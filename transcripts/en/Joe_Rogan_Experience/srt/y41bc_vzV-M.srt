1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,713
Yes.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,940
Uh, with me today, this Friday night,

3
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:24,800
you can catch him live on spike TV.
Glory 19 rights number 19.

4
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,880
Yes sir. Stitch my Joe
Schilling live from Los Angeles.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,630
Welcome aboard brother. Pull that sucker
right up to your face. Don't be shy.

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,720
You're drinking distilled water.
Huh? That's uh, to cut weight.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,200
Is that what that is? Yes
sir. How much she cut? Uh mm.

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,030
I try to cut like 12 pounds of water.
Maybe a little less, but uh, the process,

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,920
it's like five gallons
of water over three days.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,230
Is there like a science
to this or is this like,

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,470
does everybody do the same thing or
like it seems like a lot of people have

12
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:53,110
different methods on how to do this.
Yeah,

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,980
a lot of people have different
messages and methods of,

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,970
I read about it online probably five
years ago from some wrestler and we tried

15
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,820
it and it worked really well for me,
so I just keep the same way. But uh,

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,810
I'll do two gallons of water,
like my Wayne's on Thursday.
So I started on Sunday,

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,610
two gallons of distilled water on Sunday,

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,190
right?
Yeah.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,040
Two gallons on Sunday,
two gallons on Monday,

20
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:16,480
one gallon Tuesday to Wednesday,
and then Wednesday for 24 hours.

21
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:21,220
I won't drink any water, no salt, and just
kind of comes right off. So Wednesday,

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,510
no water all the way through Thursday.
No water the way ends a Thursday. Yeah.

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,550
And because of the distilled water,

24
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:30,820
because this distilled water has no
minerals in it, it's just pure water.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,430
It just flushes through your system.
Is that the idea behind it?

26
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,563
And it hasn't had,

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,000
it doesn't have any minerals so that
your body doesn't hold on to it.

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,680
And because it's flushing through system,

29
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:43,150
it pulls all the other minerals out with
it. So you know, the first two days, uh,

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,420
you just pee and like crazy, you're
sweating like crazy. Put on deodorant,

31
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,440
you're still sweating like crazy.

32
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,710
Your body feels like it's over
flooded with water and uh,

33
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,750
that last 24 hour period, it's still in
that same cycle and you're, you know,

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,130
the rest of the water just
comes right out. Yeah. See,

35
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:59,440
I would think that that
would be not good for you.

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,410
That's probably not distilled water.
It just seems like,

37
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,690
cause I know my friend Aubrey,
he went on um,

38
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,630
this weird diet of a distilled water,

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,130
like he thought like distilled water be
pure and he started getting dizzy and

40
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:15,170
shit. I think you, and he
went and got himself checked
out and they're like, dude,

41
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:18,430
you don't have any fucking minerals in
your system. Like you can't be doing that.

42
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,700
It's definitely not a healthy
thing. It's not a, you know,

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,280
I definitely don't advocate it for
anything other than cutting weight.

44
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,020
What do you weigh in at a one 87 weigh
in at one 87 you walk around somewhere

45
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:32,880
around, if I'm walking around like maybe
six weeks ago, it was probably like two,

46
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,070
10 to 12, you know, if that's
eating whatever I want, you know,

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,130
drinking beer and doing whatever I
want to do is everybody's got their own

48
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:43,150
little ideas about what should be done
as far as like how much weight to cut

49
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,080
before you compete.

50
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,400
Some guys think cut the minimum amount
possible and then there's these extreme

51
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:53,110
dudes that cut like 30, 40 pounds. Yeah.
Uh, it really comes down to everybody.

52
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:57,340
And then also like your style of fighting.
Some guys I think need to feel strong,

53
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,280
a lot bigger and stronger because
maybe they're lacking or because they,

54
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,090
you know, whatever reason they need to be
bigger and stronger than the other guy.

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,620
But this is a hindrance.
You know,

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,940
I've cut too much weight and over hydrated
and learned lessons that way where,

57
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,260
you know, yeah. I think when I fought
Simon mark is the second time. Um,

58
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,820
when I flew to Vegas,

59
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,080
I still had like one gallon of distilled
water I supposed to drink and they

60
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,390
wouldn't let me take it on the plane,
giant gallon of water.

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,930
And as soon as I landed they had me do
impress and stuff and I didn't get to

62
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,120
drink that last gallon of water.
Um,

63
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,550
so I started drinking coffee like
crazy thinking. Well that's diuretic.

64
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,480
It helped me lose the water.

65
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,870
And when that 24 hour period came
or it was time to get the weight,

66
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,690
I hadn't really dropped anything.
I was still like 22 pounds over.

67
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,490
So I had to cut 22 pounds
and 24 hours and Whoa.

68
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,190
It was terrible. It was
awful. I've seen, you know,

69
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,580
the first round I came out
strong, I was, I felt really good.

70
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:52,060
And then after the second round
it was like, it was almost like,

71
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,790
you know when you have a dream and
you've tried to fight somebody but you're

72
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,940
laying on your arm, you can't get the
wrench off. It was just like that. And uh,

73
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,100
yeah, it was a bad performance.
So I learned from that one a lot.

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,000
The point of diminishing returns.

75
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,490
That's a big one when it comes
to weight cutting, right? It's,

76
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:09,720
it's almost like a whole nother event
in itself. There's like the fight,

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,930
the training for the fight,
the preparation skills,
training and conditioning,

78
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:13,764
all that jazz.

79
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,160
And then there's this weight cutting
thing that's a totally different event.

80
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,240
And guys fail at it. Like this past
weekend, two big important fights.

81
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:25,200
The guys failed that at John Linacre
failed for like the fifth fucking time.

82
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:29,570
The Guy can't make one 25 but he
wants to be the bigger guy. You know,

83
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,450
he doesn't want to fight one 35 and then
Calvin, Kelvin Gaslamp's same thing.

84
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,500
Couldn't, couldn't make one 70
for like the fourth time. It's,

85
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,770
I don't know how many times Calvin's
Ms, not as many as Linacre, but he's,

86
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,320
you know,
he's cutting it close many times.

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,000
He got a guy like Anthony
Johnson. It was like, really?

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,620
I had a really bad reputation in the UFC.

89
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,560
He got cut because he couldn't
make weight and then, uh,

90
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,620
finally decided to stick to his natural
weight and he's killing it, you know?

91
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,350
So it's ridiculous. It's a,
it's a weird balancing act.

92
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:59,080
I think everybody has their own,
you know, you've got to learn,

93
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,870
learn your lessons and work from anywhere.

94
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,890
There's never been a guy like
Johnson who like at one 70, you know,

95
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,660
he's a good fighter,
very good,

96
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:10,230
but struggles to make weight and then
Fades Leighton fights because he's

97
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:11,550
depleting the shit out of his body,

98
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,490
goes all the way up to heavyweight
and beats the shit out.

99
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,690
Andre Arlovski and you're like,
what the fuck? A heavyweight.

100
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,650
And then drops down to two oh five to
compete in the UFC. Makes wait no problem.

101
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:26,850
And is the number one contender now and
just terrifying, terrifying fighter.

102
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,700
Amazing.

103
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,430
It's amazing how this guy like not
torturing his body is now one of the best

104
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:36,170
fighters on earth. Whereas three
years ago he didn't have a career.

105
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:39,090
It's career was fucked up all
just because of weight cutting.

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,510
Yeah. You know, it's a, it's a
weird, weird thing, you know, uh,

107
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,010
if you don't do the weight cutting and
the, or we did like same day wanes,

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,380
then you still have guys that are going
to try to cut the weight and fight the

109
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:50,990
same.

110
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,880
Yeah. Healthy. You know, it's terrible
boy, especially striking sports.

111
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,600
It's terrible for you with wrestling,
but guys get away with it. Um,

112
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,970
but with combat sports, anytime you're,
you were involving head strikes you,

113
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,250
you really don't have enough time to
replenish all the water that protects your

114
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,070
brain, all the water
in your, in your head.

115
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,070
And that was one of the issues that
people used to have back in the old days

116
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,050
where these to Wayne and
fight on the same day.

117
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,530
They changed that around the
duck. Who Kim fight, I believe.

118
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:23,510
It's also when they dropped it from 15
rounds to 12 or boxing because they just

119
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,320
felt like 15 is too long and they
changed the bus. The uh, the gloves.

120
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,440
Heavyweights used to wear Aidan's
clothes and then now it's,

121
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:34,370
I think you have to be under one 45,
two B. Any downs? Clothes. Wow. I mean,

122
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,380
can you imagine heavyweight
fighting with Aiden's clothes?

123
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,160
It's basically just a
different style, you know? Wow.

124
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,940
Well how about the Jack Johnson days
where they used to wear those Everlast bag

125
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,840
gloves? There's a little tea. They were
just Bexley knuckle pads. That's crazy.

126
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,120
Well, there's some guys that
think, and I'm, I'm one of them,

127
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:54,800
that MMA would probably be more realistic
and better if no one wore gloves.

128
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,130
I feel like if you can need someone in
the face, elbows, someone in the face,

129
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,180
kick someone in the face, why you
punched him in the face with gloves on.

130
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,100
It just protects your hands more
than anything. And also the wrists,

131
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,250
like having your wrist
taped up nice and solid.

132
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,680
Like it makes it so that
you can hit people harder.

133
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,000
You could be much more careless with your
punches. Like if you had bare knuckles,

134
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,150
it would be a much more realistic like
scenario as far as like what you can do

135
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,210
with your body,

136
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,100
you've and everything up and wrap and
everything nice and tight and solid and

137
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,440
padding it, you know, you're turning
your hand to a different thing. Right?

138
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,050
Well it's like some athletic commissions
allow you to tape your ankle.

139
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,640
Some people, some athletic
nutritionists don't, you know,
if you watch like the, uh,

140
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,830
like the okay ones and stuff,
you'll see like butter, hurry in.

141
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,790
And these guys have like a huge amount
of padding placed over their ankle and

142
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,850
their foot that padding is not
protecting the person they're hitting is

143
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:47,990
protecting you.
So if you're,

144
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,290
if you're ripping kicks and you kick
somebody in the elbow, you know,

145
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,120
and you have a pad on it,
it's going to protect you.

146
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,000
You're gonna be more likely
to keep kicking then if you
smashed your foot in the

147
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,880
first one. So yeah, it's
kind of interesting. Yeah.

148
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:02,300
I think protected teeth
protect your balls. That's it.

149
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,370
I think maybe that's the best way to go,

150
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,400
but everybody has this thing where it
would look more barbaric if somehow or

151
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,990
another your knuckles
weren't protected bright.

152
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,450
Well then also you've got to look at
it from like a promotion standpoint.

153
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:17,180
You know, if everybody was breaking
their hands and, and fights, you know,

154
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:20,080
they wouldn't, as a fan we wouldn't
get to see those fights, you know,

155
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,660
as often as we'd like to do to see
them. You know. So that is true.

156
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,070
But when you talk about like,
uh,

157
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,500
like the impact on the problems
with brain damage and, and you know,

158
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,270
the side effects for
guys after their career,

159
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:35,320
can you imagine if we had even less
padding on our hands and you know, it's,

160
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,720
well they think that there would be
actually less brain damage cause guys

161
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:39,740
wouldn't get hit as much.

162
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:44,340
You'd have to be much more judicious with
where you placed your punches and you

163
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,880
know, because of the fact that you, you
know, if you hit somebody in the forehead,

164
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,040
you're most likely going to
snap your knuckles. Right.

165
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,060
He'd be a little bit more careful. I
don't know. It's a weird argument. Yeah.

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,030
It's like the same argument with,
they've said that if

167
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,470
football players didn't have pads,
it didn't have helmets,

168
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,730
it would be a safer game for the players.
But of course it put football,

169
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,530
they're not punching each
other in the face. Yeah.

170
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:06,660
And there's always going to
be that one guy that like,

171
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,330
just like the one gift
they did same day way.

172
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,970
And there's always gonna be that one guy
that thinks he can still cut 30 pounds

173
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:14,140
and fight the day of guys are,
yeah.

174
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,310
The one guy who doesn't care and keeps
hitting the person when his hands broken,

175
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,340
you know? That's, uh, yeah,
that's true. That's true.

176
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,490
So you were in camp with Nick Diaz and
preparation for his fight this past

177
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,560
weekend with Anderson Silva, which
was an amazing fight. You know,

178
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,530
and I've been thinking a lot about
that fight after it was over.

179
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,660
And one of the things that really,
um,

180
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,220
really like locked into my
head was there's a lot of
people that are calling for

181
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,950
Anderson to retire now. You know, and
they're saying that, uh, you know,

182
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,980
and even Chris Weidman is one of them.
He said he'd like to see Anderson retire,

183
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,950
but I watched the fight and I was
thinking about myself after the fight,

184
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,240
like with nick in,
in Silva,

185
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,300
that was a better fight then nick and
Carlos condit it was a better fight then

186
00:09:56,611 --> 00:10:01,020
GSP and nick, like, these are,
these are, it was a good fight.

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,940
It was a good competitive,
exciting fight. And, um, you know,

188
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:09,170
Anderson Silva fighting nick the
Nick Diaz is a tough motherfucker.

189
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,950
He's a good fighter. He's very smart
and very crafty. And I think that,

190
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:18,060
uh, you know, like the guy coming off of
those two fights, it's almost like just,

191
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:21,840
we expect more of him then have
just a regular fighter. Like,

192
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,410
like if that was GSP in his prime and
he put on the exact same performance and

193
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:29,400
if you just, you know, CGI GSPs body
and made someone watched the fight,

194
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,740
this good fight while at the
beginning was kind of ridiculous.

195
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,510
Nick was clowning him, which was
hilarious. I was howling laughing.

196
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,220
I couldn't,
I couldn't stop myself.

197
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,880
I was slapping the table when he laid
down and put his head like he's taking a

198
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,370
nap. We were in the corner
laughing. He couldn't believe it.

199
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,980
I was worried about him, you
know, going into the fight.

200
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:51,570
I felt a lot of responsibility for him,
uh, kickboxing wise, you know. Right.

201
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,350
And I felt like my, my job
helping him out, you know,
he's one of my good friends.

202
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,890
I played with him anyway,
but in this fight at a camp,

203
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,710
I was kind of more of a coaching and
um, I felt a lot of responsibility. No,

204
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,780
not him, not to get caught.
And you know, did I teach him,

205
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,090
did I teach them the right things
that I tell them enough stuff,

206
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,430
felt like a lot of
responsibility. And, uh,

207
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,320
you're gonna be yelling out
instructions or whatever.

208
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,070
And he did that and then I was like,
you know,

209
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,350
and then he stood up and walked right
out and with his hands down, I'm like, I,

210
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,520
I'll get fucking hit. Right, right, right.
But yeah, I was super proud of him. Um,

211
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,900
yeah, that, that's happened to me
in the past too, with the, you know,

212
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,810
when I fought calculi nobody,
nobody thought it was going to win.

213
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,850
That was Joe's going to get destroyed,
you know,

214
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,560
and I was the only one that
believed that I was gonna win.

215
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,330
And then once I had to beat
him decisively, then it
was all he should retire.

216
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:38,640
He's not good anymore. And I think
that's just not fair. You know,

217
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:42,140
it's like the guy comes
back from, uh, you know,

218
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,030
two losses and one of them was a horrific,
you know,

219
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,320
Shin break and then Nick Diaz does,
wouldn't, you know, before the fight,

220
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,540
everyone thought nick wasn't going
to go more than one round. You know,

221
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,010
he was going to get murdered
by the, you know, and

222
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,230
then nick puts on a great
performance. Anderson, you know,

223
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,440
Nick's hard to fight and it's
hard to finish, you know,

224
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:02,710
but then all of a sudden it's all he,
he's not the same guy. He's, he's,

225
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,710
he should retire. I just think that's
not fair for Anderson or for Nick.

226
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,840
Yeah, I agree. I think
Anderson did, like I said,

227
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:11,390
I think he did better
than Carlos condit did.

228
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,190
He did better than
George Saint Pierre did.

229
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,710
George essentially fought
him a little bit on the feet,

230
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:17,120
but most of the fight he took them down,
you know,

231
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,860
and tried to take them down
and control on the ground.

232
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:23,450
And Georgia is a very strong guy. He's
got real good top control. But you know,

233
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,740
Anderson stood up with him and
the entire fight was taking place,

234
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,400
kickboxing and I think
Anderson looked good, you know,

235
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,060
and especially when you come off to big
losses like that and your head's all

236
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:38,750
fucked up and you know, everybody's
calling on you to retire first of all,

237
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:41,300
the first fight had to
fuck with his confidence.

238
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,990
So hard to it did that cause he
was clowning and he got caught,

239
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:48,440
which is everyone's worst nightmare
because like when you're clowning,

240
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,840
you're trying to make fun of
your opponent and then boom,

241
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:54,140
you get cracked with a big left hook
and the lights go out and you're like no

242
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:58,550
way that way. Like to lose that
way after all those victories,

243
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,650
after the Vito Belfort fight,

244
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:05,360
after fucking up jail son and in the
rematch and after all those spectacular

245
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:09,940
victories against James Irvin
and Forrest Griffin. And so,

246
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,950
you know, to lose like
that, I was like, Holy Shit.

247
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,650
Yeah. I mean that's, that
was w going into the camp,

248
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,130
I was looking at stuff cause you know,

249
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,150
it was a really tough fight
for nick and uh, you know,

250
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,430
a lot of people didn't think he was gonna,
you know,

251
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,840
Forrest Griffin when the fight
first came out so that, you know,

252
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:27,570
it was just silly fight.
It wasn't, I don't know, I
wouldn't call it a super fight,

253
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:29,040
you know, he's just too
small for that, you know,

254
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,160
and I think a lot of people count or not.

255
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,680
But when I was looking
at Anderson's fights, um,

256
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,730
things that I noticed where people would
say he was showboating or whatever,

257
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:43,450
I think that when it didn't
go his way against, uh, uh,

258
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,510
Chris Weidman,
the first time he started,

259
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,510
he kind of broken mentally and
that's why he started showboating.

260
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,130
And I had done that in
the past and paid for it.

261
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,840
But ultimately I think that his style
is to bait people into coming so he can

262
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:58,920
use his reach and then catching
them a shot. So with Nick, you know,

263
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,940
my thing was you have to find that
middle range somehow, you know,

264
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,840
either get him to come at you or go
just enough that you're inside of that

265
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:07,674
middle range,

266
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,590
but not go all the way into the clinch
and get and get stuck in his clinch,

267
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,570
you know. And, uh, that was,

268
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:15,630
I think I had a lot to do with
nick baiting him to come forward.

269
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,480
And then I think I also messed with
a Anderson's head. No one's ever,

270
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,820
no one's ever clown to Anderson.
You know,

271
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:25,050
a lot of these guys go in there and they,
uh, one I think they get surprised by,

272
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,530
there's not prepared to fight that
level of kickboxing. You know,

273
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:31,980
they're not used to seeing that, that
level of striking, that speed, that range,

274
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:34,770
those, those moves. And then the
other thing is that they, uh,

275
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,750
they get out there and they're
like, I'm fighting, you know,

276
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,240
the best striker in the world.
This is the goat is the goal.

277
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,510
And I think that was a big
thing for nick was, you know,

278
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,990
I don't think nick police for a second
that he's the greatest fighter of all

279
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:48,320
time. You know what I mean?
And same thing with jail son.

280
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,300
And the first time he fought him,
chill,

281
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,690
fun for all this stuff that she'll said
chair really believed he was going to

282
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,710
beat Anderson Silva that night, which
is why he did beat him for, you know,

283
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,740
almost the entire fight until he got
caught. I think the second fight might be,

284
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:01,550
it was a little different,

285
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,490
but I think mostly the guys that he fought
didn't really think that they could,

286
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,450
they didn't visualize themselves winning
that fight and that gave it to Anderson.

287
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,720
Well, Anderson is a great counter striker
and that's always been what he's most

288
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:16,090
spectacular at. I mean, he will lead,

289
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:19,480
but most of the time he only does
it when he has a massive advantage.

290
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:22,030
Like the first couple of
rounds against Damien Maia,

291
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,680
like he was going after Maya.

292
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,320
But Damien Maia is like applauding guy
who doesn't have good strike where his

293
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:30,610
speech, especially back then,
it didn't have good striking.

294
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,460
But like if you look at like the tallest
latest fight or if you look at, um, um,

295
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,730
the Patrick [inaudible] fight, he likes
to lay back and let guys come to him.

296
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,400
And when guys just stand there
and wait for him to come,

297
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,270
the fights get really boring.
Like he,

298
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,140
he was involved in a few stinkers
everybody kind of forgot about.

299
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,290
And that was because he's not really,

300
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,440
he's not the attacking style of fighter.
Like,

301
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:56,740
there's some guys that just fucking
attack. They just go like rumble.

302
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,310
Like Anthony Johnson goes
after you bell rings,

303
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,410
he's charging at you throwing bombs.

304
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,450
Anderson has never been
that kind of a fight.

305
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,970
It's always been like
much more of a tactician.

306
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,470
And then there's always the
air of invincibility. Right.

307
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,350
But that air of invincibility is
gone. It's completely gone. Gone.

308
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,700
I think it's gone. It was so weird seeing
him like weeping after the fight too.

309
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,130
And then nick goes and picks him up.
That was pretty bad as you know.

310
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,190
And Nick was like, come on
man, you can't be crying. Yeah,

311
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,990
you're the greatest of all time.
You can't be crying.

312
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,380
You know, Nick and Nate, they get a
painted to be these like bad guys.

313
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:31,210
And you know, that's part of
the persona that, you know,

314
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,690
they promote and that that's all
well and good, but like they're very,

315
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:39,160
very respectful. But you know, when the,
um, uh, when nick beat Frank Shamrock,

316
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:42,250
he was on the ground after the fight and
nick reached down and picked him up and

317
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,090
said, you know, you're a legend. You can't
be on the floor stand up or whatever.

318
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,080
Yeah. And this is, but all
people see is, you know,

319
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,220
they go for the stare down at the
press conference and Netflix him off.

320
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:52,540
And frank shamrock grabs his balls.

321
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:57,130
But they're both very respectful fighters
and uh, you know, uh, I think they get,

322
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,710
they get a bad rap sometimes.
Well, he definitely gets

323
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,010
crazy before the fight and anxious and,
but that's to be expected.

324
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:08,660
And the shit talking. Look, son
Sue said it and the art of war,

325
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:13,160
you know, uh, Miyamoto Musashi talked
about it and the book of five rings ditch,

326
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,510
there's all sorts of things that go
on in a fight and, and any contest,

327
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,800
there's advantages to be had and there's
mental advantages that if you do not

328
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:24,560
take advantage of those mental
advantages and your opponent does,

329
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,700
you're at a disadvantage.

330
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,030
And when nick immediately
starts to fight and he's like,

331
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:32,210
he's got his hands out to, to
Anderson, like what Bitch, what pitch?

332
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,550
And he's walking towards him, come on,
what the fuck you going to do? Come on,

333
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,180
what are you gonna do?

334
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,780
And you see him talking like constantly
talking and you'd just see Anderson,

335
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,290
like people get flustered
when nick does that big time.

336
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,260
He does it in sparring to, does he
really? Yeah, he does look good.

337
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,870
My Mat Nicho was brought in
for actually the, uh, for, uh,

338
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,700
Nate's fight with violence. Roney
and when it got to the gym, uh,

339
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,750
Nate had hurt his neck or something,
was going to the,

340
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,800
had to go to the chiropractor
or something and they were like,

341
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:01,290
I'll just wait Nickleby here you can
spar with nick. And I was like, okay.

342
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,070
So like nick shows up and I'm a big
fan of these guys, you know, like just,

343
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,540
I was kind of like, you
know, a little struck and uh,
nick shows up and he's just,

344
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,460
yeah, I'm like totally coached
upon me. And I was like, so

345
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,520
are we going to spar it? We're
going to fire at night. He's like,

346
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,690
unifier right now, you know,
and it, but it was just like,

347
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,810
just like he walks into the
cage, you know, kind of like,

348
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,740
just look at me up and down kind of thing.
And then, you know, we, we sparked it.

349
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,160
It was really hard.
We had like a really good,

350
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,750
a really hard session and after
that he was like kickboxing, Huh.

351
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,800
So yeah, if you want to
hang out after, you know,

352
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:38,370
and we started hanging out
after that, but it was, uh,

353
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,750
it was very much like a like is, you
know, that's, that's who he is, you know?

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,800
It's uh, yeah. What kind of insight can
you give us to, why is he liked that?

355
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:49,920
Like what is, uh, what's
going on behind behind eyes?

356
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,410
Honestly, I couldn't, you know, I
spent a mix, a good friend of mine,

357
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:01,860
I couldn't tell you what the hell is going
on in his head. That's just who he is.

358
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,630
Um, I think he gets people thinking like
he doesn't know what he's doing or he's

359
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:08,250
crazy,
but I guarantee like he,

360
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,720
once you figure out and he knows
exactly what he's doing all the time,

361
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:15,400
like there was a plan, which they're
totally is, then, uh, you know, you,

362
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,940
you're worried about him sometime.
Like what'd he, what's he doing? Well,

363
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:21,840
he's an enigma and far it's like you look
at the way he behaves. You Go, oh, okay,

364
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,000
well this is like a thug was just treat
guy. And then you find out, oh no, no, no.

365
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,220
He's, he's on this incredibly
clean, organic diet.

366
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,140
He runs triathlons on a regular basis.
The fucking guy swims back from Alcatraz.

367
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,800
I mean, he's just an incredible
endurance athlete is not,

368
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,980
this is not like a dummy.
This is a very calculated guy.

369
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,090
Legit black belt in Jujitsu. Like
very, very good on the ground.

370
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:49,890
His boxing's outstanding. There's
too much good. There's too much.

371
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:54,350
Like too much preparation. Too much
discipline, too much intelligence in,

372
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,280
in the way he carries himself inside
the inside the, the competition.

373
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,300
He's not dumb at all. He's not
though. No, he's very smart.

374
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:06,720
And he's an enigma. Yeah. Some of the
stuff he talks about it, it's just like,

375
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,120
you know, I want to like take notes,
you know, like the Diet stuff.

376
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:12,710
He's always on me. My Shit. If I drink
rock stars in energy drinks, you know,

377
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,160
smoked cigarettes from time to time.
He's like, he's just very much not,

378
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,840
did the cigarette thing come from ty
from training Muay Thai because so many

379
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:26,280
ties, smoke cigarettes. Um, it started
when I was a kid, you know, uh,

380
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,670
my, my dad always smoked my, my
step, I'm over smoke. My brothers,

381
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,950
I'm the youngest of three.
They were smooth from Ohio.

382
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:34,380
Everybody was smoking back in the day.
And I just started when I was a kid.

383
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,970
And then I think when I started
doing kickboxing it was more like,

384
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,360
okay. Like there was other,
I guess I made excuses.

385
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,460
There was other people that smoke
cigarettes kind of thing. I mean,

386
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:48,010
I don't have a kid at all, but I'm not,
you know how often you smoke cigarettes?

387
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,740
I smoke cigarettes pretty
often. Really? Like right now.

388
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,140
He'd just woken right now while
you're in training? Yup. No Shit. No,

389
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,980
I like a pack a day. Uh, I tried to go

390
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,640
back, you know, when I'm having
fights, um, just because you know,

391
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,100
from running I'm training really hard.
But yeah, I'm a regular small group.

392
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,680
Cigarettes,

393
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,670
Jesus Christ job.
It's not a terrible,

394
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,710
I'm not going to hide who I am.
You know, some people do, uh,

395
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,380
have vices and whatnot,

396
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,470
but what's incredible is you fought
and I fucking glory tournament,

397
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:19,050
which was a brutal tournament
which I went to in La.

398
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:22,920
It was amazing that fight
with Simon markets. When I
went into the fourth round,

399
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,930
he caught him with that right hand.
First of all,

400
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,680
that is a fucking war for one fight.

401
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,930
But the fact that you had a fight three
fucking times in a night against world

402
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:37,110
class fighters like that,
Wayne Barrett and your next fight,

403
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,770
Jesus Christ and then Levon,
right leaven in the finals,

404
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:45,600
who's one of the best in the world. That
is a crazy fucking night of combat. Yeah,

405
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,570
it was. It was. It was nuts.

406
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,630
What the fuck is the next day feel like
you have to that man, it was terrible.

407
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,840
How many seconds does he smoke?
The next day I got a mannequin.

408
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:56,410
We let me say this,
so after this

409
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,180
man, don't smoke case cigarettes,
kids, it's bad for it. Don't smoke.

410
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:06,170
You don't smoke. It's really
not a joke. And like people,

411
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,380
you constantly hear shit from people
like Joe and Nick and all of the other

412
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,270
people that you don't, you don't get, um,

413
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,360
people don't want to
respect you as much weed.

414
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:17,200
He smoked cigarettes and make
dumb choices like that. And,

415
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,340
and the fighting community, you
know, it is a, it is what it is,

416
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:23,430
but will you have great cardio, which
is weird. I trained really hard.

417
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,670
I'm a very hard worker when it's
time to buckle down, like I buckled.

418
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,220
But how much of an edge do you think
you would have more if you didn't have?

419
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,260
I've thought about that for a long
time. I'm like, God damn dude,

420
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,790
probably would have more of an edge,

421
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,810
but like you might be the
baddest motherfucker ever
if you quit cigarettes. Uh,

422
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,170
well I don't think I'm that far off
from it now to be honest. It's true.

423
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,450
Pretty close. Pretty
close. Um, but, uh, yeah,

424
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,300
after I knocked out Simon
and the glory a tournament,

425
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,110
we're in the back dressing room and, you
know, they want me to lay down an ice,

426
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:57,020
me and all that stuff. And
I'm like, coach, let's go
outside. Let's go, you know,

427
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,770
you smoked a cigarette in my wedding.

428
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,220
I went outside after a Simon and I had
my hands wrapped and walking out in the

429
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:06,330
security's like, where are you going?
And be like, I'll be right back.

430
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,560
Smoke cigarette, calm down a little bit,
felt a little better. And then, um, yeah,

431
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:15,410
I felt it w it was such a insane night
that night after the Simon fight.

432
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,580
It was, I was really pumped,
but like I was banged up,

433
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,930
but it felt I was really on like this
high from beating him and he had beat me

434
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:26,640
twice in the past. And it was really a,
it was a big moment for me. And then, uh,

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,120
the Wayne Barrett fight was
just a really frustrating,

436
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,470
it was a really mentally challenging
fight. You know, his style really. Uh,

437
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,100
the first time we fought it
really frustrated me and I,

438
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,910
I did what Anderson did with,
um,

439
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,900
with Weidman the first time I kind of
cracked under like the frustration I put

440
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:46,340
my hands on my hips and you know, I
kind of gave away fights. What style?

441
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,700
Like describe his style of, it's
just very, it's very different.

442
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:52,190
It's almost like he makes it a piece.
He's got very strong box.

443
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:54,260
He's got heavy hands,
he's very, he's very big.

444
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,050
He was the first person
I fought at one 85,

445
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,310
where the guy that I weighed in against
and the guy got in the ring with for two

446
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:04,880
very different sizes, you know, and um,
that messed with me a little bit, but he,

447
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,370
he was running away. He,
uh, not running away,

448
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:10,730
but he was trying to use his movement.
And every time I would try to throw,

449
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:15,590
I just got really frustrated by him
not, not engaging me, you know. And, um,

450
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,440
that was something I had to
really learn from. And uh,

451
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,230
going into the second fight, I was
ready for that, prepared for it.

452
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:23,700
And I knew it was going to be an ugly
fight and it wasn't going to be, uh,

453
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,831
you know,

454
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:27,770
the type of fight that I really liked
that Simon is the type of guy I like to

455
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:31,370
fight. You know, I like to
be in essentially like a
war. Let's fight, let's,

456
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,490
let's get it on,
you know.

457
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:36,740
And Wayne was like stepping backwards
and put his foot on the rope and jumping

458
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,770
off the ropes and like doing
like a lot of weird stuff.

459
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,650
That was just frustrating for me.
So I had to stay focused in that fight.

460
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,490
And then I got the w I honestly didn't
know who won the fight because it was so

461
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
neither one of us were really scoring.
But you know,

462
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,010
after watching the video I see
that I want to fight. Um, and then,

463
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,170
so I had about 30 minutes after the
Simon fight before I got up for Wayne.

464
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,660
But after the Wayne fight, it was like
go in the back, change your gloves.

465
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:01,610
And it was, there was one
fight between us. It was,

466
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:05,540
I think it was like nine minutes before
I was back in the ring again and I was

467
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:09,110
walking to the ring and I
just kept thinking like, how
the fuck am I going to do?

468
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,770
Like what am I, this is like my
calling, like this is fucking crazy.

469
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:14,800
And it was in the back and
he was just like, don't,

470
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,130
how the fuck are going to do this dude?

471
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,670
Like my legs were just not at all up and
down. My face hurt from headbutts and,

472
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,450
and getting dropped when, when, uh,

473
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,060
Simon dropped me in the second
round and the first fight, um,

474
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,020
he hit me right on the chin and it
didn't really affect me mentally.

475
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:31,220
I never got rocked by it.

476
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,760
My legs went out right away and I felt
all of the punch, like in my neck.

477
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:38,620
It was like pop up and my neck and uh,
yeah, walking out to fight our Tim,

478
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,290
I was just really proud
that I had the balls,

479
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,270
I guess to do what I was doing.
Like I was,

480
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,750
I was more like in shock of what
I was capable of, but I didn't,

481
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,130
I really didn't feel like I had anything
left to win the fight. You know what?

482
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,210
I was on my way to the ring
and I was just really proud.

483
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,470
That's some archaic shit.

484
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,490
Those three fights in one night to get
world class fighters to fight three times

485
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:05,080
in one night. Like, uh, I went there
and I talked to Kevin K who you know,

486
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,000
is one of the big wigs over it. Spike and
I said, this is awesome. Like, you know,

487
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,340
the, the, this event is awesome.
These fighters are awesome.

488
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,000
It's so cool that you guys have worldclass
kickboxing go but fuck all this crazy

489
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:20,400
fighting three fights in one night. I go,
this is dangerous. This is not smart. I,

490
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:22,240
if you guys lose somebody because of this,

491
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:24,850
if someone dies like a worldclass
guy dies because of this,

492
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,270
you guys look like assholes. Like
don't do this anymore. Yeah. I mean,

493
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:32,140
I don't know if it's that
dramatic. I mean, I couldn't
be, if a guy gets through,

494
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:33,730
right.
It could be if you have a war,

495
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,630
if a guy has a war with another guy and
gets dropped three or four times in a

496
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:41,680
fight, like you know some fucking
George Foreman, Ron Lyle type shit,

497
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,070
what they just blasting each
the back and forth and one guy

498
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,520
manages to just get through by the
skin of his teeth and then he gets head

499
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:51,370
kicked and hour later by somebody else.
That shit is no Bueno. Right. You know,

500
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,660
and that is a possibility. Like
you fight, you should be able,

501
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,050
you should fight once in a night. You
know, you, you're, you're in camp,

502
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,130
you're training for a long time. I mean,
obviously you can do it, you did it,

503
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,510
but if you had a,

504
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,280
if you had your choice to be at your best
to fight a guy like 11 yeah. You know,

505
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,990
you want to,
you want to be at your best,

506
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:12,540
you want to go through a full training
camp and you don't want to have two

507
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,670
fights that fucking day,

508
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,380
nine minutes before you fight one
of the best kickboxers on earth.

509
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,420
And it's like when you're
going into that tournament,

510
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,680
both times that if I live in your,
your training campus for that first fight,

511
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,200
you know, and then in the back of
your mind somewhere, it's like, oh,

512
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,900
well if I get to the next round,
like if it could be this guy,

513
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:31,711
it could be that guy.

514
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:34,710
You kind of try to get some
sort of game plan for everybody.

515
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:37,350
But then the third fight after
that, you're just, you know,

516
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:41,510
I hadn't even thought about getting to
11 in that tournament or how I was gonna

517
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,000
fight him. It was beating Simon
who had beat me twice, you know,

518
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:48,120
and then beating Wayne and
then, you know, it was just a,

519
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,510
it was really tough and yet neither
one. I mean, it wasn't at my best,

520
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,520
obviously it was,
it was all beat up when I fought him.

521
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:57,180
So I think the fans deserve to
see, you know, same thing with, uh,

522
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,220
with the first time I fought a 11.

523
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:02,430
It was the second fight in a tournament
that we fought. And, uh, yeah,

524
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,090
it would be really nice to see really who
is, who's the best, who's the, you know,

525
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,953
on when they're on there.
Yeah,

526
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,930
yeah, that's true. Right.

527
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:11,050
The first time you fought him was
the second fight in a tournament too.

528
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
That's so crazy, man. And that turned out

529
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,870
was nuts because I was supposed
to fight Steve Wakeling,

530
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,100
which at the time was the
number two guy in the world.

531
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,310
And then I knew that I'd be fighting 11
in the final just because of his matchup

532
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,940
and a like six days before the fight
Wakeland pulled out of the fight and they

533
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:29,630
gave me Kingo Shimizu who I'd never
heard of who was like the Japanese,

534
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,880
a champion who used to fight a heavyweight
and was coming down to the middle

535
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,300
weight and uh,
you know,

536
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,270
I had like six days to watch tape on
him and try to figure out a strategy. So

537
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,110
11 such a slippery guy too. You were the
first guy to ever catch him like that,

538
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,780
you know, you had him really fucking
hurt. Like I thought he was done. Like,

539
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,320
Kudos to that guy for getting through it
because you cracked him and then on the

540
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:53,060
way down you caught him with a knee.

541
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,150
I think that knee actually will come
up to be honest. And why I watch it.

542
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,780
I was like, he was dropping like he was
out on the way down and then my knee,

543
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:03,590
I think it was like that second impact,
like kind of brought him back. But yeah,

544
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,660
I couldn't believe you got,
how weird is it that that's real.

545
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,130
Like guys had been knocked back, awake,
right, knocked out and then boom,

546
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,770
they get hit again and then all of
a sudden they're back in the fight.

547
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,720
It's very shit a lot in the UFC,

548
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:18,590
whether these guys are out limp and
then right when the ref breaks and there

549
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,580
they're going for a leg or they know
they're coming back to sort of, um, yeah.

550
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,180
You see guys had their eyes roll back
behind their head and then they get hit

551
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,350
again and it's almost like
they refocus like the,

552
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,720
the new jolt of electricity to
their brain, like clear, you know?

553
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:35,920
It's very weird. That's another
thing, like with the mean,

554
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,880
we've seen it with like Dan Henderson
and some of those fights were like, oh,

555
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:39,320
he's out.
And then he comes back,

556
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:44,200
or like a check Congo when his fight
with a guy, I can't remember his name.

557
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,030
The Guy Pat Barry. Yeah. Like he was gone
and then call it, came back and hit him.

558
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:52,900
You know. So Pat Barry fight with
Molly. Casa was hard to watch. Yeah,

559
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,770
that was hard to watch.
Padbury is a great guy.

560
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,030
I love that dude. He's
such a fun dude. But man,

561
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:05,530
he's had some rough Kaos over the last
couple of years where he had never been

562
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:10,450
KOD. And then he gets killed by Congo
and then it gets Kale by Lavar Johnson.

563
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,290
But the movie costs one was hard to watch.
That was hard to watch.

564
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,550
That was a hell of a shot. I like that
guy, Zach. He's a, he seems like a really,

565
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,700
really good guy. He's cool. I was
happy for him, but yeah, it was a,

566
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,050
he seems like a really good guy. Um,
but he's another one. Like he's not,

567
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,280
he's not built like a fighter. He's pill
like some crazy giant bodybuilder dude,

568
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,610
which is great for like around and a half
and then you get into the third round

569
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,290
or fourth or fifth did you find
a championship fight? And like,

570
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,190
you know what you saw, he fought, uh,

571
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,360
two fights in one night in
that last tournament. Right.

572
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,800
And in the second term he just was a
different guy. He's a different guy.

573
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,000
Like whereas you can be the same guy
for the first round as you can for the

574
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,950
fifth round.
Those big guys,

575
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,370
they w we were saying earlier about
cutting all that weight, right? They just,

576
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,720
when you have that much muscle to feed,
like there's, there's definitely benefits.

577
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,210
You could bum rush a guy and you,

578
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:06,580
you're just a machine for
as long as you have oxygen.

579
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,480
But there's that weird middle balance
where you're trying to find the

580
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:15,010
comfortable middle ground between
being ridiculously strong and being an

581
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:19,540
endurance athlete. Yeah.
Terry, so could you was a, have
had issues with that, right?

582
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,700
I mean, when he first came on
the scene in pride, he's like,

583
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,500
not like just who the
hell is this? Oh, Rona.

584
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:28,450
And knocks out Nogueira and then UFC
could see like he was really strong and

585
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,830
then he would kind of
fade and then later on.

586
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:31,960
So I think he has mental issues too.

587
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,200
I think there's a little bit
of a confidence issue too
when it comes to when you

588
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,690
talk to the people that have trained
with them and the people in this camp,

589
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,570
you know, sometimes guys
get through that, you know,

590
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:44,320
Vituro went for through a long stage
where I had confidence issues and he got

591
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:49,180
through that some, you know,
it's not insurmountable, but uh,

592
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,200
but yeah, definitely the
muscle have packing all that
muscle is not good for you.

593
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,300
It's just, it doesn't, it doesn't
help you know, it, it helps a little,

594
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:00,540
makes you really strong. If
you're a grappler, you know,

595
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,480
could certainly give you some
advantage. But those guys, man,

596
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:05,410
when especially when you're,

597
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:07,990
if you're built like that and
you're trying to fight five rounds,

598
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,790
now you're taking a crazy gamble.

599
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,160
Not Gamble is I'm going to get this
guy out of there in the first couple of

600
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:14,950
rounds and then you've got a guy like
we were talking about king the Alaska is

601
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,050
just, yeah, he's huge, but it has like
a ridiculous cardio, you know, it's uh,

602
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:24,280
he's just a, Freeman's are just so weird,
right? Yeah. They vary so much, man.

603
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,390
They vary so much. You know, you
get guys that like, you know,

604
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,530
you remember cabbage? Yeah. Back in
the old day, man, I love cabbage cat,

605
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:34,120
which was awesome.
It was awesome.

606
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,930
You could hit Kabbage with a fucking tree
that you could pull a tree out of the

607
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:41,930
roots and, and climbing off the side
of his head and he would smile at you.

608
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,970
You know, that guy could just take
this unbelievable punch. Yeah.

609
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:50,570
And that's just biological. He's just born
that way. Yeah. But it's like, you know,

610
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:53,840
somebody told me that it had a great
chin and they're, the, nick had a great,

611
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,880
somebody sits on by when a
great chin and I said, you know,

612
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:58,720
don't ever say that about me doing.
Then people start telling you,

613
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,610
you can take a great shot
or you have a great chain,

614
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,330
it means your defense is bad.
You know what I mean?

615
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,810
And they can only last so long. And
then you know, you see it one guy,

616
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:08,900
you can go take shots forever.

617
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,530
Then one fight later he cannot take a
shot and like chocolate dough chocolate.

618
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,620
Dell is an end. Dan Henderson, this
last fight against Musashi, right,

619
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,610
saucy hit him with a punch that Dan would
have eaten like a tic tac earlier in

620
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:23,960
his career and his legs go. Just
everybody's got a certain amount of holes.

621
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,860
Jermaine Taylor was like that. Oh yeah,
yeah. Go with public. Knocked him out.

622
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,040
He was fantastic. Boxers still hit all
the skills but just couldn't take a punch.

623
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,090
Anyway. Yeah, this is just a a point
where you reach where you're, you know,

624
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,520
and it's also how you prepare,
right? Like how much you,

625
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,750
how many shots were taken in the
gym, you know, and how are you,

626
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,330
how are we training?
Are you training smart defensively?

627
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:48,260
Some guys are just fucking full pedal
to the metal on offense. You know?

628
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:50,540
That's how they train. That's how
they think. That's how they fight.

629
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,910
And then when it comes
to defensive skills,

630
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:57,260
like they might have like an a plus for
an office but their defense might be

631
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:01,670
like a c, you know? And then
when it starts going their
way and they climbed up,

632
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:02,600
they don't know what to do.

633
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:06,620
They have to think instead of just
being instinctive and rolling with stuff

634
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:08,810
cause it's a natural part
of your everyday thing.

635
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,710
That's a weird thing about fighting man.
It's like how much emphasis,

636
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:16,310
especially when it comes to MMA,
how much emphasis to put on striking,

637
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:18,200
how much emphasis to put on grappling,

638
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,640
how much emphasis to put on your cardio
and strength and conditioning and how

639
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:26,180
much to put on skills. And I think that
a huge part of that that's missing.

640
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:28,640
I think in a lot of people or
even just in this conversation,

641
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:31,850
it's like the mental aspect.
You know, you can train perfect.

642
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,800
You could have a decent weight class,

643
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:38,600
you could do everything correctly and
that two hours before the fight from the

644
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,210
time you check in to the time
that you walk out in that ring,

645
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,910
if you're not mentally strong
enough and prepared for that,

646
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,490
you just don't perform. You know what
I mean? And uh, you know, was it,

647
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:52,500
was Anderson Silva that prepared for Nick
to, to lay down and start heckling him?

648
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,540
Most certainly, no, it was, uh, a
lot of the, so I think for me, I, um,

649
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,420
I hired a mind coach, uh, when I first
started with glory and has been a huge,

650
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,600
uh,
it's been a huge change in my career.

651
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,510
And when you see a mind coach
that's interesting that he's like,

652
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:12,430
it's not a like a sports psychologist.
You call it a mind coach. Yeah.

653
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,100
And what do they, what do
they do with you? Oh, he did.
His name's Vinny shoreman.

654
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:19,870
He's out of the UK. Um, he's
actually an announcer for, he's like,

655
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,600
probably one of the most active, uh,
kickboxing announced. He was in the world,

656
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:28,520
used to do k one and it's showtime.
Um, he's been around the kickboxing,

657
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,740
you know, for a long, long
time. Um, he does all kinds
of really cool stuff with me.

658
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:35,180
You know, I didn't want to give away
too many secrets, but he can. Um,

659
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,770
he does like it hypnosis me sometimes

660
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,050
does he live in the UK
and he lives in the UK

661
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,700
and like he'll hypnotize me
through facetime over the phone.

662
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,710
I swear to God it happened. And like
the first time he did it, like I hit it,

663
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,110
he would have been posting and I had
heard it and heard about them a little bit

664
00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:53,260
and I had had some issues in the past
where like my worst performances were not

665
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:57,020
because I didn't train hard, it was
a mental thing, you know, and uh,

666
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,590
uh,

667
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,620
well the first time I started talking to
me like one of the hypnotize me and I'm

668
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:05,620
like, okay, yeah, sure. You didn't have
a thigh as me. And he's like, okay,

669
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,470
I want you to sit down and you know,
you're going to start feeling blah, blah,

670
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:09,910
blah, blah, blah. And as he's talking,

671
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:13,030
I'm like just quietly with my clothes
on with suits, so full of shit,

672
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,880
this is not going to work. This is
not gonna work, this guy. So dumb.

673
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:19,410
And next thing I know, I'm
like, Huh. And uh, you know,

674
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,990
it worked immediately and the things that,

675
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,960
the little things that he told me to do,
I immediately felt a lot better,

676
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,820
like a lot better and I
could see the difference.

677
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:30,580
My coach could see the difference.
And what's his background?

678
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:34,630
Is he a psychologist? Um, I think, I'm not
really sure how he got into that. It's a,

679
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,660
he does like a lot of seminars and
goes to a lot of things and studies,

680
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,190
a lot of stuff.
I don't really know his,

681
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,850
if he went to school for that
or what that is, but he's very,

682
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:43,571
very good at what he does.

683
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:46,720
He works with Liam Harrison and he works
at Jordan wants and he works with Julie

684
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,010
Kitchen.
He worked with Andy Housing.

685
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,330
Most of like the really high
level kickboxers overseas.

686
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,500
That's, that's, that is a very
important point. You know,

687
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:59,250
and I don't know how many guys
utilize a sports psychologist.

688
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:03,060
I know Anderson did a bit for this
fight after the Weidman fights

689
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,700
portant for him going in, stuff like
this. I'm going a lot of guys you like,

690
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:10,220
you bring it up and they
can immediately see it as a,

691
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,420
as a disadvantage that you even think
that you need help or that, you know.

692
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:16,940
But for me,
there's so many things,

693
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,350
like fans don't understand the amount of
pressure that a fighter is under going

694
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:25,220
into a fight and then to go into a fight
where the whole world thinks you're

695
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:27,500
going to lose. You know what I
mean? You have no chance. Like what?

696
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:31,700
Like me fighting Calculi I think I had
nine professional fights and you know,

697
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,830
he knocked out mighty Mo and he was a
Roger Dubliner and champion at over two.

698
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,130
Yeah, we don't, if you
don't know who he is,

699
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,190
he's a world famous Thai boxer
who was about 170 580 pounds,

700
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,080
flop mighty moe who was close to 300
pounds at the time and had kicked him and

701
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:54,510
it was just one of those ridiculous k
one match ups where they used to do in

702
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:55,980
Japan,
they love freak shows.

703
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:01,250
They love to put together no gear versus
Bob Sapp or Bob Saps 375 pounds and you

704
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:05,070
know,
they put a Bob Sapp versus even crazier.

705
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:08,610
They put Bob Sapp versus
Minoa who's like one 85.

706
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,250
So you've got to [inaudible]
pseudo versus a similar,

707
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,730
the Samoan Guy Kinky pseudo also fought,
um,

708
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,750
fucking the fat guy with the ball. A
butter bean. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah.

709
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,090
That show is ridiculous that we're
talking about more than a 200 pound weight

710
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:27,750
disadvantage and they go on the ground
and him on top of you and unbelievable.

711
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:31,250
Unbelievable. Yeah. I mean, but they
don't give a fuck. And Japan, they,

712
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,740
they want to put on Godzilla versus
King Kong. That's what they want to do.

713
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,020
They want to have ridiculous matches

714
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,170
and I want to watch Godzilla versus king
going, you know, I'm into that. You know,

715
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,790
sometimes they see like styles make
fights and like sometimes it's,

716
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,760
I mean obviously you want to see who's
the best of the best of the best,

717
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:47,540
but sometimes you want to see these other,
you know,

718
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,840
these two might not be
even in the top 10 but man,

719
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,810
they're gonna fucking get down. You know,
this is the fight to want to see. Yeah.

720
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,130
I mean look Bob Sapp versus Nogueira to
me still is one of my favorite all time

721
00:38:57,131 --> 00:39:01,210
find it's cause it was so rich. The fact
you got pile drive in the first round,

722
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,550
which you never see in MMA.
It's kind of illegal.

723
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,410
It's illegal in the u s at least speaking
of illegal. Can we talk about this?

724
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,130
Joe? I think we've talked
about this. Sure. What's up
with all these guys smashing,

725
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,230
trying to stomp kick like Anderson did
to nick. You know, I kinda Nice. Yeah.

726
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,670
I just think it's a little shady
that you got to comes off as such a

727
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:20,290
catastrophic injury.

728
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,270
And the first thing he does
is start stomping away at
somebody else's kneecap in

729
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:28,720
a fight. Did you see the, um, the fight
with Miguel Torres, the kickboxing fight,

730
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:32,720
the recent Jamie pulled this up. Um,

731
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,480
Miguel Torres a need destroyed.
You'll,

732
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:42,280
you'll find it. It's legacy. Kickbox
it's a probably Gif. You can find it.

733
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,510
The gif file of it. It's
fucking horrendous. It's the
worst one I've ever seen.

734
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,810
He does this a,

735
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:52,830
the oblique kick and he does it right to
the knee on like the side of his knee.

736
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:57,670
His knee just, you see it get
destroyed. I mean, I just don't,

737
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,310
I just don't think that's, that's,
I don't think it should be illegal.

738
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,920
I just don't think he should be.
And I'm trying to knock somebody out.

739
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,250
I'm not trying to like actually kill
them. Right. And finish their career.

740
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:07,570
But I think if you started messing around,

741
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,910
because I've had two knee surgeries and
had to come back from it, it's just,

742
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,800
it bothers me to see
somebody intentionally tried
to check and knee joint.

743
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,790
But what do you think about
it then? Again, the arm bar.
So what about heal hooks?

744
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,190
Like if you see a guy like who's smart?
Paul Harris,

745
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,110
it was like it's heel hooks specialist.

746
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,180
I don't necessarily have a
problem with the heel hook.

747
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:29,410
I have a problem with a guy that holds
onto the heel hook after you tap multiple

748
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:32,740
times and then intentionally ripped
your leg off and then which he's done,

749
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,070
which really does, you know, I
don't really care for that. Yeah,

750
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:39,100
the helix particularly devastating one.
Hang on to it.

751
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:43,510
Like if you hang onto a choke,
you put the guy out with folks who don't,

752
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,710
who've never trained you, don't like, it's
not that bad to get choked unconscious.

753
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,200
I know it seems like it would be really
bad, but it really is just like a sh.

754
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,200
It shuts your brain off and then
turns your brain back on again.

755
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,810
It's sort of the best way to
describe it is like a garden hose.

756
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,000
You Pinch a garden hose,
it stops the water,

757
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:00,760
and then you let it go and then
the water keeps flowing through it.

758
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:03,640
It's not nearly as bad
as getting knocked out.

759
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,310
So holding onto a choke and
putting the Gar unconscious.

760
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,640
It's really not that big a deal,
but holding onto a heal hook,

761
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:12,880
you tear the ligaments apart and you're
talking about a guy who's going to go

762
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:15,520
through six months of Rehab Surgery,

763
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:18,640
the whole deal and then it might not ever
be the same thing I hear when you were

764
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:23,641
taken away guys livelihood for over
a year most likely just to what be,

765
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,930
you know,
you already got them to tap or whatever.

766
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,250
I just don't particularly go put, highrise
is kind of crazy. There's something,

767
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,000
something does a little bit of a mental,
you

768
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,600
know about his, his childhood, right. His
whole story is really heart wrenching.

769
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,680
I mean he grew up,

770
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,030
he was working full time from the time
he was like a little boy in a, in a farm.

771
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,250
You know that giant scar
that he has on his chest.

772
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,830
He got that when he was working and he
had a crazy glue it together cause like

773
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,640
they had no money for food. They had
no money for the doctor. Like he,

774
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,790
he used to eat pig slop
because he had no food.

775
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,840
Like he would eat like the food that
they would feed pigs. It's a, it's her,

776
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,610
it's horrific. So this guy, like he went
through some really horrendous shit,

777
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,540
like as a child in rural
Brazil, you know, in,

778
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:12,980
in intense poverty.

779
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,090
So I think it's hard to
get through that unscathed.

780
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,750
Most certainly hasn't. So I think
every fight that he has, man,

781
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:23,930
he's fucking fighting for his life.
Right. And if he gets a hold of your leg,

782
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,610
he could see this.
What's that?

783
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,970
It's loading up. Yeah.
Look at this. I mean,

784
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:36,971
he caught it sideways to Miguel was a
heavy on the front leg and he was almost

785
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,550
kinda like stepped in sideways.
Oh,

786
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,350
the dude caught it like just in the
outside. Look at that. Oh my goodness.

787
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,961
Oh,

788
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:50,400
I throw it like a similar kick to that
where I take the front of my foot and I,

789
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,040
it's almost like a slap kick and I
do it to the, the Shinbone, but it's,

790
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,730
it's not too to injure him,
it's to stop his forward momentum.

791
00:42:57,731 --> 00:42:58,720
A lot of times when I do that,

792
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,400
their head comes forward
and I can throw something.

793
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,410
But to go directly in the knee joint,

794
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:04,420
I mean that guy through that
intentionally to do that.

795
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,510
I don't think there's any question that
he was trying to buckle his knee like

796
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:07,870
that.

797
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,440
Yeah, he did attack in the knee and
that's in lookout. Me, he's coming down.

798
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,221
Oh yeah.

799
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:16,180
Well it's actually Miguel was stepping
forward so his knee was off the mat,

800
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,970
like as it landed. See that?
Oh, it was kind of touching,

801
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,990
but he was coming forward
and the guy caught, yeah,

802
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:27,310
see his need came up and he's coming
forward and then it just went down on it

803
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:31,540
and just wrenched it across. Oh,
it's a horrible to watch. Ooh.

804
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,670
And that's, you're out for a year and
it might not have it be the same again.

805
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:39,100
If you come back. There are
two in this new thing now, man,

806
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:43,480
where they're three d mapping. Um,
your meniscus, they're taking this, uh,

807
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,940
this thing that they've created. It's
like a scaffolding. They three d map,

808
00:43:48,941 --> 00:43:51,640
this scaffolding,
the insert it where your meniscus is.

809
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:56,530
And it has proteins in your body,
builds your own meniscus on it.

810
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:56,951
That's all.

811
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:59,810
So you're going to be able to rebuild
your municipal awesome cause you're

812
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:02,230
credible for years. That's been the
thing they can, they can't change.

813
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,450
If you tear your meniscus
like you're screwed.

814
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,830
That's really good that they can do
that. Well, they've Cartlidge too.

815
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,030
They've started to do
that with stem cells.

816
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,390
They've started to inject stem cells
into the area where people are missing

817
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:17,140
cartilage and cars, cartilage regrown
which is incredible. Yeah. That's awesome.

818
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,830
Yeah. They're doing PRP
stuff to where the, uh,

819
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,200
when we were with my knee
surgeries, they were, uh,

820
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,910
thinking about doing that with mine.

821
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,620
They didn't do a platelet
rich plasma is really cool.

822
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:31,090
And there's another thing that I've been
doing called Regena keen and Regena.

823
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,190
Amazing.
It's

824
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,110
the, that's the stuff that was invented
by this guy. I'm a doc, I forget his name,

825
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:41,640
but he's in, um, uh, in Germany
and he created this, uh,

826
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,420
procedure. We take the blood, they
pull it out like a lot of blood,

827
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:50,010
and then they spin it in a centrifuge
and heat it up. And when they heat it up,

828
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,290
it takes,
um,

829
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,040
the blood and the blood reacts to the
heat is if you have a fever and it creates

830
00:44:56,041 --> 00:45:00,420
this amazing anti-inflammatory response.
This is yellow serum.

831
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,620
They pulled his yellow Sierra mountain
and they inject it directly into any area

832
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:07,140
where you have an injury and it's like,

833
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,330
like platelet rich plasma times a hundred.
It's so amazing. That makes sense.

834
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:15,450
It's like a, like the cold laser therapy
where they're like light therapy.

835
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:20,250
That's what they do. It means a lot. Yeah.
But therapists, you're essentially the,

836
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,230
the light or the heat,
uh,

837
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,620
triggers your body to send more blood
and nutrients and heal itself straight.

838
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,200
Keeping that stuff up and
injecting it back in, you
know? Yeah. It's amazing, man.

839
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:35,010
It's amazing science. I've had it done in
a bar I've had done on my knee, my neck,

840
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:38,560
my back, my elbow, my shoulder.
It's incredible. I've,

841
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,680
every time some shit's fucked up on me,

842
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:42,360
I just go right down
there and get shot up.

843
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:45,750
That you feel the difference right away?
Oh yeah. Man, my knee was fucking with me.

844
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:45,990
I,

845
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:50,400
I've had three knee surgeries and my knee
was fucking with me for like the last

846
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:50,821
couple of years. I was like, man,

847
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:54,840
I'm going to have to get this fucking
thing scoped again and I get it shot up

848
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:59,640
like five months ago. Nothing,
squats, kickboxing, nothing.

849
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:03,720
Just never fucked with me
anymore. It's weird. It's amazing.

850
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:06,810
So they can do incredible shit
now with medicine and science.

851
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:10,260
Thank God there's so many egg heads out
there that are just fucking pounding on

852
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:11,780
the keyboards and you know,

853
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,420
doing it in the lab and trying to
reengineer human beings. It's amazing.

854
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:20,421
It's like what Anderson and the and
Tyrone Spong that break like 15 years ago,

855
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:22,770
they would have like amputated your leg.
Like it would have just been,

856
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,620
that would have been that really me.
Yeah.

857
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,760
Somebody was telling me that
they used to amputate leg

858
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:32,490
if the leg snapped and like the, yeah,
they were, they said they would amputate.

859
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,370
But yeah, because of the, the something
about the tissue or something.

860
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,520
Just 15 years ago, something like
that. Yeah. That's hard to believe,

861
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:43,020
but don't quote me on that.
But yeah, that's what I heard.

862
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,830
Somebody might align with some bright
light to me. I'm pretty gullible. Well,

863
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:49,090
they probably used to have
to like Joe my line to us.

864
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:53,500
All right now by this gold stuff there,
the re-injecting, I don't know man. I've,

865
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,550
that stuff's a Dana white is the
one who told me about it. He, uh,

866
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,350
he had it done for his ministers disease.

867
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,730
He disease is something you have
in the inner ear and it would,

868
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,940
it was fucking with him his whole life.
He had surgery to try to fix it and he,

869
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:10,140
uh, he got shot up with this, uh,
the Regena Canon just bang, gone,

870
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,240
just goes away.
I wonder if that would have helped nick.

871
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:14,820
Nick a herd is a left elbow.

872
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,390
Hyperextended his left elbow and we were
training like maybe three or four weeks

873
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,830
before the fight and uh,

874
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,060
it really started messing with them
like the week before the fight. And, uh,

875
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:29,690
we were in Vegas and as manager actually
hit called Dana to find out what doctor

876
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:34,930
or whatever to go to, to get him a
cortisone shot into his elbow. And, uh,

877
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,290
like you wouldn't mean nick won't
even take Ibuprofen. I was like, dude,

878
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:42,370
take some Ibuprofen. He uh,
I think it was about, um,

879
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,280
when he used to cut really
easily back in the day,

880
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:49,450
I'll be proven is like a blood thinner
sorta thing or something that he makes

881
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:53,520
him bleed more or whatnot. But um,
yeah, he was having like he would,

882
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:56,590
we were walking around the hotel and like
if his arm would lock out and like he

883
00:47:56,591 --> 00:48:00,490
would have to wait a second for it to
like click back. So it was TCIS Christ.

884
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,050
Yeah. Then you're going into a
fight where you're boxing is your,

885
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,950
your strong suit and you don't feel really
comfortable throwing your left hand.

886
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:10,600
So that's ridiculous. But yeah, I wonder
if that gold stuff for the helped.

887
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,010
Yeah,
but you got through it.

888
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,900
I mean he landed some good shots with
it so he definitely did well once I had

889
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:18,070
adrenaline starts flowing. Yeah,
that's what I was telling him.

890
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,530
Like you're not going to think about that
when, when you're out there. You know,

891
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,740
the Regena keen thing is all the rage,
like all the basketball players to Coby.

892
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,910
Brian gets it done.
All these different guys get it done.

893
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,920
Guys were flying over to Germany to do it,

894
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,670
but now they have an office in Santa
Monica and I think they have an office in

895
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,620
Dallas I think as well.

896
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,410
They have a couple of them that they're
opening up I think might be opening up

897
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:39,041
one in Vegas,

898
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,490
but they're opening up all over the
country because the response is amazing.

899
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,320
That's nuts. Yeah. We live in a weird
time. Science is amazing. It really is.

900
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,770
I just got done today. I was doing
cryotherapy if you'd done that yet.

901
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:52,430
I haven't done it.
I wanted to go to one,

902
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,120
especially after the last man standing
tournament. My entire body was messed up.

903
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:59,570
I had this, uh, it's still kind of
messes with me a little bit now.

904
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,720
But somehow along the line of
the three nights, three fights,

905
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,310
I got hit in the chest with something.

906
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,820
I want to say it was probably Simon
with one of those knees. But, uh,

907
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:11,630
my whole body hurt. And
then as the swelling and
everything started going down,

908
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:15,320
my fucking chest just started
killing your sternum and it was like,

909
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,390
then I noticed I had like this ball,

910
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:20,880
it was literally like a size
of like a tennis ball on,

911
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,760
on my chest is still square
is up a little bit now.

912
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,590
But it swelled up so much that it pinched
off all the nerves in my chest and my

913
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:32,210
arm would like, I'd have like a stingers
all the way down my arm and I'd wake up,

914
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:35,330
I mean for the first like
week or two after the fight,

915
00:49:35,331 --> 00:49:37,490
I was like waking up in the
middle of the night, like shaking.

916
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:41,270
I would get a fever cause it wasn't so
much pain from the scenario stuff. And uh,

917
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,990
I guess I got like multiple X-rays,
thought my sternum was broken,

918
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:45,771
couldn't figure it out,

919
00:49:45,771 --> 00:49:50,170
wasn't there was no break and they said it
was basically like, uh, you know, these,

920
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,520
you see these guys when they get hit in
the face or hit in the head and they get

921
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:57,050
these hematomas on their head and it's
just blood and crap that's stuck between

922
00:49:57,051 --> 00:49:58,970
the skin. And the bone, what mine was,

923
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:02,730
I guess inside of the cartilage of
my rib or whatever. And you know,

924
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,870
even for the moment by when I would be
training Jiu Jitsu or it'd be working on

925
00:50:05,871 --> 00:50:08,030
my chokes or somebody puts
their weight on my chest,

926
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:09,950
like it would swell up afterwards.

927
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:13,790
So I was taking Ibuprofen by like
the handful of there for a minute.

928
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,930
But it's doing a lot better now.

929
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,580
Yeah, the, the crown therapy would
probably helped out a little bit,

930
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,740
but I think that's just one of those
things it's going to yield to the crowd.

931
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:24,850
Therapy is awesome for recovery. Yeah,
it's amazing. I do ice baths. I mean,

932
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,980
I think the cryotherapy so much
shorter, it like a lot cooler, a

933
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,671
lot shorter,

934
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:32,390
and apparently a lot more
effective because you're
going 250 degrees below zero

935
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:35,420
for three minutes. Then you get out,
you get on an elliptical machine,

936
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:37,160
you warm your body back up and then boom,

937
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,010
right back in for another three
minutes. What's that feeling, dude?

938
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,420
It feels amazing.
You get out of there,

939
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:45,080
you feel like you could fucking
jump over the moon. It's amazing.

940
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,550
There's such a Wa it's wild. Like if
you could take that in a pill form,

941
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:53,300
people would just be fucking chewing
on him all day because most people are

942
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:58,160
scared of the feeling like fucking 253
it's really not that bad. It's really not.

943
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,950
It just kind of stand there. I mean,
I'm not, I don't even freak out.

944
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:02,900
It just kind of move around a little.
It hurts my nipples.

945
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,600
So I covered my nipples up when I do it.
I don't know why.

946
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,390
I don't want my nipples to fall off.
Not that I use them or anything.

947
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,430
They're pretty numb anyway, but they, uh,

948
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,610
that's the only thing that starts to like,
feel like really bad.

949
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,870
You'd legs get super cold towards the end,
but it's just three minutes, you know,

950
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:21,040
he's just kinda deal with it for three
minutes and then he'd get out and you,

951
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,180
as soon as you get out, you're like, Woo.

952
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,380
As soon as your body realizes it's back
in room temperature. Well the blood,

953
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:30,630
apparently the science behind it
is that your body real thanks.

954
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,830
This motherfucker's gonna
die. Okay. You just,

955
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,810
somebody just dropped you off at the
top of the world and it's a zero degrees

956
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,850
below zero and you fucking you,
you're going to die within moments.

957
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,180
So your body's all the blood
to your or to your organs,

958
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,390
try to protect your organs and then
once you get back to room temperature,

959
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:49,660
it pushes it all out and it creates
this amazing anti-inflammatory effect,

960
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:51,890
like all the soreness
that you have and just,

961
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:56,780
it just does a weird thing to your body.
But the energy that you get out of it,

962
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,990
I dunno, I dunno if it's an adrenaline
rush of your body, realizes like, hey,

963
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:04,410
we're not going to die. Life is beautiful.
Look, the sun is shining. I'm alive.

964
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:05,151
You know,

965
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:08,720
it's like when those things where they
say you don't really appreciate piece

966
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:12,090
unless you've experienced war, you don't
appreciate love unless the experience,

967
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,920
hey,

968
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,430
you don't know how beautiful it is to
be able to walk down the street and not

969
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:19,250
freeze your Dick off until you're
in tied one of those booze.

970
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,120
But there's a lot of physical effects.
We can try that. That sounds really cool.

971
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,340
You can research it online,
like all the different,

972
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,380
the like what they know about the actual
biochemical effect that it has on your

973
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:33,950
body. But people swear by it. Like,
again, like basketball players,

974
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:37,120
MMA fighters like Allen,
Joe Ban, uh, who's a,

975
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,410
one of our guys at 10th Plan
and he's in there every day.

976
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,890
Eddie Bravo does it every day.
It's just,

977
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,660
it's amazing when he was training
for the boiler fight too, especially,

978
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,480
he was in there every day. It's
just, it's amazing. It just,

979
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,800
it just makes you recover quicker.
But the feeling you get out of it.

980
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,730
I love the best. I will walk out of there.
It's like your whole body feels alive.

981
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,790
It's wild. Yeah. He wouldn't,
you come back, let me know. I'll,

982
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,810
I'll take you down there. Yeah, definitely
introduce you to those guys. Cool.

983
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:05,280
Science actually with, um,
with like cold therapy, uh,

984
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,540
after the last men standing tournament.
I was thinking about doing it.

985
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,630
I just didn't, I didn't, I don't
know why I didn't end up doing it,

986
00:53:10,631 --> 00:53:14,900
but Nike makes a cooling vest that uh,
it's basically like the,

987
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:19,570
as all of these pockets or are we
out of his pockets in it and uh,

988
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,140
it keeps you like really cool.

989
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,920
So I was thinking after the fight of
putting that on because I found out that

990
00:53:23,921 --> 00:53:27,390
like 70%, again, don't
quote me on these numbers,

991
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:32,391
but 75% of the your your energy system
misspent on temperature regulation.

992
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,860
So like if you had to have multiple
fights in one night, you know,

993
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,260
how much time are you wasting sitting
in the back sweating and the you're

994
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:42,390
wasting energy that you
need later on in the fights.

995
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:45,680
We were thinking about trying
to put, um, to use that,

996
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,290
that cold pack or were
those a cooling vest?

997
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,700
I think Nike came out with
it for the Beijing Olympics.

998
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,370
That's a great idea. You have two fights
this weekend? No, I just have one.

999
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,950
Which honestly it seems like,
you know, my coaches, I was like,

1000
00:53:57,951 --> 00:54:00,290
Holly and my cardio is not quite as
good as I thought it was. And he's like,

1001
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:02,240
you only get a fight once. I
was like, oh, all right. Yeah.

1002
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,960
It's hard to compare because
when you get and such,

1003
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,800
I mean I was in phenomenal shape for that,
for that last men standing tournament.

1004
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,663
I think I had like,

1005
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,600
we found out about that fight I think
four or five months in advance and it was

1006
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:16,680
going pretty hard for it the whole time.
And uh,

1007
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,690
now when you have a camp like that, like
who, who like who structures you can't,

1008
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,810
but who structures like
how much running you do,

1009
00:54:23,811 --> 00:54:26,390
how much strength and conditioning you do,
how much kickboxing,

1010
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:29,750
how much striking with on the
pads, how many, like how do you,

1011
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,060
how do you structure your
workouts? Um, my coach,

1012
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,230
we'll do that, but um, have the,
for that camp it was like, okay.

1013
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,380
Cause we had just came back from the
Wayne Barrett fight where he just seemed

1014
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:41,480
like a lot bigger than me.
So it was like, you know,

1015
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,990
I was fighting at one 75
before I signed with glory.

1016
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,070
And then when I went to the Gloria,

1017
00:54:46,071 --> 00:54:50,950
it was automatically up to like one 87
and [inaudible] 86. And uh, you know,

1018
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,410
the glory tinned tournament arts and 11
wasn't very big guy in English and music

1019
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:57,050
worked out really well for me, so I
thought I was good at that, at that size.

1020
00:54:57,051 --> 00:55:00,890
And then with Wayne Barrett, he was just
so massive. Like he's just a big guy,

1021
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:03,500
you know, and uh, so I
wanted to put on some muscle.

1022
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:08,180
So we did a lot of strength conditioning.
Just I was doing like, uh, every day,

1023
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,040
sometimes twice a day I was doing,

1024
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:14,540
I'm going to La fitness with my
buddy and doing like a body strictly

1025
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:18,520
bodybuilding stuff, no
cardio, just uh, I was taking,

1026
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,550
I think he was shooting for like
3,500 calories a day, which is just,

1027
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:26,780
I would feel lethargic and
just exhausted all the time.

1028
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,190
And I did that for a few for a few months.
I think I got up to about two 15,

1029
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:34,220
which was really big for me at the time.
And then the last,

1030
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,120
I think it was probably
the last like five weeks,

1031
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:41,630
I stopped with the strength conditioning
was just focused on speed and trying to

1032
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:45,590
get, trying to get used to that size that
I was and I trimmed down quite a bit,

1033
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:46,340
but um,

1034
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,900
it was like build the muscle bulk up
and then get fast and loose and then go

1035
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:53,840
into the tournament and then my cardio
and my speed and everything kind of comes

1036
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:54,830
in the last four weeks.

1037
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,230
Yeah. Some guy, there's a lot of
guys who like to do that for MMA.

1038
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:02,670
Like they take off from a fight and then
once they're done they get out of camp

1039
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,550
before they saved. They know they
have a five, four or five months away.

1040
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,420
They'll do nothing but
strength and conditioning, no
fight training, no sparring,

1041
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,340
you know, know getting hit, no grappling.

1042
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:15,780
They just lifting weights and just like
jumping boxes and doing all kinds of

1043
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:17,160
pliers and shit like that.

1044
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,470
That was the first time
I'd ever done that,

1045
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,350
that I really focused on the
strength and conditioning stuff.

1046
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:24,570
And then when I did start,
um,

1047
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,990
when I stopped with that and I
started doing the runs and stuff, uh,

1048
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:32,290
nick was actually in town and we
went for a long run at Venice beach.

1049
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,790
I think we were at
Ronda as house that day.

1050
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,180
And we went for like this long run and
we did like six mile run and I felt

1051
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:39,250
really good. And then
I was like, hey, let's,

1052
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,250
let's hit these sprints on the way
back and there's like bathroom,

1053
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:45,010
and then it's like 200 yards, even another
bathroom or whatever. And he's like,

1054
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:49,870
okay, we'll run to that, to that next. Uh,
the next bathroom we'll split. And like,

1055
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:53,110
I couldn't, I was just in shocked
at how many gears I had. I was like,

1056
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,710
I'd never ran that fast ever in my
whole life. And it was, we had really,

1057
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,360
it was the difference of that time that
I had booked up and really worked on the

1058
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:05,590
strength conditioning and then the
period of, of cutting down and getting,

1059
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:08,470
leaning, getting fast again. And I was
just very, very explosive. And it was,

1060
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,700
it was really good sign.
I smoked Nikkia you listen to this,

1061
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:16,660
Nick beat you. That's, that's interesting.

1062
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:20,300
So this is like that's a direct result
of all the weightlifting and all the put

1063
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,760
on muscle and strength.

1064
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,640
That was the first time I really noticed
a big difference cause I always really

1065
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:28,000
hit hard. I mean I think I've always
hit really hard. Um, but that was,

1066
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:31,940
that was something I really noticed was
my, my explosiveness out of my legs was,

1067
00:57:31,941 --> 00:57:33,160
it was definitely a lot better.

1068
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,230
It's weird that for fighters it seems
like every training camp is almost like a

1069
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:39,130
science project.

1070
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,750
What you're trying to figure out what is
the right mixture and also back to the

1071
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:47,350
mental thing. I think that that's
um, you know, I always say like,

1072
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:50,530
I'm trying to get like the tip of like an
Arrow, you know what I mean? Each fight,

1073
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:53,380
I get it kind of closer to
that and then you know, you,

1074
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,750
you make a mistake or whatever.

1075
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,090
I'm trying to get to the pinnacle
of like mentally focused,

1076
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:01,810
you know what I'm saying? The perfect,
perfect, perfect, perfect edge.

1077
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,440
Do I get too pumped up before I,
if I was at too cold, was I flat?

1078
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:08,290
Was I thinking about the right things?
And you know,

1079
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:11,950
that's what my mind coach really helps
me is there's so many things going on in

1080
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:14,910
my head and he just tells me the
right things to think. And you know,

1081
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,990
a lot of it is also like the way you,

1082
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,350
the way you talk to yourself or about
yourself, the way you describe yourself.

1083
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,260
You know, I used to say
stuff like, uh, you know,

1084
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:27,040
I have really good punches
but my kids aren't that good.
And he told me like, Hey,

1085
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:28,810
you got to stop saying
that stuff. I'm like, well,

1086
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:32,930
my kicks were there aren't that
good and well, you kind of self, uh,

1087
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,950
self sabotage yourself. You, you only
allow yourself to get as good as you,

1088
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:41,860
you talk about yourself. That makes sense
at all. Uh, define you. Define Yourself.

1089
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,610
That's why I call it like mint, like mind
coaching instead of like psychological,

1090
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,750
you know, psychologist or whatever.
It's just like my coach tells me, Hey,

1091
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:51,970
you're dropping your hands or
you're doing this or doing that,

1092
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,800
or you need to focus on this,
this and this.

1093
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,630
My mind coach is doing the same thing.
And I think that like the, I don't know,

1094
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:03,430
I think everything is really
come, um, the stars, so to speak,

1095
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:06,370
of all kind of aligned for me in the
last, last couple of years. You know,

1096
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,060
I feel like I'm, I'm at an
age now, I'm just turning 31,

1097
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,420
although I guess I can't
change my Wikipedia page now.

1098
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,780
Why was it say it says I'm 31 I
was going to change it to like 26.

1099
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:22,010
I don't do it. It's a slippery
slope. I know guys that are

1100
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,190
40 something they'd tried
to stay there 30. Yeah, it's
fucking ridiculous. I think,

1101
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:29,620
you know, I've reached an age
and my career where I just, uh,

1102
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,500
I'm a lot more mature. I'm a
lot better athlete, you know,

1103
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,160
it seems like everything's
kind of lining up now.

1104
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:35,870
And I have the right coaches behind me.

1105
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,400
I built with my coach Mark
Comoros and so I was a,

1106
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,020
so it was fighting an amateur fights,
you know,

1107
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,250
he's taken me throughout my whole career,
so that's great.

1108
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,850
Well that's a guy who knows you really
well done. The Yard in ll where?

1109
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:50,810
Where's the yard? Uh, it's in Lincoln
Heights, right? Announced right outside.

1110
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:54,570
It's on the Avenue 26. It's right where
the five and the one team, one 10 meat.

1111
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,860
So it was like downtown area. That's
basically downtown. Is it? Oh,

1112
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,360
that's a bitch to get to it.
It the fucking traffic's a,

1113
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,460
I kind of live in that general area.
Like I live in Alhambra,

1114
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,710
like South Pasadena area,
so it's not too bad for me.

1115
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,980
I was living in downtown for
a long time and then my, uh,

1116
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,540
my son started going to schools
and I was like, you know,

1117
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:15,190
I'd rather have him in a little
bit of a school system. So yeah,

1118
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,020
the best school system we could,
you know,

1119
01:00:17,021 --> 01:00:21,140
the best school system I think is like
a orange county, but we couldn't quite,

1120
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:24,170
didn't quite work out for the best
one we could find was Alhambra,

1121
01:00:24,171 --> 01:00:27,980
which is like South Pasadena
is really nice quiet area man.

1122
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,180
I love it there.

1123
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:33,380
Pasadena was like apparently back in
the day when Hollywood was sorta first

1124
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,290
created in the 20s or whatever,
the uh,

1125
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:40,700
the stars would fucking booze it up and
do blow in the Hollywood hills and the

1126
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:42,740
producers are like,
let me get the fuck Outta here.

1127
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,730
And then they set up shop in Pasadena.
That's why she didn't go by Pasadena.

1128
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,150
There's these giant estate to house man.

1129
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:55,040
Got Some amazing houses in Pasadena. I
fucking love Pasadena. Yeah, it's nice.

1130
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:58,750
There's some, there's a gem. Isn't
there like a sit you'll tongue,

1131
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,680
you're talking as a Pasadena?
Yeah.

1132
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,500
It's got a kickboxing gym isn't around
for a long time. We tie. Yeah. Yeah.

1133
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:08,600
La is a weird spot where you would think
there'd be a lot more like top level

1134
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:12,680
MMA gyms in this area when there
are, yeah. There really is a,

1135
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,340
you know, there wasn't a whole lot
it's written like in Hollywood,

1136
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:19,560
it was like legends. It was like the
only MMA gym for a long, long time. Yeah.

1137
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,540
And uh, yeah, who legends
went under and then you know,

1138
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:26,510
you've got some stuff down in Orange
County. Of course you've got rain,

1139
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:29,740
you've got kings, but yeah, Timo Yama.

1140
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:32,720
But there's no like Jackson's MMA,

1141
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:37,250
he got like world champions training
in one facility that's like this center

1142
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:39,920
spot. It's almost seems
like for a lot of places,

1143
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:44,600
like it might actually be better to be
in a small town and bring the guys in and

1144
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:47,750
then of course you're going to have less
distractions and less bullshit if that

1145
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:51,410
happens. Right. But la doesn't have
a lot of great kickboxing either.

1146
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,290
There's not a lot of different
spots for as many peoples.

1147
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:57,500
There are 20 million people. Yeah.
When I moved out here from Ohio,

1148
01:01:57,501 --> 01:02:00,300
it was to pursue kickboxing.
It was because uh,

1149
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:05,420
Los Angeles and California
was the like, uh, the,

1150
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,900
uh, center for kickboxing in
this country, you know. Um,

1151
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,660
it was the only show that
only played with him.

1152
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,890
But I was moved out here when I was 19.
Um,

1153
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,020
they were the only ones putting on a
sanctioned Muay Thai fights was Dennis

1154
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,100
Warner and vote vote promotions.
And

1155
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,130
uh, but there's a really good
gyms in, um, in Van Nuys there's,

1156
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,970
there's a really good gym and um,
north Hollywood,

1157
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:31,740
two or three in north Hollywood, there's
a Santa Clarita has got really good gym.

1158
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:33,540
So, you know, I think that, um,

1159
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:38,130
there's a lot of of Moyie Thai here in
southern California and I think that's,

1160
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,510
you know, when I was fighting it and
amateurs and smokers and, and um,

1161
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,380
the smaller shows here in California,
it was,

1162
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,660
it was the amateur was a very high level,
you know, very high level. And, uh,

1163
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,740
I only had, I had, uh,

1164
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,340
I was 23 and one is an amateur and

1165
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,670
most of those were smokers,
just local amateur fights before Wipro.

1166
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:05,190
So many Jujitsu schools here. That's
what reduction Jesse's, it's crazy here.

1167
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:06,030
Right?
It's amazing.

1168
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:08,770
When you compare Jujitsu to all the
other martial arts is may be like,

1169
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,580
it's almost like 10 to one is like how
many Jujitsu gems and then world class,

1170
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:18,000
you know Hickson's here, crones here,
John Joc Machado's got to gyms here.

1171
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:20,910
He gets got a gym here.
It's like on and on and on.

1172
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:24,390
You can keep going over and over and
over this so many fucking worldclass

1173
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:26,490
Jujitsu schools here because Brazilians,

1174
01:03:26,491 --> 01:03:28,820
they like the song and they want to
be near the beach. You know, it's like

1175
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,090
this is the spot that gravitate to this.
Agree with them.

1176
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:37,050
It's amazing how much that's
changed in this country. You know,

1177
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:40,830
when I first started training
in [inaudible] 96 there
was a small handful of

1178
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:42,000
black belts in the country.

1179
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,180
There was just not that many
like worldclass places to train.

1180
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,370
Now they're everywhere.
Every city you go to,

1181
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:50,940
there's a legit black belt that's
teaching classes and you know,

1182
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:52,420
there's places that have hens.

1183
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,930
I was kind of like 500 plus
students in New York City.

1184
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:58,950
You know that in New York City's
another hotbed. It's like, you know,

1185
01:03:58,951 --> 01:04:02,400
there's Hendo and Marcello Garcia
and you know, on and on and on,

1186
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:04,500
you can just keep going.
There's just so many gems there.

1187
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:10,310
But when it comes to a place where you
have like a legit worldclass MMA training

1188
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:17,850
facility, like an Aka, you know, there's
still not that many of them. Right.

1189
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:21,480
You know, and especially when you look
at California, you would think, man,

1190
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:26,190
you know, this is like so much
kickboxing, so much Jujitsu, so much MMA,

1191
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:30,720
like you know, are so much, uh, you
know, so many fighters but not like one,

1192
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:32,610
like it's a big central spot.

1193
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,490
And then the ones that it's like,
it must like, you like team Timo,

1194
01:04:36,491 --> 01:04:40,380
you has got like Ian and,
and most of their, their team
has, I was a lot smaller,

1195
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:41,221
you know what I mean?

1196
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:44,790
I was going there for a long time and
he's trained with Shane del Rosario, um,

1197
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,700
before he passed away.
And, uh, after he was gone,

1198
01:04:47,701 --> 01:04:49,650
there wasn't a whole lot
of guys my size down there.

1199
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:53,610
So that's an issue for bigger guys to
write big, especially for heavyweights.

1200
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,910
It's really hard for heavyweights to
find good training partners and find a

1201
01:04:56,911 --> 01:05:01,710
skillful guy that's above 225 pounds.
It's just, it's not that many.

1202
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,730
Right. I think alliance has got a
good, it's a good team. Dumb Go. Right.

1203
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,130
They're pretty good guys. They
got some good guys, you know,

1204
01:05:08,131 --> 01:05:12,810
of course a Aka has called me
a and a and cane. There's a,

1205
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:15,350
there's some good guys there. I called
him and doing really well. It leads to,

1206
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:18,980
yeah, yeah. Rock holds
a beast. Yeah. This, uh,

1207
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:22,990
this is an interesting time because people
are still trying to figure out how to

1208
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:25,210
train correctly for MMA.
You know,

1209
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:29,710
it's like you've got a lot of guys that
are still holdovers from the early days

1210
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:33,580
where they would get together and
try to figure it out and slug it out.

1211
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:38,580
And there was a lot of like unnecessarily
hard sparring or unless they're a hard

1212
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:42,700
not smart sparring and then,
you know,

1213
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:45,640
people were still trying to figure out
like what's the best way to go about it.

1214
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,320
And then you have people
that have figured it out,

1215
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:51,490
like the Aka sort of figured it out or
the American top teams where they have it

1216
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:54,910
down to a science, you know,
but there's just not that many.

1217
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,780
Whereas like if you look at any other
major sport, look at baseball or football,

1218
01:05:58,781 --> 01:06:01,330
like they have protocols like
strength and conditioning protocols.

1219
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:04,690
We put all their athletes through and
there's been programs cause they'd go

1220
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:08,230
through from high school to
college to the pros. Like they,

1221
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,440
they know like state of the art.
This is what we're supposed to do.

1222
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,970
This is the best way to recover.

1223
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:15,430
This is the best way to start to
train strength and conditioning.

1224
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:19,990
This is the best way to do this with
MMA also, there's so many skills,

1225
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,090
there's so many things to learn.
It's like,

1226
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,550
it's one of the most
interesting things about MMA,

1227
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,550
but it's also one of the things like,
man, what do you concentrate on?

1228
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,800
Uh, that's a really good point. You know,

1229
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:33,110
with me transitioning over to
them and May, it's, it's, uh,

1230
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,420
it's one thing I'm really enjoying
is there's so much, you know,

1231
01:06:35,421 --> 01:06:37,910
never done kickboxing for so long where,
you know,

1232
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,610
I don't know everything there
is to know about kickboxing,

1233
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,000
but I feel very at home and if I get
in good shape and my coaches are just

1234
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,500
sharpening me of, uh, keeping me fresh,

1235
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:50,030
I think I can get it in a kickboxing fight
and, uh, just react naturally, you know?

1236
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:51,320
And with him it may,
it's still,

1237
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:54,170
I'm still learning and
still thinking about things.

1238
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:58,040
And a lot of times I remember what I was
supposed to do, like 10 seconds after,

1239
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,530
you know, I got tapped out, I should've
done this or did that, you know, so,

1240
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:04,950
but it's a lot of fun to,
uh, to be evolving and keep
learning new things for me,

1241
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:05,200
you know,

1242
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,270
and there's so much stuff to learn and
so many different styles and different

1243
01:07:08,271 --> 01:07:08,991
ways to win.

1244
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:13,520
And that's when really beneficial for
me working with nick and Nate as they

1245
01:07:13,521 --> 01:07:17,850
think about it. So, so analytically,
you know, like, Oh, you know,

1246
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,870
going on top, going on bottle, I'm
like, if this doesn't work out,

1247
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,630
then you're ended up here. And you
know, it's uh, it's really interesting.

1248
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,490
D is it difficult cause you're doing both?

1249
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,200
He just fought Melvin Manhoef in a big
a MMA fight in Bellator and then you go

1250
01:07:31,201 --> 01:07:34,470
on from that and a couple months later
you're finding in a big kickboxing event.

1251
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,160
Is it difficult to do both at the
same time? I'm, I'm going to find out,

1252
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:43,170
you know, uh, I right now it's,
it's, uh, I'm living the dream.

1253
01:07:43,171 --> 01:07:46,710
I feel like I can be really successful
in both right now depending on the,

1254
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:49,690
the right match ups, you know,
I don't think, um, you know,

1255
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:55,170
I don't think I'm going to a contender
for a title in MMA just yet. Um, but, uh,

1256
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:59,670
yeah, it's uh, you know, there's things
I have to remember not to do, uh,

1257
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,300
for both. You know what I mean? If I
knock somebody down in new and May,

1258
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:07,080
I don't walk away and write eight count.
Mark Hunt,

1259
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,230
he's the king of the walkaway Kao in MMA.

1260
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,280
It was funny when I knocked
out with Melvin, um,

1261
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:16,580
I felt the walkaway like I needed to
do though I knew it was out, but, um,

1262
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:21,230
my coaches and my coach and my manager
were very adamant that that the night of

1263
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:24,890
the fight and then like the week of that,
like this isn't, this isn't kickboxing,

1264
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:27,900
there isn't going to be an eight count.
If you drop him, make sure you go over my,

1265
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:30,170
finish him, you know, like
you need to finish right away.

1266
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,830
And so like I hit him with like the hook
cross w I didn't even know I hit him

1267
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:35,250
with the left hand.
I thought he,

1268
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:38,220
I thought it was just the right
hand until I saw the video. And, uh,

1269
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,320
I saw him go down and you know,

1270
01:08:40,321 --> 01:08:43,600
he's going down with his hands up and I'm
like one of to walk away and then like,

1271
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:46,490
there's like this voice in
my head, like, oh, finish
golfing. And yet, and I went to,

1272
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,530
went to go in and uh,
uh,

1273
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,350
Mike Belcher had jumped in the
way and then I was just like, ugh,

1274
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:56,730
totally ruined my walk up
and just walked off. Right.

1275
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:01,460
Yeah. Pull that up. Jimmy Joe
Schilling. Kaos Melvin Manhoef.

1276
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,900
That was a big fight for you because
there's been that that Guy Melvin Manhoef,

1277
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:09,440
his um,
his style is terrifying.

1278
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:13,340
Like people are terrified of that guy
because first of all, he's black as coal.

1279
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,050
He looks like a fucking superhero.
He comes out throwing bombs,

1280
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:20,390
knocked out, Mark Hunt
with one punch. I mean,

1281
01:09:20,391 --> 01:09:24,440
he's a terrifying and it's
strikes like 12 minutes long.

1282
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,860
Everybody.
Like the week of the fight,

1283
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:29,580
everyone's like Joe Shillings fighting
this guy and they tag me in it.

1284
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,080
Like every time I checked
Facebook or Instagram or Twitter,

1285
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:35,320
it was like people reminding me that
I'm fighting, you know, this guy.

1286
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:37,580
And it was just like knockout,
knockout, knockout. You know,

1287
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:40,480
he's got the highlight reel
of death. Yeah, he's a,

1288
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,390
it was a really big fight for me.
It was a really tough fight from me to,

1289
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:46,960
you know, I had a, it was a really bad
camp. It was probably the worst camp.

1290
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,250
My career, my dad had passed away
like three weeks before the fight.

1291
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:55,060
Then like two or three days after that.
Why does that look so shitty, Jamie?

1292
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,830
My cousin passed away so it was

1293
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,770
pull it back.
So is it our computer that's doing that?

1294
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:04,360
It's drags cause the computer. Why is
it, but come on man. This is fucking,

1295
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:08,950
it's a youtube video. Is it really that
bad? What do we got to do to fix that?

1296
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,010
Tell him whatever we have to do to
fix that. Let's fucking fix that.

1297
01:10:12,011 --> 01:10:15,610
Cause this is pissing me off. This
looks like shit. Can't even see it.

1298
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,780
Boom.
Damn.

1299
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:24,340
There's that dude's been flatlined a
bunch of times over the last few years.

1300
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:29,500
It's a those Dutch guys.
A lot of fucking tough guys in Holland.

1301
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,920
Man. Lot of tough kickboxers
in Holland. It's like,

1302
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,320
I think of them almost like a kamikaze
fighter. It's either like can be killed,

1303
01:10:35,321 --> 01:10:38,980
but that's why I'm a fan of it. You know?
Who doesn't want to watch a moment, man.

1304
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:43,900
I'll fuck. Yeah, no, I'm a huge fan.
Mike's gym producing some goddamn savages.

1305
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,310
Bought her Hari. He's a God damn savage
to what did, what is he doing these days?

1306
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:52,460
Is he going to jail again
or what's happening? Sure.
Out what his, uh, his, uh,

1307
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:56,230
what that situation is. But I think
he's based training for a fight.

1308
01:10:56,231 --> 01:10:59,020
I think he's fighting in
a global fighting, um,

1309
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:02,970
championships and Russia or somewhere now
these, and I was fighting glory. He's,

1310
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,140
I don't think that'll
hasn't glory get that guy.

1311
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:10,270
I asked myself the same question. Fun
heavyweight. He's a fun heavyweight guys.

1312
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:14,300
One of my all time favorites. So
yeah, that dude's a mad. Yeah. Yeah.

1313
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,870
I'm not sure he's going to pass
any piss tests, but he's a,

1314
01:11:16,871 --> 01:11:20,130
he's a mad dog and a lot
of fun to watch that.

1315
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,190
That's kickboxing scene is
not one for Piss test. So

1316
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,960
yeah, that's, that's one
good way of putting it.

1317
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:32,190
I think America's the only country in
the world that really drug tests their

1318
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:34,150
athletes. You know, especially
with fighting, you know,

1319
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,470
I don't think that there's any drug
testing and you know, one's are paying.

1320
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,030
There was definitely in
the drug that was in Japan.

1321
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:41,720
They drug test you to make sure you're
doing steroids to make sure you're doing

1322
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:46,050
yeah. Make sure I have a
friend who, uh, was, uh,

1323
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:50,140
it was a natural, I mean he should
have been fine. One 55 and uh,

1324
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:54,060
he was going over to Japan and they
wanted him to fight one 85. Yeah.

1325
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,490
They were like, you know, you're
a big guy. Let's do some juice.

1326
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:58,500
Let's get you pumped up.
And he was like, what?

1327
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,010
He leads used to deal with American
promoters where they never said that.

1328
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:04,110
Then they sat,
they sat them down and flew him out there,

1329
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,010
sat them down and they essentially told
him to get on steroids. What did he do?

1330
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:13,290
He did. He did. He wound up finding
an America, but he went over there,

1331
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,410
you know, and had the meeting and he had
one fight over there and they, you know,

1332
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:18,420
they liked him but they
wanted him to go up.

1333
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,210
Think he fought over there
at one 60 and they, uh,

1334
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:24,720
they wanted them to fight one 85. Like
what the fuck are you guys talking about?

1335
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,640
I mean, it's one thing if you're like,
you're a big guy already and they're like,

1336
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:32,440
oh, we want me to go up and wait.
So yeah, you're really good. But uh,

1337
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,100
we want you to put on 20 pounds
of muscle on fight. Well,

1338
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:39,840
I think in Japan they feel like the larger
weight classes are the ones that sell

1339
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:43,650
the most. And I think that was
their, their, their thought process.

1340
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:46,440
He's a good looking guy. They
feel like this guy give, put them,

1341
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,750
puts a big muscles on him, we're
going to make some money. You know,

1342
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,450
they're definitely not thinking like, Hey,
for your career, this is the best move.

1343
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,830
Right? Or your safety. Well,

1344
01:12:55,831 --> 01:13:00,120
you hear those stories about the
Yakuza back in their pride. Glory days,

1345
01:13:00,121 --> 01:13:04,430
giving you bowling ball bags filled with
money. I heard a few stories like that.

1346
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,750
They show up at a,

1347
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,030
you know your hotel room the night before
the fight with like grocery shop. Yeah.

1348
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,590
Bags full of money. What guys?
I'm take them back with them.

1349
01:13:13,591 --> 01:13:17,490
They would be taping rolls of money to
their body because you're going to take

1350
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:18,980
$10,000 or something back.

1351
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:23,010
So they'd be literally taping stacks
of money to their body to try to get

1352
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:26,490
through security voice had like every
member of his entourage had to hold like

1353
01:13:26,491 --> 01:13:31,200
$10,000 to go on the plane to go back
after. Yeah, but try explaining that.

1354
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,810
So you traveled with this dude and
he's got 10 grand to and this guy,

1355
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:35,640
well no coincidence.
She's got 10 grant.

1356
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:37,790
How's this going to have 10
grand to what did you guys do?

1357
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,890
Fucking find some money over there.
Like what the hell happened in Japan?

1358
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:46,110
No taxes for that. The glory days. It's a,

1359
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,480
that's a beautiful thing
about this sport though,

1360
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:51,630
that the glory days were only like a
decade ago. Right. You know, it's like,

1361
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,890
it's so young,

1362
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,700
22 years since the UFC was first created,

1363
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,630
it's hard to believe and that those guys
in the glory day are still competing

1364
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,350
now. You have a lot of them. Yeah.

1365
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:07,230
So is your plan to see glory days
and you're fighting and glory?

1366
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:11,100
I would love it if glory became really
successful because I'm a huge fan

1367
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,033
kickboxing,

1368
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,300
but I don't know. I mean
how, how successful was their
pay per view venture? Uh,

1369
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:19,480
the piggery venture, I didn't think, I
don't think I did very good at all. Um,

1370
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:24,010
but I think it was more about
us, like a, a strategic thing.

1371
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,110
Like if you give away your product
for free all the time, then it's,

1372
01:14:27,111 --> 01:14:30,190
it's hard to ever establish, okay, now
you have to pay for it. And you know,

1373
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:33,310
so I think they did that as more of like,
it needed to do a pay per view,

1374
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,530
but they're put repeat
buys weren't that great.

1375
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:39,640
Which I think was kind of unfortunate
because that was like the end all be all

1376
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:43,540
for a combat sports in one night. You
know, you gotta put that on Spike TV.

1377
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:46,810
I think that would have done huge
numbers for building their brand,

1378
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,070
but they had a great,

1379
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:52,360
you know the other thing they did on that
was they had two cards one at one time,

1380
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:55,570
so you have, you know, cro
cop was the main event on the,

1381
01:14:55,660 --> 01:15:00,310
on the card at that was live on spike
TV and I think it's just hard to get

1382
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,780
people,
I mean I love kickboxing,

1383
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:05,230
but I'm not going to watch it for an
hour and a half and then pay another 60

1384
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:07,710
bucks to watch it for another hour
and a half hours a night. You know?

1385
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,110
I think that was just a, well
they tried the UFC, the strategy,

1386
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:15,460
the way the UFC has the prelims on Fox
sports one and they have the main boughts

1387
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:19,000
on paper view afterwards. They
tried that strategy, but the UFC,

1388
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:20,320
it's just way more established.

1389
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:23,860
I think it's really hard to do that with
kickboxing because for the most part,

1390
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,810
most of the people that are watching have
no idea who anybody fighting is. Right.

1391
01:15:26,811 --> 01:15:31,210
So you watch now shilling except Joe
Schilling and uh, whoever he fights.

1392
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:35,380
But if you watch the UFC, you're, you're,

1393
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:37,360
they're prepping you for the big stars.

1394
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:42,400
But they haven't really established Gloria
enough to have big stars yet. But man,

1395
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:45,610
I level of kickboxing is so high and it's,
it's,

1396
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:50,950
it's got a frustrating because
you know, for the, for the, uh,

1397
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:54,480
what do you call like the, the new
fan. Even for him, it may, you know,

1398
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:55,780
you still get people like all,

1399
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:58,390
what's this boring stuff on the ground
that don't appreciate the sport.

1400
01:15:58,391 --> 01:16:01,090
They just want to see the, you
know, the action or whatnot.

1401
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,590
Like those people need to tune
into kickboxing. You know,

1402
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,800
those people need to eat paint rep,
they all need to eat, lead, paint,

1403
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:12,820
go fuck themselves. It's just
so many, this whole fans,

1404
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,100
that's the one thing that
does disappoints me so bad.

1405
01:16:15,101 --> 01:16:19,510
When I go on Twitter and I read like a
fighter will post something, you know,

1406
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:22,570
after the fight and you
read all the people talking
shit about them and just oh,

1407
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:27,020
fucking rice to man,
there are so many douche bag and it's,

1408
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,540
it's kind of worse for him
and May, you know, uh, yeah,

1409
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:35,980
obviously like there was a
lot more exposure from my
fight with, um, with Melvin.

1410
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:39,050
You know, I always knew that there was a
bigger fan base for MMA then there was a

1411
01:16:39,051 --> 01:16:41,710
kickboxing, but I had no idea
how much bigger it was. You know,

1412
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,560
when I won the glory a glory 10,

1413
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:49,270
that was the first American to ever win
a global combat tournament ever. And uh,

1414
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:50,440
it was like a huge deal.

1415
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:53,080
It was the biggest pay day I think
of American kickboxing history.

1416
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:56,590
And I think there was like three
stories down on me about it total.

1417
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:59,770
And then my fight with
Melvin was, uh, you know,

1418
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:03,250
it wasn't for title or for ranking and
you know, it was just the one fight.

1419
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,390
And you know, it's, it's been all kinds
of publicity and more following from that.

1420
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:09,980
But like within like two days,
there was people on

1421
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,550
my Instagram like just
writing the most degrading,

1422
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:18,551
disrespectful shit about like my family
and my mom and my just ridiculous stuff.

1423
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,050
And then, uh, so you know, you get more
fans, you get more in a whack jobs,

1424
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:26,940
but there definitely seems
to be a little bit more um,

1425
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:31,100
ignorant fans that did hang out
trash and people and even may,

1426
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:34,430
there's just so many dummies in this
world to get Terry, right? Yeah.

1427
01:17:34,431 --> 01:17:37,730
And they have, they have an outlet to
reach you. Where's before, you know,

1428
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:39,980
they would just be yelling at each
other at the gas station. You know,

1429
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:41,140
they're going to go into a wall.

1430
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:43,010
He ain't going to hold our
kicking [inaudible] ass.

1431
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,620
And that's where it would end right now.
These,

1432
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,570
these delicate tweet directly at me,

1433
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:50,300
they have an Instagram and they get on
your page and you should leave these

1434
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:53,970
posts. You read them, you just go,
fuck man. Imagine if, you know,

1435
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:57,650
someone came from another planet and they
were trying to understand what people

1436
01:17:57,651 --> 01:18:01,040
were like and they read comments on
Instagram, right. They'd be like, well,

1437
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:04,580
we got a nuke, this fucking thing. Nuke
this thing from orbit. It'd be like,

1438
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,610
like that movie aliens.
I've got a new kit for more,

1439
01:18:07,611 --> 01:18:09,890
but just to be sure like these assholes,

1440
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,270
these guys have bombs and missiles and
this is the way they think, you know?

1441
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,660
It's not indicative of the,
the best example of humanity,

1442
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,580
especially combat sports. There's
something about fighting, well,

1443
01:18:21,581 --> 01:18:24,710
it kind of sports in general, man,
I've been, I'm not a sports fan.

1444
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,020
I don't pay attention
to football or baseball,

1445
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:30,370
but every now and then I
will read like comments,

1446
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:35,240
sections on blogs just to see
like if they're the same as like,

1447
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:39,130
and it's the same shit. Same
Shit. What's up? Yeah. He got

1448
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:44,210
a seven in the morning and
that's a desperado cocaine move.

1449
01:18:44,211 --> 01:18:47,450
I test that motherfucker
immediately fired from ESPN.

1450
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,980
Did they fire up immediately fired from
ESPN. That's hilarious. That's hilarious.

1451
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:55,100
Did she give him a raise?
At least she's not raping anybody.

1452
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:59,190
It's trying to get a hook is trying to
pay for it. Give the man a break. Ugh.

1453
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:03,140
That's the worst possible. Like
what? What could be worse than that?

1454
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:06,900
Prostitution was getting
caught picking up prostitutes.

1455
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,720
They shouldn't even be a big deal.

1456
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:12,110
That's the guy's trying to get a massage
on his dick. That's all it is. I mean,

1457
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:14,720
look, if, if it's seven o'clock in the
morning, he was trying to get a massage.

1458
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:17,420
Nobody would bat an eye. You're trying
to get somebody to touch you for money.

1459
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:21,980
That's what it is, but oh no, they're
touching the bath. Bought the Nadia.

1460
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:26,060
Ooh, this is crazy. You know if you had,

1461
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:31,040
if you paid a woman to the sock on the
back of your neck, nobody. We'd be like,

1462
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:34,880
ah, okay. Yeah. I paid her 1000
bucks a suck on the back of my neck.

1463
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:39,020
People would be like, okay, all
right, we'll get an that's seems okay.

1464
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:44,010
We checked the rules. That's all right,
but I paid her to suck my Dick. Fuck it.

1465
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,430
Why did you say, why would you do
that? You're fire. It feels good.

1466
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:51,590
What did I do wrong? I don't know. She
needed 1000 bucks. I need a blow job.

1467
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:57,380
Who got hurt here? I'm so fucking
confused. Well, the sponsors,

1468
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:01,430
the sponsors won't tolerate it. Joe
Schilling, we need to sell Gatorade.

1469
01:20:01,431 --> 01:20:05,660
We're not selling blowjobs. It's
fucking ridiculous. It is fucking,

1470
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:08,880
we live in a goofy,
goofy babyworld.

1471
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:13,530
This is an infant tile
world guy gets arrested.

1472
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:17,010
Fucking soliciting prostitution. Who's
was, did he hit up a cop or something?

1473
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:19,550
I don't know that I had heard the
whole story. I was hoping you knew.

1474
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,990
Do you know what happened? Jamie? You
should know you're the gossip monger.

1475
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,460
He admitted to, I guess
the girls said that, uh,

1476
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:29,700
he was assaulting them two girls. Oh.
And then when the cops came for that,

1477
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:34,080
he admitted to the solicitation
of prostitution, but not
the, not the assault.

1478
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,790
Oh, so he's a douchebag. All right. I
take it back. Yeah. She know what man, if,

1479
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:43,770
if there was like a legit establishment
where he could go to and just give them

1480
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,990
money and it just, to me, look,

1481
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,990
I have daughters and the last thing I
would ever want is my daughters to be

1482
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:50,820
prostitutes.
However,

1483
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:55,710
I believe that part of our issue that we
have as human beings with prostitution,

1484
01:20:55,740 --> 01:21:00,740
it's just this weird puritan view of
sex that sex is somehow or another this

1485
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,450
forbidden evil thing.

1486
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,020
It's just two people
touching each other's bodies.

1487
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,610
No babies are getting eaten,
you know,

1488
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,610
and then no fucking slaves
are getting whipped.

1489
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:15,180
No one's getting tossed off cliffs.
This is not a horrible thing.

1490
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,450
It's fine if you do it for free,
right?

1491
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,700
No one has any problem
if you have sex for free.

1492
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,780
The idea that if you give someone money
and you have sex all of a sudden is this

1493
01:21:24,781 --> 01:21:29,070
terrible, awful evil thing.
I think that's stupid.

1494
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,020
I think it's stupid and it's,

1495
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:36,300
it's archaic in this world that we live
in is changing and people are starting

1496
01:21:36,301 --> 01:21:38,460
to realize that adult human being,
look,

1497
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:42,990
you got a fucking hundred years on
this planet if you're lucky. That's it.

1498
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:48,320
It's just this wild ride of good times
and hopefully friends and good food and

1499
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:54,860
lump wonderful life experiences and who
the fuck is anybody to tell you that

1500
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:59,420
paying for sex or someone paying
you for sex is bad? I mean,

1501
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,440
who is that?
Who are those people?

1502
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:04,230
But those are the same assholes to
tell you shouldn't pay for weed.

1503
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,610
He shouldn't be able to smoke weed.

1504
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,300
The same assholes that tell
you you shouldn't be able
to do psychedelics or you

1505
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:12,750
shouldn't be able to whatever the fuck
it is, if it's not hurting anything,

1506
01:22:12,751 --> 01:22:15,330
Nancy graces of the world.
That's it. That's it.

1507
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:19,180
Did you see her have a interview
with two Chainz? Oh my God,

1508
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:23,820
I was so like, first of all, someone
stole one of two chains chains,

1509
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:26,640
cause he only had one chain on. I was
getting the whole video. I was like,

1510
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:29,490
where's the other chain?
Motherfuckers got one chain.

1511
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:36,120
You can't call yourself two chains
and have a fucking debate on CNN. Sir.

1512
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,120
You need to use your goddamn birth
name. All right, I need to see it.

1513
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:42,090
Fucking birth certificate,
driver's license, two Chainz,

1514
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,270
two chains. You know, I'm
not, not, my name's is Joe
Schilling. It's crazy donkey.

1515
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:53,390
You know, if, what would your rap name
be? What would that wrap? Maybe? I Dunno.

1516
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:57,440
Would it just be, this is can't stop
crazy. I guess. So this cancer, what did,

1517
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,980
where that slogan can't stop crazy
come from? That actually came from a,

1518
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:06,000
I think it was my second pro Muy Thai
fight. I just kind of went berserk and uh,

1519
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,640
with elbows and knees and one of the
guys that train in my gym was like, aw,

1520
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:10,840
you know,
you can't stop crazy.

1521
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:13,330
And I just remember thinking that it
was the dumbest thing I've ever heard at

1522
01:23:13,331 --> 01:23:16,960
the time. Dude. Later on. Um, uh,

1523
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:21,100
there was a time when before glory,
before lion fight got a TV deal,

1524
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:26,101
there was a kickboxing and the
shoulder shows that I was fighting on.

1525
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,460
The fans didn't really have any connection
to any one of the fighters unless you

1526
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:31,870
went to every show.
So there was,

1527
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:35,170
it was really hard to set
yourself apart as you know,

1528
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:38,560
the high level guy or the better guy,
like who was really doing it, you know,

1529
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:43,210
because there was no media in bottle
and uh, me and like the other, um,

1530
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:48,660
five or six best kick boxers
and the United States got
together and started like

1531
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:52,730
our own website and started
promoting ourselves. And we are got,

1532
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:57,640
are the best photographers in the sport
and kind of just built our own media for

1533
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:02,550
ourselves. And um, you know, eventually
lion fight gone, got a TV deal and um,

1534
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:03,580
you know,
glory came,

1535
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:06,250
but for a long time it was just us
kind of making it for ourselves.

1536
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,580
And we're like, what do we call it? And
it was like, oh, can't stop crazy. Okay,

1537
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:12,190
that's cool. There's kind of a movement.
It really kind of took off. It's,

1538
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,560
it's weird.
I can't even describe what it is now.

1539
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:18,070
People always ask me to describe it.
It's just a group of people that, uh,

1540
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,230
we sell t shirts and we used to,
uh,

1541
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,800
do our own interviews and
with no TV backing, you know,

1542
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:27,630
there was nobody promoting us. You know,
these are the shirts right here. Some

1543
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:33,950
you could wear this, this is 100%
douche free. No one would have any idea.

1544
01:24:33,951 --> 01:24:35,870
Note the lack of skulls.
Yup.

1545
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:40,910
There's no swords going through a broken
skull with a snake wrapped around it.

1546
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,940
There's no pit bulls getting
fucked in the ass by a dragon.

1547
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:49,760
It's still actually a juror.
If you're listening or
designer, I would like a shirt

1548
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:53,090
made with a pimple getting
fucked in the ass by a dragon

1549
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,930
in glitter glitter and that's
going to be the Joe Rogan show.

1550
01:24:56,710 --> 01:24:59,260
Some Japanese foil writing behind,

1551
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:02,270
you know? Yeah. I don't know man.

1552
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:06,120
The uh, the world of [inaudible]
dropped off pretty quick.

1553
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:07,820
I remember that was like,
I wonder why

1554
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:13,090
Ed Hardy was like, it
was like a, what was it?

1555
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:16,430
It was like von Dutch for people with head
injuries. Yeah. It was like, you know,

1556
01:25:16,431 --> 01:25:19,640
people like by von Dutch.
It's just fucking too clever
for me. I mean, you think,

1557
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,490
what do you think really
started that downfall for them?

1558
01:25:22,491 --> 01:25:24,350
Was it the whole Kogan show where he wore,

1559
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,930
they call Kogan was like their poster
boy for it and then they kind of,

1560
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,930
I think it's just overexposure
anytime things get, I mean,

1561
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,130
people love those old school
Americana Tattoos, which to me,

1562
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:37,490
that's what Ed hardy always used to
represent. Like it was kind of cool.

1563
01:25:37,491 --> 01:25:41,330
Those old like sailor tattoos, like
dough. I liked those and then flip it,

1564
01:25:41,331 --> 01:25:44,400
dazzled the shit out of it. Yeah. Then
it was like, what is going on here?

1565
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,270
And then it became this weird,
it was like a von Dutch thing.

1566
01:25:47,271 --> 01:25:50,720
Like von Dutch used to be the
fucking shit. Ashton Kutcher,

1567
01:25:50,721 --> 01:25:53,750
we used to wear the stupid trucker
hats and everybody was like, man,

1568
01:25:53,751 --> 01:25:56,090
I gotta get one yet. And I
would look at it, I was like,

1569
01:25:56,091 --> 01:25:57,890
what the fuck are you wearing man,

1570
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:02,270
that looks like you wearing like
some diner in like Cincinnati.

1571
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:04,190
They have like a hat

1572
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,860
that they sell, you know? That's what
it looked like. You know what I mean?

1573
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:11,680
Like it's just some obscure
like truck stop diner,

1574
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,050
you know? And then all of a sudden all
these people were wearing it like that,

1575
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:18,710
you know, full tilt it to soil. I'm crazy.
It's just, I don't know what happened,

1576
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,610
but it became this thing that Douche
bags would wear. I don't know.

1577
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:26,270
I don't know how it happened. Yeah.
But it went and it came and everybody,

1578
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:30,230
you know what it was like,
it's like the spinning wheels of clothing.

1579
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,080
Remember those spinners that
people used to have on the rims?

1580
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,890
They lasted a little while where people
are like, what the fuck are we doing?

1581
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:37,850
And it,

1582
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:42,380
those spinners killed the custom
wheel market because you used to be,

1583
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:45,110
everybody would get a car and
then they would get custom wheels.

1584
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:48,560
Like you can take a pretty decent car
but put some sweet wheels on it and

1585
01:26:48,561 --> 01:26:49,760
everybody like that's a pretty nice car.

1586
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,090
But those fucking spinners came out
and everybody's like, that's it.

1587
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:55,430
We're going the other way.
Don't ever change your wheels.

1588
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,730
Just leave the fucking wheels. The car
came with like, this is ridiculous.

1589
01:26:58,731 --> 01:27:01,730
We can't be associated with this.
You notice that

1590
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:04,590
now it's like they're,

1591
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:09,820
they're like painted wheels
are like stand like low chain.

1592
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,080
Yeah. Low Key. You know,
he might have nice wheels,

1593
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:13,490
but they're like painted black and match.

1594
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:17,600
Your car was giant gold spinning,
you know?

1595
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:20,660
And then they had like 28 or something,
they came out where it was like,

1596
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:24,560
I took the wheel and then they would like
make the lip of the wheel even bigger.

1597
01:27:24,561 --> 01:27:25,840
So it looked like, you know, yeah.

1598
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:29,690
They had tires that were like literally
the thickness of an iPhone. You know,

1599
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:33,350
that was what it was like your tire and
they put it on like a old Monte Carlo

1600
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:38,390
now. Now it's like a Monte Carlo Monster
Truck. You know, that's a common thing,

1601
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:39,740
right?
Those impalas,

1602
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:43,760
they would put it on these ridiculous
cars if like wagon wheels. They were like,

1603
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:47,990
dude, the most preposterous wheels ever.
And those things break all the time.

1604
01:27:47,991 --> 01:27:51,440
You go over a bump, hit a pothole,
there's no tire. This isn't,

1605
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,830
it's like you're running around
on metal rooms. They bend. Yeah,

1606
01:27:54,831 --> 01:27:58,610
I put a 20 inch wheels on
my, my accurate, and it's,

1607
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:02,090
they're not like flashy. They're
like paint black wheels or whatever.

1608
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:04,730
But the either had a role,
the offenders,

1609
01:28:04,731 --> 01:28:07,590
which I didn't realize when I bought the
car, but what kind of accurate you got?

1610
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,400
That's a TL. Nothing, nothing
spectacular. But it's, uh,

1611
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:16,490
when I got the wheels, I, uh, I
didn't know that you couldn't fit 20.

1612
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:19,460
I just want to go. They rubbed out.
They would rubbed unless you rolled the,

1613
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,080
so I got, when I ordered
it, they were like, well,

1614
01:28:21,081 --> 01:28:24,530
you need to get these 30 fives
are 30 tires or whatever.

1615
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,440
I didn't know what it was. Apparently
a 30 tire is like this big, very thin.

1616
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:32,390
It's incredibly thin and you know,
it looks cool, but I'm constantly,

1617
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:36,150
every time I drive up north, I get, I get
a flat tire. I like all the time I've,

1618
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,240
I've had to repair the,
uh,

1619
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:42,270
the rims like three or four times
just because the tire gets so low. Oh,

1620
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:46,580
he hit a bump and it puts a hole in the
or bins or cracks the rim. Yeah. Go,

1621
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:49,900
go back to standards. They go put
my stock wheels back up. Yeah.

1622
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:53,240
Put The stock wheels back on. Accurate.
Makes a fucking hell of a car though.

1623
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:56,260
They're underappreciated car.
Yeah, they really are. I love it.

1624
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:01,140
Two of those I had to Nsx is there. My,
I still might go out and buy an old one.

1625
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,140
I'm still, I'm looking for one that
was fucking cars are great, man.

1626
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:06,630
I loved that car.
Never had a problem.

1627
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:11,460
Every time you go to start rumbling
starts right up on does just do,

1628
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:16,050
you can't fuck with Toyotas and Hondas
that does. Motherfuckers will run forever.

1629
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:18,840
I had a Honda accord when
I was in high school.

1630
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,600
It was like a 92 Honda accord and I
never changed the oil and the thing.

1631
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:25,020
And the guy he does,
I didn't know money.

1632
01:29:25,021 --> 01:29:28,300
I drove around with $2 of the gas all
the time. Like you know, you never,

1633
01:29:28,301 --> 01:29:31,980
it never changes there. And I think
I ended up having two clutches.

1634
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:34,290
I went through two clutches cause
I was like fast and furious.

1635
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:37,300
The movie had come up like that and it
was like burnouts at every like stop

1636
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:41,370
playing man. I did a lot of dumb shit
with that car. You know those uh,

1637
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,720
those whippet Umm, things
where you can, it's like, uh,

1638
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:49,790
I think it's the actual use for it is a
to me like a whipped cream, yay carrier.

1639
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:50,520
But you can,

1640
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,760
it's like a canister and you can put a
little whip it cartridge in it and it'll

1641
01:29:53,761 --> 01:29:57,270
uh, he hit the button, it'll fill up and
you can fill up your balloon off of that.

1642
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:00,690
So I had,
it was like 16 or 17.

1643
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:04,340
I had wired like put a tube through my,
um,

1644
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:10,200
through my a glove box all the way
into my intake in the front and I put,

1645
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:13,380
I was like doing a little street racer
guy and I would crack off like four or

1646
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:16,560
five whippets in that little container
and thought I had an interest in my car

1647
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,700
to my glove box. It's your
story. But that Honda,

1648
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:24,870
I ended up giving it to a friend when
I got another car and he drove it

1649
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:28,050
literally until the wheel fell off till
the front wheel fell off and it had like

1650
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:32,220
over 325,000 miles on it.
And I think he, you know,

1651
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:36,140
never, you know, it just ran until the
wheel fell on Japanese make amazing cars.

1652
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:39,450
I have a friend who was Alexis
that has a million miles on it.

1653
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,170
It really a million. Yeah. It's
like, it's a famous car. Like,

1654
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,320
I don't know if it's his, he drives
uh, Matt Farah from the smoking tire.

1655
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:49,530
He always has a images of it.
He's, he brings it everywhere.

1656
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:53,220
It just puts it online. It's got a
million fucking miles on anything, a male.

1657
01:30:53,221 --> 01:30:55,260
Again,
they just don't break.

1658
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:59,130
This is like something happened
along the way where we,

1659
01:30:59,131 --> 01:31:01,380
it became acceptable for
cars to just fuck off.

1660
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:03,990
That's just be a piece of
shit and it's American cars.

1661
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:07,480
Why do we do that to ourselves? You
know? So he's just a, I mean it's like,

1662
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,960
it's always the, the Japanese cars
that lasts forever, don't they?

1663
01:31:10,961 --> 01:31:14,460
The Lexus or the Toyota or the Honda.
Even German cars, which are amazingly,

1664
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:18,390
I had German car, shit, they fuck up.

1665
01:31:18,391 --> 01:31:21,770
I know someone who has a
Porsche Cayenne and uh, she,

1666
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:24,790
she went to start at the other day,
catastrophic fucking failures.

1667
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,510
Engine light's on year old car.

1668
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:31,110
Probably like what a fucking hundred
60 grand or something like that.

1669
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:34,470
Cayenne turbo pressing buttons. All
these lights are going on. Like,

1670
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:37,880
what's going on here? Nothing. Got a tow
it and get it towed. They'd be like, oh,

1671
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:39,720
there's a problem wrong with your thing.

1672
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:41,910
And they replaced the thing and like what?

1673
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,730
Like what if you were in Alaska
and then shit went wrong.

1674
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,930
Like what if you're driving
across country? Yeah.

1675
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,950
You know when you're driving your
portion, Alaska, you never know.

1676
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,080
I guess there are people in Alaska
of portrait. This is must be,

1677
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:53,520
people don't want to ask
you about some cheese.

1678
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,780
I want to fucking be a ball out there
and drive under Mousse with a fucking

1679
01:31:57,781 --> 01:32:02,350
Cayenne. Yeah. It's something
about those Japanese cars though.

1680
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,040
They for whatever reason,
it's like the Japanese culture itself.

1681
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:10,660
You fought in Japan. I haven't, I
haven't. I would think that that's like a,

1682
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:11,411
for a,

1683
01:32:11,411 --> 01:32:16,330
especially for a kickboxer when it
comes down to like the k one glory days,

1684
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:20,490
those are probably the glory days of not
necessarily have more time because you

1685
01:32:20,491 --> 01:32:25,350
know, there's a lot of like the great
Moy Thai fighters particularly, uh,

1686
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:28,690
like in the lower weight classes
came out of Thailand. Yeah.

1687
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:33,910
But as far as like heavyweights and
the larger kickboxing bouts, like,

1688
01:32:33,911 --> 01:32:37,660
man, it all took place in Japan.
That's where, when I moved out here,

1689
01:32:37,661 --> 01:32:40,250
when I was a 19, I was, uh,

1690
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:44,320
going to school and then I couldn't
afford cable ahead of the job.

1691
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:48,340
It's like a room service attendant
at the Bonaventure hotel. But I had,

1692
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:49,450
I would go to this,
uh,

1693
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,600
video store and little Tokyo and
they sold all the k one videotapes,

1694
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,230
and that was where my girlfriend
coming over and just being like,

1695
01:32:56,231 --> 01:33:00,040
can we watch something else? So that was
all the time was just like all the time.

1696
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:04,180
K One max or a k one heavyweights. And
uh, yeah, I think that was the best,

1697
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:06,400
like the hundred foot giant screens,
you know,

1698
01:33:06,401 --> 01:33:10,870
the long walkways or as they had in k
one and that was the golden era of the

1699
01:33:10,871 --> 01:33:15,610
pageantry and it, which is
what Gloria is now, you know,
so I wish, yeah, I wish the,

1700
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:20,260
uh, the fans that love kid one
would pay attention to Gloria. Well,

1701
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,220
I just think he, for this
thing to fail, you know,

1702
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:26,350
so long that we're trying to get
this sport going and, uh, you know,

1703
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:30,400
nobody's gonna Watch a glory show and not,
not fall in love with it.

1704
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:33,490
You know what I mean? It's just ingrained.
Turn on the damn channel. You know,

1705
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:37,030
I told the UFC, you know, maybe
like seven or eight years ago,

1706
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:40,120
I told him to buy a k one cause
I heard the k one was for sale.

1707
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,530
I said you guys should buy k one.

1708
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:44,500
Does you know the ultimate fighter was
originally supposed to be the cabling?

1709
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:48,580
Really? What do you mean? Uh, Mike
Kogan, my manager told me this,

1710
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:52,030
he used to work with k one
and k one you will say what?

1711
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:53,830
Scott Cougar that the uh,

1712
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,050
the ultimate fighter TV show was
originally supposed to be um,

1713
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:01,750
k one on spike and they the deal
didn't go through or something.

1714
01:34:01,751 --> 01:34:06,550
And then Dana and the fatigue has picked
it up and did the UFC one originally it

1715
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:07,840
was supposed to be Kaitlin.

1716
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:11,230
I would double check on that
if it's coming from my Cogan.

1717
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:15,640
That's what he said. You
never know. He might be right.

1718
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,470
Joe Schilling is the most
gullible motherfucker,

1719
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:23,650
but I think that the levels
there, you know, like, like here,

1720
01:34:23,651 --> 01:34:27,730
like the big fight, Rico
Verhoeven, he's like, you know,

1721
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:32,170
like one of the best kick boxers you could
put him back in the k one glory days.

1722
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:35,620
I mean 85 right around a lot of
those big name guys. Oh yeah.

1723
01:34:35,621 --> 01:34:38,330
I mean like think about the guys
that they have. I mean there's,

1724
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:43,090
there's just like, there's a, there's a,
there's a wealth of talent in kickboxing.

1725
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:46,930
Especially like a lot of these European
guys, a lot of these guys from Holland,

1726
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:50,980
I mean there's so many good fighters.
It's not a lack of talent. It's,

1727
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:52,570
it's one of those things where it's like,

1728
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:57,900
at this point it's almost
like it just needs time.

1729
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,540
It's almost like it just needs,

1730
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:03,560
it's like if they're willing to do with
the UFC did and put that and put the

1731
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:07,970
show on and you know, I mean, look at
the, wait it out. Daniel Gita. I mean,

1732
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:11,510
[inaudible] Saki mean there's
a fucking great fighters.

1733
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:16,130
Can you guys have Keratan off now to
some really exciting fighters in the

1734
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:18,980
heavyweight division as well
as all the other divisions.

1735
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:20,280
But if they just take the,

1736
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,530
like the UFC was $44 million in the
hole before the ultimate fighter,

1737
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,890
he got on the air and they were
ready to pull the plug. They even,

1738
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,230
there was one point in
time where Dana had, um,

1739
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,350
had a conversation with Lorenzo
and they were like, look,

1740
01:35:33,351 --> 01:35:36,740
we can't keep hemorrhaging money. Let's
just sell it. Let's just get rid of this.

1741
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:39,710
Let's see what we can get for it. And
they were going to sell it at a big loss.

1742
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,080
And, um, the next day I'll look,

1743
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:45,980
Lorenzo slept on it and got up and
fucking changes my, I said, fuck it.

1744
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:49,460
Guns blazing. Let's go, let's keep
going. Let's ride this bitch out.

1745
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,880
Which is what you can do when
you're a billionaire. Yeah.
Well, I think that's, uh,

1746
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:55,440
that's probably not real far
from where, uh, you know,

1747
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:58,450
the glory story is right now. Uh, Pierre,

1748
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:02,330
the owner of glory and the had
a chairman or whatever is, uh,

1749
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:07,000
is definitely one funding of 90% of this
stuff and, and pushing that. So, you know,

1750
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:11,330
thank you Pierre. Please
keep it up. You know, unless
they're, you know, almost, look,

1751
01:36:11,331 --> 01:36:15,110
it's so cool. The product is
there. See that's the thing.

1752
01:36:15,111 --> 01:36:18,590
It's like the product is there, the
fights are there anybody who watches that?

1753
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:20,060
The,
the event that you were in,

1754
01:36:20,061 --> 01:36:23,270
the last man standing right at that
fucking shit is on my DVR for life.

1755
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:25,580
Which by the way,
it cut out before the end.

1756
01:36:25,581 --> 01:36:27,740
Somehow or another really don't
know what the fuck happened.

1757
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:31,220
Maybe I only recorded for three
hours or something like a retard,

1758
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,700
but the,
of any watches that tournament,

1759
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:39,290
it doesn't get hooked on glory and
hooked on kickboxing. You got no pulse.

1760
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:41,870
And that's the other thing about the
Gloria is doing, which I don't know,

1761
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,640
I don't know any of the
finance stuff about it,

1762
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:47,160
but they're not going cheap on there.
On any of it. You know what I mean?

1763
01:36:47,161 --> 01:36:50,810
Like that is a huge event.
The, the production is insane.

1764
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,500
The fighters are insane.
I mean all of it is just really top notch.

1765
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:58,400
You guys got Mike Tyson pimping for it
and now apparently they got Mike Tyson

1766
01:36:58,401 --> 01:37:02,600
doing this thing, which is a, it's
cool. Yeah. If you go to the glory page,

1767
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:06,980
go to Glory World series.com Mike
Tyson is doing the intro video,

1768
01:37:06,981 --> 01:37:10,640
which is pretty fucking bad ass and uh,
is uh,

1769
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:13,610
Rico Verhoeven versus a Errol Zimmerman.

1770
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:18,560
And then there's a you versus a,
this kid is only 20 years old. Huh?

1771
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:23,060
I think he's 22. Robert Thomas
from Canada. Is He 22? Yeah,

1772
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:26,270
they call him the White Dragon.
Jim, he's good. He's a good fighter.

1773
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:30,710
Is going to be interesting. Yep. Um,
have you seen him fight before? Yeah,

1774
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,110
I saw a couple of fights on line.
He fought a arts 11

1775
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:37,880
then he fought a Alex
Perreira who's another guy,

1776
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:42,210
the top 10 in Brazil and we came up
short on both of those. But you know,

1777
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:46,540
that was, I have a lot of respect for
somebody that young in his career as,

1778
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:51,300
as going after the top top fights. I mean
that was me. Um, the, I was the guy that,

1779
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:52,820
that one of those tough shots,

1780
01:37:52,821 --> 01:37:55,040
so I know how dangerous those
kind of people can be. Yeah.

1781
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:00,120
Last fight in glory was Gloria 18 in
November. He CalEd Mike Michael Mer. So,

1782
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:04,350
uh, I'm just going to be fun, man. I
just, I just loved the fact, like I said,

1783
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:08,580
that they're doing this and uh, Nicky
Holsten is fighting to, who's a fuck.

1784
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:13,380
He's so high level. He's, he's really
fun to watch. He's so fun to watch.

1785
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:15,660
Really good technical man.

1786
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:19,500
Everything he does just said
that classic, moist, you know,

1787
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:23,640
the classic kickboxing style from Holland.
His boxing is like from the Nolan.

1788
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:24,020
He's been,

1789
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:26,970
he's are going back and forth doing the
professional boxing over there between

1790
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:31,130
fights and uh, yeah, his hands are
really good. He is, he's my pick for,

1791
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:32,100
to win the tournament.

1792
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:36,210
But then they also got a Raymond Daniels
is human highlight real, you know,

1793
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:38,640
he's a really high level martial artists.

1794
01:38:38,641 --> 01:38:40,440
I don't know if I'd really
call him a kickboxer. Well,

1795
01:38:40,441 --> 01:38:45,441
he's becoming a kickboxer really like
a karate guy who's getting into MMA.

1796
01:38:45,631 --> 01:38:47,190
It was getting,
getting into kickbox you'd rather,

1797
01:38:47,191 --> 01:38:51,600
but the shit that he does like that,
that touched jumping sidekicks,

1798
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:56,520
spinning back kick in the air that
decode his last opponent with as well.

1799
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:58,170
But you don't do that on the bag.

1800
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,260
I got to know the height he does
that and then like the timing of it.

1801
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:05,100
It's really, really, it's really,
it's something else. Yeah.

1802
01:39:05,101 --> 01:39:06,750
He's learning the kickboxing game.

1803
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:09,720
We still got like some
gaps in his is striking.

1804
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:12,790
We see that especially the transitions
between kicking and punching. Right.

1805
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:16,500
But the stuff that he can do, you know,
and he's still fairly young. I mean,

1806
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:19,610
you could still learn it. He's an La
guy too, isn't it? Yeah, I think so.

1807
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,720
Do you ever train with him? I supported
them once, probably six years ago.

1808
01:39:24,721 --> 01:39:25,650
I think when,
um,

1809
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:29,120
they had that world combat league when
Chuck Norris tried his little thing,

1810
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:32,910
it was so geared for,
for his,

1811
01:39:32,911 --> 01:39:37,290
his type of style that karate guys like
none of the Moitai guys did very well in

1812
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:40,590
that. Um, well that world combat
league did they allow leg kicks,

1813
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:42,450
they love leg kicks butt
underneath those pants.

1814
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:46,230
We had thick shin pads on
like Oh really shin pads.

1815
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,730
And then there was only one, three minute
round they made you wear Shin Pads.

1816
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah.
Nope.

1817
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:55,290
There's one three minute round and it's
really hard to do to really make leg

1818
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:59,490
kicks that affective and three
minutes with giant shrimp heads on,

1819
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,230
you know what I mean? That
seems ridiculous. It was,

1820
01:40:01,231 --> 01:40:04,680
well Chuck Norris was Lee his league
and it was really geared around like the

1821
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:08,670
point karate guys and um,
and that type of style.

1822
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:10,830
You know what I found really
interesting about it though,

1823
01:40:10,831 --> 01:40:14,270
it was the lack of ring. I really
kinda liked that. I don't don't,

1824
01:40:14,271 --> 01:40:18,000
I'm not sure if the slower, yeah, for if
you don't know what I'm talking about.

1825
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:18,451
They kind of,

1826
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:22,740
it was almost like a very shallow swimming
pool or it's like it was flat in the

1827
01:40:22,741 --> 01:40:25,740
bottom. And then for folks
who didn't watch it, the,

1828
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:29,880
the edges were kind of sloped up but not,
not a big slope,

1829
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,960
just a slight slip,

1830
01:40:30,961 --> 01:40:33,810
just don't enough to let you know that
you're at the edge and then it would

1831
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:36,750
bring everybody back to the center.
It wasn't very big thing.

1832
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,450
But I think that for,
for MMA in particular,

1833
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:43,770
one of the things that drives people
crazy is people being pressed up against

1834
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:47,310
the cage. And like a lot of people
don't like that aspect of MMA.

1835
01:40:47,311 --> 01:40:50,880
Like the clinching up against the cage,
throwing knees to the leg and you know,

1836
01:40:50,881 --> 01:40:53,680
they get, they start booing and
they want everybody separate.

1837
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,790
I've always felt that like I have a
football game can be played in a fucking

1838
01:40:57,791 --> 01:41:02,380
China, a hundred yard field and a
basketball game to be played in this,

1839
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,840
you know,
really long court.

1840
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:08,770
Why can't an MMA fight
take place on a flat,

1841
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:11,260
like just big round,

1842
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:16,410
flat area like that where you don't have
a ring and there's like there's a red

1843
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:20,290
zone where you're out of bounds, you
know, and make that red zone, you know,

1844
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:24,670
whatever fucking five yards or something
like that and then bring everybody back

1845
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:26,260
to the center.
Well you don't have any of that.

1846
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,660
If you're going to get a take down,

1847
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:29,080
you've got to get an
honest fucking take down.

1848
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:30,190
Like you're doing a wrestling match,

1849
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:33,910
not pushing a guy up against the cage
and pulling his legs out from under him,

1850
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:36,700
but an actual legit takedown.
Like giving them pride.

1851
01:41:36,701 --> 01:41:39,460
It was a little harder to get a takedown.
Oh yeah. Cause he couldn't put, you know,

1852
01:41:39,461 --> 01:41:41,040
cause what they do is we'll
shove it up against the fence.

1853
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:45,340
Then they suck your legs out.
They use that a certain thing.

1854
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:49,870
I mean I have a lot more, I'm a lot
more comfortable defending takedowns um,

1855
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,520
in the middle.
You know,

1856
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:54,700
stuff like there's a lot easier to stop
and take that once they start smashing

1857
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:57,700
it against the cage than there's a
lot of different variables and yeah.

1858
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:01,030
How many fights like um, Tim, Sylvia,

1859
01:42:01,031 --> 01:42:03,890
I think it was Tim Silvia
and Brandon Vera. Really?

1860
01:42:03,891 --> 01:42:06,760
He spent like three rounds just smashed
against the side of the cage the whole

1861
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:11,200
time. It happens, it happens a lot and
people get crazy. They boo and they,

1862
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:15,210
you know, and it's also hard to
see through a cage. Like if you,

1863
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:19,300
if you're standing in, in, in the crowd,
even if you're in the, on the floor,

1864
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:23,740
if you know your couple of rows back
and there's a pillar and they're behind

1865
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:25,840
that pillar and they're fighting,
you can't see shit.

1866
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:28,060
You wind up looking up at the big screen.
That's what I was curious.

1867
01:42:28,061 --> 01:42:30,580
Maybe you could tell me about this.
When they're the UFC judges,

1868
01:42:30,581 --> 01:42:33,530
do they have a screen in front
of what to watch now? Okay.

1869
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:36,950
This is something that we had a complaint
about for a long time because I'm

1870
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,660
sitting there and the whole fight is
going on in the upside of the cage and you

1871
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:44,170
can't tell what's being
landed or what you know. Well,

1872
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:48,550
there's only punches and like a lot of
those punches that Anderson was thrown on.

1873
01:42:48,551 --> 01:42:51,340
Nick, you did a really good job of
blocking them, but if I'm 30 feet away,

1874
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:53,020
I can't tell if it landed or not.
Well,

1875
01:42:53,021 --> 01:42:55,840
it's sometimes it's really hard to
tell for while we're doing commentary,

1876
01:42:55,841 --> 01:42:58,960
like sometimes I have to watch a
replay to see if something landed.

1877
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:01,830
Like if a guy's got his back to you and
you see someone threw a punch and the

1878
01:43:01,831 --> 01:43:05,210
guy falls down, you're like,
oh, we got hit. But then you
watch and you go, oh no, no,

1879
01:43:05,211 --> 01:43:08,800
no. He stepped on his foot and
he slipped and then he went down.

1880
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:11,170
Like sometimes it'll
look like a guy got hit.

1881
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:14,950
Sometimes it's better to watch it at home.
Really? I used to watch it live. Yeah,

1882
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,950
we watch it at home. You're going
to get the perfect angle. You know,

1883
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:22,540
the UFC broadcast team, those
guys who were the production
guys, they're the best.

1884
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:26,350
I mean there are so good at
catching all the right angles.

1885
01:43:26,351 --> 01:43:29,560
The replays are always on point. They
know exactly what they're doing. Right.

1886
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:32,920
So you could, you could almost see
it better from home then you can.

1887
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:36,210
But there's a lot of people that
complain that like sit in the crowd,

1888
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:36,971
like I can't fucking see.

1889
01:43:36,971 --> 01:43:38,920
And they wind up like you see
like look out in the crowd,

1890
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:40,480
they're looking up at the giant screen.

1891
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:43,060
I've went to quite a few a
UFC fights were up. It's just,

1892
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,850
I feel like you go there for the energy,
you know what I mean? You're there,

1893
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:50,490
you're there for the energy of the crowd,
but like you're watching a screen. Yeah,

1894
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:54,380
yeah. Well it's an event. I mean
there's, there's nothing like it.

1895
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:57,290
Like when you're watching it,
like nick versus Anderson,

1896
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:00,260
like when they were about
to fight and you know,

1897
01:44:00,261 --> 01:44:03,290
and they're there in the center of the
cage and you know the referees reading

1898
01:44:03,291 --> 01:44:06,440
them the instructions and then they
back up and you're like, Holy Shit,

1899
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:10,880
it's happening right there and it's
fucking 30 feet away is about to go down.

1900
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:15,470
There's nothing like that.
That's some goosebump inducing shit.

1901
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:17,810
And then he lays it down and you're like,
Holy Shit.

1902
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:20,600
When he laid down and put
his hands on his head,

1903
01:44:20,601 --> 01:44:25,460
like he's taking a nap as wedge and like,
Yeah Dude,

1904
01:44:25,461 --> 01:44:28,180
I was careening, laughing, CTV.

1905
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:32,630
I was pounded on the table and crying,
laughing. I couldn't help myself.

1906
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:36,470
I just was so funny. It's so
good. Why W I had wondered too,

1907
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:40,100
whether or not nick was going to clown
them because all the stuff leading up to

1908
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:44,270
the fight was totally respectful. All the
stuff leading up to fight was like, hey,

1909
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:47,540
you know, nick was saying, I want
big names, I want a big name fight.

1910
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:51,500
This is a big name fight. So you know,
I respect him and we're ready to go.

1911
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:55,250
And then when it got to the octagon,
immediately he's talking shit.

1912
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:59,150
And you could see Anderson was just so
not comfortable being the guy that gets

1913
01:44:59,151 --> 01:45:01,550
shit talked to.
And I was telling him keep talking.

1914
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:04,580
Like I'll say like I said fucking with
and be like, keep fucking with him.

1915
01:45:04,581 --> 01:45:05,414
It's weird because

1916
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:07,810
when nick stopped fucking
with him in the later rounds,

1917
01:45:07,811 --> 01:45:12,520
Anderson started doing a lot better. You
know, I think no doubt has definitely um,

1918
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,860
you know,
the mind game and uh,

1919
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:17,850
I think it was a really good
strategy that he didn't come up

1920
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:18,933
and I,
he kind of,

1921
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:22,750
he said in the back that it was
going to do something like that. I,

1922
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:27,190
I had no idea he was going to lay down
and put his hands like that. Well,

1923
01:45:27,191 --> 01:45:29,860
he probably didn't even know before
he did that. I think he just,

1924
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:33,250
he just knew like if he's gonna, if he
doesn't want to engage with, you know,

1925
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:35,290
I think he said I'm going
to flip that switch.

1926
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:40,240
I didn't realize that was the switch he
was talking about what God was awesome

1927
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:43,630
and really like, it's hard.
Like, you know, that there's, uh,

1928
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:48,370
an article just came out and said it
was called the sober replay or like the

1929
01:45:48,371 --> 01:45:51,940
sober thought, like when you watch a
fight after like the next day or whatever.

1930
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:56,650
And when we were in the the corner,
you know, we're yelling instructions,

1931
01:45:56,651 --> 01:46:01,651
but between Gilbert and Nate Diaz and
Cesar Gracie and that all of us were just

1932
01:46:01,751 --> 01:46:03,820
sitting there like,
this guy is such a fucking beast.

1933
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:06,310
Like we are so blown away
by what he was doing.

1934
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:10,150
We were just so impressed and
I was really proud of him.

1935
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,060
Well, especially first
time finding it one 85 too.

1936
01:46:13,061 --> 01:46:16,960
He steps up and fights the greatest
ever at one 85 after two year layoff,

1937
01:46:17,470 --> 01:46:22,000
two year layoff words, not, you know, just
really not pursuing any fights at all.

1938
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:22,990
Just,
you know,

1939
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:26,470
made a shitload of money off the George
Saint Pierre fight and just laid back

1940
01:46:26,471 --> 01:46:30,670
and relaxed for a little bit and just
said he wanted a big fight. You know.

1941
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:33,180
I mean he had said before, he goes, I
want a title shot. And they're like, well,

1942
01:46:33,181 --> 01:46:36,250
we can't really just give you a title
shot. Like you got to beat somebody,

1943
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:41,190
you know, and this was an opportunity
to fight, you know, a guy who it'd be,

1944
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:42,970
it's just like getting a title shot.

1945
01:46:42,971 --> 01:46:47,880
I mean five round fight with Anderson
and then to do so well, I mean the,

1946
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:51,090
the judges' scorecards and they
gave it all five rounds to Anderson,

1947
01:46:51,091 --> 01:46:54,120
but every one of those rounds were
very competitive except the fourth.

1948
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,560
I think nick took off the fourth round,

1949
01:46:55,561 --> 01:46:57,840
but every one of those rounds I thought
it was really competitive and really

1950
01:46:57,841 --> 01:46:59,610
close.
He was competitive enough.

1951
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:02,450
And especially if you consider the
other fights in Anderson has been right.

1952
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:04,920
I think that's probably also,
you know,

1953
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:07,740
they say like you have to
beat the champion so to speak.

1954
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:11,070
I felt like you have to really beat
this underdog and it didn't feel like

1955
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,700
Anderson did it that much.
You know what I mean?

1956
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,360
You really didn't whoop Nick's ass.
He'd won. I felt like he wanted,

1957
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:21,120
I feel like he played it safe as fuck.
Right. I mean he threw some wild shit.

1958
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:23,880
He threw a wheel kick at one
point in time, but there was no,

1959
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:28,710
no moment in time where he was
treating nick the way nick treated him,

1960
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,220
you know where he was like, come on
bitch, like let's do this, let's do this.

1961
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,770
You know, like stood in front of
him. He just wasn't ready for that.

1962
01:47:34,771 --> 01:47:38,400
I mean the psychological aspect also
having a guy like nick taunt you.

1963
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:39,810
If nick knocked him out,

1964
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:43,080
like what if he was taunting him and then
all of a sudden boom, nick catches him,

1965
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:43,561
he's down.

1966
01:47:43,561 --> 01:47:47,550
Like that would just be devastating
and he just was not prepared for that.

1967
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:51,140
Or Nick lays on the ground and
he jumps into the next garden.

1968
01:47:51,141 --> 01:47:52,970
Niggas trying to name triangles.
Yeah.

1969
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,760
Anything can fucking happen in MMA and
a guy like Anderson knows it as much as

1970
01:47:56,761 --> 01:48:01,050
anybody now, especially after it
happened to him. Right. I think also too,

1971
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:05,190
the pressure of competing at that high
level and being the champ for as long as

1972
01:48:05,191 --> 01:48:06,690
Anderson was like,

1973
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:10,230
I remember when Bj Penn beat
Matt Hughes and I talked to Matt,

1974
01:48:10,231 --> 01:48:13,680
he was after it was over and he was really
honest about it in the cage. He said,

1975
01:48:13,681 --> 01:48:18,480
honestly, is a relief. Like being a
champion is a lot of fucking stress.

1976
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:22,530
You know, he didn't swear, but he was
like, it's, it's, it's a relief. You know,

1977
01:48:22,531 --> 01:48:25,770
I'm glad I got this weight lifted off
my back and I'm gonna go back and relax

1978
01:48:25,771 --> 01:48:28,490
and see what's up. And that's kind
of the impression I got from Georgia.

1979
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:32,820
And I was talking to George. He's
the same way though. It's extremely,

1980
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:37,980
there's a ton of pressure to be a champion
for that long. And then everybody,

1981
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,950
you know, everybody wants
you, everybody calls you out,

1982
01:48:40,951 --> 01:48:43,530
everybody wants to fight you.
Everybody attacks your character.

1983
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,880
That's got to get pretty old.

1984
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,910
And Nick was talking about that the
other day and his post fight interview,

1985
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:49,100
he's like, you know, I wish I would fall.

1986
01:48:49,101 --> 01:48:53,160
I kind of wish I fell off and people
stopped talking about me. Well,

1987
01:48:53,161 --> 01:48:56,310
he's such an enigma, you know,
there's no one liked Nick Diaz,

1988
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:59,700
such an unusual character.
He really is. I mean,

1989
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:02,730
I'm good friends with them and I really
have no fucking idea what's going on in

1990
01:49:02,731 --> 01:49:06,870
his head 90% of the time, which actually
makes it really fun sometimes. You know.

1991
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,420
How often do you train with him?
Uh,

1992
01:49:09,421 --> 01:49:12,510
I was training with them a lot for the
mill and fight until my dad died. I left,

1993
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:17,160
uh, his, his pad to go to
the funeral and stuff. Um,

1994
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,230
but yeah, I'm go up there
pretty, pretty regularly.

1995
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:23,460
And when nick is in between camps is,
I mean like does he,

1996
01:49:23,461 --> 01:49:25,080
is he training on a regular basis?

1997
01:49:25,081 --> 01:49:28,680
Does he still do everything or is
he just a relaxing, like what does,

1998
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:32,040
what does he been doing and like over the
two years? Yeah, when I was, had the, uh,

1999
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:37,230
last man standing tournament, that was
back in northern June, June or July,

2000
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:40,260
he hadn't, I don't think he had booked
through the intercept fight yet.

2001
01:49:40,290 --> 01:49:44,040
He still was running with me and I mean
I'm training for the hardest part of my

2002
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:47,350
life were running six and a half miles
and he's pushing me like I'm trying to

2003
01:49:47,351 --> 01:49:48,140
keep up with him.

2004
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:52,360
Wow. He runs at a ridiculous pace.
He's just your runs or an insane pace.

2005
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:55,450
Does that fuck with your explosion at all?

2006
01:49:55,510 --> 01:50:00,280
Like there's some people that believe
that all that slow running and slow twitch

2007
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:04,600
endurance type work that again
actually fuck with your explosion.

2008
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:07,980
A Knicks guys disagree with me, but I
think it does. I think that him, uh,

2009
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,030
nick and Nate both are,
uh,

2010
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:13,840
not the most like a explosive people
when it comes to like their movement

2011
01:50:13,841 --> 01:50:16,780
patterns or whatever.
I feel like with me doing more,

2012
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:20,890
I do a lot more sprint work than I
do long distance kind of stuff. Um,

2013
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:23,670
but also like that's more of
their, of their style. They're,

2014
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:25,300
they're very technical with their stuff.

2015
01:50:25,301 --> 01:50:27,850
They don't use a lot of strength and they,
uh,

2016
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:33,390
both of them will wear you out and
then whoop your ass after it. Right.

2017
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:37,450
Both of them have beat the piss out
of me from just being durable as shit.

2018
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:39,910
And I'm throwing and throwing and
throwing and throwing and throwing and I'm

2019
01:50:39,911 --> 01:50:42,280
like, Oh fuck, I'm tired. And
then there's a bump motherfucker.

2020
01:50:42,281 --> 01:50:46,840
Yet they still talking shit. Once you're
tired they start talking to Ya. Well,

2021
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:50,020
just the whole time, you know, the whole
time he, you're sparring let me talk shit.

2022
01:50:50,021 --> 01:50:54,300
Like what's he saying? Uh, you know, uh, I
don't know. Come on, Shit like that. Nay.

2023
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,660
When, um, let's see, when the, uh,

2024
01:50:58,210 --> 01:51:00,480
for this last fight we
were sparring and nicotine,

2025
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:04,360
I think it was when the UFC was filming
it. Um, nick had done like nine,

2026
01:51:04,361 --> 01:51:05,980
five minute rounds with fresh guys.

2027
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:09,250
I was like me cheaty and Connie had
brought in to spar with him and then, um,

2028
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:13,090
another guy and like the last round I
could tell he was tired and it was kind of

2029
01:51:13,091 --> 01:51:15,730
like clenching me up against the fence
and was like holding or whatever.

2030
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:18,480
And I'm like, come on Nicole school, like
kind of like motivated and he's like,

2031
01:51:18,481 --> 01:51:22,910
fuck you motherfucker. And like
started whoop my ass. Like you know,

2032
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:27,700
the thing about without
cause has mentioned is like
sometimes it's a lot better,

2033
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:29,290
which I agree with.
It's a lot better.

2034
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:32,020
Sometimes disbar people you don't
know instead of like your buddy,

2035
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:32,883
you know you get,

2036
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:36,160
you go a little harder or you're a
little more competitive with somebody you

2037
01:51:36,161 --> 01:51:38,230
don't know.
And like when nick and I first started,

2038
01:51:38,231 --> 01:51:41,360
I mean he used to be a lot more
competitive with me and then now we're,

2039
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:43,660
we're pretty good friends so I have to,

2040
01:51:43,661 --> 01:51:47,380
I find myself like talking shit to him
or trying to piss him off or hit him hard

2041
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:51,400
to get him to, to push a little
harder. That's interesting.

2042
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:56,230
So replicates and actual competition
more in that way then it does like light

2043
01:51:56,231 --> 01:51:58,960
sparring with your friends. Right?
I mean I think there's different,

2044
01:51:58,990 --> 01:52:01,390
there's different times, different
stuff, you know, like something,

2045
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:06,820
I'm at the point now where I don't feel
like I don't have to win in sparring. I,

2046
01:52:06,821 --> 01:52:10,510
you know, I can work on other
things. I can work on my
defense, I'll work on stuff.

2047
01:52:10,511 --> 01:52:12,640
Whereas I used to be like
I have to win in sparring.

2048
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:16,870
If I lost around in sparring, I was
really upset about it. Um, but like nick,

2049
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:21,820
uh, I always say this like with nick, uh,

2050
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:25,240
yes ma'am. She, he'll, uh,
he'll coast or he'll, uh,

2051
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,510
with this camp he was coasting
and some of the rounds,

2052
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:30,670
or if I put him in there with
somebody that wasn't that hard,

2053
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:32,620
he would like not do so well.

2054
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:35,300
And then we just kind of go at the
level of the person he was going with.

2055
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,370
So I found that, that, uh, you know, I
would tell the people to hit him a lot,

2056
01:52:39,371 --> 01:52:42,750
fucking harder, almost try to piss
him off, talk shit to him. I tried,

2057
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:46,770
I tried my best, like Anderson Silva come
on, come on, like a impressions with, uh,

2058
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:49,820
when we were sparring, his kicking
was a lot better in this fight.

2059
01:52:49,821 --> 01:52:54,260
And we never seen it before. Was, is that
all, you know, there's a lot of people,

2060
01:52:54,261 --> 01:52:58,430
interviews people, some guy, some
interview guy, I forget which, who was,

2061
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:02,180
but he was like, you know, how do you
feel about this fight with nick? You know,

2062
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:06,620
looking at Nathan, Nate,
Nate's last performance, you
know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2063
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:10,580
Was trying to compare like Nate versus
[inaudible] major inducer good against

2064
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:13,750
[inaudible] then you know,
and I'm like how the Fed Samara,

2065
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:18,350
my math two fucking completely different
people. Two different opponents,

2066
01:53:18,351 --> 01:53:21,260
two different people, two different
weight classes. But uh, yeah,

2067
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:23,840
a lot of times when people have
complained to the, both of them don't,

2068
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:25,120
don't block kicks very well.

2069
01:53:25,121 --> 01:53:27,590
And their understanding of of
kickboxing is a little different.

2070
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:31,550
So like for me as a, as like a
coach, so to speak, in this camp,

2071
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:35,690
I was trying to put and bring in the best
possible sparring partners I could for

2072
01:53:35,691 --> 01:53:35,870
them.

2073
01:53:35,870 --> 01:53:39,290
So I brought it art some love and I
brought in Shitty and Connie was sparring

2074
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:42,470
with me. I believe in a lot.
I got a lot of flack for this.

2075
01:53:42,471 --> 01:53:45,110
I believe all three of those people are
better kickboxers that Anderson Silva

2076
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:50,430
being that they're kickboxers and
Anderson Silva as Ann Mei fighters.

2077
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:54,410
It's not a knock on Anderson Silva. I
just think that those are very high level.

2078
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:58,250
Um, well, it's just a reality. It's
reality. You know what I'm saying? I mean,

2079
01:53:58,251 --> 01:54:01,070
Anderson has had spectacular
striking moments in MMA,

2080
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:05,180
right when it comes to his actual real
world kickboxing experience. It's,

2081
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:09,410
it's fairly limited.
There's not nearly as many fights,

2082
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:14,210
especially in like worldclass competition.
But it was like,

2083
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,080
you know, uh, our team has
a very like, confident,

2084
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:22,750
like a head movement. He's like a
cold, very elusive, very sneaky,

2085
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:26,400
similar traits that Anderson
has, but at a higher level, um,

2086
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:28,100
I think I hit a lot harder than,

2087
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:30,710
than Anderson and am a little
more aggressive and you know,

2088
01:54:30,711 --> 01:54:34,700
whatever things that I do
well translated well and,

2089
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:37,220
and nick for as far as the
looks and the feelings.

2090
01:54:37,221 --> 01:54:40,730
And then what Judy and [inaudible],
he's got phenomenal movement.

2091
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:45,080
He looks similar to, um, Anderson. He, uh,

2092
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:47,840
he's got like four inch longer reach than,
or somebody has a very,

2093
01:54:47,841 --> 01:54:51,380
very similar movement patterns and the
things that he does. So my thing was,

2094
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:55,190
you know, and nick didn't necessarily
beat any of us in any of that,

2095
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:55,850
you know what I mean?

2096
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:59,990
But he got used to seeing those
situations so that when it happened,

2097
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:03,380
when Anderson through that spinning
heel kick, nick was prepared for it,

2098
01:55:03,381 --> 01:55:06,200
moved out of the way. Um, most of
the kicks he blocked, you know,

2099
01:55:06,201 --> 01:55:09,250
nick through a lot more kicks then
and he usually does his way more.

2100
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:13,610
His awareness of kickboxing, it showed,
you know, and that was, you know,

2101
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:14,750
I didn't know how to
fight was going to go,

2102
01:55:14,751 --> 01:55:19,751
but I knew that I felt a
lot of responsibility as far
as if nick got caught with

2103
01:55:19,851 --> 01:55:22,280
something, some kick or
some, some kickboxing move.

2104
01:55:22,281 --> 01:55:23,540
I felt like I was going to be my fault.

2105
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:26,720
But I didn't show him holding pads
with him. Totally fads for him.

2106
01:55:26,721 --> 01:55:30,830
Just so you were working
on this combinations like
that left leg kick was big.

2107
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:31,490
That was more,

2108
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:35,180
he landed more leg kicks on Anderson
than anybody had ever done before.

2109
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:38,480
If you go back and watch Anderson's
fights, nobody, nobody landed like that.

2110
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:40,910
That left leg kick over and over again.
He landed that,

2111
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:45,870
I don't think Anderson expected that.
Right. You know, Anderson stands southpaw,

2112
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:47,610
so that right leg is exposed.
And,

2113
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:51,750
and nick landed that left leg kick
over and over again. Yeah. Uh,

2114
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:53,860
there was something that we
had worked on was just him,

2115
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,830
him throwing kicks and being
more comfortable with kicks.

2116
01:55:55,831 --> 01:55:59,640
I've always tried to get him to kick
more, but it was something where, um,

2117
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,440
he's a lot more confident with his hands.

2118
01:56:01,441 --> 01:56:02,610
He's had more experience with his hands.

2119
01:56:02,611 --> 01:56:04,290
And then sometimes if
you don't kick enough,

2120
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:07,740
someone's making you forcing you
kick all the time and the gym,

2121
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,930
you get tired when you throw a kick.
You know,

2122
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:12,370
if I'm used to boxing all the time
and the throw one or two kicks, I've,

2123
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,370
it's like going for a
take down on their tires.

2124
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:18,180
So I wanted to make sure that
he felt, felt good. You know,

2125
01:56:18,181 --> 01:56:21,390
we worked on some elbows from the clinch.
I thought he did really well.

2126
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:23,100
I'm against Anderson in the clinch,

2127
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:26,670
especially if you look at like how
rich Franklin did. So, you know,

2128
01:56:26,671 --> 01:56:29,430
my goal wasn't to make
nick a high level kickbox.

2129
01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:33,370
It was just to make him his awareness
of kickboxing and his defense, you know?

2130
01:56:33,371 --> 01:56:36,450
And I think, I think it showed the, he
showed a lot, you know, I didn't know it.

2131
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,450
It definitely did.
Now does nick do any weight lifting?

2132
01:56:39,451 --> 01:56:42,870
Does he do any strength and conditioning
stuff for this fight? He did. Um,

2133
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,140
but again, it's not, was it
wasn't that heavy, but he,

2134
01:56:47,141 --> 01:56:48,510
he worked his way up and he did,

2135
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:52,630
he did start weightlifting for that
and I think he put on, you know,

2136
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:57,650
he still was like right around 201
it was walking around for the fight,

2137
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:01,050
you know, he was, he was by no
means like two oh five or to 10.

2138
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:05,160
That's still heavy for him. Made
a hit tool five. That's for him.

2139
01:57:05,161 --> 01:57:07,140
That's pretty heavy though,
isn't it? But yeah, it is.

2140
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:10,200
And I thought that like when the, when
fight week came and he cut the weight,

2141
01:57:10,201 --> 01:57:13,800
he had a pretty easy weight cut. I think
he dropped like 10 pounds of water, uh,

2142
01:57:13,850 --> 01:57:16,140
want to say he got in the
ring probably around one 95.

2143
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:20,100
But like you could see he was
definitely bigger than he was,

2144
01:57:20,101 --> 01:57:23,550
but it was like solid weight. It wasn't
like somebody blew up and you know,

2145
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:28,500
j pen fought Machita or something
like that, which all sloppy. Right.

2146
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:30,970
So is Nick gonna Compete
again or would it,

2147
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:33,090
what does this thoughts after this fight?
Uh,

2148
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:35,580
probably said it four times on
this show, Jill. I'll say it again.

2149
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:39,720
I really have no fucking idea what's
going on in his head. Uh, I hope he does.

2150
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:42,420
I think we, uh, you know,
there was some stuff that, uh,

2151
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:46,410
one of the problems that we had in the
fight was it was the first time I'd ever

2152
01:57:46,411 --> 01:57:50,430
cornered nick. And when I
was yelling stuff at him, he
didn't recognize my voice.

2153
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:53,250
So a lot of the stuff I was saying,
they told me after, he was like, oh,

2154
01:57:53,251 --> 01:57:57,690
that was you. And I was like, what
was it screaming fucking Portuguese?

2155
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:02,650
And was like, fuck, I didn't know if
that was, you know, and um, that's funny.

2156
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:06,480
Yeah. I think we could do even better.
And I think, um, I think you did great.

2157
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:09,630
I think he has some really
exciting matchups for him. Um,

2158
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,450
I'd like to see him rematch,
Carlos condit.

2159
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,650
I think that'd be a huge fight
will be great fun to watch.

2160
01:58:13,651 --> 01:58:17,610
I'd like to see him rematch. Uh, you know,
Robbie Lawler would be huge, you know,

2161
01:58:17,611 --> 01:58:20,550
maybe to Carlos and then that gives them
a title shot and maybe didn't give him

2162
01:58:20,551 --> 01:58:24,000
title shot. I don't really know. I'm
just guessing. I love those two fights.

2163
01:58:24,001 --> 01:58:27,390
I think jazzy, fantastic. After a
two year layoff or whatever it is,

2164
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:30,120
if he does decide to come back, I think
that's another awesome fight. You know,

2165
01:58:30,190 --> 01:58:33,060
Nick says he wants the big fights.
He's obviously a marquee fighter.

2166
01:58:33,061 --> 01:58:36,870
I think that there's a lot of uh,
really exciting. Matchups well,

2167
01:58:36,871 --> 01:58:39,330
I think this fight only
raised his profile so too,

2168
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:42,160
I think he did a fantastic
job against the greatest

2169
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,730
of all time.

2170
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:45,550
It means him and fade or those are the
two arguments or who's the greatest of

2171
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:50,200
all time? It's Anderson and Fado
and uh, you know, it's one of those,

2172
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:55,030
no, there's no right answer, you know,
fade or had some amazing fights in pride.

2173
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:57,970
And then, but the problem is
those guys that he fought,

2174
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,860
they came over from pride
and they fought in the UFC.

2175
01:58:59,861 --> 01:59:02,080
They didn't look nearly as good.
So what does that,

2176
01:59:02,081 --> 01:59:05,440
is that because fade or beat them up is
because they're not on steroids anymore?

2177
01:59:05,441 --> 01:59:09,160
Is it because they weren't that good in
the first place? Is it their shopworn?

2178
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:12,040
Is it the cage? Right. There's
all these different questions,

2179
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:14,350
but those are the two guys that,
in my opinion,

2180
01:59:14,351 --> 01:59:19,030
I go with Anderson because
it mostly because I've seen
him live and I think that

2181
01:59:19,031 --> 01:59:22,830
the level of competition that he faced
is probably a little higher, but it's,

2182
01:59:22,831 --> 01:59:24,330
it's an argument that I could see,
like,

2183
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:26,680
see when people say a fader was the
greatest of all time, I'm like, yeah,

2184
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:30,730
I could see your argument. You know? I
mean I'm not, I'm not 100% against it,

2185
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:34,570
but to go five rounds like nick did,

2186
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:39,640
being a guy who fought his original
career at one 55. Unbelievable, amazing.

2187
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:43,360
I mean you fuck fucking Diego Sanchez
at one 55 and he fought a lot.

2188
01:59:43,361 --> 01:59:47,080
Sean sherk one 55 and fights Anderson
30 pounds heavier and it's very

2189
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:47,914
competitive.

2190
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:51,220
They're seventh fight where somebody,

2191
01:59:51,221 --> 01:59:56,221
he is his opponent was either at one time
a UFC champion or went on to become a

2192
01:59:56,291 --> 02:00:00,430
UFC champion. He fought six or seven of
those guys in his career. That's amazing.

2193
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:03,700
That's amazing. Right. Was the thing up
to your face soap? So I hear you better.

2194
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,370
Sorry. And then when, uh, when
I was going through his, uh,

2195
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:10,780
I was looking at the opponents
and the strikers that, uh,

2196
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:12,460
Anderson had fought in his career.

2197
02:00:12,461 --> 02:00:15,220
Then I was looking at the strikers and
the opponents that naked fought and his

2198
02:00:15,221 --> 02:00:17,200
career.
And it was just for my own curiosity,

2199
02:00:17,201 --> 02:00:22,201
but like nick fought straight straight
would his words hitters and at their

2200
02:00:22,721 --> 02:00:26,380
best, you know, Paul Daley,
Paul Daley, when, uh,

2201
02:00:26,410 --> 02:00:29,830
Robbie Lawler was a monster,
you know, at his best when I'm,

2202
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:33,250
or now he's got a new best, I'm not
sure, but I think he's at his best.

2203
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:37,630
But then Chris Lytle, you
know, uh, a lot of like really,

2204
02:00:37,631 --> 02:00:41,640
really good strikers when they were,
you know, uh, the Japanese guy, uh,

2205
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:45,630
when he fought him in pride,
gummy gummy. Yeah. Jeez,

2206
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,630
go me was knocking the shit out everybody.

2207
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:51,190
And so nick has always taken those really
tough fights and whether people love

2208
02:00:51,191 --> 02:00:52,750
him or hate him,
no one can ever say that.

2209
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:55,390
Nick doesn't fought his way
to get where he is, you know?

2210
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:58,860
No doubt. It's really impressive. No,
he's a very good, very good fighter.

2211
02:00:58,890 --> 02:01:01,730
It's just one of those
things where I just,

2212
02:01:01,731 --> 02:01:04,590
I just feel like the right
now is a great time for him.

2213
02:01:04,591 --> 02:01:06,390
If he wants to like
follow through right now,

2214
02:01:06,391 --> 02:01:09,280
if you really want to remain active
and jump right back in there,

2215
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:11,070
there's so many marquee battles for him.

2216
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:14,490
I would love to see nick versus Hector
Lombard. You want to talk about PR?

2217
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:17,790
I mean what the fuck would happen with
the tax or Lumbar of nick starts talking

2218
02:01:17,791 --> 02:01:20,900
shit to him like that, you
know, and it's good fight too.

2219
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:23,010
Great Fight Hector's a monster

2220
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:25,250
and Matt Brown would be an awesome,

2221
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:29,120
there's a lot of really exciting fights
from at one 70 and I'm sure there are

2222
02:01:29,121 --> 02:01:31,190
some in one 85 as well.
Yeah.

2223
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:36,110
And if he's wants to do some good fights
and you know now that watching them

2224
02:01:36,111 --> 02:01:38,930
against Anderson Silva,
there's not really a way class.

2225
02:01:38,931 --> 02:01:40,110
I want to see him fight that.

2226
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,290
You know what I mean? Which
was heavy, heavy weight,

2227
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:44,810
but no higher than one of the
five. But all those guys. Yeah,

2228
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:47,810
I think he could go back and forth
between 70 and one five he wanted to,

2229
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,660
and it's funny that you know, people are
watching that fight and they're like, oh,

2230
02:01:50,661 --> 02:01:53,450
Anderson's, you know, that would,
let's see, Anderson retire,

2231
02:01:53,451 --> 02:01:54,680
he's not the same person anymore.

2232
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:58,620
Nobody's saying that about Nikka and
that's after a two year layoff. It's true.

2233
02:01:58,650 --> 02:02:00,050
She's really impressive.
Well,

2234
02:02:00,051 --> 02:02:03,650
people are concerned about Anderson
first of all that, you know,

2235
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,440
after the fight was over
to watch him like weeping.

2236
02:02:06,441 --> 02:02:09,910
Like that is also one of the reasons
why people concern. Right. You know,

2237
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:12,180
they're like Jesus Christ.
Like this is like the,

2238
02:02:12,181 --> 02:02:16,820
the pressure on this guy must have
been tremendous. Right? 39 years old.

2239
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:20,960
I've come back from, uh, from teen,
from knee surgeries before and like,

2240
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:22,300
that must have been such a relief,

2241
02:02:22,530 --> 02:02:26,570
a really challenging thing to come
back from all that. And you know,

2242
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:30,760
you know, maybe he wasn't crying
because he was, he said it was theirs.

2243
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:31,910
I don't know why he was crying,

2244
02:02:31,911 --> 02:02:35,360
but I'm sure that was a lot
emotional to go through, you know,

2245
02:02:35,361 --> 02:02:37,280
and to come back after being
knocked out and you know,

2246
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:39,530
basically humiliated and then
we're going to next fight again.

2247
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:43,240
Your leg shattered and you're out for
another year, you know? Yeah. It's a lot,

2248
02:02:43,241 --> 02:02:46,470
a lot of pressure on, on somebody and
maybe those are just tears of joy.

2249
02:02:46,471 --> 02:02:50,150
He was happy to, or pride or whatever
it was, you know? Right. Well,

2250
02:02:50,151 --> 02:02:53,900
the second fight that what disturbed
me wasn't even the leg snap.

2251
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:56,630
I mean the leg snap was disturbing,
but I'd seen that before.

2252
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:59,180
What disturbed me was how easy
it went down in the clinch.

2253
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,740
He got clenched up and Weidman hit him
on the right hand and it's like his body

2254
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:05,630
just gave out. And I was
like, I don't like that.

2255
02:03:05,631 --> 02:03:09,380
Because if you go back and you
watch Anderson's younger days,

2256
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:14,060
he took a fucking tremendous punch.
You go back, watch him versus uh,

2257
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:16,580
uh, what's it Jorge Alovera. Yeah.

2258
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:21,950
And he gets cracked with Jorge Rivera.

2259
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:26,720
It was Jorge Rivera, not Oliver. Uh,
George Rivera. Yeah, Jorge. Right.

2260
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:31,400
He caught whatever he calls it. It
was a big puncher. He's a big puncher.

2261
02:03:31,401 --> 02:03:35,420
And Anderson like stood in front of him
and let him tee off on him. It was weird.

2262
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:39,710
And then he was like smiling at him and
then, and then fucked him up afterwards.

2263
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,450
And I'll tell the Lee Marie fight,

2264
02:03:41,451 --> 02:03:45,470
he got tagged by Lee Marie and when he
marries a fucking murderous puncher, fine,

2265
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:49,370
no, you know, no problems at
all. It's just one of those
things where when it goes,

2266
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:51,800
it goes, yeah, that's true.

2267
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:56,940
And that was something else that we
were looking at like in the and the uh,

2268
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:59,720
and the camp, you know,
are looking at, you know,

2269
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:03,800
we're obviously concerned that of a
hell nick was getting reacting to clench

2270
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:08,150
with, um, with innocent after
seeing Anderson's fight with
rich Franklin, you know,

2271
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:11,390
and then watching the fight over
again with Weidman and I was like,

2272
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,920
I want you to punch from there.

2273
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:15,710
Just start throwing punches and cross
space to get out of that. Clinton,

2274
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:17,473
you see how,

2275
02:04:17,790 --> 02:04:21,330
how easily nick was able to get out of
it and how well it worked for Weidman.

2276
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,900
It was like with Rick,
with a rich Franklin,

2277
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:28,460
he had really no idea what to do there,
you know? So yeah. It's interesting. Yeah.

2278
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,800
Rich was at a loss when it came to that.
He,

2279
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:35,130
he know he's a very tough guy and
a very well, well conditioned guy,

2280
02:04:35,131 --> 02:04:38,040
but I don't think it was
the most technical when it
came to certain aspects of

2281
02:04:38,041 --> 02:04:41,140
fighting. But he was at a different, he
came up in a different era, you know?

2282
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:42,061
And that was,

2283
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:45,690
that was my goal when it came to like
bringing in the sparring partners and

2284
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:46,890
putting them in those situations.

2285
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:50,670
Rich Franklin obviously is capable of
doing a lot of different things in that

2286
02:04:50,671 --> 02:04:52,310
clinch.
He just had never been in that situation.

2287
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:54,510
His training partners didn't expect it or,

2288
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:56,340
or what hadn't been prepared him for that.

2289
02:04:56,341 --> 02:05:00,290
So once Anderson hits you with a few
of those knees, you're kind of fucked.

2290
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:04,440
Oh yeah. Yeah. And then, uh, you know
what you're going to do makes it,

2291
02:05:04,441 --> 02:05:06,650
if no one's ever taught you anything
other, it was like, oh shit, I'll need me.

2292
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:09,600
They're getting them back.
It's place. So, yeah,

2293
02:05:09,601 --> 02:05:12,780
he didn't know how to control the hips.
He didn't know what to do and it just,

2294
02:05:12,781 --> 02:05:15,120
you know, that was, that
was, he was new school.

2295
02:05:15,121 --> 02:05:19,080
He was like the new era in like 2003.
That's what Franklin was.

2296
02:05:19,081 --> 02:05:22,230
He was like the new era of
athletes supreme. We conditioned,

2297
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:26,250
I remember they used to show on those
countdown shows, these show his training.

2298
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:29,190
Right. You know, his workout
routine. It was brutal.

2299
02:05:29,490 --> 02:05:32,340
I mean nobody worked out back
then as hard as rich Franklin.

2300
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:33,810
He was huge for one 85.

2301
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:38,580
What was that Hawaiian League he used
to fight in before UFC was like a super

2302
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:43,350
bro. He was like two 25 champion.
He's a heavyweight. He was a big guy,

2303
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:48,060
big guy. It's really fic. And uh, when he
went down to one 85, you mean he was a,

2304
02:05:48,061 --> 02:05:49,600
it was a struggle there.

2305
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:53,490
The first few fights at one 85 before he
figured out how to dial it in perfectly.

2306
02:05:53,491 --> 02:05:55,390
It was a struggle.
It's a,

2307
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:58,020
that's the weird thing about what
we were talking about before,

2308
02:05:58,021 --> 02:06:02,640
the weight cutting. Like what, what's
too much? What's not enough? Yeah.

2309
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,530
You know, and then he, you know,

2310
02:06:04,531 --> 02:06:07,770
he was the guy to retire chocolate
Dell at two oh five so it's, you know,

2311
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:09,260
nobody saw that coming.
Right.

2312
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:12,570
You ever thought that rich Franklin
was gonna knock chocolate, Dell dead?

2313
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:16,080
You know who, who thought that was going
to happen? What a weird fluke shot.

2314
02:06:16,130 --> 02:06:18,870
Not a fluke.
I mean obviously probably meant to do it,

2315
02:06:18,871 --> 02:06:20,100
but the way that chuck went down,

2316
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:23,700
it wasn't like you seen chuck get hit
with way harder shots for that. Yeah.

2317
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:26,910
That was just a sign. You know, like
once you, once it's gone, it's gone.

2318
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,140
He got tagged earlier in the round two
that I think contributed to that and he

2319
02:06:31,141 --> 02:06:31,500
got,

2320
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:35,700
he got hit with some big shots earlier
in the round where you could see like he

2321
02:06:35,701 --> 02:06:37,320
got dinged.
You know,

2322
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:41,400
Dana and I actually talked about it
before and he said he felt like chuck was

2323
02:06:41,401 --> 02:06:44,040
hurt early in the round and you know,

2324
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:47,880
that was just the one that just put
them away was the one that that landed.

2325
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:51,100
It was crazy that rich was, he hit
him with a broken arm, you know,

2326
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:54,330
he hit him with a right hand and then
after the right hand he hit him with his

2327
02:06:54,331 --> 02:06:58,470
left and his left had been snapped
earlier in the fight. He didn't even,

2328
02:06:59,210 --> 02:07:01,560
you know, just threw punches,
didn't even realize it.

2329
02:07:01,561 --> 02:07:04,140
And after the fight he realizes,
Oh shit fucks going on with this thing.

2330
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:07,110
That's a common thing.

2331
02:07:07,111 --> 02:07:11,530
And kickboxing though isn't it like
blocking those kicks on the forum taken

2332
02:07:11,550 --> 02:07:15,120
kicks on. The arm is uh, there's a,
there's a way he can do it though,

2333
02:07:15,121 --> 02:07:17,110
like a lot of people. Um, and that was,

2334
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:19,350
I think it was explained
to nick and this campus.

2335
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:24,590
Somebody along the line told Nick to
block like you're holding pads this way.

2336
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:29,040
So that's like exposes your skin.
This is like exposes your,

2337
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:31,980
your for like the bone on bone.
If you keep this inside,

2338
02:07:31,981 --> 02:07:34,670
you're going to take it on like the
meat of the arm, the meat of your,

2339
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:36,460
your other arm.
And then you put one hand here.

2340
02:07:36,461 --> 02:07:39,460
So this doesn't hurt nearly
as bad as going here.

2341
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:44,150
It's bone on bone. And the Shin
is going to win against the owner,

2342
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:45,700
whatever button every time.

2343
02:07:46,510 --> 02:07:50,860
It's so weird when you watch a guys
shit get broken like the Tyrone Spong

2344
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:54,420
[inaudible] Saki fight. Especially when
a guy likes bong. It's just such a,

2345
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:55,360
such a high level.

2346
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:59,470
Kickboxer you watched him throw a kick
and then you see his leg just go noodle,

2347
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:04,360
just snap. And then,
uh, I think, uh, Jerome,

2348
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:09,361
the banner had broke [inaudible] arm
back in k one once in the past two,

2349
02:08:09,451 --> 02:08:09,910
so,

2350
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:13,660
well remember when [inaudible] fought
against Alistair Overeem and the finals?

2351
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:16,120
His arm was shot. Yeah.
That's what it was.

2352
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:21,470
He got hit and his arm was fucked up
before, you know, that fight even started.

2353
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:25,390
He threw like one more kick everything
off. Yeah. He was done at arms done. Yeah.

2354
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:30,730
The bones to just nothing, nothing
that makes them any tougher than that.

2355
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:31,300
You know,

2356
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:35,080
you're born with a certain amount of bone
density and you could lift weights and

2357
02:08:35,081 --> 02:08:37,240
they'll get thicker and a
little bit stronger. But,

2358
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:41,160
so someone was telling me
that they, cause usually, uh,

2359
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,860
all of the guys that I can remember that
I've seen with it breaking their legs

2360
02:08:44,861 --> 02:08:47,050
were always black guys.
You know, this, this wow,

2361
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:50,410
somebody was telling me that I think
you can Google it, that there is a, uh,

2362
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:53,590
there was actually studied them by it,
that um,

2363
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:58,720
if vitamin D I think it's d three, like
something that we get from the sun, um,

2364
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:02,820
the darker skin people have like a, almost
like a filter of it and they don't, um,

2365
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:06,900
they don't, uh, don't absorb as
much, absorb as much as it and,

2366
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,960
but it was like Corey Hill tireless and
long and he said Sova Danny Beal back in

2367
02:09:12,101 --> 02:09:14,120
the day, like almost every
person I can think of the head,

2368
02:09:14,121 --> 02:09:16,840
their lakes snapped and
kickboxing was this black guy.

2369
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:20,920
I've definitely seen white guys online
get their leg snapped and kickboxing.

2370
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:23,680
I'm sure white white dudes are
just as vulnerable. Had the guy,

2371
02:09:24,150 --> 02:09:27,010
I thought somebody told me that and I
googled it and then sure enough there was

2372
02:09:27,011 --> 02:09:29,710
like a study done on it
that it works like a,

2373
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:33,700
you're darker skin tone works as like
a filter and you don't absorb as much.

2374
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:37,600
I think it was d three that's weird
because I guess you know the more melanin

2375
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:42,010
acts as like sunscreen. It was melanin.
Something like that's interesting.

2376
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,930
I don't know about all that
and I couldn't believe it.

2377
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:49,320
Joe Rogan's like Joe Schilling gold
throws out facts and that's what everybody

2378
02:09:49,781 --> 02:09:52,900
does in ratio though. I do it all
the time, but I think that like,

2379
02:09:52,901 --> 02:09:54,400
but I did Google that one I want.
It's true,

2380
02:09:54,610 --> 02:09:58,810
but African Americans tend to
have thicker bone density. See,

2381
02:09:58,811 --> 02:10:02,140
I think it was the exact opposite
is what that says. That's not true.

2382
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:06,400
They definitely have more bone density
because in fact African American women

2383
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:10,540
tend to have the same,
a similar bone density as European males.

2384
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:16,210
Brilliant. Yeah. Yeah. Africans have a
thicker bone density Africans in general,

2385
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:20,370
but you got to realize that that varies
with strength training. Like when,

2386
02:10:20,371 --> 02:10:22,630
when they do that with people,
a lot of times they're,

2387
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:25,930
you're not testing people that are
lifting weights. When you lift weights,

2388
02:10:25,931 --> 02:10:29,230
your bone density increases dramatically,

2389
02:10:29,530 --> 02:10:34,100
especially with people who do like power
lifting and you're like, their fucking

2390
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,910
jaws get wider. You know, their head
gets thicker and it's because your body,

2391
02:10:37,911 --> 02:10:41,040
your whole body is dealing with,
there's a little bit of that going on too.

2392
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:48,200
But even if your natural
just carrying that, you know,

2393
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:53,000
just lifting very heavy things forces
your body to go, oh, this motherfucker,

2394
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:56,840
what are we doing with our body here? You
know, your body's pretty adaptable man.

2395
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:58,910
I mean,
you look at people that are Yogis,

2396
02:10:58,911 --> 02:11:02,270
it can get in all these crazy positions
and they're not born that way.

2397
02:11:02,570 --> 02:11:06,950
They're just slowly stretching
themselves into that position, you know?

2398
02:11:06,951 --> 02:11:09,650
And that's,
that's the flexibility of your muscles.

2399
02:11:09,651 --> 02:11:14,030
It's the density of your bones
that the body will adapt to stress.

2400
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:15,320
The more you give it,

2401
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:19,490
the more it sort of tried to conform to
this new work that you're asking it to

2402
02:11:19,491 --> 02:11:22,310
do by then like kicking pads and like,

2403
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:26,300
oh yeah sure our phones get
thicker. Oh yeah, like the micro,

2404
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:29,010
micro whatever. Well they also say, um,

2405
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:31,940
when you're kicking like
Shin on Shin all the time,

2406
02:11:31,941 --> 02:11:34,340
what you're also doing is you get these,

2407
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:39,430
the posits of blood and it fills up and
calcifies and you know all the bruises.

2408
02:11:40,431 --> 02:11:43,280
When it heals those
microfractures and tiny,

2409
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:45,530
you're getting all this calcification,

2410
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:50,690
it almost leads to like a Shin instep
protector, you know, all over your Shin.

2411
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:54,660
Like do you ever see that fight in lion
fight or mallow pet just starts, uh, he,

2412
02:11:54,670 --> 02:11:59,310
he kicks his guy and you see the guy
react and so he just starts going Shin to

2413
02:11:59,311 --> 02:12:01,490
sham with them just winging his shins.

2414
02:12:01,491 --> 02:12:04,040
And I'm laughing at the
guy cause Malpass shins.

2415
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:08,420
It's been known since he was like six and
he's got over like 400 fights I think.

2416
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:12,790
Yeah. Ridiculous nuts. But it's almost
like he's got armor on his shins.

2417
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:15,800
He just smashing them into the other
guy shins and laughing at him while he's

2418
02:12:15,801 --> 02:12:19,790
doing that because his shins all
just fucking covered this, this,

2419
02:12:19,791 --> 02:12:24,350
this layer of protection that's
been built up like knuckles,

2420
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:28,550
like those dudes, those co Karate
Maki Wara guys I had to go constantly.

2421
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:32,060
There's lots of,
does that fuck your hands up though?

2422
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:34,160
Cause I would think that like,
I would think so.

2423
02:12:34,161 --> 02:12:37,100
I mean I used to tell him all the time
like bro you were, we work gloves,

2424
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:39,140
wrap your hands.
The fuck is the point of that shit.

2425
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:41,910
Like kick that thing cause you've got to
do it. Like what the fuck are you doing?

2426
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:44,840
You know? But he was like on
some like Samurai type shit.

2427
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:50,290
Well his knuckles were just be like
just crazy calcified me my up pretty big

2428
02:12:51,561 --> 02:12:53,860
knuckles now too. But I don't, I don't,

2429
02:12:54,410 --> 02:12:56,740
I would think that like your
hand would not work properly.

2430
02:12:56,750 --> 02:12:59,570
Got Arthritis and shit. That's what
I'm looking to be worried about.

2431
02:12:59,571 --> 02:13:02,600
The arthritis. My friend
John, he used to do that shit.

2432
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:05,420
He used to break bricks and those
karate demonstrations and Shit,

2433
02:13:05,421 --> 02:13:09,140
but he would always practice like
hitting the Maki Warrah and his, uh,

2434
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,930
which is a mock, your war is just like
this for folks who don't understand.

2435
02:13:11,931 --> 02:13:16,360
It's like a two by four that's wrapped
with rope and they, they, you know,

2436
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:21,020
lock it into the ground so it's real stiff
and they would pound this two by four

2437
02:13:21,021 --> 02:13:25,670
with a rope until you develop all
this calcification and all this, um,

2438
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:26,650
this,
uh,

2439
02:13:26,650 --> 02:13:30,680
calluses all over the top of your
knuckle where it's like one big knuckle.

2440
02:13:30,681 --> 02:13:32,040
The first knuckles become

2441
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,820
one big giant knuckle.
But does that help your hands?

2442
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:40,310
I protect you from getting
injured. I don't, I don't know.

2443
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:41,610
It seems like it would,

2444
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,450
I think most of the time that Andrea
is a happen in boxing or fighting is

2445
02:13:45,451 --> 02:13:49,500
usually these bones, the
small ones towards the pinky
and the next finger, right?

2446
02:13:49,501 --> 02:13:52,590
Yeah. They're not protected as
much. Well, like this is actually,

2447
02:13:52,591 --> 02:13:54,360
if you break this and
you go to the doctor,

2448
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:56,080
they're going to call
it a boxer's fractures.

2449
02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:00,410
I broke mine when I was kid.
But these are usually the bones of break,

2450
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:03,910
but usually they say like you want to
hit with these two bones that cause these

2451
02:14:03,911 --> 02:14:06,280
two buttons line up
directly with your wrist.

2452
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:10,550
These two are like kind of on an angle.
So it's a lot easier to break these. Yeah.

2453
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:14,350
Yeah. Especially considering
like how your hands built.

2454
02:14:14,351 --> 02:14:16,780
Like some people they
have a more narrow hand.

2455
02:14:16,810 --> 02:14:19,540
Maybe it would be more
protected by the outside edge,

2456
02:14:19,541 --> 02:14:23,770
but mine's sticks out on the side.
Yeah. It's like a weird thing man.

2457
02:14:23,771 --> 02:14:25,320
The hands just not
designed to punch people.

2458
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:26,990
Speaking of which like
Nick's is not really,

2459
02:14:26,991 --> 02:14:30,260
nick has like this crazy
not right here on his,

2460
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:33,110
I just saw it the other day and it was
on both of those and like what the fuck

2461
02:14:33,111 --> 02:14:33,480
is it

2462
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:37,380
probably broken and never did anything
about it. That is nut probably broke it.

2463
02:14:37,740 --> 02:14:38,670
Just let it get me a lot.

2464
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:43,230
It sounds like this crazy lifted up thing
like right here in the center of his

2465
02:14:43,231 --> 02:14:46,350
hands on his hands.
That's probably not good.

2466
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:49,530
That guy's got some scar tissue.

2467
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:51,990
He's got some cars that she's
been through some fucking wars.

2468
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:56,130
But look at you man, looking
beautiful. 31 years of age. Look, I me,

2469
02:14:56,131 --> 02:14:59,010
if people didn't know you,
they would never think you're
a professional. Kickboxer

2470
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:02,440
that's true. I've had a few
cuts and scratches. I've got uh,

2471
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:07,480
both of my own, both sides of my
eyes that have cut under both eyes,

2472
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:08,980
never broke my nose.

2473
02:15:08,981 --> 02:15:12,400
All those Simon Marcus and I think
our first flight he had slammed me,

2474
02:15:12,401 --> 02:15:15,190
like trip me and like landed
on top of me and knocked me.

2475
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:19,030
I was out of it and stand
up and I'm walking the wrong
direction and the ref was

2476
02:15:19,031 --> 02:15:22,000
a plantation and said fight and I
just got blasted like two more times.

2477
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:25,040
But after that fight, like one of,
one of the things he finished him,

2478
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:27,730
it was like a push kick to the face.
And after that fight,

2479
02:15:27,731 --> 02:15:31,600
like all of the cartilage inside my nose,
like this ball or whatever is not,

2480
02:15:31,850 --> 02:15:34,550
doesn't sit right anymore. It's like
a little crooked because of this.

2481
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,710
I can't fix it.

2482
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:37,620
Does it breathe? Can you
breathe in? You know,

2483
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,440
I read that the both though.
That's good,

2484
02:15:39,441 --> 02:15:42,860
but it's like if I stick my finger in
this part of this space and like this one,

2485
02:15:42,861 --> 02:15:46,610
there's like a ball in there where he
just kind of rearranged my cartilage,

2486
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:51,430
gave me a nose job and
knocked him out. Or even,

2487
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:56,420
well, the last fight is the
fight. That's the most important.
Right, right. You know,

2488
02:15:56,450 --> 02:15:58,850
if you had knocked him out the first time,
then he'd beat me a few times.

2489
02:15:58,950 --> 02:16:03,140
He wouldn't feel so even, yeah, we
were talking about taking punches.

2490
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:05,150
I need to put him on blast or no,
he uh,

2491
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:09,740
after I was the first person to knock
about and he was 39 and o or it's super

2492
02:16:09,741 --> 02:16:12,700
impressive record, you
know, it was awesome. Um,

2493
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:17,360
but he just fought in China I think a
week or two ago and he got dropped like

2494
02:16:17,361 --> 02:16:20,210
three or four times and finish
like he can take a punch anymore.

2495
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:23,300
Like we haven't really affected it as a

2496
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:28,730
fan, as some Chinese guy. I don't
remember. Just say, Oh shit.

2497
02:16:28,731 --> 02:16:30,670
If say look up Simon Marcus,

2498
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:33,370
that's, that's important.
That's really incredible.

2499
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:36,760
When you think about the fact that he
did have that amazing record coming into

2500
02:16:36,761 --> 02:16:37,600
that fight with you,

2501
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:41,020
that fucking righthand that you
landed on him was so perfect.

2502
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:45,880
It was so perfect to watch him fucking
just drop like you guys shot by a sniper,

2503
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:49,240
you know, to the front of all the
people in la. You know it's gotta.

2504
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:51,340
I to tell you that before
that that can't stop.

2505
02:16:51,341 --> 02:16:56,320
Crazy is fun until you have
someone fucking yelling it
over and over behind you

2506
02:16:56,321 --> 02:16:57,760
here.
Why are you trying to watch the fights?

2507
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:02,690
I was watching the fights and
some chick was yelling crazy.

2508
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:05,950
Like fucking relax honey.
Okay.

2509
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:10,090
We heard it the first 30 times she did
allude to the cap cap yelling at while

2510
02:17:10,091 --> 02:17:14,380
you were fighting. Really
can't stop crazy. I Dunno.
Just trying to get on camera.

2511
02:17:14,510 --> 02:17:17,110
I don't know what it was. That's
awesome. There's quite obnoxious,

2512
02:17:17,111 --> 02:17:20,260
I mean it was obnoxious but awesome that
you have that kind of supports. Awesome.

2513
02:17:20,261 --> 02:17:23,260
Out of that kind of support put dude when
he went down that place with deafening

2514
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:28,000
cause he's in your hometown in La. That
was wild shit. It was such an incredible,

2515
02:17:28,001 --> 02:17:31,920
I mean I, I'm used to get him before
glory came along. I was fighting it man.

2516
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:36,760
I had some pretty bit lion fight. That's
a big shows when um, uh, the hard rock,

2517
02:17:36,761 --> 02:17:39,520
but for the most part it was like
Hollywood Park Casino, you know,

2518
02:17:39,521 --> 02:17:44,060
1200 people to be at the
forum and like walking out.

2519
02:17:44,061 --> 02:17:47,050
Usually I walk out and I'm like
tunnel vision. I don't see the fans.

2520
02:17:47,051 --> 02:17:49,180
I'm just focusing on one of them too.
I like when I walked out for that,

2521
02:17:49,181 --> 02:17:51,520
like the ovation from all of
the fans was like, it was,

2522
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:52,840
it kind of chokes me up a little bit.

2523
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:56,800
I had to like take a breath and
like blow kisses to the fans.

2524
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:59,860
I had to do something just to
show my appreciation. It was,

2525
02:17:59,890 --> 02:18:02,600
it was really overwhelming. It was
an awesome environment. Managed.

2526
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:06,160
The forum was so packed and
it was so intense and it was,

2527
02:18:06,161 --> 02:18:10,030
everybody was also recognizing that
this was a big moment for kickboxing,

2528
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:14,110
kickboxing. You know, I've been to a
bunch of smokers and I've been to some,

2529
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:18,730
some probe matches in La and around
the area was always, they were small.

2530
02:18:18,910 --> 02:18:21,820
It wasn't that, you know, well
received. It wasn't that big of a deal.

2531
02:18:21,821 --> 02:18:26,800
But man this was a giant deal. All of this
spike TV cameras, you know, everybody,

2532
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:29,860
people being interviewed and the
whole deal it was like it was,

2533
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:33,280
there was so much energy behind it that
like everybody was realizing wow this

2534
02:18:33,281 --> 02:18:35,380
might and the fact that there's
a big pay per view card,

2535
02:18:35,730 --> 02:18:40,120
like this might be a big
moment where kickboxing becomes
just like MMA, you know,

2536
02:18:40,121 --> 02:18:42,070
becomes like this next level sport.

2537
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:45,730
Cause I'd always had like when you
look at the level of competition,

2538
02:18:45,731 --> 02:18:47,680
like when MMA became huge,

2539
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:52,430
the level of competition was not nearly
as high as where the level of kickboxing

2540
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:55,030
competition is right now.
The level is very high.

2541
02:18:55,270 --> 02:18:58,500
Like the Nikki Holt Skins and
the, you know, the, the, the,

2542
02:18:58,501 --> 02:19:02,010
the guys that are at the very
top of the list. There's this,

2543
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:07,070
this level that's like a real solid
world championship world class level.

2544
02:19:08,590 --> 02:19:13,130
We're, the MMA wasn't really there in
2005 when it went in merged. It's like,

2545
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:17,080
it's like all the pieces are in
place. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2546
02:19:17,081 --> 02:19:21,640
Well that's like tough guys. They
weren't the skillset. Yeah. But we'll,

2547
02:19:21,641 --> 02:19:22,810
we'll go back to rich Franklin.

2548
02:19:22,811 --> 02:19:26,410
I mean rich friend goes a
very good fighter but like
the difference between like

2549
02:19:26,411 --> 02:19:28,010
rich of,

2550
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:32,330
you know the, the rich Franklin, the
fought Anderson Silva and say like, um,

2551
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:36,140
you know like one of the like mighty
mouse Johnson who was in my opinion,

2552
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:40,370
the most technically sound fighter like
that mother fucker is worldclass at

2553
02:19:40,371 --> 02:19:44,180
everything he does. Everything he does
is perfect. You've got that, you know,

2554
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:46,640
like we'd mark to bond
to you got that with you.

2555
02:19:46,641 --> 02:19:50,360
You got that with the
elite kickboxers of today.

2556
02:19:50,660 --> 02:19:55,640
Whereas I don't think MMA had that when
it started to take off. So like if like,

2557
02:19:55,641 --> 02:19:58,520
if the promotion was behind
it and if they just, if,

2558
02:19:58,570 --> 02:20:01,760
if it caught on with the American
people and the names started getting

2559
02:20:01,761 --> 02:20:06,350
established, you know, Joe Schilling and
all these guys and you know, these, these,

2560
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:10,970
these names became more established
and it became something that became,

2561
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:14,540
you know, mainstream. I just think
like the, the quality's there,

2562
02:20:14,690 --> 02:20:15,800
the product is there,

2563
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:18,380
it's all just a matter of
promoting it and getting people to,

2564
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:21,260
that's the other thing that Dana said
when I was trying to get them to buy it.

2565
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:22,820
Like way back in the day,
they're like, you know what?

2566
02:20:22,821 --> 02:20:27,650
Americans were so poisoned
by like PKA karate, you know,

2567
02:20:27,651 --> 02:20:31,970
that they just have this idea in their
head is like, it's just dog shit. Right.

2568
02:20:31,971 --> 02:20:32,491
You know,
like the,

2569
02:20:32,491 --> 02:20:36,260
like when guys would throw like a bunch
of flippy kicks just to get the kicks in

2570
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:41,060
and you know, you have to throw like five,
six around or whatever after that. Yeah.

2571
02:20:41,061 --> 02:20:45,080
It was like, it was a weird time. It
just wasn't the same. It's like the,

2572
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:50,240
the level just wasn't the same. It's
not like what you see today. You know,

2573
02:20:50,241 --> 02:20:50,600
like what,

2574
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:53,900
what you see today when you see they're
throwing kicks cause the kicks are

2575
02:20:53,901 --> 02:20:57,830
effective. Like, like Raymond Daniels.
I mean that guy is throwing some wild,

2576
02:20:57,831 --> 02:20:59,870
crazy shit.
You know Daniel Gita,

2577
02:21:00,110 --> 02:21:02,960
he's throwing some fucking
powerful fucking kicks.

2578
02:21:02,961 --> 02:21:06,980
That's what's really exciting about the
kickbox if we were talking to the day,

2579
02:21:06,981 --> 02:21:11,490
but there's, there's the heavyweight
division and MMA right now is uh,

2580
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:15,260
it's lacking compared to
the other divisions, right?

2581
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:17,630
When you look at kickboxing heavyweights,

2582
02:21:17,690 --> 02:21:20,960
you got guys like digital Kita
who's like six [inaudible] five,

2583
02:21:20,961 --> 02:21:25,961
like 245 pounds through an heg kicks
him punch speed of like a middle weight.

2584
02:21:26,291 --> 02:21:29,810
You know, Rico Verhoeven like
the heavyweights and kickboxing.

2585
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:33,200
You got guys that are like six, five
and they're still throwing head kicks.

2586
02:21:33,201 --> 02:21:34,580
They don't move like Tim Silvia,

2587
02:21:34,581 --> 02:21:37,730
they don't like these MMA guys are
used to seeing. And it's just really,

2588
02:21:37,731 --> 02:21:41,810
really exciting stuff. Like Rico
Verhoeven is incredibly athletic. He, uh,

2589
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:46,760
he's a sparring partner with uh,
with, uh, shit, I forget his name. Um,

2590
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:48,890
really high level boxers and a Europe.

2591
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:53,720
And then a aerial Zimmerman is just a
knockout artist from, from the k one days.

2592
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:57,380
He fought all the top guys in k one
it's just really, really exciting stuff.

2593
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:01,150
And Rico Verhoeven is conditioning.
Yeah. I mean for heavyweight,

2594
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:04,520
he's a lot like Cain and that sense to
where that guy just does not get tired.

2595
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:07,040
I mean, he will go
five, 5 million or five,

2596
02:22:07,041 --> 02:22:09,740
three minute rounds and
be 100% through the,

2597
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:11,660
and that's where he beat Daniel Gita.

2598
02:22:11,661 --> 02:22:15,790
I think he started wearing them down and
then the conditioning sorta took in me.

2599
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:19,880
He can fight at a very high level for
a long time. And he's a young guy too.

2600
02:22:19,881 --> 02:22:24,030
He's got a, he's got a
bright future. I don't know.

2601
02:22:24,210 --> 02:22:26,130
I think he's 20 I'm sorry,
26

2602
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:31,110
at most. Yeah. Yeah. It's
um, what's it say here?

2603
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:34,860
And he's a huge guy. You know, when, when
you're next to him, like he's huge hands.

2604
02:22:34,861 --> 02:22:36,720
Like he's just a big giant,
giant man.

2605
02:22:36,890 --> 02:22:40,650
Yeah. I just hope it takes off, man.
I really do because I think I like,

2606
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:45,500
I do enjoy boxing. I'm a big boxing
fan, but I like kickboxing a lot more.

2607
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:49,370
Like I will watch kickboxing fights over
and over again. I will rewatch them.

2608
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:53,030
Where I think the more elements
you add two to fighting,

2609
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:57,800
the more interesting it becomes I law.
I actually kind of wish it was more tie,

2610
02:22:58,070 --> 02:23:01,730
you know? I think that the clinching
is an important aspect of it.

2611
02:23:01,731 --> 02:23:06,240
The tying up the knees to the body and
in the dumps. I think those that's,

2612
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:10,250
that's an important part of the art that
I and also the elbows and knees in the

2613
02:23:10,251 --> 02:23:13,700
clinch. I mean I think they're very
important. That's why I love malign fight.

2614
02:23:13,980 --> 02:23:17,430
Well and Kevin Ross is your guy, right?
Train with him on my best friends. Yeah.

2615
02:23:17,510 --> 02:23:19,760
I love that guy.
I love watching him fight too.

2616
02:23:19,790 --> 02:23:22,640
He's a pure Moitai like
you watch him fight every,

2617
02:23:22,670 --> 02:23:25,190
I mean the way he controls distance,

2618
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:28,430
the distance between the throwing the
kicks and the punches in that like he's

2619
02:23:28,431 --> 02:23:30,410
doing everything the right way.

2620
02:23:30,411 --> 02:23:33,770
Where like the right technique for
the right distance. It's all like,

2621
02:23:33,771 --> 02:23:35,150
it's a beautiful thing to watch.

2622
02:23:35,151 --> 02:23:39,300
You get to see the true art of Moitai
represented when he's fighting. You know?

2623
02:23:39,310 --> 02:23:42,800
Absolutely. Absolutely. They think
that's, I think that's missing in,

2624
02:23:42,850 --> 02:23:44,360
in a little bit in Gloria.
I'm like,

2625
02:23:44,361 --> 02:23:48,830
I think I wish they would go with the
elbows and the knees and letting guys tie

2626
02:23:48,831 --> 02:23:50,780
up in the clinch and
throw knees to the body.

2627
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:51,560
I think their,

2628
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:55,280
their thought process with the
clinches that it turns to some guys,

2629
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:59,690
it turns into like a way of stalling or
with like, you can't punch with them.

2630
02:23:59,691 --> 02:24:01,910
You can't, you're not as
good at punching and kicking.

2631
02:24:01,911 --> 02:24:03,310
So you just clinch him up and then,
you know,

2632
02:24:03,410 --> 02:24:06,350
it ends up being like a wrestling match.
What they're saying.

2633
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:09,500
I think they're silly. I think my two
fights with seven Marcus. Absolutely.

2634
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:12,630
Well Simon Mark is, that is
his style, right? That was,

2635
02:24:12,660 --> 02:24:15,570
that was one of the reasons
why he beat so many guys.

2636
02:24:15,571 --> 02:24:19,920
He's clinch was phenomenal and he was
so physically strong. Right. You know,

2637
02:24:20,730 --> 02:24:23,850
how much of a difference did you feel
fighting him in a Moitai fight and

2638
02:24:23,851 --> 02:24:25,890
fighting him in glory?

2639
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:29,850
Um, I didn't really notice
that much of a difference,

2640
02:24:29,851 --> 02:24:33,870
to be honest with you because I was in
a lot better shape and for the A and lot

2641
02:24:33,871 --> 02:24:36,150
more prepared for the,
for the last man standing thing.

2642
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:38,460
But I think it also forced him.
He had to,

2643
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:41,850
he wasn't able to hold on the way he
wanted to and to do what he wanted to do.

2644
02:24:41,851 --> 02:24:46,620
So I think it's unfair for me to
say it if it was, I don't know.

2645
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:49,690
That was a really good fun. I
enjoy it. It's great fight for you.

2646
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:54,240
I really liked and I always thought
that a glory rules with elbows would be

2647
02:24:54,241 --> 02:24:55,870
really interesting.
Like even if he didn't allow the clench,

2648
02:24:55,871 --> 02:24:58,920
but you're loud elbows because elbows
are actually my favorite weapon.

2649
02:24:58,921 --> 02:25:00,370
That's how I got my,
my ring name.

2650
02:25:00,371 --> 02:25:03,990
Most of my first 10 knockouts were by
elbow or from like knee to the head.

2651
02:25:03,991 --> 02:25:06,280
From the clinch. Yeah. I
think it's a great tactic.

2652
02:25:06,281 --> 02:25:09,850
It's a very great technique I think. I
don't know why they don't do it honestly.

2653
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:13,230
And then k one they didn't do it because
Japan isn't like big on the blood thing.

2654
02:25:13,710 --> 02:25:16,800
So maybe that was why know they
stop fights and wiped the blood off,

2655
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:18,370
all that stuff.
But uh,

2656
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:24,130
I really love elbows and like people
get guys like Nathan carnage more. Sure.

2657
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:26,740
Yeah. He was like the elbow
God was like, Oh yeah,

2658
02:25:26,741 --> 02:25:30,680
beautiful boxing ability and the
sneaking in the elbows, you know, I,

2659
02:25:30,730 --> 02:25:33,760
I'm a big fan of the elbow. Yeah.
And I think that those guys,

2660
02:25:33,761 --> 02:25:36,970
when they're fighting and
kickboxing as opposed to Moy Tai,

2661
02:25:36,971 --> 02:25:40,260
there's like an element of their
game that they've worked so hard to,

2662
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:44,710
to adapt and to, to get proficient at.
And then that element's been removed.

2663
02:25:44,711 --> 02:25:49,270
You're forcing them to fight it like 70%.
Exactly. Yeah. And this happened in with,

2664
02:25:49,271 --> 02:25:52,210
with Simon, you know, in that fight
with me. And that was his first fight.

2665
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:54,520
His first loss was his
first kick boxing fight.

2666
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:56,830
First knockout loss was
the first key proxy fight.

2667
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:01,210
And then this one that just happened was
also in kickboxing or San shall rules

2668
02:26:01,211 --> 02:26:04,680
or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, it was
tan shall rule secret. Wink.

2669
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:08,910
When lung fung or so San showered, you're
allowed to throw takedowns and stuff.

2670
02:26:09,230 --> 02:26:12,880
I don't know really know about that. I
mean they call, it seems like San show,

2671
02:26:12,881 --> 02:26:15,410
but they call it something
that weanling fung. Um,

2672
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:18,430
I did it once and it was horrible for me
is actually when I tore my knee apart.

2673
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:22,800
Um, but it was like you're allowed
to judo throw or like, uh, but,

2674
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:26,140
but somehow they were yelling at Simon
when he was trying to clinch and I don't

2675
02:26:26,141 --> 02:26:26,974
really understand it.

2676
02:26:27,010 --> 02:26:30,340
What do you think about what John Wayne
Pars doing that cage combat thing?

2677
02:26:30,341 --> 02:26:31,810
He's got like,
he's,

2678
02:26:31,811 --> 02:26:36,070
he's like got Moitai but they're
fighting in a cage with like MMA gloves.

2679
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:41,570
I particularly don't care for it. I mean,
I don't like, um, I think it's, it's,

2680
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:45,850
I just see it as a gimmick over trying
to tap into the MMA scene. I mean,

2681
02:26:45,851 --> 02:26:48,310
like we just talked about the cage.
It makes it really hard to see.

2682
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:52,270
I don't think that you can clinches
well against the cage as you can in the

2683
02:26:52,271 --> 02:26:54,040
ropes because you couldn't
move them backwards.

2684
02:26:56,530 --> 02:26:57,680
And I think it's more about like a,

2685
02:26:57,720 --> 02:27:02,190
just attaching the gimmick or making it
more brutal than, you know, thing that,

2686
02:27:03,070 --> 02:27:07,030
and I think a lot of guys or a breaking
their hands with the little gloves,

2687
02:27:07,031 --> 02:27:11,380
those little gloves doing it. I wouldn't,
I wouldn't want to do it defensively.

2688
02:27:11,381 --> 02:27:12,400
It's a big issue,
right,

2689
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:15,400
with the little gloves so we don't
slip punches through where you can't,

2690
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:16,930
you know,
I thought it was going to be,

2691
02:27:16,931 --> 02:27:18,910
and then when I started training
for the Melvin fight it,

2692
02:27:18,911 --> 02:27:21,070
I didn't find that much difference.
Um,

2693
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:25,780
although I think if I had,
if Bella had a boxing glove on,

2694
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:27,420
it hit me on top of the head there.

2695
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:30,700
It might another put my legs out and I
might not have dropped as as easily as I

2696
02:27:30,701 --> 02:27:31,660
did.
Um,

2697
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:36,640
I don't know if Melvin would have went
down from that right hook with a boxing

2698
02:27:36,641 --> 02:27:38,620
glove as,
as dramatically as he did.

2699
02:27:39,010 --> 02:27:43,300
Did Glory adopt k one rules just because
k one was like the big organization to

2700
02:27:43,301 --> 02:27:47,000
k one started to fall off and then it's,
showtime came along and it,

2701
02:27:47,001 --> 02:27:48,670
showtime put up some really big fights.

2702
02:27:48,671 --> 02:27:53,050
And then Gloria kind of came along and
took that over. I think that's, that's uh,

2703
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:57,910
exactly what happened. I think that, uh,
the, from what I understand that guys

2704
02:27:59,770 --> 02:28:03,940
k one was k one and then most of the
fighters from Holland were under one

2705
02:28:03,941 --> 02:28:08,020
management team. And uh,
when k one started to fail,

2706
02:28:08,021 --> 02:28:09,160
that management team

2707
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:15,490
had all the contracts for the k one guys
and they started it showtime because

2708
02:28:15,491 --> 02:28:19,310
they already had all the fighters in a
contract. And then when it's showtime, um,

2709
02:28:19,450 --> 02:28:21,860
eventually sold to a

2710
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:26,930
glory that the company glory
and then they, so they, it
was just like same people,

2711
02:28:26,931 --> 02:28:30,920
same scenario. It just grew from
that. And then now it's um, you know,

2712
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:36,140
so lion fight is the only really big moy
promotion like national on television,

2713
02:28:36,241 --> 02:28:37,530
national more type promotion.
Yes.

2714
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:40,810
Country. I think legacy fighting
just got, just made a deal. Um,

2715
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:43,280
it was on TV and on their
own and be access as well.

2716
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:47,540
Oh, their access to interesting. Yeah.
Yeah. Access is fucking great man.

2717
02:28:47,541 --> 02:28:49,130
Which used to be HD net.

2718
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:53,840
It's like one of the best accesses or
best ways to access like up and coming

2719
02:28:53,841 --> 02:28:56,360
fighters and like the
smaller organizations.

2720
02:28:56,740 --> 02:29:00,870
Right. Uh, I think uh, yeah,
I don't get that channel.

2721
02:29:00,871 --> 02:29:02,140
I remember with HD net was on there,

2722
02:29:02,230 --> 02:29:07,230
then they had the MMA MMA shows with her
on h was it WEC was on each thing then?

2723
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:12,190
No, it was um, up in
Canada. The fuck's his name.

2724
02:29:13,590 --> 02:29:17,460
Oh God damn it.
I can't remember in Edmonton.

2725
02:29:17,461 --> 02:29:21,540
You know what I'm talking about
the dude. But uh, now, um,

2726
02:29:21,570 --> 02:29:24,540
and you remember what your spike TV
when the UFC was still on it and had the

2727
02:29:24,541 --> 02:29:27,210
ultimate fighter that was like the
kind of the home for combat sports.

2728
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:32,240
And I know that a spike TV is now a ending
I think in March and they just signed

2729
02:29:33,331 --> 02:29:38,220
a spike. TV's rebranding like or re
self and like the change in the name.

2730
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:40,350
No, a rebranding. They're changing,

2731
02:29:40,351 --> 02:29:44,040
they're revitalizing their look
or something. I don't know.

2732
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:46,470
They're trying to get back to
being the home for combat sports.

2733
02:29:46,471 --> 02:29:51,471
I know they just signed a deal with
the Floyd Mayweather is a manager.

2734
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:55,200
They may have boxing, they're gonna
have boxing on, uh, on Spike TV now too.

2735
02:29:55,230 --> 02:29:57,420
Oh yeah. They're having
like golden glory, right.

2736
02:29:59,140 --> 02:30:00,860
I mean, not golden glory. A golden boy,

2737
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:05,360
golden boy productions is going to be
on a spike TV if it's and golden. Yeah.

2738
02:30:05,390 --> 02:30:08,870
Boy, it's a I'm Floyd Mayweather's coach.
I forget what they're going to call it.

2739
02:30:08,871 --> 02:30:10,760
What's Al Haymon um,
is promoting it.

2740
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:14,140
And then so now they're going to
have boxing kickboxing and you know,

2741
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:18,590
Bella Torben may on spike,
which is really, that's
beautiful. The good for a cause.

2742
02:30:18,591 --> 02:30:20,900
That's their Devindra, the
demographic, you know, it was,

2743
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:24,740
it was all kind of geared around the
ultimate fighter and all their shows were

2744
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:28,040
like the same. Um, I think
from my perspective, so

2745
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:30,770
I think it's great. I think that,
you know, the more, the better.

2746
02:30:30,771 --> 02:30:34,760
I just think they just changed. Name
belter yeah. Fucking like goofy name.

2747
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:38,150
What do you think better?
What does it mean fuck is a Bella tour?

2748
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:43,030
How to even spell it? Is
it one l I spell it wrong.

2749
02:30:43,031 --> 02:30:45,560
And every time. I love the
fights. I love the organization.

2750
02:30:45,561 --> 02:30:48,980
But the Chicago just spike TV, MMA,
it's fun. It's mixed martial arts.

2751
02:30:48,981 --> 02:30:52,730
Everybody knows what it is. It's just
why, you know, like when you watch boxing,

2752
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:56,900
it's not, you know, the funder Phis
boxing right now. Like why have,

2753
02:30:56,930 --> 02:31:01,850
the name is the UFC? Like when
it comes to MMA, UFC is like NFL,

2754
02:31:01,851 --> 02:31:05,580
right? It's got that. It's like cute tips
and Kleenex. You know, you don't want,

2755
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:09,650
you don't ask for a tissue. You, hey, give
me a kleenex. You know, give me a cue tip.

2756
02:31:09,650 --> 02:31:12,110
You don't ask me. I have a cotton
swab. You know what I mean?

2757
02:31:12,111 --> 02:31:16,030
It's like they become names. Like I'll
have a coke. Like, you know? Yeah.

2758
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:19,900
It becomes like, I think velcro was
actually a patent, isn't it? I don't know,

2759
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:21,540
but no,
exactly.

2760
02:31:22,250 --> 02:31:25,620
Why a father-in-law's in the army
and they don't call it velcro.

2761
02:31:25,621 --> 02:31:27,540
It's called something else.
Can loop,

2762
02:31:27,690 --> 02:31:31,380
hook and loop or something because
of old crow is a brand. Right.

2763
02:31:31,381 --> 02:31:35,220
So it was the same thing,
right? Yeah. But that said,

2764
02:31:35,370 --> 02:31:38,880
MMA is what it is. Everybody knows
it's mixed martial arts, you know.

2765
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:43,020
And I think that if they just went with
MMA, you know, just have MMA on Spike TV,

2766
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:46,710
have the name of the fighters be
the the what's important, you know,

2767
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:50,910
I think Bella tore this, the name itself
is kind of goofy in the fucking helmet.

2768
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:52,590
Like why is it a Roman guy with a helmet?

2769
02:31:53,790 --> 02:31:56,880
Was that or did that come
about around the 300 thing?

2770
02:31:56,881 --> 02:32:01,760
Cause it seems very thorough. We
have to ask. It is kind of kind of,

2771
02:32:01,890 --> 02:32:05,370
I think it's a Roman thing,
the the name, but whatever.

2772
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:09,180
Maximum fighting championship was what
I was trying to go. Remember. MFC,

2773
02:32:09,181 --> 02:32:11,370
mark paviches organization
would shop in Edmonton,

2774
02:32:11,371 --> 02:32:15,370
which is another good thing to watch where
like you see a lot of like Ryan, Jim,

2775
02:32:15,371 --> 02:32:18,690
Oh came out of there a lot of young up
and coming guys that are really good

2776
02:32:18,691 --> 02:32:22,650
fighters came out with these hg net fights
and they step put on back in the day.

2777
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:27,450
So if, if, if spike can do that and
just make it like the home for fighting,

2778
02:32:27,451 --> 02:32:32,250
like every Friday night boxing and MMA
kickboxing people will get programmed if

2779
02:32:32,251 --> 02:32:35,030
they just stick with Gloria. I
feel like a can't miss. Yeah.

2780
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:38,430
It's just a matter of
promoting it correctly.

2781
02:32:38,460 --> 02:32:40,140
Getting people to understand like these,

2782
02:32:40,141 --> 02:32:44,520
these are the best kick boxers on
earth and it's super high level shit.

2783
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:45,960
It's not like,
you know,

2784
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:48,630
they're just learning how to
kickbox we're putting them on TV.

2785
02:32:48,631 --> 02:32:50,130
Like these are the best of the best.

2786
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:54,720
Do you think in there needs to be more
Americans fighting for American audience

2787
02:32:54,721 --> 02:32:57,900
to a cause? I hear that a lot and
I don't know. I mean I read that.

2788
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:02,970
Are we that some people, I don't know if
we were that way or not. Some people are,

2789
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:04,850
yeah,
there's a lot of us go,

2790
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:08,690
I don't want to watch this Turkish
guy cause it's Turkish liar.

2791
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:11,790
Fucking American flag on a short,
send them out that don't want them talk.

2792
02:33:11,880 --> 02:33:16,350
They'll talk, they'll do
that. They'll fucking,

2793
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:19,680
you'll get caught. Well listen
man, I know you must have to pee.

2794
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:23,940
You've been holding onto that water? I
do. I know you do. And uh, this weekend,

2795
02:33:23,941 --> 02:33:26,520
this Friday night, um,
folks who couldn't watch it,

2796
02:33:26,521 --> 02:33:31,460
it's going to be live on spike TV. It's
glory 19. And where's it is from Virginia,

2797
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:35,460
Hampton, Virginia, Hampton,
Virginia Colosseum I think, um,

2798
02:33:35,490 --> 02:33:39,600
is is a huge event. If you've
never watched kickboxing before it,

2799
02:33:39,601 --> 02:33:44,601
let this be your first one and definitely
cheer from my man Joe Schilling who

2800
02:33:44,871 --> 02:33:49,380
will be fighting in the Co main
event of the evening. It's a, it's a,

2801
02:33:49,381 --> 02:33:54,040
it's going to be a big card for spike
and a big card for Gloria and Goddamn,

2802
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:58,350
I hope it's successful. So
let's try to pump it up. Set
your dvrs, watch that shit.

2803
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:02,250
Joe Schilling, much love my French. Thank
you very much. Really appreciate it.

2804
02:34:02,370 --> 02:34:06,570
I'm a huge fan fan boy geeking out
right here. So this is great. Um,

2805
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:11,580
you could follow Joe on Twitter. It's Joe
Schilling three is his Twitter handle?

2806
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:15,900
How come three, who the fuck is or do
you find Joe Schilling? One or two?

2807
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:19,600
Let me know cause I'm going to sit back.
I don't know how I got stuck with three.

2808
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:21,910
They should be able to take that over.

2809
02:34:21,940 --> 02:34:26,050
Is there a guy that's Joe Schilling
one who's Joe showing? What's luck?

2810
02:34:26,051 --> 02:34:29,710
I don't know. Oh, he's a basketball
player for Duke. You dork.

2811
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:33,490
How dare you? I still got two
followers come. What the fuck?

2812
02:34:33,491 --> 02:34:36,730
He's not even really a,
God dammit, Joe Shit.

2813
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:41,680
He's got two fucking followers too.
It's terrible. This is bullshit.

2814
02:34:41,710 --> 02:34:45,100
Bullshit. Take it over. Okay. All
right, my friend. Good luck to you.

2815
