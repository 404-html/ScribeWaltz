1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,091
Drive by day,

2
00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:03,760
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,300
It's that and then the next paper view
is Holly Holm versus Germane Jermaine

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,383
Durand Domain,

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,223
which is,

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,403
it's a tough sell,

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,403
right?

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,460
It's a very good site.

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,090
I would buy it as a hardcore Farron,

10
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,220
I'll buy it for sure.

11
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:18,850
For sure.

12
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,540
And we'll probably,

13
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,710
but the bottom line,

14
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,510
a hundred a hundred thousand people.

15
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:23,344
Well

16
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,180
yeah,

17
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,600
yeah.

18
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,640
It ain't gon be Connor Mcgregor numbers.

19
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,030
Right.

20
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,780
Bottom line.

21
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,200
Connor when she lost it and
I'm sure he likes Rhonda by,

22
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,400
but business wise he's like excellent.

23
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,690
Excellent.

24
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,230
Yeah,

25
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,000
it's,

26
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,211
well,

27
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:40,570
it's a tricky situation now
with the marketing campaign,

28
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,290
the dumb yet WME WME
put together for this.

29
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:49,291
That was so Rhonda heavy and then Rhonda
gets smashed and now what are you going

30
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,910
to do for what you're going to
like the girl who smashed Rhonda,

31
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:54,460
is that what Amanda gets
for her next title fight?

32
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,600
You do a press tour.

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
World press or with her like let's,

34
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,300
let's introduce you to the girl.

35
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,190
Beat the shit out of Rhonda
now she's not fighting.

36
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:03,010
Let's do this press tour that
she deserves all this stuff.

37
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,050
Piggy back on Ronda again.

38
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,680
Yes.

39
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,760
And show the beating.

40
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,331
Well,

41
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:07,601
you know,

42
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,930
she sort of retired two
legends in the sport.

43
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,160
That's why she's my fighter of the year.

44
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,410
She retired and then she retired.

45
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:15,940
Rhonda if Rhonda retires,

46
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,921
that's huge.

47
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,441
She retired.

48
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,220
Both of them.

49
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,430
All of a sudden Amanda is Nate Diaz.

50
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,990
Did you see cat Zingano
posted on Instagram that
Amanda blocked her cause cats

51
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:26,800
and Gano uh,

52
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,800
stopped Amanda and Amanda was a hurting
cats and gone old bad in the first

53
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:32,381
round.

54
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:32,941
Real bad.

55
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,570
A cat was in big fucking trouble,

56
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,340
but she survived and went on to stop.

57
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,930
Amanda and I love cat but I'll,

58
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:39,280
I'll,

59
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,030
I'll uh,

60
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,440
fucking Amanda could do is like,

61
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,030
you lost the chick I just
beat and 17 seconds with will,

62
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,220
but she got caught in an arm bar.

63
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:45,941
I mean,

64
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,140
how did Amanda lose the fight?

65
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:47,630
I don't remember.

66
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,371
She beat her down.

67
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:49,600
She beat her down in the third round.

68
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,480
Cat got on top and started
blasting her and she kind of gas.

69
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:52,930
No.

70
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,070
Well she kinda gas but it was,

71
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:55,390
pat is ferocious.

72
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,860
Castlemont's Amanda,

73
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,780
you don't that fucking scream.

74
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,200
This is a recording of Cat
Zingano screaming after
she won that fight and it's

75
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,660
so primal,

76
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:07,991
dude.

77
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,460
It's like an animal screen.

78
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,200
I think you played it before
on the podcast because it was,

79
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,041
it was like punch.

80
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:13,421
You did it.

81
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:13,750
I was like,

82
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,583
Whoa,

83
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,880
there's some shit you here.

84
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,023
That's it.

85
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,450
God Dog.

86
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,590
Come on man.

87
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,880
That shit that's in your bone.

88
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,620
But that's after all that darkness.

89
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,420
She dealt with it.

90
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,820
Her husband committed suicide and
just all this diabetes was that.

91
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,350
That was after that is.

92
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,170
That was the virus afterwards.

93
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,220
It was the play that again,

94
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:36,670
Jamie,

95
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,503
play that again.

96
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,793
Listen to me.

97
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,993
Shit.

98
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,590
That shit makes you can for Roche's,

99
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,770
but to answer your question from before,

100
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,760
not to interrupt you.

101
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,990
This sitting on a fucking gold,

102
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,220
William Morris.

103
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,050
Now with this fuck of the man that Nunez.

104
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,160
I told you last night,

105
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,320
she's probably the LBGT community.

106
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,320
Jack [inaudible] fucking pockets.

107
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,040
Okay.

108
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,610
Excuse me.

109
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,960
Pocket Ltg.

110
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,000
It's Lbgtq a.

111
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:13,890
Now listen,

112
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,063
God damn.

113
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,200
What does that got to keep up lesbians,

114
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,360
gays,

115
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,770
while the old picture of music,

116
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,030
I don't know how to
change a lottery ticket.

117
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,530
They just hit the fucking lottery thing.

118
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,260
ASEXUALS are in there today
and Liz Carmouche before that,

119
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,123
but it looks,

120
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,030
she was still fit outs,

121
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,010
but Liz Carmouche wasn't
the champion work.

122
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:33,801
Once you're the chair,

123
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:34,690
she's the champion.

124
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,471
Press everything.

125
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,210
And when Liz Carmouche fought Ronda,

126
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,450
she fought her at the first fight
when no one knew who Ronda was.

127
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,310
So Rhonda has all this hype behind her.

128
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:44,740
She wins that fight and then goes on.

129
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,221
And you know,

130
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,630
Liz has done well in the UFC,

131
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,380
but having that it does,

132
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,270
it's not the same.

133
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,420
My manager,

134
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,630
she has her victor,

135
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,441
she's awesome.

136
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,274
Have you ever seen her fight?

137
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:54,590
Tony?

138
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,620
Ebinger very tough.

139
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,490
I don't think she is bad ass.

140
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,300
He's an eviction.

141
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,170
Super tough.

142
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,004
She's really good.

143
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,800
And she's opened the gay too.

144
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,940
And what way does she,

145
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,290
she's hilarious man.

146
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,124
I love that chick.

147
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,610
Uh,

148
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,780
she's like one 35,

149
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,190
one 35 one 45.

150
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,490
She's good man.

151
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,830
This is going to be more,

152
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,170
it's,

153
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,040
it's the same thing we were talking about
like when Anderson was in his prime,

154
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,780
when he was just a light
and people on fire,

155
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,550
the division was like,

156
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,241
there wasn't,

157
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:19,460
you know,

158
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,901
you had to like a,

159
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:23,380
Patrick Otay had a couple of
fights for the title Talus latest.

160
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,040
We're like,

161
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,873
there's no one,

162
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,540
there's no,

163
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,860
well rich Franklin was the champ,

164
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,330
but there's no overwhelming
need to see that fight.

165
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,171
You know what I mean?

166
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,160
Like you want to see the fight,

167
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:33,881
cause I'm interested in,

168
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,410
see Patrick's got a great chin,

169
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,400
he's got power.

170
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,330
Let's see what happens.

171
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,620
But it's not like,

172
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:38,891
oh,

173
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,300
here's the next one.

174
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,190
It's like Cody Garbrandt
fight and Dominick Cruz,

175
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:42,520
we were like,

176
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:42,881
oh,

177
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,130
let's see what happens here.

178
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,430
There was no one like that for
Anderson for a long ass time.

179
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,070
And I think in the women's
Bantam Weight Division,

180
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,720
you've got to kind of similar situation.

181
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,770
Now it's like,

182
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,590
now you have Amanda Nunez
who beats the shit out of me.

183
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,150
Hsa me is going a step back.

184
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,170
She's gone now.

185
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,430
She beats the shit out of,

186
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:00,790
uh,

187
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,450
Rhonda.

188
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,560
Rhonda steps back.

189
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,300
Holly goes up to one 45
change remainder random man,

190
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,390
you got to change that shit.

191
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,970
Why?

192
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,970
Why not have a man to fight for both belts

193
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,610
to save that card?

194
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:13,600
Fuck yeah.

195
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,160
I mean it make some moves cause,

196
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,350
cause if you've seen the car window,

197
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,770
the cop or man Holly's are prominent card.

198
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,720
How is the headliner?

199
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,681
That's what I'm saying.

200
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,060
Holly's fighting Germane to
random me for the one 45 pounds.

201
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,090
I thought they should give Jermaine Demand
Jamais thousand dollars that she does

202
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,320
already beat her by the way they need it.

203
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,470
None of beat.

204
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,000
Who I thought Nunez Nunez
already beat Jorin Jemaine Duran.

205
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,250
Yeah,

206
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,240
she beat her in the UFC.

207
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:37,630
Yeah.

208
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,550
Jermaine is a wicked kid.

209
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:40,690
Kickboxer her.

210
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,400
She's a world world class.

211
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,810
Multiple time world champion.

212
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,250
Kickboxer I think she's,

213
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,380
I think she won the Moitai world.

214
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,300
[inaudible] title several occasions.

215
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,860
She's like really elite
as a more time for fun.

216
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,760
But they'd gloves stand up,

217
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,683
always stand up.

218
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,950
There's no ground.

219
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,550
As soon as she got in the UFC,

220
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:03,551
you could see like that transition
between learning the striking with a,

221
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:04,191
with,

222
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:07,100
with take downs versus just
fighting to kickbox about.

223
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,090
It's a big transition.

224
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:08,770
Takes time.

225
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,050
Yeah.

226
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,883
But you're also going,

227
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,390
people aren't going to give you the time.

228
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,931
Exactly.

229
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,970
They're just fucking shooting
in our beating her up and
taking her down and it's

230
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:15,620
just,

231
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,650
it's just a different sport.

232
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,500
I thought the card was pretty good.

233
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,221
It's in Brooklyn.

234
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:19,610
Yes.

235
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,690
Travis Browne is fight.

236
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,410
Derrick Lewis.

237
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,450
That's an interesting fight.

238
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,601
But what's,

239
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:23,931
you know,

240
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:24,201
I mean,

241
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:24,730
what is true,

242
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,300
where's Travis Travis's
head out right now?

243
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,530
He's trained the same camp,

244
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,040
isn't he?

245
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,460
Yes.

246
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,240
God dammit.

247
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,930
Travis.

248
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah.

249
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,210
Holly Holm versus Amanda Nunez.

250
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,170
That's the fight right there.

251
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:33,861
Yeah,

252
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,490
I agree with you.

253
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,130
I think at one 35 nights a
fucking should do that at this.

254
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,430
Uh,

255
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,090
for this card.

256
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,301
No.

257
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:38,631
Make it,

258
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,670
make a man of the two belt champion.

259
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:45,380
But then you have to remember
the Valentina Shevchenko
just beat Holly and has

260
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,660
come off 10 losses.

261
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,060
Yeah.

262
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,590
And Valentino beat her up.

263
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,424
Stand up.

264
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,543
Right Hook.

265
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,463
Fold

266
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,450
those two together.

267
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,283
Yeah.

268
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,820
They need help with this car.

269
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,960
The problem is most people,

270
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,160
even though Valentino one,

271
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,600
they don't know who she is yet,

272
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,830
even though she won,

273
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,770
I mean she needs a few more victories
inside the UFC in order to get people

274
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:04,480
excited.

275
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,650
Paper view this paper.

276
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,170
Yeah.

277
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,830
Brooklyn.

278
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,360
The only reason people know Holly too
is they don't know the her past losses

279
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:10,850
really?

280
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,590
They granted her flight was on Fox,

281
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,360
but all they knows she's the
girl that knocked out Rhonda.

282
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,194
That's what selling is.

283
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,390
Heady,

284
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,630
Bro.

285
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,960
You trying to say that this isn't
going to get you last 60 bucks.

286
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,570
I'm just saying that I
will illegally stream it.

287
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,650
Last one,

288
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,650
Amanda Nunez just fought for 45 seconds.

289
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,484
She's fresh.

290
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,110
Have her headline that car.

291
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,591
Hey Man,

292
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:28,560
let's build her up with,

293
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,053
where's the fire?

294
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,650
Where's the fire?

295
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,050
Is that the Superbowl card?

296
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,033
Yeah.

297
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,730
Damn.

298
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,590
I know.

299
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,311
I agree with that.

300
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:36,690
Yeah,

301
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,523
that's not,

302
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,210
that's February saying no,

303
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,401
no.

304
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,690
Super Bowl weekend is in Houston.

305
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,883
All different card.

306
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,341
Oh,

307
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:43,670
it is?

308
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,170
Yeah,

309
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,350
totally change in one.

310
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:47,330
I don't think they have
that card locked up either,

311
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:48,020
by the way.

312
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,110
I think there's still moving fights
around for that Brooklyn Card because I

313
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,680
think they recognize that that did
need a little bit more juice on that

314
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,020
card and Vegas this year.

315
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,381
No,

316
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,110
it's not finished.

317
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,150
It's in Houston this year.

318
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,220
And the soup bowls and Hughes.

319
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,461
She,

320
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:01,070
yeah.

321
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,080
Or is it new bronc Houston or Dallas?

322
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,060
I thought it was Dallas is a Houston,

323
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,403
Texas,

324
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,040
Texas.

325
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,180
So that's a,

326
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,650
they'll have a big card for,

327
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,100
uh,

328
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,390
for the UFC there.

329
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,951
They don't hate you,

330
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:12,320
man.

331
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,153
That's a great fight.

332
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,130
Now is a Bermudez and chance on John.

333
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:16,701
That's a good fight.

334
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,120
But what,

335
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,380
what a day is that?

336
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,040
Yes.

337
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,270
That would sell seven paper.

338
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,104
February 5th,

339
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,640
fourth Superbowl's on the fifth.

340
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,474
This is the fourth.

341
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,291
Yeah.

342
