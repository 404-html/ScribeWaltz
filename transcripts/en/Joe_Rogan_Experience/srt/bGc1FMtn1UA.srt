1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,480
We are live ladies and gentlemen,
but you knew that you,

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,560
you can hear us.
We need to come up with a better way to 

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:14,560
start these fucking things.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:14,560
You have to have like we have you all 
heard.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,330
Yeah.
I think that's like trademark shit up.

6
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,000
We'd have to pay buffer.
It's like subsidies.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,930
What if we did backwards live?
We are.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,700
Then we would have to owe Yoda money.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,210
We're fucked.
If we do fucked.

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:34,211
If we don't.
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 

11
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:36,641
brought to you by kerosene games.
A kerosene games is one of our newest 

12
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:38,330
sponsors and I'm.
One of the things that me and brian sort

13
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:43,331
of committed to when we started doing 
this podcast was to make sure that we 

14
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,240
didn't ever get advertised by anybody 
that we don't believe in.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,260
You know,
just don't,

16
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:50,261
don't just take someone's money if you 
think the product is dog shit or if you 

17
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,570
would never use it yourself.
And uh,

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,680
so this.
So when we add somebody like kerosene 

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:56,680
games,
it's,

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,341
it's kind of a big deal for us.
They just seem like a really cool 

21
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:00,341
company.
They are,

22
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:04,510
first of all,
they're trying to make really bad ass 

23
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,361
games for iphones and IPADS and then 
coming out with android devices most 

24
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:11,921
likely in January,
possibly February for so those nights 

25
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:11,921
like,
which can be really incredible.

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,580
Galaxy s three are those,
the Samsung galaxy note to the huge ones

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,920
now you could,
um,

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,320
play the games on them and they're 
really bad ass and they're designed 

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,340
specifically for these sort of 
touchscreen devices,

30
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:30,341
very intuitive controls,
which is like a lot better than a game 

31
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,610
that you would get that like made to a 
pc first,

32
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,220
but then sort of poured it over.
So these,

33
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:35,420
uh,
it's just,

34
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:37,220
uh,
a much better way to do it.

35
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,220
And Kerosene Games is concentrating on 
doing just that.

36
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,100
And they're,
they're super like high quality,

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,930
beautiful looking.
It's really fun.

38
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:50,050
The first game is called Blade slayer.
It's like some dude who's like a bionic 

39
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:52,240
cowboy character.
Hey,

40
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,280
returns from years at war and you just 
kicking ass.

41
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,570
Okay.
That's basically what it is.

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,560
Fucking with this ridiculous storylines.
Storylines all written.

43
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:00,860
But,

44
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,350
and don't forget if you have like,
like,

45
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:04,330
um,
like my sister just got an Ipad,

46
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,340
my Stepdad and my dad,
they all got ipads now.

47
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,410
I wouldn't do it with my dad or my 
Stepdad made my dad.

48
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,380
But like you can gift apps.
If you go to the APP store,

49
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:17,381
you can just send it.
Like if you have a cousin that just got 

50
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:19,541
an Ipad,
he wants a game right now that is 

51
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:19,541
fucking ninety nine cents and it's a 
good game.

52
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,450
And guess what?
Your cousin will freak out if it's first

53
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:21,680
ipad or a new ipad.

54
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,900
It's ninety nine cents until the 29th of
December.

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,390
And then I believe they're going to,
it's going to go back to,

56
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,760
it's only two 99 after that,
which is crazy.

57
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,140
But it is,
you're right,

58
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,240
it's ninety nine cents right now.
It's bad ass game.

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,340
It's really cool.
It's fun to play.

60
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:37,840
It looked bad ass,
you know?

61
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:41,590
And if you're really into video games 
for the IPADS,

62
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,120
it's a,
it's an interesting time because they're

63
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,310
starting to make like really cool high 
end games.

64
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,550
The video graphics,
the graphics processing power of those 

65
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,370
things isn't really amazing.
That's how you could watch these dvds on

66
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,140
it.
Full high resolution movies.

67
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,630
I mean there.
It's the technology that they have today

68
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:58,990
is awesome and it allows you to have a 
game like blade center.

69
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,140
So right now until

70
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,000
December 29th,
it's ninety nine cents.

71
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,820
Go check it out.
Fox.

72
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,870
Okay.
Alright.

73
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,230
Take a bath.
Go get.

74
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,850
Get your shit together.
All of you.

75
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,460
We were also brought to you by 
[inaudible] dot com.

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,740
That's o n n I t and a what on it is.
It is a sort of a.

77
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,160
We don't have a name for what kind of 
company that says because what we're 

78
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,000
trying to do is trying to sell you all 
things.

79
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,310
Bad Ass.
Anything that's good for you.

80
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:30,311
Anything that's healthy,
anything that promotes cognitive 

81
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,160
function or athletic performance or 
anything that can enhance your fitness.

82
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,430
Anything that's good for your body.
That's what we're trying to do.

83
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,460
We're just trying to get you the best 
health nutrition and supplements that 

84
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,780
are available.
We're trying to find you the best shit 

85
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:43,780
and sell it.
Anytime I find out about anything cool,

86
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,290
whether it's his Keith Weber Kettle Bell
DVD that we're selling now we just start

87
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:53,291
selling it like,
why wouldn't we fucking sell it if it's 

88
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,391
bad ass sell it.
That's how we feel about these BLENDTEC 

89
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,110
blenders and kettle bells and battle 
ropes and everything.

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,600
Breastfed

91
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,000
is all that comp.
What?

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Somebody told me too that you can put 
coffee beans and a BLENDTEC blender and 

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,290
I grind it up.
You know if you don't have a no,

94
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:12,291
if you don't have a coffee grinder and 
so I put a whole bag of coffee in there.

95
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,040
What did it do?
It caught on fire.

96
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,190
It's dangerous and it took me like an 
hour to get that shit out there.

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,020
It becomes.
It was psychology.

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,820
I started off as a smoke.
No,

99
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,070
it's like,
oh damn.

100
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,500
That shit's fucking crazy.
It's like,

101
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,730
must be able to the bean dust or 
something and then it.

102
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,780
Then it just starts.
It seriously got so hot that I felt it 

103
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:38,780
and I was like,
oh no,

104
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,460
that's.
There's a fire starting in there and I 

105
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,460
turned it off.

106
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,400
Yeah.
Like that's kind of an interesting 

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,050
thought.
Like you're not supposed to blend 

108
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,050
everything.

109
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,050
No,
I don't think like maybe I.

110
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,960
ipads aren't a great idea.
They blend iphone.

111
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,110
So you've seen those ads blend BLENDTEC 
ads.

112
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,140
I mean they turn an iphone into dust.
How can we can do that,

113
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,780
but it can't do coffee.
That's strange.

114
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,590
I don't know.
It smelled up the whole house.

115
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,200
Not In a good coffee.
My

116
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,220
friction thing.
Oh yeah.

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,480
The blades go so fast that the beans 
smoke.

118
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,270
Yeah.
Right.

119
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,250
If you want to start a fire near a cave 
man and he had a Blendtec blender,

120
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:11,910
that's what you would do.

121
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,300
It's awesome for celery though.
I'll tell you that if fox salary up 

122
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,020
salary and Kale and cucumbers because it
has water in it.

123
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:19,950
Shit up.
Yeah,

124
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,630
exactly.
It's weird.

125
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,480
There's this.
Really what it is is like a ridiculously

126
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:29,481
powered blender.
I mean it's ridiculous and it has like 

127
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:29,481
little cycles.
It goes on,

128
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:33,890
you know,
like when I make that bulletproof 

129
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,180
coffee,
my kids run out of the room because 

130
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,180
they're scared of the noise because 
it's,

131
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,800
it's scary.
It's.

132
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,090
You should probably have like a big 
shield in front of you.

133
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,760
Yeah.
For it.

134
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,900
Like,
like imagine having like your neighbors.

135
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:48,000
If you live in an apartment complex and 
you have a Blendtec blender,

136
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:50,700
you're doing Kale all day long.
It probably fucking hate you.

137
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,190
Yeah.
If you want those 6:00

138
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,180
AM fitness Douche bag.

139
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:53,270
Yeah.

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,630
Show everybody how bad ass you are by 
running at am.

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Guess what?
Dummy you can run at noon to get your 

142
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,900
sleep in.
It's not always good.

143
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,860
It's always good to get up at 6:00
AM anyway.

144
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,340
Don't blend coffee,
beans or coffee.

145
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Do blend coffee beans.
And don't say you listened to this 

146
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,750
podcast.
Your choice.

147
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,470
Either way I'm on it.
What else do we have that's new?

148
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,240
I think I've said everything.
Oh no,

149
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,010
that's a,
that's not this this week.

150
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,290
Um.
Oh,

151
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:33,291
the buffalo bars.
That's another thing that we've started 

152
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,331
carrying on.
We started carrying these natural 

153
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:35,331
buffalo jerky bars.
They're fucking bad ass.

154
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
I got right here.
Um,

155
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,120
but uh,
they're um,

156
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,600
they're made like this ancient Indian 
way with cranberries and shit.

157
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,310
Oh.
And we also have killer bee honey.

158
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,980
Why?
Because it sounds gangster as fuck.

159
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Okay.
Even if it's not even quite as good as 

160
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,541
regular honey,
you still ganged it from some fucking 

161
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:56,541
killer bees.
Okay.

162
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,270
On it.
Dot Com.

163
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,110
Use the code named Logan Rogan.
That's rjn.

164
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,170
Use that code name broken.
No,

165
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,180
just me.
Use the code name broken and save 

166
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,181
yourself 10 percent off any supplements,
any of that delicious hemp force and the

167
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:17,560
of that super nutritious Alpha brand.
All of it.

168
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,530
Usually name Rogan.
Alright.

169
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,590
Brian,
at the music for this gets ugly 

170
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:24,840
experience.

171
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,660
Are you okay bro?

172
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,760
There's a strange,
strange feeling in the room.

173
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't know what the fuck is going on,

174
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,680
but I do know that.
Matt,

175
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,350
how do I pronounce it?
Ven Ven grin.

176
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,990
Yes.
Yes.

177
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,410
That's it.
It's a tricky one.

178
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,450
And it,
it's props to you for not changing it.

179
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,280
Well,
I thank you.

180
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,080
A lot of people would have bailed.
Has Been pronounced wrong many times.

181
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,740
Yeah.
Well,

182
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,500
it's funny,
but like parents from other,

183
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,060
uh,
like,

184
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,010
like really,
uh,

185
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,800
countries with very unusual last names 
like Swartz,

186
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,580
Negra,
the amount of pressure,

187
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:13,581
they must have changed our name to 
something that the American people can 

188
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,720
pronounce a sloppy ass bitches I would 
say.

189
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:19,350
So I the worst is virgin.
I've heard virgin many times.

190
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,110
Salto when,
when you were a virgin,

191
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:24,510
was that painful?
It felt bad.

192
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,480
Matt is a professional poker player and 
you're a friend of our friend.

193
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:34,590
Aubrey's and a Alpha brain enthusiastic.
And I guess you,

194
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:39,591
uh,
apparently he said that you help like 

195
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:39,690
fighters sometimes with their mental 
game planning.

196
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,280
Yes.
I have two fighters right now,

197
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,530
Martin Kelman and calmly that I've 
worked with.

198
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,070
So I basically just focused on getting 
them present mentally before their 

199
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,070
fights because poker.
Sorry,

200
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,430
go ahead.
No,

201
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,450
please go.
Because poker is basically like 95 

202
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,290
percent mental.
So I've found ways to prepare myself

203
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,290
and you know,
I think it helps with mma because it's 

204
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:01,480
pure competition and if you're not there
mentally,

205
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:02,950
you know,
it doesn't matter how good you are,

206
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:04,900
you can get caught really easy if you're
not paying attention.

207
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,850
Yeah.
That's a subtle aspect to a,

208
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,880
to fighting that.
I think a lot of people aren't aware of 

209
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,640
the fact that a guy can look exactly the
same and be moving up,

210
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:20,681
but he could have lapses.
There's mental lapses that happened in 

211
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:23,651
some guys.
Those mental lapses sort of defined 

212
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:23,660
their careers because they have a lot of
talent,

213
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:24,770
but they,
for whatever reason,

214
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:25,970
they can never put it together.

215
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:26,900
Absolutely.
Yeah.

216
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,090
I mean if you get caught with one 
submission,

217
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:31,220
just one second off you could,
you could be out,

218
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,250
you know,
you could be tapping and it's the same 

219
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,171
thing with poker that's wives saw the 
both were kind of correlated and I 

220
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:38,171
wanted to do something new and 
different.

221
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,820
That hasn't really been done.
How did you get brought in on this?

222
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,570
On which the coaching.
You know,

223
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:47,600
one day I was,
I actually was watching Martin fight and

224
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:48,780
I saw,
um,

225
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,890
a lapse in his eyes where he was kind of
looking one way and then he was kind of 

226
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,610
lackadaisical for a minute and it got 
put away and I was like,

227
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,760
which was after Paul,
Tiago,

228
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:00,610
I think it was,
um,

229
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,800
yeah,
the one after policy I'll go.

230
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:04,850
He had a loss.
It was one,

231
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,760
it was his first loss out of his three 
that he had.

232
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,010
He had three.
And then you had two wins.

233
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,170
Do you know which one that was?
I don't really remember.

234
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,180
I'll look it up.
Yeah,

235
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,320
well anyway,
yeah,

236
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,690
I saw him kind of like get out of,
out of the moment.

237
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:22,691
I saw like I can see it in people's eyes
usually because playing poker you can 

238
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:22,691
kind of see that.
And uh,

239
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,790
so I contacted him on facebook and we 
just,

240
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,750
we met about three months later and I 
said,

241
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,500
hey,
I want to do this.

242
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,550
I've never done it,
you know,

243
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,680
would you like to be the first?
And he said,

244
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:31,340
sure.
So

245
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,680
That's interesting.
Now when you brought up that you saw 

246
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:36,680
that to him,
did he resist it?

247
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,350
Did he,
did he agree with you?

248
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,260
Like what?
You know?

249
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,680
Because a lot of times this is a 
strange,

250
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,830
it's a hard issue for fighters.
They're very emotionally attached to 

251
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,100
their work and so if you'll say like,
hey man,

252
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:48,060
you know,
you got this,

253
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,610
you got to be careful with the way you 
keep your chin,

254
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,640
like you're going to get hit.
Like you have to do something about 

255
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,951
that.
And if you say that like they'll get 

256
00:10:57,951 --> 00:11:00,830
angry at you and it's almost like they 
want to keep their chin up to show that 

257
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:00,830
you are wrong.
That's just their ego.

258
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,210
It is a weird thing though with,
with fighters.

259
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,710
It is.
So when you,

260
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,920
a guy who is a professional poker 
player,

261
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,780
a,
a non fighter goes,

262
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,600
you know,
as far as to say that you saw the actual

263
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:17,430
moment where a guy like Martin Kampmann 
who's a fucking professional killer,

264
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,920
you know what I'm saying?
I mean mark kamins bad motherfuckers.

265
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,310
So for you to like bring that up and for
him to accept it,

266
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,590
first of all,
it shows that he's a smart dude.

267
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,640
Absolutely.
He's,

268
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,440
he's a very,
you know,

269
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,440
aware guy and that's why he's so good.
He's been very open

270
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,390
when he's able to step outside of 
himself and learn things that you know,

271
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,190
that most people wouldn't consider 
learning.

272
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,020
And I think that's really important for 
growth,

273
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,410
you know,
as a fighter or you know,

274
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,660
mentally,
whatever you want to call it.

275
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,890
Well he got caught by Johnny Hendricks 
in his last fight.

276
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:48,250
But you know what man at first of all,
that guy can catch anybody like that.

277
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,480
We didn't work together.
His last fight,

278
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,700
we worked for his three win streak.
We work

279
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,770
the other.
We actually kind of had a disagreement 

280
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:56,770
on pricing.
So we didn't work together.

281
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:56,770
The last one,

282
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,930
dude,
that's a terrible thing to happen.

283
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,970
Yeah.
Wow.

284
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,740
You guys had a disagreement over money.

285
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,560
Yeah.
I shouldn't say that.

286
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,900
We shouldn't talk about what,
what it actually was.

287
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:08,510
It was just the disagreement.
Not a fair to Mr Kamin sure.

288
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,810
That sucks.
Any sexual tension?

289
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,020
No Martins is stuck.
What can I say in,

290
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,940
gives into the feeling?
I just let it go.

291
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,610
Got Cameron.
I'm a big fan of that dude.

292
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,650
I love that fight with,
um,

293
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,060
with um,
uh,

294
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,220
thiago Silva where he was losing the 
fight and Tiago sheets for that takedown

295
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,010
and gets that nasty get locks it in.
That's one thing about camping.

296
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,420
He's a kid yet.
Why?

297
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,350
Yeah.
He's very,

298
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,120
very tough,
very tough.

299
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,020
And people to sleep on his technique.
His Jujitsu is nasty,

300
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,840
is you just,
it was just as good as his,

301
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,680
uh,
his striking is underrated.

302
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,760
Yeah.
And he was wrestling.

303
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
Takedown defense is excellent.

304
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,110
But like,
like,

305
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:55,920
um,
uh,

306
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,280
when he fought.
I'm the dude out of the military camp.

307
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,920
I'm blanking on his name real quick.
I'll find it in a second.

308
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,850
But,
um,

309
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,910
uh,
that dude has some serious,

310
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:10,860
serious knockout power and uh,
he took them down and submitted them.

311
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:12,920
This is Jeremy Foundries and this is 
back in.

312
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:17,790
He's funny at one of your factories can 
bang a big guy's scary power.

313
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,560
He's got serious,
serious power.

314
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,000
He never,
for whatever reason,

315
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,670
never completely put it together,
had some good wins,

316
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,530
but never completely couldn't put it 
together.

317
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,770
But a cameraman caught him in the arm 
triangle and put them asleep and that 

318
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,680
was in camp.
Was fighting at one 85,

319
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,150
you know,
he's not even a big one.

320
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,260
70.
No he's not.

321
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,490
He doesn't cut much.
No,

322
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,580
I mean you can tell.
I mean those guys like the really big 

323
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,850
guys that get down to one 70 and you're 
standing next to him.

324
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,570
Like,
what the Fuck Demian Maia do Damien Maia

325
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:48,180
has gigantic.
That guy's really big.

326
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Yes.
It doesn't even look like it's the same 

327
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,240
weight class sometimes.
I'm just like,

328
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Whoa,
what's going on here?

329
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,200
Yeah,
like thiago alves talk about.

330
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,600
Oh my God,
he is the brick shit house.

331
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,750
You know?
And the dude gets all the way down to 

332
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:02,750
one 70 and you're like,
wow,

333
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,940
I don't know a couple of those att guys.
There's a guy named glazing,

334
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,700
glazing,
bow.

335
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,760
He's another one.
This guy,

336
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,350
I am not kidding you ladies and 
gentleman,

337
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:14,160
he looks like he weighs 200 pounds and 
he's fighting at 1:55.

338
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,150
He's so fucking big,
he,

339
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,820
I mean he might get as high as like one 
80 come fight time,

340
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,940
you know,
and then when you're 80 and you're 

341
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:25,940
swollen up with blood,
like when you,

342
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,560
you know,
you're pumped because you're in like a 

343
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:29,560
brutal fight and you look at them 
sometimes you go,

344
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,750
Oh fuck,
is that guy won 55?

345
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,290
How is that even possible?
It's mind boggling to me at least.

346
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,550
Yeah.
That's a weird aspect of the sport of 

347
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:39,550
MMA.
Um,

348
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,530
did you uh,
mentally coach them on that as well?

349
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:41,400
Like the weight cutting?

350
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,300
No,
no,

351
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:42,780
I,
you know,

352
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,640
hardly cuts.
No.

353
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,030
See you were talking earlier about,
you know,

354
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,860
it's hard to tell a fighter,
you know,

355
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,520
that as a killer what to do.
But I try to separate the two completely

356
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,960
because I'm a big MMA fan.
I've watched like every UFC for probably

357
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,220
four years and uh,
I can't,

358
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:58,430
I like as much as I want to chime in 
about technique or whatever.

359
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,510
I know that,
you know,

360
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,160
that's just not my right.
That's expert.

361
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,260
Right,
exactly.

362
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:05,240
So I try to keep it separate.

363
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,550
You're just concentrating on them having
a winning mindset.

364
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:13,551
Is that what it is?
I want them to get to beating the 

365
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:13,551
winning everything

366
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:13,551
on their mind.
I want to get off their mind.

367
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:16,610
I want them to just deal with anything 
that they might be thinking about,

368
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:19,070
whether it be a,
what's my next I want.

369
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,100
I want them to stay present.
I don't want them to think too much 

370
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,201
about the past or the future.
I want them to just be right there for 

371
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:26,201
that.
And that's the only thing that matters.

372
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:26,810
That's my goal.

373
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
And how do you,
how do you address their,

374
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,000
what they normally think about?
Like when,

375
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,660
when sometimes like big one.
I,

376
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,210
I've always seen with fighters one of 
the worst,

377
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:42,090
his girlfriend problems when fighters 
have girlfriend problems.

378
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,670
Man,
when shit goes bad like that can,

379
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,270
that can signify like a huge skid in 
their career.

380
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,020
Sure.
Well,

381
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,240
you know,
um,

382
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,320
both of the fighters are happily 
married,

383
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,380
so that's not an issue for me,
but how I would probably tackle it,

384
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,410
you know,
it's hard to get that stuff off your 

385
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:00,410
head,
you know,

386
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:00,410
you can feel like that's taking over,
you know,

387
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,671
when you break up with someone,
it just feels like you can't get away 

388
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:04,671
from that,
you know,

389
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:08,240
and uh,
most of the time it's just because 

390
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,681
you've never faced that,
you've never really faced it down and 

391
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:09,681
you kind of just push it aside and put 
it in the back of your mind.

392
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,180
But the way that,
the way to really do it,

393
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,330
it's just address it,
you know,

394
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,490
go back to exactly what happened and 
just deal with it,

395
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,390
you know,
as a man

396
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,050
and new pussy.
Yeah.

397
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,750
And it's also very important.
You cannot try to like,

398
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,810
you know what,
I'm just going to get my own shit 

399
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:24,810
together.
Stop,

400
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:24,970
go get laid.
What are you crazy?

401
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,980
Okay.
I'm not saying go fall in love,

402
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,680
but go get your freak on best medicine 
ever.

403
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Yeah.
With someone who would also like to get 

404
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:34,740
the freak out with you.
Okay.

405
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,130
Mutually beneficial,
that needs to be recognized that it is 

406
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,130
mutually beneficial and that's the only 
reason why it's any good.

407
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,050
We don't understand their point of view 
and they don't understand are part of 

408
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,730
you.
That's true in medicine.

409
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,760
Puts it.
You can die from if you take it with the

410
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,260
wrong things.
Yes.

411
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:51,100
You definitely die and or just ruin your
life and wish you were dead.

412
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:53,050
Yeah.
That's sometimes worse.

413
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,990
Sometimes worse.
Sometimes pussies worse than suicide.

414
00:16:55,991 --> 00:17:00,991
How about that?
It's like the Red Dye and the Jelly 

415
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:00,991
Bean.

416
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,010
Yeah.
We all know that one new to just can't 

417
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,010
keep it together.
When it comes to girls,

418
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,560
you know the guy's a little chicks 
dominate their life and yell at them and

419
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:10,561
tell them what to do and it's a.
it's a spooky thing when you see that 

420
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:11,350
kind of shit happened.
Well it becomes really real for them.

421
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:16,351
Right?
I mean like I try to think of it as 

422
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,731
like,
it's not that serious really in the 

423
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:17,731
scheme of things.
It's not really that serious.

424
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:21,511
It is to them in that moment.
In that moment it is separation anxiety 

425
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:21,520
and it's just as bad.
Of course,

426
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,870
uh,
for uh,

427
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:27,930
you know,
women that are involved with crazy 

428
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,491
fucked up men too that are trying to 
dominate your life probably even more 

429
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:33,360
worse because it's scary physically.
Like the threat of physical violence is 

430
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,460
much more prevalent.

431
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,650
It's especially if they try to tell you 
what to do with your life and their life

432
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:41,651
is kind of in shambles.
Like a lot of people want to give 

433
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:41,651
advice,
you know,

434
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:44,321
when they,
when they don't have their shit 

435
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:44,321
together.

436
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:44,321
Yeah,
it's hilarious.

437
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,150
But this is related on twitter today.
Some dude sent me some,

438
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,800
a thing on twitter,
like some comment about how I,

439
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,310
you know,
I need to uh,

440
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,750
behave.
And so I was like,

441
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,810
you know,
that I need to like take a dose of my 

442
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:00,810
own medicine or something like that.
One of them,

443
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,540
you know,
one of those sort of things.

444
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,060
So I'd go and look at his twitter 
profile real quick.

445
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:09,061
And his last tweet was about how he was 
depressed coming off of a coke binge.

446
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,280
And,
and I'm like,

447
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,400
do you think that like you should be 
giving advice to someone about how they 

448
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:23,561
should think like we're 30 seconds ago 
you were talking about coming off some 

449
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:26,930
off your first year.
Maybe you can say something that doesn't

450
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,120
seem like the type of person should be 
given that advice.

451
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,780
I found out that liquid coke was,
you know how the liquid coke they're 

452
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,961
using that they're also using it because
girls can put it in them and squirting 

453
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:40,370
their pussies before sex and they're 
buttholes and it numbs it down.

454
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,110
So you can just go to town on it.
If you put it in your Dick Hole,

455
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,780
it feels like you have the biggest dick 
hole in the whole entire world.

456
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:50,540
Like the bones just gonna slide out like
a hot dog.

457
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,280
Man.
That sounds terrible.

458
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,580
Oh,
you just gave people an idea.

459
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,140
Could you imagine?
Could you imagine getting so fucked up 

460
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,160
with regular sex?
Do you want to shoot coke in your Dick?

461
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,890
Like yeah,
sex.

462
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,430
Just not doing it for me anymore man.
But I found that like tubes up my ass.

463
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,560
The hardest part is getting that first 
part,

464
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:16,280
like stretching your whole life to fit 
the whole nose thing of the nose spray,

465
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,020
which is that what you would use on your
nose,

466
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,700
nasal spray,
a nasal spray,

467
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,730
and I guess a saline solution so it's 
used for your eyes,

468
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:24,590
so your Dick cries all the time so it's 
fine,

469
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,510
but then eventually their pussy and 
asshole is going to start being numb and

470
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,010
then we're going to be in a horrible 
pain.

471
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,690
They probably going to have infections 
and shit.

472
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,740
That's all I'd be thinking about why 
we're doing it,

473
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,780
but like she can't even feel this.
What Joey Dee dee is it just cleans it 

474
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:39,780
right out.
Joe.

475
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,860
First of all,
Joey Diaz is not even a human.

476
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,550
So what are you saying?
The laws that apply to normal humans.

477
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,070
Just think about what Joe has done and 
here he is,

478
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:49,880
fine.
Healthy,

479
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:54,881
still alive and made a baby recently.
Now stop and think about the average 

480
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,300
human being.
If they go through Joey Diaz,

481
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,730
his life.
Have you had to go through Joey Diaz his

482
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,740
life and take all the drugs that he 
took?

483
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,750
Find yourself in all the situations you 
find.

484
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,530
Good luck reaching 50.
Good luck reaching where Joey is,

485
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,230
but you can't,
so he's not even human.

486
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,660
No.
You gave Joey Diaz is live to 100 

487
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:15,660
people.
Ninety nine

488
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,340
be dead.
That's a fact.

489
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,190
We've.
JDS was a robot.

490
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:24,191
When it goes home,
his whole body opens up into smaller 

491
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,191
little Jewish guy comes down and says,
hey,

492
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,881
how's it going?
I got to pay me working all the 

493
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:31,070
mechanicals.
That's why its stomach so hard because 

494
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,580
his stomach is like a knee.
He touched joey stomach.

495
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:34,700
It's not like A.
There's some dudes like give India.

496
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,050
You know you're hugging when they're 
really big.

497
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,420
They just given to you,
joey,

498
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,320
as you run into him.
It's like thump.

499
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,320
It feels like you're sitting on a really
hard rock.

500
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,690
I'm saying if he's on one side of the 
plan,

501
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:46,520
you should sit on the other balance of 
bitch out.

502
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,200
That's what I'm.
That's

503
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,970
what I'm saying.
Okay.

504
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,870
Joe.
He does a solid dude.

505
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,550
He's.
He's not just a.

506
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,640
he's not fat.
He's a solid guy and his head is 

507
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,060
gigantic.
Which a problem.

508
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,170
You try to lose some weight.
That's a weird thing with dudes like my 

509
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,830
friend Justin giant dude and I looked at
the size of his head.

510
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,360
I'm like,
that is also a giant head.

511
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,190
Like if that was on a normal person's 
body,

512
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,850
like,
like when you get really big,

513
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,080
if you get like,
you know,

514
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:23,081
certain dudes they get like incredibly 
obese will everything grows and then 

515
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:27,100
when they bring their body in,
when they lose the weight,

516
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,900
it looks very strange.
It's like what's going on?

517
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:31,310
Like why is his head's so big?
Like,

518
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:32,690
what's,
is it good?

519
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,500
I'm used to this giant Bonnie and it's 
just unusual for me or why?

520
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,880
What is,
what's going on here?

521
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,880
That's a sad thing though.
When you see someone who's,

522
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,710
uh,
lost their marbles so bad,

523
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:45,140
the eat themselves into oblivion.
You know,

524
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:50,530
when you read about like people that get
stuck in trailers and they got to cut a 

525
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,310
hole through the wall,
pull their couch out in,

526
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,380
bedded into the couch.
It's fucked to know that people can go 

527
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,380
that far off the rails.

528
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,210
Do you ever watch Dr Oz?
I've watched it before.

529
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,180
What do you think about him?
He's not that bad.

530
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:03,030
Right.
He's pretty interesting.

531
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,230
He seems like he's pretty legit.

532
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,090
Nice guy.
It doesn't seem like he's a bad guy,

533
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,690
you know,
I,

534
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,490
as long as they're not like super 
judgmental and like tough guy.

535
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:16,760
He liked doctor Phil is on occasion 
that,

536
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,680
you know,
I don't,

537
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,140
I don't like that attitude.
Like if you,

538
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:24,580
if you really want to help people's,
you need to get your act together.

539
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,560
That's not how you help people.
Stupid.

540
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,480
No,
that's nonsense.

541
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,290
You're dealing be rating them on 
television but he doesn't seem like that

542
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,520
kind of a doctor.
So yeah,

543
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,860
he's a medical doctor to actual real 
doctor.

544
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:36,070
Right.

545
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,070
I was,
I was just watching Dr Oz.

546
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,210
I've never seen it before.
It got really baked and it was,

547
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,670
he has this thing like,
you know,

548
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,670
everyone,
three out of four people are super tired

549
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,390
and there it's because they don't have 
enough of this one medicine or,

550
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,490
or,
or nutrient or whatever the fuck it is.

551
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,200
And uh,
they,

552
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,350
they brought these three women,
this woman was,

553
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,380
he's like,
I can fix all your shit using this one 

554
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,360
thing that you have to take every day.
Multiple Times a day and they're like,

555
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,010
well,
it's because I have four kids,

556
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:08,011
I have to wake up every morning at six 
and do this and this and this is like 

557
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:08,011
vitamin,
it's magnesium and,

558
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,240
and,
and uh,

559
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:14,241
on,
it should get on top of magnesium 

560
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,871
because he said the thing is,
is that they don't have it in daily 

561
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:18,181
multivitamins because it be so big of a 
pill because you have to take it all day

562
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,500
long so you have to get out of food and 
there's like certain food,

563
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,180
like bananas,
spinach,

564
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,540
a Chenwa and all that stuff that has a 
high amount of it and it.

565
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:31,541
But if you don't have any of that,
you're just running on empty and your 

566
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:31,541
body has to like freak out and that's,
we get irritable.

567
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,240
That's when you're just like tired and 
fatigue all the time.

568
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,680
And I don't know if there's a way to 
have magnesium every day easy,

569
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,930
but it seems like that's,
that's a big thing.

570
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,750
Yeah.
I took it at night.

571
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:43,780
I take Zma.
That's the stuff that,

572
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:48,781
that Victor,
Conte gut also says is a natural 

573
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:49,730
testosterone booster or one of the most 
effective ones.

574
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:50,240
I'd take that over.

575
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
I take it every night too.
And I,

576
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,520
he sent me a case.

577
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,020
No,
actually I didn't take it last night,

578
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:59,021
so I'm lying.
I can't say every night and it's great 

579
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,001
if you're flag.
Sometimes I forget and it's great if 

580
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,840
you're sick and some of them have a 
Tryptophan or what not.

581
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,590
Trip defendant some something else.
Treat.

582
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,550
Defend is a,

583
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,300
that it's possible that they could have 
that in there.

584
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:08,980
You know,
everybody makes their own little,

585
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,680
a nutritional supplement sorta 
concoctions.

586
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,010
But um,
yeah,

587
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,280
zinc is also a,
that's a,

588
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,160
it's like it's a healthy mineral,
you know,

589
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,550
it's like your body should have it 
anyway and we should.

590
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,320
There's a lot of shit that we should 
take man,

591
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:28,321
that we don't take.
Most people just like barely get the 

592
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:30,960
amount of required daily vitamins in 
their diet and most people are not 

593
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,411
taking vitamin supplements and then most
people are not eating that much 

594
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:34,411
vegetables either.
I'm like,

595
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:38,101
man,
you are rolling the fucking dice with 

596
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,101
your body.
You know,

597
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,030
you got to give your body nutrients if 
you don't give your body nutrients.

598
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:42,760
It just fucking misfires.
And w the why.

599
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:47,761
Intelligent people neglect.
That to me drives me nuts because you 

600
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:49,420
can do both.
You've seen me eat,

601
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,980
I eat shit.
I'll eat shit.

602
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,020
I'll eat cheeseburgers,
I'll go off.

603
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,320
But I also supplement the fuck out of 
everything.

604
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,440
I make sure I'm always taken vitamins 
and for the most part when I'm not 

605
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,820
eating a fucking pastrami sandwich,
I will eat really healthy.

606
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,350
So I'll allow myself these like French 
fry binges and shit.

607
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,300
But for the most part I'm eating really 
healthy.

608
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,280
But if you really stone watching Dr Oz,
you're like okay,

609
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,910
this woman says she eats healthiest.
Heck she has the greatest diet ever.

610
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,070
She's just tired all the time.
And the other girl was like,

611
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,090
no,
I have 15 kids.

612
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:20,990
I'm,
I eat normal.

613
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:22,400
Like I,
I probably have enough.

614
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,700
Magnesium is probably not magnesium and 
not like a 25 year old crack addict,

615
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:26,540
you know?
And,

616
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,010
and,
and he just like blew it off.

617
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,820
Like all.
Alright,

618
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,410
see magnesium.
What's the secret?

619
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,000
And then he moves onto this next girl,
she's like,

620
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,920
I can't poop.
I tried everything.

621
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:36,140
I tried yogurts,
I try fruit and stuff like that.

622
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:36,800
And he goes,
well,

623
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,350
you need to try live culture,
yogurt and raspberries.

624
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:40,580
And she's just,
like I just said,

625
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,440
I've tried yogurt and fruits and stuff 
like that.

626
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,970
And it was just like,
move on.

627
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,550
I'm Dr Oz to Dr Oz.
And it's just a bunch of little fails.

628
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,590
He has good advice,
but the shows is a bunch of little fails

629
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,320
over and over again.
I highly recommend watching Dr.

630
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,280
I was super stoked.

631
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,150
Oh Wow.
Nice.

632
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,050
I wonder if there's a collection of Dr 
Oz's fails and if that sounds okay.

633
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,720
Not like half the time it's the people 
even say anything.

634
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,170
You could just tell by their faces.
They're like,

635
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,080
I just told you fruit in.

636
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,240
I think I got something wrong.
There can be something really wrong with

637
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:16,460
you when there's some people they have 
to do poop transplants.

638
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:21,461
So have you heard of this,
where you take my picture and put it in 

639
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:21,461
your butt wherever?
Yes.

640
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:22,480
Yes.
I'm not joking.

641
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I wonder if it.
Whether they do it between family 

642
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:27,640
members.
That's a really interesting question.

643
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,690
Um,
but,

644
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,610
but it's true.
It really is true.

645
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,120
They need fecal transplants.
What do they think of next?

646
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,450
I think fucking saves people's lives,
man.

647
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,700
Really?
Man.

648
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
Science as a mother Fucker,
isn't it?

649
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,460
It's just they're always coming up with 
some incredible shit that just makes you

650
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,350
go.
How did this even happen?

651
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:46,870
Well,
I,

652
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,870
I always find interesting to look back 
and be like,

653
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:49,410
Oh,
well,

654
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:52,140
20 years ago or whatever,
a long time ago,

655
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:53,640
lobotomies were considered,
you know,

656
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,930
normal,
right?

657
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,710
Like how it changes how science changes.

658
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,000
Like,
Oh,

659
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:57,540
our bad.
Yeah,

660
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,270
that's not good.
We can't really do that anymore.

661
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,420
I would like to think that we're way 
past that.

662
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,500
I would like to.
We're way past the law bottomy stage.

663
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,010
I would like to think that they pretty 
much know exactly what everything does 

664
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,360
as far as like what the negative health 
benefit or repercussions are.

665
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,100
But then you see pharmaceutical drugs 
and you find out that's not really the 

666
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,591
case.
I see like every week some new thing 

667
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,361
gets fucking yanked off the shelves from
recall signs of maybe they did do a lot 

668
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:32,901
of good though too.
I mean there's a lot of people that are 

669
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,181
alive because of pharmaceutical drugs 
because a lot of people that they have 

670
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:36,990
illnesses and they literally keeps them 
alive.

671
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,120
I uh,
I had back surgery a couple years ago 

672
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,120
and the pain pills they have are 
amazing.

673
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,990
Like I had shit no after,
uh,

674
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,110
after I healed up I got off on.

675
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,380
But like before that.
Oh yeah,

676
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:50,910
yeah,
yeah.

677
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,780
Actually I know,
I tried to get off them.

678
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,650
Here's what happened.
I,

679
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:59,670
I,
I tried to quit cold Turkey and I got 

680
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,060
physically ill,
like my whole body just felt like I 

681
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,060
wanted to die and I was like,
oh.

682
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,060
I was like,
all right,

683
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,030
I better weaned myself off and stuff.
So I just did like two and then one.

684
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,800
And what specifically were you taking 
hydrocodone?

685
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I think it was hydrocodone.
Is that the same as Oxycontin or 

686
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,360
oxycodone is what it's called and maybe 
it sounds kind of someone.

687
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,440
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

688
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,730
Yeah,
those,

689
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:19,620
uh,
it's an opiate based hoping it will be a

690
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,510
base,
but that will mess your body.

691
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,930
Like I can understand why people get 
addicted because like I said,

692
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:28,020
I tried to get off and it just,
my whole body was like wanting to die.

693
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,360
I felt like.
So it just,

694
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:29,850
uh,
you,

695
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:34,851
you get it,
it gets attached to your stuff 

696
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:34,851
basically.
Yeah.

697
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:34,851
Kinda like a,
uh,

698
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:35,190
you know,
that Spiderman,

699
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,200
Velma was that the black van them,
right?

700
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,280
Yeah,
sort of like that.

701
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:43,281
Like it just Kinda Tanya isn't crazy 
that they just trust that people are 

702
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,210
going to have the willpower to get 
through those.

703
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,650
I mean,
it is crazy.

704
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,040
It's crazy.
It's nuts that they're allowing people 

705
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,741
to become junkies.
Like literally anything like that that 

706
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:54,741
can get a normal look.
There's,

707
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:57,690
there's certain people that could get 
addicted to almost anything.

708
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,680
They have a mental illness.
It's a mental issue,

709
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,640
but there's a physical addiction is a 
completely different story.

710
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,460
You're not talking about some weird 
thing like washing your hands or playing

711
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:13,461
poker.
You're talking about something crazy 

712
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:13,980
where you've gotten your body physically
addicted.

713
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,760
This for its new system,
this is the system,

714
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:20,490
the system is heroin and terrorists runs
on.

715
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,720
It's like you have some business chick 
who's a clip was got a clipboard in 

716
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,700
their hand and she's like leading on a 
tour through your body.

717
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,070
We started incorporating heroine three 
years ago.

718
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,000
Without it,
we die,

719
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,550
you know,
so this is where the heroin comes in.

720
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:34,140
These are holes.
See this,

721
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:39,141
this is called gang green's.
What happened to you on 10 to your 

722
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,570
holes?
But you get someone hooked on something 

723
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,430
like that.
It's so hard for them to stop.

724
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,530
Yeah.
It's why it's the most evil thing in the

725
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:47,020
world to be selling.
Things like that.

726
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:49,960
Knowing that you don't have to,
you know,

727
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:55,020
knowing that this must be alternatives.
I understand there's some people that 

728
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,960
are in intense pain,
especially people that are about to die,

729
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,030
you know?
And maybe it'd be good for that.

730
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,440
Sure.
But for the most part,

731
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:00,040
most people,

732
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,190
well,
most people don't need it.

733
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,480
Shouldn't give them the.
Most people don't eat it.

734
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,620
Yeah.
So how did you engineer your back?

735
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,130
Uh,
it was like a genetic thing basically,

736
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:16,131
like out of pineal cyst on my tailbone,
so I had to get it like a 12 inch 

737
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,850
portion of my back taken out.
It sucks.

738
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,190
Oh my God.
It's all healed now.

739
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:23,250
But it was terrible for like 60.
You were a foot taller than you are now,

740
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,110
is that what you're saying?
I was actually eight feet and six 

741
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,110
inches.
Three years.

742
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,460
He was like a foot shorter.
Yeah,

743
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,050
they wouldn't let me play in the NBA 
anymore.

744
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,120
You,
um,

745
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,650
so this,
is this how you got involved with,

746
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:39,900
um,
like a,

747
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,960
like mind over body type shit in the 
first place because you were like that 

748
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
whole John Sarno type thing?
No,

749
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,410
what's up John Sarno was this guy.
Oh,

750
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:54,411
the,
the doctor that believes there's a mind 

751
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:54,660
body connection with back injuries and 
shit like that.

752
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:55,060
Have you ever heard?

753
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,630
Yes,
I have now.

754
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:57,490
I remember.
Um,

755
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,010
what do you believe?
I believe you do.

756
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,810
I believe it.
Yeah,

757
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:01,280
I think um,
I,

758
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:06,281
uh,
I feel like I didn't have much support 

759
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,340
back then and I think that's what the 
bank is support in your life.

760
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:10,100
You know what I mean?
So for me it's real.

761
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,480
I mean,
I don't know.

762
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,620
That's how I feel at least.

763
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,490
So you have this injury you haven't 
repaired?

764
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,590
Yeah.
And how long did it take before you were

765
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:18,350
like 100 percent.
Okay.

766
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,410
That was like,
I'm five months of,

767
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,880
of basically nothingness.

768
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,360
I'm asking you all these questions 
because I just discovered recently have 

769
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,670
a bulging disc.
I have a bulging disc in my back.

770
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:33,630
It's not bad.
It's not really bad.

771
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,870
Like I can still do,
I can do kickboxing and no problem.

772
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:39,030
I do all these strength and conditioning
exercises.

773
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,210
No problem.
My problem only comes when I do Jujitsu 

774
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,691
and I get my head yanked on that was 
going to say that again when you're 

775
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:50,631
defending from something it's because 
it's in the middle of my back and it's 

776
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:53,300
hustle found out to my posture is dog 
shit most was already.

777
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,040
So I'm trying to sit up straight and 
put,

778
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,190
you know,
it's like I sit like this all the time 

779
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,190
and apparently that's bad.

780
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,820
I'm the exact same way and I feel like I
don't like doing this because it feels 

781
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:03,820
like I'm just putting out my boobs saw 
the boy looks at it.

782
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,781
Yeah.
Especially I'm trying to look less 

783
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:08,781
Douchey,
not more Jewish.

784
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:09,800
This makes me look more Douchey,

785
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,730
like sitting straight up,
like I can be more chill like this,

786
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:17,731
you know what I'm saying?
But this is like way better for your 

787
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:17,731
body.
Sit Straight.

788
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:22,231
But then someone said this is John Sarno
book and then I should read it so I 

789
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,110
shouldn't really shouldn't comment until
I read it,

790
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,110
but.
But I'm not in pain like all the time.

791
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,470
It's a weird thing to try to describe to
people because it's like saying,

792
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:31,300
well it only hurts when I do two digits 
or they'll just say,

793
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,070
don't do Jujitsu.
I know exactly what you're saying,

794
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:38,071
but it's don't do.
Jujitsu is not really that much of an 

795
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:40,591
option for me.
It's been annoying that I haven't been 

796
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,571
able to do it regularly for the past 
five months while this thing has been 

797
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:45,731
healing up.
So I'm trying all sorts of different 

798
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:45,731
ways,
but I,

799
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,130
I know it's a real injury,
like that's the weird thing.

800
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,690
Like when someone says it's like,
you know,

801
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,070
senior mine man.
Well it may manifest the same.

802
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,980
Yeah,
I think it's like it may manifest itself

803
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:54,350
if you're thinking about it where you 
have issues in that area.

804
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:59,351
But who knows.
I mean that's hard though because it 

805
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:02,231
manifested itself defending a triangle 
guy was trying to fucking tapped me and 

806
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,320
I'm trying to get out and I'm using my 
back.

807
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,140
That's what it manifested itself.
I don't,

808
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,150
I just,
I'm not being defensive and to start 

809
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,150
starnell fans will jump in right now and
go,

810
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,300
come on.
Moon full could choose you.

811
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:17,180
Said you didn't.
I will read the book and I will read the

812
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:22,181
book with a 100 percent open mind.
But you can't tell me that that injury 

813
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:27,251
happened because of my mind or that 
there's pain because of my mind because 

814
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:30,020
I'm not really like a Weirdo and uh,
I'm not buying that shit.

815
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,720
Alright.
I don't have this like self hating thing

816
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:37,721
going on.
I don't have any tension as far as my 

817
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:38,420
life goes and I'm carrying in my back.
No,

818
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,790
I tried to get out of something and I 
hurt my back.

819
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,580
Sure.
Like this is like tissue and it tears,

820
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,640
so that's where like scientists go 
fucking bananas and a lot of medical 

821
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,300
doctors that replaced disks.
They go bananas when they hear this shit

822
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:50,960
like,
listen bitch,

823
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:54,200
you got bone on bone.
You don't have a desk anymore.

824
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,780
You're gonna be in pain,
period.

825
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,820
No matter what this guy says in his 
wacky book,

826
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,760
if you have like a real physical 
injuries back,

827
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:02,690
injuries are tricky,
man.

828
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,110
They're the worst I think because it's 
like,

829
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,630
well,
well he would be saying,

830
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,310
and I'm not saying he's wrong in saying 
this,

831
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:11,300
but what he would be saying by saying 
that somehow know that you control where

832
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:15,830
you're injured and control,
like where you feel pain because of your

833
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:16,790
emotional state.

834
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,110
What we're basically saying is that 
you're.

835
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:24,450
You're creating your life and your own 
imagination and your body is just one 

836
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,290
physical manifestation of you creating 
your own life,

837
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:32,410
which I'm not.
I'm not willing to argue with it may be 

838
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,381
very well the case,
but you if you want to carry the logic 

839
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:39,341
of thinking that your mind controls pain
and actual injuries aren't real or are 

840
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:43,961
created by your own mind,
well you've got to carry that all the 

841
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:43,961
way,
bitch.

842
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:47,860
You got to take that all away and say 
the universe is something that you're 

843
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,621
creating in your own mind because you're
talking about physical reality being 

844
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,770
manifested by the imagination and your 
intent.

845
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,410
Okay?
Well,

846
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,240
just because it's your body doesn't mean
it's any less crazy voodoo talk.

847
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,940
That's still crazy Voodoo talk and I'm 
not saying it's wrong,

848
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:04,270
but I'm saying if you believe that you 
really should take it to the utmost and 

849
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,270
say,
well,

850
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,000
we're living in a fucking dream.

851
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,270
Okay?
Life is your imagination manifested in 

852
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:10,730
some sort of a representation of a true 
form,

853
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:13,730
but there is no true form behind it.
We're getting deep.

854
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,860
It was.
That's the only way you're going to 

855
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:18,860
fucking tell me that your emotions and 
your,

856
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,350
your,
your mind is why you have a back pain.

857
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,850
Like maybe you got hit by a car bitch.
Okay?

858
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Know that's all possible to like this 
idea that there's this physical 

859
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:34,940
manifestation is because of your intent 
and because of your mind,

860
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:38,220
because of your emotions.
If that is even at possible,

861
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,590
then you've got to take that all the 
way.

862
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,710
That means your physical intent.
It's probably controlling everything.

863
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,220
It's probably not just controlling your 
body is probably controlling your 

864
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,260
environment as well.
If it's controlling your environment,

865
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,930
how much of it is how much everything 
outside of it is real?

866
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,340
That's a good question.

867
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,600
It's a great question.
I mean I put this on online and a lot of

868
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:00,150
people gave me a lot of really good 
advice,

869
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,450
so I wanted to thank them.
Especially dudes on the underground gave

870
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:06,990
me a lot of mixed martial arts.
Star comes the underground forum.

871
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:12,270
They gave me a lot of great advice on 
how to Rehab and Palati seems to come up

872
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:17,271
a lot.
Yoga seems to come up a lot and that 

873
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:17,271
book seems to come up a lot as well,
so I'm going to check it out.

874
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:17,770
Travolta,
backroads,

875
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:23,030
Travolta back,
rubs and fucking uncomfortable because 

876
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,030
you never know when it's Dick's coming 
out.

877
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,030
Hey,
you know,

878
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,420
if she would travolta would say,
Hey,

879
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,460
let me rub you theirs,
which is what his move was.

880
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,830
Do you know that there was one of the 
moves that he would do on the guys,

881
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,450
wasn't that efficient?

882
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,280
Auto Travolta,
a back rub lore.

883
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,980
Not that I'm hating the guy and I say,
listen man,

884
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:36,390
you knew what the fuck you were getting 
into.

885
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:41,391
If you're a professional background guy 
and you guys don't have like a website 

886
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:43,620
or something,
we can go and tell about which guys want

887
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:44,850
to get jerked off.
Okay.

888
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:48,690
If you don't have that by now and you 
and Travolta's come a new for 20 years,

889
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,310
that's on you.
Okay?

890
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,760
You guys need to either accept the job.
You know what he wants,

891
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,870
he wants you to jerk them off.
That's you're trying to diversify.

892
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,990
You saw pulp fiction,
jerk them off.

893
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,100
Just check them off.

894
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,920
I didn't talk about my backup.
I had the other day.

895
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,870
You shouldn't talk about it.
I sent and talk about that.

896
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,830
No,
no.

897
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,250
That's awesome.
The one that was in San Diego,

898
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,500
things can get closed down.
Yeah.

899
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,950
The one in San Diego,
right in the border.

900
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,130
Don't,
don't tell a story.

901
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,280
Stories,
a story.

902
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,680
We got to be careful about talking about
illegal shit as this patriot.

903
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:21,390
Hey,
it's,

904
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:23,650
it's made up.
I'm making it different.

905
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,940
We have to say that every story we tell 
alleged now on,

906
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,120
allegedly I say allegedly,
it's kind of cool.

907
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,210
Shut the fuck up.
Okay.

908
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,010
Just stop it right now.
I didn't know that existed.

909
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,420
So you're um,
uh,

910
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,720
who you working with right now with 
fighters you work on?

911
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,390
Just calmly and I talk.
I'm talking to Martin a little bit now.

912
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,370
And when you started working with 
Martin,

913
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,360
he was the first guy.

914
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,340
First Guy.
Yeah.

915
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,190
I just said,
hey,

916
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,420
you know,
I've never done this before.

917
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,220
I kind of want to experiment on 
somebody.

918
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:55,350
What made you like want to like reach 
out to a fighter and devise a while?

919
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,670
I love them.
I'm a number one.

920
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:59,640
It's like the purest form of competition
there is I think right now.

921
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,760
So that's why I love it because I'm very
competitive.

922
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,820
I grew up playing games and video games 
and poker is obviously a perfect choice 

923
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,410
for my lifestyle now.
Um,

924
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,450
but uh,
I don't know,

925
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:13,800
I just felt like doing something 
different,

926
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:14,250
man,
you know,

927
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,950
just,
just trying something new,

928
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,290
creating something out of nothing.
So.

929
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,900
And Martin Kemp was just like,
fuck it at me.

930
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:23,990
Like what did you say specifically 
there?

931
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:26,270
Really liked knocked him on his ass 
because like I said,

932
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,140
smart dude,
smart guy,

933
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,470
tough guy,
very successful fighter.

934
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,840
Like what did you say to him?
Okay.

935
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:36,910
Follow my solid champion inside of him 
and I wanted to be part of bringing it 

936
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:36,910
up.
Yeah,

937
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:36,910
I would think you were trying to fuck

938
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,100
me.
Wouldn't you say?

939
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,790
Wouldn't you say that?

940
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,790
Yeah,
let me come over and get some Chardonnay

941
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,210
back massages and uh,
yeah,

942
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:46,820
yeah,
it doesn't sound.

943
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,310
You would just assume

944
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,780
some bad sex was going on,
you know,

945
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,600
maybe Martin Kampmann just thought of it
as a sparring session.

946
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:59,601
Like,
this dude is going to come on my house 

947
00:38:59,601 --> 00:38:59,601
trying to get some butts X.
I'm going to light them up.

948
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,470
And in the way,
all the way,

949
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,160
he actually got some great,
great advice.

950
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,140
It could be like an ABC after school 
special.

951
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,770
He thought he was gonna.
Get some free sparring in.

952
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,790
I told him I wasn't going to talk about 
that on the podcast about the butts.

953
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,630
That's all what we already established 
that everything we say is fiction.

954
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,430
So don't worry about it.
Martin,

955
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,550
your secret's safe with us.
Ariel,

956
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,430
is that guy always a girl?
If it's got a big area.

957
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,280
He's a boy rather.
No,

958
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,850
the only big role is or girls.
Puerto Ricans have used a few.

959
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:31,440
Cute.
Have you ever seen a man with really big

960
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,890
areas?
Oh my God.

961
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:38,720
Are you kidding?
This big as your face is Ariel Leo's.

962
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,600
Could you?
Yeah.

963
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:42,000
You could wear them as a mask.
Rabobank.

964
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,960
Oh,
that's cool.

965
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,610
Yeah,
he's a big boy.

966
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,810
Magic wearing a bike helmet with this 
aerial is on the side.

967
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,510
What's the biggest Ariel's you've ever 
seen a girl?

968
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,110
Oh,
there was.

969
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:54,260
This one was a sad story that somebody 
sent me the other day.

970
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Uh,
it's this girl that was at playboy 

971
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,810
playboy model in the seventies or 
eighties.

972
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,750
And she was like super famous,
very beautiful,

973
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,880
and she recently died in San Francisco,
like on the streets as a homeless person

974
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:12,881
and stuff.
And it just shows her like how she used 

975
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:14,080
to look and imagine her life going there
in 20 years or whatever.

976
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,690
No,
it's fucked up somewhere in her life.

977
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,990
Some guy probably if it,
if not set it,

978
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:25,020
at least thought I hope that bitch ones 
up old and homeless and living on the 

979
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,130
street with no one to love her.
You know what I mean?

980
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,660
I hope she dies in a car accident,
you know?

981
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,200
Oh,
someone.

982
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,170
Someone wished that to Brian.
I was just saying.

983
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,270
Yeah,
this one's how rude.

984
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,300
So silly.
That's never should hope no one ever 

985
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,640
dies ever in a car accident for the rest
of the time.

986
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,310
A great show.
You reptilian skin lady.

987
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,560
Um,
but whatever.

988
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,950
Yeah.
Putting that kind of intense.

989
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,780
Oh,
did you hear about Lindsay Lohan is like

990
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,200
really pissed off at the scary movie 
five trailer they just had,

991
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,370
has charlie sheen in it.
And let me tell you something.

992
00:40:55,371 --> 00:41:00,371
I don't give a fuck,
but Kat Williams Williams is in this 

993
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:01,670
trailer and it makes me wonder if this 
whole Katt Williams thing,

994
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:05,990
which some brilliant fucking marketing 
thing because if you look at it,

995
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,080
it's like a miniature early when look at
it and Kat Williams is in it.

996
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,560
If you want to play it.
Look,

997
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:15,561
I'm a big Cat Williams fan and when I 
see Kat Williams getting in trouble and 

998
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:16,920
all this shit that,
you know why that drives me nuts because

999
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:20,520
I want to hear some new standup.
I think that guy's a brilliant comedian.

1000
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:25,521
He's one of my favorites,
so when I see them it makes me sad like 

1001
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:28,641
I can't.
I don't take any joy in watching that 

1002
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:28,641
guy fall apart.
Eric,

1003
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:29,280
check this out if he's falling apart,
but if it's all fake,

1004
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,500
see if it's.
What do you think?

1005
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,060
Because it's.
I don't think,

1006
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,070
I don't think

1007
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,100
you would ever like do that.
His fans.

1008
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:37,910
If it was all fake.

1009
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:47,030
Someone else.
Killer open front door.

1010
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:55,810
There's no need for that

1011
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,480
bitch.

1012
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,420
Stop.
Stop.

1013
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,300
This movie could give you aids that you 
might get aids just watching this 

1014
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,661
trailer.
I know this might be the worst movie 

1015
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:22,301
ever.
Tell me if you think this is really 

1016
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:22,301
Leonardo Dicaprio.

1017
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:24,660
Of course it starts to.
It starts off,

1018
00:42:24,661 --> 00:42:27,840
so loony tunes and it starts off really 
shitty.

1019
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,050
Then it gets kind of like interesting 
professional,

1020
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:37,780
personal demon residue.
Damon's got to the bottom of this.

1021
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,090
I was told you needed a dream extract.
This goes in your mouth.

1022
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:53,020
The other one goes in your rectum.
Hang on.

1023
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,140
I'm sorry.
That one goes in your mouth and the 

1024
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,941
other one goes in your record.
That lady told me there's always some 

1025
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:07,440
ballerina who won't give up the 
spotlight.

1026
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,350
I danced the swan when I was pregnant 
with you.

1027
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,220
This is not badly.
Don't inhale

1028
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,300
judy footage that the old owner.
Stop this right now.

1029
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,170
This is the craziest.
Okay.

1030
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,370
Charlie Sheen is in bed with Lindsay 
Lohan.

1031
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Lindsay Lohan's not mad that she's 
getting portrayed as fucking Charlie 

1032
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Sheen.
Let's.

1033
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Let's just say,
by the way,

1034
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,540
is this like what she had to do to get 
payback?

1035
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,930
Not Lindsay.
Lindsay,

1036
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,730
Lindsay Lohan.
This is Charlie Sheen.

1037
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,140
Charlie Sheen just paid like Lindsey's 
taxes.

1038
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,390
I don't know if you've been following 
that whole Charlie Sheen thing,

1039
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,810
so maybe this is payback.
She has to do this film,

1040
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,080
but they fucking own her because they 
originally sent in this scene that 

1041
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,120
they're going to.
The joke is that you're working for this

1042
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:58,121
stupid fucking movie or something.
I'm not working for the olive garden or 

1043
00:43:58,121 --> 00:43:58,300
not working for this movie.
Uh,

1044
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,540
but,
but then I guess,

1045
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:04,630
uh,
they originally said was supposed to be 

1046
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,101
for Herbie.
Herbie supposed to be on their TV and 

1047
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:06,101
they changed it to report them for 
sessions.

1048
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,730
Scared.
There's nothing to be.

1049
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:17,731
Sorry.
I gotta call you back.

1050
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Right.
Which I guess that was.

1051
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,280
Oh,
oh my God,

1052
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,690
that looks horrible.
Shame is the scary

1053
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,750
was thinking that that clip is like 
this,

1054
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,960
these,
these constant jokes too.

1055
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:42,150
Fucking up.
I've come back from worse than this.

1056
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:47,151
Like this,
this constant playing off the fact that 

1057
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,701
he's like this consummate partier who 
rebounds and it's starting to be like 

1058
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:49,701
parents.

1059
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:51,470
It's scary.
You can't just keep it.

1060
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,360
You can't just keep it

1061
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:57,410
doing that.
Keep talking about being a fuck up and 

1062
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:57,410
bouncing back.
Like you've got to actually do something

1063
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:57,410
now,
Dude.

1064
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,030
Yeah.
That's the scariest pre that.

1065
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,940
That is scary.

1066
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,850
That's what I'm saying.
Carrie Williams isn't it?

1067
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,470
And that.
What's scary is that

1068
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,570
people were willing to make that movie.
Like they saw it and they glued it all 

1069
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:08,900
together and they're like,
well,

1070
00:45:08,901 --> 00:45:09,920
I'm fucking.
This is.

1071
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:10,680
This is pretty funny.

1072
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,760
Whoever's in that,
whoever made that movie is like a 

1073
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:16,760
genius.
It's just sitting there going,

1074
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,140
Andy Dick,

1075
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,650
that's pure madness.
That movie is pure madness that you will

1076
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,440
leave that movie baffled.
Maybe.

1077
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,910
Maybe you love it.
What the fuck do I know?

1078
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,680
Don't take your opinions for me,
ladies and gentlemen,

1079
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,980
but I hope that that Kat Williams did 
gets his shit together or if he does 

1080
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,800
have his shit together,
I hope he explains himself.

1081
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,950
I think he's fucking hilarious comedian,
man.

1082
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,280
You go back and watch the pimp 
chronicles.

1083
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,780
It's really funny.
Shit,

1084
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:42,250
man.
It's fun to watch.

1085
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,620
He was good man.
He was really good.

1086
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,520
I hope he's still is.
You know,

1087
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,000
I hope he can bounce back.
I don't know what it is.

1088
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,910
I wouldn't want to guess as to what is 
happening to them,

1089
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,940
what happened to them.
I don't even know about all these like 

1090
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,550
cancelled shows not showing up and 
beating people up and shit sounds 

1091
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,290
normal.
I don't know fucking dudes.

1092
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,430
Larry,
I'll tell you that.

1093
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,270
I think you got to be a certain amount 
of crazy to be able to pull off comedy,

1094
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,420
you know,
especially pulled off like at Joey Diaz 

1095
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,601
levels or fucking cat Williams levels or
even Brian Cowen levels probably counts 

1096
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:16,390
fucking crazy.

1097
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,980
You know?
It's fucking awesome.

1098
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,470
And do you ever talk to Steven Wright 
ever heard?

1099
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,000
I was listening to his comedy the other 
day.

1100
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,160
He is a hilarious course.

1101
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,700
I saw that guy live like way back in the
day when he first started making it 

1102
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,590
before I was even a comedian.
I paid to see him live and I was,

1103
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,270
I was like 18 or 19 years old.
I went to see him in a concert.

1104
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,830
It was amazing.

1105
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:41,290
He said something like,
he was on this on an airplane the other 

1106
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:41,290
day and you forgot to take the seat belt
when he stood up,

1107
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,260
and then he's like,
yeah,

1108
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:47,310
I was dragging that F or did this 
airplane around the lobby knocking 

1109
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:47,310
people over with my wings.

1110
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:55,410
He had a great joke about working out of
a fire extinguisher factory.

1111
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,220
Couldn't park anywhere near the place.
Just that kind of style.

1112
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,160
Yeah.
He was the guy that,

1113
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:06,540
um,
there was um,

1114
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:11,541
a movie that was written about or that 
was made about standing up called when 

1115
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:15,621
stand standup stood out and he was the 
guy that really like changed the whole 

1116
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:18,480
face of the Boston scene because he got 
discovered and when he got discovered,

1117
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:19,910
they were putting them on television all
the time.

1118
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,110
Then all of a sudden everybody else 
wanted to get discovered to.

1119
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,580
And it sort of changed it from everybody
was just going out and trying to kill,

1120
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,890
just be the funniest people you could to
everybody wanting to try to get a TV.

1121
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:34,210
So he likes sort of by his success,
unfortunately tanked the entire boss.

1122
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,510
He was the first step in the entire 
Boston comedy scene.

1123
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:39,490
Slowly degenerating over time.

1124
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,350
I don't get steven right in my face 
though,

1125
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,190
like know how you get Louis C,
k everywhere he goes.

1126
00:47:43,191 --> 00:47:43,900
Let me see.
Katie,

1127
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,900
you know,
David Tomlinson,

1128
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,140
but I don't see him at all.
One of the reasons is that

1129
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,280
was not nearly as prolific as Louis.
One of the things that so amazing about 

1130
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,380
Louise,
not just that he's funny,

1131
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,650
but he's so prolific,
like Louis puts out a whole new hour 

1132
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,670
every year and he's constantly writing 
and because of that,

1133
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,800
you're,
if you're a fan,

1134
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,570
like I'm a fan of Steven,
right?

1135
00:48:05,571 --> 00:48:07,070
But was the last time I saw Steven 
Wright,

1136
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:08,760
special ones last time,
you know,

1137
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:12,410
uh,
I downloaded one of his mp3s.

1138
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:17,470
It's very,
very rare because he only has a certain 

1139
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:17,470
body of work and I'm through with that.
I've already eaten through it.

1140
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,940
Whereas with a guy like Louis,
if you're a fan,

1141
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:23,480
you're continually refreshed with new 
stuff.

1142
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,760
Like every year you're going to get a 
whole new hour.

1143
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,620
You're going to get all these interviews
in between.

1144
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,410
So it's like you,
the relationship between the fan and the

1145
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:31,850
comedian,
like it makes sense.

1146
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,950
It doesn't make sense that I'm still 
fans with Steven Wright are fans of 

1147
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,950
Stephen.
Right.

1148
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,000
But I haven't heard any of this shit in 
a long time.

1149
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,930
But if he was like a dude like Louie,
that was like banging it out every year.

1150
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,520
Like an hour every year.
Yeah.

1151
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,130
He would hear about them everywhere.
It's not that he's not hilarious.

1152
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,710
He's awesome.
Just doesn't work that much.

1153
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,990
A Sitcom with Steven Wright and Katt 
Williams and they're gay levers and it's

1154
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,090
perfect because Kat Williams never 
slapped steven.

1155
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:56,560
Right.
Because he's a tall and stuff,

1156
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,540
you know,
probably wouldn't slap them as much.

1157
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,800
Steven Meisel,
dancehall,

1158
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,690
he's pretty tall,
isn't he?

1159
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,770
Williams was standing on the couch and 
smack in your face,

1160
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:03,320
right?

1161
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:05,500
Yeah.
Coming.

1162
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,430
You see on the video,
pop it at Walmart employee.

1163
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:09,870
He'll smack you.

1164
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,740
Usually what Kat said Walmart employee 
was saying to him that way.

1165
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:18,741
Slap him.
He called him the n word and that's why 

1166
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:18,741
I slapped him.
I don't believe that at all,

1167
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:18,741
but I

1168
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:19,570
might have.
You might have.

1169
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,480
And if he didn't,
that's the right thing to say if you 

1170
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,320
want to get out of it,
I guess that too.

1171
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,900
Anyway,
back to Matt.

1172
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,610
A little bit random access,
but hey man,

1173
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,830
I'm enjoying it.
That's how a real conversation is,

1174
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:40,831
you know,
we'll conversations don't always go the 

1175
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:40,831
same way.
The,

1176
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:40,831
you,
um,

1177
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:44,970
when you,
when you started working with Martin 

1178
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:44,970
Kampmann,
did you come up with like something that

1179
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,780
you wrote down on paper?
Like easily,

1180
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,410
uh,
the ways to address it?

1181
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:49,990
Did you develop like a curriculum?
Like how did you,

1182
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,800
uh,
how'd you approach it?

1183
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:55,830
It's hard to do that because it just 
depends so much on every different 

1184
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:55,830
person.
You know what I mean?

1185
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,820
Depends on how much time do you want.
We usually spend like,

1186
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:59,350
I would say a half hour now.
What?

1187
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:01,750
I mean advanced to work with them before
a fight.

1188
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:02,830
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1189
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:04,420
About two months.
In two months.

1190
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:07,720
Yeah.
So d all through like heavy training.

1191
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:08,950
You're there?
Yeah.

1192
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:13,450
I mean I don't go to his gym that much.
I went to extreme for a couple of times,

1193
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:16,810
just kinda hung out and just saw his 
body language and stuff like that,

1194
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:19,290
but mostly it's just on the phone or 
I'll go over to his house and we'll have

1195
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,180
of chat it out and see what's on his 
mind and you know,

1196
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,320
just try to get it off there.
And um,

1197
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:25,330
you,
uh,

1198
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,990
did you develop legere course for how 
to,

1199
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:28,990
how you handle this kind of

1200
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,590
man?
I'm still so new to this.

1201
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:33,420
I don't even know what I'm doing.
Sometimes you just have

1202
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,190
some really good ideas about being able 
to be in the moment.

1203
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,300
Yeah,
the bottom line is just getting them 

1204
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,300
present.
That's the only thing that I'm concerned

1205
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,991
about is just getting them to the point 
where they're not thinking about their 

1206
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:48,781
acts or whatever's on their mind where 
they can just be in that cage and all 

1207
00:50:48,781 --> 00:50:49,550
that matters is what's in front of them 
because if they go,

1208
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:50,650
if they,
like I said,

1209
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:55,651
we talked about before,
one second away from the moment they're 

1210
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:55,651
gone,
they could get knocked out,

1211
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,400
you know?
So

1212
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,040
what is like,
can you tell us like what's a,

1213
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,140
what's a good way?
Like say if you've got something on your

1214
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:07,141
mind that's fucking with you,
what's a good way to get that out of 

1215
00:51:07,141 --> 00:51:07,930
your mind to smoke,
smoke weed and deal with it?

1216
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,400
Smoke weed and deal with it.

1217
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:10,270
No,
I mean,

1218
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,750
do you know that's a joke.
But uh,

1219
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,860
I'm not as funny as you.
I'm trying.

1220
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,710
Okay.
You gave it a shot.

1221
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:15,300
Yeah.
Thank you.

1222
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,840
Um,
yeah,

1223
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,160
I mean just,
just to deal with it.

1224
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,030
Most people,
like I said,

1225
00:51:19,031 --> 00:51:21,070
they'll push it aside,
they'll pretend like it's not there.

1226
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,120
Right.
But for some people it's not that easy 

1227
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,120
to just deal with things like I'll just,
I mean,

1228
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,210
is there a tool that you could give 
someone,

1229
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,460
you know,
like that they could take away like,

1230
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,230
oh,
let me look at it this way now.

1231
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:34,500
Instead it was like maybe a loss loss in
the family,

1232
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:35,970
the loss of a pad or something like 
that.

1233
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:40,971
You know,
for a lot of people that shit is like 

1234
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:40,971
absolutely devastating.
It's really hard for them to move on.

1235
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:41,740
Right.
Do you what,

1236
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:47,090
what do you do?
Like if you're dealing with a fighter 

1237
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:47,090
and he has an issue,
whatever it is,

1238
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:47,850
girlfriend,
issue,

1239
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:49,020
loss,
issue,

1240
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,900
whatever it is,
how do you get them to like,

1241
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,800
let that truck go.

1242
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:58,180
You got to get them to go back to that 
moment and live it again because they 

1243
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,631
haven't got,
they're not okay with it one way or 

1244
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:01,631
another.
They're just not okay with it,

1245
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:02,960
so they have to go back and really go 
through what was going on.

1246
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:03,710
So in,
you know,

1247
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,520
so you feel that a lot of times when 
people keep things in their mind or 

1248
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,670
distractions,
it's unresolved issues.

1249
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,520
It is absolutely.
Mostly from childhood actually.

1250
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

1251
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,840
Now how do you address that?
You say do,

1252
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,210
like when you're,
when you're working with a fighter,

1253
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,390
do you dress like specific areas of 
their child that.

1254
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,500
I mean,
how far do you go with that?

1255
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,230
Well,
they,

1256
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,500
it'll come up in conversation,
you know,

1257
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:32,590
they'll one way or another they'll tell 
me like what the issue is and then we'd 

1258
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:32,590
just go deal with it.
I mean,

1259
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,870
it's,
it's hard though because a lot of people

1260
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:35,220
don't want to do that.
They don't want to deal with.

1261
00:52:35,221 --> 00:52:37,290
They've been living with it for so long.
They're just like,

1262
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,030
you know,
that's the way it is for them.

1263
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,120
Yeah.
It's like,

1264
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:42,870
it makes it difficult for them to,
uh,

1265
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,760
to Sorta if they let it go like that.
If the game's over.

1266
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,150
Yeah.

1267
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,370
Phil let it go.
The game's over.

1268
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:50,860
They don't get because they're mostly,
they're getting something out of it.

1269
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,420
That's the reason why they keep doing 
it.

1270
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,700
Even as a traumatic experience or 
something bad.

1271
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
They're getting something out of it,
whether it be people feeling bad for 

1272
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,521
them or whatever it is for them.
There'll be getting something out of it 

1273
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:03,670
until they can let that go and,
and that game and move on.

1274
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,270
It's just gonna.
It's like groundhog day over and over.

1275
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:12,450
Yeah.
When you meet someone and they have an 

1276
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:13,030
issue like that and they keep repeating 
and it's so fucking frustrated.

1277
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,130
Yes.
It's so frustrating.

1278
00:53:15,131 --> 00:53:16,490
I went through it.
Um,

1279
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,300
I've gone through it a couple times with
my friends with drugs,

1280
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,060
you know,
and a,

1281
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,380
or an o or alcohol,
you know,

1282
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,920
when someone has just got that where 
they will,

1283
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:29,040
they'll get sober for a couple months 
and then they fuck up and then,

1284
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,200
you know,
it's like,

1285
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,750
like literally,
like they're stuck in like a,

1286
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,280
any like what are you doing?
Like,

1287
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,250
why are you in this little track?
This is a terrible track,

1288
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,960
you know,
the maze,

1289
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,510
you know,
you can just go that way.

1290
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,710
You can just have to.
Yeah,

1291
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:46,170
this is your fucking crazy.
Put it down.

1292
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,760
Pretend you're talking to yourself on 
the table.

1293
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,780
What would you tell yourself to do?
Would you tell yourself to keep 

1294
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:53,780
repeating these same stupid fucking 
patterns?

1295
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,920
He went to yourself for advice.
But that's a weird thing with people.

1296
00:53:56,921 --> 00:54:01,921
So a lot of people were good about 
giving advice but their own life,

1297
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,560
they can't follow that know.
Me Too sometimes.

1298
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:05,180
Look,
I'm human.

1299
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:06,330
It happens with me too,
you know?

1300
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,140
Oh,
for sure.

1301
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:07,750
Yeah.
You know?

1302
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,290
Yeah.
It's,

1303
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,340
it's hard.
It's hard to turn that same.

1304
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:16,510
You know,
when you look at other people you can 

1305
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:16,510
look at,
I'm pretty objective.

1306
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:16,510
You're not attached to their success or 
failure.

1307
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:19,010
You see them for what they are for the 
most part or what you know,

1308
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,600
what they represent to you,
but yourself.

1309
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:27,600
That's hard to do that.
Most people don't want to deal with 

1310
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:27,600
their own issues.
You know,

1311
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,760
lady.
That's why people give advice all the 

1312
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:30,760
time because they don't want to look 
inward and really work on themselves and

1313
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,920
a song that they would play on like zoom
or one of those little kid shows.

1314
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:41,370
The most important person in the whole 
wide world is you and you're hardly even

1315
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:42,900
know you.
You remember that?

1316
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,020
I don't,
but I don't remember it either that 

1317
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,020
barely remember it.
I remember that line.

1318
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,480
Remember like,
what was I was six going,

1319
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:52,410
what is this bitch talking about?
Don't even know me.

1320
00:54:52,411 --> 00:54:54,420
I know me well.
You don't know you.

1321
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,300
They don't project your bullshit on me.
Six years old,

1322
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:58,720
I fucking know me.
All right.

1323
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:04,850
The most important person in the whole 
life or help you in your even know you.

1324
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,340
Very difficult for people to look at 
themselves though.

1325
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,260
That's uh,
that's one of the hardest things to do.

1326
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:15,870
Straighten out your own issues.
The thing about fighting is that the 

1327
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,810
stakes are so insanely high that there's
even more pressure.

1328
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:22,260
It's because it's not just a loss like 
for a regular person,

1329
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:27,261
like say if you like to play basketball,
if you have a one on one game with the 

1330
00:55:27,261 --> 00:55:27,261
guy and you're pretty sure you could 
beat them,

1331
00:55:27,261 --> 00:55:30,330
but you fuck up some clutch shots and 
that is,

1332
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,620
you know,
it doesn't feel good.

1333
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,090
He's a clown.
You make it funny,

1334
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:34,710
funnier.
He smoked you in basketball.

1335
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,960
But that is so much better than losing a
fight.

1336
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,540
The losing a fight.
The emotional.

1337
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Yeah.
The emotional aspect of it is so 

1338
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:44,680
devastating to a lot of those guys.
Oh Man.

1339
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,350
Especially with Egos,
because look,

1340
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,630
we all have egos one way or another 
mostly.

1341
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,660
But with fighting it's like you're 
losing in front of that many people and 

1342
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:53,660
you've got to go back to the drawing 
board.

1343
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,720
You know,
you're not going to get a title shot now

1344
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:57,030
for a couple of fights.
You Know Martin was right there,

1345
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:57,840
you know?
Yeah.

1346
00:55:57,841 --> 00:56:02,841
Especially in a situation where you 
don't like the guy and you guys have a 

1347
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:06,060
lot of emotions invested in the fight 
and then the guy goes out and chaos.

1348
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,680
That gets ugly.
Well,

1349
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:09,240
you can't do that.
That's one of the things I teach.

1350
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,950
You cannot think about that stuff and 
not get emotionally invested.

1351
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,530
If you get emotionally invested,
you're done.

1352
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,120
Yeah.
That's so important.

1353
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,720
With a lot of things.
It's important with even with art,

1354
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,600
you know,
like you gotta like you gotta be able to

1355
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:27,020
let the exist outside of,
of you know,

1356
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,030
any,
any of your own bullshit,

1357
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,010
you know,
to let it just,

1358
00:56:31,011 --> 00:56:34,730
you gotta you can't get wrapped up and 
this motherfucker's eyeballing me,

1359
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,460
bitch.
You really are.

1360
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,800
You're going to be the one that shoots 
first,

1361
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:41,210
like all that nonsense can't exist in 
order for you to perform optimally.

1362
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:46,310
It can never grow if you order a few to 
execute the technique and the best way 

1363
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,170
and to not have all this extra baggage 
attached to your,

1364
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,350
your performance.
Because when people don't understand is 

1365
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:53,480
that this is a very important thing your
mind,

1366
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:58,481
and I know this specifically because 
I've spent so much time in sensory 

1367
00:56:58,671 --> 00:57:02,480
deprivation tanks,
this is a really big,

1368
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:05,000
big,
big thing in my life,

1369
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,050
is,
uh,

1370
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:11,170
the,
the ability to separate and get a look 

1371
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:16,000
at what the fuck is really going on with
all of your thoughts and all of your 

1372
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:19,280
intentions when you're by yourself with 
no distractions,

1373
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,520
because if you have any distractions,
so it distraction is an unnecessary 

1374
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,340
element to a situation.

1375
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:30,550
If there's a situation and there's all 
this ego attached with you and this guy 

1376
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,400
fighting that did not need to be there,
well you've,

1377
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,340
you've added,
you might still beat the guy,

1378
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,520
but you've added a layer of difficulty 
to this equation that didn't exist 

1379
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,151
before and you focus resources on it and
you only have a certain amount of 

1380
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:43,151
resources.

1381
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:45,820
And guess who created that?
You didn't always.

1382
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,880
The thing about the isolation tank is 
that you,

1383
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,980
you really,
truly understand when your body is 

1384
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,831
separated from any sensory input,
how much resources are going to that?

1385
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,280
That will also affect consciousness 
because if you have to deal your,

1386
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,340
your mind is managing space as you're 
moving around,

1387
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:05,860
like bumping into objects and opening 
doors and your,

1388
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:10,870
your mind is managing all this as well 
as communicating with people and you 

1389
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,340
don't feel like you're in any way taxed 
or stressed,

1390
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,520
but when you're in an environment where 
there's none of that going on,

1391
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,770
the sensory deprivation tank being at 
the same temperatures,

1392
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:23,790
your skin,
you're floating in there so there's 

1393
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:23,790
nothing come in into your skin and your 
skin.

1394
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,730
You feel like you're flying through the 
universe.

1395
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,740
You don't feel anything.
You don't see anything.

1396
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:27,710
It's pitch black.
You know,

1397
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,000
hearing your ears are underwater so 
there's nothing coming in and everything

1398
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:36,030
seems so clear.
It's like there's no distractions there 

1399
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,541
anymore.
There's just your thoughts and then you 

1400
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:39,541
look at it and you're like,
yeah,

1401
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:43,711
what the fuck am I doing?
Like why don't I get out of this 

1402
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:43,711
relationship?
Why don't I stop drinking?

1403
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:47,170
Why don't I quit smoking cigarettes?
Why do I keep gambling my paycheck away?

1404
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:49,930
What the fuck?
Inside that environment,

1405
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,240
those answers seem like so obvious.

1406
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:52,880
Yeah.
Well,

1407
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:54,680
what you just said is as perfect way to 
put it.

1408
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:59,710
There's so much going on in our lives.
We don't even take a moment to look 

1409
00:58:59,710 --> 00:58:59,710
inward,
you know,

1410
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,581
we're either driving somewhere or we're 
eating and talking to somebody or 

1411
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:03,770
whatever we're doing and then we're 
sleeping,

1412
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:05,030
you know,
you never really have that time.

1413
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:07,520
So being in the deprivation tank is 
definitely huge.

1414
00:59:07,521 --> 00:59:10,250
I've tried it a couple times,
actually done in Venice at the float lab

1415
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:11,660
up.
They just,

1416
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:13,190
uh,
just that guy's nuts,

1417
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,300
man.
The dude who runs a float lab crash.

1418
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,730
Yeah.
And there's,

1419
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:22,790
there's like,
there's a community of people all 

1420
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,831
throughout world that create these 
sensory deprivation tanks and there's 

1421
00:59:25,831 --> 00:59:26,460
some very good models.
There's A.

1422
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:27,660
I had,
um,

1423
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,970
a Samadhi that was my first one and uh,
I,

1424
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:33,120
I,
I enjoyed that thing very much.

1425
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,610
I had great experiences in that tank.
It's very adequate,

1426
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,940
but the level of sophistication and 
technology that this crazy motherfucker 

1427
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,711
puts in to his shit crashes systems are 
like 100 years in the future.

1428
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:50,100
The amount of filtration that's in them,
the ozone and nobody.

1429
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,860
No one else has anywhere near what he's 
doing.

1430
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:58,010
He put in this giant control panel.
I had to get it hardwired into the room 

1431
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,930
where the tank is.
The whole thing is fucking crazy.

1432
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:05,931
It's huge.
It's eight feet high and six feet wide 

1433
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:05,931
and nine feet long.
Yeah,

1434
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,130
I mean it's a gigantic fucking.
I mean he,

1435
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:08,790
he's.

1436
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:13,590
He takes everything to this crazy.
So now the newest version of the tanks,

1437
01:00:13,591 --> 01:00:15,330
they were.
The experience is still the same.

1438
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,390
He just wants to make sure that the 
water is as pure as it can be.

1439
01:00:18,391 --> 01:00:20,130
The distractions are minimal.
The,

1440
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:22,920
there's no light that gets in at all,
but when you,

1441
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:27,921
when you,
when you have this experience on a 

1442
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:27,921
regular basis,
you're really.

1443
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:31,470
It makes it puts into perspective why 
people do certain things where they just

1444
01:00:31,471 --> 01:00:33,720
keep doing them.
I'm a momentum and impulse,

1445
01:00:33,721 --> 01:00:38,400
like pull into Dunkin donuts or get some
fucking dead to horrible fatty foods and

1446
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:41,310
stuff your face and you just fill a hole
for a second and then you're like,

1447
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:42,750
fuck,
I'm going to go to the gym tonight.

1448
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:47,950
You know?
And then you keep repeating this 

1449
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,491
pattern,
but note that you're repeating it with 

1450
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:52,071
actions.
That's what's really strange because 

1451
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:53,700
actions also require resources and when 
you have an issue,

1452
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:55,530
when you have something that's fucking 
with your mind,

1453
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,490
a lot of times you will eat up the 
resources so that you don't have to deal

1454
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:01,890
with it because the pressure of dealing 
with it is scary to you.

1455
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,750
So you create this sort of artificial 
situation by actions.

1456
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:11,580
That's why meditative time time,
whether it's just doing,

1457
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:16,730
sitting down and concentrating on your 
breathing and just trying to clear your 

1458
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:20,931
mind or actually doing something or even
hiking where like a lot of people think 

1459
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,330
hiking is like a meditative sort of a 
breathing thing because you're,

1460
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,720
as you're moving all your completely 
concentrating on that and your life sort

1461
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:28,860
of goes away and the stress of it all 
sort of goes away

1462
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,360
is living.
Yeah,

1463
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,610
you know it.
Do you know how he's like a.

1464
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:38,670
He rents them out for hour so he should 
the mix like massage with flotation tank

1465
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:43,240
imagines is laying there and having 
another girl in a bathing suit just give

1466
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,040
you like a real time massage while in 
the flotation tank.

1467
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:51,010
Can't that way?
The whole thing doesn't really work that

1468
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:56,011
way.
And when you want to see her you 

1469
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:57,991
wouldn't want to.
You know what if she looks like Gollum 

1470
01:01:57,991 --> 01:01:57,991
when you maybe the one of the things you
get to pick.

1471
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,290
Yeah,
I don't think that plus the tank only 11

1472
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:07,030
inches deep.
Like she can't really do that.

1473
01:02:07,031 --> 01:02:08,740
You would design it so like your,
your,

1474
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,650
you can breathe in another planet where 
gravity gravity's definitely make no.

1475
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,320
Just one answer.
You can breathe underwater.

1476
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,270
It's like it's a ramp like where it goes
up so your.

1477
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,140
It wouldn't work to see if that's silly 
because if it's a ramp

1478
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,990
you would be sloshing around in there.
The woman.

1479
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:26,160
That would ruin the whole idea of a 
sensory deprivation.

1480
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:31,200
Yeah.
Unless you're laying on like some like 

1481
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,001
fleshlight material all the way in it.
Like the whole thing's flashlight 

1482
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,570
inside.
Like why don't they make us feel good in

1483
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:39,571
your Dick?
But it wouldn't feel so good on your 

1484
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:39,571
face.
You'd be like,

1485
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:39,571
what the fuck is this rubbery thing on 
my face?

1486
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:44,280
Fleshlight blankets you.
It feels good in your deck because your 

1487
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,360
Dick is so crazy at Dick's willing to go
into assholes readily.

1488
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:49,510
One of the girls like put it in my ass.
You know your Dixon idiot.

1489
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,070
Your Dick is essentially

1490
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,240
being shit.
Walls all over itself.

1491
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:58,270
Your Dick is a fool.
There's a big difference between that 

1492
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:58,910
and what you're willing to do with your 
face.

1493
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:04,090
Like most people,
most respectful people and not rub a 

1494
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:04,820
shit wall,
a wall where all the shit passes by.

1495
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,620
He wouldn't take a rub it all over your 
skin,

1496
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,390
but your Dick is like,

1497
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,240
oh yeah,
love it baby.

1498
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,330
For Christmas I got dolphin,
a vib dolphin encounter.

1499
01:03:14,331 --> 01:03:19,331
I get to swim with the dolphins and 
hugged the dolphins and I know like I'm 

1500
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:19,970
planning it out already where I'm going 
to put my head against a dolphin.

1501
01:03:19,971 --> 01:03:21,180
Just be like,
fuck me right now.

1502
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:24,380
Fuck me and see if he can read my mind.
Like,

1503
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,030
what?
Have you done that yet?

1504
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:27,770
What are you talking about them?
We'd done it yet.

1505
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,960
No,
I haven't done that.

1506
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,770
Swim with the dolphins at Avi.
Tried like any,

1507
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:33,890
like hacking to the doctor,
talking to the dolphins.

1508
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:39,610
Do you have a broken brain?
Like you know what Mckenna like sat 

1509
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,660
there and fucking took acid with.
When would you try any mini experiments?

1510
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:44,640
It was first of all,
as John Lilly Lilly today.

1511
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,760
What's going on?
Did you smoke through?

1512
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,160
I've been sick for three days.
I was sick,

1513
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,860
you know,
for Christmas and the day before.

1514
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,590
Thank you.
Still sick,

1515
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:54,170
go back to the doctor,
tell them to focus on your brain.

1516
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:56,840
Now this what you just said,
listen to what?

1517
01:03:56,841 --> 01:03:59,060
Like a rational person having a 
conversation.

1518
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:00,350
You're like,
you don't go to the dolphins.

1519
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,060
You fuck the shit out of you right now.
People know.

1520
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:08,110
What are you saying?
Like when you first hung out with a dog 

1521
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:08,110
or when you hang out with dogs,
you know,

1522
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:13,001
you always sit there and like you read 
my mind and I know every experiment with

1523
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:15,080
your cats.
Never do anything.

1524
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,990
I don't pretend to be doing anything.
Okay.

1525
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:19,160
Let's,
let's be clear.

1526
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:23,390
You pretending that your dog might be 
able to see you and we'll talk to you.

1527
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:25,310
Look at Dr doolittle movie.
I'm not,

1528
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:30,370
I'm not.
I don't pretend I don't sit around and 

1529
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:30,370
go.
Can I read your mind?

1530
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:30,370
No.
I don't know why,

1531
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,450
because I read a lot of books on dogs 
and humans and not once does it ever say

1532
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,490
anywhere that they can read your fucking
mind.

1533
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:39,580
So I assume that they can't read your 
mind and then when I watched like 

1534
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,240
zookeeper that that's just bullshit.
All right.

1535
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,300
Okay.
That's.

1536
01:04:41,301 --> 01:04:43,360
No,
I don't sit around and go,

1537
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,450
fuck me,
Mr Dolphin.

1538
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,020
No,
I don't,

1539
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:50,021
I don't do that.
So you tell me if you had a dolphin in 

1540
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:50,021
an aquarium tank inside your bedroom and
everyday he looked at that.

1541
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:55,130
Oh,
it asks you where it would want to live 

1542
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,341
and I wouldn't let it go.
Like if it was a crippled often it 

1543
01:04:57,341 --> 01:04:59,460
couldn't move.
I just sat there and had to stare and 

1544
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,481
look at it and shoot it in the head and 
we'll make the next life will come back 

1545
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:02,240
as a tuna to they sell retarded dolphins
for pets.

1546
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:07,241
That'd be awesome.
Like you could keep it in an aquarium 

1547
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:07,241
because it doesn't want to move.
It just wants to sit there and drool.

1548
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:11,110
But it'd be so cool to be alive and it 
would still want to eat and like just 

1549
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:11,480
having a retarded dolphin in your 
bedroom.

1550
01:05:11,481 --> 01:05:16,190
That'd be perfect if you were into that,
but I suspect you get bored because he'd

1551
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:18,020
probably be really stupid like the 
middle of

1552
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,700
the night.
He'd be like a crying out for you.

1553
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,060
He'd be like,
Oh my God.

1554
01:05:23,061 --> 01:05:26,240
You know how bad dolphin street sound at
3:00

1555
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:29,150
in the morning when you're hung over,
but what if it says happy noises?

1556
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,470
No,
it's a relaxing,

1557
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:34,340
but you're just hoping for a different 
type of Down's syndrome animal.

1558
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,520
You're not hoping for like a normal 
down's syndrome animals or an animal 

1559
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:39,710
with a disease for you.
It's like,

1560
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:44,740
well,
it's a magical down central animal 

1561
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:44,740
that's happy all the time.

1562
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:44,740
Well,
if we can clone them,

1563
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,750
if they're 13 cloning now animal 
cloning,

1564
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,760
so maybe you can clone your dog.
It should be all right to close a 

1565
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:50,760
retarded dolphin that you keep an 
aquarium that doesn't squeak.

1566
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,520
You know what?
We're really lucky.

1567
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,820
We're really lucky that people can't get
other animals pregnant.

1568
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,200
Okay.
We're really lucky because if,

1569
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,800
if that was the case,
there would be people.

1570
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,690
Everything out there.
There would be people,

1571
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,010
giraffes,
you would go,

1572
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:06,110
how the fuck did this happen?
It would happen.

1573
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:11,390
Would they get driver's license?
If you could fuck up an animal and get 

1574
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:16,151
it pregnant for sure.
There will be human animal hybrid all 

1575
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:18,250
over the world of everything,
of gorillas you would it to go.

1576
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:22,120
How the fuck did this happen?
Some dude,

1577
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:25,090
fuck does zebra roped it?
Held it down.

1578
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:26,910
Shot.
Not only that when it was operating,

1579
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,010
shot a load into it cam and not just 
fucked it but came.

1580
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,450
Okay.
That's a big deal.

1581
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,130
I mean we were talking about before the 
show,

1582
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:35,770
like when you know you've been dating a 
girl for a long time.

1583
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:39,490
Like if you're bored with sex,
like if you're not sexually compatible,

1584
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,040
you can get in those situations where 
you,

1585
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,470
you don't even really want to have sex 
with them anymore.

1586
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:47,590
We were talking about like when you're 
pretending you're fucking somebody else,

1587
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,930
like why your belly close your eyes.
Like oh yeah.

1588
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,760
Thinking about some chick that used to 
be like,

1589
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:53,860
that's ridiculous.
You're getting actual real sex,

1590
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,760
but you're pretending to get sex from a 
different person because that's the only

1591
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:59,290
way you're going gonna get off.
Well this guy,

1592
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,750
fuck zebra bitch.
Okay.

1593
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,890
Z.
He didn't have to pretend you have to.

1594
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:07,210
You know it's a zebra.
There's shit all over its ass and that's

1595
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:10,840
right next to your deck because zebras 
don't wipe their ass ever.

1596
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:16,050
They just dump out these gigantic jungle
shits and then you got to hold that 

1597
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,920
motherfucker down and bone it and get it
pregnant,

1598
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:18,760
but they would exist.

1599
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,160
There would be dudes in Africa that were
half zebra.

1600
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:25,690
They would look just like the Navi and 
then fucking avatar movie.

1601
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:29,080
There would be giant Zebra people.
There's no doubt about it,

1602
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:34,081
man.
That would be exactly the right height 

1603
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:35,731
too.
It'd be like a nine foot tall sort of 

1604
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:35,731
human zebra hybrid.
They would.

1605
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:40,110
The whole planet would be half people 
have fish people fucking fish for sure.

1606
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,420
To to fuck fish.
I and a hundred percent.

1607
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:47,230
I know I have no doubt about it.
There would be dogs would be ridiculous.

1608
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,420
Okay.
Dogs would be like.

1609
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:52,270
It would be like that.
The movie district nine,

1610
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,370
when those aliens came down and you 
know,

1611
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:55,960
they had a fucking figure out what to do
with them.

1612
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,680
That would be the human dog population 
because it will be so many human dogs.

1613
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,360
There would be like,
don't fuck your dogs.

1614
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:06,361
They'd be like big billboards with a 
deck and a dog and a big red line 

1615
01:08:06,361 --> 01:08:09,631
through it.
Don't fuck your dogs because people 

1616
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:09,631
would fucked her dogs.
They would definitely fuck the dogs.

1617
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,950
People have fucked parrots.
I guarantee you,

1618
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,560
if a person can get a pair of pregnant,
there'll be people,

1619
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:16,100
parent hybrids,
and it will be

1620
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,100
flying around our cities all day 
snatching purses and throwing shit at 

1621
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:21,860
people shitting on you.
Yeah,

1622
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:26,861
for sure.
If people could make hybrids with 

1623
01:08:26,861 --> 01:08:29,351
parents,
those motherfuckers would be like 

1624
01:08:29,351 --> 01:08:29,630
prisoners flying in the sky,
dropping rocks on people's heads,

1625
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:34,690
killing the Mashiah.
I guarantee you there'd be a person 

1626
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:34,690
pigeon.
You would look at it and go,

1627
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:36,650
how the fuck did that even happen?
But there'll be a half person,

1628
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:38,970
half pigeon,
like a foot and a half tall,

1629
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:42,740
all fucking pissed off and fucked up.
Feet fucked up.

1630
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:46,340
Pigeon feet and shit.
If people could get everything pregnant,

1631
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:48,410
we would get everything pregnant.
There would be people,

1632
01:08:48,411 --> 01:08:49,970
trees.
They'd be people,

1633
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:54,971
melons and pumpkins there.
There'll be people like Lord of the 

1634
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:57,440
rings just describing Lord of the rings.
But what of your loads got duplicated?

1635
01:08:57,441 --> 01:09:02,441
Everything.
If it wasn't just human being and be 

1636
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:02,441
like Mac book pro,
come over here and sit on daddy's lap.

1637
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,960
Sperm just reproduced everything and 
saw,

1638
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,890
just shoot sperm on a water bottle.
It makes another waterfall right next to

1639
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:14,891
it,
like one of those pods and that movie 

1640
01:09:14,891 --> 01:09:14,891
invasion of the body snatchers is grown 
under the bed.

1641
01:09:14,891 --> 01:09:15,740
Trying to become what it's,
you know,

1642
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,800
I'd find a time machine.
I would suck my own dick and fuck my 

1643
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,230
mouth and get my own pregnant.
Now it would just spin in a circle,

1644
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:26,231
like a cart wheel going down the street 
and be two mirrors looking into each 

1645
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:26,231
other.
Forever.

1646
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:31,430
Never end.
It'd be two mirrors facing each other to

1647
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:36,431
oblivion of you.
Boeing yourself in a spinning circle 

1648
01:09:36,431 --> 01:09:39,311
like you're in one of those cartoon 
wheels going down the hill like one guy 

1649
01:09:39,311 --> 01:09:41,210
holding another guy's foot or a dog 
biting it's tail a dog.

1650
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:43,760
Biting it's tail is the perfect analogy 
is rolling down the hill.

1651
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:46,910
There will be you sucking your own Dick 
and fucking yourself in the ass.

1652
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,370
And a giant circle,
a spiral spiral.

1653
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:54,080
Fractal had a marine we could roll up.
What's his face goes on and billions and

1654
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,990
billions of light years.
That's like a huge swirling galaxy.

1655
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:01,430
Have a zillion trillion Brian sucking 
their own dick and calling themselves in

1656
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:05,210
the ass and a giant circle of impossible
reality.

1657
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,560
Imagine.
Hey,

1658
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:10,520
that's not any more impossible to 
believe than a galaxy itself.

1659
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,500
No,
there's no way a guy can be,

1660
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:16,070
suck his own dick and fucking himself in
the ass flying around a star,

1661
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,360
but shoes,
gigantic balls of gas and slash or water

1662
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:25,361
and slash or rock that kind of makes 
sense with molten centers shooting live 

1663
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:27,350
out of their tents.
Yeah.

1664
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:28,160
Okay.
That makes.

1665
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,830
Yeah,
that makes more sense than a dude flying

1666
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:32,970
around sucking his own dick of boning 
himself in the ass.

1667
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,280
No,
that makes just as much sense.

1668
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,020
It's just as ridiculous.

1669
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:41,170
A whole universe filled with a spiral of
Brian's a trillion light years long.

1670
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:47,150
All bone in them is less than half as 
spectacular as a real supernova.

1671
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:52,250
So I'm really impressed.
I'm not impressed by your performance.

1672
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,120
I'm going to totally do what your,
uh,

1673
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,810
your friend does with the stripper 
pants.

1674
01:10:56,811 --> 01:10:58,160
I'm ready.
Shave like down,

1675
01:10:58,161 --> 01:11:02,180
like my swim trunks down to have a 
really thin layer and then when it often

1676
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:05,570
comes up to me,
I'm just going to see again,

1677
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:07,430
you don't make sense.
What I said makes sense.

1678
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:09,110
What you're saying is crazy.
No,

1679
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:10,250
I go,
fuck a dolphin,

1680
01:11:10,251 --> 01:11:11,000
son.
Dude.

1681
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,650
I'm just going to put my body right.
They're not going to let you.

1682
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,010
They're

1683
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,450
going to see what you're doing.
They're gonna arrest you.

1684
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:20,480
Do you think the guy,
they're going to be a fucking website 

1685
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,570
dedicated just like they have sex 
criminal websites.

1686
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:24,720
They're going to have guys who were even
thinking about fucking dolphins.

1687
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:30,050
It's sad enough.
These poor dolphins are kept in these 

1688
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,751
cages.
They wished they were out in the ocean 

1689
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:32,751
chasing fish,
having a good time with each other.

1690
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:35,280
Know that we have to contain them in 
some shitty little spot and not even let

1691
01:11:35,281 --> 01:11:40,281
them kill their own fish,
which is part of the big thrill of life 

1692
01:11:40,281 --> 01:11:40,740
and some asshole thinks it's cute to try
to.

1693
01:11:40,741 --> 01:11:41,130
Fuck you.

1694
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:41,640
Yeah,
Joe,

1695
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,650
but I just found out their nipples are 
inside.

1696
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:46,650
They're assholes.
Did you know that's like the babies feed

1697
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:51,651
by putting their nose up that dolphins 
dick and it's like fucking shoots milk 

1698
01:11:51,651 --> 01:11:52,450
its ass.
And so like imagine this.

1699
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,520
Imagine having the best upgrade to a 
butthole ever having nipples and sign 

1700
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:58,520
now you're.

1701
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:58,760
No,
you're doing materials.

1702
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:04,110
You can't do that.
I saw you do it on stage where our 

1703
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,860
dolphins nipples in the ass hole.

1704
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,670
You're probably like,
what the fuck?

1705
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,220
I'm just enjoying the ride,
man.

1706
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,490
They're hidden side slits of the 
mother's underbelly.

1707
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:17,420
See you got to read Bible books.
There's no,

1708
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,040
no.
How does the dolphin feed?

1709
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,420
They had a baby dog.
These,

1710
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,240
um,
they don't feed other butthole dude.

1711
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,770
No they don't.

1712
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:33,610
I know that.
I did the [inaudible] experience at 

1713
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,910
Atlantis last year and they don't even 
want you to pet them around their blow 

1714
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:35,910
holes.
So you better be

1715
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:36,420
careful.
Really?

1716
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:37,420
Yeah.
They get upset.

1717
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,870
Oh,
I'm not gonna touch the blowhole why?

1718
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,560
Why,
why?

1719
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,460
To take the bullet point when you have 
the real thing.

1720
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,970
No.
Brian has slits in the underbelly of the

1721
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:51,980
mother and she releases these nipples.
She then the dolphins nurse.

1722
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:53,310
That way you don't know what you're 
talking about,

1723
01:12:53,311 --> 01:12:54,990
man.
That's you're talking crazy.

1724
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,730
Somebody said that to me.
Must have been.

1725
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:01,820
Yeah.
Well that person is probably Sam 

1726
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:02,370
Tripoli.
He probably sent you off the skids that.

1727
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,720
That's so dumb.
You can.

1728
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:06,300
All you gotta do is just Google that.
I saw you talking about that on stage.

1729
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:07,020
I was like,
no,

1730
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,350
they aren't.
I know they're not that.

1731
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:09,990
I would have known

1732
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,860
they actually brought me to like a 
science page or something like I have it

1733
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:14,560
on my twitter link.

1734
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:15,760
Okay.
It's not real son.

1735
01:13:15,761 --> 01:13:17,440
Look,
there's a picture of a dolphin,

1736
01:13:17,441 --> 01:13:19,570
a female dolphin nursing.
Look,

1737
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:20,950
look at that.
See?

1738
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:25,070
I think it can nurse two different ways.
Can't do it through the asshole.

1739
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,730
That's not healthy.
It's not a dolphin upgrade.

1740
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,530
You just trying to say that joke.
How dare you.

1741
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:34,530
Oh,
I wonder if this is true.

1742
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,860
No,
it's not true.

1743
01:13:35,861 --> 01:13:38,050
Brian.
Don't wonder Jesus Christ.

1744
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,960
Guys like you are walking here

1745
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,730
located in his anus.
The cast sticks.

1746
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:47,100
It's built into the whole of the baby 
nurses from its mother through.

1747
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,230
You're on the onion.com.

1748
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,550
Okay.
Stop it.

1749
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:51,360
No,
they don't.

1750
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,790
They can't.
You would know that it was on.

1751
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,480
What the fuck?
Facts dot commerce.

1752
01:13:55,810 --> 01:14:00,810
I think those things.
A lot of times people just make that 

1753
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:00,810
shit up.
I really don't think you can.

1754
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,280
Oh Shit.

1755
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,630
I just don't think that you would,
you.

1756
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:07,490
First of all,
that wouldn't be natural.

1757
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:12,090
It doesn't make any sense that you would
want to be feeding near fecal matter.

1758
01:14:12,091 --> 01:14:13,920
Why would nature ever set that up?
Yeah.

1759
01:14:13,921 --> 01:14:17,210
You're going to eat right near where 
your mom shits.

1760
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,900
Are you cool with that?
Otherwise you die,

1761
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,220
right?
No,

1762
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:21,960
no.
And everywhere it says they have nipples

1763
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:25,050
in these slits hidden inside the small 
underbelly.

1764
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,000
Uh,
under the,

1765
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:28,110
uh,
no question.

1766
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,090
Yeah.
Every website that I'm looking at.

1767
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:35,091
So it's the same thing.
They have these nipples that are hidden 

1768
01:14:35,091 --> 01:14:35,091
in a slit in the underbelly,

1769
01:14:35,091 --> 01:14:37,850
fake dolphin nursing facts going on the 
Internet.

1770
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,260
Everyone's fucking.
They want to find out how people are.

1771
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,800
They want to find out how dumb people 
are and whether or not people will 

1772
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,081
google things.
It's probably an experiment and you 

1773
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:51,911
probably just led to this disinformation
campaign because you've been talking 

1774
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:52,640
about it onstage for several weeks now

1775
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:57,680
without ever even once without ever 
saying the exact opposite,

1776
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:01,560
but I believe you because I'm also 
seeing more on what you're saying.

1777
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:01,920
Then

1778
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,900
the websites that are saying that you 
can,

1779
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,520
they,
they are in their ass like uber facts.

1780
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,340
Who's writing Uberflip?
Dolphin Reef Dot Com.

1781
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,070
Anybody can contribute to these things 
and sneak them in.

1782
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:19,310
There's a,
there's a lot of these little silly 

1783
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:21,010
twitter pages and websites and where 
they make things up on person.

1784
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,580
I've read a bunch of them like,
oh my God,

1785
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:26,220
what the fuck in your ass facts.
You know,

1786
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,200
there's a lot of those that are not 
really facts.

1787
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:31,080
They're just trying to get retweets and 
they'll say something crazy.

1788
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:34,080
They get retweets and then they'll like 
tweet out.

1789
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,090
We're giving away a free ipad.
You know what I mean?

1790
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:37,680
Like they get,
there's,

1791
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:42,790
there's a,
there's a bunch of people that have 

1792
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,361
businesses that are set up just around 
like getting people to their websites 

1793
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:46,020
and getting people to know.
So don't make shit up.

1794
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:52,160
Sorry,
I didn't think people would lie about 

1795
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,160
dolphins.
Seriously.

1796
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,800
You know,
I think people would lie about them,

1797
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:55,800
but you did think that you would like to
sneak up behind one and asked one if you

1798
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,360
could just touching,
rubbing it,

1799
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,130
rubbing around the outside type.
Shit.

1800
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:01,020
You know,
I just think it'd be feel good.

1801
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,750
So let's have you touched a dolphin.
I have not even touched the it.

1802
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,780
It's like raping a prisoner that you 
can't understand.

1803
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,230
This was like he's crying and you're 
like,

1804
01:16:07,231 --> 01:16:09,450
you liked it.
Meanwhile in his language he's screaming

1805
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:10,590
out,
please stop fucking me.

1806
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,450
That's what it'd be like if you had sex 
with adults.

1807
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,640
Like if I touched a dolphin,
does it feel like your cheek?

1808
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,560
It's like plastic.
It's like plastic,

1809
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:18,270
so it doesn't look hard.
Plus it feels like a dildo.

1810
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,380
Yeah.
No,

1811
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,450
I really felt that Dildo.
Wetsuit.

1812
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,910
Maybe your wetsuit.
You've never felt the deal.

1813
01:16:23,911 --> 01:16:25,680
Never ever lived.
I never lived.

1814
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:26,990
I'll try it later.
I guess.

1815
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:32,030
Clearly touched the tilt down.
Have you ever seen one over a chick's 

1816
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:32,610
house?
I'm actually only 12 years old.

1817
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:35,610
Oh fuck.
He's got that crazy disease.

1818
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:37,350
Yeah.
Dylan.

1819
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,760
Those nobody's impressed with the way 
they feel.

1820
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:39,660
I mean,
you know,

1821
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,210
I mean it gets kind of close to like 
what a Dick would feel like,

1822
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:45,690
but you'd know the difference if I put a
dick in your hand and then I put a Dildo

1823
01:16:45,691 --> 01:16:47,610
in your hand,
like which one is the real dick?

1824
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:54,090
You know,
you feel electricity right through 

1825
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:55,010
riddick.
Totally feel it.

1826
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:01,650
Have you ever sparked but your deck,
I wonder if it could cause your blendtec

1827
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:06,651
blender to catch fire.
I just throw it in there and find out 

1828
01:17:06,651 --> 01:17:08,570
all this show's gone off the in,

1829
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,560
into the wounds to de de,
de,

1830
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:13,490
de,
de Doo.

1831
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,340
I'm back to positive thinking,
man.

1832
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,350
Today to say,
les miserables,

1833
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:22,580
you gotta learn how to talk English so 
the people understand you.

1834
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:23,390
I don't even know what you said.

1835
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,270
I'm sorry.
I'm eating one of these on it.

1836
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:27,820
Buffalo bars don't talk at the same 
time.

1837
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:31,150
Fuck.
Did you see the Quentin Tarantino movie?

1838
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:32,840
No.
No,

1839
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,590
but uh,

1840
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:35,060
was it good?
Jamie said,

1841
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:36,080
it's fucking awesome.
Jamie says,

1842
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:37,790
awesome.
It looks amazing.

1843
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,040
I can't wait to see it.
Yeah,

1844
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,200
it looks pretty bad.
Attention.

1845
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:45,210
Quintin Tarantino is a bad motherfucker.
He makes the kind of movies that people 

1846
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:45,210
want to see,
like fun,

1847
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:48,911
crazy movies where nutty shit goes down.
Did you see the hot end up seeing the 

1848
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:48,911
hobbit?
Yes,

1849
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:51,320
I saw them.
Did you like it was at Dick's house.

1850
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,680
What time did you fall asleep?
And I grew up in our,

1851
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:56,580
in our,
in my wife nuts,

1852
01:17:56,581 --> 01:17:57,020
me.
She goes,

1853
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:57,860
you're not asleep.
I go,

1854
01:17:57,861 --> 01:17:59,430
nope,
I was totally asleep.

1855
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:04,750
You've got to get your points up.
I guess that's a new game that you get 

1856
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,571
your points and like how fast she can 
fall asleep in the hobbit and 18 

1857
01:18:07,571 --> 01:18:10,640
seconds.
I couldn't have to sleep about a half an

1858
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:11,660
hour.
And you know,

1859
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:13,340
the problem with all those movies is.

1860
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,320
I hate saying this because I even make 
fun of people say that.

1861
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:21,321
First of all,
I read the books and I read them when I 

1862
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:21,321
was a little kid and they were like a 
part of me growing up,

1863
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:23,580
you know,
some watching it and I know that certain

1864
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:26,460
shit has to happen.
So you already like it.

1865
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:31,461
That takes away from a lot of the drama 
of the movie because you know all these 

1866
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:31,461
things going to happen.
It's like,

1867
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:35,331
okay,
well how are they going to happen as 

1868
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:35,331
opposed to,
you know,

1869
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:38,870
a great film that's entirely original.
So this movie is an adaptation of the 

1870
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,310
novel that you've already read.
So there's that and then there's that.

1871
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:46,320
There's so much to tell that it takes a 
long ass time to tell it all and it's 

1872
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,510
just not as enjoyable when you're 
watching it in the film forum.

1873
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:53,690
Then if you're watching it in a movie.
So there's all this shit that happened 

1874
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:53,850
that it's just like,
yeah,

1875
01:18:53,851 --> 01:18:56,550
it looks really cool,
but it's just some shit happening.

1876
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:59,220
Like the scene of they're fighting the 
ogres and I'm like,

1877
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:01,230
spoiler,
spoiler alert.

1878
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:03,870
They fight Ogres,
but after awhile I'm like,

1879
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:04,560
oh,
I get it.

1880
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:06,870
They're going to be fine and let's just 
watch them.

1881
01:19:06,871 --> 01:19:11,871
Cartoon initially have this fight that 
has no drama attached to it at all and 

1882
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,140
it there was,
there was a lot of that,

1883
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:16,260
but the special effects are fucking 
stunning.

1884
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,140
What they can do now is fucking 
stunning.

1885
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,400
What frame rate did you see that?
Do you see the creepy one?

1886
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:22,210
I thought,
yeah,

1887
01:19:22,211 --> 01:19:27,211
the high frame rate.
Three d was and people that were 

1888
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:27,211
complaining about that,
go,

1889
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:30,670
fuck yourself.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1890
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,750
Are you really complaining?
Like that fake version of the TV.

1891
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,980
They were like,
this is gonna ruin films forever.

1892
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:37,850
It gives the entire film with creepy.
To me,

1893
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,800
it's a fantasy movie.
You fuck stick suspension of disbelief.

1894
01:19:41,801 --> 01:19:42,550
Isn't that the point?
Well,

1895
01:19:42,551 --> 01:19:47,551
not only that,
this is the most suspension of 

1896
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:47,551
disbelief.
He movie of all time.

1897
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:49,570
It's a whole fucking you're following to
do with giant,

1898
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:52,120
furry feet and a wizard.
Okay.

1899
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:57,180
Jesus Christ.
Are you really saying it doesn't look 

1900
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:57,180
real?
You asshole.

1901
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:59,080
It's not supposed to look real stupid.
Fuck face.

1902
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:04,410
It's supposed to be fun and it's way 
more fun when it's in that high frame 

1903
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:04,900
rate.
Three d verse.

1904
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,460
It's bad ass,
man.

1905
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:08,040
When I was at my friend's

1906
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,940
house for Christmas,
uh,

1907
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,740
her brother was playing call of duty in 
three D and I put it on the glasses.

1908
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:14,080
I was like,

1909
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:16,310
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1910
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,050
Those three d tvs,
those are nuts.

1911
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:20,480
We had a three d laptop that alienware 
gave us,

1912
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,340
but we never played a game and it on it

1913
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:27,620
play play portal to how was it sweet.
But I mean I also have three d TVs I've 

1914
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,130
been playing call of duty and three days
ago who gives a shit

1915
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:31,690
man?
Um,

1916
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,570
the,
the,

1917
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:35,070
the technology for those things has 
gotten really,

1918
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,130
really powerful.
I,

1919
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,330
I saw a three d television recently at 
one of those.

1920
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:40,810
What are those?
Uh,

1921
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:45,600
those high end fucking stores.
That's a audio visual store.

1922
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,250
Yeah.
I forget what it was,

1923
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:51,060
but we were on the road and we walked 
into one of these retail stores and they

1924
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:56,061
had this crazy fucking setup where it's 
really thin glass and that was 

1925
01:20:57,421 --> 01:20:58,920
essentially the entire TV.
It was,

1926
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,830
it was really weird.
And you put these glasses on it.

1927
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:03,390
What did we watch?
Monster's inc.

1928
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:04,340
Is that what it was?
Yeah.

1929
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:06,490
Monsters Inc and three d.
And it's just like,

1930
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:13,250
it's such an overwhelming experience,
like there's so much more visual input 

1931
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:16,230
coming your way and like this added 
dimension of it,

1932
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,990
if they could just get it down like 
that,

1933
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:21,870
like the perfect way.
But like really bad at like avatar.

1934
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:25,410
Avatar I think was way better because of
the three days.

1935
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,090
Yeah.
Avatar just came out on three day.

1936
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,250
By the way,
if you have a three d tv,

1937
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:30,020
it just finally came out so everyone can
buy.

1938
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,320
It used to be where you only could buy 
it if he bought this $150.

1939
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,480
See I feel like if you wear glasses in 
your house,

1940
01:21:35,481 --> 01:21:36,380
you might be an asshole.

1941
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,850
Oh,
did I love it man.

1942
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,960
I got these new ones off amazon.
They're just generic for like 20 bucks.

1943
01:21:40,961 --> 01:21:43,330
They just charge it by usb.
So you always have them charged.

1944
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:44,860
You just put on.
It's like putting on sunglasses.

1945
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:46,870
But while you're laying in bed,
do you think one day we'll look

1946
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:51,900
back in the day when we'll laugh about 
the days when they used to have to wear 

1947
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,860
glasses to greedy fucks,
but it'll be like,

1948
01:21:53,861 --> 01:21:58,861
it's ancient data technology.
I mean essentially we're trying to 

1949
01:21:58,861 --> 01:22:01,471
distort an image.
If you take your glasses off and you 

1950
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:01,471
watched the hobbit,
it's craziness.

1951
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:02,800
It's like it's very rarely see what the 
fuck's happening.

1952
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:04,720
It's gross,
but then he put the glasses on.

1953
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,660
So somehow or another they need this 
distortion and the pastor.

1954
01:22:07,661 --> 01:22:12,661
Just a simple lens,
just a little simple lens that's really 

1955
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:12,670
close to your eyes in order to make it 
happen.

1956
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,160
I don't accept that.
I said nonsense,

1957
01:22:15,161 --> 01:22:18,910
so that I think until now,
not much these crazy fucks in the hadron

1958
01:22:18,911 --> 01:22:21,420
collider people,
they're doing some things,

1959
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:23,530
but they're going to be able to figure 
out three d,

1960
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:26,470
three d is going to be.
I think eventually it's going to be.

1961
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,450
Everyone's going to have instead of a 
television,

1962
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:29,710
you just gonna have like one of those 
help me,

1963
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,850
obi one.
You're my only hope.

1964
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,050
One of those little things that she 
stuck on,

1965
01:22:32,051 --> 01:22:37,051
r two,
d two and they're going to sit that 

1966
01:22:37,051 --> 01:22:38,671
bitch down and step back and it's going 
to make a show for you right in front 

1967
01:22:38,671 --> 01:22:38,671
of.

1968
01:22:38,671 --> 01:22:41,560
Yeah,
and it's everyone's gonna be doing it 

1969
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,301
everywhere too.
You're going to be like in the parking 

1970
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,071
lot,
there's going to be like average people 

1971
01:22:45,071 --> 01:22:46,271
are gonna throw advertisements in front 
of you and your fucking thing out of 

1972
01:22:46,271 --> 01:22:46,271
here.
You know,

1973
01:22:46,271 --> 01:22:46,310
I don't want to see this hologram thing.

1974
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:51,440
Yeah.
You're going to be walking down the 

1975
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:51,440
street and you're going to watch,
like see through.

1976
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:51,450
People have sword fights right in front 
of you.

1977
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,480
It can be.
Is that a real person to post?

1978
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:54,780
Is that a hologram?
Hologram,

1979
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:56,780
right.
It's going to be totallY pokemon shit.

1980
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,550
Big fucking dude can add each other with
swords.

1981
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:02,210
Right in the Middle of a fucking 
intersection.

1982
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:06,130
People driving right through them 
putting me like ufc fights

1983
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:06,740
on the,
on the,

1984
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,650
on the road.
Just tryIng.

1985
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:09,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

1986
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,520
Right.
Where you people trying to walk through 

1987
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,950
head kicking each other,
like escort guys like in vegas where 

1988
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,221
they're like flipping the tickets now 
they're just gonna be like interrupting 

1989
01:23:20,221 --> 01:23:20,830
your fights with like the girls like 
fucking giving blow jobs to other guys.

1990
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,490
Yeah.
Trainees.

1991
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,570
Yeah.
It's going to be all over the street.

1992
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,100
You're going to watch tranny sex coming 
out of the ground.

1993
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,500
People going to outlaw that and then 
they go,

1994
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:31,330
this is.
I'm trying to walk on my kid to school.

1995
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,270
Fucking looking at trainees banging each
other.

1996
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:34,470
Right?
They're alive

1997
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:39,650
with the censorship be there'll be like 
a smoke that you throw on the ground 

1998
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:39,680
that like blocks the hologram or 
something makes

1999
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,680
me wonder like is there like the 
internet is the only place that we've 

2000
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,470
ever had in our whole life where there's
no censorship.

2001
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:48,290
The internet is just,
it's the wild west and it's free.

2002
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,650
How much you like to spend on the 
internet?

2003
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,810
A lot.
A lot.

2004
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:56,870
Most people are on the internet for at 
least an hour a day.

2005
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:57,860
You know?
More.

2006
01:23:57,861 --> 01:24:02,861
So if you get a chance to be in front of
a computer at work and you don't have a 

2007
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:06,011
lot of shit to do,
a lot of people are online all the 

2008
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:08,471
fucking time.
How much different is that than real 

2009
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:11,291
life?
And imagine if real life had no 

2010
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:12,110
censorship at all,
either in real life,

2011
01:24:12,111 --> 01:24:17,111
you could buy all the drugs you want to 
get a gun whenever you want it to get a 

2012
01:24:17,111 --> 01:24:17,111
car,
wherever you.

2013
01:24:17,111 --> 01:24:20,480
Even when you do everything that you 
could do online you could do in real 

2014
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,610
life with no,
no restrictions whatsoever.

2015
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,340
How many districts,
what you wonder,

2016
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:30,341
how much regulation do we actually need 
and how much could just exist under 

2017
01:24:30,341 --> 01:24:31,230
common sense.
I mean would,

2018
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:36,250
could you allow someone to really 
stockpile a fucking huge ammo dump and 

2019
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:36,890
you know,
have a,

2020
01:24:36,891 --> 01:24:39,530
a,
an armory of vehicles and tanks and shit

2021
01:24:39,531 --> 01:24:40,760
and like,
oh man,

2022
01:24:40,761 --> 01:24:42,150
you gotta stop doing that.
Or you know what?

2023
01:24:42,151 --> 01:24:43,820
You have to knock on their door and go,
what are you,

2024
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:45,400
what are you doing over here?
Why do you have an,

2025
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,010
a,
b,

2026
01:24:46,011 --> 01:24:47,900
one bomber?
The fuck's going on.

2027
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,180
You got to stealth fighter plane in your
backyard,

2028
01:24:50,181 --> 01:24:51,290
bitch.
What are you planning on doing?

2029
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:53,240
Man?
I live right down the street.

2030
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:54,410
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.

2031
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,270
Yeah.
Our kids go to school together I think.

2032
01:24:56,271 --> 01:24:56,660
Yeah.
Okay,

2033
01:24:56,661 --> 01:24:58,670
cool.
You are you an army?

2034
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,800
What's what's happening here?
Should you know?

2035
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:03,050
Should there be any restrictions 
whatsoever?

2036
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:08,350
And if there weren't,
if you look at the way people have sort 

2037
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:08,390
of learned how to express themselves on 
the internet.

2038
01:25:08,391 --> 01:25:13,391
I think the internet went through a real
bad time and now I think it's slowly 

2039
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:16,970
starting to like level out where people 
are less and less tolerant of assholes.

2040
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,550
Less and less tolerant of trolls.
Less and less.

2041
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,890
That dude that got busted,
that was like on reddit,

2042
01:25:21,891 --> 01:25:26,891
you know about that story with a guy 
who's doing a lot of creepy shit online 

2043
01:25:26,891 --> 01:25:31,410
like because that's what got them off 
like posts and fucked up pictures and 

2044
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:35,230
saying fucked up things about things and
these people found out who he was in 

2045
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:39,761
real life and they contacted his 
employer and he got fired for operating 

2046
01:25:39,951 --> 01:25:44,060
under a pseudonym online under a 
completely different name than his own.

2047
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:45,590
Not representing their company in any 
way,

2048
01:25:45,591 --> 01:25:47,960
shape or form,
but because they established that it was

2049
01:25:47,961 --> 01:25:50,780
him,
they went after him and decided that his

2050
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:54,530
actions and the way he was behaving 
outside during his own free time,

2051
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:58,190
they could fire him for that regardless 
of how well he performed at work,

2052
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:02,750
which is really weird,
but it also sends a message that sends a

2053
01:26:02,751 --> 01:26:03,110
message.

2054
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,220
Well,
no,

2055
01:26:04,221 --> 01:26:09,221
we're more concerned with humanity than 
we are with this idea that you have 

2056
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:13,280
these irrefutable rights.
Like yes,

2057
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:18,281
you have irrefutable rights,
but if you're posting pictures of dead 

2058
01:26:18,281 --> 01:26:18,281
kids online,
you might.

2059
01:26:18,281 --> 01:26:22,130
You might be a piece of shit and I might
not want you to have anything to do with

2060
01:26:22,131 --> 01:26:27,110
my life and just because we worked 
together like I should be able to remove

2061
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:28,670
that.
I should be able to stop that.

2062
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:33,850
So in that sense I think,
I think it's sort of the anonymity is 

2063
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:35,480
slowly slipping away.
Yeah.

2064
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,660
But for people that have never been 
anonymous like me or brian,

2065
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:39,620
I think it's,
it's,

2066
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:41,660
it's,
you're better off that way.

2067
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:46,870
You're better off everybody.
It would be better off for everybody if 

2068
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:50,590
we all figured out how to treat each 
other a lot better online and be chill 

2069
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:55,340
and I think people because there was no 
repercussions for a long time,

2070
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,400
they just,
they had an experience that they 

2071
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:00,400
shouldn't have had.

2072
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,120
They had the ability to affect someone 
with nothing coming back your way is the

2073
01:27:03,121 --> 01:27:08,121
no,
no social repercussions and that's like 

2074
01:27:08,121 --> 01:27:08,121
not normal for humans.
You can't do that in real life.

2075
01:27:08,121 --> 01:27:09,740
Right?
Why should you be able to do it online?

2076
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:14,800
Well,
we're not a setup for it and I think 

2077
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,931
this is a total.
It's such a totally new experience that 

2078
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:20,111
I think human beings are culture and I 
think all cultures in general went into 

2079
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:25,631
this completely ignorant to the 
repercussions of it to completely 

2080
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:30,641
ignorant to how it was going to operate 
and what the effects of human beings and

2081
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:36,011
human instincts are going to be when 
confronted with this completely non 

2082
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:39,441
human scenario.
The ability to communicate with people 

2083
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:41,981
who don't know who you are and not just 
communicate like you yell something out 

2084
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:45,620
from that from a hill,
but write detailed shit about them.

2085
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:50,800
You know,
and send some mean angry letter to them 

2086
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,430
and that you could do that and this 
burst and had not have anything come 

2087
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:54,430
back to you.
And because of that,

2088
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:56,720
because people have this unique ability 
to reach people like that,

2089
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,930
it presented this thing that hadn't been
resolved yet in,

2090
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:03,050
in the human body and in the human 
culture in like,

2091
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:08,200
you know,
are our ways of resolving conflicts for 

2092
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:08,480
one on one.
I've been pretty clearly established.

2093
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,830
You know,
the way people shouldn't,

2094
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:11,570
shouldn't treat each other.
It's in the bible,

2095
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,500
you know,
but you know,

2096
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:14,180
love your brother and all that shit.
It's like,

2097
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:16,340
it's all like the idea is,
look,

2098
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:21,370
this is the best way to operate a world.
We have to figure out how to resolve 

2099
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:21,370
these conflicts.
When they're done,

2100
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:21,620
they appear.
Well,

2101
01:28:21,621 --> 01:28:23,180
these conflicts had never appeared 
before.

2102
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:25,370
They literally didn't exist in our 
generation.

2103
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,620
And that's something that is escaping a 
lot of people.

2104
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:32,800
A lot of people are not.
They haven't really truly wrapped their 

2105
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,621
heads on the insanity that is the 
internet and what it's done to human 

2106
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:36,710
culture.
But I think we've,

2107
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:41,860
we've sort of wobbled it and I've got a 
way better handle on it now and I think 

2108
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,790
that you see way less and less douchey 
shit way westland,

2109
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:45,740
less people that will just want to be 
assholes.

2110
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:49,040
It's less like,
I think if you could see like statistics

2111
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:51,470
on internet trolling and douchebags on 
twitter and stuff like that.

2112
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:53,480
I think it's slowly tapered off.
I really do.

2113
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:58,690
I don't think it's just for me,
I think it's always going to be a good 

2114
01:28:58,690 --> 01:28:59,030
supply always.
You know,

2115
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,440
just like there's always going to be 
monkeys throw shit at other.

2116
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,790
There's always.

2117
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:08,530
But I think it's better.
I've even had people online on poker 

2118
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:10,760
like talk crap to me and say how they're
gonna mess me up in vegas and then I see

2119
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:11,780
him at the table and they're like,
hey,

2120
01:29:11,781 --> 01:29:13,970
I'm so and so,
like they're trying to be all nice to me

2121
01:29:13,971 --> 01:29:15,830
and I'm just like,
wait a second,

2122
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:16,950
you just,
you know,

2123
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,030
you were talking to shit to me online 
now you're trying to be my friend.

2124
01:29:20,031 --> 01:29:21,740
What's going on?
You confront them.

2125
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:23,300
I don't,
but I should.

2126
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,130
poker players are like,
um,

2127
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:28,100
it's a weird way to make a living man 
lot.

2128
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:33,340
I've met a lot of poker players and 
first of all they're all like really 

2129
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:34,820
intense dudes.
Everyone is like an intense and like,

2130
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:38,060
like they're all,
they're all very focused,

2131
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:43,120
you know,
like when you're having conversations 

2132
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,651
with them and there's no dumb 
professional poker players because it 

2133
01:29:44,651 --> 01:29:44,651
doesn't seem like he can really pull 
that off.

2134
01:29:44,651 --> 01:29:49,270
Are there that I don't know aBout well,
dumb how colleges like a showing or 

2135
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:51,320
intelligence in general,

2136
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:54,440
there's a big difference in my opinion,
between intelligence and education.

2137
01:29:54,441 --> 01:29:57,170
I've met a lot of people that are really
educated but stupid as fuck.

2138
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,300
He just repeats shit and you're like,
wait a minute,

2139
01:29:59,301 --> 01:30:00,740
you're not getting the connection to.
Right.

2140
01:30:00,741 --> 01:30:02,480
That doesn't fucking work.
And they,

2141
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,040
they,
there's no thinking on their own.

2142
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:09,041
It's repeating shit.
But then there's a lot of people that 

2143
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:09,380
have like bArely a high school diploma 
and they're sharp as fuck.

2144
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:09,900
Well,
you know,

2145
01:30:09,901 --> 01:30:14,901
it's interesting you just said that 
there was a kid online that didn't 

2146
01:30:14,901 --> 01:30:17,301
graduate high school yet.
He made millions of dollars playing 

2147
01:30:17,301 --> 01:30:19,551
poker.
Quinn tarantino didn't graduate high 

2148
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:19,551
school.
Yeah,

2149
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:19,551
mostly we were just talking about the 
django.

2150
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:20,250
There you go.
Drop days.

2151
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,320
Your god.
A lot of people will not.

2152
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,510
I mean there's a lot of success people 
that I know even just didn't finish.

2153
01:30:25,511 --> 01:30:25,960
I mean I

2154
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:28,530
out of college with one semester to go,
oh,

2155
01:30:28,531 --> 01:30:33,531
I didn't finish college.
I did three years at umass boston and 

2156
01:30:33,531 --> 01:30:36,910
maybe the only reason I did it was 
because I didn't want people thinking I 

2157
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:37,260
was a loser.
I didn't even come close to grAduating.

2158
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,290
I had a lot of shit that I like.
If I wanted to.

2159
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,480
Like first of all it's taken like 
elective courses.

2160
01:30:42,481 --> 01:30:45,660
I was taking whatever courses I wanted 
to because it was on like a,

2161
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:51,080
they have a thing,
like they had like different programs 

2162
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:51,080
for people that had jobs,
you know,

2163
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,210
I forget what they call adult education 
or secondary education wherever.

2164
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:58,220
Yeah.
Because I took a year off and then I 

2165
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:58,220
started doing this and I was barely 
paying attention.

2166
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:58,830
That was barely,
you know,

2167
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:01,650
I've learned way more through 
documentaries than I did for those three

2168
01:31:01,651 --> 01:31:06,651
years of showing up at this building.
To wonder what the fuck I'm doing with 

2169
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:06,651
my life.

2170
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:06,940
I was just talking about this the other 
day.

2171
01:31:06,941 --> 01:31:08,200
I was like,
I was like,

2172
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,390
our college is necessary anymore.
I mean,

2173
01:31:10,391 --> 01:31:15,391
you could take your iphone and figure 
out everything you need to figure out 

2174
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:15,391
about,
you know,

2175
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:15,391
french or spanish or anything you want 
to learn.

2176
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:16,660
You can do it online.
What's

2177
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:21,660
dope about college is the college gives 
you an opportunity to be excited by new 

2178
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,860
and different people and new points of 
view.

2179
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,290
And I missed that.
I missed that.

2180
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:28,010
That aspect of uh,
of college.

2181
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:28,990
The social aspect.
Yeah.

2182
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,520
I couldn't go Anywhere.
I was,

2183
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:31,750
I was.
Well I could,

2184
01:31:31,751 --> 01:31:35,350
but when I had graduated high school,
so my competitive taekwondo dance,

2185
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:40,380
so from 18 through 21,
it was like my most competitive days 

2186
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:44,400
when I was completely dedicated to it.
And the idea of me going somewhere else 

2187
01:31:44,411 --> 01:31:46,230
to go to school was like,
there's no way I couldn't.

2188
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:48,570
I had a really good instructor and a 
really good team.

2189
01:31:48,571 --> 01:31:49,540
I was like,
I'm not going anywhere.

2190
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:54,541
I'm not,
I'm not going to move somewhere and go 

2191
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:55,801
to school for what I mean,
I don't even know what the fuck I want 

2192
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:55,801
to do.
I had no aspirations whatsoever,

2193
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:58,150
but I got so tired everybody telling me,
you know,

2194
01:31:58,151 --> 01:31:58,930
you're,
what are you doing?

2195
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,110
Uh,
you know,

2196
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,590
for awhile I would say I was training 
for the olympics because I was trying to

2197
01:32:02,591 --> 01:32:05,220
make the us olympic taekwondo team.
And then,

2198
01:32:05,221 --> 01:32:06,940
uh,
I gave up on saying that,

2199
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:11,410
but when I started kickboxing I started 
getting beat up and I was like,

2200
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,330
oh man,
I'm talking window.

2201
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,140
Have some fucking holes in it,
man.

2202
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:18,310
So then that stopped wanting to do that.
But the idea that,

2203
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:23,350
um,
I was just trying to find some other 

2204
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,350
path in life and figure out what I 
wanted to do,

2205
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:28,231
like is terrifying to say to someone 
because all I heard out of my own mouth 

2206
01:32:28,231 --> 01:32:28,231
was,
well,

2207
01:32:28,231 --> 01:32:29,500
I'm a fucking loser and I'm always going
to be a loser.

2208
01:32:29,501 --> 01:32:34,501
I'm never going to figure it out.
I'm never going to be able to take care 

2209
01:32:34,501 --> 01:32:34,501
of myself.
That's all I thought of when I said it.

2210
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,970
But today,
shit man,

2211
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:42,150
you could learn it least as much online 
as you could in a school most likely 

2212
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:47,170
more because you're going to have way 
more access to information than just the

2213
01:32:47,171 --> 01:32:49,480
few books this one guy subscribes to 
you.

2214
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:52,720
It's Basically just someone reading out 
of a book to you is what it is,

2215
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,760
but not only that,
you can do it all day,

2216
01:32:54,761 --> 01:32:56,290
every day,
wherever you are.

2217
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:58,710
The crazy thing about online,
especially if you got a big phone,

2218
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,130
one of those tablets,
phones or something like that.

2219
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:03,730
Yeah,
you could fucking read like websites and

2220
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:06,550
books.
You could do it all day long.

2221
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:07,480
You can.
You have,

2222
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:09,700
as long as you have a signal that can 
come to you,

2223
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:14,880
you have access to like pretty much 
every question that's ever been asked 

2224
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,690
the if not the answer,
a slew of different competing answers 

2225
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:23,130
that you might not even get.
Especially if you go to like brigham 

2226
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:23,130
young university and get one opinion,
you're up with the mormon.

2227
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:28,320
I'm saying you got to be careful.
That's got to be fucking the most 

2228
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,880
devastating thing for like religions.
The access to information.

2229
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:33,460
The more people are finding out like,
well I remember when I was a catholic,

2230
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:38,540
right?
And we had friends that were jewish 

2231
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:38,540
because um,
you know,

2232
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:40,210
you live in New York.
When I was a little kid it was living in

2233
01:33:40,211 --> 01:33:41,060
New Jersey,
like the,

2234
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:46,090
that area,
the east coast is filled with jewish 

2235
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:46,090
people,
but I didn't understand what the jew,

2236
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:46,720
what a job.
I didn't even understand what it meant.

2237
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,280
I would just hear someone say,
oh,

2238
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:49,270
is he jewish?
Yeah,

2239
01:33:49,271 --> 01:33:52,790
he's mr feinstein and his wife of blah 
blah blah blah.

2240
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:58,530
I didn't know what that meant.
And then one day when I was in catholic 

2241
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:01,261
school,
somebody they were talking about like 

2242
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:04,170
different religions and judaism got 
brought up and someone said the,

2243
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:07,430
like the preset something about the,
uh,

2244
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,970
the jewish religion.
I was like,

2245
01:34:09,971 --> 01:34:13,180
the jewish went to,
that's judaism and get another.

2246
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:13,690
What is that?

2247
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,370
It's,
we're judeo christian.

2248
01:34:15,371 --> 01:34:16,090
And I was like,
whoa,

2249
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:16,540
whoa,
whoa,

2250
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:17,290
what?
Wait a minute,

2251
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,440
wait a minute.
It's more than one version of the story,

2252
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:22,270
like,
are you fucking shitting me?

2253
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:27,420
Just that,
just them telling me about competing 

2254
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,080
versions of the story.
If I could have gotten online when I was

2255
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:34,081
six and googled his religion bullshit,
just gone through every fucking piece of

2256
01:34:36,251 --> 01:34:37,330
information,
which by the way,

2257
01:34:37,331 --> 01:34:39,640
when you're six,
you could fucking read kinda,

2258
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:44,760
you know,
you could probably actually do this and 

2259
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:44,760
you could figure out if you could ask 
like,

2260
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,670
dad,
what does collaborate mean?

2261
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:50,910
You know,
you like there's a few of those you'd 

2262
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:52,381
have to throw out there,
but basically you could get a pretty 

2263
01:34:52,381 --> 01:34:54,781
good idea of why you shouldn't pay 
attention to these crazy fox because 

2264
01:34:54,781 --> 01:34:57,631
every one of their story they swear by 
and every one of the stories is 

2265
01:34:57,631 --> 01:34:57,631
different than everybody else's fucking 
store.

2266
01:34:57,631 --> 01:34:58,010
Someone's got to be wrong.

2267
01:34:58,090 --> 01:34:59,120
You know,
It's funny,

2268
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:04,270
my friend stephanie,
she posted on her facebook the other 

2269
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:07,031
day,
a picture of two people with reading 

2270
01:35:07,031 --> 01:35:07,670
bibles,
different beliefs.

2271
01:35:07,671 --> 01:35:08,720
And it said,
oh,

2272
01:35:08,721 --> 01:35:11,850
yours is fulfilled with bs too.
And uh,

2273
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,960
she got someone from Saudi Arabia that 
just went nuts on her for just defendant

2274
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:18,800
is beliefs blindly?

2275
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:22,170
No,
I used to do a whole

2276
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,510
bit about how,
um,

2277
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:28,190
the israelis and palestinians or the 
arabs and the israelis are constantly at

2278
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:30,440
war.
But they look so similar to each other,

2279
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,800
you know,
and that was because they were sneaking 

2280
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,661
over and getting forbidden sex and they 
would have an angry like angry opposing 

2281
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:39,410
religion,
sex.

2282
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:40,850
Like you believe the crazy shit

2283
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:46,580
crazy shit.
Did you see that episode of curb your 

2284
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:46,580
enthusiasm?
Where Larry David,

2285
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:50,090
it takes back.
I'm a palestinian lady

2286
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:53,940
from a chicken joint that he's not.
Well,

2287
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,940
he's swimming.
He's single now.

2288
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:56,720
Larry.
David?

2289
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:58,480
Yeah.
The enthusiasm in the show.

2290
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,220
In the show.
Yeah.

2291
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:04,270
Yeah.
Divorced friends kind of friends are 

2292
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:07,560
trying to get back to you.
So now he gets new checks.

2293
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:11,090
He's sitting there and stirred.
Can I swear on this?

2294
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:12,890
Oh fuck you.
Are you serious?

2295
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:18,340
She's saying she's saying she's saying 
fuck me jus when she's,

2296
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,980
when she's sitting on top of it.
So yeah.

2297
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:22,670
Well that's sort of

2298
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,390
old.
A bit like a who used to do that.

2299
01:36:25,391 --> 01:36:30,391
There's a black guy that used to do 
about how like dating a white girl and 

2300
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,450
making her say fuck me with your big 
nigger cock.

2301
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,520
Yeah.
And then sam aaa says that every other 

2302
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:38,520
podcasts,
if sam do that too,

2303
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,750
like every podcast,
what does he like to say that he likes 

2304
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:42,750
to say that word

2305
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,050
being edgy.
Um,

2306
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:44,380
yeah.
That,

2307
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:49,410
that idea of the opposing getting it off
spit that's existed for a long time and 

2308
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:55,060
attention for fruits.
The black girl in a white neighborhood.

2309
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,130
Oh yeah.
We're,

2310
01:36:59,131 --> 01:37:01,300
we're Silly bitches highway when It 
comes to forbidden fruit.

2311
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:04,450
Know we want,
we can have what do you do?

2312
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:09,451
Anything to tell the fighters how to 
concentrate on their diet when like 

2313
01:37:09,451 --> 01:37:10,000
trying to,
like I said,

2314
01:37:10,001 --> 01:37:12,670
just let it in.
But as far as like not thinking negative

2315
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:15,010
things because a lot of times like 
that's all they think about.

2316
01:37:15,011 --> 01:37:15,640
It's like,
fuck,

2317
01:37:15,641 --> 01:37:16,630
I wish I could eat.
Fuck,

2318
01:37:16,631 --> 01:37:18,100
I wish I could eat.
No,

2319
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:20,120
I haven't actually dealt with that yet.
No,

2320
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:22,290
it's never come up.
I think that would be something like,

2321
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:24,310
I don't know,
mike dolce is uh,

2322
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,840
one of the best guys at,
uh,

2323
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:28,900
getting guys to make weight.
And he's also like,

2324
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:34,170
he's got a good mindset for like 
coaching good mindset for like not 

2325
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:34,170
bullshitting with you.

2326
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:36,180
And straighten up and he gets them to 
the sled.

2327
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,940
Compli,
we're eating healthy foods.

2328
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:40,150
You're not killing yourself.
If your body's fine.

2329
01:37:40,151 --> 01:37:40,720
And I'm like,
yeah,

2330
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:42,480
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

2331
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:45,220
You know he can fucking tick tock tick 
tock.

2332
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:48,340
But if you go on one of those spirals,
it's like any other spiral.

2333
01:37:48,341 --> 01:37:49,570
If you get it onto that.
Fuck,

2334
01:37:49,571 --> 01:37:51,010
I wish I could eat fire up spiral.
Fuck.

2335
01:37:51,011 --> 01:37:52,870
I wish I could do this.
I wish you could have a cigarette.

2336
01:37:52,871 --> 01:37:53,920
Fuck,
I wish I could have a cigarette.

2337
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,140
And the moment you do that,
you're yourself down that path.

2338
01:37:56,290 --> 01:38:01,290
I seen people like this motherfucker.
He started smoking cigarettes again 

2339
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,140
because there's cat hurt its foot.
Stop.

2340
01:38:02,141 --> 01:38:03,940
And think about that.
He was looking for an excuse.

2341
01:38:03,941 --> 01:38:07,420
so much fucking cats for what I do,
man.

2342
01:38:07,421 --> 01:38:09,910
Fucking cats live.
This is crazy.

2343
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:15,450
It wasn't because Of that,
that cat in the bathroom with a litter 

2344
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:17,530
box come back in a couple of days.
it was a ton of shit.

2345
01:38:17,531 --> 01:38:20,170
And that was the thIng that snapped the 
big bowl of food.

2346
01:38:20,171 --> 01:38:22,570
A fresh litter box locker in the 
kitchen.

2347
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:24,850
Go to palm springs for the weekend.
Go somewhere

2348
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,350
with that tap,
figure this shit out.

2349
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,760
Let it do what it would do if went to 
the emergency room out there in the 

2350
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:31,760
wild.
Oh,

2351
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,150
it doesn't exist.
Oh,

2352
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,480
well I guess the cats,
you're not supposed to fix them.

2353
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:38,710
Does your for no reason to middle night.
Like a foreign morning to start going.

2354
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,200
Well what the fuck is that?
Shit.

2355
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:43,180
They're calling some updates.
They call out.

2356
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:43,990
You get bored.

2357
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:47,140
They do it at night sometimes,
but my boy doesn't do that.

2358
01:38:47,141 --> 01:38:48,520
The boys really quiet.
He's a boy.

2359
01:38:48,521 --> 01:38:50,050
Doesn't really do that.
But the girl,

2360
01:38:50,051 --> 01:38:51,570
she's first of all,
my girl cuts.

2361
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:54,020
Super flick and needy man.
And so she'd be like,

2362
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:00,720
anytime I'm near you met.
She's like that like anytime you're 

2363
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,301
near.
And she only does that to me because my 

2364
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:04,030
wife,
my wife is allergic to cats so she can't

2365
01:39:04,031 --> 01:39:09,031
be like fucking with this cat.
So the cat gets most of the affection 

2366
01:39:09,031 --> 01:39:09,031
from me.
So when I'm around.

2367
01:39:09,031 --> 01:39:09,031
So

2368
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,540
bill the night,
you just hear here,

2369
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,160
now

2370
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,080
I got to open the door and go,
shut the fuck up.

2371
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:24,200
Jesus.
You need a bitch as a father clock.

2372
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,540
They don't even seem to understand as 
well.

2373
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:29,260
Wow.
Wow.

2374
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:34,400
And she's not horny.
She's 16 years old and she's fixed.

2375
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:36,530
Okay.
So that's not the issue.

2376
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,700
She's just been a ed bitch.

2377
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:46,900
mostly what?
I'm fucking bored.

2378
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:53,890
You don't have any mIce in this house.
It's funny watching babies crush ants.

2379
01:39:55,641 --> 01:39:59,300
They don't give a fuck about ants that 
are yucky killed death.

2380
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:02,210
My little two year old,
just crushing ants and then it goes like

2381
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:07,211
this with a little bodies just flicks 
her finger and they're out of her 

2382
01:40:07,211 --> 01:40:10,421
consciousness.
Like she would never do that with a 

2383
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:10,421
mouse.
Like you couldn't stump a mouse and just

2384
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:11,750
like kick his body into a corner 
somewhere.

2385
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:13,790
He'd be like,
oh look at this mess.

2386
01:40:13,791 --> 01:40:16,580
You got to clean up.
But there's a certain level of dead body

2387
01:40:16,581 --> 01:40:19,400
where we just tolerate it laying around 
and that's ants.

2388
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:21,620
He can't do it with a roach.
You got clean up.

2389
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,020
Your big,
the disgusting.

2390
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:25,760
Now fly.
You got to pick up.

2391
01:40:25,761 --> 01:40:27,470
Unless you're A dude,
if you're a dude,

2392
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:29,900
you're watching tv and swat a fly like,
oh yeah,

2393
01:40:29,901 --> 01:40:30,320
I got them.

2394
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,760
Fuck them.
Like on a table.

2395
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,980
You might like might get up during the 
commercial,

2396
01:40:33,981 --> 01:40:36,360
wipe it off,
you just flick it and forget it,

2397
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:41,520
but like a roach that's big enough where
you got to care or when you get to like 

2398
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,850
mice and shit like that.
Anything that's got hair,

2399
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,340
you can't just kill it.
Caterpillar clean it up.

2400
01:40:46,341 --> 01:40:47,450
What does that.
Why do we.

2401
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,920
I mean we have obviously have a 
detachment based on the fact that it's 

2402
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:52,970
out of sight,
out of mind thing.

2403
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:57,070
Little tiny ant and you crush it,
but the other thing is it's like there's

2404
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,090
so many of them.
It's hard to give a fuck about them.

2405
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:04,570
It's true.
There's so many ants that the mass of 

2406
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:07,250
the weight of ants on earth is about the
same as the weight of humans.

2407
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:10,700
Yeah.
Google that.

2408
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,990
Google that.
That's real.

2409
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:13,550
I'm not making that up.
Sleep tonight.

2410
01:41:13,551 --> 01:41:14,540
Yeah,
of course.

2411
01:41:14,541 --> 01:41:17,630
It's an estimation because we.
I haven't been asked to be on any scale.

2412
01:41:17,631 --> 01:41:19,370
Have you?
I mean they're really counting this.

2413
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:26,100
Is there a census where you have to 
fucking show up somewhere and count or 

2414
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:26,100
did the girls get to mail in their own 
way?

2415
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:30,940
Because then we start adding pounds all 
over the fucking place because no one's 

2416
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:30,940
honest,
right?

2417
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,810
You don't have those boner pills from my
aunts.

2418
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:37,130
They're made from an supposedly those 
boner pills.

2419
01:41:37,131 --> 01:41:37,980
Like what are they called again?

2420
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:41,330
Hot rod.
Six thousand or 5,000

2421
01:41:41,331 --> 01:41:42,150
hot rod.
5,000.

2422
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:44,000
But supposedly there's ants in them 
that,

2423
01:41:44,001 --> 01:41:45,180
you know,
the extract ants.

2424
01:41:45,181 --> 01:41:46,280
And I'm thinking,
wow.

2425
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:50,540
So that means there's somebody and it's 
like an ant farmer that has distract the

2426
01:41:50,541 --> 01:41:51,800
ants and instead,
look,

2427
01:41:51,801 --> 01:41:54,370
you buy this little bump.
You're making bone or your

2428
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:56,460
stop.
First of all,

2429
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:57,990
stop.
You got to.

2430
01:41:57,991 --> 01:42:02,991
Before we started talking about this 
online google and find out if they 

2431
01:42:02,991 --> 01:42:02,991
actually make this shit,
right?

2432
01:42:02,991 --> 01:42:03,160
Yeah,
it does.

2433
01:42:03,161 --> 01:42:04,090
I mean,
why would I,

2434
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:06,040
why would I read a bottle and be like,
oh,

2435
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:06,930
I guess it's a.

2436
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:09,230
Why would you read that?
A dolphin as nipples inside.

2437
01:42:09,231 --> 01:42:11,510
It's because I can show you five 
websites that say that.

2438
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:11,930
No,
no,

2439
01:42:11,931 --> 01:42:14,600
no.
You can show me one website that has one

2440
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:17,120
article and they all copied it and put 
it on their website.

2441
01:42:17,121 --> 01:42:19,880
I looked.
It's the same exact story verbatim.

2442
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:20,160
Okay,

2443
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:25,170
well this is on the actual bottle,
so unless they just decided to like,

2444
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:26,850
okay,
that's good.

2445
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:31,930
It says it has aunts.
It's something an extract.

2446
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:36,070
It's an ant extract type in x and that's
what they're calling it,

2447
01:42:36,071 --> 01:42:37,360
man.
It's fucking cialis,

2448
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,850
you know,
that um,

2449
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:41,530
that brazilian wandering spiders,
that's what they're trying to figure out

2450
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:46,531
what that thing,
why it causes erections and they're 

2451
01:42:46,531 --> 01:42:47,230
going to try to turn that into like the 
next supervisor aggro.

2452
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,840
You've heard of That shit.
The brazilian wondering spider.

2453
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:53,980
It kills you and gives you this 
unbelievable boner before you die.

2454
01:42:53,981 --> 01:42:58,981
Most people die of it,
but apparently if you live your dick's 

2455
01:42:58,981 --> 01:42:58,981
done,
it's just like,

2456
01:42:58,981 --> 01:43:00,220
it's like taking an engine and just red 
lining.

2457
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:02,890
Okay.
just,

2458
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:03,890
you know,
it's,

2459
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:08,910
it's hitting the fucking the bottom of 
the tac officer and then it just 

2460
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:09,080
explodes.
The engine blows up.

2461
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:11,700
So most people,
they,

2462
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:14,320
they don't live from it,
but if you do live your dick's broken.

2463
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:19,321
So they're trying to take that as smart 
people would turn that into a boner 

2464
01:43:19,321 --> 01:43:19,321
pills.
I don't know man.

2465
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:24,830
Here's the extract.
This one is just another one super aunt 

2466
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:24,910
and it's a,
it's a,

2467
01:43:24,911 --> 01:43:29,080
you can buy it for $34 and it's just 
extracted aunts and they're wildly used.

2468
01:43:29,081 --> 01:43:31,690
An agent promotes strength,
sexual vego law,

2469
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,320
vigor,
vigor,

2470
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:37,860
powerpoint,
anti aging thing.

2471
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:39,370
So.
So we have all these ants.

2472
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:44,030
There's so much fucking that a fucking 
all have boners the same error

2473
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:49,130
knucklehead.
I don't think you're talking about the 

2474
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:49,130
same ants.
I bet.

2475
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:49,130
I bet that's a very specific type of 
answer.

2476
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:52,110
Does the fda have to say,
but when 50 percent ground raw and

2477
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:58,130
extra,
does it say that ground raw aunts and 

2478
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:58,130
aunt extract?
Yep.

2479
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:02,860
What that means.
They've taken a bunch of ants and 

2480
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:03,380
extracted it.
So each book,

2481
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:05,490
that's what I'm sending each pill you 
take.

2482
01:44:05,491 --> 01:44:09,540
IT's like $500 million ants.
Probably boners all adds up.

2483
01:44:09,541 --> 01:44:10,620
And it analogy is that

2484
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:14,450
they have celery and celery juice 
altogether in the same bowl,

2485
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,240
right?
The aunt and the aunt extract.

2486
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:18,780
So there's crush up the.
Yeah.

2487
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:23,570
So the aunt is like the hard part and 
then the extract is like the gooey stuff

2488
01:44:23,571 --> 01:44:25,400
that keeps it all together.
Yeah.

2489
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:26,570
Meanwhile,
probably does nothing.

2490
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:31,590
I'm going to create a salamander pill 
tomorrow that makes yoU live 10 yearS 

2491
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:32,800
longer.
People will Buy it.

2492
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:35,020
I might give you one of theSe hot duncan
swears by it.

2493
01:44:35,021 --> 01:44:36,160
Now I wonder what

2494
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:40,210
like who writes these supplement 
critiques?

2495
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:44,200
and it's like all talking about how hard
your cockiness.

2496
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:48,130
Oh,
I've heard of this stuff before though.

2497
01:44:48,131 --> 01:44:53,131
It's called um,
uri coma long full leah and it's 

2498
01:44:54,701 --> 01:44:57,580
supposed to be a natural testosterone 
booster also.

2499
01:44:57,581 --> 01:44:58,950
This stuff,
um,

2500
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:04,440
I think this stuff has a lot of shit in 
it that's probably would give you a 

2501
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:04,690
boner,
whether it's the aunt,

2502
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,380
maybe that's.

2503
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:06,620
Well,
that's one of the things.

2504
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:08,440
It's just one of the ingredients in 
this,

2505
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:09,870
but that long fully shit

2506
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:12,250
that is supposed to be a testosterone 
booster.

2507
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,670
There's a few of those is something 
called tongue got ali.

2508
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,590
That's supposed to be a natural and then
it's tribulus,

2509
01:45:17,591 --> 01:45:22,060
which everybody knows,
which apparently varies pretty widely in

2510
01:45:22,450 --> 01:45:27,450
strength and efficacy.
I think it's sorta like garlic or some 

2511
01:45:27,611 --> 01:45:28,900
things like you'll,
you'll get garlic,

2512
01:45:28,901 --> 01:45:30,430
it's not that strong and sometimes 
you'll get it.

2513
01:45:30,431 --> 01:45:31,720
You're like,
holy shit,

2514
01:45:31,721 --> 01:45:36,721
this is powerful garlic,
or like the way a tomato tastes like a 

2515
01:45:36,721 --> 01:45:40,381
beef steak.
Tomatoes from someone's backyard versus 

2516
01:45:40,381 --> 01:45:40,900
one of those pale tomatoes.
I think you'd get that same sort of shit

2517
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:45,901
with a lot of these herbal supplements.
I bet if you could get that stuff like 

2518
01:45:45,901 --> 01:45:49,720
from the plant instead of like some 
ground up powdered bullshit.

2519
01:45:49,721 --> 01:45:52,630
I bet if you get like tribulus,
I think tribulus or route,

2520
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:53,890
right?
Was it a route?

2521
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:59,040
I'm not sure.
I bet if you get that shit right from 

2522
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,040
the tree,
make declicker.

2523
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,040
Damn.

2524
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,460
I found that you shouldn't take any of 
these pills.

2525
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:05,470
If you do ecstasy at the same time,
you can fuck your shit up really bad.

2526
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,260
Break your heart,
your heart,

2527
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:10,160
your heart.
Maybe you are a bitch to be fun,

2528
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:15,730
but that seems like the best mix,
but yeah,

2529
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,930
that's what eddie bravo calls.
Phone or flip flops to see.

2530
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:20,480
Oh my agro.
Crazy.

2531
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:21,950
What?
You don't have to take these pills.

2532
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:22,390
No,
no,

2533
01:46:22,391 --> 01:46:23,090
no,
but what I'm saying,

2534
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:28,091
you shouldn't take viagra or any of this
stuff because if it has any kind of the 

2535
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:30,380
biafra or you're not supposed to take 
that with ecstasy,

2536
01:46:30,381 --> 01:46:32,720
there's some real dangers there.
Yeah,

2537
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,160
it fucks your heart up.
Bullshit.

2538
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:39,190
Google it.
Let's don't take viagra with agora 

2539
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:39,610
ecstasy.
I learned it on air or air,

2540
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:41,510
whatever that arrow in the.
Oh really?

2541
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:42,370
Yeah.
Okay.

2542
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:43,240
Era,
would I?

2543
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:44,480
Yeah,
I still did it,

2544
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:45,110
but whatever.

2545
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:49,080
While you were living on the edge and 
you're,

2546
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,900
you're a wild man.
Well,

2547
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:53,140
let's say don't take viagra with 
ecstasy.

2548
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,080
Sex to see.
Don't mix,

2549
01:46:56,570 --> 01:46:58,120
but I know so many people that say it's 
awesome.

2550
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:58,900
Oh yeah,
it does.

2551
01:46:59,090 --> 01:47:04,090
Because they don't know.
You shouldn't be doing it well and you 

2552
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:04,090
shouldn't be drinking.
Yeah.

2553
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:04,090
Yeah.
Use that stuff.

2554
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:06,480
Kills you.
You smoke it.

2555
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:08,690
When I'm on,
when I'm on ecstasy,

2556
01:47:08,691 --> 01:47:13,691
I usually don't drink that much.
I usually just drink orange juice and 

2557
01:47:13,691 --> 01:47:14,930
water and gatorade and fucking tons of 
water and appeal it,

2558
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,210
and

2559
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:18,220
there's several dangers and combining 
viagara and ecstasy.

2560
01:47:18,221 --> 01:47:23,221
First of all,
soc is a powerful mind altering drug 

2561
01:47:23,221 --> 01:47:23,221
that impairs judgment.
When I talked like that,

2562
01:47:23,221 --> 01:47:24,910
it means I'm reading something,
combining it with viagra.

2563
01:47:24,911 --> 01:47:28,120
It encourages people to engage in unsafe
and risky sexual behavior,

2564
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:31,420
aka brian's whole life.
Okay,

2565
01:47:31,421 --> 01:47:33,400
so you're saying that it's dangerous 
because of that,

2566
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:38,820
public health officials feel this combo 
will increase the spread of aids and 

2567
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:39,220
slash or other sexually transmitted 
diseases.

2568
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:41,530
First of all,
if you have a real medical issue,

2569
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:43,180
here's what happens.
First of all,

2570
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:48,300
you don't say that first,
so I don't believe them because that 

2571
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,620
saying that first means that the most 
important thing is to stop,

2572
01:47:50,621 --> 01:47:52,480
but sex,
that's what you're trying to do.

2573
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:57,540
You're trying to stop aids.
You try to say that people are going to 

2574
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,000
get sexually crazy and sexually risky.
Okay?

2575
01:47:58,001 --> 01:48:00,490
That is not an argument.
You can't tell me what I'm going to do.

2576
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:01,710
You can't tell me,
you know,

2577
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:03,730
I can handle Being drunk.
I don't drive when I'm drunk,

2578
01:48:03,731 --> 01:48:06,110
I don't get fucked up and go buttfuck.
Okay?

2579
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:11,690
What you're telling me that ecstasy is 
such a touching drug that when you have 

2580
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:13,710
a raging boner on top of it,
it's pretty dangerous.

2581
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:16,610
I don't think it's dangerous.
I don't think it's dangerous at all.

2582
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:21,700
I think it's dangerous for some people.
Just like cars are dangerous for some 

2583
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:21,700
people.
If you give them a cell phone,

2584
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:23,810
they text because some people have 
shitty fucking self control,

2585
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:26,480
but I don't think that this.
There's no,

2586
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:29,840
there's no like argument medically in 
that.

2587
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:35,370
I mean there might be this thing called 
[inaudible] and [inaudible] is like the 

2588
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:35,370
boners that won't go down.
Oh,

2589
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:40,070
that's just from taking ecstasy or are 
viagara rather that you can get that in 

2590
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:42,140
a viagara situation.
Like the fact that you're on ecstasy,

2591
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:44,570
that it doesn't.
It makes it worse because now every time

2592
01:48:44,571 --> 01:48:46,370
you take guys like better.
Yeah,

2593
01:48:46,371 --> 01:48:49,620
you're dick has a heartbeat and then you
need to have somebody swallow that.

2594
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:54,870
So few people have that problem with 
those boner pills where they actually 

2595
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:55,790
have to go to a doctor because if you 
have that,

2596
01:48:55,850 --> 01:48:59,090
that that's like an erection that you 
have to go to a doctor for,

2597
01:48:59,091 --> 01:48:59,840
right?
Yeah,

2598
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:00,500
yeah,
no,

2599
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,000
no,
no.

2600
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,680
It even says on the commercial owners 
may last up to three days

2601
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:08,640
that disease though that priapism,
the erection,

2602
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:11,220
which is the technical term that can 
kill your dick.

2603
01:49:11,221 --> 01:49:14,400
Just like the brazilian wandering spider
can kill your dick.

2604
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:16,530
It's the same thing.
The exact same thing.

2605
01:49:16,531 --> 01:49:18,060
In fact,
don't go into the jungle.

2606
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:18,720
Well,
if you can.

2607
01:49:18,721 --> 01:49:22,080
oh deon viagra.
Like say it is a check and you bang.

2608
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:24,690
You're dying to have sex with her and 
you think tonight is the night,

2609
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:29,691
but you're so scared that you're afraid 
that you're never gonna be able to get 

2610
01:49:29,691 --> 01:49:29,691
it up because you just got to be in a 
panic.

2611
01:49:29,691 --> 01:49:29,691
You know?
You know what?

2612
01:49:29,691 --> 01:49:34,230
I'm going to take six viagara just in 
case is so hot and then your crazy ass,

2613
01:49:34,231 --> 01:49:36,800
which by the way exists.
I'm sure some dudes.

2614
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:43,190
Sure.
and just decide that they want a dick 

2615
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:45,390
that's purple.
Just an angry purple bursting cock.

2616
01:49:45,391 --> 01:49:48,110
Like a ballpark frank,
one of those ballpark

2617
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:51,120
franks that you like to spend.
Not like an amateur would do it.

2618
01:49:51,121 --> 01:49:56,121
And like burn the outside.
Know a slow cooker where that 

2619
01:49:56,121 --> 01:49:58,710
motherfucker's greasy and sweating and 
just getting gigantic die.

2620
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:02,630
That's what your dick looks like and you
start to slowly see little splits in the

2621
01:50:02,631 --> 01:50:07,631
scenes.
We have thin red lines around your cock 

2622
01:50:07,631 --> 01:50:10,640
and various places because the skin is 
fucking bursting like a stretch mark and

2623
01:50:10,641 --> 01:50:15,641
a fat lady stomach after she has three 
kids inside of it and they pop out 

2624
01:50:15,641 --> 01:50:17,060
triplets and then her skin has to go 
back to normal.

2625
01:50:17,061 --> 01:50:22,061
That's what your dick looks like.
that kind of stretched out crazy scar 

2626
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:26,111
tissue where your dick,
it's just barely holding on like a 

2627
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:29,801
fucking balloon that's being pushed to 
the limit is just got up and went to 

2628
01:50:32,151 --> 01:50:34,070
take root.
That's how thrilling my story was.

2629
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:37,470
He's on ecstasy all blowing up.
Dick is too much.

2630
01:50:37,471 --> 01:50:38,270
He's going to go beat off.

2631
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:42,350
Guaranteed right now.
Imagine you on viagra in you are.

2632
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:47,410
You were fucking peaking on ecstasy and 
you have this crazy rock hard boner and 

2633
01:50:47,601 --> 01:50:52,601
you're in a waterbed with this guy.
It that those two medications might 

2634
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,930
cause you to like just figuring it out.

2635
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,790
Don't forget that's the dude rather.
Yeah,

2636
01:50:57,791 --> 01:51:00,190
that's a strange look.
This guy had brian pulled up,

2637
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,770
has long blonde,
beautiful hair,

2638
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:07,930
and he also has a dark,
dark beard and somebody put that online,

2639
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:09,880
give the dude props,
who is a put that online,

2640
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:13,690
rhubarb rhubarb with the wolverine 
avatar,

2641
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:18,720
so you know he's got some taste powerful
x men fan and this guy has a some sort 

2642
01:51:19,301 --> 01:51:24,301
of a g string type thing up his butt 
crack and he's very well built and it 

2643
01:51:24,301 --> 01:51:27,100
looks very handsome.
Perhaps middle eastern art or spanish,

2644
01:51:27,101 --> 01:51:29,320
maybe a spaniard,
but like a thick weightlifting.

2645
01:51:29,410 --> 01:51:31,390
Dave navarro,
I think it was a nice,

2646
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:33,670
thick,
solid and tight as the underground would

2647
01:51:33,671 --> 01:51:34,450
say.
Yeah,

2648
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:35,560
he's a.
That's a big boy.

2649
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:37,000
That guy's got some horsepower to his.

2650
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:42,190
So you're an ecstasy.
But viagra in a waterbed at a fucking w.

2651
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:44,610
It's looks like we're gonna fight to the
death.

2652
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:49,730
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I think they're trying to 

2653
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:51,651
say with this.
To try and not do it or fighting to the 

2654
01:51:51,651 --> 01:51:51,651
death.
That's what I think is going to happen.

2655
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,910
If you insist on pursuing this line

2656
01:51:58,330 --> 01:51:59,460
of action,
sir,

2657
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:04,680
we will have to fight to the death and 
the only other thing is the ecstasy 

2658
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:09,670
causes high blood pressure and 
dehydration and that viagra only worsens

2659
01:52:09,671 --> 01:52:14,671
those effects,
but all that means to me is that you 

2660
01:52:14,671 --> 01:52:14,671
have to drink water.
Like don't be stupid.

2661
01:52:14,671 --> 01:52:15,300
Yeah,
but sometimes when you're on ecstasy,

2662
01:52:15,301 --> 01:52:20,301
it's hard to even drink anything that 
you feel like you're going to puke it 

2663
01:52:20,301 --> 01:52:20,301
back up.
You know

2664
01:52:20,301 --> 01:52:20,301
what I didn't hear?
Hear?

2665
01:52:20,301 --> 01:52:22,090
I didn't hear strokes.
I didn't hear cancer.

2666
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:25,690
I didn't hear any of the shit that it 
would keep me from doing ecstasy and and

2667
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:27,700
viagra at the same time.
I heard nothing.

2668
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:29,230
I heard,
if this kills you,

2669
01:52:29,231 --> 01:52:30,700
you're kind of a pussy.
That's what I heard.

2670
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
That's what I'm getting out of this.
If you die from ecstasy and viagara 

2671
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:36,310
together,
you kind of a not saying you should take

2672
01:52:36,311 --> 01:52:37,960
viagra and excess together.
In fact,

2673
01:52:37,961 --> 01:52:40,490
I'm saying you definitely shouldn't take
viagra and extra city.

2674
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:45,640
It doesn't say nothing before the heart.
I'm saying you shouldn't for spiritual 

2675
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:46,800
reasons.
I think you know when you're involved in

2676
01:52:46,801 --> 01:52:48,780
that ecstasy feely,
touchy thing,

2677
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:51,210
it should be nonsexual.
It should be that you can't get it up.

2678
01:52:51,670 --> 01:52:56,670
Just enjoy it as a human being.
Everything doesn't have to be about 

2679
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:56,970
sticking your dirty loads places,
brian.

2680
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:00,330
Okay.
It doesn't have to be inside of us to be

2681
01:53:00,331 --> 01:53:02,640
all about you shooting loads all over 
the place.

2682
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:05,130
How will you let it go?
Pow and just be in the moment.

2683
01:53:05,131 --> 01:53:06,120
Hold hands with somebody.

2684
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:11,280
Okay.
I masturbated and it used a paper towel 

2685
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:15,151
to clean up and it's through it on my 
coffee table and then my friend came 

2686
01:53:15,151 --> 01:53:17,960
over and we were watching a show and she
goes like,

2687
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:19,820
she sneezed and she goes,
can I,

2688
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:20,950
can I use this paper towel?
I'm like,

2689
01:53:20,951 --> 01:53:23,710
sure,
I forgot that was the load paper towel.

2690
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,330
She's like,
oh,

2691
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:28,120
what song?
Over a nice.

2692
01:53:28,150 --> 01:53:33,150
Well that's a nice way to sort of get 
someone to touch your comment if you're 

2693
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:33,150
really into that.
Yeah,

2694
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:34,960
and a great.
None of my dna is on her hand.

2695
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:40,030
Yeah.
If you want it to come bomb somebody 

2696
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:40,030
speaking a combined,
and I got to thank chris

2697
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:44,350
calver.
He's the guy that made this a buddha 

2698
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:44,350
statue.
Oh,

2699
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:47,950
can you check this shit out?
There it is.

2700
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:50,990
That's cool as fuck man.
That's,

2701
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:51,970
that's your tattoo.

2702
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:56,460
It's exactly like pretty close.
He just made in a physical form with the

2703
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,340
third eye.
You can see it like that is like this.

2704
01:53:59,341 --> 01:54:01,860
And by the way,
this position that this thing is.

2705
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:06,950
I didn't ask him to do this,
but what's hilarious is that this is 

2706
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:11,211
exactly the reason I got this tattoo is 
because I had this crazy dmt trip that 

2707
01:54:12,091 --> 01:54:17,091
really like made me reassess.
RealIty made me reassess my life and one

2708
01:54:17,521 --> 01:54:21,000
of the most humbling aspects of the 
trip,

2709
01:54:21,001 --> 01:54:26,001
there was an infinite series of these 
golden buddhas that was flying in front 

2710
01:54:26,001 --> 01:54:29,400
of me and trying to explain like 
positive energy in life to me.

2711
01:54:29,850 --> 01:54:34,850
And um,
I turned it into a tattoo and it 

2712
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:37,380
literally looked like that in the dmt 
trip.

2713
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,450
Like literally looked just like this 
thing,

2714
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:44,870
except it was made out of some strange 
kind of light and there was no borders 

2715
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:45,210
to it,
if that makes any sense.

2716
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:48,250
It does.
Shouldn't do.

2717
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:53,280
Dmt has this very intense,
like almost like a two d sort of a thing

2718
01:54:54,721 --> 01:54:59,520
that happens sometimes where everything 
sort of seems connected on one plane,

2719
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:03,930
but then you realize that it's just this
crazy sort of fractal thing going on.

2720
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:06,390
And when that was happening in that 
trip,

2721
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:09,630
this is what I saw.
I saw these things just like everywhere.

2722
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:13,770
Would it mean to you man,
I was high as fuck kind of question.

2723
01:55:13,771 --> 01:55:16,720
Is that I don't know.
can't,

2724
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:17,970
can't,
can never.

2725
01:55:18,030 --> 01:55:19,590
Who knows when you're out on 
psychedelics,

2726
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,510
there's so mucH different shit that's 
going on.

2727
01:55:21,690 --> 01:55:23,730
Like for anybody to say,
I know that this happened.

2728
01:55:23,731 --> 01:55:26,970
I know that that happened and I have 
said those things you can't eat right.

2729
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:32,210
You know,
you don't know what the fuck happened 

2730
01:55:32,210 --> 01:55:32,210
were interpretation and you're on a 
fucking crazy drug man.

2731
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,930
There's a lot going on there.
You know,

2732
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:37,800
I wouldn't really bank on any one 
possible answer to any of your shit.

2733
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:39,330
True.
Do you,

2734
01:55:39,331 --> 01:55:40,620
um,
do you,

2735
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:41,620
um,
you,

2736
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:46,630
you play a lot of professional poker,
you take different things like before 

2737
01:55:46,630 --> 01:55:48,520
you deployed,
do you smoke when you do hormone?

2738
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:51,570
Dependent upon the area of I'm sure of 
course,

2739
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:57,430
yeah.
Because it can be tricky getting some 

2740
01:55:57,430 --> 01:55:57,430
weed and some spots.
Right?

2741
01:55:57,430 --> 01:55:58,240
Uh,
I would say,

2742
01:55:58,241 --> 01:56:03,241
I mean alpha brain the last year I've 
been taking and I found it to be 

2743
01:56:03,241 --> 01:56:05,260
beneficial.
Definitely it makes me more clear about,

2744
01:56:05,261 --> 01:56:08,880
you know what I mean?
Like when I take it I just feel like my

2745
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:10,740
thoughts are just clear.
They're clear.

2746
01:56:10,990 --> 01:56:12,560
Well if it,
it feels to me that you,

2747
01:56:12,561 --> 01:56:17,561
you're getting what your brain needs in 
order to function best to seems like 

2748
01:56:17,561 --> 01:56:18,180
that nutrition wise,
how many do you take?

2749
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:21,510
Usually just to do you take it right 
before you do an event?

2750
01:56:21,511 --> 01:56:22,440
Like how do you do it?

2751
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:27,620
Like when I play online,
like on sundays is the biggest day for 

2752
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:27,620
poker,
so I'll take it like when I wake up,

2753
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:29,250
like when I'm making my shake or 
whatever.

2754
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:32,060
I take four before every ufc for four.
Yup.

2755
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:34,320
It says on here you should only take a 
maximum for.

2756
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:34,970
Oh wait,
no.

2757
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:38,250
Says do not seek four capsules in 24 
hours.

2758
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,500
Okay.
Let's say I violated that too.

2759
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:42,810
Should I say for what?
You probably don't listen to me,

2760
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,100
but I do.
Yeah.

2761
01:56:44,101 --> 01:56:46,240
If I'm doing it like a ufc,
first of all you have fcs.

2762
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:51,560
It's a,
there's a lot that's going on like when 

2763
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:54,380
you're watching a fight and uh,
especially when it comes to describing 

2764
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:58,071
ground positions,
it's really hard to coordinate your 

2765
01:56:58,071 --> 01:56:58,071
thoughts.
Like,

2766
01:56:58,071 --> 01:57:02,091
okay,
he's got his right foot in this 

2767
01:57:02,091 --> 01:57:03,981
position.
Now what he's got to do to finish this 

2768
01:57:03,981 --> 01:57:03,981
off because he's got to turn his.
And I'm like,

2769
01:57:03,981 --> 01:57:08,601
god,
there's got to get his left foot 

2770
01:57:08,601 --> 01:57:08,980
underneath his right knee.
And then I got to get this all done.

2771
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I have to get it all out in a way that 
people are going to be able to 

2772
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:14,000
understand.

2773
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,680
While the fight is actually happening,
so I gotta kind of like manage.

2774
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:21,740
I have,
first of all I have to see what he's 

2775
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:23,031
doing so I have to know what direction 
he can do and what the counter could 

2776
01:57:23,031 --> 01:57:26,571
possibly be and then when I see a guy 
going after and I wanted to get the 

2777
01:57:26,571 --> 01:57:29,481
audience excited,
I want to say this is where he's in 

2778
01:57:29,481 --> 01:57:29,481
trouble.
Like you see this,

2779
01:57:29,481 --> 01:57:29,481
this is pulling down on his neck and 
he's,

2780
01:57:29,481 --> 01:57:31,980
he's in a bad situation here and if he 
could get his leg over here,

2781
01:57:31,981 --> 01:57:33,270
then it's over,
you know,

2782
01:57:33,271 --> 01:57:36,520
and the alpha brain and any,
any nootropics.

2783
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,540
I took that neuro one ship before I took
out.

2784
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,880
I noticed a difference.
I noticed that I could get sentences 

2785
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:43,880
out,
clear my thoughts,

2786
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:45,580
my thoughts,
my thoughts,

2787
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:50,780
my thoughts for it seemed like they 
formulate it easier and it just makes 

2788
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:50,780
sense.

2789
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:52,320
I mean there's isolated a bunch of 
different shit that improves your memory

2790
01:57:52,321 --> 01:57:57,321
statistically proven.
Like you can see people taking it and 

2791
01:57:57,321 --> 01:58:00,070
then people have done double blind tests
on different nootropics when it comes to

2792
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:05,240
memory enhancement.
And there's like prasad tam and a bunch 

2793
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:07,380
of different ones that are really 
interesting and it as this caffeine,

2794
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:12,381
you know,
caffeine has a performance enhancing 

2795
01:58:12,381 --> 01:58:12,381
quality to it as well.
Absolutely.

2796
01:58:12,381 --> 01:58:13,890
Because you're more jacked up.
There's some shit going.

2797
01:58:13,891 --> 01:58:16,320
I mean that's why you can only take in 
certain.

2798
01:58:16,321 --> 01:58:19,260
I think of the olympics and I think even
in the Nevada state athletic commission,

2799
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:22,200
they have a limit to how much caffeine 
of fighter can have in their system.

2800
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:27,270
I didn't know that she also had actually
a set of hip to that because he does it 

2801
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:31,701
in a pill form to make sure that he 
never takes more than than you're 

2802
01:58:31,701 --> 01:58:33,270
supposed to because you could get like 
starbucks,

2803
01:58:33,271 --> 01:58:35,070
like this one,
like a venti.

2804
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:40,130
If you have a starbucks,
venti and you compare that to like 

2805
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:40,130
coffee that you're going to get at 
jerry's deli.

2806
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:41,920
This is a big difference.
Yeah.

2807
01:58:41,970 --> 01:58:43,260
You mean?
Depends who makes it to.

2808
01:58:43,261 --> 01:58:44,460
I mean it might be just different,
you know,

2809
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:46,810
but more or less in there.
Yeah.

2810
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:49,530
The starbucks ones haven't seen amounts 
of caffeine.

2811
01:58:49,950 --> 01:58:53,850
So you might be possible to actually 
like piss hot for caffeine.

2812
01:58:54,030 --> 01:58:59,030
If you drank like a bunch of a it,
I wonder how many you would have to 

2813
01:58:59,030 --> 01:58:59,900
drink.
Like how many mentees?

2814
01:58:59,910 --> 01:59:02,970
I bet you could only drink a couple 
before you die.

2815
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:09,070
No,
there's dudes could drink that shit all 

2816
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:11,960
day following day.
Fully got to a point where he was 

2817
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:16,430
drinking so much coffee a day that he 
had a drink it black because he was 

2818
01:59:16,430 --> 01:59:19,560
drinking several quarts of half and half
a day.

2819
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:22,830
What saying,
dude,

2820
01:59:22,831 --> 01:59:24,980
I'm not bullshitting.
He used to.

2821
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:26,430
Oh yeah.
He doesn't give a fuck.

2822
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:27,870
He loves it.
He loves coffee.

2823
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:30,450
He used to drink it by the pot.
Just get him back on the podcast.

2824
01:59:30,451 --> 01:59:32,070
I missed that.
Kind of love the fuck out of that dude.

2825
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:34,540
He's a great guy.
There's um,

2826
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:40,250
there's a.
Why isn't the caffeine khan listed for 

2827
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:43,040
starbucks?
Beverage is apparently people want 

2828
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:45,050
caffeine.
Content is variable and starbucks 

2829
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:47,031
currently doesn't have any quantitative 
caffeine information for all of our 

2830
01:59:47,031 --> 01:59:50,361
beverages.
We intend on adding caffeine in 

2831
01:59:50,361 --> 01:59:50,361
information in a future upgrade.

2832
01:59:50,361 --> 01:59:51,110
I love that.
We into.

2833
01:59:51,390 --> 01:59:53,520
We don't have the.
I'm sorry,

2834
01:59:53,521 --> 01:59:55,410
I don't know why.
Almost shaking.

2835
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:57,600
Why am I shaking?
If I know to my coffee,

2836
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:00,840
I don't know.
I wonder if they even tested like they,

2837
02:00:00,841 --> 02:00:02,670
even though they probably test it and 
go,

2838
02:00:02,671 --> 02:00:05,880
what the fuck that closed the door 
light.

2839
02:00:05,881 --> 02:00:08,820
This place on fire.
Kill everybody that saw the results.

2840
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:14,050
We got to retreat and figure out what 
we're going to tell people before we 

2841
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:14,050
come back.
I bet starbucks,

2842
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:18,290
not only would they not tested,
they should find out what equipment is 

2843
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:20,790
used to test caffeine levels and buy 
them all out and burn them.

2844
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:22,460
Blow them up.
Okay.

2845
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:23,760
Because it's really clear.
We are

2846
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:27,050
red line people.
Fucking gills.

2847
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:28,470
Oh,
I don't think we know what we're doing a

2848
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:29,640
lot of stuff.
Yeah,

2849
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:32,100
there's apparently there's a caffeine 
database.

2850
02:00:32,101 --> 02:00:36,170
You can find out how much different 
things have in it and uh,

2851
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:39,660
it's all about milligrams per fluid 
ounce.

2852
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:43,080
And like say like,
if you would go with like a red bull.

2853
02:00:43,081 --> 02:00:44,670
Let's see if we could find red bull 
here.

2854
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:48,990
Some of them are crazy mad.
Holy shit.

2855
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:52,080
There's something called 50 1:50
juice.

2856
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,970
Okay.
It has 6,000

2857
02:00:57,330 --> 02:01:02,330
milligrams of caffeine per port,
per every 500 fluid ounces.

2858
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:10,130
I tell you,
I lived mostly off just a trenta a day 

2859
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:10,130
and you know,
coconut water,

2860
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:10,130
but

2861
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:10,490
that doesn't make sense.
Well,

2862
02:01:10,491 --> 02:01:11,710
hold on a second.
That doesn't make any sense.

2863
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:15,190
How is it 500 fluid ounces?
That's too low.

2864
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:20,240
Of course it would be much larger than 
everybody else's because everybody else 

2865
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:20,740
is like 11 fluid ounces,
six fluid ounces.

2866
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:22,960
So this is 500 flu announces.
What are they doing?

2867
02:01:22,961 --> 02:01:26,140
And measuring it for a jug.
That's so stupid.

2868
02:01:26,141 --> 02:01:28,020
Why?
How the fuck did that even get included?

2869
02:01:28,021 --> 02:01:28,250
I can't even

2870
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:31,520
because most people can't do the math to
get it done to where it needs to be.

2871
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,900
Oh,
500,

2872
02:01:33,130 --> 02:01:34,530
right.
So what you're saying,

2873
02:01:34,531 --> 02:01:35,760
brian,
you have a trenta

2874
02:01:35,950 --> 02:01:38,410
I haven't yet.
I'm pretty good on caffeine nowadays.

2875
02:01:38,411 --> 02:01:40,280
I usually drink a trenta

2876
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:45,310
and then you know,
coconut water and water most of the 

2877
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:45,310
most,
most of the time now.

2878
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:50,170
But uh,
I've been on those five hour energy 

2879
02:01:50,170 --> 02:01:50,480
drinks a lot lately.
Is there anything negative with drinking

2880
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:51,050
those,
you know,

2881
02:01:51,051 --> 02:01:52,670
because they're mostly what?
Be 12?

2882
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:52,910
Yeah,

2883
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:53,790
no,
it'd be 12.

2884
02:01:53,791 --> 02:01:56,060
Was water soluble.
You piss it out if you have too much and

2885
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:57,660
it's not dangerous.
It's very healthy.

2886
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:59,700
B,
12 is a really good supplement.

2887
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:02,730
More people should be on b.
Twelve is great for your immune system.

2888
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
B,
12 is just a good all around energy 

2889
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,611
supplement.
It's so good that like and people that 

2890
02:02:10,611 --> 02:02:12,531
work crazy hours,
video games sometimes like those guys 

2891
02:02:12,531 --> 02:02:13,120
that are forced to work like 16 hour 
days,

2892
02:02:13,121 --> 02:02:16,740
like many days in a row and then trying 
to complete a people on sets.

2893
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,420
They give them b,
12 shots.

2894
02:02:18,421 --> 02:02:19,800
It's like super,
super common.

2895
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:21,990
They give you intramuscular b,
12 shots.

2896
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:27,740
Then wrestlers do that.
A lot of wrestlers do that before they 

2897
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:30,261
compete.
They'll take like an intramuscular v12 

2898
02:02:30,261 --> 02:02:30,261
yeah,
it's so.

2899
02:02:30,261 --> 02:02:33,261
It's that healthy for you.
So it's way better than starbucks 

2900
02:02:33,261 --> 02:02:37,200
because starbucks,
I mean although it is delicious and I'm 

2901
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,741
drinking some right now,
there's a lot of fucking caffeine in 

2902
02:02:39,741 --> 02:02:40,920
that bitch.
A venti starbucks brewed coffee ready?

2903
02:02:40,950 --> 02:02:44,100
A regular cup of coffee that you would 
get at a diner.

2904
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:47,670
The average cup of coffee and eight 
ounce cup of coffee has a hundred and 80

2905
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:52,850
milligrams of caffeine,
a venti starbucks has 415 as tested in 

2906
02:02:54,001 --> 02:02:57,030
this test.
So I don't know if I'm,

2907
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:58,590
you know,
this test,

2908
02:02:58,800 --> 02:02:59,640
who knows?
I mean,

2909
02:02:59,641 --> 02:03:01,350
it might've been one really strong 
batch.

2910
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:03,300
I don't know how many batches they 
tested.

2911
02:03:03,301 --> 02:03:08,301
I don't know if this guy just made all 
these numbers up and put it on his 

2912
02:03:08,301 --> 02:03:08,301
websites,
which is

2913
02:03:08,301 --> 02:03:10,760
starbucks itself,
a caffeine free,

2914
02:03:10,761 --> 02:03:13,820
decaffeinated coffee that they add 12 
to.

2915
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,600
Well,
one of the things that is good idea,

2916
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:17,670
but one of the things that you,
uh,

2917
02:03:17,671 --> 02:03:21,630
you got to remember if you say 
decaffeinated decaf coffee,

2918
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:24,120
has caffeine in it.
Just very small amounts.

2919
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:25,140
No,
no.

2920
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,360
It has quite a lot.
In fact,

2921
02:03:27,361 --> 02:03:30,300
some people say that there are decaf 
coffee.

2922
02:03:30,301 --> 02:03:33,060
Let's,
let's find out like how much it has.

2923
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:35,510
So we already established that a tall.
Okay.

2924
02:03:35,511 --> 02:03:40,511
Let's just a tall brewed coffee from 
starbucks has 260 apoe apparently as 

2925
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:45,090
this guy saying.
So let's find out how much caffeine,

2926
02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:47,940
decaf hasn't it?
Because I know there's some in there and

2927
02:03:47,941 --> 02:03:50,070
it's not a little amount.
I think it'S a lot.

2928
02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:51,750
How much caffeine?

2929
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:54,920
I can't spell.

2930
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:58,280
Who told you that is what the fuck facts
that come?

2931
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:03,040
No.
Does decaf starbucks out of?

2932
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:03,580
No.
I know.

2933
02:04:03,610 --> 02:04:05,800
I know you can't get it all out on.
It.

2934
02:04:05,801 --> 02:04:09,430
Needs more food for the studio.
I'll have some sun in.

2935
02:04:09,970 --> 02:04:10,780
what?
Do you want more of those?

2936
02:04:10,781 --> 02:04:12,570
a buffalo things?
No.

2937
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:18,740
Is it true?
how much caffeine does decaf com 

2938
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:18,740
compare?
Contain?

2939
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:19,960
It must.
There's no,

2940
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:21,790
I guarantee you there's caffeine in 
there.

2941
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:27,560
So you play a lot of online pokers.
debbie noticed that there's a lot of 

2942
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:28,590
cheaters online.
Is there a lot of programs?

2943
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:31,020
I mean,
is it even fair to play online nowadays?

2944
02:04:31,050 --> 02:04:32,840
is a really good question.
Um,

2945
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:36,030
I'll just address that by telling you a 
story.

2946
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:38,190
When I was in,
I

2947
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:43,190
was in the library,
you know how they have those cubicles 

2948
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:43,680
with computers in them.
I was walking by and I,

2949
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:48,710
this was just when I got into poker and 
I looked in one and there was a guy 

2950
02:04:48,710 --> 02:04:49,350
playing poker,
so I was like,

2951
02:04:49,351 --> 02:04:54,351
oh,
knock on the door and see what's going 

2952
02:04:54,351 --> 02:04:54,351
on.
Knock on the door.

2953
02:04:54,351 --> 02:04:58,400
He opens up,
he's playing on the computer that they 

2954
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,521
have there.
He's playing on a laptop and then 

2955
02:05:01,521 --> 02:05:04,380
another laptop.
Now that wouldn't be that abnormal.

2956
02:05:04,381 --> 02:05:09,381
However,
he's playing the same six player 

2957
02:05:09,381 --> 02:05:11,541
tournament on all three.
So he essentially cs six cards out of 

2958
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:15,480
52,
which gives you a gigantic advantage.

2959
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:16,800
So yes,
there's shooting.

2960
02:05:16,801 --> 02:05:21,801
Absolutely.
So he's playing as three different 

2961
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:21,801
characters.
He's playing us.

2962
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:21,801
Yes,
exactly.

2963
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:22,650
So there's six people.
It's a call to sit and go.

2964
02:05:22,651 --> 02:05:26,390
So six people enter and then top to get 
paid is illegal.

2965
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:27,450
What are you doing?
No,

2966
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:28,560
absolutely not.
No.

2967
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,910
Wow.
So yeah,

2968
02:05:30,911 --> 02:05:32,460
it happens a lot.
Caffeine,

2969
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:35,340
um,
content of decaf is a much less.

2970
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:40,550
It says to label it decaf,
it must have at least 97 percent of the 

2971
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:44,271
caffeine removed.
So that leaves about five milligrams as 

2972
02:05:44,271 --> 02:05:46,860
compared to 100 to 150 for six ounces of
brewed coffee.

2973
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:51,861
They're saying 150.
The other one I think said a little bit 

2974
02:05:51,861 --> 02:05:51,861
more,
but I think it's variable obviously.

2975
02:05:51,861 --> 02:05:54,010
And as they're talking about six ounces.
So that's um,

2976
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,250
that's five milligrams.
It's not very much.

2977
02:05:56,350 --> 02:05:57,900
No,
I said that.

2978
02:05:57,950 --> 02:06:00,210
So it's definitely not going in.

2979
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:03,480
But if you're sensitive to caffeine and 
you drink quite a few of those,

2980
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:04,530
you got to think five,
10,

2981
02:06:04,531 --> 02:06:05,310
15,
20,

2982
02:06:05,311 --> 02:06:10,311
like it started.
Now you're starting to get to a point 

2983
02:06:10,311 --> 02:06:12,111
where you might feel it,
but as opposed to like 100 which was 

2984
02:06:12,111 --> 02:06:12,111
like a regular cup of coffee or more.

2985
02:06:12,111 --> 02:06:16,450
So to a point it is broken the online 
poker because you can pretty much Just 

2986
02:06:16,450 --> 02:06:20,471
gang up on people.
so like a single new person sitting 

2987
02:06:20,471 --> 02:06:24,701
there,
you can just pretty much play all the 

2988
02:06:24,701 --> 02:06:24,701
other characters.
Fucking rolled again.

2989
02:06:24,701 --> 02:06:27,800
Yeah.
so the problem is with cash games and 

2990
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:27,800
with,
with smaller tournaments,

2991
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:28,740
when you get bigger tournaments,
I have 10,000

2992
02:06:28,741 --> 02:06:30,420
players in them.
It's not such a big deal.

2993
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,840
But yeah,
there's definitely some cheating going 

2994
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:35,840
on and I've,
you know,

2995
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:36,960
I've had multiple times where I'm like,
there's something fishy going on here.

2996
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:41,340
What about bots behind an issue?
Not really.

2997
02:06:41,341 --> 02:06:46,341
They can be like low stakes,
but when you get people that recognize 

2998
02:06:46,341 --> 02:06:48,080
patterns,
good players that recognize patterns,

2999
02:06:48,081 --> 02:06:50,040
they're going to know you're a button,
just take advantage of it.

3000
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,410
But when you're,
um,

3001
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:53,160
I,
I heard this has been done,

3002
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:58,220
I don't know if it's still being done,
but let's say if you would go into a 

3003
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:01,491
room and it was like a six person table,
like they're allowed to have artificial 

3004
02:07:01,491 --> 02:07:02,970
people.
They're allowed to have,

3005
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:05,880
like,
they could run a bot that's playing you.

3006
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:07,140
I don't think,
uh,

3007
02:07:07,150 --> 02:07:07,710
it's,
it's,

3008
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:08,830
it's allowed.
No,

3009
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:10,260
no,
I don't think it's allowed.

3010
02:07:10,261 --> 02:07:11,850
I think um,
when the sites find them,

3011
02:07:11,851 --> 02:07:12,900
they,
they shut them down.

3012
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:14,070
Okay.
So that's,

3013
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,690
that's just misinformation.
Yeah.

3014
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:19,920
So if someone says that they played 
against three bots and one other dude,

3015
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:21,180
it's not right?
Well,

3016
02:07:21,181 --> 02:07:24,180
they may have been but,
but it's not like it's not illegal.

3017
02:07:24,181 --> 02:07:25,320
Yeah.
You're not supposed to do that.

3018
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:30,350
Where is it legal to gamble now?
Still not legal to gamble if it's an 

3019
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:30,690
american website,
right.

3020
02:07:30,691 --> 02:07:33,750
We're not allowed to play poker.
I'm home skins consulting adults.

3021
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,960
You're not even allowed to play poker 
poker with money.

3022
02:07:35,961 --> 02:07:36,920
Right?
We can do that still,

3023
02:07:36,921 --> 02:07:40,230
but only only in vegas and casinos and 
casinos.

3024
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:45,650
You're at home like are you allowed to 
have a poker game with a bunch of your 

3025
02:07:45,650 --> 02:07:48,191
friends and you have like stacks of 
hundreds on the table and getting crazy 

3026
02:07:48,191 --> 02:07:48,191
and drinking.

3027
02:07:48,191 --> 02:07:48,191
Is that illegal?
No.

3028
02:07:48,191 --> 02:07:48,220
Well,
yes.

3029
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:49,660
The way it is,
like if,

3030
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:51,670
if the house takes a rake,
it's illegal.

3031
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,920
If you're just playing with your friends
and you know,

3032
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:55,510
it seems like five bucks.
You say,

3033
02:07:55,511 --> 02:08:00,511
hey,
we'll play for five bucks and what have 

3034
02:08:00,511 --> 02:08:00,511
you played for $50,000?
That's fine.

3035
02:08:00,511 --> 02:08:00,511
I think as long as there's no rape being
collected.

3036
02:08:00,511 --> 02:08:01,120
Really?
Yeah.

3037
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:03,310
Is that true?
I don't actually,

3038
02:08:03,311 --> 02:08:06,040
I don't know that for a fact,
but I'm pretty sure that's where it is.

3039
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:09,010
I feel like you would have to pay taxes 
on that shit and then it's illegal,

3040
02:08:09,011 --> 02:08:10,600
but still have to pay taxes.
You have to,

3041
02:08:10,601 --> 02:08:12,490
you have to claIm the claim it.
Yeah.

3042
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:17,670
That's another reason why they made it 
illegal here is because the taxes were 

3043
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:21,751
just,
they were not being paid by a lot of 

3044
02:08:21,751 --> 02:08:22,510
people because it's based off shore.
It was based in Ireland,

3045
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:25,420
uh,
england and Costa Rica.

3046
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:26,510
What were the three big assignment?

3047
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:28,230
Isn't that a,
you know,

3048
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:32,250
irs problem?
How could they deny the entire.

3049
02:08:32,370 --> 02:08:34,020
I mean,
it seems like as a technology issue,

3050
02:08:34,021 --> 02:08:36,600
how could you deny an entire industry 
they weren't getting paid off.

3051
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:41,670
It's about the money.
They're not getting revenue because the 

3052
02:08:41,670 --> 02:08:43,951
sites are based offshore,
so they're only getting revenue when 

3053
02:08:43,951 --> 02:08:43,951
people pay their taxes.

3054
02:08:43,951 --> 02:08:48,530
People that have sites on shore and then
make the money from that and then say,

3055
02:08:48,590 --> 02:08:53,590
yeah,
and then say if you have an offshore 

3056
02:08:53,590 --> 02:08:53,590
when you have to pay taxes on it or 
we'll get you.

3057
02:08:53,590 --> 02:08:57,330
Listen,
there's a lot of thIngs in this world 

3058
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:57,330
that just don't make any sense.
I could fix so much.

3059
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:58,180
Just simple logic,
logic.

3060
02:08:58,330 --> 02:08:59,910
Hey listen,
I mean it's,

3061
02:08:59,911 --> 02:09:02,500
it's incredibly terrible that I have to 
play.

3062
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:03,890
I mean,
I like Mexico.

3063
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:05,080
I'm right on the beach.
It's beautiful.

3064
02:09:05,081 --> 02:09:09,430
There's a lot of dolphins swimming by,
but like that where you live right now?

3065
02:09:09,431 --> 02:09:10,990
Yeah,
I'm live in Mexico.

3066
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:12,250
I have a house.
He lives there too,

3067
02:09:12,251 --> 02:09:13,870
right?
Jc still live in Mexico city?

3068
02:09:13,871 --> 02:09:15,100
I think so,
yeah.

3069
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:20,820
So you live in Mexico near the beach.
You don't say where because they will 

3070
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:21,330
come get you.
They'll know about.

3071
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,380
I live right on the beach.
It's beautiful.

3072
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:25,330
I love listening to the way as I go to 
sleep.

3073
02:09:25,331 --> 02:09:27,190
It's awesome.
But I miss a lot of,

3074
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,530
a lot of things about the states,
like the law,

3075
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,890
the law,
the food was a lot of things I missed,

3076
02:09:32,891 --> 02:09:33,250
you know.

3077
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:35,200
Um.
Have you ever seen any crazy shit living

3078
02:09:35,201 --> 02:09:36,820
in Mexico?
Have you seen some things that have made

3079
02:09:36,821 --> 02:09:37,450
you go,
oh,

3080
02:09:37,451 --> 02:09:38,920
okay,
we're not in Kansas anymore.

3081
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:44,550
One of the first days I was there,
I went for a run on the beach and 

3082
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:44,550
there's um,
like a,

3083
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:48,450
a cliff and it's kind of a secluded on 
one end and there were two people just 

3084
02:09:48,450 --> 02:09:50,500
banging it out rigHt there hanging out 
sexually.

3085
02:09:50,530 --> 02:09:52,450
Oh yeah,
that's fine.

3086
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:53,590
That was fine.
But no,

3087
02:09:53,591 --> 02:09:55,390
as far as like weird things,
I mean,

3088
02:09:55,391 --> 02:09:57,970
did you watch,
did you sit there and let them finish?

3089
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:01,320
I was looking right in his eyes.
What I'm saying is you don't see,

3090
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:05,350
you don't see very many like crime 
situation.

3091
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:07,150
No,
I don't put myself in positions to be in

3092
02:10:07,151 --> 02:10:08,890
that.
I basically stay in the resort the whole

3093
02:10:08,891 --> 02:10:10,770
time.
I mean I go out to go and get food.

3094
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:12,170
So you live in a resort?
Yeah,

3095
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:14,230
basically they have like pools and 
tennis courts,

3096
02:10:14,231 --> 02:10:17,000
basketball courts and stuff like that.
So you just stay in the resort base.

3097
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:20,320
Wow.
So you're like living in an apartment?

3098
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:25,340
Yeah.
That's surrounded by a whole nother 

3099
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:25,340
country that you don't venture into 
basically.

3100
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:29,740
Whoa.
I go in like probably I would say twice 

3101
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:29,740
a week.
That's a true.

3102
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:29,740
Are you a,
what's called an ex pat?

3103
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:31,840
Are you like an official ex pat?
I wouldn't consider myself an ex pat.

3104
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:33,920
But you live in Mexico?
Well I have a house in vegas.

3105
02:10:33,921 --> 02:10:34,850
I own a house.
Oh.

3106
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,550
So I rented it out while I go to Mexico 
and play.

3107
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:39,290
Wow,
that's cool.

3108
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:43,640
So you have to be in Mexico to do this.
I can't put like if I was right here and

3109
02:10:43,641 --> 02:10:45,170
I tried to fire it up,
it wouldn't let me.

3110
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:46,840
The ip will be blocked.
Wow.

3111
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:50,600
Wow.
And not only that,

3112
02:10:50,601 --> 02:10:55,601
but now there's millions and millions of
dollars that's doj has seized from full 

3113
02:10:55,601 --> 02:10:57,410
tilt poker.
That's just sitting there.

3114
02:10:57,411 --> 02:11:00,260
We haven't been paid that back yet.
so what they basically did was they shut

3115
02:11:00,261 --> 02:11:01,610
the site's down.
It was,

3116
02:11:01,611 --> 02:11:03,470
I think it was um,
April 15th,

3117
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:08,890
something like that.
They shut all the sites down and if you 

3118
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:10,630
had money online deck went to the doj 
and now you have to sub.

3119
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:14,000
You have to ask them for your money back
and we still can't get our money back.

3120
02:11:14,030 --> 02:11:16,220
Oh wow.
Good.

3121
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:18,400
Be creepy government.
It is.

3122
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:20,990
Yep.
Creepy fucking government,

3123
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,940
man.
I,

3124
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:23,390
I,
I'm just baffled that,

3125
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:25,760
you know,
against other consenting adults.

3126
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:27,580
I can't play poker with them.
Well,

3127
02:11:28,150 --> 02:11:29,210
it's really gross.

3128
02:11:29,290 --> 02:11:34,290
We allow grown adults to tell us what we
can and can't do when it comes to 

3129
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:36,580
situations like this that is not in.
That is not.

3130
02:11:36,610 --> 02:11:39,670
That's not a tax issue because it should
be completely unrelated.

3131
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:44,810
How how you pay your taxes should be 
your personal responsibility based on 

3132
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:44,830
what your actually income is.
Absolutely.

3133
02:11:44,831 --> 02:11:46,540
If you want to hide your gambling 
income,

3134
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:49,210
they should be able to find out or you 
only make $50,000

3135
02:11:49,211 --> 02:11:51,220
a year.
How do you have a $300,000

3136
02:11:51,221 --> 02:11:52,450
car?
So oh,

3137
02:11:52,451 --> 02:11:57,451
let's go online.
See this motherfucker plays poker all 

3138
02:11:57,451 --> 02:11:57,451
day and he's not reporting his winnings 
like I'm all for that.

3139
02:11:57,451 --> 02:11:59,020
I think everybody should have to pay 
their share,

3140
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:00,880
but you shouldn't be able to tell me 
what I can do.

3141
02:12:01,330 --> 02:12:02,350
That's stupid.
I agree.

3142
02:12:02,351 --> 02:12:03,010
I know.
You can see.

3143
02:12:03,011 --> 02:12:08,011
Look,
you can google anyone's name and see 

3144
02:12:08,011 --> 02:12:08,011
what they've won.
It's just,

3145
02:12:08,011 --> 02:12:08,011
it's out there.
It's all.

3146
02:12:08,011 --> 02:12:08,890
It's all public because when you cash in
a tournament,

3147
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:09,880
it shows it online.

3148
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:12,720
Yeah.
You know what about didn't know what was

3149
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:17,730
it filled?
Full tilt poker that got busted for 

3150
02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:17,730
fraud,
who got busted for fraud?

3151
02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:18,410
Absolute poker,
absolute poker.

3152
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:18,950
What would they do?

3153
02:12:18,970 --> 02:12:21,730
They had a guy that basically could see 
your whole cards,

3154
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:26,490
like an admin,
but yeah,

3155
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:29,010
he liked recreated some kind of.
I dunno,

3156
02:12:29,050 --> 02:12:34,050
I'm not very computer savvy,
but something that he could see every 

3157
02:12:34,050 --> 02:12:37,021
card at the table and what he was doing 
was he was just winning these insane 

3158
02:12:37,021 --> 02:12:38,350
amounts of money and not even trying to 
hide it.

3159
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:40,710
LIke for example,
uh,

3160
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:44,500
when he won a tournament,
he made a call at the last one,

3161
02:12:44,501 --> 02:12:47,170
the last car.
The river came out with 10 high.

3162
02:12:47,171 --> 02:12:48,210
I don't know if you play poker,
not,

3163
02:12:48,211 --> 02:12:51,340
but basically a call that you would net 
that I've never met in my life.

3164
02:12:51,850 --> 02:12:52,840
Okay.
Right.

3165
02:12:52,990 --> 02:12:57,990
Never because it's never good.
and he was right because he could see 

3166
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:57,990
the guys cards,
but it's like,

3167
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:58,540
how are you going to be that blatant 
about it?

3168
02:12:58,541 --> 02:13:03,541
If you could see that,
why would you not just play cool a 

3169
02:13:03,541 --> 02:13:03,940
little bit more discreet.
Exactly.

3170
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:09,320
Get third in the tournament once.
Maybe he's in prison now or is he does 

3171
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:09,320
the thing.
Man,

3172
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:11,260
there's the grid,
there's so much gray area with,

3173
02:13:11,261 --> 02:13:13,330
with poker and law,
so he's,

3174
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:14,360
he's not in jail.
Well,

3175
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:19,280
there was that guy who was trying to run
an mma organization as well.

3176
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:21,590
That bodog guy,
calvin era.

3177
02:13:21,591 --> 02:13:22,370
Was it?
YEs.

3178
02:13:22,371 --> 02:13:23,180
Yeah,
yeah.

3179
02:13:23,181 --> 02:13:25,550
He had like this whole thing that he was
doing.

3180
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:30,940
Well,
he was having these guys like fight on 

3181
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:32,561
the beach and you know,
this beautiful resort in Costa Rica or 

3182
02:13:32,561 --> 02:13:32,561
something like that.
you know,

3183
02:13:32,561 --> 02:13:32,561
he put the fights

3184
02:13:32,561 --> 02:13:32,640
like,
um,

3185
02:13:32,641 --> 02:13:33,900
the beach.
I saw his house.

3186
02:13:33,901 --> 02:13:35,790
I was in Costa Rica.
Golfing was on the golf course.

3187
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:36,930
He's a baller.
He's a baller.

3188
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:41,960
He's a powerful baller,
but he's forced to live in another 

3189
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:41,960
country.
He can't come to America.

3190
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:41,970
He comes to America.
He'd be arrested.

3191
02:13:41,971 --> 02:13:46,971
That'd be arrested.
Him and dana white where they had like 

3192
02:13:46,971 --> 02:13:47,130
this big go back and forth.
it was pretty hilarious.

3193
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:52,250
Twitter are longtime before twitter,
before on websites and interviews and 

3194
02:13:52,250 --> 02:13:53,820
stuff like that.
But he had like his picture,

3195
02:13:53,821 --> 02:13:58,821
like he would have these built bull 
billboards with like him in a beautiful 

3196
02:13:58,821 --> 02:13:59,520
suit with girls behind him.
Calvin,

3197
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:02,970
I or presents put dog fights like what a
solid man is selling.

3198
02:14:02,971 --> 02:14:05,920
You looking like a pimp,
but unsexy.

3199
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:10,960
He's selling the lifestyle.
That's what people are fascinated by 

3200
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:13,500
that not just fascinated by the fights.
They're fascinated by his lifestyle,

3201
02:14:13,620 --> 02:14:17,520
but he was forced into exile because of 
online gambling.

3202
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:20,370
Right.
And the crazy part about it is,

3203
02:14:20,371 --> 02:14:22,170
is a,
you can still gamble on horses,

3204
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:27,620
but you can get them on the lottery.
The lottery scratch tickets are 

3205
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:29,940
available at every gas station and 
that's chance poker is skill.

3206
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:34,970
I've had eight years of.
I've had one losing year out of eight 

3207
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:34,970
years.
Yeah.

3208
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:36,440
But that's,
uh,

3209
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:37,620
yeah,
that's rare.

3210
02:14:37,621 --> 02:14:38,760
That wasn't it.
Yeah.

3211
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,770
The three percent of people will make 
money playing poker.

3212
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,390
Three percent,
three percent.

3213
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:46,350
That's similar to professional pool and 
fighting as well.

3214
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:47,480
Yeah.
The top guys.

3215
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:52,490
How many comedians?
Pretty much everything and pretty much 

3216
02:14:52,490 --> 02:14:52,490
everything.
Yeah.

3217
02:14:52,490 --> 02:14:52,550
Right.
It makes it real.

3218
02:14:52,551 --> 02:14:53,410
If it's real money.
Yeah.

3219
02:14:53,411 --> 02:14:54,810
Yeah.
Ditch diggers often,

3220
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:57,950
like,
I think they all get the same amount for

3221
02:14:58,060 --> 02:14:59,130
them.
Dolphin,

3222
02:14:59,131 --> 02:15:00,190
sex doesn't even make sense,
bro.

3223
02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:05,450
Like,
how many times do people hang out with 

3224
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:05,450
dolphins and not fuck them?
Probably three percent.

3225
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:07,080
How many are successful that try to fuck
them?

3226
02:15:07,081 --> 02:15:08,400
That would be what it would be.
No,

3227
02:15:08,401 --> 02:15:10,800
because dolphins want to fuck back to 
shut the fuck up.

3228
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,630
Stop read it.
Can't be able to talk to you.

3229
02:15:13,170 --> 02:15:17,460
Can't believe I just engaged you back,
brought you back into the full pitch.

3230
02:15:18,430 --> 02:15:20,540
Um,
yeah.

3231
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:22,050
Most,
most poker players,

3232
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:24,440
what do they do to make a living?
It's what I do.

3233
02:15:24,470 --> 02:15:26,490
It's the only thing I do,
but most don't.

3234
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:29,040
Most.
Well I can't speak for everyone else.

3235
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:34,020
I know that there's probably maybe 50 
guys I can name them.

3236
02:15:34,021 --> 02:15:39,021
Make good money.
I mean there's some guys that make 

3237
02:15:39,021 --> 02:15:39,021
stupid money and they have like they,
they,

3238
02:15:39,021 --> 02:15:42,870
they're always into crazy bets.
Like they'll play golf for a million 

3239
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:42,870
dollars or something.
Yeah.

3240
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:47,000
Pretty normal isn't the top one percent 
that is so fucking crazy.

3241
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:52,220
It is.
To play a round of golf for a million 

3242
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:52,220
bucks.

3243
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:52,220
But that's so normal,
isn't it?

3244
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:53,350
Will you do those guys for them?
Yeah.

3245
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:55,620
Yeah.
I don't bet a million dollars.

3246
02:15:55,621 --> 02:16:00,621
Have you ever had a crazy bad about 
something like who's going to lose the 

3247
02:16:00,621 --> 02:16:03,771
most about a way to take the longest 
shit or because that's the kind of 

3248
02:16:03,771 --> 02:16:03,771
things they bet on.
Right?

3249
02:16:03,771 --> 02:16:05,310
I could ship the longest complete shit 
ever.

3250
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:10,340
We bet on a lot of weird things.
Like we bet one time we met a guy that 

3251
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:10,950
he wouldn't take a shot glass full of 
like steak rub.

3252
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:12,780
Hello?
Yeah,

3253
02:16:12,850 --> 02:16:13,980
he was a lot.
A little water.

3254
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:17,040
He did you know that that guy could die 
if that's all salt.

3255
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:19,680
I did not know that.
I think if you eat like a pound of salt,

3256
02:16:19,681 --> 02:16:24,681
you could die.
I guess the shot glass is not a pound 

3257
02:16:24,681 --> 02:16:28,240
shot glass,
but be submitted in that stake rep is 

3258
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:29,530
like more granulated space in between.

3259
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:31,730
It's not as heavY as like morton salt.
Right?

3260
02:16:31,750 --> 02:16:33,940
Like if you drank a shot glass of morton
salt,

3261
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:37,420
that would be impressive as fuck it.
Let's dig.

3262
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:39,400
rob's not quite heavy.
Like a.

3263
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:42,370
That's like a.
If you can stay in a pool for 24 hours,

3264
02:16:42,371 --> 02:16:45,220
things like that.
The state in a pool for 24 hours.

3265
02:16:45,221 --> 02:16:47,380
Who did that?
I don't remember his name,

3266
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,960
but he did take probably because he died
in that pool.

3267
02:16:50,290 --> 02:16:51,940
Um,
what about that guy?

3268
02:16:51,941 --> 02:16:56,941
Do you know him?
The famous gambler in vegas that 

3269
02:16:56,941 --> 02:16:56,941
actually got breast implants?
Do you know that story?

3270
02:16:56,941 --> 02:16:59,560
I think I remember seeing that a while 
ago on tv.

3271
02:16:59,561 --> 02:17:01,360
Um,
he wore them for a whole year.

3272
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:03,280
That was the,
that was the bet.

3273
02:17:03,310 --> 02:17:06,130
I don't know him personally.
Isn't a legendary.

3274
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:08,080
Isn't that guy legendary character?
What's his name?

3275
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:13,300
We're gOing.
I can tell you if he isn't telling me 

3276
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:13,300
his name had been on the show poker 
after dark.

3277
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:13,420
Nope.
Have not been on that.

3278
02:17:13,421 --> 02:17:14,980
I was on um,
one of the espn,

3279
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:17,020
a world series poker ones.
that's cool.

3280
02:17:17,070 --> 02:17:19,150
Yeah.
Actually like watching that show,

3281
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:20,860
what is the,
what is the,

3282
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:25,990
the most success you've had with poker?
You mean like most one in a day or 

3283
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,670
something?
Or most one like,

3284
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:29,560
you know,
ever $100,000.

3285
02:17:29,561 --> 02:17:31,750
The guy won.
He won $100,000.

3286
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:34,360
Looking at him there.
What was his name?

3287
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,160
Brian zen.
I don't know.

3288
02:17:38,230 --> 02:17:43,230
I've never cashed in on $100,000.
Bet by getting breast implants for a 

3289
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:43,390
year.
Yeah.

3290
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:45,160
I don't know.
Eight years later he still has them.

3291
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:46,750
Are you serious?
You keep them?

3292
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:47,620
Yeah.
See,

3293
02:17:47,621 --> 02:17:52,621
I think I would keep them too.
I think after a couple months he'd be 

3294
02:17:52,621 --> 02:17:52,621
like,
dude,

3295
02:17:52,621 --> 02:17:52,840
it's fucking high.
I had really nice tits.

3296
02:17:53,110 --> 02:17:54,670
Boobs are awesome.
I don't think that's what it is.

3297
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:57,380
I think he probably does it because he's
nuts.

3298
02:17:59,410 --> 02:18:03,010
As far as a.
I can tell you the most I've lost in the

3299
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:05,110
day.
It was 25 k wow.

3300
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:06,910
That's kind.
Suck it and that really sucked.

3301
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:09,010
But the wind was two.
Oh,

3302
02:18:09,011 --> 02:18:11,530
nine in a day.
Two hundred 9,000

3303
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:12,990
g's.
Louisa,

3304
02:18:13,370 --> 02:18:14,710
what did you.
What's the first thing you bought?

3305
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,300
Did you buy any?
I bought a lexus.

3306
02:18:16,390 --> 02:18:18,240
Nice.
Nice for cash.

3307
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,370
Nice.
Yeah,

3308
02:18:20,390 --> 02:18:22,030
it's quick.
that's a good car too,

3309
02:18:22,031 --> 02:18:23,530
because that's sounded like stepping out
of line.

3310
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:25,510
Not getting crazy.
Didn't go bentley.

3311
02:18:25,970 --> 02:18:26,640
No,
no.

3312
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:31,570
You bought like a sense of car.
That's a nice car that's out there right

3313
02:18:31,571 --> 02:18:32,310
now.
I love that car.

3314
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:33,820
It's really reliable.
I love it.

3315
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:35,410
That's the thing about lexis,
man.

3316
02:18:35,411 --> 02:18:38,580
Those things are bulletproof.
I had one of those big trucks as qx,

3317
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:41,190
whatever the fuck it was.
Amazing car man there.

3318
02:18:41,210 --> 02:18:42,850
So well designed to.
Yeah,

3319
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:48,190
they have that new one.
They have the new version of the ls 

3320
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:48,340
there.
They're big flagship sedan.

3321
02:18:48,930 --> 02:18:53,930
It might as well be a spaceship mean it.
Parks itself hit a button and it 

3322
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:57,200
parallel parks for you.
Like that has been nana's.

3323
02:18:57,210 --> 02:18:58,270
It's crazy.
The fucking thing.

3324
02:18:58,271 --> 02:18:59,500
Actually.
Parks for you.

3325
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:02,020
Cameras in the front,
cameras in the rear,

3326
02:19:02,021 --> 02:19:05,620
you know all this different shit that 
makes it run perfect.

3327
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:08,230
So it's amazing how like computer 
control and all these things.

3328
02:19:08,231 --> 02:19:10,720
Oh my god,
I can't wait until five to 10 years from

3329
02:19:10,721 --> 02:19:13,920
now will be the google car.
The car that's driving around now.

3330
02:19:13,921 --> 02:19:15,090
That's going to suck.
Dude.

3331
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:17,410
I'm going to lose all your fucking fun.
Yeah,

3332
02:19:17,411 --> 02:19:19,390
that's true.
It's true.

3333
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:21,580
It should be that.
You should have the option to do it that

3334
02:19:21,590 --> 02:19:24,670
way.
fuck that way.

3335
02:19:24,671 --> 02:19:27,770
or it's just on a table.
you should

3336
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:30,460
be able to have the option to either 
have the google car.

3337
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:32,330
Not like being able to almost like ride 
a train.

3338
02:19:32,331 --> 02:19:35,000
Like I just want to be fun for long 
trips,

3339
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:38,000
like a five hour drive and just sit 
there with your ipad or watch a movie.

3340
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:41,090
You wouldn't be able to avoid all the 
other crazy assholes.

3341
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,710
It didn't have google cars.
It's true.

3342
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:46,130
It's true.
Can switching lanes and shit and make it

3343
02:19:46,131 --> 02:19:51,131
even hit the brakes.
You'd probably be sitting there with no 

3344
02:19:51,131 --> 02:19:51,131
seatbelt to get in an accident.
You're probably not.

3345
02:19:51,131 --> 02:19:54,930
The lag is.
I wonder if they ever figure out that 

3346
02:19:54,930 --> 02:19:56,771
this accidents that are caused by the 
google car that w or caused because the 

3347
02:19:56,771 --> 02:20:00,881
google car couldn't respond as quickly 
or as precisely as a person could where 

3348
02:20:00,881 --> 02:20:01,420
there was options.
Google car,

3349
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:03,080
car trolls.
The shitty option.

3350
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:05,180
I'm done with engines,
bro.

3351
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:07,850
I'm like living right now.
I like this right now.

3352
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:09,830
Oh yeah.
I think we get to enjoy this.

3353
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:12,140
Well,
allegedly I took that car up to 1:40.

3354
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:13,640
Oh,
allegedlY.

3355
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:14,720
That's scary.
Fast.

3356
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:17,270
That's like,
that's a wheel fall off fast feeling.

3357
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:22,360
No.
Well it's interesting because I'm 

3358
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:22,360
allegedly.
I also took my old saab up to $100.

3359
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:23,600
It was shaking.
Yeah.

3360
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:25,180
This one was clean.
It's big difference,

3361
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:27,440
man.
Those japanese engineers,

3362
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,960
they're not fucking playing games.
We're not playing around.

3363
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:35,580
There's a.
Have you ever seen that one crazy lexis 

3364
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:36,440
that they held the ls lf lfo?
Lfo.

3365
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:38,720
Elephants lfa and say yeah,
jesus,

3366
02:20:39,220 --> 02:20:44,220
they had one and um,
when I went to vegas to get my car 

3367
02:20:44,220 --> 02:20:47,291
serviced,
they have one in the showroom and I was 

3368
02:20:47,291 --> 02:20:47,291
just like a half a million dollars.
Yeah,

3369
02:20:47,291 --> 02:20:47,291
it's,
yeah,

3370
02:20:47,291 --> 02:20:48,980
I think they stopped making them though 
and they only had a certain amount.

3371
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:51,260
Yeah,
I think they made like $300.

3372
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:53,050
How much was it?
300.

3373
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:58,060
I think it's super duper expensive,
but it was just weird that it was like 

3374
02:20:58,060 --> 02:21:01,990
performance wise,
it wasn't really much better than a 

3375
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:04,130
nissan gtr if better at all that she saw
something where they raised those two,

3376
02:21:04,131 --> 02:21:05,840
I think.
And it was pretty comparable.

3377
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:08,120
Yeah.
Gtr is a $100,000

3378
02:21:08,121 --> 02:21:11,480
car and it's a monster and that's 
another same coin.

3379
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:16,840
That's an insane piece of engineering 
and it's also something that apparently 

3380
02:21:16,840 --> 02:21:16,880
nissan doesn't really even make any 
money on it.

3381
02:21:16,881 --> 02:21:19,460
They just wanted to prove a point.
It's really kind of a country move.

3382
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:22,910
They're like put out a better car,
cheaper and like deal with it.

3383
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:24,530
They're like,
your prices are way too high.

3384
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:27,140
We're going to bring them down like good
luck for rory.

3385
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:29,420
How much is that thing?
$300,000

3386
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:30,590
to come up with that number.

3387
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:32,060
I want to know how they come up with 
that number,

3388
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:33,710
how much it costs.
You ever seen it?

3389
02:21:33,711 --> 02:21:35,960
Ferrari factory does.
They're artisans.

3390
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:41,170
They're big difference between like a 
ferrari and a like just if you're going 

3391
02:21:41,931 --> 02:21:46,931
to buy a ferrari,
you're going to buy something that's 

3392
02:21:46,931 --> 02:21:47,330
made by craftsmen like the leather 
stitching.

3393
02:21:47,331 --> 02:21:52,331
The dash has done by hand.
The car's engines pieced together by a 

3394
02:21:52,331 --> 02:21:53,960
bunch of specialists.
TheY all do it in this gigantic,

3395
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:59,230
beautiful,
clean warehouse where they eat espresso 

3396
02:21:59,230 --> 02:22:02,200
at lunch and take two hour naps and 
these are like artists and they put 

3397
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:02,750
together these,
these machines that are.

3398
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:05,810
They're not just beautiful and not just 
like perfect engineering,

3399
02:22:05,811 --> 02:22:10,811
but it sounded.
They can construct it like there's just 

3400
02:22:10,811 --> 02:22:14,491
like a feeling to them like,
like if you're into watches and he pick 

3401
02:22:14,491 --> 02:22:18,081
up a rolex and feel the automatic timer 
and know that someone like put all that 

3402
02:22:18,081 --> 02:22:21,611
shit together,
there's something to mechanical things 

3403
02:22:21,611 --> 02:22:24,880
that are created by the human hand that 
makes him like really special to us and 

3404
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:25,980
you don't really get that with the gtr.
You do.

3405
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,990
I mean it is designed by man and put 
together.

3406
02:22:27,991 --> 02:22:32,991
But what you get,
it's like this feeling of this crazy 

3407
02:22:32,991 --> 02:22:33,900
technological marvel like you get in it 
and you feel like,

3408
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:35,680
you know the lights come on though.
The,

3409
02:22:35,681 --> 02:22:36,270
the,
the,

3410
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:37,440
the,
the engine revs up.

3411
02:22:37,441 --> 02:22:40,920
You hear the turbines like whoa.
Like this is a fucking spaceship.

3412
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:42,180
This thing is a,
some,

3413
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:46,390
some crazy piece of the most advanced 
automobile technology available,

3414
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:51,590
but it doesn't feel like an old ferrari.
Like if you started up and he had a bomb

3415
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:58,520
and you realize some of the italian 
dudes built this thing and stitch these 

3416
02:22:58,520 --> 02:22:59,140
seats together by hand.
You know when you pull the seatbelt,

3417
02:22:59,141 --> 02:23:00,810
it's all.
Someone made all this shit.

3418
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,240
You know,
you feel that leather steering wheel and

3419
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:08,260
like everything's mechanical and moving 
the shifter and hearing the clickety 

3420
02:23:08,641 --> 02:23:10,200
clack.
There's something about like,

3421
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:14,040
man created things that in my opinion is
like,

3422
02:23:14,390 --> 02:23:18,510
it's like art in a physical form that's 
functional and that you use,

3423
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:20,400
you know,
and there's this.

3424
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:22,060
Whenever someone tells me like,
oh,

3425
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:23,880
don't even like cars.
You know,

3426
02:23:23,881 --> 02:23:28,881
cars are stupid to me.
A car's just gets you where you want to 

3427
02:23:28,881 --> 02:23:28,881
go.
Okay.

3428
02:23:28,881 --> 02:23:32,091
Have you ever driven a shelby mustang?
Do you even know what the fuck you're 

3429
02:23:32,091 --> 02:23:32,091
talking about?
You,

3430
02:23:32,091 --> 02:23:33,210
you don't,
you don't like that feeling when you hit

3431
02:23:33,211 --> 02:23:38,211
the gas and you hear and feel those 
fucking tires squeaking a little bit 

3432
02:23:38,211 --> 02:23:39,810
because they're trying to get some 
traction because there's so much fucking

3433
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:40,350
horsepower

3434
02:23:40,930 --> 02:23:42,310
then you're not alive,
man.

3435
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:43,870
You're not alive.
You really need a prius.

3436
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:46,330
You got to try that one.
So at least it's a good feeling.

3437
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:48,310
It is a good feeling.
Amazing.

3438
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:51,250
Especially when you do standard because 
then you really feel like you're part of

3439
02:23:51,251 --> 02:23:53,230
the car.
That I'll make that lexis so standard.

3440
02:23:53,530 --> 02:23:58,530
Even though the wall that I can bring it
in and I can actually do up and down 

3441
02:23:58,530 --> 02:23:58,930
with the shifter,
but it's not the same because you know,

3442
02:23:58,931 --> 02:24:03,931
you don't have the feet.
That's like being a little kid in high 

3443
02:24:03,931 --> 02:24:05,851
school.
It does not drive a stick shift and you 

3444
02:24:05,851 --> 02:24:07,590
pretending to shifting the gears and 
your role and exactly what it is and it 

3445
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:12,330
won't even actually there's a,
there's things put in place where you 

3446
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:12,330
can't,
it'll,

3447
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:12,330
it'll,
it'll,

3448
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:14,620
um,
gear up even if you don't.

3449
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:16,540
Because if you could take it to a 
certain point.

3450
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:18,010
So it's not really real.
Yeah.

3451
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:19,390
Yeah.
It's bullshit.

3452
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:21,040
It's bullshit.
My m three has that.

3453
02:24:21,041 --> 02:24:22,340
They have a doubles watch.
Yeah.

3454
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:24,510
It's nice and it's great for traffic.
Sure.

3455
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:25,050
You know,
and it's,

3456
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:26,640
it,
it's way more efficient

3457
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:31,680
than you would ever be with a clutch.
So clutch is kind of stupid in the long 

3458
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:32,530
run,
but this is that mechanical feeling.

3459
02:24:32,531 --> 02:24:34,810
Again,
the thing of shifting your own gears and

3460
02:24:34,811 --> 02:24:35,950
turning on,
stealing,

3461
02:24:35,980 --> 02:24:38,660
steering wheel,
there's a thrill to that that like,

3462
02:24:38,950 --> 02:24:41,620
it feels good.
It's not even about speeding,

3463
02:24:41,890 --> 02:24:46,890
you know,
like have you ever driven one of those 

3464
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:46,930
really old porsches and I was like 19 
seventies,

3465
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:48,190
like 69,
70,

3466
02:24:48,191 --> 02:24:53,191
71.
It was really tiny little mechanical 

3467
02:24:53,191 --> 02:24:53,191
things.
they have the engine in the back.

3468
02:24:53,191 --> 02:24:55,000
It's all screwy.
It hit too much gas.

3469
02:24:55,001 --> 02:24:57,610
He goes side with,
but they only have like 150 horsepower.

3470
02:24:57,611 --> 02:24:59,410
They're not heavy.
The reallY light,

3471
02:24:59,650 --> 02:25:02,200
but you feel everything in that thing 
and you get out.

3472
02:25:02,201 --> 02:25:07,201
Even if you're going 40 miles an hour,
you get out of the car with a big smile 

3473
02:25:07,201 --> 02:25:07,201
on your face.
Like that was fucking cool.

3474
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:09,580
There's some,
we've lost something.

3475
02:25:09,581 --> 02:25:14,581
It takes a lot more to get us to that 
feeling in like some crazy technological

3476
02:25:14,681 --> 02:25:15,670
marvel like alexa.

3477
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:16,230
Yes.
Yeah.

3478
02:25:16,231 --> 02:25:18,540
I think it's more like you're,
you feel lIke you're,

3479
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:20,240
you're actually doing something in the 
cars,

3480
02:25:20,250 --> 02:25:21,990
not just driving for you.
You know what I mean?

3481
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:22,740
Yeah.
You're,

3482
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:23,910
yeah,
exactly.

3483
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:25,660
Moving it along this car.
I mean,

3484
02:25:25,661 --> 02:25:28,610
I don't even know what someone's buttons
do and they're just like,

3485
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:31,450
yeah.
When you find out about traction control

3486
02:25:31,451 --> 02:25:33,520
and stability control and like they 
literally,

3487
02:25:33,521 --> 02:25:35,560
they're going around a corner.
If one wheel starts spinning,

3488
02:25:35,561 --> 02:25:38,140
they'll hit,
they'll apply brakes to it and like only

3489
02:25:38,141 --> 02:25:42,100
break one wheel and turned the car this 
way to try to balance it out.

3490
02:25:42,101 --> 02:25:44,290
It'll turn you out a fishtails yeah,
it's amazing.

3491
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:47,140
Especially that gtr gtr is incredible 
for that.

3492
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,770
Like all the guys who review it,
they,

3493
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:54,790
you know,
they'll joke around about taking on a 

3494
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:54,790
race track,
just trying to throw it into the corners

3495
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:56,380
and the car just figures out how to do 
it and corrects itself.

3496
02:25:56,860 --> 02:26:00,340
Which is really smart.
You don't want some asshole in some 1970

3497
02:26:00,341 --> 02:26:05,341
porsche.
That's gonna fucking kick out sideways 

3498
02:26:05,341 --> 02:26:07,801
on him.
EverY time he goes around a corner and 

3499
02:26:07,801 --> 02:26:07,801
gives it the gas.
You don't want that.

3500
02:26:07,801 --> 02:26:11,130
You want that asshole to drive the gtr.
But then in order for him to get his 

3501
02:26:11,130 --> 02:26:12,220
asshole kicks,
he's got to go a lot faster.

3502
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:14,950
You got to go a lot faster.
One 40,

3503
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,780
you've got to hit that gas,
feel,

3504
02:26:16,781 --> 02:26:17,980
that fucking thing.

3505
02:26:21,810 --> 02:26:24,340
Oh,
I just had my.

3506
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:26,950
I'm leaving my car out here because it 
kind of sticks out there,

3507
02:26:26,951 --> 02:26:31,951
you know,
so I drive my roommate's car and it's 

3508
02:26:31,951 --> 02:26:31,951
just such a treat to get back here and 
drive this thing.

3509
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,340
What kind of cars?
I thought,

3510
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:37,960
oh my roommates or my room as his was 
like a corolla.

3511
02:26:37,961 --> 02:26:40,360
I'm like a 92.
I think somewhere around there.

3512
02:26:40,490 --> 02:26:45,490
You don't want to drive his fucking car 
while I do out there because it's 

3513
02:26:45,490 --> 02:26:46,300
getting a push.
They do that in Mexico.

3514
02:26:46,750 --> 02:26:47,350
Mexico.
Yeah.

3515
02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:50,230
That's a good move because I don't want 
to attract attention to that.

3516
02:26:50,470 --> 02:26:51,250
Yeah.
Oh,

3517
02:26:51,251 --> 02:26:53,200
I see what you're saying.
I thought you meant like here and.

3518
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:54,280
yeah.
I was like,

3519
02:26:54,310 --> 02:26:55,930
hmm.
People love my scars here.

3520
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:56,980
No,
here is fine.

3521
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:58,480
Yeah,
I'm in Mexico.

3522
02:26:58,481 --> 02:27:00,970
Like if you have like a mercedes or you 
a target.

3523
02:27:01,130 --> 02:27:06,130
Yeah,
I think they say the guy that was 

3524
02:27:06,130 --> 02:27:06,130
helping me move in,
like the landlord was like,

3525
02:27:06,130 --> 02:27:06,460
hey,
you can take your car here.

3526
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:07,450
There's,
there's mercedes.

3527
02:27:07,460 --> 02:27:10,120
And so he's such a.
I saw like one mercedes in the garage.

3528
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:15,140
And was he sweating?
The one who's just fucking would be 

3529
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:15,140
looking around the corner.
Look,

3530
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:16,900
I'm looked at everyone's stairs 
whenever,

3531
02:27:16,930 --> 02:27:21,930
wherever I go in Mexico.
So I would just imagine how it would be 

3532
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:25,030
if they saw a spaceship.
So how often do you go out?

3533
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:26,770
You said you don't really leave the 
resort.

3534
02:27:26,860 --> 02:27:29,320
How often do you mean grocery?
Grocery shopping.

3535
02:27:29,321 --> 02:27:29,780
Like,
oh,

3536
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:31,360
you want to leave to go grocery 
shopping,

3537
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:34,120
but that's just highway and then grocery
store and then highway back.

3538
02:27:34,121 --> 02:27:39,121
It's not that bad to go there and 
there's dudes with arrows and machine 

3539
02:27:39,121 --> 02:27:39,121
guns and shit and.
Oh yeah,

3540
02:27:39,121 --> 02:27:42,811
they have w.
There's guys with machine guns all over 

3541
02:27:42,811 --> 02:27:42,811
the place.
The police?

3542
02:27:42,811 --> 02:27:42,811
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

3543
02:27:42,811 --> 02:27:42,970
they just carry around machine.
I was like,

3544
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:43,660
it's no big deal.

3545
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:45,890
It's crazy.
That is different.

3546
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:47,650
Would be the case?
No,

3547
02:27:47,710 --> 02:27:50,170
they clamPed down a bit.
From what I understand.

3548
02:27:50,210 --> 02:27:51,760
Um,
it's more of a,

3549
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,910
it's more police now than it was a 
little while ago.

3550
02:27:55,510 --> 02:27:57,580
Well,
like when I first started going,

3551
02:27:57,630 --> 02:28:02,630
the first time I went to Mexico I think 
was pre 2000 I think.

3552
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:05,080
I think I might've went.
No,

3553
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:10,260
it was when I was on mtv,
I was on this thing for fear factor and 

3554
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:11,350
we did it,
so it must have been like 2001 or 2002.

3555
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:13,290
It was pretty much safe.
Yeah,

3556
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:14,560
it's pretty normal.
It's pretty safe.

3557
02:28:14,561 --> 02:28:16,890
I think a lot of the things that they 
show here,

3558
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:19,300
just like the worst of the worst and 
it's like you can find that anywhere.

3559
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,240
Right.
You know,

3560
02:28:20,490 --> 02:28:21,800
look,
there's murders here too.

3561
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:23,030
You know what I mean?
It's just,

3562
02:28:23,031 --> 02:28:24,620
they're not publicized as much as they 
are.

3563
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:29,800
It's hard to get the video.
The video of those guys put out with 

3564
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:33,431
their fucking crazy narco music over it.
When I show people getting machine gun 

3565
02:28:33,431 --> 02:28:33,431
shit,
they have that.

3566
02:28:33,431 --> 02:28:37,760
oh,
there's some videos of them chopping 

3567
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,450
people up with chainsaws.
yeah,

3568
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:40,980
they've done a really mean shit.
It's really not.

3569
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,470
That's not,
that's not very nice.

3570
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:47,620
Yeah.
We got to figure out how to fix that 

3571
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:49,271
problem.
Everybody's worrIed about Iraq and 

3572
02:28:49,271 --> 02:28:51,161
Afghanistan.
We live next to one of the craziest 

3573
02:28:51,161 --> 02:28:51,161
spots on earth.
Look,

3574
02:28:51,161 --> 02:28:51,260
they can't get clean water,
man.

3575
02:28:51,410 --> 02:28:53,810
It's crazy.
We got to go out and refill our water.

3576
02:28:53,811 --> 02:28:57,620
We can't use the water in the sink.
Really can do the mexicans use it.

3577
02:28:57,860 --> 02:29:02,860
Yeah,
but you get sick for a long time if you 

3578
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:02,860
do it,
but eventually you get used to it,

3579
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:05,150
which I mean develops a good bacteria.

3580
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:07,310
It goes back to that fecal transplants.
Shit.

3581
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:10,310
Well you need to do is get a mexican 
dude shit and your butt and uh,

3582
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:13,850
his fecal matter will balance out your 
ecosystem.

3583
02:29:14,690 --> 02:29:16,430
I'll look into that.
That's a real thing,

3584
02:29:16,431 --> 02:29:17,900
man.
When we were talking about earlier,

3585
02:29:17,950 --> 02:29:18,390
yeah,
I,

3586
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:23,480
I actually googled it and it's called a,
they call it fecal microbiota 

3587
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:28,390
transplantation,
also known as a stool transplants 

3588
02:29:28,390 --> 02:29:31,541
process of transporting fecal bacteria 
from a healthy individual into a 

3589
02:29:31,541 --> 02:29:34,940
recipient as a treatment for patients 
suffering for them from a cdi,

3590
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:40,360
which is a,
which produces effects ranging from 

3591
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:42,330
diarrhea to a pseudo membrane.
Ious colitis.

3592
02:29:42,890 --> 02:29:45,230
Colitis is not good.
Anytime someone says he got colitis.

3593
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:50,030
Previous terms for the procedure include
fecal bacteriotherapy,

3594
02:29:50,031 --> 02:29:52,040
fecal transfusion.
Fecal transplant,

3595
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:54,020
huh?
Wow.

3596
02:29:54,230 --> 02:29:59,230
They wIll involve restoration of the 
colonic flora by introducing healtHy 

3597
02:30:00,591 --> 02:30:04,370
bacterial flora through an infusion of 
stool.

3598
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:05,750
People just eat better.

3599
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Well,
the fact that someone came up with this 

3600
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:11,000
idea,
yeah,

3601
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:11,000
who,
who,

3602
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:11,870
someone's pretty mixed in there one day 
and just saying,

3603
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:14,360
I wonder if we can put poop in someone 
else's buttons,

3604
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:16,160
fix their.
Well,

3605
02:30:16,161 --> 02:30:21,161
they're starting to understand so much 
more when it comes to bacteria and 

3606
02:30:21,161 --> 02:30:22,850
healthy bacteria and they're starting to
understand that it,

3607
02:30:22,910 --> 02:30:25,310
it affects mood.
It's affects behavior,

3608
02:30:25,311 --> 02:30:30,311
it affects so much and it wards off 
diseases and improves your immune system

3609
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:36,070
and actually some bacteria aggressively 
fights off colds and aggressively fights

3610
02:30:37,071 --> 02:30:40,040
off when you come into contact with a 
certain different,

3611
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:45,360
you know,
nasty things that they can actually be 

3612
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:45,780
like having troops and your body does.
Don't,

3613
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:48,530
don't viruses just mutate and come back 
stronger though.

3614
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:49,270
Well,
they couldn't.

3615
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:52,520
If you don't take your fucking men's do 
all 10 days.

3616
02:30:52,610 --> 02:30:57,610
If you're one of those bitches like doug
stanhope who openly admitted on the 

3617
02:30:57,610 --> 02:31:01,361
podcast that he contributed to the 
creation of a super aids by not taking 

3618
02:31:01,361 --> 02:31:03,120
his fucking full z-pak.
Yeah.

3619
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:04,670
He's one of those dudes.
I have felt better.

3620
02:31:04,671 --> 02:31:08,240
I stopped tagging it.
So,

3621
02:31:08,241 --> 02:31:10,290
uh,
so if somebody tries to tell you that,

3622
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:15,320
that they took that your shit is so good
that you took it out and put it in 

3623
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:17,620
someone's body and it healed them,
you know,

3624
02:31:17,690 --> 02:31:20,010
the guy might not be lying.
Sounds like

3625
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,350
he'd be a bullshit artist that does 
sound,

3626
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:25,800
no pun intended.
So,

3627
02:31:25,801 --> 02:31:29,420
um,
how did you get involved with being a,

3628
02:31:29,470 --> 02:31:33,990
like a sort of an expert on positive 
thinking or mental concentration?

3629
02:31:33,991 --> 02:31:36,570
Or did you just get it by experimenting 
yourself?

3630
02:31:36,571 --> 02:31:41,220
And tHen I met someone in a poker game a
while ago in la.

3631
02:31:41,221 --> 02:31:43,740
We were running a poker in la.
Was it already should fear?

3632
02:31:43,910 --> 02:31:48,910
No,
and a guy's kind of taken me under his 

3633
02:31:48,910 --> 02:31:52,701
wing,
kind of taught me the ways of life 

3634
02:31:52,701 --> 02:31:52,701
really.
How much gay sex is involved in a lot.

3635
02:31:52,701 --> 02:31:54,390
A lot.
It seems.

3636
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:57,600
It seems like you've just given none.
No.

3637
02:31:57,710 --> 02:31:58,470
Um,
you know,

3638
02:31:58,560 --> 02:31:59,480
it's,
it's been,

3639
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:02,100
it's just something I've always known in
my life.

3640
02:32:02,101 --> 02:32:03,780
Just there's,
there's something I got to learn,

3641
02:32:03,781 --> 02:32:05,850
you know,
I got to learn about myself.

3642
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:08,760
I got to learn how to think,
how to feel,

3643
02:32:08,761 --> 02:32:10,800
how to,
how to just be man.

3644
02:32:10,801 --> 02:32:13,320
I mean there was a lot of time,
like for example,

3645
02:32:13,321 --> 02:32:18,321
with women,
I would not talk to a woman for till I 

3646
02:32:18,321 --> 02:32:22,261
college.
I was scared of rejection and one day I 

3647
02:32:22,261 --> 02:32:22,261
choose the music.
Brian.

3648
02:32:22,261 --> 02:32:22,261
Yeah.

3649
02:32:23,650 --> 02:32:25,620
We're gonna.
We're gonna.

3650
02:32:25,621 --> 02:32:27,270
Need you to repeat this story?
Okay.

3651
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:34,850
So what you were saying basically that 
there was one really big breakup.

3652
02:32:36,990 --> 02:32:39,780
Yes.
It's one really big,

3653
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:44,370
crazy heart wrenching breakup.
It wasn't really that big though.

3654
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:45,810
Okay.
For the story.

3655
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:46,580
Okay.
For this store.

3656
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:47,250
Oh,
that's right.

3657
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:52,280
For the hulk music while I'm trying to 
stall while brian pulls up the hold 

3658
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:53,040
music.
the internet here sucks it.

3659
02:32:53,330 --> 02:32:54,330
Hmm.
Shocker.

3660
02:32:55,390 --> 02:32:56,560
Anyway,
go ahead and tell us your story.

3661
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:58,080
No,
look,

3662
02:32:58,170 --> 02:33:03,170
I wouldn't even go up to a woman because
I was scared of rejection and one day I 

3663
02:33:03,170 --> 02:33:03,170
was sitting there,
I was like,

3664
02:33:03,170 --> 02:33:04,880
why am I scared of this rejection?
And I thought to myself like,

3665
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:08,670
if I don't go up,
it's a no right every time.

3666
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:11,730
And if you just close your eyes and jerk
off in the bathroom,

3667
02:33:11,731 --> 02:33:16,731
it's a yes every time.
It's like you pretended to actually 

3668
02:33:16,731 --> 02:33:18,180
happen and then you can talk to where 
without needing something,

3669
02:33:18,181 --> 02:33:23,181
without being such a needy bitch,
and you probably wind up being more 

3670
02:33:23,181 --> 02:33:23,181
successful.

3671
02:33:23,181 --> 02:33:23,820
Well look,
that's one of the things I've learned is

3672
02:33:23,821 --> 02:33:28,821
like everything is created By yourself.
You're as confident as you believe you 

3673
02:33:28,821 --> 02:33:29,940
can be as weak as you believe you are.
I saw your twitter.

3674
02:33:29,941 --> 02:33:31,030
It was really funny.
Yeah,

3675
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:33,030
I do.
Um,

3676
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:37,920
text message you the wrong person.
And so he,

3677
02:33:37,921 --> 02:33:39,210
uh,
he text messaged me,

3678
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:44,300
hey,
you got the wrong number and this is 

3679
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:44,300
matt and hey,
by the way,

3680
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:44,300
girls don't like it when you need it.
Exactly.

3681
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:44,920
Well,
he texted,

3682
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:50,240
he texted me three times within an hour 
and I was sitting there playing poker 

3683
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:50,240
and I was just like,
man,

3684
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:51,390
stop annoying me.
And I was like,

3685
02:33:51,391 --> 02:33:52,110
you know what?
No,

3686
02:33:52,111 --> 02:33:54,070
I'm just going to help this guy out.
Listen,

3687
02:33:54,390 --> 02:33:59,390
you cannot text the girl three times.
She's done with you after the second 

3688
02:33:59,390 --> 02:33:59,580
text probably.
Yeah.

3689
02:33:59,610 --> 02:34:01,680
Even the second text you've given up 
your cards,

3690
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:02,910
you know,
what are you doing?

3691
02:34:02,930 --> 02:34:05,880
But unless you're just having fun and 
not have to worry about anything,

3692
02:34:05,881 --> 02:34:08,100
you're not actually playing a game of 
trying to catch the pussy.

3693
02:34:08,170 --> 02:34:09,080
Yeah.
You know,

3694
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:11,520
if you could be friends and you could 
send three text to a friend.

3695
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:16,640
Sure.
But let's be realistic trying to get 

3696
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:17,830
some blue cards.
It's the same as poker.

3697
02:34:17,831 --> 02:34:19,270
Right?
You get crazy.

3698
02:34:19,271 --> 02:34:21,010
You throw all your money on the table 
and you're fucked.

3699
02:34:21,300 --> 02:34:23,080
Yeah.
Requires discipline.

3700
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:23,830
Well,
in the big,

3701
02:34:23,890 --> 02:34:25,600
in the beginning I went broke three 
times.

3702
02:34:26,230 --> 02:34:27,910
Broke,
like sucking dicks on the street.

3703
02:34:27,911 --> 02:34:28,500
No,
well,

3704
02:34:28,530 --> 02:34:31,090
I mean I was still living with my 
parents so it wasn't that bad.

3705
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:35,350
But you were living with your parents 
and he went broke.

3706
02:34:35,570 --> 02:34:35,890
No,
no,

3707
02:34:35,891 --> 02:34:36,640
no.
I mean,

3708
02:34:37,210 --> 02:34:37,780
wait,
hold on.

3709
02:34:37,781 --> 02:34:39,310
Let me think about.
It is a long time ago.

3710
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:41,800
If you'Re going to make up a story,
have it made up.

3711
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:45,040
Okay.
I don't want to hear you crazy.

3712
02:34:45,041 --> 02:34:50,041
Fake going broke with your parents.
I went broke when I was in college in 

3713
02:34:50,041 --> 02:34:50,410
college,
so like when I was in,

3714
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:55,540
I went to plattsburgh,
upstate New York and I went broke like 

3715
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:57,510
three times during that period I went 
broke with my student loan first.

3716
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:59,500
Oh jesus.
So like,

3717
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:04,860
and then I,
I made six grand back and I went to 

3718
02:35:04,860 --> 02:35:06,220
vegas and I made,
I made some money,

3719
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:10,540
but I was like trying to be that cool 
guy going to clubs and spending all this

3720
02:35:10,541 --> 02:35:15,541
money and I went home with like 200 
bucks every time I went broke I 

3721
02:35:15,541 --> 02:35:17,870
rebounded within a week and I got back.
I had a 9,000

3722
02:35:17,890 --> 02:35:18,590
score.
Right.

3723
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:22,300
So you have been addicted to playing 
poker for a long fucking time.

3724
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:27,450
You're talking about like,
I wouldn't say dictate the wrong 

3725
02:35:27,450 --> 02:35:27,450
terminology.
You been,

3726
02:35:27,460 --> 02:35:29,900
uh,
an extreme enthusiasts of,

3727
02:35:29,950 --> 02:35:31,090
of competitive poker.

3728
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:31,510
Yeah.
Well,

3729
02:35:31,511 --> 02:35:34,660
the way it went was the first year I 
learned how to play.

3730
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:37,810
I was playing eight hours a day,
seven days a week.

3731
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:43,250
You just got obsessed.
That's the way I am when I do something 

3732
02:35:43,250 --> 02:35:43,250
and I really put my mind to it.
I want to be the best.

3733
02:35:43,250 --> 02:35:44,560
There's just no stopping.
So,

3734
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:49,620
and it,
with poker it's much like with a lot of 

3735
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:52,591
other disciplines,
there's so much you can learn that it 

3736
02:35:52,591 --> 02:35:55,201
becomes really exciting.
Like the more you know more effort and 

3737
02:35:55,201 --> 02:35:55,201
focus,
you Put on it,

3738
02:35:55,201 --> 02:35:59,711
the more you read about it,
the more you improve and you see that 

3739
02:35:59,711 --> 02:35:59,711
improvement.
It's very stimulating,

3740
02:35:59,711 --> 02:36:00,340
you know,
it is.

3741
02:36:00,341 --> 02:36:02,080
And,
and the great thing about poker,

3742
02:36:02,081 --> 02:36:06,220
the I love is it's always new,
new things always.

3743
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:08,320
You can pick up something new every time
you play.

3744
02:36:08,590 --> 02:36:13,590
And that's why I love it because it 
keeps me learning new things every day 

3745
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:14,740
and,
and growing as a poker player,

3746
02:36:14,741 --> 02:36:15,910
you know,
as a personal that stuff.

3747
02:36:16,030 --> 02:36:18,300
Well it seems like it'd be a fun way to 
make a living too,

3748
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:23,320
as long as you're actually successful.
But that one year you said you had like 

3749
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:25,650
one year they did it last year.
Data a soccer bag one.

3750
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:26,250
Yeah.
Well,

3751
02:36:26,251 --> 02:36:31,251
most of the reason was because I lost my
online income because of the black 

3752
02:36:31,251 --> 02:36:32,770
friday poker being coming illegal so I 
couldn't play on line,

3753
02:36:32,771 --> 02:36:34,290
so I was just spending money without 
making it.

3754
02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:36,820
So.
Is that why you moved to Mexico?

3755
02:36:37,690 --> 02:36:38,360
partially,
yeah.

3756
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:39,850
Make more money.
Do you find yourself a little.

3757
02:36:39,851 --> 02:36:44,851
Can you read it down there that knows 
how to speak spanish and get you out of 

3758
02:36:44,851 --> 02:36:44,851
a jam?
No,

3759
02:36:44,851 --> 02:36:45,370
no,
I haven't.

3760
02:36:45,371 --> 02:36:47,050
I don't.
I can't speak spanish at all.

3761
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:48,880
You live in,
in spanish,

3762
02:36:48,881 --> 02:36:51,970
you can't speak spanish.
Most of them are part of the problem.

3763
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,340
Most of the big restaUrants and stuFf 
speak english,

3764
02:36:54,341 --> 02:36:56,380
so I never really had the better.
We're right next door.

3765
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:58,510
We've got the Cash.
Exactly.

3766
02:36:58,540 --> 02:37:00,310
You got the guns now.
They got the guns now.

3767
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:03,140
We sold them a lot of guns.
A lot of guns.

3768
02:37:03,210 --> 02:37:04,990
Man.
That was one of the dumbest ideas in the

3769
02:37:04,991 --> 02:37:08,590
history of the human race.
Was that operation fast and furious.

3770
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:11,300
You know,
that is when the dea decided to.

3771
02:37:11,470 --> 02:37:13,960
We've got to find out where there's 
mexicans do with these guns,

3772
02:37:13,990 --> 02:37:15,620
sell them a bunch of guns,
track them.

3773
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:18,470
So they sold them like thousands of 
guns.

3774
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:20,480
Scroll the operation fast and furious.
Yeah,

3775
02:37:20,481 --> 02:37:25,481
it's a real.
And then some of those guns were 

3776
02:37:25,481 --> 02:37:27,911
actually used to kill a us border patrol
agent like that is easily one of the 

3777
02:37:28,730 --> 02:37:33,640
dumbest ideas in the history of the.
Or one of the most clever ruses for.

3778
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:35,270
Oh,
I was just so stupid.

3779
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:38,480
I didn't even know you can't sell guns.
Whips.

3780
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:39,710
Sorry.
I won't happen again.

3781
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:41,280
I was actually working for the good 
guys.

3782
02:37:41,281 --> 02:37:43,430
And now selling the bad guys guns.
Yeah,

3783
02:37:43,431 --> 02:37:45,920
I figured we'd Just watch who they shoot
and then we have them.

3784
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:48,920
You get it.
We have about 2000 guns over there.

3785
02:37:48,930 --> 02:37:53,930
No worries.
It's no big deal in guns are illegal 

3786
02:37:53,930 --> 02:37:54,020
over there in Mexico.
All guns?

3787
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:56,840
No.
We'll illegal to own as as a citizen.

3788
02:37:56,980 --> 02:37:59,300
Like what about rifles?
Like hunting rifles.

3789
02:37:59,500 --> 02:38:00,560
I don't know about that.

3790
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:02,600
I think that would be a gun,
right?

3791
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:04,550
I mean that's stupid.
How are you supposed to kill your food?

3792
02:38:04,820 --> 02:38:07,100
You don't have to.
Everybody has to rely on someone else to

3793
02:38:07,101 --> 02:38:09,500
kill it for them.
Apparently beans are already dead,

3794
02:38:09,501 --> 02:38:11,120
bro.
They're alive.

3795
02:38:11,121 --> 02:38:13,820
You got to pick them,
bitch trying to out there.

3796
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:16,160
MaYbe you do.
But um,

3797
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:16,600
yeah,
it's,

3798
02:38:16,601 --> 02:38:18,170
it's,
it's real interesting living out there,

3799
02:38:18,171 --> 02:38:18,560
man.
It's,

3800
02:38:18,561 --> 02:38:23,561
it's a new world.
So You moved there just to specifically 

3801
02:38:23,561 --> 02:38:23,561
to get around this law?
Yeah.

3802
02:38:23,890 --> 02:38:25,460
ARe you in trouble like saying that?
Can you say.

3803
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,940
Oh no,
no,

3804
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:26,270
no,
no.

3805
02:38:26,271 --> 02:38:27,480
It's legal to play there.
Oh,

3806
02:38:27,510 --> 02:38:27,890
it is?
Yeah.

3807
02:38:27,891 --> 02:38:29,510
It's legal.
Is it legal?

3808
02:38:29,650 --> 02:38:32,060
So you can say,
like if someone says,

3809
02:38:32,061 --> 02:38:33,560
hey,
Why are you living in Mexico?

3810
02:38:33,561 --> 02:38:34,250
You can say,
look,

3811
02:38:34,251 --> 02:38:36,440
I'm a professional poker player.
That's how I make my living.

3812
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:39,050
You paid taxes in America on those ill 
gotten gains.

3813
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:40,220
Yeah.
That's illegal.

3814
02:38:40,430 --> 02:38:42,020
And how is that not illegal?
It's,

3815
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:47,380
I don't know.
It's where the actual house that you 

3816
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:48,170
sleep in is settled in.
that's what's important.

3817
02:38:48,171 --> 02:38:50,020
What line of the dirt isn't on?
yup.

3818
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:51,680
if it's on here,
you can go to jail.

3819
02:38:51,681 --> 02:38:53,450
If it's on here,
they'll take your tax dollars.

3820
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:58,510
That's how it is.
You get shit for going back and forth 

3821
02:38:58,510 --> 02:38:58,510
like the border guys look at you.
Funny.

3822
02:38:58,590 --> 02:39:00,890
Not really.
I mean I just say them there to surf and

3823
02:39:00,891 --> 02:39:01,970
relaxed.
Which is true.

3824
02:39:03,230 --> 02:39:04,800
Do you sit?
Does it say that you're a,

3825
02:39:06,130 --> 02:39:08,430
that you live like on you looking at 
your passport,

3826
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:09,870
does it say you live in Mexico?
No,

3827
02:39:10,050 --> 02:39:11,520
a United States passport.
Yeah.

3828
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:17,140
So what do you say?
Just say I have a vacation home down 

3829
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:17,140
there.
I just say vacationing.

3830
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:17,780
Yeah.
And you know,

3831
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:20,790
it's not really a deal,
a big deal when you come into the us,

3832
02:39:20,840 --> 02:39:22,970
but when you go into Mexico you don't 
want to say that.

3833
02:39:23,030 --> 02:39:24,980
What's the deal with Canada?
Can you do that in Canada?

3834
02:39:25,010 --> 02:39:25,980
You could do in Canada.
Yeah.

3835
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:27,910
You chose Mexico or Canada?
Yeah,

3836
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:30,590
like the beach dude.
True.

3837
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:33,270
That's true.
I guess dc.

3838
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:38,320
Those photos of a.
Kevin perry was in cabo and then photos 

3839
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:40,250
he sent either tweeting.
It's just looks so beautiful.

3840
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:42,920
So gorgeous.
It was fucking gorgeous.

3841
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:48,070
however you might get shot Canada.
Canadians are way nicer.

3842
02:39:49,250 --> 02:39:50,060
Yeah,
absolutely.

3843
02:39:50,061 --> 02:39:51,230
I thought about it,
you know,

3844
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:56,260
but I just want to go somewhere and make
a bunch of money and come back and live 

3845
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:56,260
now.
Do you,

3846
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:57,230
when you have a professional poker 
player,

3847
02:39:57,231 --> 02:39:59,200
like what's the longterm goal?
Do you like?

3848
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:04,240
You try to be the best,
try to like stockpile enough money away 

3849
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:04,240
so that you can get through a bad year.
Yeah,

3850
02:40:05,090 --> 02:40:05,600
yeah.
Well,

3851
02:40:05,630 --> 02:40:07,400
for example,
I bought a house last year,

3852
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:08,630
you know,
um,

3853
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:13,720
I just try to,
I have some money with a financial 

3854
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:13,720
advisor.
I have some money in my bank,

3855
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:14,550
you know,
I just try to diversify

3856
02:40:14,580 --> 02:40:16,830
because there are going to be rainy days
where you don't make money.

3857
02:40:17,100 --> 02:40:18,570
so,
you know,

3858
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:21,990
I was fortunate that I was able to make 
enough to not have to really worry about

3859
02:40:21,991 --> 02:40:24,170
it when black friday hit and you know,
I could,

3860
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:29,300
I could live.
it's funny that eVerybody calls it in 

3861
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:29,300
the poker community friday,
black friday,

3862
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:29,860
black friday.
Is there,

3863
02:40:29,950 --> 02:40:31,560
is there any work being done and try to 
fix that.

3864
02:40:31,561 --> 02:40:33,480
Yeah,
that's going on I would say about a year

3865
02:40:33,481 --> 02:40:35,510
until it's legalized.
But the problem lies,

3866
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:39,420
the problem now is that they want to do 
it state to state where you're not gonna

3867
02:40:39,421 --> 02:40:41,550
be able to play with the whole world.
So you're going to have.

3868
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:43,740
It's not going to be able to make as 
much money as you could,

3869
02:40:44,090 --> 02:40:45,910
you know,
just to play against californians.

3870
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:48,960
But that's the job bitches.
That's true.

3871
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:50,450
That's true.
On a,

3872
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:54,180
on sunday they have a $200 buy in,
which gets about 4,000

3873
02:40:54,181 --> 02:40:54,600
players.

3874
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:56,400
You can win a quarter of a million 
dollars.

3875
02:40:56,910 --> 02:40:58,080
Where's this?
It's online.

3876
02:40:58,770 --> 02:40:59,940
Jesus.
pokerstars.

3877
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:01,740
And you can't play it if you live in 
America.

3878
02:41:01,770 --> 02:41:02,550
Correct.
To try to go.

3879
02:41:02,670 --> 02:41:07,350
Could you go through a proxy or as you 
could but then like a pierogi but not as

3880
02:41:07,351 --> 02:41:07,950
tasty.
You could.

3881
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:09,300
Yeah,
you could.

3882
02:41:09,301 --> 02:41:10,340
But I wouldn't say.
I mean,

3883
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:11,780
I wouldn't suggest it,
you know,

3884
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,830
because if they catch you,
I don't know what they would do.

3885
02:41:14,970 --> 02:41:16,170
So it probably arrest you.
Right?

3886
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:17,430
I don't know.
Well that's what I said.

3887
02:41:17,431 --> 02:41:22,431
The law with poker is it's so new that 
they don't really have anything set in 

3888
02:41:22,431 --> 02:41:22,800
place.
So they could probably take your money.

3889
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:24,420
Probably.
Isn't that funny?

3890
02:41:24,421 --> 02:41:26,010
They can't take it.
If you do it in Mexico,

3891
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:28,500
even though you're paying them the taxes
on that.

3892
02:41:28,501 --> 02:41:30,660
If you do that,
that's one of the worst part of it.

3893
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:33,000
Please is that,
well finally they just remedy this,

3894
02:41:33,001 --> 02:41:35,490
but for a bunch of years you couldn't 
carry over losses.

3895
02:41:35,490 --> 02:41:40,490
So let's say you made 100 k one year,
but then the next year he lost 40 and 

3896
02:41:40,490 --> 02:41:40,490
they're not giving you any of the 100 
back.

3897
02:41:40,950 --> 02:41:44,250
So it's hard to survive sometimes.
Will that just makes sense.

3898
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,950
I mean it's just based on a yearly 
thing.

3899
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:48,660
Yeah.
Do you think that you'd be able to.

3900
02:41:48,870 --> 02:41:50,070
Well,
because like for example,

3901
02:41:50,071 --> 02:41:52,890
if you're a doctor you're making around 
the same each year,

3902
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:55,290
but if you're a poker player you can 
lose some,

3903
02:41:55,291 --> 02:41:56,740
some urine,
you know,

3904
02:41:56,860 --> 02:41:59,310
now you can carry over though.
They let you now carry over.

3905
02:41:59,430 --> 02:42:01,590
Oh,
you do now you can as the last.

3906
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:03,270
Within the last year I believe.
Oh,

3907
02:42:03,271 --> 02:42:08,271
that's interesting.
I should say I was told this by 

3908
02:42:08,271 --> 02:42:11,181
somebody,
the same guy that told brian that 

3909
02:42:11,181 --> 02:42:11,520
dolphins have,
but no,

3910
02:42:11,521 --> 02:42:16,521
this was a cpa,
so I'm hoping it's right or else I'm 

3911
02:42:16,521 --> 02:42:16,521
screwed.
He's a producer.

3912
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:18,930
There are distributors of 
disinformation.

3913
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:21,870
Make sure you check.
Yeah,

3914
02:42:22,050 --> 02:42:23,630
I should check the same.
You never know man.

3915
02:42:23,690 --> 02:42:24,960
You're right.
It might be fucking with you.

3916
02:42:25,070 --> 02:42:26,130
It's true.
Next thing you know,

3917
02:42:26,131 --> 02:42:28,650
you're trying to claim some shit and 
he's trying to get you locked up.

3918
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:33,950
Maybe he's deep inside.
He's working from the inside like that 

3919
02:42:33,950 --> 02:42:34,170
show homeland and I'm talking about.
I haven't seen it yet.

3920
02:42:34,171 --> 02:42:36,810
I've been told to watch that though.
It's good man.

3921
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:37,980
So,
um,

3922
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:41,390
you said you worked with camp men and 
you work with commonly?

3923
02:42:41,630 --> 02:42:46,630
Yes.
You work with conference last five 

3924
02:42:46,630 --> 02:42:46,630
franklin.
So.

3925
02:42:46,630 --> 02:42:47,640
Well actually I worked with him for his 
last fight before that,

3926
02:42:47,790 --> 02:42:51,030
against more extensively for the other 
fight.

3927
02:42:51,031 --> 02:42:53,080
We talked once.
Oh,

3928
02:42:53,300 --> 02:42:58,300
so we didn't.
It's sort of like still in its infancy 

3929
02:42:58,300 --> 02:43:00,501
stages.
Are you planning on doing this as a 

3930
02:43:00,501 --> 02:43:00,501
business?
I want to know what would you do?

3931
02:43:00,501 --> 02:43:05,301
Just make different programs based on 
different guys and how just play it by 

3932
02:43:05,911 --> 02:43:08,670
ear and try to figure out how what we 
can do to fix them.

3933
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:09,240
Yeah,
I mean,

3934
02:43:09,241 --> 02:43:10,160
well,
the thing is,

3935
02:43:10,350 --> 02:43:11,980
like I said,
it differs so much from person

3936
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,160
to person so you can have kind of an 
idea of where you're going,

3937
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:20,190
but how you get there is going to be 
different based on everybody else and 

3938
02:43:20,190 --> 02:43:20,190
what they're.
What's going on in their head.

3939
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:21,010
That's pretty cool,
dude.

3940
02:43:21,011 --> 02:43:26,011
You know,
you're obviously a guy who's a sort of 

3941
02:43:26,011 --> 02:43:27,310
figured out in life that you can carve 
your own path.

3942
02:43:27,420 --> 02:43:28,090
You know,
you don't have.

3943
02:43:28,091 --> 02:43:30,820
You're not living,
you're living in fucking Mexico.

3944
02:43:30,821 --> 02:43:35,821
First of all,
that's be a big hand professional poker 

3945
02:43:35,821 --> 02:43:36,490
player and I'm just going to go mentally
coach fighters.

3946
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:37,300
Yeah.
Well,

3947
02:43:37,301 --> 02:43:39,940
I mean that's,
that's the fun way to live life I think.

3948
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:40,780
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

3949
02:43:40,781 --> 02:43:45,781
Without a doubt.
I think it's so important for people to 

3950
02:43:45,781 --> 02:43:48,151
hear that people like you are doing that
too because so many people think that 

3951
02:43:48,151 --> 02:43:52,231
life is just this sort of mundane series
of events that you've been thrown into 

3952
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:57,630
and there's no way to get out of it and 
you're going to be stuck doing 

3953
02:43:57,630 --> 02:43:57,630
something.

3954
02:43:57,630 --> 02:43:57,630
This,
You know,

3955
02:43:57,630 --> 02:43:58,180
along these lines for the rest of your 
life.

3956
02:43:58,210 --> 02:44:01,120
Like you can do anything you want,
and I know it sounds corny,

3957
02:44:01,150 --> 02:44:03,940
but one day I literally woke up and 
said,

3958
02:44:03,941 --> 02:44:05,000
you know what?
I want to work with them.

3959
02:44:05,001 --> 02:44:06,850
May flyers and I,
and I Took action.

3960
02:44:06,980 --> 02:44:07,710
You know,
that's the best.

3961
02:44:07,711 --> 02:44:09,550
The one thing I think that most people 
are lacking.

3962
02:44:09,551 --> 02:44:11,380
They can think of great things they want
to do,

3963
02:44:11,381 --> 02:44:16,381
but as far as action goes,
a lot of people are waiting for someone 

3964
02:44:16,381 --> 02:44:17,890
else to come along and help them.
You know?

3965
02:44:17,891 --> 02:44:21,520
That's why it's one of the most annoying
things I bet you must get this,

3966
02:44:21,521 --> 02:44:26,521
is people that have requests for you to 
help them start a business or requests 

3967
02:44:26,521 --> 02:44:28,240
for you to help them.
Do you get that kInd of investor?

3968
02:44:28,241 --> 02:44:31,090
You mean as an investor?
I've been burned a couple of times.

3969
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:32,710
I don't do it anymore.
You can't.

3970
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:34,600
You've got to figure out your own pants 
on,

3971
02:44:34,660 --> 02:44:36,070
you know,
and coming up to someone and say,

3972
02:44:36,071 --> 02:44:41,071
listen,
if you took this and brought it to a 

3973
02:44:41,071 --> 02:44:41,071
producer,
like,

3974
02:44:41,071 --> 02:44:41,071
ah,
I got my own things to worry about.

3975
02:44:41,071 --> 02:44:42,250
You've got to find your own way.
Don't,

3976
02:44:42,280 --> 02:44:47,280
don't try to get a bunch of people to 
fucking make your business by donating 

3977
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:50,821
money and stop fap.
You need to set up a structure that you 

3978
02:44:50,821 --> 02:44:52,120
need to just set up a structure for how 
you're going to get to where you want to

3979
02:44:52,121 --> 02:44:53,650
get,
and that's the only way to do it.

3980
02:44:53,950 --> 02:44:56,290
There's a lot of fucking people that 
want other people to help them.

3981
02:44:56,950 --> 02:44:59,560
I get requests like that.
Can you teach me how to play poker?

3982
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:02,130
That seems easy.
It's like,

3983
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:05,320
do you realize how much time it takes to
get good at poker?

3984
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:06,340
I asked them that.
I say,

3985
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:09,520
do you understand that you're going to 
have to be completely immersed in it for

3986
02:45:09,521 --> 02:45:11,500
a year or two.
Can you do that with your time?

3987
02:45:12,340 --> 02:45:13,480
Eight hours a day?
Good luck,

3988
02:45:13,481 --> 02:45:14,620
and if you don't,
you're gonna lose.

3989
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:16,780
Exactly.
So he never be a fucking professional.

3990
02:45:16,781 --> 02:45:18,790
God dammit.
It's verY important though,

3991
02:45:18,810 --> 02:45:23,680
do to have guys like you to have a 
conversation with someone who's living a

3992
02:45:23,681 --> 02:45:26,410
life that seems like a crazy life.
Like you know,

3993
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:27,250
like,
wow,

3994
02:45:27,251 --> 02:45:29,350
that guy figured that out.
How that to do that,

3995
02:45:29,650 --> 02:45:33,880
it's so important for normal folks too.
To hear stuff like your story.

3996
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:39,060
Like if I was 18 and I heard your story,
it would be great for me because I'd be 

3997
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:39,060
like,
oh,

3998
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:40,860
okay,
well that's possible too.

3999
02:45:41,090 --> 02:45:43,120
Like maybe you don't have to do this 
job.

4000
02:45:43,121 --> 02:45:45,370
Like maybe I should figure out if I 
could be a poker player.

4001
02:45:45,370 --> 02:45:46,870
That guy seems cool.
He's having a good time.

4002
02:45:47,140 --> 02:45:52,140
Like just the idea.
Just put the idea of you being able to 

4003
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:54,670
accomplish things that are unusual.
Things you don't see around you.

4004
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:58,220
It's not easy.
It takes work and that's why most people

4005
02:45:58,221 --> 02:46:00,820
I don't think do it because it takes a 
lot of work,

4006
02:46:00,821 --> 02:46:03,040
man.
It takes a lot of work to do anything to

4007
02:46:03,041 --> 02:46:08,041
do any of you to be an mma fighter,
to be a poker player and anything and 

4008
02:46:08,051 --> 02:46:10,310
everything.
That's sort of the key to life.

4009
02:46:10,311 --> 02:46:14,030
Find something that you really love to 
do and just go fucking crazy with it

4010
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:19,160
and the key is to not be stopped because
you're going to hit road bumps and some 

4011
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:19,160
people will just say,
okay,

4012
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:19,950
well I'll try something new,
but you know,

4013
02:46:19,951 --> 02:46:21,840
I hit road bumps in poker too when I'm 
broke,

4014
02:46:21,841 --> 02:46:22,740
you know,
you didn't.

4015
02:46:22,830 --> 02:46:26,000
I thought about quitting every time,
you know,

4016
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:27,660
and I just said,
you know what,

4017
02:46:27,720 --> 02:46:30,300
I'm just going to get better.
And I actually with the way I did it was

4018
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:33,540
I messages the top 10 ranked poker 
players online.

4019
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:35,430
That's how I did it.
I said,

4020
02:46:35,431 --> 02:46:37,380
listen,
I'm looking to get good.

4021
02:46:37,770 --> 02:46:39,810
Will you take five minutes out of your 
day to talk to me?

4022
02:46:40,220 --> 02:46:41,430
And three of them said,
yes,

4023
02:46:41,940 --> 02:46:43,710
those are suckers.
Those guys screwed up.

4024
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:46,650
Sudden let this guy in nice take all 
your fucking money.

4025
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:48,460
What have you come in second place in 
you,

4026
02:46:48,480 --> 02:46:49,890
you,
you come in first place.

4027
02:46:49,891 --> 02:46:51,480
And he comes in second and he's like,
what the fuck?

4028
02:46:51,510 --> 02:46:56,510
Yeah,
you certainly can't do it with a large 

4029
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:58,101
group of people,
but I definitely try to take like three 

4030
02:46:58,101 --> 02:46:58,101
or four people under my wing,
you know,

4031
02:46:58,101 --> 02:46:58,101
at a time.
That's cool man.

4032
02:46:58,101 --> 02:47:00,380
I think it's important to know brian 
under your wing.

4033
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:03,020
I've been life cooked so much this week 
from sore.

4034
02:47:03,021 --> 02:47:03,570
I can't even say.

4035
02:47:06,330 --> 02:47:09,150
And with that,
ladies and gentlemen,

4036
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:10,620
thanks.
Once again.

4037
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:11,040
Anybody

4038
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:13,250
who bought my special,
my comedy special online,

4039
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:16,220
if you go to joe rogan.net
live from the tabernacle,

4040
02:47:16,460 --> 02:47:21,460
I couldn't come up with another name.
I was trying to figure out what another 

4041
02:47:21,460 --> 02:47:24,220
name would be,
but it just never came to me and I 

4042
02:47:24,220 --> 02:47:25,150
didn't think it was important.
So it's live from the tabernacle because

4043
02:47:25,220 --> 02:47:29,060
I filmed it at the tabernacle theater in
atlanta,

4044
02:47:29,061 --> 02:47:30,340
Georgia.
And uh,

4045
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:35,860
I think you could play this music.
It distracts me and it makes me 

4046
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:39,311
confused.
I don't know what to do a lie from the 

4047
02:47:39,311 --> 02:47:41,120
tabernacles available drm free.
That means you could download it.

4048
02:47:41,121 --> 02:47:42,200
You can put it on whatever the fuck you 
want.

4049
02:47:42,201 --> 02:47:44,510
You can copy it,
you can put it on your watch tv.

4050
02:47:44,511 --> 02:47:49,511
Watch on an ipad,
there's a bunch of different downloads 

4051
02:47:49,511 --> 02:47:49,511
you can get to.
You can also stream it.

4052
02:47:49,511 --> 02:47:53,201
There's a lot of different options 
available you can buy with paypal or 

4053
02:47:53,201 --> 02:47:53,201
amazon.

4054
02:47:53,201 --> 02:47:56,860
It's only five bucks a louis c,
k style louis I think really sort of 

4055
02:47:56,860 --> 02:48:01,151
changed the entire way the comedians are
going to be distributing their shows in 

4056
02:48:01,161 --> 02:48:03,170
the future to self promote it and self 
funded.

4057
02:48:03,171 --> 02:48:06,290
And that's what I did.
I paid for the entire filming of it all.

4058
02:48:06,590 --> 02:48:09,020
Um,
hired like a real director and my friend

4059
02:48:09,021 --> 02:48:14,021
anthony and his big company,
positive image video to do a great 

4060
02:48:14,021 --> 02:48:14,960
professional job on it.
So I'm really proud of it.

4061
02:48:14,961 --> 02:48:19,961
It's a,
I think it's my favorite stuff of all 

4062
02:48:19,961 --> 02:48:19,961
the stuff that I've ever done and it's 
really exciting.

4063
02:48:19,961 --> 02:48:20,450
Um,
it's a,

4064
02:48:20,451 --> 02:48:23,720
an awesome time to be a comedian and I'm
a in my um,

4065
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:27,290
my uh,
replenishing material phase right now.

4066
02:48:27,291 --> 02:48:32,291
So it's a really exciting.
I'm doing a lot of sets and having so 

4067
02:48:32,291 --> 02:48:33,560
much fun coming up with new shit.
But the feedback's been amazing.

4068
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:38,510
It's been the most positive feedback of 
anything I've ever done online ever.

4069
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:43,720
So I just want to thank you guys and 
thanks to everybody that sends all the 

4070
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:45,710
cool tweets and the facebook messages 
and all that shit.

4071
02:48:45,711 --> 02:48:50,711
I appreciate the fuck out of all,
but I can't thank everybody 

4072
02:48:50,711 --> 02:48:50,711
individually.
One at a time.

4073
02:48:50,711 --> 02:48:53,570
But we know that you guys are enjoying 
this show.

4074
02:48:53,571 --> 02:48:58,571
We know that you guys are enjoying the 
standuP shows and all the other shit 

4075
02:48:58,571 --> 02:48:59,450
that we do and we're very happy and 
we're gonna keep doing it.

4076
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:03,920
If you want to follow matt online,
you could follow him.

4077
02:49:03,921 --> 02:49:08,790
He is on twitter and uh,
his twitter handle is matt.

4078
02:49:08,850 --> 02:49:13,850
Then grin v e n g e r I n.
So it's m,

4079
02:49:13,921 --> 02:49:16,730
a t t e v e n g r I n d

4080
02:49:16,770 --> 02:49:19,410
what website do I do?
But I hardly use it,

4081
02:49:19,411 --> 02:49:21,660
but I would like to plug a charity book 
I made.

4082
02:49:21,810 --> 02:49:23,670
Okay.
It's called poker with a purpose.

4083
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:27,570
It's on amazon.
did you do that just to get checks?

4084
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:29,340
no.
Say I do charity poker,

4085
02:49:29,341 --> 02:49:30,090
you know,
but I.

4086
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:35,120
But I did.
I did give 100 percent of it to our 

4087
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:35,170
charity.
I didn't tell you.

4088
02:49:35,180 --> 02:49:36,520
That's beautiful.
That's all we got,

4089
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:38,110
20 of the best poker players in the 
world,

4090
02:49:38,111 --> 02:49:39,420
the writing it.
so that's cool.

4091
02:49:39,450 --> 02:49:41,330
Yeah.
And is it an instructional loaders?

4092
02:49:41,331 --> 02:49:42,870
Yeah,
so basically there's,

4093
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:44,280
the way I did it was,
um,

4094
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:47,550
I did uh,
like different facets of the game,

4095
02:49:47,730 --> 02:49:52,730
like I'm three betting you probably 
won't understand the terms with three 

4096
02:49:52,730 --> 02:49:55,740
different things of poker and I did 
three people to do their opinion on it.

4097
02:49:55,741 --> 02:49:58,580
So you could choose whIch one you like 
or incorporate whatever you like into.

4098
02:49:58,710 --> 02:50:00,240
Mostly it's just one person writing 
about it,

4099
02:50:00,241 --> 02:50:01,470
like they know it to be fact.

4100
02:50:01,550 --> 02:50:02,180
Oh,
that's cool.

4101
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:03,980
Yeah.
And so all these different people put it

4102
02:50:03,981 --> 02:50:05,330
out and it's available

4103
02:50:05,430 --> 02:50:09,030
through amazon and it's just um,
since we were given this to.

4104
02:50:09,031 --> 02:50:14,031
I'm a green world.org
where they plant trees all throughout 

4105
02:50:14,031 --> 02:50:14,031
the world.
Um,

4106
02:50:14,031 --> 02:50:15,370
