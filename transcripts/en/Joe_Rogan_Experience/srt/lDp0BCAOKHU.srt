1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello,
freaky bitches.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,450
No guy rule.
I can't bring guys over now guys.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,920
I know sometimes it sounds like a sugar
daddy thing.

4
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,170
I had to strip,
right use the day.

5
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:11,880
She had a sugar daddy and she would just
buy them all a pile of shit,

6
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,060
which is great because I didn't have to
buy it and then I got that appointment.

7
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,571
I go,
you know what?

8
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,530
Maybe he should start getting me some
shit because I'm like,

9
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:18,750
Nigga out,
he's trying to fuck her.

10
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,440
Obviously.
Sudden I'm like,

11
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,990
well do I remember it was a VCR.
I'm like,

12
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:24,340
well get me a VCR because I don't want
to put up with their shit.

13
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,860
Meanwhile,
and then she'd come home with a VCR.

14
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,110
It's like I need to feed clr.
I'm like,

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,790
beautiful.
I actually went on a date with them in a

16
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:34,110
limo and pretend that I was the guy
friend and bad mouth myself for an hour

17
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:34,800
in front of this guy.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,060
You that boyfriend of hers?
Like A.

19
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,110
Yeah,
he's a real dick.

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,500
Oh my God.
And we went to a mall and I picked out

21
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,510
like,
like 20 cds he bought me and I think he

22
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,760
bought me like a,
I forget it was like a Walkman at the

23
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,730
time or something like that.
I'm like,

24
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:46,201
yeah,
I'll take one.

25
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:46,711
And I'd be like,
sure.

26
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:49,890
You seem like a good dude.
Just fucking bad.

27
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:52,590
My Mike and the guys holding her hand in
the limo and I'm just sitting there like

28
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,730
the friend of my.
I don't give a shit.

29
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,230
I'm getting cds,
strong pimp move.

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,030
I tried to get a TV but he wasn't going
forward.

31
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,510
I see a lot of these guys,
the rocket like this,

32
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,510
the reason why they have two is because
of prostitution laws.

33
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,740
If prostitution was legal,
there's a lot of these older,

34
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,330
creepy dudes that are just out there
trying to make it happen.

35
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,520
It just tough action,
you know,

36
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:22,240
unless you're paying for it.
Very tough to get someone love you for

37
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,100
who you are.
Like if you had these really high

38
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:25,970
standards and your gross,
yeah.

39
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,710
But if you've got a ton of cash and
prostitution's legal,

40
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,040
if they just made prostitution legal in
America,

41
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,500
you'd have exactly the same amount of
hose.

42
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,540
Okay.
Exactly the same.

43
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,420
Listen to me,
they're not gonna know.

44
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,760
More people are not going to be hoes.
Hoes are hoes are ready.

45
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,690
They're just doing it in weird ways.
And maybe it'd be better.

46
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,710
Prostitution was legal.
So you found out exactly who the

47
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,160
tax it will pay.
Exactly.

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,470
Amazon one click stuff.
Nothing wrong with it.

49
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,080
It's just sex.
Is it okay to go get a massage?

50
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,030
Yes.
It's okay to pay someone to suck your

51
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:04,110
Dick.
It just is.

52
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,850
Yes,
it should be.

53
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,040
You know.
And these guys shouldn't have to move

54
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,240
these fucking girls biocar.

55
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,200
That's rude by the guy.
Friends.

56
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,700
Vcrs.
I shouldn't have to do it.

57
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:17,540
I felt bad just he's trying.
Figured he's trying to bang my check so

58
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,250
at least I should get some gifts out of
it.

59
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,070
Now.
How did you wind up ending this whole

60
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:23,290
relationship?
You know,

61
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,520
it was a stripper.
So it was just.

62
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,120
I mean with him,
I got

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,180
him out of your life.
It seems like he would want some return

64
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:34,400
for his investments.
He was doing what he was juggling,

65
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,260
like three different ones and he just
never.

66
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,800
I think he was fucking won,
but he wanted the fuck all three of

67
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,210
course.
And my chick had boundaries

68
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,790
while she said,
well,

69
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,860
I wasn't around.
She said she was no way.

70
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,860
I'm not going to sleep with them,
but that's true.

71
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,360
But he bought her tickets to.
She wanted me to buy her textbook for a

72
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:50,720
brand.

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,980
I'm like,
find your tits.

74
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,690
And he bought her tits,
tits.

75
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,750
Holy Shit.
Did you.

76
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:58,220
Did you guys go to dinner with this guy?
Just.

77
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,830
Yeah,
we went to dinner that just that night.

78
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:03,400
I only met him that one time I'd be at
the Bardo because you know the sugar

79
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,480
daddy always comes into strip club and
sits there and all the girls come out.

80
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:09,010
I was right across the bar just sitting
there just watching this guy.

81
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,270
I'm like,
I'm fucking that tonight.

82
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,870
Keep giving her money.
She take a meter to diner.

83
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,590
She's taking me to dinner later with
that money.

84
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,780
Okay.
You're the guy.

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,030
When the always people always talk about
Alec Strippers,

86
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,160
crazy boyfriends.
That's you.

87
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,720
Yeah,
the central one,

88
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,040
and I was like cutting lawns at the
time.

89
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,970
I was making like eight bucks an hour
and this guy said this guy is probably

90
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,620
like 300 grand a year.

91
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,240
He just created a.
well,

92
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,310
first of all,
Coen brothers movies are my ultimate

93
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,760
favorite movies of all time.
Like when I saw Donald Trump was running

94
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,950
for president the other day,
I said,

95
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:42,550
we live in a Cohen brothers movie.
It's official because his fucking Slob,

96
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,780
this goofy Slob is going to run his ego
just pouring out of his ears.

97
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:48,040
He ever met him.
No.

98
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,590
Weird dude.
And I'm sure we met him.

99
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:53,860
We did something on top gear where we
were trying to convince him to like pick

100
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,640
one of these cars that we had each pick
for the celebrity and we found out like

101
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,020
halfway through,
it's for Donald Trump.

102
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,350
And he basically was like,
uh,

103
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,970
this guy looks gay.
He's looking at tanner.

104
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,320
He's like,
I think this car,

105
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,860
you look gay.
So the car's probably for a gay person

106
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,070
and whatever tailored.
I don't remember what kind of car he had

107
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:12,670
picked potatoes.

108
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,710
Like what?
What did y'all tell?

109
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,240
Did you tell Donald Trump to make fun of
me?

110
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,074
That I look like.
I'm mean,

111
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,150
that's just what he does.
I just,

112
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,640
he just went for it and then he was
like,

113
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,180
oh,
I'll take yours.

114
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,700
Was He trying to be funny?
I think he was,

115
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,200
but he's one of those people that I
don't think he can hear other people.

116
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,150
I think maybe he can read lips a tiny
bit,

117
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,750
but like he walks into the room and all
you do is you look at his hair,

118
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,584
man,
you can't.

119
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,820
There is nothing an asteroid hit the
earth next door and you'd still be like,

120
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:44,470
man,
what's going on up there to that?

121
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,930
Like how do you get up every day?
And you say,

122
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,060
yeah,
this is the look like.

123
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,300
Those are the kinds of people that I see
in like his wife,

124
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,400
a malaria,
malaria,

125
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,150
malaria,
some of them,

126
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,760
whatever her name is,
Larry Them.

127
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,660
That's one of those girls that I would
look at her and then look at him and

128
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:04,180
think,
there's no way you guys have ever had a

129
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,400
conversation,
right?

130
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,310
No.
You look at her,

131
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,650
you look at him and you go,
do you know Tom Arnold?

132
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,460
Is He did what you're doing when he did
it with a woman.

133
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,840
Right?
I see what you're doing.

134
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,550
I get ya.
It's all right.

135
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,593
Hey,
look.

136
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,520
It's better that than working at
Wendy's.

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,740
If these are your odds.
It's true.

138
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,990
What do you want to do?
Do you get Donald Trump's dick or get a

139
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,340
lot of money?
Do you get the free frosties cheats on

140
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,910
you did well.
I did.

141
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,571
Well,
Donald,

142
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,130
I got to give you that with your wacky
here.

143
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,160
If you're into that.
If you're in a what?

144
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,023
Tens?
Yeah.

145
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,880
Who's into that?
Who's in a hot chicks mouth shut.

146
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,810
I'm always thinking.

147
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,180
I was really thinking for her,
like if you're really into.

148
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,230
Oh,
she's not into that.

149
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,390
I don't know.
She's probably pilled up.

150
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,390
She'd probably just like stays on the
steady oxycontin.

151
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,420
Drip throughout the entire day.
Just stays mellow and weird.

152
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,050
Look at the gelatinous facial thing he's
got going on too,

153
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,790
was thrilled with the chandlers rolls
into his neck.

154
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,040
Colors is really interesting in that
hair too.

155
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,350
I'm telling you,
I hope you meet him.

156
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:04,310
Just I,
I hope not necessarily that you need

157
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,440
them,
but just that you're in in your life.

158
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,110
You end up in the same room and just
test my theory.

159
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,490
I honestly,
I couldn't look away.

160
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,780
Well the moment if I did meet him,
the moment he gets Dickie,

161
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,850
I go,
I will grab your fucking hair.

162
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,330
I'm just telling you ran down there and
then we'll find out what's going on.

163
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,620
So you might want to shut the fuck up.

164
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,610
What are you gonna do you gonna beat me
up?

165
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,490
Call security.
I Bet I'd get your hair before security

166
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,350
gets here.
I Bet I get to your fucking hair.

167
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,600
Dude.
Don't get picky with me.

168
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,680
Just the lead in this.
I don't touch her hair in the later

169
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,480
stages of my life or whatever where I'm
at.

170
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,310
I don't have any patience for people
like that.

171
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,980
Just don't have any desire.
I get it.

172
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,340
Like,
uh,

173
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,600
you know,
that's the reason why he's so

174
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:47,450
successful,
but you don't get to be a super fucking

175
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:50,000
billionaire.
Real estate mogul has his name on every

176
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,320
building dot trump towers.
Right?

177
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,260
You don't get that unless you have that
sort of an attitude.

178
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:56,390
So I guess I understand.
Stay there history,

179
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:59,280
put us up there once for the upfronts.
And uh,

180
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,960
I opened the little like mini bar and
his face was on the vodka

181
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,150
for me.

182
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,310
I was like,
this feels like too much bro.

183
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,800
It's just,
I feel like you gotta draw the line

184
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,420
somewhere
or you just go for it.

185
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,640
It would just go for it.
If you just keep going like the further

186
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:20,630
and deeper you go into the crazy ego,
swimming pool becomes like warmer water

187
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,660
because like it gets better is that he
can be like the Walt Disney of total

188
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,060
douche bag real estate moguls.
Is that

189
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,050
it?
It felt like Disney world.

190
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,510
I couldn't escape his face.
He's kept steaks.

191
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,130
Trump steaks.
Look above that.

192
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:40,550
JV.
I think those are made from a manatees.

193
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,530
I asked him,
I asked him,

194
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,500
I met Joe.
He's kind of,

195
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,690
I don't know,
I'll be honest with you.

196
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,040
John,
have a chip on his shoulder.

197
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,470
He was angry and stuff,
you know what I mean?

198
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,790
Uh,
he won't mind me telling you this

199
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,700
because they just don't beat meal.
And um,

200
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,080
he,
yeah,

201
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:03,080
he was an,
it was a bit like that and I seen him at

202
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,570
k one because I did k one in Los Angeles
while ago.

203
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,190
I was talking to him.
I said,

204
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,080
Yo,
miles bad then what you come across on

205
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,630
the Internet,
you're much better person than what you

206
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,690
act.
I can kind of still come with them.

207
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,850
They made me a friend on facebook and
then that concept and said,

208
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,100
do you want me to work with you anyway?
Yeah,

209
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,260
she'll cool.
And then we got on.

210
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,930
He's so smart.
He picks things up so quickly.

211
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,330
He's so open to stuff.
Um,

212
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,550
we've done some really,
really cool stuff.

213
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,480
That's I,
I can experiment on Joe,

214
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,870
if,
if that makes sense.

215
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,580
You know,
some things that I want to try.

216
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,030
I n a dude him and he seems to work
really well in him.

217
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,040
So like,
can you give us an example,

218
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,670
like what do you mean,
like things that you want to explore

219
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,270
that it's really strange but,
but he's like,

220
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,830
I had to think about because uh,
I mean lish have a gala hot date night.

221
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,370
It got to the knights of the roundtable,
king author on Joe didn't want to get

222
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,230
injured because he was going to fly,
I think he,

223
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,810
Robert something or other,
he was on glory and then he was going to

224
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:05,811
fight on ballots or against Melbourne.
Not have any way to come out on scathed.

225
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,450
So we persuaded his unconscious mind.

226
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,480
So I've armor likes the Gullah hat.
So I talked and Gnosis about the

227
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,940
archetype of Knights,
of the Knights,

228
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:22,941
of the round table and he will a heart,
not literally obviously,

229
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,180
but you know,
so we had armor so he didn't come.

230
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,520
So we'd come out on injured,
you know,

231
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,790
the words.
I'm not saying it's going to work for

232
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,360
everything,
you know,

233
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,193
I'll get,
you know,

234
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,150
so he bullets and stuff like that,
you know what I mean?

235
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,380
But it was just,
it was that,

236
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,940
again,
in mindset into that,

237
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,790
into that sort of the way of thinking.
