1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,620
Hello,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,940
freak bitches to why?

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,440
Donald?

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,741
Why?

5
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:05,660
Getting off to anime?

6
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,950
Porn is shorthand for
supporting Donald Trump.

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,020
Lauren Griffin had to say the
name or worse or Sydney or Sydney.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,291
Oh,

9
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,280
this just happened to pop up.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,080
But what a bizarre fucking title.

11
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,411
Okay,

12
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:19,621
let's,

13
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,790
let's see what she has to say.

14
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,510
God dammit.

15
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,880
Forbes continue.

16
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,773
Please.

17
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,480
Yeah,

18
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,111
it's hilarious.

19
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:26,340
On Tuesday evening,

20
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,310
gop consultant Rick Wilson made twitter,

21
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,320
but the waves with look at that,

22
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,510
they have the fucking stock
of twitter right there,

23
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,100
plus zero,

24
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,060
50 percent,

25
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,560
zero point 50 percent in that hilarious.

26
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,050
They showed twitter and then they have
people reading Forbes while will just

27
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,590
stalk at the stock
number right next to it.

28
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,380
So weird waves with his claim that donald
trump's supporters are mostly single

29
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,740
men who masturbate to Adam.

30
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,710
He's a gop consultant too.

31
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,810
I think they're right with,

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,260
uh,

33
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,180
this is unintentionally
incendiary statement that
Wilson says he made directly

34
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,950
to troll trump's followers.

35
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,840
February's trolling everybody.

36
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,890
First of all,

37
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,170
as any enemy fan will let you know.

38
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,004
It's called,

39
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,620
um,

40
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,453
clears throat.

41
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,490
Hentai a specific genre of x ray
to Japanese animated cartoons.

42
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,180
But what's interesting is that in order
to intentionally make people angry,

43
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,090
Wilson targeted anime Geeks as his insult.

44
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:24,460
Okay.

45
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,670
I don't know what this
tweet don't upset them.

46
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,151
Yeah,

47
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:27,470
they'll.

48
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,040
They'll find you reply you.

49
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,200
I don't know.

50
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,860
I can compete with I,

51
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,250
I feel strongly that's.

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,891
I'm like,

53
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:35,131
okay,

54
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,510
I can compete with the girl I've seen.

55
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,160
I can't compete with cartoons.

56
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,870
Cellulite.

57
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,230
It's,

58
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,531
it's.

59
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,930
I really don't want to have
stats on how many people have.

60
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,560
One website is convincing
people to pay for cartoon porn.

61
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,760
If you're paying for cartoon point,

62
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,540
just watch Jessica Rabbit.

63
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,020
Whoa.

64
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,853
Hold on a second.

65
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,020
Among 18 to 34 year old viewers,

66
00:01:55,021 --> 00:02:00,021
cartoon and Hentai are the 13th and
17th most popular porn searches.

67
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:05,340
And millennials are 131 percent more
likely to search for Anamae than older

68
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:06,174
browsers.

69
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,130
Whoa.

70
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,080
You just blew my mind having her feet up.

71
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,910
Or do you think it was a
sexual posturing thing?

72
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,200
I don't know if you know.

73
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,540
There's a lot of men in the room.

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm in a weird position.

75
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,500
It could just be instinct.

76
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:19,661
Yeah.

77
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,160
Look at her.

78
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,710
Look at her dudes are
staring a lot of black dudes.

79
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,330
Is that the Black Caucus?

80
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,710
Black College business leaders of the
black historically black colleges and

81
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,090
universities and look at her.

82
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,710
Do you think that that's
what's going on there?

83
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,780
I think that's very sexual.

84
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,080
I mean it looks sexual dude.

85
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,100
She's got the vagina
curtain thing going on.

86
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,360
She's got her legs spread.

87
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,230
Yeah,

88
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,100
she's looking at her phone.

89
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,370
Maybe pictures of Dicks.

90
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,080
She's actually on tinder,

91
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,621
which is weird.

92
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:50,454
Yeah.

93
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:51,870
Yeah.

94
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,130
She's swiping everyone,

95
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:53,431
right?

96
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,264
Yes.

97
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,620
Come get some.

98
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,870
There's so many great memes about this.

99
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,240
Like I saw one of them that was in quotes.

100
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,490
What is a train question mark?

101
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,820
Fantastic.

102
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,530
That's fantastic.

103
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,650
We live in a fucking
dream and we really do.

104
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,710
This is so to see donald trump's smiling
like if you like knocked me over the

105
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:21,780
head 10 years ago and put me in a coma
and then woke me up today and then.

106
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,780
And then I was like,

107
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,620
well what's going on?

108
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,453
Who's the president?

109
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:24,911
And you're like,

110
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:25,001
well,

111
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,601
check this out.

112
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,434
I'd be like,

113
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,611
get the fuck out of it.

114
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,420
Oh yeah,

115
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,660
yeah.

116
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,320
It's like you remember that scene in
back to the future when he's like,

117
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,870
who's the president in 1985?

118
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,640
Ronald Reagan,

119
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,473
the actor,

120
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,400
you know exactly what it's like.

121
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,541
It's crazy.

122
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:37,780
Yeah,

123
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,510
it's crazy.

124
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,343
It's great shirt.

125
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,390
Put that picture back up.

126
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,830
A camp.

127
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,800
So much going on there.

128
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,930
No one's ever done that before.

129
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,810
Like before this.

130
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,081
She's like,

131
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,760
we've got to do a photo with the blacks,

132
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,020
you know,

133
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,010
like the kind of things he says.

134
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,090
We got to get more images of the blacks
that with me because every time really

135
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:52,690
important,

136
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,530
really important.

137
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,590
Every time he takes a
photo into the Oval Office,

138
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,930
it's like 12 white guys.

139
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,880
Wish I could do an impression of him.

140
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,870
I mean,

141
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,230
yeah,

142
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,063
there's a lot.

143
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,060
Yeah.

144
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,050
To me it's just talk like it though.

145
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,480
I don't like.

146
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,040
My voice doesn't make that noise.

147
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,100
Like whatever noises.

148
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,943
He's his voice.

149
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,060
It's coming gravel or something.

150
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:13,661
I don't know what it is.

151
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,494
Yeah,

152
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,640
very bad things.

153
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,560
The bad debts.

154
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,380
Sad.

155
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,460
Very Sad.

156
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,420
That's sad thing.

157
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,630
It's hilarious.

158
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,990
The word sad after tweets because
fucking everybody's doing it now.

159
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,910
So funny though.

160
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,230
The Internet is funny,

161
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,064
man.

162
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,880
The Internet.

163
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,391
The Internet,

164
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:28,720
you have to,

165
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,090
like I,

166
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,130
I always look at comedy,

167
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,030
like music,

168
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,481
you know,

169
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,314
and I always say like,

170
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,430
like I know how to do,

171
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,200
I know how to play Acoustic Guitar,

172
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,040
which is stand up,

173
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,550
you know what I mean?

174
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,300
And then how to write.

175
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,260
I've written for TV shows.

176
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,190
That's like playing the piano,

177
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,571
instagram,

178
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,050
twitter,

179
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,630
like it's like that's like the
saxophone man and I'm like,

180
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,920
I'm trying to learn the music,

181
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,420
but it's funny man,

182
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:49,180
like people kind of common
and people are good at it.

183
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,430
Like some people are just
good at it and like you said,

184
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,740
you see a meme every now and then like
my girlfriend sometimes we'll be in the

185
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,500
uh,

186
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,780
you know,

187
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,770
like whatever,

188
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,520
you know,

189
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,331
in the bedroom or something.

190
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,770
And I'm here hysterically laughing and
I come in and she just shows me and I'm

191
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,200
like,

192
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,531
you know what,

193
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:03,364
that's pretty funny.

194
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,430
Just a still image with three
words on it and it just works.

195
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:06,911
Well.

196
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,220
Memes are a new form of comedy,

197
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,990
like he's images with
text attached to the end.

198
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,210
That's just so perfect.

199
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:13,571
Totally.

200
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:17,560
And there's a way to do it and there's
a way not to do it because you can't be

201
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,280
met at about it.

202
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,113
You can't be like,

203
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,961
oh,

204
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:20,740
uh,

205
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,250
you know,

206
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,900
you have to like embrace it.

207
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,070
You can't think you're above it.

208
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:24,671
Like you can't go.

209
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:24,940
Like,

210
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,510
Oh,

211
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,201
here's my me,

212
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,970
my memes about how means you're stupid.

213
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,181
It's like,

214
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:28,400
no,

215
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,060
I'm not kidding you.

216
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,920
Everybody hates you.

217
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,430
I mean,

218
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,240
I've only made one
instagram thing that I did.

219
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:34,780
Okay.

220
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,613
Which was a,

221
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,810
it was a picture of um,

222
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,100
Ivanka trump and that silver dress.

223
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,260
And I was like,

224
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,670
right when she released it,

225
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,031
I was like,

226
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:43,280
oh,

227
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,320
I gotta do something about this.

228
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,011
And I said to my girlfriend,

229
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,701
but what does this look like?

230
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,570
She's like a chipotle,

231
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,423
a Burrito.

232
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
So I found like I found a couple,

233
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,880
a burrito wrapped in tinfoil and I,

234
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,341
and I was like,

235
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,174
who wore it better?

236
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,950
It did really.

237
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,290
It was like the only time I did something
and answer instagram because a lot of

238
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,530
times I'll put a joke instagram,

239
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:57,771
I'm like,

240
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,990
get ready Internet about to break you.

241
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,980
And then nobody likes it.

242
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,013
But that one,

243
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,270
that one I actually saw other people
posting without crediting me and I was

244
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:05,391
like,

245
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:05,660
Hey,

246
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,480
what do you mean you
don't really know their

247
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,313
dresses?

248
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,190
It looks like it looks just
like she looks like a Burrito.

249
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,140
He's an odd look and fellow too.

250
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,640
There's something about the man,

251
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,310
the what does the name jared
could lay low in the beginning,

252
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,941
you know,

253
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,400
like somebody doesn't
us pick my battles dude.

254
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,900
You'd have to kill somebody immediately.

255
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,580
You have to find the first
person in your group,

256
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,340
the weakest person and kill
them in front of everybody else.

257
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,203
Yeah.

258
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,590
Like you can just stay on there.

259
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,410
Couldn't be like,

260
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,810
yeah Duh,

261
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,170
you can kill some dude.

262
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,730
But think about them and
you can't stand there.

263
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,570
And as being a comment,

264
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:38,721
you know,

265
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,760
everybody's chatting group
huddle and everybody's like,

266
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,300
you got to take somebody out right
then because that's going to show your

267
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,570
dominance 100.

268
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,640
I mean it's going at least gonna show.

269
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,740
Like this dude is going to do something.

270
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,270
I see what you're saying.

271
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,130
But I think if you think ahead,

272
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,120
you would think,

273
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,990
well no,

274
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,720
they're not going to think that he's
got arbitrarily gonna always kill the

275
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,471
weakest person.

276
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:00,410
Eventually it's going to get to know
one because there's going to be the next

277
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:00,920
week is person,

278
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,220
that guy is dead now and the next week
like who's to decide whether or not

279
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,054
you're weak or you're not weak.

280
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,470
If you were going to do that,

281
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:10,550
that person would have to be either a
terrible person who is victimizing other

282
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:10,990
people.

283
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,570
Right?

284
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,060
Or they would have to have attacked first.

285
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:15,600
You'd have to be.

286
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,220
Or they would have been such a piece of
shit that people are rooting for you.

287
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,720
Like somebody that was real
chatty and you just ask them did.

288
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,020
There's no way I'm
trying to survive like a,

289
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,173
like a,

290
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,601
you know,

291
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:30,410
the second coming of the universe
in some dudes chatty in my group,

292
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,010
bro.

293
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,843
That's not.

294
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,130
Especially if like he fucks
up some hunting parties.

295
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,680
You're out there with sneaking
up on a pig and he's like,

296
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,311
oh my God,

297
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,060
it's so hot out.

298
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,460
You fucking pig runs away.

299
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,330
And everybody's hungry.

300
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,740
Yeah.

301
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,330
Chatty with you.

302
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,080
The first man I think
about that kind of stuff,

303
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,220
like if a plane crashed,

304
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,980
I already know I'm planning ahead
did I'd eat a Vietnamese guy?

305
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,153
Why?

306
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,640
Because it's easier to start or move.

307
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,050
If you attack somebody bigger,

308
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,850
you eat somebody bigger
in front of other people.

309
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,990
It's going to alarm people,

310
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,630
but you got to eat a small person,

311
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,160
so stature is important.

312
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,720
I think if you come down a viet,

313
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,130
people aren't going to
be that upset at you.

314
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,860
Other Vietnamese people are
going to be super upset.

315
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,694
What are you talking about,

316
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,510
dad?

317
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,330
Their sacrifice.

318
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,200
They're more understanding of things,

319
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:12,630
dude,

320
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,970
this is the character you're playing.

321
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,143
No,

322
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,910
but if you eat a black dude,

323
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:18,740
you eat a black lady
and her family's there.

324
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,000
There are going to be pissed.

325
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,500
So you think at Vietnamese person,

326
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,334
we'll let you slide.

327
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,460
I think that they'd be much more
forgiving over a couple of day period.

328
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,560
I think a lot of their relatives.

329
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,700
You don't think so honestly.

330
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,713
One thing?

331
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,170
No,

332
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,920
I don't think so.

333
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,630
I definitely think that
be super pissed at you.

334
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,070
Especially modernized ones,

335
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,870
but what is interesting is like Vietnam
is one of the few places where Americans

336
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:42,650
can go back to Vietnam and they
don't seem to hold any grudge at all.

337
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,143
