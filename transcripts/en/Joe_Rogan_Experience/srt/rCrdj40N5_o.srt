00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,730
Drive by day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,043
Last couple of years you've been,
you been involved in a lot of crazy 

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:08,614
shit,
you know,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,840
what are you,
have you,

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,180
are you disappointed in yourself with a 
lot of this stuff?

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,910
I told him I totally,
um,

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,861
what does it feel like?
Like,

8
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:17,590
like,
like,

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,080
like gimme the thought.
Like we can go through all of them,

10
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,990
but give me the thought like probably 
the most,

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,630
I was disappointed in you and I love you
as a person.

12
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:26,740
I think you're a great guy.
Oh,

13
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:27,281
you too,
Joe.

14
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:28,300
Thanks.
I really do.

15
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,160
I've always had a good time hanging out 
with you,

16
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,220
but I was very disappointed with you 
with that car accident.

17
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,650
Then when you ran away from that car 
accident,

18
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,410
that to me was like,
God damn John's in a bad place.

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,971
Yeah,
it was.

20
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,230
It was,
I was at a bad place.

21
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,990
It was a,
it was a messed up situation,

22
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:43,920
man.
I literally,

23
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,150
I was an important mental life then when
I was winning all these fights,

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,553
I was the boy in the UFC.
I'm sponsored by Nike and gator aid and 

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,210
greatest of all time finishing legends 
after legend after legend.

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,780
I'm just really in this position where I
felt so untouchable and I just felt like

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,480
I just felt like everything was meant to
go my way.

28
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,950
And that that time of my life,
um,

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,550
started to,
I was obviously,

30
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,670
I was smoking pot,
you know,

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,420
majority of my career,
dre man,

32
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,360
too shy,
drank and you know,

33
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:23,130
every weekend pretty much,
you know,

34
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,370
to the point of blacking out,
just locking out.

35
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:25,950
Yeah.
Just,

36
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,270
just be at the hammer,
you know,

37
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,040
and just being a total party boy.

38
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,460
But still,
I'm still training my butt off,

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,770
you know,
I'm working really hard,

40
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,270
believing really hard,
had big goals,

41
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,250
big dreams,
but just being a party boy.

42
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,503
And I think I just took everything that 
I have for granted because everything 

43
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,420
for the majority of my career has come 
my way.

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,643
And um,
that that morning I got in a car 

45
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,381
accident,
man.

46
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,510
I just,
it was,

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,250
it was just,
it was,

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,460
it was a huge reality check and it was,
you know,

49
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,650
I think in some people's mind they,
they envisioned me,

50
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,963
you know,
hitting this car and running up and 

51
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,590
seeing that it was a pregnant lady and 
then take it off Vernon.

52
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,460
And then people said that I came back 
and grabbed a load of money,

53
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,120
which is the stupidest thing ever.
Why would a millionaire and need to grab

54
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:13,410
cash,
right.

55
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,880
Unless there's one back to the car.

56
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,950
So I literally,
I went through a light,

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,150
um,
it was like a green light that says that

58
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:24,984
I could turn left,
but he was supposed to yield for the 

59
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:29,760
right away,
right to turn left.

60
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:32,340
And um,
um,

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,593
person came through and I,
I just assumed it was my green light to 

62
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:37,500
go,
obviously being,

63
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,440
um,
not completely clear headed.

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,710
And I ended up running into a car.
Um,

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,920
I was definitely disoriented.
I'm disoriented from the accident,

66
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:50,484
from the accident for sure.
Just kind of like what the hell just 

67
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:53,550
happened.
It was a really big hit.

68
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,140
Um,
but that was fine.

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,260
I had no injuries and I just felt like,
well maybe it wasn't that bad of a hit.

70
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,080
So I literally,
um,

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,813
a step out of the car and I realized 
like seconds later and I realized my 

72
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,980
bulls in the car.
So your bowl?

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,910
My Ball,
my,

74
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,331
yeah,
my,

75
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:13,811
my,
my,

76
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,340
yeah,
my pop bought pot.

77
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,293
Yeah.
And I wasn't smoking weed in the car or 

78
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,630
anything,
but it was in the car.

79
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,120
But my bowl that had residue was in the 
car.

80
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,580
So I literally,
I opened my car door,

81
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,610
I'd like to take two steps away from the
car and then I go back to the car and I,

82
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,863
I like search the car cause I had it in 
my cup holder and when I hit the bolt 

83
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:37,090
fell somewhere.
Who knows where it flutes you.

84
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,450
But I knew I knew his shit.
Like I can't find that bull that's going

85
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:44,950
to get me in trouble,
just having a ball on my car.

86
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,173
So I looked for like two seconds,
Clinton find the ball and I just took 

87
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,040
off running.
Um,

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,790
did you look at the other person in the 
other car?

89
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,500
No,
I had no clue that it was a woman.

90
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,420
I had no clue that it was a pregnant 
woman.

91
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,180
How much time are we talking about?
Like from the time was released,

92
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,620
from the time that I hit,
I had,

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,400
I had,
I had,

94
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,460
I was over a fence probably eight 
seconds later.

95
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,680
It was,
it was literally a super reactionary,

96
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,920
like just,
I just felt I hadn't been home yet.

97
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,970
I stay at a friend's house.
I wasn't drinking and driving.

98
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,450
I,
you know,

99
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,283
my decision was to sleep at my friend's 
house because I knew I couldn't drive 

100
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,734
home.
He woke up early the next morning to go 

101
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,160
to work and he's like,
John,

102
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,570
feel free to stay here.
And,

103
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,500
uh,
you know,

104
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,120
you can make yourself breakfast or 
whatever,

105
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,550
whatever.
And I,

106
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:30,384
the guy has a family,
he has a wife and he has a newborn baby 

107
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,510
and I didn't want to stay at his house 
while he's at work,

108
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:36,010
so I was just like,
no,

109
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:36,910
I think I'm okay.

110
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,610
But really I had maybe like two hours of
sleep and,

111
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,100
um,
I didn't realize that I was still wasn't

112
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,660
ready to drive.
So,

113
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,150
um,
you know,

114
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:49,630
I wake up and get in my car and uh,
you know,

115
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,940
I just wasn't ready to drive or whatnot,
but,

116
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,070
um,
why didn't you look at the other car?

117
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,580
Because it all happened so fast.
Yeah,

118
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,211
sorry.
Yeah.

119
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,100
So it all happened so fast and,
um,

120
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,050
I just knew I was a,
I knew I smelled like alcohol and,

121
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,160
um,
I just felt like if the police came out,

122
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,410
it would be a bad situation for me.
And,

123
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,010
um,
I just thought the person that I hit had

124
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,020
to have been okay because I was totally 
okay.

125
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,210
I was like,
maybe this collision wasn't that hard.

126
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,480
Um,
so I just feel like in a lot of people's

127
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,980
minds,
they see me as like,

128
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,040
ah,
I knew it was this woman.

129
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,873
I saw this woman hanging out the window 
crying and bleeding or something like 

130
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,330
that.
And like,

131
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,550
I just chose the lever and I didn't know
what I had it,

132
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:36,400
no,
if I hit a truck,

133
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,580
I didn't know if I hit a,
uh,

134
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,863
a punch bug,
I didn't know what it was that I hear 

135
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,640
that just knows another vehicle.
B didn't even look,

136
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,290
no,
I didn't look wow.

137
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,270
And I didn't go back for cash,
but it doesn't make,

138
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,540
it doesn't make a what I did.
Okay.

139
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,740
The fact that,
you know,

140
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,780
I didn't go back for cash and I really 
went back for my boy,

141
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:56,680
that's,
that's no better.

142
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,830
Right.
Um,

143
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,660
the whole situation was just a shitty 
situation I was in.

144
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,070
I was in a really bad point in my life 
taking,

145
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,960
like I said,
everything for granted.

146
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,570
If you wanted to have a,

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,450
a situation come up with just like worst
case scenario,

148
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,760
that is the worst case scenario,
pregnant woman.

149
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,800
Oh yeah.
It makes me lack of monster.

150
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,570
Yeah.
It makes me look a monster.

151
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,280
When you found out as a pregnant woman,
what was,

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,430
what was going through your mind?
The man,

153
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,020
I am,
I'm done.

154
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,453
I'm done.
First I was afraid that there will be 

155
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,250
some type of,
uh,

156
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,650
problems with their baby because,
you know,

157
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,320
obviously if the,
if she had a difficult pregnancy,

158
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,154
then that's,
that's a whole different level of being 

159
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,760
in trouble.
Um,

160
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,620
God forbid if she was having a 
miscarriage,

161
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
um,
you know,

162
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,790
I would imagine that that would be 1000%
put on me.

163
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,624
So I thought about the fact that I went 
from just partying and join this career 

164
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:52,040
and this amazing fairytale life.
Um,

165
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,233
I went from,
I thought I was going from that to like 

166
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,750
literally being in jail,
being labeled as a murderer.

167
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,680
So that was my,
that was my number one thing,

168
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:04,140
was just hoping that the baby was okay.
What about,

169
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,770
what were you thinking about yourself?
Like when you did that,

170
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:07,604
when you ran?
I mean,

171
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,160
there's no way you can be happy with 
yourself that you did that.

172
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,890
What were you thinking?
Well,

173
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:13,980
I,
uh,

174
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,930
me and my mom have a great relationship.
I'm a mama's boy.

175
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,390
Um,
um,

176
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,940
and then I'm the father of four 
daughters.

177
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,200
So,
um,

178
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,270
you know,
if anything,

179
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,020
my,
my,

180
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,853
my respect for,
for women is I have tremendous respect 

181
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,450
for a woman.
And I tried to like,

182
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,180
uh,
obviously that being a father I like,

183
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,014
I tried to,

184
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,260
I just felt like a monster.
I feel like a monster,

185
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,670
you know what I mean?
Um,

186
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,970
I just felt terrible.
I felt,

187
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,050
I felt really bad.
I was just,

188
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,890
I was mainly just concerned with this 
woman's health and safety and I'm really

189
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,920
glad that she ended up being okay.
I felt really bad.

190
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:57,700
I was just like,
do it.

191
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,370
Even in the public side,
like you just heard a pregnant woman.

192
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,610
I'm like,
it doesn't really get worse than that,

193
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,700
but,
but yeah,

194
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,663
know I had no clue.
I had no clue that it was even a woman 

195
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:13,450
that I hit and I felt terrible.
And what was the,

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,833
what was not just the,
what was the reaction from your family 

197
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:19,830
and friends?
Um,

198
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,570
you know,
surprisingly it was,

199
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,800
it was okay.
You know,

200
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,710
um,
they,

201
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,180
they,
they support me so much and they love me

202
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:30,010
so much and they know that,
you know,

203
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,790
that I haven't really,
uh,

204
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,880
I believe I have a good heart.
They know that I have a good heart.

205
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,050
Um,
and they were just,

206
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,980
they were just thinking,

207
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,570
man.
Like did anybody step in and say,

208
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:42,070
hey man,
you gotta get your shit together.

209
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,720
Oh,
I've had,

210
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,770
I've had a lot of people telling me I 
need to get my shit together.

211
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,630
And what was it about?
Like what besides that,

212
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,480
what do you mean?
Like besides this one instance,

213
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,280
what other things have people come to 
you and say,

214
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,690
Hey John,
you've got to get your shit together.

215
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,030
Um hmm.
Well,

216
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,170
of all of it,
everything that's happened over the last

217
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,060
two years or whatnot,
uh,

218
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,570
it makes people feel like they can tell 
me that I need to get my shit together.

219
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:08,571
And I have recently,
I recently went outside to Mcguire's.

220
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,673
My garbage man was coming up and I was 
late getting one of the garbage out to 

221
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:16,260
the side of the road.
So he waited for me and he even told me,

222
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,400
he was like,
he was telling my garbage.

223
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,830
He's like,
hey man,

224
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,570
like I'm waiting to see you fight again.
He was like,

225
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,960
you really need to get it together.
I'm like,

226
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,480
man,
this dude is parked outside of my,

227
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,830
my little pretty boy.
He's telling me to get my shit together.

228
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,020
[inaudible] okay.
