1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,260
Three,
two,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,680
one,
the yes.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,830
We live.
Not yet.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,500
Pause,
hold.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,300
Youtube.
Some sort of a struggle.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,030
Yeah,
we're live.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,910
Okay.
How are you?

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,240
You're a wheeler walker jr fantasy.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,520
Um,
I,

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,413
maybe I will be.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,580
You will,
you never heard of him before?

12
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,260
I hadn't.
I confess.

13
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,960
That's okay.
Um,

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,350
so first of all,
thank you.

15
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,670
Thanks for doing this.
Appreciate it.

16
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,743
Yeah,
no problem.

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,670
What is it like,
I mean,

18
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:38,380
I guess is the best way to get this
started.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,060
What is it like being a person that grew
up in the Westboro Baptist Church?

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,000
For a person on the outside?
For me,

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,310
I,
when I think of that I think of like

22
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,820
this crazy,
hateful,

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,100
angry environment filled with like
really mean people that say horrible

24
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:00,920
things about gay people and all sorts of
other folks that I meet you and you're

25
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:02,900
super nice.
It seems so normal.

26
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,760
That is the conundrum.
So I mean a lot of the things,

27
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:08,590
the words that you just used to describe
the church,

28
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:12,790
that's definitely not how I experienced
it growing up for the most part.

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,480
Um,
I mean my family outside of when they're

30
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:20,440
out on the picket line,
their immune incredibly kind and gentle

31
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:22,300
and,
and compassionate.

32
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,630
And I think the biggest misconception
about the churches that they're

33
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:30,631
motivated by hatred and in their eyes,
it's the definition of loving what we

34
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,580
really thought we were doing,
what we were doing was loving our

35
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:37,030
neighbor.
So the first time that phrase appears in

36
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,490
the Bible,
it's in the context of when you see your

37
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,290
neighbor sending,
you have to rebuke him,

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,500
not just like watch him wander off on
this way to hell.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,340
So that was how we saw it.
We thought we were warning people in and

40
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:52,960
giving them the only hopeful message
that could save them from eternity in

41
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:53,750
hell.

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,500
Was there ever any dissent amongst the,
the people that were in the church about

43
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,270
like how the message is being
distributed.

44
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,240
Like if you're holding up a sign that
says God hates fags,

45
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,170
and,
uh,

46
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,010
a gay guy who was being buried at a
funeral and you guys were there

47
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:11,570
protesting with those signs,
like who's ever anyone inside the

48
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,920
organization that was like,
Hey,

49
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,250
this is not the way to do it.
These people are suffering.

50
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,084
And morning,

51
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,070
not really.
I mean,

52
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,720
once,
once my grandfather,

53
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,010
uh,
it was,

54
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,950
if he was the one who kind of developed
that strategy,

55
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:26,300
he thought,
so,

56
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,170
you know,
this,

57
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,990
the example is for funerals,
if somebody,

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,120
if they're burying somebody,
uh,

59
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,790
so a soldier say,
or a gay person,

60
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,610
uh,
it's an example of the curses of God.

61
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,250
So God says,
if you obey me,

62
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,760
I'll bless you and if you disobeyed me,
all cursio.

63
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,730
So why soldiers?
So several times in the scriptures,

64
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,770
it's this connection between the sins of
the nation and,

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,753
uh,
the,

66
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,560
the punishments.
So for instance,

67
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:58,070
in the book of judges,
it says they chose new gods then was war

68
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,730
in their gates.
Uh,

69
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,900
and then,
um,

70
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,560
in the books of the Kings,
it says they,

71
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,390
um,
uh,

72
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,360
there fell down many slain because the
war was of God.

73
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,220
And then in the book of Hosea it says
they have deeply corrupted themselves.

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,610
Therefore I will remember their iniquity
and I will visit their sentence,

75
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,220
though they bring up their children,
yet will I buried them?

76
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,830
There shall not be a man left.
So it's these,

77
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,200
these threatenings,
these warnings from God that if you

78
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,520
disobeyed me,
I'm going to curse you.

79
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:29,050
So we would go to these soldiers,
these soldiers funerals to warn the

80
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,780
living,
to say that if,

81
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,220
if,
if you don't want to be likewise

82
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,960
punished,
you have to repent.

83
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,940
You have to change your ways and,
and obey God.

84
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,990
No

85
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,480
people that are also hardcore
Christians,

86
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,090
uh,
that also follow the word of God very

87
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:46,060
closely,
but still would see like what you guys

88
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:49,870
were doing at these funerals,
holding up these signs,

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,850
protesting were a soldier who supposedly
gave his life for our freedom,

90
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,130
right?
Supposedly they're over there fighting

91
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:01,540
so that we can be safe here and that you
guys are out there with these signs,

92
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,260
like there had to be a lot of people
that have likeminded views in

93
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,210
Christianity but still were furious.

94
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,030
Yeah,
absolutely.

95
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,440
And from our perspective,
we thought that they were substituting

96
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:15,600
their righteousness for the
righteousness of God.

97
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,140
So they were upset that we were out
there giving this message that that was

98
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:21,810
100 percent biblical and our from our
point of view,

99
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,370
and they,
God calls that compassion when he sends

100
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:29,940
his servants with his message.
So we thought even though they call

101
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:33,390
themselves Christians,
they're ignoring these vast swaths of

102
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,820
the Bible that,
that support what we were saying and how

103
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:40,710
we were saying it.
So I mean there was definitely a lot of,

104
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,260
a lot of pushback from people on all
sides but,

105
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,250
and especially from other Christians,
but we just thought they're not really

106
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:48,800
Christian because they're not following
this.

107
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,580
We understand.

108
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,940
So you guys were pretty much solidified
in your opinion.

109
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,790
It was a consensus.
It was like everybody thought you were

110
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,624
doing the right thing.

111
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,060
Right?
So I mean,

112
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:00,580
so that when the soldier's funerals,
when those protesting,

113
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,110
it was in June of 2005 that we started
protesting soldier's funerals.

114
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,450
How's it brought up?
So my grandfather had been in since

115
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,840
2005,
so the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,

116
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,763
you know,
he'd been,

117
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,080
you see these things on the news,
uh,

118
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,120
and he,
he was the funeral funerals,

119
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:17,590
like what was going on at the funerals
and he said,

120
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,950
these aren't funerals,
these are patriotic pep rallies and

121
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,260
they're saying all these things about
God bless America.

122
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,590
Well God isn't blessing America,
God is cursing America,

123
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,800
so we have to go and,
and give a different message.

124
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,140
Um,
so that's how it came up initially.

125
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,460
Um,
but,

126
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,720
so I went to my first soldier's funeral
protest and then the following month in

127
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:41,080
July of 2005 and before I went.
So,

128
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,020
you know,
every time we would go to these things,

129
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,460
I was protesting from the time I was
five years old.

130
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,980
So when you go out on the,
you know,

131
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,040
to these protests,
a lot of times there would be a media

132
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,690
there.
They have people asking questions.

133
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,980
And I wasn't sure how I would answer if
somebody asked me,

134
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,970
why are you at this funeral?
I didn't,

135
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,080
I wasn't sure how I would answer it.
So like I felt very when I found that I

136
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,390
was going,
I thought I thought I need to,

137
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,340
um,
I need to understand this.

138
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,120
So I went to my mother and she brings
forth those verses that I just quoted to

139
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,200
you.
And several others.

140
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,380
We sat down as a family as we did every
night,

141
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
um,
you know,

142
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:20,420
to read the Bible and to talk about
world events and the church's

143
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,060
interpretation of these events in light
of their understanding of the scripture.

144
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:24,894
So,
you know,

145
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,730
she goes through and explains these,
you know,

146
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,620
very carefully.

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,130
And because her answers came from the
Bible,

148
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,990
I was,
that was my,

149
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,250
my foundation was that the Bible is the
infallible word of God.

150
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,960
And that it's true no matter what any
human thinks and that we have a duty to

151
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,090
obey at 100 percent,
no matter,

152
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,300
no matter what I think or feel otherwise
I have to bring my thoughts and opinions

153
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,590
in line with this.
So even though I had a lot of

154
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,140
trepidation at the beginning about going
to those funerals,

155
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,330
uh,
I very quickly acclimated to it,

156
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,910
you know,
as you do when you're in an environment

157
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:02,720
like that where everything depends on
you falling into line.

158
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,080
No.
What was it like when you first did it?

159
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,770
Like what was the reaction to other
people or you know,

160
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,170
other people's reaction to you

161
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,420
[inaudible].
So that very first one,

162
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:18,130
it was in Omaha,
Nebraska and it was incredibly tense.

163
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,860
Um,
so there was a bunch of cops.

164
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,600
We always,
every time we would go to protest

165
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,370
somewhere,
we would contact the police to make sure

166
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:29,371
that there would be a police presence
because people were tempted to end,

167
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:30,380
did,
you know,

168
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,860
would come after us physically and try
to assault us.

169
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,680
And again,
this has happened with some regularity.

170
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,500
So from the very earliest days of the
protesting,

171
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,420
we,
uh,

172
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,470
you know,
my mom and her generation,

173
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,610
you had made this decision to who I
should say many of them are lawyers.

174
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,380
So they would,
you know,

175
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,850
write letters from,
you know,

176
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,120
as,
as attorney saying,

177
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,520
we're going to be coming.
We're going to be protesting in your

178
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:54,190
city a peep.
This is what we do.

179
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,190
We hold signs on public sidewalks.
We are not violent.

180
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,920
We,
so explaining what a pro,

181
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,950
what are protests looked like and then,
and then saying if you want to avoid,

182
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,610
you know,
uh,

183
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,900
these kinds of violence that often
happens a be there.

184
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,740
So this first one,
how old were you in 2005?

185
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,350
I was 19.
So you were a kid,

186
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,230
you know,
but a grown kid and you know,

187
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:23,010
you're with your parents and this is the
first time you're protesting a veteran.

188
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,410
What,
what was that experience like?

189
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,680
So I'm standing across this floor,
standing across the street from the

190
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,000
church.
Like I said,

191
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,170
it's a,
was very solid,

192
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,340
very quiet.
There were,

193
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,100
which is not,
was not normal really for protests.

194
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:38,340
A lot of times we would be out there
singing and chanting and,

195
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,340
and making.
It was a big public display,

196
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,560
but this was a,
like I said,

197
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,080
incredibly tense.
Nobody was really talking,

198
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,770
nobody was really moving.
Um,

199
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,780
uh,
and you know,

200
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,630
the family was,
you know,

201
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,600
pulled up in a.
and I think it was in a limousine across

202
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:59,601
the street and the family got out and
looked around and saw us and they know

203
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:03,390
you guys were going to be there
beforehand because we always would

204
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,580
publicize that we would send out news
releases.

205
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,370
So they were aware that we were going to
be there.

206
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,980
Um,
and there were a bunch of,

207
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,340
I think they were marines,
uh,

208
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,290
like in dress blues,
standing there and they,

209
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,330
they looked incredibly angry and upset.

210
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,223
But like I said,
it was,

211
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,020
it was like,
it felt like at any moment if something

212
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,390
happened like that,
the whole situation could explode.

213
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,100
But again,
that's with the cops having the cops

214
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,440
standing there.
And so it was um,

215
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,780
it was,
it was,

216
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,740
it was pretty.
Uh,

217
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,670
it was,
it was really tense.

218
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,560
They weren't saying anything like,
no,

219
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,720
none of this.
Which like,

220
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,810
I was trying to say,
it's really unusual for protests like

221
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,380
that.
We,

222
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,010
a lot of times we would be exchanging,
you know,

223
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,880
we would,
we would of course would be yelling

224
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,580
about Bible verses and the hatred of God
and,

225
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,200
you know,
they would be talking about love and

226
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,690
tolerance and how we're wrong and not
Christian and,

227
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,030
but at this one it was,
it was very quiet.

228
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,980
It wasn't always like that.
So pretty quickly,

229
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,640
once again,
once we became acclimated to do those

230
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,740
protests,
um,

231
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,810
and also there,
have you heard of the Patriot guard

232
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,644
riders?

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,790
It was a group of motorcyclists who
decided to,

234
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,100
and they formed like an,
uh,

235
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,180
across the country.
So in every state there was a group of

236
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,890
these,
a motorcyclist who,

237
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,840
when they found out we were going to be
protesting somewhere,

238
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:17,450
they would go and,
you know,

239
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,900
rev their engines so that our words and
songs and such wouldn't be heard by the

240
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,910
family.
Uh,

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,410
and,
and they would hold American flags and

242
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,400
try to block,
you know,

243
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,060
it's always,
it's putting a buffer between us and the

244
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,890
family.
And uh,

245
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,080
so when,
when that started to happen,

246
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,220
it became almost like a game sometimes.
And in hindsight,

247
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,170
I,
this makes me cringe and,

248
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,050
and,
but,

249
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,930
but it became like this game of trying
to show that we were going to get our

250
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:52,920
message across no matter what any human
being wanted because we knew we were so

251
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:54,570
sure that this was what God wanted.

252
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,380
Wow.
What made you leave

253
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,360
a lot of things?
It started my very first sort of

254
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,820
conscious doubts came from conversations
on twitter.

255
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,010
So yeah,
something good drug.

256
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,460
Dm through twitter.
Yeah,

257
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,170
lots of good things.
I also met my husband there.

258
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,093
Oh,
there you go.

259
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,740
While I was still at the church,
it's kind of A.

260
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,660
I don't know that he would use that word
to describe himself.

261
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,540
I actually was just talking to Sam about
this and I was like,

262
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,100
when people,
the problem with the word.

263
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,630
Because when people,
when you say atheist,

264
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:31,560
people think jerk.
And like so many people do.

265
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,970
So many people think that like,
Oh,

266
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,940
you're absolutely certain that there is
no god.

267
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:38,040
And so it's,
it's a word that I hesitate to use to

268
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,270
describe myself too.
But,

269
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,660
but I'm not a believer.
I don't even know to say I'm not a

270
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,850
believer because I,
I love people,

271
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,470
I believe in people and that there is so
much hope and,

272
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,240
and for people and that we can,
I don't know.

273
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,520
Anyway,
so conversations you had on twitter did,

274
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:55,710
what do you like?
What,

275
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:57,850
what doors did the open your mind?
Right?

276
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,960
So I got on twitter and it was like an
extension of the picket line.

277
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,750
Right?
So go out there with picket signs and

278
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,580
you know,
people would come up to us and ask us

279
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,740
questions.
And so it was this,

280
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,870
it was a constant,
a constant conversation.

281
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,030
And so I got on twitter to take that,
you know,

282
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,350
to,
to the Internet,

283
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:16,810
to,
to reach more people.

284
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,190
And so one of the first things I did
when I got on twitter was to attack this

285
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,670
Jewish man named David Abbott Ball,
who ran a blog called Julius.

286
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,710
He was listed as the second most
influential Jew on twitter on this

287
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,660
number one.
Um,

288
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,680
I actually can't remember.
Not Memorable and I'm part of my story.

289
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:39,970
I guess you can check it at the Jta is
list if you want to change it,

290
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,990
but anyway,
so he was listed as number two and uh,

291
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,020
so he responded initially with sarcasm
and,

292
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,650
and,
and hostility.

293
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,170
Um,
but pretty quickly he sort of changed

294
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:56,170
tactics and started instead of like
mocking me,

295
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:57,820
although he still didn't do that some
too.

296
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,740
Um,
he was asking questions about our picket

297
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:04,570
signs and I started asking him questions
about Jewish theology because I wanted

298
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,030
to better know how to counter it,
you know,

299
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,430
to run the scriptures because I was sure
that they were wrong.

300
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,240
Jews killed Jesus and,
and they reject him as the Messiah.

301
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,390
And so all of these things,
um,

302
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,280
so,
um,

303
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,870
right.
So we're having this back and forth and

304
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:24,100
this goes on for about a year and during
that year I've actually met him twice.

305
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:29,101
I protested him twice once to his
functions or was he giving speeches?

306
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,100
So in Long Beach actually at the Julius
Festival,

307
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:35,750
they had this Jewish cultural festival.
Great,

308
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,730
man.
That's great.

309
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,700
He's great.
So He.

310
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,770
Right.
So he was going to be there.

311
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,490
Uh,
and you know,

312
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,140
I went when I was protesting him,
uh,

313
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:48,520
and he came out to the picket line and
it was,

314
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,410
it was one of those like very rowdy
pickets.

315
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,890
There was a bunch of,
a counter protestors and they were,

316
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,760
it was,
I don't know,

317
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,190
guys,
dresses like the Easter bunny and Jesus

318
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:59,410
and you know,
it was actually got pretty violent.

319
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,390
So I was actually super violent.
Well,

320
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:02,590
yeah,
and the cops,

321
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,240
this I told you,
we called the cops,

322
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,930
the cops were just standing there
watching people like actively assaulting

323
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,800
us,
like hitting us.

324
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,320
And so we're like walking around trying
to,

325
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,340
you know,
to not be hit because we're not going to

326
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:15,240
hit back.
We weren't there,

327
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,440
like I said,
the churches very against violence,

328
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,580
like they're not going to be violent to
people or defend themselves just to.

329
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,050
So I was actually really glad when David
came out because he became like a buffer

330
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:29,650
between me and the rest of the counter
protestors because everybody could tell

331
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,350
that he was wearing his delicious shirt
and whatever.

332
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,243
Anyway,
so,

333
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,660
so the conversation continued there and
then also at another protest a six or

334
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,040
seven months later,
um,

335
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,020
and then,
uh,

336
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,410
it was not long after that second
protest,

337
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,100
we're talking again and he was asking
about one of Our signs that said death

338
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:50,980
penalty for fags and you know,
of,

339
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,010
I'm reiterating why the church believes
that it has in the book of Leviticus,

340
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,710
God calls for the death penalty for gay
gays.

341
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,230
And then enrollment swollen in the new
testament.

342
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,020
Uh,
it's reiterated so they commit such

343
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:05,120
things are worthy of death.
So,

344
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,380
um,
and so I'm telling David these things

345
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,440
and he says,
I'm like,

346
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:12,890
yeah,
but didn't Jesus say,

347
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,110
let he who is without sin cast the first
stone?

348
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,600
And I said,
what we always said to that,

349
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,900
which was a,
we're not casting stones were preaching

350
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:23,480
words.
And he said,

351
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,070
yeah,
but you're advocating that the

352
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,270
government cast stones.

353
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,470
And I remember,
you know,

354
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,580
this is all through twitter.
Sorry,

355
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,230
I see this message and I,
I kind of gasped.

356
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:37,010
And I was like,
I had never connected that Jesus there.

357
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,020
Of course,
he was talking about the death penalty

358
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,580
specifically about the death penalty and
we were advocating it and so I wasn't

359
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:46,850
sure how to respond,
but he David kept kept going.

360
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,980
He said,
and what about this member of your

361
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,100
church who had a child out of wedlock?
And I said,

362
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,500
what about it like that?
This is another point.

363
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,810
You know people,
it was common knowledge.

364
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,990
People knew about this and what though
this interface,

365
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,450
and we would say the standard of God
isn't sinlessness.

366
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,410
It's repentance,
so she doesn't deserve that punishment

367
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,210
because she repented.
She stopped,

368
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,630
she wasn't having premarital sex anymore
and she knows that it's wrong.

369
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:13,730
And she changed her mind and she changed
her conduct,

370
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,380
which is what repentance is.

371
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,030
And he said,
yeah,

372
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,230
but she would have been killed if you
had instituted the death penalty for

373
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,800
that sin.
And it was the first time again that I

374
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:28,550
connected that if you kill somebody,
as soon as they sin,

375
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,880
they you lose the opportunity to repent
and be forgiven.

376
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,920
And so again,
so I'm just sort of staring at my phone

377
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,963
and,
you know,

378
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,781
in Topeka,
Kansas,

379
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,980
he's in Jerusalem and I really quickly
ended the conversation,

380
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,490
I don't even remember quite how,
but it was just sort of this like I

381
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,350
hadn't,
I didn't know how to handle this because

382
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,540
like I said,
the church is full of lawyers.

383
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:54,260
They're very intelligent and their
arguments and their theology for the

384
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:58,160
most part is very well constructed and
super consistent.

385
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,290
And so for there to be this,
you know,

386
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,700
this,
this hypocrisy,

387
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:05,990
this contradiction I didn't like my
brain was I felt like it was exploding.

388
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,450
So I went to a couple of people in the
church,

389
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:09,650
including my mother.
Um,

390
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,950
and the response was,
feel free to stop me at any time,

391
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:13,880
by the way,
I feel like I'm filled.

392
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,340
That's,
um,

393
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,490
so she,
she reiterated the same verses that I

394
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:22,400
had told David that,
that supported our position,

395
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,470
but she didn't address the
contradiction.

396
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,040
And when I seem to unsatisfied with it,
uh,

397
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,760
she said I was getting wrapped around an
axle and a just sort of,

398
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,631
you know,
push it aside.

399
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:37,631
And the response was so just to shut,
shut me down and then to move onto the

400
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,750
next thing,
which is,

401
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,100
it's a very human thing,
right?

402
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,870
When somebody puts something in your
face that,

403
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,570
that is this contradiction that you're
not ready to deal with or that you

404
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:45,910
can't,
you,

405
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,890
you know what I mean?
You cannot,

406
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,740
you kind of sort of push it aside and
try not to.

407
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,280
So the way that I dealt with it was to a
stop holding the sign because I knew

408
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,420
that if somebody asked me about it,
I,

409
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,990
I couldn't defend it because I didn't,
I didn't believe it.

410
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,950
But there was nothing else I could do at
that point.

411
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,490
And,
but the importance of that conversation,

412
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,610
this is obviously just one small
contradiction and one small

413
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:13,800
inconsistency and a vast,
you know,

414
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,080
we still,
I still believed that everybody outside

415
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:20,490
the church was basically isn't
completely wrong and,

416
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,530
and evil and slash or delusional and
that the church was basically right,

417
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,240
except this one point.

418
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,390
Does anybody ever feel that it was bad?
Use slurs like to use some sort of

419
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:34,780
insulting term for gay people instead of
saying God hates gay people.

420
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,530
So at the very beginning they did use
the word gaze.

421
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,050
It was a big change it.
Well.

422
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,040
So my grandfather would say that gay is
a misnomer.

423
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,570
These people aren't happy,
they're committing suicide and they're,

424
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,570
and they're evil and abominable,
and they have no peace.

425
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,130
God has taken their,
their piece.

426
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,080
They're not happy.
So gay is a misnomer.

427
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,430
And so the word the word fag,
they say like Amos,

428
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,720
in the book of Amos,
there's a,

429
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,330
uh,
it's translated firebrand there.

430
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,290
So my grandfather would say the word fag
is an elegant metafarm.

431
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,350
And it's,
um,

432
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,150
gays,
you know,

433
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,140
a bunch of fags are a bundle of sticks,
right?

434
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,460
Uh,
used for kindling.

435
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,880
So gays are,
they,

436
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,030
they burned in their lust one toward
another and they fuel the fires of hell

437
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,110
in the fires of God's wrath.
So it's an elegant metaphor.

438
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,220
GRANDPA gramps would say,

439
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,170
um,
do you know the original metaphor was

440
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:28,510
really supposed to be?
You mean from the Bible?

441
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,920
No,
the word faggot.

442
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,160
Oh No,
actually means a bundle of woods,

443
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,120
a bundle of wood,
and they would use that expression to

444
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:41,620
describe a woman because a bundle of
wood is burdensome,

445
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,830
like carrying around a bundle of wood is
very burdensome.

446
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,340
So when they would call a woman a
Faggot,

447
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,130
there were saying that she was
burdensome so when they would call a man

448
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:55,300
of Faggot,
they would say that he is burdensome

449
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,850
like a woman,
like a bundle of wood,

450
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,650
like a non manly man.
They can't get work done along those

451
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:05,890
lines.
And then it became used by people

452
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,950
erroneous Lee saying that it was about
burning them and that they would burn

453
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,280
gay people because they would burn
faggots of wood.

454
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,090
But that's not really the case.

455
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,610
Just sounds cool.
Yeah,

456
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:19,700
I actually had never heard that.

457
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,090
Yeah,
yeah.

458
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,740
If you go see if he could find that
Jamie Google that,

459
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,370
uh,
the original term faggot meant burdened

460
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,060
bundle of wood and burdened some,
like a bundle of what caused me to think

461
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:34,390
about like carrying a bundle of wood,
especially if you didn't have a truck.

462
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,480
It's a huge pain in the ass.
That's kind of what the source of it

463
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,314
was.

464
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,240
Wow.
Yeah,

465
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:39,950
no,
I had no.

466
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,730
I had no

467
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,730
people use it wrong and the real problem
is the people that use it wrong or like

468
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:49,540
gay activists and they try to say how
horrible that word is because it was

469
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,370
used to represent how gay people were
burned,

470
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,190
but there's never been like a time in
history where like,

471
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,100
there's a whole series of gay people
that were like burnt,

472
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,130
you know,
it's just like they drowned witches and

473
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:04,120
things were done like real specifically,
but it's never been like a thing.

474
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,690
What do we got here?
The word faggot has been used in English

475
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:11,710
since the late 16th century is abusive
turn for women,

476
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:16,711
particularly old women are referenced to
homosexual sexuality may derive from

477
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,480
this,
uh,

478
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,430
there.
Why does it have to be so weird the way

479
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,910
you got it?
Oh,

480
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,321
okay.
Yeah.

481
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,780
I can really get a Ba,
ba blah.

482
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,900
So there it is an alternative
possibilities that the word connected

483
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,930
with the practice of fagging in British
private schools in which younger boys

484
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:39,280
performed potentially sexual duties for
older boys.

485
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,250
Although the word faggot was never used
in this context

486
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,020
thrown,
thrown around,

487
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,970
but the big one means the bundle of
wood,

488
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,910
the bundle of sticks.
What's that,

489
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,800
Jamie?
What are you got something awkward to be

490
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:55,010
carried is right.
Yes,

491
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,850
exactly burdensome.
So that's where it comes from.

492
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,880
A really didn't have anything to do with
burning people,

493
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,420
but like they will,
they'll repeat it like to make a big

494
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,310
point,
like a big dramatic point,

495
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,360
but it's know melodramatic.
You would think I would know this given

496
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:14,660
our respective histories,
but I literally had never heard this in

497
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:15,494
my life.

498
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,400
Accordant distinction for why people use
that term because it's really just that

499
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:25,170
they're annoying.
I mean it's really just,

500
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,020
you know,
they just think of some non manly man

501
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:30,750
who can't get things done and he's
probably crying all the time.

502
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:31,584
These burdensome from

503
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,320
my experience of gay people since we
left,

504
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,830
obviously much more,
uh,

505
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,550
maybe reflective of reality.
A has not been.

506
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,960
What has it been like an impossibly
wonderful.

507
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,710
Don't overcompensate because you're
getting out of this bad environment.

508
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:48,950
I'll take you down to Santa Monica
Boulevard,

509
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,350
the of the guest spots on earth.
You'll see dudes would cut off shorts

510
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,040
and you'll change your tune.
What are they doing?

511
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:56,761
Well,
I mean,

512
00:22:56,761 --> 00:23:00,590
I'm not trying to like to paint
everybody with the one brush now either

513
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,940
been amazing.
As soon as you start being attracted to

514
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:04,680
men,
something happens.

515
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,920
They become different than every other
people.

516
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,380
Right?
Other world.

517
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,353
So,
I mean,

518
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,740
right after we left,
like at first I thought we have to hide

519
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:16,110
from the past forever and my sister and
I should say left together.

520
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,760
Um,
how old were you guys?

521
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,220
So I was 26.
I was almost 27.

522
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,350
Did you have a long conversation before
he did it?

523
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,440
Many memories.
About four months before between when I

524
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:28,910
first talked to her about leaving.
What was the first initial conversation

525
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:33,911
and how did you gather up the courage to
even sort of breach the subject?

526
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,390
Uh,
it was really terrifying and awful

527
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,651
because,
I mean,

528
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,390
I remember from the time I was very
young,

529
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,160
um,
there's this passage in deuteronomy that

530
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:42,720
my mom would quote and it's about,
you know,

531
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,270
if somebody,
uh,

532
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,360
if,
if your friend

533
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,490
did somebody close to you,
your,

534
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,310
your relatives,
somebody comes up to you and says,

535
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,420
let us go and serve other gods.
Like somebody secretly says to you those

536
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:56,810
things,
you have to stone them and you the one

537
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,650
that they came to,
you're supposed to be the first one to.

538
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,980
And my family's not stoning people.
Um,

539
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,010
but they do though,
if it's centered in the Bible.

540
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:04,910
And someone said,
hey,

541
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:08,480
we got a,
we have to serve this golden cow.

542
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,780
So they,
we also have an in the new testament,

543
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,810
it talks about rendering unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar's and to God's

544
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:18,800
the things that are got.
So we also have to obey the law of man.

545
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,960
We have to obey the law of sin and
weren't.

546
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:25,820
So we're not supposed to be.
I'm just so loved man supersedes the law

547
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,100
of God.
We're supposed to be obedient to the

548
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:28,934
laws of men.

549
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,530
But also,
I mean there this kind of a complicated,

550
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,580
I'm a little bit of theology where it
sort of undid a lot of the mosaic code

551
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:40,790
that we didn't actually have to follow
those things.

552
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,140
But honestly,
I don't know,

553
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,910
I think it's the whole,
I think it's like the death penalty for

554
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:47,270
a fag thing.
So like if they still believe that that

555
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:50,600
punishment is applicable,
then then we should be trying to

556
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:53,750
convince the government lobbying the
government to like with those signs.

557
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,430
So I'm so that I,
it was my sister.

558
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,290
If I went to her and said these things
to her,

559
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:04,730
she could easily have turned around and
told my parents not as a,

560
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,950
it's a culture of tattle tales,
not out of bad intention,

561
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:13,370
but because they believe that they're
trying to help you.

562
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,980
They don't want you to go down a bad
path.

563
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,490
So.
So we know when I,

564
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:20,324
it was,
it was.

565
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,680
I first thought of leaving on June was
July fourth and I was with my sister at

566
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,740
the time and when it first occurred to
me that I might,

567
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,710
that I might have to leave the church or
that the church might be wrong.

568
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,340
I thought I had to leave like that
second because if it even occurred to me

569
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:37,460
that meant I didn't belong there and
that God was going to punish me and that

570
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,350
I just felt like immediately so much
guilt and like I was a betrayer.

571
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,040
Was all your social life connected still
to the church?

572
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,800
Yeah.
And was this where had you already known

573
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,990
your husband by then?
I had,

574
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,450
yeah,
he was definitely part of it.

575
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,090
So,
but like it wasn't like that.

576
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,320
It's like the beginning,
like,

577
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,930
so,
so he was just another person on twitter

578
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:00,764
at first.

579
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,700
Um,
and it was,

580
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,920
it was,
it was like friendly conversation and

581
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:05,900
this went over to the,
you know,

582
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,090
for the course of several months.
Um,

583
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,110
I dunno,
eight,

584
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,880
eight or eight months or so,
seven or eight months.

585
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,520
And then it was never,
there was never anything about feelings

586
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,380
or you know,
relationships are,

587
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:20,600
all that stuff is totally for ventures.
No,

588
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,130
nothing like that.
Like not even like,

589
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,390
not even anything,
like nothing.

590
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,240
Like it's just that my mind didn't work
that way and there is,

591
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:33,890
there can be no relationship like that
with outsiders but outsiders,

592
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,980
outsiders,
so you know,

593
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,500
and I,
I actually thought I was never going to

594
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,270
get married because most of the people
in the church,

595
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,590
about 80 percent or so of the people,
the church,

596
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,310
there's only 80 people or so anyway
where my immediate and extended family.

597
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,750
So I thought there's no way that I'm
going to,

598
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm just not going to get married.

599
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,030
That it was,
it wasn't,

600
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,970
it wasn't like an like an easy thing at
first,

601
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:00,120
but it was just,
it was just the facts on the ground,

602
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:02,100
you know,
like I could actually ground where you

603
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:05,200
had to date someone inside the church.
There was only 80 people in the church.

604
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:06,870
They're all your family.
You can't date your family.

605
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:09,130
Fuck yeah.
I mean,

606
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,610
I should say there were a couple of
people my age and they came,

607
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,350
they had just joined the church,
like,

608
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,233
you know,
that.

609
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,150
But I had no,
like,

610
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,790
I had no interest in any of them and it
was pickens

611
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,140
and uh,
but yeah,

612
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:25,770
it's,
it's,

613
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,940
it was kind of strange,
but I,

614
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,650
so I actually had a dream about meeting
I should say.

615
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,680
Also my husband at the time,
I didn't know,

616
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,100
he was totally anonymous on twitter,
like it's just his words.

617
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,210
I didn't know what he looked like.

618
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,410
I didn't know,
you know,

619
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,500
his name or where he lived or anything
about him except except these words.

620
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,300
Um,
and he was,

621
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,820
he was just curious and kind and,
and that sort of.

622
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,200
And He loved people and so he would sort
of always be pushing,

623
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,990
pushing the conversation back to.
It's like I'm giving,

624
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:04,740
it looks like I've told you all those
verses about protesting funerals and why

625
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,860
we have to go and do this and the
importance of it and why we have to

626
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:11,280
thank God for these tragedies because
God is sovereign and he's in control.

627
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:14,690
So I'm,
I'm talking about the scripturally,

628
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,710
like the justifying all these things and
he kept pushing it back to because he's

629
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:25,641
not super well versed in the Bible so he
didn't know how to like I see that the

630
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,440
Bible says these things,
but what about the family?

631
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:32,730
Like I just cannot imagine going and
doing these things to people and so this

632
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:35,850
is all happening like on as I'm.

633
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,970
So I'm also still having conversations
on twitter with so many other people.

634
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:42,750
So it's like twitter became this like
empathy machine for me.

635
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,370
Like so it's not just like on a picket
line where people are butting heads and

636
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,330
arguing and debating and,
and yelling and it,

637
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,780
it's,
I'm,

638
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,330
yes,
having these can be kind of aggressive

639
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:56,700
conversations.
But I'm also seeing like photos of their

640
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,880
cats and them,
you know,

641
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,850
exchanging,
you know,

642
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,240
joking with our friends.
And so I'm seeing a side of people and

643
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,980
sort of being immersed in this community
in a way that I had never been before.

644
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,430
And so it was really,
it's like I'm trying to say like when

645
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:13,770
you say why don't you leave?
Like it took,

646
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,460
it was so much sort of happening around
this time.

647
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,770
So when,
by the time this pile up of things,

648
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,350
um,
you know,

649
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,910
and I'm processing it as I'm going
through this,

650
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:32,060
I'm also talking to my sister and,
and she was the only and other people in

651
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:34,200
the church,
but she was the only person,

652
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,070
if I ever had a doubt or a question or
a,

653
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,060
like,
if I thought we're doing something wrong

654
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:41,320
here,
she was the only person who would say,

655
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,640
yeah,
you're right.

656
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,640
That doesn't make sense that I should
say my sister is,

657
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,530
um,
creative and artistic and had a,

658
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,820
like a little bit of a reputation for
being kind of rebellious.

659
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,500
Not as like submissive as my me and our
other sister.

660
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,640
Um,
so it was just this dynamic of,

661
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,620
uh,
you know,

662
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,410
between the two of us were,
she was the only person I could fully

663
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,430
articulate my thoughts and feelings to.
Um,

664
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,380
and so when I first thought of leaving
and I turned around and I thought I

665
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,070
literally,
it was,

666
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,230
we were painting at a friend's house,
painting the walls and I,

667
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,110
I turned around to set my paintbrush
down.

668
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,590
I thought it had to go and leave that
second and I turned around and saw my

669
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,670
sister and I thought I can't leave
without talking to her.

670
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,710
So the next day I,
um,

671
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,790
she came home from work over the lunch
hour and we would always like go up to

672
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:38,791
my room and we were talking about all
these doubts we were having and I was

673
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:44,371
crying and I put my head in her lap and,
and I couldn't even art,

674
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:48,310
like articulating the idea of leaving
was too much like it,

675
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,510
it's,
it's terrifying.

676
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,060
Um,
and it just seemed like impossible.

677
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:53,320
And I said,
um,

678
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,740
what if we weren't here?
And she said,

679
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,990
what do you mean?
And I said,

680
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,590
what if we were somewhere else?
And so that starts this conversation

681
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:03,520
where,
you know,

682
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:07,810
I cannot let go of all the things that I
thought that the church was doing wrong,

683
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:12,400
that are where our theology was wrong,
where we were applying it wrong,

684
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,223
I mean,
in a way that,

685
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,110
that was destructive and unscriptural,
um,

686
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,390
and she kept pushing the conversation
back to we're never going to see our

687
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,850
family again.
We're going to lose everyone and

688
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,370
everything that's ever been important to
us.

689
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,970
There is no hope outside this church.
All the things that we had learned about

690
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,480
outsiders that you know,
that they were evil and they could never

691
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,720
truly love each other or care about care
about one another.

692
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,510
They're really just enabling one another
on the path to hell.

693
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,140
So,
and so this,

694
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:44,740
this back and forth,
you know,

695
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:48,970
it goes on for about four months before
we finally actually left and,

696
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:53,740
uh,
it was as bad or worse and I could have

697
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:56,410
imagined.
But to get back to the,

698
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,200
well,
let's get to that bad or worse,

699
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:03,340
you could have ever imagined.
So I should show you left.

700
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,000
How did you leave?
Uh,

701
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,400
we,
we're talking to my parents and,

702
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,900
you know,
and it was another,

703
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,870
another issue had come up and I,
I couldn't,

704
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,490
we couldn't,
it was a battle that we weren't going to

705
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:16,910
fight again.
W W we can,

706
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,380
I should say in those four months,
I kept trying to articulate these doubts

707
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,910
in a way that the church would accept,
like trying to convince them not being

708
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:27,670
as open.
But as time went on I became more and

709
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:32,280
more open about,
about these questions and doubts and I

710
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,950
just,
I,

711
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,480
I couldn't,
we couldn't fight it anymore.

712
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,360
I just looked at grace and I said we
have to go.

713
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,100
And because we,
and I should say also we had already

714
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:44,420
been packing like we had.
We had started packing her things about

715
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,890
a little over a month before that and we
had started like taking boxes to our

716
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:50,690
friend's house.
Um,

717
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,060
and with the understanding,
he's actually our,

718
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,910
he was our high school English teacher,
um,

719
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,990
that we had kept up with on twitter.
And He,

720
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,050
you know,
we basically,

721
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:01,940
I told him,
you know,

722
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,910
if something changes,
if the church changes and these things

723
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,740
get better,
then we'll,

724
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,580
we'll,
we'll take a lot of stuff back and just

725
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:13,730
pretend like none of this ever happened
and he was just,

726
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,740
you know,
understanding and compassionate and

727
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,260
really supportive.
Um,

728
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,390
but,
so we had done all this stuff already,

729
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:23,060
but we actually had to go and pack the
rest of our things.

730
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,650
So we walk out of our parents' bedroom
and went and started packing and,

731
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,000
you know,
people started coming,

732
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,690
my brother and some of the elders and my
aunt,

733
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,501
my cousin,
you know,

734
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,870
people I,
we were very close,

735
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,930
like our whole,
my whole life revolved around the

736
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:42,290
church.
And so to look these people in the face

737
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,610
and say that,
you know,

738
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:44,600
this,
the,

739
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,231
you know,
the US,

740
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,620
them mentality,
it,

741
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,880
it,
the bonds that are created in

742
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,250
environments like that are incredibly
strong.

743
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,460
At least they were in our church.
And again,

744
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:57,520
most of these people are also my family.
Um,

745
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,960
so it was,
it was awful.

746
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,860
Um,
and I'm crying and packing and trying to

747
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:08,570
explain to them why,
why leaving and I can hardly talk,

748
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,463
you know,
just,

749
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,060
just,
I was so overwhelmed,

750
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:16,040
but I'm literally had to go back the
next day with a u haul to get the rest

751
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:16,910
of our stuff more.

752
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,890
Our parents helped us pack.
It's not,

753
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,440
it's not one of those,
uh,

754
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,360
like there are some groups like that
where they don't want you to leave.

755
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,700
They'll,
they'll try to stop you from leaving.

756
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:26,534
Like I heard,
um,

757
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,170
scientology that miscavige I.
Canberra's Ron.

758
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,050
Yeah.
He was talking about like fists,

759
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,600
like actual,
um,

760
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,010
obstacles to you leaving like
physically,

761
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:39,110
like they're not gonna you can't get out
of the gate,

762
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,220
like nothing like that,
you know,

763
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:42,560
my,
they always would say this is a

764
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:45,050
volunteer army and if you don't want to
be here then you don't belong here.

765
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,160
So it's just the,
uh,

766
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,330
it's the threat of losing everything and
everyone

767
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,030
being ostracized by and just sort of
expelled into this world that you

768
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,740
believe and have always believed is as
evil and without hope and doomed.

769
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,970
So how did you do it?
How did you get all your stuff packed?

770
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,650
People coming in there saying,
yeah,

771
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:07,540
I mean like they're,
they're,

772
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,390
they're trying to convince us,
but once they understand that we're not

773
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:12,920
being convinced that,
that,

774
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,670
you know,
they,

775
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,670
they walked away.
So I mean that night our dad dropped us

776
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:19,120
off at a hotel and then Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

777
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,720
Like it's,
it's,

778
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,450
it's so immediate that you become this,
you become other.

779
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,330
You become an outsider at like in the
next morning when he went back,

780
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:31,280
I rang the doorbell.
I rang the doorbell and I lived in that

781
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:33,560
house from the day I was born.
Whoa.

782
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Felt like you had to ring the doorbell
is not my world.

783
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,243
Yeah.

784
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,660
Wow.
Chris was like,

785
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:40,120
why don't you think

786
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,190
the doorbell?
And it was like,

787
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,340
there's no other.
There is nothing else like it.

788
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,960
This is not our home,
this is not.

789
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,140
So we go and we're packing all of our
things.

790
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:52,180
It was just,
it was awful just to.

791
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,530
I had been in those four months I had
been so terrified of.

792
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,940
Because I know knowing what was coming,
like just imagine you're going to lose

793
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:04,710
everyone in your life that you're just
going to like,

794
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,920
you're not going to like how your
parents met and fell in love or like

795
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:13,870
your grandparents and family recipes and
photos and memories and what did the

796
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,180
House list?
I'm like taking photos and voice

797
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:18,760
recordings and just all the time,
like in every.

798
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,230
It was just,
it's just,

799
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,350
it's overwhelming.
It's just um,

800
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,580
but did,
was there also like a feeling of relief?

801
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,860
Was there also a feeling of like we
actually did it.

802
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,110
I'm actually doing it.
It's actually happening.

803
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm going to get away from this.
I know this isn't real.

804
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,490
I know this isn't right.
Did you understand that?

805
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,324
It was a cult.

806
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,410
So I was really against and I still
don't attend not to use that word.

807
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:41,930
I mean it's,
it's,

808
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,470
it's a fine shorthand.
I guess for some it there are aspects of

809
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:46,090
the church that are not cultish for
sure.

810
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:46,840
Like,
like,

811
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,520
like what I just kept saying like
there's no,

812
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,410
they're not trying to get your money.
They're not trying to,

813
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:52,570
like the,
not some charismatic leader trying to

814
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,700
have sex with everybody's wives and
children or whatever.

815
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:57,730
It's nothing like that,
but there are definitely aspects that

816
00:36:57,731 --> 00:36:59,560
are cultish.
The fact that you can't,

817
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,080
there is no such thing as agreeing to
disagree.

818
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,820
Like that's.
And the,

819
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:08,030
the penalty for disagreeing,
uh,

820
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,430
is so high.
Like,

821
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,730
so there are things like that that,
that are definitely quote like,

822
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,450
but um,
but I was definitely,

823
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,290
I was not in that in that moment.
I was not okay with using that term for

824
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,124
sure.
Right.

825
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,380
It was definitely,
uh,

826
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,100
it was,
it took a lot of time

827
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,890
and well it's a derogatory term,
but what it represents is an ideology

828
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:30,950
that a group subscribes to.
It doesn't necessarily have to have all

829
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:34,310
the negative ramifications of an
ideology for the fit into the category

830
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:35,300
of a call.
Right.

831
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,140
Yeah.
And I,

832
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,110
and I totally understand that now,
which is why like,

833
00:37:39,111 --> 00:37:40,280
you know,
if somebody says it,

834
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:43,210
I sometimes will,
will say there are things that aren't

835
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:43,611
cold,
like,

836
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:46,340
and explain what I think is not.
But I'm also,

837
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:49,050
I don't do it every single time.
Like I understand that it's the,

838
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,360
so you get all your stuff after you ring
the doorbell,

839
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,200
you're gone.
And then how do you like enter into the

840
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:00,570
world?
Did you have a job back then or did you

841
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,910
have a job with the church?
Is the job of the church working for the

842
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,120
law firm?
So it's home job,

843
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,983
family

844
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:07,940
life,
just,

845
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,510
just everything all at once.
Um,

846
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,760
and then also of course you're going
into a world that I had just spent my

847
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:15,050
entire life,
you know,

848
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,920
protesting and just,
it's so crazy when I look back now at,

849
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,410
at videos,
which I couldn't do for a long time,

850
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:25,160
but there's tons of videos and
interviews and documentaries that,

851
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,270
you know,
or I'm,

852
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,160
I'm answering all these questions and I,
I,

853
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,810
it's,
it's crazy.

854
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,610
Were you there when Luther came to do
the documentary?

855
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,860
Did you talk to him while he was there?
Both Times.

856
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:36,230
He

857
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,270
was the first time it was a,
he was really super nice.

858
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,860
Um,
you know,

859
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,140
he came and can,
we were like making egg rolls together

860
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,810
and like going bowling and jumping on
the trampoline and,

861
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,530
and yeah,
he would come to pickathon and it was

862
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:54,790
really funny because like the,
so he came for three weeks but three

863
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,630
weeks,
like a month,

864
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,910
like one month he came for a week in the
next month,

865
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:59,350
came for another week and then came
again.

866
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,650
So the first time,
like I didn't know anything about him or

867
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:04,330
who he was really.
I mean I knew it was one of the BBC

868
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:05,600
obviously in that,
um,

869
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,800
but I hadn't seen any of his stuff.
And then before he came the next time,

870
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,910
uh,
I was supposed to be studying for a test

871
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:14,710
or something.
I was in college and uh,

872
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,100
I was procrastinating.
So I look on Youtube and find this

873
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:20,230
documentary that he did do,
do you know the one though?

874
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,110
I'm white supremacy than Nazis.
Louis and the Nazis.

875
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,440
So I watched that entire documentary and
I was like,

876
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,110
ugh.
Like I know what his angle is,

877
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,400
like the,
Oh,

878
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,770
these poor kids,
they were raised in this and they don't

879
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,560
know any better.
And at the time I was kind of indignant

880
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,560
because I was like,
I am a thinking person,

881
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,590
you know,
like I at all my life growing up,

882
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:44,710
like it wasn't ever just like I
explained about the soldier's funerals,

883
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:49,000
like I never just just went along with
something like I wanted to understand

884
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:52,000
why I needed to understand that it was
scriptural and from the Bible and so if

885
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,750
you could show me that then,
but like I am a curious person.

886
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:59,230
So,
but I just had never obviously

887
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:03,580
questioned like the,
the most foundational premises of our

888
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:05,920
belief system,
which is the Bible is the infallible

889
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:09,820
word of God and Westboro Baptist Church
are the only ones who have,

890
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,440
who can understand it correctly.

891
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,360
I just,
I just never,

892
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,780
I never really got got past that because
if it was in the Bible and it made sense

893
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,480
to me then it was fine.
So anyway,

894
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:23,210
so I was kind of indignant when I saw
what Lloyd was trying to do.

895
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:24,580
Like,
we're just poor children and,

896
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,160
and um,
so,

897
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,500
and I hadn't told my family and so then
everybody,

898
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,940
you know,
everybody knew about it,

899
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,050
um,
this,

900
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,990
you know,
what he was doing and I remember telling

901
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:37,300
him something about how he was,
it was insidious,

902
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,240
what he was doing because he was not
being honest.

903
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:43,270
He was being really friendly but not
being honest about what he really

904
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,010
thought about us.
Uh,

905
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,080
anyway,
well,

906
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,330
he said actually he actually addressed
it specifically in the second

907
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:53,200
documentary.
He said,

908
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,470
you've been saying this but,
but I've never pretended to agree with

909
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,304
you.
I've never,

910
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:01,210
I've been pretty,
pretty honest about it and I'm an

911
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:01,630
atheist.

912
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,040
I don't believe that what you're doing
is right.

913
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,440
I don't believe the Bible is the word of
God than at a.

914
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,120
um,
and so I,

915
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,280
of course then he's right.
He was exactly right.

916
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,870
Um,
but

917
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,450
I definitely couldn't see it at the
time.

918
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,830
Um,
will you leave,

919
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,400
you get out and then what do you do?
Do you get a job?

920
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,220
So I thought immediately.
So I,

921
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,070
my degree is in finance,
so I went through business school,

922
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,230
all these people saying,
you know,

923
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,180
start saving for retirement immediately
that it so,

924
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,220
and you know,
we believe that the doom of the world

925
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,900
was eminent.
So I never really did that.

926
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,570
So end of days type stuff.
Yeah.

927
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,760
Yeah.
So you were thinking that because of all

928
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:44,120
the sin,
one day there's going to be a reckoning

929
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:46,160
and all the Christians are going to
vanish.

930
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,930
Yep.
Destruction is eminent.

931
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:51,020
Was one of our sites.
Did you guys ever watched that movie?

932
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,620
Was terrible too terrible movies with
Kirk Cameron,

933
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,990
uh,
about the apocalypse.

934
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,310
God Damn left behind.
No,

935
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,780
they're so good.
You should watch them said they were

936
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:03,370
terrible.
I will.

937
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,140
Watch are terrible,
but they're so good.

938
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,680
They're so bad that they become like,
oh my God,

939
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:12,410
what the fuck is this?
Did you ever meet Kirk Cameron?

940
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,090
No,
I want to meet that dude.

941
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,750
Mm,
no,

942
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:16,890
I,
it's really funny.

943
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,520
Uh,
you listened to Sam's Sam Harris'

944
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,363
podcast?
Yes.

945
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,500
So this episode with Lawrence,
right?

946
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,840
He said something like Lawrence Wright
said,

947
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,640
said something like that.

948
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,810
Got Through of going clear the book on
Scientology.

949
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,780
Yes,
yes.

950
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,630
He said,
um,

951
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,080
he talks about Freud,
the narcissism of small differences and

952
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,700
I was like,
oh my God,

953
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,310
yes.
Like we other Christians,

954
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:40,160
like where some of our biggest targets
and we,

955
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,830
it would be like the smallest things.
Like for instance,

956
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:46,550
there was like one church that we had
some kind of like very little

957
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:49,010
affiliation with in the early days of
the picketing.

958
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,340
And uh,
then there are women started to cut

959
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:56,090
their hair.
Women are not allowed to cut their hair.

960
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,250
Cut your hair at all.
We weren't allowed to cut her hair at

961
00:42:58,251 --> 00:42:58,550
all.
Yeah.

962
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,750
No.
Oh my God.

963
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,880
That's hilarious.
Because of a Bible.

964
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:03,790
Verse versa.
Oh,

965
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,410
that's first corinthians 11,
14.

966
00:43:06,411 --> 00:43:08,420
I think.
Actually it says I'm a woman's hair is

967
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:09,260
her glory.
He says,

968
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:12,170
don't you know,
it doesn't nature itself teach you that.

969
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:14,150
It's a shame for a man to have long
hair,

970
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,270
but a woman's hair is her glory and it's
given to her for a covering.

971
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,110
So it.
And it says a long hair.

972
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,030
Right?
So my grandmother interpreted that to

973
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:25,910
mean uncut,
which again,

974
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:26,650
like I,
I,

975
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,610
I did not,
we didn't believe in interpretation at

976
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:31,220
the church,
like the fact that he was adding

977
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:34,580
something into the Bible that wasn't
there before because obviously you can

978
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:36,920
have long hair without install,
cut in.

979
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,130
But uh,
but it's like if long hair is good than

980
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:41,060
uncut,
better so.

981
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,320
And he had his rules.
Oh,

982
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,890
what about clothes?
Like how do you reconcile the fact that

983
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,720
you're not supposed to wear two
different types of cloth

984
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,490
so that.
So the,

985
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,870
the,
the church sees this as a distinction

986
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:57,510
between the ceremonial law of Moses and
the moral law,

987
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,080
ceremonial laws,
like mixed fabrics and keeping kosher

988
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,520
penalty by death of mixed fabrics.
I actually can't remember,

989
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,930
but we just simply preposterous like
that.

990
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,190
We didn't worry about it.
Oh.

991
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,660
Because we thought these passages in the
new testament said you don't have to

992
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:16,090
follow those ceremonial laws.
So we didn't worry about it.

993
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,790
But did you guys spend any time
researching the actual history of the

994
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,710
New Testament?
Like how it was constructed?

995
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,920
So not.
I mean some.

996
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,540
Yes,
but not really because in our minds a

997
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,290
god is sovereign,
right?

998
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,070
So the church believes predestination,
so God controls

999
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,890
everything and everyone.
So God controlled the construction of

1000
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:36,720
the new testament as well.
Exactly right.

1001
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,520
Even though it was done by men,
it was God's will to have it the.

1002
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,590
So it was all God's word.
Yep,

1003
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,760
exactly.
How convenient.

1004
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,460
You just don't have to.
You don't have to ask those questions,

1005
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,640
but what about the fact that it was like
Constantine wasn't even a Christian

1006
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:56,490
until his death bed?
Is that because God didn't want it to be

1007
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:57,810
that way?
It's just,

1008
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,520
it doesn't.
It's irrelevant.

1009
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,310
It's a nice sweet loophole.
If you could just say that it's God's

1010
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:04,500
will.
God knew the entire time.

1011
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,240
Don't worry about it,
but it's a bunch of men wrote it.

1012
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:06,870
Yeah.
What they did,

1013
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,600
because God let them do it.
But then the question is which version?

1014
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,230
Which is another question I sort of
instinctively avoided.

1015
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:16,050
It's like atheists would ask this
question like why the King James version

1016
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,800
and uh,
you know,

1017
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,370
you can't really answer it because it
grant said so,

1018
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,670
like,
that's not to say that my grandfather

1019
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,350
was the pastor pastor,
the pastor for the founded the Westboro

1020
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:28,710
Baptist church.

1021
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,150
I don't think we did,
but I think everybody kind of knows.

1022
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,470
So when I say grandpa was Grandpa Fred
Phelps.

1023
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,753
Yes,
exactly.

1024
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,490
Um,
anyway,

1025
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:43,491
just wanted to close that loop.
So just like,

1026
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,230
what was the,
what was the thought process behind

1027
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:47,700
like,
just accepting that kind of stuff?

1028
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:51,780
Like did your grandfather ever bring up
the even older versions of the Bible

1029
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:55,140
that they were finding like what was his
thoughts on like the Dead Sea Scrolls

1030
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:57,540
and things along those lines just didn't
address.

1031
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,980
It just didn't matter.
Because again,

1032
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,390
it's all God's word anyway.
It's God's will.

1033
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:05,050
It's God's word.
It's so.

1034
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:10,230
It's so fascinating when someone's so
rigid with their belief system,

1035
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:11,310
it's like,
this is it,

1036
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,770
and this is.
And as long as you believe that it's all

1037
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,760
God's will is like,
oh,

1038
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:16,200
well it's God's will.
Seriously,

1039
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,970
put the New Testament was written by
Constantine,

1040
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,020
a bunch of bishops and others,
God's will and God,

1041
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:25,020
let them do it and not just let them do
it,

1042
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:26,410
but caused him,
caused them,

1043
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,020
forced it,
made it happen.

1044
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,270
He knows what he's doing,
absolutely every,

1045
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:35,271
every word of our conversation.
God allow all the sodomy and all the

1046
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:37,410
crazy shit going on.
Why does God allow that?

1047
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,020
So this is why I'm not a Christian
anymore.

1048
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,280
You're confused and you're like,
what the?

1049
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,230
Well,
so there's this passage in Romans nine.

1050
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:46,650
Well,
it's not.

1051
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,110
It's not the only reason I should say,
but,

1052
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,700
but I have,
I have real trouble with this.

1053
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:54,150
And I think it's,
it's still hard for me to say I think

1054
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:55,890
this is evil,
but I think this is evil.

1055
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:01,260
There's this passage in enrollments nine
that talks about it gives us an analogy

1056
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:04,920
of God as potter and humans as clay in
his hands,

1057
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,660
and he uses the example of Jacob and
Esau who in the Bible,

1058
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,730
Jacob and Esau were twins and says,
well,

1059
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:15,030
they were yet in the womb before either
of them had done good or evil.

1060
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,120
God loved Jacob and hated Esau and it so
it paints this picture of God.

1061
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,280
It says,
what if God willing to show his wrath

1062
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:26,790
and make his power known,
endured with much long suffering,

1063
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,950
the vessels of wrath made for
destruction,

1064
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,070
so it says,

1065
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,220
God created some people as vessels of
mercy,

1066
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,570
people that he loves and others as
vessels of wrath made for destruction,

1067
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,350
so made for the express purpose of
destroying them,

1068
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,800
torturing them in hell for eternity.
So and then so he paul,

1069
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:49,720
who's writing he,
he paints this picture,

1070
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,670
God making you do all of the things that
you do and then blessing some and

1071
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,620
cursing others.
And he says,

1072
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:57,050
well,
you'll,

1073
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:00,220
you're gonna.
Ask Me then why does God yet find fault

1074
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,790
for who is resisted as well?
Right?

1075
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,760
So you guys making you do it,
why is he punishing you for it?

1076
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,490
Right?
If God's Megan do a horrible thing and

1077
00:48:08,491 --> 00:48:09,540
you resist as well,

1078
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,950
you can't resist as well.
So he makes you do it and then he

1079
00:48:12,951 --> 00:48:16,580
punishes you for it.
And the answer is you don't get to ask

1080
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:19,520
that question.
It says nay,

1081
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:23,150
but o man who are either applies against
God shall the thing formed,

1082
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:25,460
say to him that formed it.
Why Hast Thou made me this?

1083
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,650
Can you just don't get to ask that
question?

1084
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,010
And to me,
I say this is I've asked for.

1085
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:33,710
I spent a long time talking to
Christians,

1086
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,180
uh,
and you know,

1087
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,060
people have mostly Christians because
it's obviously it's new testament,

1088
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:38,990
so,
and,

1089
00:48:38,991 --> 00:48:42,620
but also talking to Jewish people about
the old testament and found so many of

1090
00:48:42,621 --> 00:48:47,540
the like interpretations.
So many of our beliefs are not,

1091
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,920
they're not fully supported by,
by the Bible and that there are so many

1092
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,410
different ways of interpreting so many
of our,

1093
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,350
the more destructive of our beliefs,
but that one,

1094
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,320
I have not found any explanation for
that passage.

1095
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:04,040
That's anything that makes any sense,
that's consistent with the text and,

1096
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,700
and not evil.
And I just,

1097
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,950
I didn't,
I thought I couldn't ask that question

1098
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:12,050
for so long when I was at the church.
Right?

1099
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:13,610
I thought,
I just have to accept this.

1100
00:49:13,611 --> 00:49:18,611
This is the truth and nothing that I
feel or think matters against it.

1101
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,310
Um,
but now I,

1102
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,280
I can't not think.
Of course you cannot ask the questions.

1103
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,650
Yeah.
That's got to be so strict.

1104
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:32,860
It's also strange when you read the
passages in the Bible,

1105
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:37,270
in their vowel and thigh and you go,
wow,

1106
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:40,990
like what a weird.
Like you're reading something in a style

1107
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,380
of communicating and thinking that we
don't even use anymore.

1108
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:48,070
Like how strange is that?
Like how like if you had a conversation

1109
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:52,120
with a rational person and they started
talking and thou and thy,

1110
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:53,950
you'd be like,
what are you,

1111
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,380
why are you using those words?
Like what's going on here?

1112
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:58,480
Are you okay?
Like are you a crazy person?

1113
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,750
But as long as you're quoting some
ancient stuff,

1114
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:02,720
you're allowed to do it.
Like,

1115
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:06,100
and it just,
it sort of highlights how bizarre

1116
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:11,020
scripture really is and how bizarre
these ideological imperatives,

1117
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:15,100
these ideological,
like pathways that are just completely

1118
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:17,440
rigid and carbon.
So you have to follow them,

1119
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,290
but then you're listening.
You didn't,

1120
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,050
nobody even talks like this anymore.
Like this is such a strange.

1121
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,990
And they didn't even talk like that.
Then when they wrote it,

1122
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,540
because you're with something that was
in ancient Hebrew and then it was

1123
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:34,130
translated to Latin is translated into
Greek and by the time it gets to English

1124
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,121
like,
boy,

1125
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:39,470
what a terrible game of telephone,
you know that the grape vine.

1126
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,110
Great.
So it's just,

1127
00:50:41,111 --> 00:50:43,960
these are the questions that I never
thought I could ask her that again,

1128
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,220
that it didn't matter because if God or
you know,

1129
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,120
for ordained all of it and then it
wasn't irrelevant.

1130
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:53,140
But there's also A.
I mean like there is so in this,

1131
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:55,570
I was talking to Sam Harris about this
this morning.

1132
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:58,240
He like,
there's so many things in the Bible that

1133
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,590
I find so much good there also.
And unlike the language is something

1134
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:03,311
that like,
yeah,

1135
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,010
I know it sounds so weird to people but
to a lot of people,

1136
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:07,510
but uh,
like the King James,

1137
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:08,550
like I,
I grew up like,

1138
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,100
again,
I,

1139
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,860
my mother was reading this to us every,
every night.

1140
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,370
And so these words,
there's actually a passage.

1141
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:18,280
It says,
I found that like talking to God,

1142
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:23,310
I found by words and I did eat them and
they were unto me the joy and rejoicing

1143
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:24,100
of my heart.

1144
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,190
Right?
So it was this thing where I loved it.

1145
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,650
I loved,
I loved these ideas.

1146
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:34,030
I thought I thought it was the truth.
And I thought it was like the definition

1147
00:51:34,031 --> 00:51:36,310
of goodness because God did it and God
said it.

1148
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,110
And,
but even now,

1149
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,600
like there's this one passage that I,
I really love.

1150
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,434
It says,
um,

1151
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,920
by long forbearing as a prince persuaded
and a soft tongue break at the bone that

1152
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:48,514
lasts.
Like that's,

1153
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:51,580
that's,
it's a soft tongue break at the bone

1154
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:52,450
that,
that phrase.

1155
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:54,800
I love the imagery.
I love the like,

1156
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,240
cause you know,
I did this Ted talk a few months ago

1157
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,280
and,
and uh,

1158
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,710
you know,
it was,

1159
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:05,050
it was kind of about this like modern
political discourse,

1160
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,180
this,
this tribalism,

1161
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,320
this is becoming this,
you know,

1162
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:12,140
these calcified positions and,
and failures of empathy and,

1163
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,043
and,
uh,

1164
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,690
like people think that because,
you know,

1165
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,490
they're so sure that they're right,
that their position is the right

1166
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:24,430
position.
They're willing to talk to the other

1167
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:27,160
side in ways that they're just,
it's just,

1168
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,680
it's terrible.
It's the way that I did at the church.

1169
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:31,210
It's the way that it's,
you know,

1170
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:33,160
that dismissive,
condescending,

1171
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,010
you know,
just a hostile,

1172
00:52:36,011 --> 00:52:36,844
aggressive.

1173
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:41,730
And that's like it.
That's not it.

1174
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,500
When people don't respond to it,
like they respond.

1175
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,470
It's whole complimentary behavior,
right?

1176
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:49,420
So when somebody approaches you a
certain way,

1177
00:52:49,421 --> 00:52:52,480
you tend to respond in kind.
So if somebody comes to you in kindness

1178
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:54,640
and compassion,
you tend to respond,

1179
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,120
you know,
in,

1180
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,900
in that way also.
And when you are angry and aggressive

1181
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:01,060
and hostile,
like it just elicits the same reaction.

1182
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:04,270
People get defensive and uh,
but that,

1183
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,170
that verse,
I love that verse.

1184
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,880
It's a beautiful verse.
Well,

1185
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:12,881
there's obviously some wisdom from what
those people were writing down and

1186
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,600
trying to translate what that wisdom
was.

1187
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,940
There was some really fascinating
pastures to me.

1188
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:24,110
It's always been most fascinating as a
time capsule,

1189
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,850
like when read it,
uh,

1190
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,311
Mike.
Well,

1191
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:29,070
regardless of who translated this
regard,

1192
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:34,310
this is still a thousand year old book
at the very least in terms of,

1193
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,180
you know,
or 2000 years old.

1194
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,660
Like that alone is really amazing when
you're reading the thoughts and the

1195
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:47,061
ideas of how someone was perceiving the
world 2000 years ago or roughly,

1196
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,760
you know,
there's something to it where you are.

1197
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:56,090
It also solidifies in my mind how
briefly human beings have been conscious

1198
00:53:57,391 --> 00:54:02,391
of their time here on earth 2000 years
ago is not very long.

1199
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,250
I mean,
it seems like an incredibly long time

1200
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:08,640
for a personal one of those to be 100.
But in terms of the age of the,

1201
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:12,900
the human race itself,
which I think they just backdated again,

1202
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:18,140
they found a new discovery where they
pushed back the oldest known human being

1203
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:21,210
by over a thousand dollars 100,000 years
yesterday,

1204
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,510
some new discovery,
some new bones.

1205
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,840
Wow.
So now they know modern human beings

1206
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:30,480
have been around for at least 300,000
years.

1207
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,280
It's probably going to go back even
further than that.

1208
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:33,600
They don't even know.
But,

1209
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:34,434
um,

1210
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,020
but that's so cool.
Like I was gonna say,

1211
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,700
I actually think I'm Rob Wolf.
Oldest Homo sapiens species discovered

1212
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:41,534
in Morocco.

1213
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,630
Yeah.
What does it say?

1214
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:47,891
Time.
Okay.

1215
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:51,740
Yeah.
At 100,000 years to the history of

1216
00:54:51,741 --> 00:54:55,130
modern human fossils,
these bones are from early anatomically

1217
00:54:55,131 --> 00:54:56,870
modern humans,
our own species,

1218
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:01,820
homo sapiens with a mixture of modern
and primitive traits and international

1219
00:55:01,821 --> 00:55:04,670
team of anthropologists.
Paleontologists and evolutionary

1220
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:09,650
scientists report a pair of papers
published on Wednesday and the Journal

1221
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,280
Medicine Journal Nature.
Um,

1222
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,740
evolutionary.
What was the,

1223
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:15,350
what was evolution talk like back at
home?

1224
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,010
Um,
we didn't believe it to how old?

1225
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,210
What about dinosaurs,
right?

1226
00:55:19,211 --> 00:55:22,660
Young Earth creationism.
One of the elders said something like,

1227
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,830
God brought baby dinos on the arc.
Really?

1228
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,480
Yeah.
I didn't make it.

1229
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,920
Yeah,
they drown.

1230
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,950
I don't know,
we just,

1231
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,820
it was not a,
we just,

1232
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,500
anytime there was any conflict or
apparent conflicts between the Bible

1233
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:40,680
and,
uh,

1234
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,370
evidence,
physical evidence,

1235
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:45,440
we just believe the Bible like,
because it's worse.

1236
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,510
Yeah.
So Bible.

1237
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,270
Wow.
But what you're saying about like

1238
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,890
ancient wisdom,
like there was this,

1239
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:51,780
uh,
so my husband,

1240
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,730
um,
he got super into Paleo a few years ago

1241
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,450
and uh,
he read John [inaudible] book,

1242
00:55:58,451 --> 00:56:02,380
uh,
the Paleo manifesto and he made me read

1243
00:56:02,381 --> 00:56:06,190
one chapter of it and it was called
Moses the microbiologist and Robb Wolf.

1244
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,770
I was going to say,
Rob Wolf mentioned it on your podcast,

1245
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,480
whatever that was a few weeks ago or
whatever.

1246
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:14,620
Um,
and it's so fascinating to like when you

1247
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,700
read Leviticus,
like without the context of,

1248
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,290
you know,
the time and then they were living in,

1249
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,060
um,
like it,

1250
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,080
a lot of it just seemed.

1251
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,480
I remember whenever we read be reading
this at home,

1252
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:26,291
you know,
as a family,

1253
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,590
like there was just so much of it that
seem like incredibly tedious and like,

1254
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,970
what are we supposed to be getting out
of this?

1255
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:35,860
Like I don't even understand.
So I read this chapter and it was so,

1256
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,950
like incredible talking about like
Jewish,

1257
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:43,990
the rules about washing your hands,
which is of course the simplest and most

1258
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:48,991
effective form of a hygiene and prevent
preventing pathogens and infectious

1259
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,620
disease.
Anyway,

1260
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:54,730
so like super fascinating like how,
how many of those laws make sense like

1261
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:58,060
what you were allowed to eat and what
you weren't allowed to eat because um,

1262
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,080
because of um,

1263
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,890
not eating pigs,
it was all sorts of parasites,

1264
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,280
right?
And then not eating like cats because

1265
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:06,600
cats eat,
like rodents will also carry anyway,

1266
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,500
but it's like it's super,
there's so much detail in there and it

1267
00:57:09,501 --> 00:57:11,480
was,
it's incredibly fascinating.

1268
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:14,660
So like there's,
when you think about just the history of

1269
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:18,860
humanity and how this book has shaped
people's lives for so long,

1270
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:19,694
it's,
it's,

1271
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,050
it's really,
uh,

1272
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,210
it's really,
it's really fascinating.

1273
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,980
Well,
it is an amazing piece of historical

1274
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:30,520
literature and it's amazing that so many
people have,

1275
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,100
not to use the term but use it as
gospel.

1276
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,480
I mean,
it's the right term,

1277
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:36,190
right?
And Pat,

1278
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,800
I always feel strange whenever I read
it,

1279
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,140
whenever I read it,
I feel strange.

1280
00:57:40,141 --> 00:57:45,141
So thinking about all the momentum and
all the history that has been altered by

1281
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:51,500
these words and by the application of
these words and your own history when

1282
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:56,550
your own life was essentially guided by
the application of the interpretation of

1283
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:59,890
these words that were thousands of years
old.

1284
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,380
I mean,
that is bizarre.

1285
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:07,150
But then what's even more bizarre to me
is that twitter's would snapshot of it

1286
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:12,510
is that interacting with people through
online was this open forum exchange of

1287
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:16,130
ideas.
And especially in twitter where it says

1288
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:17,620
140 character limit.

1289
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,140
Yeah,
that's it.

1290
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:22,700
It really bugs me that twitter gets such
a bad rap

1291
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,200
because it has saved your life.
You should have a teacher.

1292
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,530
This is twitter saved my life.

1293
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:28,590
I,
I,

1294
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,350
I think I might actually do that.
Actually.

1295
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,930
I went to twitter actually a year ago
and I'm going next week to um,

1296
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,120
I didn't drain their trust and safety
council.

1297
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,590
Oh really?
Yeah.

1298
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,580
That's always sounds so orwellian to me.
Then I found out some of the people that

1299
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:46,020
are on it and they're full of shit.
There's a lot of bs,

1300
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,630
social justice warrior nonsense going on
in that

1301
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,400
I'm not,
I'm definitely not on the censorship or

1302
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,220
you know,
trying to like stop people like shadow

1303
00:58:55,221 --> 00:58:59,220
banning people and I just don't know
enough about all of that stuff,

1304
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,990
but obviously like I'm definitely on the
side of,

1305
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,760
of.
I mean I want people to be able to

1306
00:59:04,761 --> 00:59:06,560
control their experiences on twitter of
course.

1307
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,600
So I mean you should be able to like,
um,

1308
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,530
definitely be able to block people and
meet people and all that stuff.

1309
00:59:12,531 --> 00:59:13,790
That's all well and good.
Right?

1310
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:14,540
That's what I mean.
Like,

1311
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:17,690
so you should control your experience.
Been like trying to stop people from.

1312
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,630
Because obviously somebody when it's,
when it's criminal,

1313
00:59:20,631 --> 00:59:23,330
when people threatening and it's
violence and threats of violence,

1314
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,900
I think that of course should be
illegal.

1315
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:27,420
It's illegal,
shouldn't be allowed on the platform,

1316
00:59:27,421 --> 00:59:29,100
but I agree.
And harassment,

1317
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:33,590
if you're harassing people or trying to
get people to harass people like

1318
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,090
soliciting harassment to others.
Like,

1319
00:59:36,091 --> 00:59:36,750
Hey,
let's go.

1320
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,690
Go after Megan.
She doesn't believe in the gods word

1321
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:40,860
anymore.
Let's go get her.

1322
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,490
Like those kinds of Oregon using the
platform for any sort of a fucked up way

1323
00:59:44,491 --> 00:59:45,020
like that.

1324
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:45,800
Yeah.
Yeah,

1325
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,820
but I'm obviously much more on the side
of the importance of the marketplace of

1326
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:52,940
ideas and being able to do everything.
Absolutely.

1327
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:55,370
Because people.
So many people,

1328
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:56,720
we.
We come to these,

1329
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,850
we come to bat ideas in so many
different ways.

1330
00:59:58,851 --> 01:00:01,160
Sometimes we argue ourselves there.
Sometimes we're influenced by other

1331
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:04,190
people,
but the way out of it isn't to pretend

1332
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,620
or try to push it out of the public
sphere.

1333
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,770
It's to engage it,
to shed light on it and to publicly

1334
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:13,550
argue against it so that other people
who might be tempted or starting to go

1335
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:15,530
down that path will understand.
In other words,

1336
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,830
we need to have people who can
articulate and defend good principles

1337
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,120
and to argue against bad ones so that
the good ones will rise to the top.

1338
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:25,580
Absolutely.
I mean that's everything.

1339
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,640
That's human discourse in general and
that's one of the main problems with

1340
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,840
really rigid ideologies that there's no
room for that and then you just like,

1341
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:35,510
it's God's word and this is it and you
just have to trust it.

1342
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:38,120
And there's baby dinosaurs on the Ark
and just kind of go,

1343
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:40,220
okay.
And because of that,

1344
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,083
that,
that,

1345
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,940
like,
I have a friend who's Mormon and she was

1346
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:48,941
Mormon for a long time and then she,
they just sort of drifted away.

1347
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,060
They decided it was kind of silly and
then they read into the church and they

1348
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:55,640
started like,
how did this get started?

1349
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:59,570
And they just decided maybe we should
spend some time away.

1350
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,690
And so they eventually left.
And one of the things that she said that

1351
01:01:02,691 --> 01:01:04,220
was really fascinating,
she said,

1352
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:08,990
um,
I'm really susceptible to like,

1353
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:13,100
like someone who's a bullshit artist.
So like she's like,

1354
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:15,020
I'm easily influenced,
like too much.

1355
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:18,230
So she's like growing up in this
fundamental environment is

1356
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:21,500
fundamentalist,
but where you don't question anything

1357
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:23,360
and you just go along with the word,
she goes,

1358
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:27,830
it leaves me really vulnerable to like
being influenced.

1359
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,761
And I was like,
wow,

1360
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:30,170
that is fascinating.
She's like,

1361
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:32,500
I'm really gullible.
Wow.

1362
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:33,920
Yeah.
It's like her,

1363
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:38,240
her structure of how she,
her questioning muscles were like wobbly

1364
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:41,300
and we can atrophy.
They just didn't have any pep to them.

1365
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,870
That's exactly the word I use also about
the decision making because if somebody

1366
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:47,150
else was always making the decisions,
if you never have to,

1367
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,640
like the is already there for you.
You don't have to figure it out for

1368
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:51,740
yourself.
So on both of those friends,

1369
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,850
like when after my sister and I left,
it was this sort of like more or less

1370
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:57,290
constant,
you know,

1371
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,500
processing and asking these questions.
So like I would have these.

1372
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,990
So for instance,
uh,

1373
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,910
like back to gay people after we left,
right?

1374
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,270
So,
uh,

1375
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,680
I got this guy wrote an open letter,
like he'd been somebody that I sparred

1376
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,000
with on twitter quite a bit,
um,

1377
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,370
and threaten to pick it but never
actually did.

1378
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,620
He wrote an open letter after a in my
sister and I published this statement

1379
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:20,970
essentially just the short explanation
that you know,

1380
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:24,690
we had left and that we regretted
hurting people.

1381
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:25,650
And that,
uh,

1382
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,950
we were trying to find a better way to
live basically just because we'd been so

1383
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:32,310
public at the church,
it seemed like we had to,

1384
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:33,283
it,
it seemed like.

1385
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,340
And also it's complicated,
but anyway,

1386
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:37,920
so we did this,
he wrote this open letter and response

1387
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,610
and invited us to church over at
Hollywood United Methodist Church.

1388
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,020
And He,
this guy,

1389
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:47,660
he was gay.
He is gay and Church Goer.

1390
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,520
Yes.
Yeah.

1391
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,550
And how's he working out?
Reconcile.

1392
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,860
Go stuff.
I was going to say,

1393
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:54,360
so you,
you said,

1394
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:56,370
um,
you know earlier,

1395
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:59,040
like just the accepting like whatever
you find in the Bible,

1396
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:02,310
so you therefore you have to accept it
and just go along with it no matter what

1397
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,160
evidence or whatever seems to contradict
it or whatever.

1398
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,150
I was gonna say like I encountered
people for the first time,

1399
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:10,270
including,
uh,

1400
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,780
I'm actually,
I'm actually not sure how he reconciles.

1401
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,270
I think it has to do with the love of
Jesus and,

1402
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,030
and you know,
grace and you know,

1403
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,550
just that's the Old Testament and
whatever.

1404
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,720
I'm not exactly New Testament refers.
It does homosexual.

1405
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:28,350
Yeah.
So I honestly don't really know a la La,

1406
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:29,184
La,
I'm not listening.

1407
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,640
Well,
so that's what I was going to say.

1408
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:35,070
Like I remember encountering for the
first time Christians who were willing

1409
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:35,831
to say like,
yeah,

1410
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:38,730
I know the Bible says that,
but I think that applied at a different

1411
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,950
time or I just don't believe that.

1412
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,160
Well,
like I know more than one that has a,

1413
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:48,300
an old testament bible quote tattoo.
Like,

1414
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,100
Hey,
you got to read the whole book man.

1415
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:52,360
So
God,

1416
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,480
I'm really into what you're saying.
Like,

1417
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:57,780
no,
you're not even listening,

1418
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,780
but like that,
like it's,

1419
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,810
it's honest,
right?

1420
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:03,850
Like,
to be able to say like,

1421
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:04,650
yes,
I,

1422
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,360
I,
I think this is good and to,

1423
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,910
but to have the wherewithal to say like,
yeah,

1424
01:04:09,911 --> 01:04:12,070
this,
this is good and this is wrong.

1425
01:04:12,071 --> 01:04:13,450
There's a Bible verse actually that
says,

1426
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,310
Hey,
the evil and love the good.

1427
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,580
And I love that.
I mean,

1428
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,760
and I don't want to say,
Hey,

1429
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,220
I'm talking about,
I'm not never,

1430
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:22,780
it's never about,
for me it's about people.

1431
01:04:22,781 --> 01:04:25,330
It's about ideas.
Like I think there are a lot of bad

1432
01:04:25,331 --> 01:04:26,460
ideas.
Uh,

1433
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:28,710
and so I try to,
well anyways,

1434
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,390
there are a lot about ideas and there's
a lot of people that get defined by bad

1435
01:04:32,391 --> 01:04:34,880
ideas and I think in that,
in that way,

1436
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:39,290
the Bible is a lot like people in that
you could take a really good person who

1437
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:41,660
does something stupid,
does something wrong,

1438
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,870
doesn't do bad,
and it doesn't mean they're a bad pr.

1439
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:47,660
You can't say like,
you are this time you ran this red light

1440
01:04:47,661 --> 01:04:51,080
and hit that car or you are this time
where you,

1441
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,700
whatever,
whatever you did that you shouldn't have

1442
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:55,220
done,
that you may have done impulsively or

1443
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,370
for whatever reason that doesn't
necessarily define you.

1444
01:04:58,371 --> 01:05:02,240
It's a moment in your life.
But we love to find moments like that

1445
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:03,320
and say,
that's you,

1446
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,600
tiger woods.
That is you.

1447
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:08,270
You are bad.
I don't like you now.

1448
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,940
I hate you.
Like no matter what you do in the

1449
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,610
future,
you will be defined by this moment that

1450
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:16,670
you got drunk and drove a car.
Whatever the fuck it is.

1451
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:17,503
It is.
It's,

1452
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,040
it's

1453
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,110
so frustrating.
And you know now like,

1454
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:22,000
like we,
we,

1455
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,240
the tendency now on.
Did you read Jon Ronson's book?

1456
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:25,820
Yes.
You did.

1457
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,880
I hear do.
Yeah.

1458
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,890
The.
So you've been publicly shamed like

1459
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,210
that,
that tendency that too.

1460
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,200
Well,
and my family like this,

1461
01:05:33,201 --> 01:05:34,050
this,
it's,

1462
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:38,650
it was incredibly judgmental like even
within the church and became even more

1463
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:40,480
so towards the end of,
you know,

1464
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:43,870
before my sister and I left where like
everything,

1465
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,730
this is the way that my sister and I
started talking about it after we left,

1466
01:05:46,731 --> 01:05:48,700
I was like,
it's like everything that looks bad is

1467
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:50,620
bad and everything that looks good is
also bad.

1468
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,570
Like you once you,
if you can,

1469
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:56,860
if you identify a person as some kind of
troublemaker or you know,

1470
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,560
you,
you can just read into the worst

1471
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:03,970
intentions and motives when it's just as
likely that it's,

1472
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,330
it isn't that like to generalize the
worst.

1473
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:06,940
Oh,
sorry,

1474
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,170
sorry.
It's getting under your jaw.

1475
01:06:09,171 --> 01:06:10,960
And so sorry.
Sorry,

1476
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,050
sorry.
That's okay.

1477
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:13,940
I kind of talked a little bit soft to
sometimes,

1478
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,960
but you just don't want to generalize
the worst about people and and make it

1479
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,310
make that their entire identity

1480
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,250
and there's a tendency to do that with
people that are also there.

1481
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,650
There are terrified of scrutiny coming
their way.

1482
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,520
So what they do is they cast it all out
on others instead of looking internally,

1483
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,720
sort of looking at their own actions and
the blue,

1484
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:40,180
they looked at find a fault in a person
and then that is their main focus and

1485
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,180
you see people doing that.
That is why tabloid journalism is so

1486
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:45,070
fascinating.
You go to the supermarket and you know,

1487
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,920
you know Matt Lauer's doing cocaine.
Oh look at that.

1488
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,510
You know,
like it's like right there in front of

1489
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:50,980
you whether or not it's real,
who knows?

1490
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:53,500
But it's like,
I want to see how he got caught.

1491
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,350
What did he do wrong?
What this person is doing,

1492
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:58,720
drugs or whatever.
Whatever anybody's doing,

1493
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:02,460
she's leaving him for her.
She's a lesbian and this,

1494
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:06,790
all this stuff that we love.
When someone is someone did something

1495
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:08,440
bad,
then everybody's watching it.

1496
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:13,360
We love it because we all know that this
creepy shit that we've done that if

1497
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:16,000
somebody found it and then everybody
started talking about,

1498
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:19,300
you'd be horrified.
So when you see someone getting caught

1499
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,780
publicly shamed and then this giant pile
on,

1500
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:27,400
it's very attractive to us in some weird
way and almost cathartic and almost a

1501
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:29,770
relief that it's not us,
you know,

1502
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,690
but it's so dangerous,
right?

1503
01:07:31,691 --> 01:07:34,000
Because it is when,
when you make it,

1504
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:38,800
when the penalty for speaking up and
possibly miss stepping in these various

1505
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:42,640
lists and I don't the whole idea of like
microaggressions,

1506
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,530
like I feel like fundamentally like it's
this like,

1507
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,680
and I understand like I'm not saying
like I think it's really important.

1508
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:53,530
Like I said this so many times,
like how we talk to people,

1509
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:58,030
like it matters how you talk to people,
but if we're always looking for,

1510
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,490
for offense,
we're going to find it.

1511
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,060
And so,
but so the problem is when people say

1512
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:08,200
something maybe not quite an exactly the
right way or they like the way that we

1513
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,320
punish people when we make the penalties
so high,

1514
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:12,010
you know,
for it.

1515
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:16,670
So just to go back to John's John
Ronson's book that Justine Sacco,

1516
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:21,860
she tasteless joke on twitter to her 170
followers or whatever,

1517
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:24,410
and then it blows up and her entire life
is over.

1518
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,110
People don't know the story.
What do you remember the joke?

1519
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,590
Uh,
yeah.

1520
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:31,460
I'm going to South Africa.
Hope I don't get aids.

1521
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,350
Just kidding.
I'm white.

1522
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah,
exactly.

1523
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,300
And that turned her life inside out.
Right?

1524
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,480
And I don't mean to say like,
I'm not saying like,

1525
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:45,860
I'm just saying that there has to be
more to get biblical grace.

1526
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,300
Like there's,
there's this,

1527
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:48,800
uh,
there's this writer that I love

1528
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:50,600
actually.
And she says that,

1529
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:52,550
uh,
the language of public discourse has

1530
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:53,750
lost,
uh,

1531
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:58,430
the house she put it.
It's public discourse has lost the

1532
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:02,930
language of generosity like,
and that I think that's really,

1533
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,030
it's really terrible.
But like so when you make the cost of

1534
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:08,660
misspeaking or,
or have have maybe not saying things in

1535
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:11,600
exactly the right way,
like we make that cost so high.

1536
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:15,200
What it does is it pushes out moderates
and what you end up with people on both,

1537
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,720
you know,
two ends of these extremes and they are

1538
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:21,020
the only ones talking and then it just,
it just again reinforces this,

1539
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:21,900
this,
you know,

1540
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:25,250
calcification and us them and tribalism
and,

1541
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,300
and it's,
it's,

1542
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,190
it's dangerous.

1543
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:30,640
I think you're 100 percent right.
I also think there's something that's

1544
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:34,420
going on where when you see someone do
something really stupid like Kathy

1545
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,950
Griffin holding up ahead of Donald
Trump,

1546
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:41,310
I think we realized that in our worst
day with our worst thought process,

1547
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:46,360
worse circumstances that could easily be
us in the worst.

1548
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:50,350
If you grew up in a fucked up way or you
have some imbalance in your personal

1549
01:09:50,351 --> 01:09:54,040
life or maybe have some chemical
imbalance or you're depressed or,

1550
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:58,300
and then you make a poor judgement call
or you get reinforced by other people

1551
01:09:58,301 --> 01:10:00,430
around you that are fools as well.
The next thing you know,

1552
01:10:00,431 --> 01:10:05,431
you're doing something dumb and that is,
that's why we like watching people

1553
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:09,430
balance do handstands on the top of
buildings because we know that we've

1554
01:10:09,431 --> 01:10:11,320
taken risks.
We know we've done something stupid.

1555
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:16,321
You can identify those aspects of human
behavior and the other folks and when

1556
01:10:16,331 --> 01:10:18,010
they're doing something particularly
terrible,

1557
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:21,070
there's a certain amount of relief that
it's not you and there's a certain

1558
01:10:21,071 --> 01:10:24,400
amount of fascination of how will this
play out and a certainly how is this

1559
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:27,400
person going to recover from this to all
that stuff is very,

1560
01:10:27,401 --> 01:10:32,260
very intoxicating to us as these tribal
animals that lived together and

1561
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:37,261
understand how valuable it is to have
the love and support of your peers and

1562
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:42,040
then that hate is so dangerous.

1563
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,850
The ostracizing,
ostracizing of the person from the

1564
01:10:45,851 --> 01:10:49,060
group,
the alienation of them from the social

1565
01:10:49,061 --> 01:10:50,290
community,
the,

1566
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,150
the,
the knowledge that they have,

1567
01:10:52,151 --> 01:10:54,730
that people are talking about them all
the time in an evil way.

1568
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,530
Kathy Griffin,
she's on American genius,

1569
01:10:57,531 --> 01:11:01,360
is going to burn in hell and all this.
That is going to be just eating away at

1570
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:04,420
our and we know it and it's one of the
reasons why we like to concentrate on

1571
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:08,890
it.
There's a certain amount of weird sort

1572
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:13,891
of voyeurism that's involved in any,
any sort of a public misstep that people

1573
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:19,491
have and then the pylon by in a lot of
people are just very,

1574
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,950
very unhappy with their lives.
And so when someone else does something

1575
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:27,240
screwed up that they can take away some
of the focus of their own missteps and

1576
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,270
focus it on this person and,
and throw rocks.

1577
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:34,410
And there's also just the sense of have
I mean righteousness,

1578
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,180
right?
The self righteousness,

1579
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:36,731
the,
the.

1580
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:40,080
Um,
and this is why there's a UGC.

1581
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:42,840
Sarah Silvermans new netflix special.
I haven't seen it yet.

1582
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,690
Uh,
so she gets to a point and she's talking

1583
01:11:45,691 --> 01:11:49,480
about like going out to a picket at
Westboro picket and wow.

1584
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,010
And I actually had seen,
she talked about this on Bill Maher a

1585
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,390
few years ago too.
And I just remember like,

1586
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,310
I,
I knew her as this,

1587
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:59,430
like I didn't really.
I of course know her anything specific

1588
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:00,630
except for her,
her comedy.

1589
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:03,870
She seemed kind of just kind of loud and
a little.

1590
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,490
I don't know,
she'd say things that would always make

1591
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:06,241
me cringe.
Like,

1592
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:08,160
just very,
like very blunt,

1593
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,250
you listened to her comedy while you're
in the church.

1594
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,240
Sure.
Little like,

1595
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,330
you know,
like they're,

1596
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:15,190
they're really like,
they're constantly,

1597
01:12:15,191 --> 01:12:16,870
they call themselves,
they're the watchers,

1598
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:19,120
right?
So they are looking around the landscape

1599
01:12:19,121 --> 01:12:21,550
and seeing like how the word of God
applies to all these people.

1600
01:12:21,551 --> 01:12:24,850
They have to in order to,
to comment on what's going on.

1601
01:12:24,851 --> 01:12:27,160
They have to know what's going on.
So what people are saying and,

1602
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,850
and the trends and,
and,

1603
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,890
and things.
Um,

1604
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,200
so,
so yeah,

1605
01:12:32,201 --> 01:12:33,790
so I,
when I saw her on del Mar,

1606
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,940
I expected her to be,
I dunno,

1607
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:40,310
like hostile and,
and whatever about the church when we

1608
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:41,970
started talking about them.
Well,

1609
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,500
what she said,
what she said was,

1610
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,550
at least on the,
on the special,

1611
01:12:45,551 --> 01:12:49,570
the way she put it was I am them like
she went out and was talking to members

1612
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:54,520
of my family and you know,
she said we have to see them as human.

1613
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,690
And she was kind to them on the picket
line,

1614
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,700
like told her,
she said,

1615
01:12:57,701 --> 01:12:59,740
I told the duty joke or whatever,
you know,

1616
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,920
trying and the picket or I guess one of
my cousins or something like snickered,

1617
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,780
you know,
when she,

1618
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,680
when she makes this joke,
uh,

1619
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:10,150
we have to see them as human and then
maybe they'll start to see us as human.

1620
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,660
And the way she put it on the,
on the Netflix special was that I am.

1621
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:17,170
Then I am the product of my experiences.
And so are they.

1622
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:21,000
And the only way you can change those
things as to add to the,

1623
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:24,700
those experiences like to introduce like
David did on twitter with me and my

1624
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:27,520
husband.
Like introduce these ideas in ways that,

1625
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,970
that people can actually hear them and
be moved by them.

1626
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,980
Yeah.
We love to categorize people into these

1627
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:37,910
rigid boxes that are unchangeable and
that you are this person.

1628
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:40,790
You will always be this person.
You are my enemy and you think this and

1629
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:44,420
you think that and you're a dirty
liberal and you're a disgusting

1630
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:48,050
Republican.
And we have these weird ideological

1631
01:13:48,051 --> 01:13:51,500
boxes that we love to shove people into.
That's a perfect example of that.

1632
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:53,570
I mean,
if they were little kids and they grew

1633
01:13:53,571 --> 01:13:55,340
up in that church and they're seven
years old,

1634
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,880
do we really believe that they would
have the wherewithal and the

1635
01:13:58,881 --> 01:14:03,080
understanding of the full spectrum of
human behavior to say that this is wrong

1636
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:06,590
and that we shouldn't be protesting at
this gay person's funeral and we

1637
01:14:06,591 --> 01:14:10,250
shouldn't be holding up these signs and
say God hates fags because God hates

1638
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,340
fags or not.
Like,

1639
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:12,100
are you right

1640
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,010
grandpa?
Like who would have the mind?

1641
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:20,580
What's incredibly brave is that you deep
into your twenties have this revelation

1642
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:29,500
and then have the courage to escape.
And so I want to get back to that.

1643
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:31,200
Like what was your job like?
What did,

1644
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:35,590
what was the first job you got a.
So I didn't get a job immediately.

1645
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:38,770
I thought I had to.
I thought I have to be responsible.

1646
01:14:38,771 --> 01:14:41,410
Like of course I'm with my sister.
Like we had some money saved,

1647
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:43,570
just we lived at home.
We didn't have a lot of expenses,

1648
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:46,510
like we used our money to travel across
the country picketing,

1649
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:49,120
but we still,
we still had some money awareness.

1650
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,480
We have to get out there and piss people
off.

1651
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,390
Oh wait.
I didn't always.

1652
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,920
I thought it was the greatest.
Like I thought like it was always

1653
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:57,291
excited.
Like,

1654
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:58,420
oh,
are you going on this picket shape?

1655
01:14:58,421 --> 01:14:59,420
Yeah,
I'm going to Los Angeles.

1656
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:03,520
It was just like a part of life.
You guys used to picket scientology

1657
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:07,690
Elidel and we're doing it in clearwater
wants to super boring.

1658
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,830
Like there was nobody out there.

1659
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:13,520
You got to rank the pickets by like,
I don't know.

1660
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:18,460
George W dot Bush's second inauguration
was like insane and there's like

1661
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:23,260
scientology post nine slash 11.
Most of them are really rough to hold up

1662
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:24,094
those signs.
Yeah.

1663
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,650
Especially we had a sign that said thank
God for nine slash 11.

1664
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:30,400
Oh God damn it.
And it was like we were stationed at the

1665
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:34,390
intersection of these three streets and
they were blocked off for the parade.

1666
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:38,110
So like he finishes his inauguration
speech and this huge crowd of people,

1667
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,740
like hundreds of that whatever.
How many thousands of people like flood

1668
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:43,780
down this thing and then they're stuck
in this,

1669
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,020
in this intersection waiting to go right
past us on the sidewalk.

1670
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:50,710
And so there was this a new,
they're seeing this like thank God for

1671
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:53,830
nine slash 11 and it was right after the
tsunami to a.

1672
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,280
So my mom had a son was holding the
thank God for the tsunamis or whatever

1673
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,460
and I'm like,
so people are just enraged by the time

1674
01:16:00,461 --> 01:16:02,830
they actually got to us.
So like we're standing like right at the

1675
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:05,140
edge of these barricades,
like so on the other side is the parade

1676
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:06,790
route.
And so like,

1677
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,410
you know,
people were like jumping,

1678
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,930
like some guy jumped on my back on one
another,

1679
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,600
like stealing signs and like jumped on
your back.

1680
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:14,140
Yeah,
like,

1681
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,270
so I'm,
I was like leaning over the barricade so

1682
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,830
he couldn't steal my sign.
Sorry,

1683
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:20,330
I'm not getting away from the mic.
And uh,

1684
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:23,530
so like one of my cousins actually like
gave his science to another church

1685
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:26,170
member and then it was like standing on
top of a Trashcan,

1686
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,790
like going,
come on,

1687
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,440
you guys like just,
just don't worry about them.

1688
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:30,040
They're not worth it.

1689
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,790
They're not worth it.
Like with my cousin who was just because

1690
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:36,000
it was so it got so physical,
like you know,

1691
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:38,620
people and like the cops saying you guys
aren't worth it.

1692
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:39,520
He was trying to.
Yeah,

1693
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:41,430
pretending he was one.
Yeah,

1694
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,850
exactly.
Oh Wow.

1695
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,220
Yeah,
that one got pretty.

1696
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,880
Yeah,
pretty.

1697
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,210
Got Pretty Dicey.
But get violent guy who jumped on your

1698
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:51,430
back like what did he do?
So I will,

1699
01:16:51,431 --> 01:16:54,490
I'm holding my sons and I'm like,
like I've talked myself into this

1700
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:56,680
barricade.
So like there's nothing else he can do.

1701
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,450
So He.
And there was like,

1702
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:00,610
there was,
I should also say there were cops just

1703
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:02,210
on the other side of the barricade just
like,

1704
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:04,160
like every five feet there was a cop,
I think there was.

1705
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:08,410
So there was like maybe 14,000 cops in
DC that exercise first integration after

1706
01:17:08,411 --> 01:17:09,740
nine slash 11.
So anyway,

1707
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:10,590
but,
so,

1708
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,730
I mean the cops were mostly just
standing there like I look over and the

1709
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:16,570
guy gets off and I'm like,
my,

1710
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,040
my brother is standing next to me who's
seven or eight,

1711
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,110
eight years.
He would have been like early twenties

1712
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,760
and uh,
um,

1713
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:26,840
this I see.
And when he jumped over the barricade

1714
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:30,880
because the way people were coming after
us and this cop like pulls out a,

1715
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:31,853
uh,
you know,

1716
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:34,930
club to and making us get back over the
bar,

1717
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:37,550
like jump back over on the other side,
like with these people who were,

1718
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,350
and not really doing anything but it,

1719
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:44,430
it would you expect the cops to risk
their lives even though you're obviously

1720
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:48,180
provoking people.
I mean you're obviously putting yourself

1721
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:52,680
in a situation where you're saying
something incredibly insulting and just

1722
01:17:52,681 --> 01:17:56,580
devastating to all these people that
lost friends or loved ones on nine slash

1723
01:17:56,581 --> 01:18:00,330
11 or in the tsunami or,
or have family members that are gay.

1724
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,550
I mean,
did you guys really expect the cops are

1725
01:18:02,551 --> 01:18:05,580
going to take the beating for you or the
cops are going to get involved?

1726
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,950
For sure.
I thought that he was like,

1727
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:08,900
it's their job,
right?

1728
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:11,370
They did.
You would never do what you did then.

1729
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:11,851
Right?
Like,

1730
01:18:11,851 --> 01:18:13,820
what if,
what if someone passed some sort of a

1731
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:15,840
loss and listen to you guys know what
you're in for.

1732
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,930
We have no desire to help you.
There'll be no police presence.

1733
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:20,220
Would you still protest?
Well,

1734
01:18:20,221 --> 01:18:22,410
we did that and that some cops did
respond that way.

1735
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:25,020
There'll be no police presence
whatsoever.

1736
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,090
And some where was that at?
Can't remember it.

1737
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,290
But it happened more than once a month.

1738
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,223
Yeah,
for sure.

1739
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:33,650
And like sometimes the cops would,
we'd say we're going to come to protest

1740
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:34,220
this,
you know,

1741
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,630
something.
And they would say,

1742
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:37,280
you know,
you can come,

1743
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:41,000
but you can't hold that sign or you
can't tell you step on the flag or

1744
01:18:41,001 --> 01:18:42,230
whatever.
Sometimes they'll tell us in advance.

1745
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:44,300
Sometimes they wait until we got this
step on the flag.

1746
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,170
Yeah.
Like we desecrating the flag was a big,

1747
01:18:47,171 --> 01:18:48,910
uh,
we saw it as an idol and you know,

1748
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,050
the American flags and I don't actually,
my mom got arrested.

1749
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,840
I had a,
we were in Nebraska and um,

1750
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,970
uh,
my little brother that were protesting a

1751
01:18:56,971 --> 01:18:59,660
soldier's funeral and we were like far
away from the church,

1752
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,680
but there was a group of people on the
other side of the street and they were

1753
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:06,080
all holding American flags all the way
from,

1754
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,060
from the road all the way up this,
you know,

1755
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:10,160
the long entry to the,
to the church.

1756
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,720
So we were quite far away and my brother
was nine years old at the time and he

1757
01:19:14,721 --> 01:19:16,190
did what he always did,
which was a,

1758
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,420
you know,
put down,

1759
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:20,360
lay the American flag on the ground and
stand on top of it and hold a picket

1760
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:23,210
sign.
And within like a couple of minutes,

1761
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:26,630
uh,
like nine cops showed up and started

1762
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:31,250
talking about arresting my mother for
flag mutilation and contributing to the

1763
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:33,740
delinquency of a minor.
And uh,

1764
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,430
so before they do the arrest,
you know,

1765
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,110
again,
my mom and my uncle were both there and

1766
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:44,111
they are both lawyers and my uncle's
like a Johnson versus Texas Supreme

1767
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,880
Court said in that case that,
uh,

1768
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:48,670
you can even,
you can utilize,

1769
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,990
not only can you mutilate a flag,
you can even burn it.

1770
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,450
And uh,
and that's perfectly lawful.

1771
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:56,870
And one of the cops was like,
we're not in Texas,

1772
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,830
we're in Nebraska.

1773
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,680
So like this is obviously a supreme
court case.

1774
01:20:00,681 --> 01:20:02,660
So it's.
And he said Supreme Court has

1775
01:20:02,661 --> 01:20:05,360
jurisdiction all over the country.
So in other words,

1776
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:06,620
I guess what I'm saying,
it's like the,

1777
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:10,170
the way that sometimes the,
they did,

1778
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:13,980
sometimes they were really good cops who
did their job more super professional

1779
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:18,480
and didn't let their beliefs about our
religious beliefs or their,

1780
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,420
what they thought about our message,
get in the way of them doing their job.

1781
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,970
But sometimes they did,
sometimes they were threatened to

1782
01:20:23,971 --> 01:20:24,820
arrest,
you know,

1783
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:26,310
my,
our parents,

1784
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:28,980
if they brought children,
they would take their children away from

1785
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:30,330
them,
you know,

1786
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:31,620
things like that.
But,

1787
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:35,370
but we absolutely expected them to do
their job like that.

1788
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:39,230
That was,
and this is the supreme court.

1789
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:40,680
Yeah.
I mean,

1790
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:43,590
I know you're not justifying it,
but it's

1791
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:45,880
from the point of view of something like
me,

1792
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:47,820
someone like me,
I,

1793
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,640
I would say don't bring any cops there.
No.

1794
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,740
If you,
if you start that kind of shit at a

1795
01:20:53,741 --> 01:20:56,890
funeral or for a soldier and a bunch of
people come by and beat your ass,

1796
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,370
well then don't do that again because
you're pissing people off and you're

1797
01:21:00,371 --> 01:21:02,230
hurting their feelings and you're
dealing with someone who's already

1798
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:05,520
emotionally scarred.
Those cops need to be out there stopping

1799
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:09,190
robberies and you know,
breaking and entering into people's

1800
01:21:09,191 --> 01:21:12,970
houses and car jackings and that's what
they're supposed to be doing.

1801
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:16,930
They're not supposed to be like helping
out people who are intentionally

1802
01:21:16,931 --> 01:21:20,590
provoking and emotionally disturbing
people.

1803
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,170
Right.
But I mean,

1804
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:24,330
so obviously from the treasury
perspective,

1805
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:27,690
it's like this,
it's a sincerely held religious beliefs

1806
01:21:27,691 --> 01:21:31,740
and the first amendment like what good
is the first amendment like this?

1807
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,633
Obviously this,

1808
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:35,800
but it's not a first amendment issue
like the car because the.

1809
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:39,220
No one in an official position is saying
you cannot speak

1810
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,770
well.
So compare that to like the campus,

1811
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:43,400
what's going on on these campuses,
right where,

1812
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:45,670
sorry,
you think that the cops shouldn't be

1813
01:21:45,671 --> 01:21:48,250
there to protect those people there?
They're provoking people and making them

1814
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:49,020
angry.

1815
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,270
Well,
it's a different sort of a scenario.

1816
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:54,360
Um,
I think the cops should definitely be

1817
01:21:54,361 --> 01:21:57,210
there to prevent violence on campus for
several reasons.

1818
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,390
One reason because I think you're
dealing with very young,

1819
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:05,391
very impressionable people who make very
poor choices and feel justified because

1820
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:09,300
they're around a bunch of people that
also have likeminded ideas,

1821
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,440
a lot of peer pressure,
a lot of diffusion of responsibility

1822
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:18,441
that comes from these massive groups of
people that are acting and the mob

1823
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:21,180
mentality that comes along with that.
I think it's very,

1824
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:26,040
very important to protect them from
themselves and it's a hot button issue.

1825
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,510
I think protesting at a soldier's
funeral is just gross.

1826
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,820
I agree with you.
I know you do.

1827
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,930
I know you do.
I mean,

1828
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:37,230
but I'm just saying I don't think the
cops have a responsibility to save you

1829
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:38,130
from being gross.

1830
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:39,850
Yeah.
I just,

1831
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,080
I,
I don't know,

1832
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,910
I mean obviously this was a supreme
court case.

1833
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,020
It became a.
Did you know that,

1834
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:47,620
that this was a case where we were sued
by the church?

1835
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,030
Yeah,
I do remember that.

1836
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,230
And how did that play out?

1837
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,353
Uh,
it,

1838
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:52,800
it went the first,
they,

1839
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:56,070
they want a 10 point $9 million dollar
verdict against us at the trial court

1840
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,520
and then it was reversed at the appeals
court and the Supreme Court said eight

1841
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:01,950
to one.
They have the constitutional right for

1842
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:04,440
them to do this.
This is their religious beliefs.

1843
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:06,340
They have a right.
Especially because,

1844
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:10,780
I mean sometimes I will say like I
described to you that very first picket

1845
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,140
soldier's funeral picket that I went to
that was very close quarters,

1846
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,150
you know,
we were right up on top of them,

1847
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:18,370
like if we had chosen to sing or when
you know,

1848
01:23:18,371 --> 01:23:18,900
that,
you know,

1849
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,450
they would have heard us,
but in a lot of instances we were way

1850
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:23,470
far,
far away.

1851
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:25,360
Like in that in the instance that went
to the supreme court,

1852
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:27,040
they were more than a thousand feet
away.

1853
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:30,850
There was like a hill that the family
didn't see church members,

1854
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:31,684
you know,
things like that.

1855
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:37,090
There was a.
So I mean they have a right to do it

1856
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,260
will the church and we
have a right to do it,

1857
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:48,010
say horrible things about someone who
just died or someone who lost a son or a

1858
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:49,690
daughter and war.
Yeah,

1859
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:53,140
I think obviously I don't think it's
terrible that they do do it and that was

1860
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:55,540
actually one of the things,
you know before my sister and I left,

1861
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:59,530
that was one of the.
I wasn't going to hold a sign that I

1862
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:02,610
didn't believe was true and I wasn't
going to go to any more funerals.

1863
01:24:02,611 --> 01:24:05,620
Protests were.
But do you think that the police should.

1864
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,200
I mean they're,
they're operating on tax dollars and

1865
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:10,340
it's a limited amount of resource.
I mean,

1866
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:11,800
we're taxpayers,
right?

1867
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,980
I mean sure you are,
but do you think the resources should go

1868
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:16,100
to get out of the house?

1869
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:16,781
Right?
Yeah.

1870
01:24:16,781 --> 01:24:17,940
No,
I know.

1871
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,310
But do you think that really the,
the cops,

1872
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:24,940
that's the.
An intelligent and adequate and fair use

1873
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:28,540
of resources to go and protect a bunch
of troublemakers.

1874
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,660
So it depends on what,
how you,

1875
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,010
how do you feel about the first
amendment?

1876
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:33,610
Like at the,
it's,

1877
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,860
it's,
it's the principle of the thing rather

1878
01:24:35,861 --> 01:24:38,410
than the applications.
Like this is just one application,

1879
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:41,950
like so who's to decide.
That's the whole idea.

1880
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:42,550
Like,
so who,

1881
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:46,540
what we have not interested our
government to decide what opinions are

1882
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,520
acceptable and what aren't.
So they don't,

1883
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,580
they don't get to.
But it seems like you're organizing

1884
01:24:51,581 --> 01:24:53,800
this.
So if you're organizing this sort of

1885
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:59,250
antagonistic display where you know
you're going to hurt dangerous time,

1886
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:01,360
right?
Don't you think you should hire your own

1887
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,180
security?
Like why should the police have to be

1888
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:05,110
there to secure you?

1889
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,820
Because.
Because this,

1890
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:10,570
it's the law.
They are supposed to protect like the

1891
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,440
again,
what,

1892
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,870
what good are first amendment rights,
right?

1893
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,730
To be able to say it's,
it doesn't protect popular speech,

1894
01:25:18,731 --> 01:25:20,500
right?
Because public speeches need protection.

1895
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,190
Unpopular speech needs protection.
So it's just again,

1896
01:25:24,191 --> 01:25:26,770
it's the,
the police are really there to enforce

1897
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:30,030
laws.
You don't get to punch somebody

1898
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:34,330
go.
So for instance,

1899
01:25:34,331 --> 01:25:36,160
like go back to the campus thing for a
second.

1900
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,160
You have these people who have announced
we're going to go protest this person.

1901
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:42,370
We're not going to let them speak even
though they've been granted permission

1902
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:43,120
by the,
you know,

1903
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,670
everybody like they're going,
they should be able to speak,

1904
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:47,440
right.
We're not going to let them speak

1905
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:50,910
because we don't like their message.
So if the cops know that that's gonna

1906
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:51,710
happen,
like,

1907
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:52,740
so.
So what happens?

1908
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,540
Like,
I'm just trying to let them shut it

1909
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:55,980
down.

1910
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,760
Um,
but I'm saying I think that's wrong.

1911
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:00,270
I think they should be able,
they should go and like,

1912
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,170
so this is what big Vito is,
what it's called,

1913
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:04,080
right?
I think in,

1914
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:08,120
in like the cops can't say,
well obviously this is still back to

1915
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:09,620
like,
it's not.

1916
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:13,760
If the cops say,
well you can't speak because you're

1917
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:16,450
likely to cause a riot or people to,
you know,

1918
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,020
some,
some kind of disturbance.

1919
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:22,100
Like they're not allowed to do that
based on like if it's just,

1920
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:26,570
this is religious opinion and we weren't
saying we want you to hurt us,

1921
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,400
we're not trying to provoke you to hurt
us.

1922
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:32,180
We're trying to deliver this message
that we think is the truth of God.

1923
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,230
Right?
So it wasn't.

1924
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,830
There's a difference between like
deliberately provoking and inciting

1925
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:39,470
violence,
like deliberately inciting violence and

1926
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,970
what we were doing,
which was,

1927
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:44,030
you know,
trying to proclaim this message that we

1928
01:26:44,031 --> 01:26:45,410
thought was the truth.

1929
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:48,170
Our goal wasn't violence.
Like we didn't want violence.

1930
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:52,070
That's why we contacted the cops.
We weren't going to attack them and,

1931
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:55,160
and we didn't want to be attacked.
We just want it to be able to exercise

1932
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:59,060
our rights without fear of without fear
of violence.

1933
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:03,110
That's the principles of,
of our democracy.

1934
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:06,020
Right.
So I'll see what you're saying.

1935
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:11,080
And I think that gets a little weird
when we're talking about people giving

1936
01:27:11,451 --> 01:27:15,620
speeches on campus and then having other
people shut down those speeches because

1937
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:19,280
I think that the people who are
protesting have as much.

1938
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:21,770
Right.
Especially if it's in their school,

1939
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:26,980
they have as much right to voice their
concern for this message as the person

1940
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:30,530
does distribute that message and if the
police come along and say we're going to

1941
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:32,510
shut down the distribution of this
message,

1942
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,730
most of the time they do it when things
are out of hand.

1943
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:38,150
So an excellent tool for someone who's
trying to silence people is to make sure

1944
01:27:38,151 --> 01:27:41,360
that things get out of hand.
I mean is why so that having the cops

1945
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:44,660
present like and,
and letting both sides have their voices

1946
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:47,600
without the ability to resort to
violence.

1947
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:50,120
So this is the whole idea.
Like we would in these letters that

1948
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:53,120
would go out to the cops.
Was that the idea of having a buffer

1949
01:27:53,121 --> 01:27:55,070
zone like a.
yes,

1950
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,720
we're going,
we want to proclaim our message.

1951
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,900
We want you to be out there too.
Like we loved and I honestly,

1952
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:02,660
we loved doing counter protestors were
there because it just brought more

1953
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:05,060
attention to our message.
I understand that,

1954
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:07,760
but I just think that you shouldn't.
Obviously it's not you anymore,

1955
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:11,360
but I just do not think that anybody,
especially from an offensive group like

1956
01:28:11,361 --> 01:28:13,130
that,
she'd be able to allocate resources that

1957
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:15,110
are public use will police.

1958
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,030
Well.
So we obviously we would make the

1959
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:19,700
decision on,
we didn't make the decision to,

1960
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,620
for them to like they decide like,
okay,

1961
01:28:21,621 --> 01:28:25,580
well is this likely going to like so
they can either be proactive and set the

1962
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:28,250
buffer zone or be reactive.
Like we're calling the cops because

1963
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:31,760
we're getting punched or whatever and
[inaudible] like they're going to go out

1964
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,540
no matter what it was.
We,

1965
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,800
when even when they would say we're not
going to protect you were,

1966
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,500
we would go.
I mean there were obviously,

1967
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:41,250
there were rare situations where,
uh,

1968
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,231
so for instance,
like,

1969
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:45,650
uh,
when Gabby giffords was shot in Arizona,

1970
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,820
we had a couple of,
I'm an FBI agent actually end a guy from

1971
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:51,620
the local police department come and say
like,

1972
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,070
you shouldn't go.
And because there,

1973
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:56,840
there's a nine year old girl who had
been killed in the church that they were

1974
01:28:56,841 --> 01:28:58,670
going to protest her funeral.
Jesus.

1975
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:02,670
And so they said,
I don't think we can protect you like

1976
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:03,850
this,
it's too volatile.

1977
01:29:03,851 --> 01:29:04,684
It's too.
Um,

1978
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,530
and so in that case we didn't,
we actually didn't go.

1979
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:12,230
That's kind of a chicken shit response
actually as I was going to say,

1980
01:29:12,231 --> 01:29:12,660
uh,
like,

1981
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:13,370
so

1982
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:16,350
the thing is,
so I was there during this conversation

1983
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,210
and my hurt,
my mom was explaining that we weren't

1984
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:19,060
gonna go,
um,

1985
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,990
it actually had more to do with
logistics.

1986
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:24,240
Like we couldn't get there,
like plane tickets

1987
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,160
then whatever.
Like we just couldn't get there.

1988
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,150
So it was like,
okay,

1989
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:28,740
like that's fine.
Like I hear you,

1990
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,680
but like so reasonable.
It's so fascinating to talk to you

1991
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:34,470
because you're such an intelligent,
reasonable person.

1992
01:29:34,471 --> 01:29:39,471
It's almost impossible for me to imagine
until I see like the little bit of

1993
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:45,410
resistance to the idea of this being a
first amendment issue and the police

1994
01:29:45,931 --> 01:29:48,240
there.
Then you kind of go back to the church.

1995
01:29:48,241 --> 01:29:51,360
I could see it boil up inside of you.
Well,

1996
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:52,194
let's just,

1997
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,660
we were talking about this a little bit
of I and just the whole,

1998
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:56,970
the importance of discourse in the
marketplace of ideas.

1999
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:59,640
This is one like I like,
again,

2000
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:00,250
I,
I,

2001
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:03,360
I just think it's so important and I
think it's important,

2002
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:06,030
you know,
because obviously my own personal

2003
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:09,150
experience makes me such a believer in

2004
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,560
are you've on a journey through free
speech,

2005
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,400
but most people will never experience
free speech so you don't even agree with

2006
01:30:15,401 --> 01:30:16,420
anymore.
Right?

2007
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,070
Yeah.
Which is even more crazy.

2008
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:22,170
So let's get back to your first job.
What was it?

2009
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:24,360
What was the first job?

2010
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,830
I worked at a,
um,

2011
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:29,710
very briefly like,
so I should say my sister and I,

2012
01:30:29,711 --> 01:30:32,830
we were in,
it was a couple months before I actually

2013
01:30:32,831 --> 01:30:33,780
got a job.
Um,

2014
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:39,120
we spent the first month with a cousin
of mine who had left the church a few

2015
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,300
years earlier.
She lived really close.

2016
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,940
She had left her as well.
Yeah.

2017
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,270
So you guys knew some people had made it
out.

2018
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:44,570
Right?

2019
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:46,790
But the thing is,
there's so many.

2020
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,890
My sister calls them Mindfox,
right?

2021
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:52,520
So like the thing about people who leave
is that they are demonized more than

2022
01:30:52,521 --> 01:30:55,820
anybody else,
even more than gays or Jews or any other

2023
01:30:55,821 --> 01:30:58,160
outsider.
It's x members who get the worst,

2024
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:01,370
you hear the worst things about them
because they knew the truth and they

2025
01:31:01,371 --> 01:31:02,990
rejected it.
Right.

2026
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,950
So I was what came when I thought of
leading,

2027
01:31:06,951 --> 01:31:10,400
like the last thing on my mind was that
I could go to an ex member.

2028
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:13,390
I thought you can't trust them,
that people like,

2029
01:31:13,391 --> 01:31:14,340
so it's,
it's this,

2030
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:15,174
this whole,
um,

2031
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:18,620
intensely negative instinctive reactions
to those things.

2032
01:31:18,621 --> 01:31:22,340
But obviously I overcame it and I
reached out to her a few weeks before we

2033
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:25,190
left and she was amazing,
like within.

2034
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,830
I hadn't talked to her in three and a
half years and had said all kinds of

2035
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:30,970
terrible things about her,
um,

2036
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:31,850
after she left.

2037
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:32,683
But,
um,

2038
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:38,030
but she was wonderful and she said like,
within like 30 seconds of like when I,

2039
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,370
when she understood that I was planning
to leave,

2040
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,960
uh,
I want you to come live with me.

2041
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:46,370
And it was,
it was amazing and so kind.

2042
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:50,210
And so where I lived with her for about
a month,

2043
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:51,920
um,
my sister was still in school,

2044
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:54,130
so she was,
we were traveling back to Kansas to

2045
01:31:54,131 --> 01:31:54,821
Topeka.
Sorry.

2046
01:31:54,821 --> 01:31:56,570
It's like,
so it's half an hour from my cousin's

2047
01:31:56,571 --> 01:31:59,500
house and you know,
four days a week while was still in

2048
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:02,950
school and so we were constantly running
into our family and driving by the

2049
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:07,390
pickets because they pick it everyday in
Topeka several times a day and a like at

2050
01:32:07,391 --> 01:32:10,900
the grocery store and on campus.
And so it was just,

2051
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:13,810
we needed to get away so we ended up
going to deadwood,

2052
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:15,040
South Dakota.
Um,

2053
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:17,390
my brother had been a fan of the TV show
and a,

2054
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,300
it just seemed like a,
a nice quiet place.

2055
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,820
So how many people went with you?
It's you,

2056
01:32:23,821 --> 01:32:25,760
your sister and your brother?
No,

2057
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:27,420
it was just,
just you and your sister and sister?

2058
01:32:27,421 --> 01:32:29,070
Yeah.
Did anybody else join you?

2059
01:32:29,071 --> 01:32:32,420
After awhile?
I have a brother who left about a year

2060
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:35,120
and a half after my sister and I did and
I have another brother who left about

2061
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:37,460
eight years before I did.
Wow.

2062
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,620
So another seven.
There's 11 kids.

2063
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:42,740
So seven are still at home and four of
us are out.

2064
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,830
Do you talk to them?
Yeah,

2065
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,600
the people who are out.
Yeah.

2066
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,080
What about the people that are in?
No,

2067
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:53,160
they won't have anything to do with us.
They're just like,

2068
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:55,710
I talked to your mom.
No,

2069
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,410
no.
Uh,

2070
01:32:57,411 --> 01:32:59,150
sh.
They,

2071
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:01,850
the thing is like,
so back to twitter,

2072
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:04,700
like that's how I know what are,
what they're up to.

2073
01:33:04,701 --> 01:33:06,800
Like I said,
I see photos like they post photos,

2074
01:33:06,801 --> 01:33:09,590
like I'm going to,
watching my little brother grow up on

2075
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:13,820
their photos on twitter and see what my
parents wanted.

2076
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,280
It's awful.
I mean it's,

2077
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:17,270
it's,
I'm glad.

2078
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,290
I'm so glad to be living now and not,
you know,

2079
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,310
before social media where I can actually
see these things and,

2080
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:26,480
and know what they're up to and a little
bit about how they're going to reach

2081
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:27,860
out.
I do.

2082
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:29,570
You do.
I mean,

2083
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,670
I do on twitter,
you know,

2084
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:33,990
there's this great about twitter.
Um,

2085
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,280
sometimes like I have,
they blocked me on my main account.

2086
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:41,090
Not all of them,
but a lot of them to mom blocked you.

2087
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,660
She actually created,
she,

2088
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,770
she got kicked off of twitter at one
[inaudible] point,

2089
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:50,540
so she had to create a new account.
So she didn't block me under new account

2090
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:52,120
yet.
Um,

2091
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:55,240
but blocked you in her own account.
Yeah.

2092
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,200
Wow.
Yeah.

2093
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:58,690
Deep.
Yeah.

2094
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:00,990
Your mom blogs you on twitter.
That's

2095
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,140
when you look and you see that you're
blocked.

2096
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,500
What is that?
What does that lump in your throat like,

2097
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:14,320
just want you to imagine like,
I can't believe it's so hard to think

2098
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:17,400
back to like I was incredibly close with
my mom and I,

2099
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,490
I love her and I miss her.

2100
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:22,660
Like I used to make coffee for her every
morning and like you go on walks

2101
01:34:22,661 --> 01:34:26,050
together and we spoke to her.
Um,

2102
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,540
well actually I,
I saw her to pick it a little over a

2103
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,020
year ago.
She didn't,

2104
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:34,000
she didn't say anything to me.
She didn't even talk to,

2105
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:34,834
you know,
she,

2106
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:37,360
she couldn't like baby that came from
her body.

2107
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:41,690
Loved you and raise you.
She can like,

2108
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,750
it's,
it's,

2109
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,860
it's so like when I think about like
when I was at the church,

2110
01:34:45,861 --> 01:34:47,600
and this is one of the hardest things to
articulate.

2111
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:51,530
I mean to the feeling of like when
somebody leaves,

2112
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:56,480
like there is no interaction.
So some people would ask like,

2113
01:34:56,481 --> 01:34:58,880
well what if you saw her at such a
place,

2114
01:34:58,881 --> 01:35:00,470
you know,
wherever at the grocery store,

2115
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,101
whatever.
Like what,

2116
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:02,930
what would you say?
They would ask me this while I was still

2117
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:07,931
at the church and it's so it's like a I,
the only thing I can compare it to is

2118
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:09,890
like,
it's like dividing by zero.

2119
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:13,430
Like the situation does not exist.
Like there's nothing there.

2120
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:18,520
The idea of trying to talk to her,
it is impossible.

2121
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,420
Right.
And,

2122
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:24,000
and that's the Colt.
Yeah,

2123
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,960
exactly.
That's the Jehovah's Witnesses.

2124
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:28,520
They call it a dis.
Fellowshipping,

2125
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:31,580
right.
They all have an excommunication ecology

2126
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:32,690
houses.
They all have it.

2127
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:37,550
It's one of the ways they control people
to fear of alienation and becoming like

2128
01:35:37,551 --> 01:35:38,151
them.
Yeah,

2129
01:35:38,151 --> 01:35:41,300
exactly.
So they'll talk to gay people,

2130
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:43,760
they'll talk to people with rainbow
shirts arm,

2131
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:46,640
they'll talk to ex soldiers,
they'll talk to those people,

2132
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:48,450
they won't talk to you.
Right.

2133
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:53,060
That's insane.
But this is one of your mana acid.

2134
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:56,070
When
I'm.

2135
01:35:56,420 --> 01:36:01,420
One of the great things about twitter
and the Internet in general is that it's

2136
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:04,100
a thing where.
So like obviously like my little

2137
01:36:04,101 --> 01:36:06,170
brothers for instance,
like they are,

2138
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:08,180
you know,
hearing all this bad stuff about,

2139
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,301
you know,
my sister and me,

2140
01:36:09,301 --> 01:36:10,270
anybody who leaves,
they,

2141
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:11,540
they'll hear bad things about us.

2142
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,210
But the good thing about the internet is
that they can go on,

2143
01:36:14,211 --> 01:36:16,460
they can go to my twitter account and
see what I'm actually saying.

2144
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,290
So I'm still,
I go through these phases where like I,

2145
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,290
I,
I,

2146
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:23,720
I will tweet and then I get like I
can't,

2147
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:25,160
I just like the,
the,

2148
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:28,310
the fear of judgment I guess from my
family and I just,

2149
01:36:28,311 --> 01:36:32,040
I just choose to focus on other things
and not post things on twitter but like

2150
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,400
I follow them on this other account that
I created.

2151
01:36:34,401 --> 01:36:35,450
It's not blocked.
Right.

2152
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:40,110
And it's just WBC accounts.
So like I see things that they say and

2153
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:44,180
like doctrines that I now believe are
unscriptural and so like I will tweet

2154
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:45,120
them,
you know,

2155
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,490
versus like this contradicts you.
Like and try to like basically doing

2156
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:53,540
what I was doing for them now against
them like just in this,

2157
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:54,883
in these instances.

2158
01:36:55,070 --> 01:37:00,070
And so there is some engagement a little
bit with my family on twitter because

2159
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:03,920
especially because of any like anything
that I do publicly,

2160
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:05,950
so maybe something about this,
I dunno,

2161
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:10,010
but like when my ted talk came out,
there was a couple of articles and like

2162
01:37:10,011 --> 01:37:12,520
people were tweeting it a lot and,
and uh,

2163
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:15,920
so my uncle and my aunt both were
tweeting,

2164
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:19,840
tweeting me and tweeting about me and so
I was,

2165
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,130
you know,
we're having this party I guess like

2166
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,270
just going back and forth about these,
these Bible verses and debating.

2167
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,850
And so all of that stuff is,
it's,

2168
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:30,291
it's,
I,

2169
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:33,170
I hope at some point hopefully we'll
have,

2170
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,570
we'll have some effect and in some ways
it already has.

2171
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:39,050
So like the day that I left,
there was a we're going to get to that

2172
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:44,051
job sometimes worry about
the day that I left my,

2173
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:49,010
one of my cousins came into my bedroom
while I was crying and packing.

2174
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:51,050
And I was asking like,
just very calmly,

2175
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:51,920
like,
this is my best.

2176
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,080
My best friend,
she was a year older than me,

2177
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:58,110
is a year older than.
And she's asked me why we're leaving and

2178
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:00,870
I'm describing a lot of things.
And one of the two I described

2179
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:03,320
specifically two signs,
uh,

2180
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,100
one of them was the death penalty for
fags and another one was fags can't

2181
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,130
repent.
And uh,

2182
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:13,860
she sent me a message the next morning
and I was describing versus that I

2183
01:38:13,861 --> 01:38:14,430
thought,
you know,

2184
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,470
contradicted those two signs.
And uh,

2185
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,480
the following morning she sent me a
message,

2186
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:20,100
a text message super early in the
morning,

2187
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:23,440
just like a,
just chewing me out basically like that,

2188
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:27,330
that I know that,
that leviticus and Romans one like the

2189
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,310
death penalty.
Like there's no,

2190
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,810
there's,
you have no argument.

2191
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:31,800
Like,
so.

2192
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,540
So what's your really your problem?
And um,

2193
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:38,160
so,
and then for a while after I left,

2194
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:40,710
like those signs were like everywhere,
like she's holding,

2195
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:43,830
my cousin changes her profile picture on
twitter to her holding those two signs,

2196
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:47,670
like screaming into the camera and like
one of the elders like making a snow

2197
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:48,900
angel with those two signs.

2198
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,730
And it's like,
so they're just like doubling down on

2199
01:38:50,731 --> 01:38:51,564
this.
Right.

2200
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,880
And so this goes on,
it's like during this time,

2201
01:38:53,881 --> 01:38:57,300
like I'm talking about it in like giving
a few interviews,

2202
01:38:57,301 --> 01:38:59,610
like talking about it.
They're like on twitter a little bit.

2203
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:03,600
I'm like reiterating the verses that
contradict them.

2204
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:07,170
And then like after more than two years,
like I wake up one morning and I

2205
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:07,740
checked,
you know,

2206
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:12,150
I'm checking their twitters and uh,
there was a blog post and they said,

2207
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:14,820
uh,
about that fags can't repent sign.

2208
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,680
And I was like,
oh my God,

2209
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:19,560
it's like open the blog post and it's a
for the first time ever they had

2210
01:39:19,561 --> 01:39:23,880
publicly disavowed assign and using the
same Bible verses that I had been.

2211
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:28,590
And I know that's just like a very small
point in the grand scheme of things.

2212
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:31,110
Right.
But the reason that's critical

2213
01:39:31,111 --> 01:39:33,470
reasoning,
but like,

2214
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,920
so this is,
this is the goal,

2215
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:35,160
right?

2216
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:38,850
So like to,
knowing this is what I do know the story

2217
01:39:38,851 --> 01:39:40,170
behind it.
I don't,

2218
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:42,060
I don't.
It was after my,

2219
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,700
my brother left.
So I don't really know,

2220
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:47,310
you know,
nobody who's left since then.

2221
01:39:47,311 --> 01:39:48,090
I also have,
I have to,

2222
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:50,400
to actually have my cousins have left
since then also.

2223
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:54,090
Um,
but none of them have any understanding

2224
01:39:54,091 --> 01:39:55,220
of,
of,

2225
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:59,370
of what happened.
So I don't know,

2226
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:00,263
I,
I'm not,

2227
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:02,190
I'm not trying to take credit.
I should also say like,

2228
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,173
well,
it doesn't matter.

2229
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:06,730
It doesn't matter.
It just changes.

2230
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,990
Possible gets into their head that what
they're doing.

2231
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:13,950
It's not in any way the teachings of
Christ.

2232
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:16,520
Right.
I mean like the thing is like some,

2233
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:19,320
some of it is,
some of it is.

2234
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:22,370
Yeah.
But like there's the huge bag stuff will

2235
01:40:22,371 --> 01:40:24,210
like.
So it's so crazy because like this is

2236
01:40:24,211 --> 01:40:26,400
something that I didn't realize until
after we left also.

2237
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,080
But like,
um,

2238
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,210
we thought,
remember I told you about love thy

2239
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:32,400
neighbor,
like they have a site in love.

2240
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:34,260
Thy Neighbor equals rebuke,
right?

2241
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:38,190
Because that's in leviticus 19.
That's how it describes,

2242
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,500
you know,
loves warning your neighbor when you see

2243
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:42,390
them sending.
So they don't have an opportunity to

2244
01:40:42,391 --> 01:40:45,130
repent,
but the one time.

2245
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,070
So in the New Testament,
uh,

2246
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:50,180
Jesus is talking with this guy and the
guy says like,

2247
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:51,630
hi,
do I inherit eternal life?

2248
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:52,840
And he says,
well,

2249
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,580
Jesus is what is,
what does the scripture say?

2250
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:56,440
And he says to love God and to love your
neighbor.

2251
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:58,510
And he says,
you're right.

2252
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:00,220
He says,
and who is my neighbor?

2253
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:02,530
And Jesus tells a story of the Good
Samaritan.

2254
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,530
So it's like this.
Do you know the story?

2255
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,650
Um,
how's it go?

2256
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:09,783
It's,
um,

2257
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:14,910
so this man says this man falls among
thieves and they beat him and leave him

2258
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:16,870
half dead.

2259
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:18,340
The beat him until he's half dead or
whatever,

2260
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,260
and you know,
steal his clothes and,

2261
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:23,130
and leave them there.
And then it says a,

2262
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:28,090
a priest goes and sees the man and he
crosses the street and walk by on the

2263
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:29,620
other side.
And then Levi,

2264
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,840
who's also like dealing with the things
of God,

2265
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:32,674
right?
Um,

2266
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:34,630
he goes,
does this same thing,

2267
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:36,610
crosses and,
and goes on,

2268
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:37,870
goes on his way.
It doesn't help them.

2269
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:43,230
And then the Samaritan stops and binds
up his wounds and puts them on his own.

2270
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:46,990
So it's puts them on his own beast and
taking them to an end and gives the

2271
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:50,440
innkeeper money to take care of him and
says anything that you spend more than

2272
01:41:50,441 --> 01:41:51,550
this,
I'm going to,

2273
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:53,140
I'll pay you back when I,
when I come again.

2274
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,320
So he's like actually practically taken
care of him.

2275
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:59,380
So Jesus says,
and who do you think?

2276
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:01,960
Which,
which of these was neighbor to the man

2277
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:06,010
who fell among thieves.
And he said he who has mercy on him.

2278
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:10,450
So in other words,
what I'm saying is we reduced loving our

2279
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:12,910
neighbor to preaching,
to picketing,

2280
01:42:12,911 --> 01:42:15,820
to putting words on signs and going out
and publishing them.

2281
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:17,980
That's what we thought loving our
neighbor was.

2282
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:21,250
But the one time,
the example that Jesus gives is not

2283
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,620
preaching like they,
they didn't go.

2284
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:25,660
Like the Samaritan didn't go and say
like,

2285
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:27,430
this happened to you because you're a
senator.

2286
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,880
Repent.
He went and helped them.

2287
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:33,760
And so like,
where was that on our picket signs were

2288
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:36,100
why?
Like why didn't.

2289
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:38,200
Exactly,
exactly like why,

2290
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:42,490
why didn't we,
why didn't we make that an issue for

2291
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:45,820
ourselves?
Like a primary part of our theology.

2292
01:42:45,821 --> 01:42:48,160
And why didn't we encourage others to do
it too.

2293
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,500
Anyway,
so that again,

2294
01:42:50,501 --> 01:42:53,140
this is something that I didn't realize
until after I did it was I was talking

2295
01:42:53,141 --> 01:42:56,020
to a couple of Christian friends of mine
who,

2296
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,740
who pointed that out.

2297
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,600
And I was like,
I cannot believe I missed that.

2298
01:42:58,601 --> 01:43:01,780
Like all those years like,
and what's crazy is like the,

2299
01:43:01,781 --> 01:43:03,070
in,
in the story,

2300
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,610
the priest and the Levi to the people
who are like dealing with the things of

2301
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:07,240
God.
Right?

2302
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:10,030
So they're presumably preaching.
It's not enough.

2303
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:12,730
That's not,
that's not the fulfillment of that.

2304
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,620
Yeah.
So anyway,

2305
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,460
there's like so many of these things
that I just couldn't see when I was at

2306
01:43:18,461 --> 01:43:20,000
the church because again,
you're,

2307
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:22,510
you're in this,
it's kind of an echo chamber.

2308
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:25,270
Like clearly we had access to the
outside world and we're having these

2309
01:43:25,271 --> 01:43:27,880
discussions.
But the problem with that discussion is

2310
01:43:27,881 --> 01:43:31,810
that in a lot of cases people just
didn't understand what our theology

2311
01:43:31,811 --> 01:43:34,330
actually was.
How we actually thought,

2312
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,500
which is why,
you know,

2313
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,570
David Habit Ball,
making this,

2314
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:38,493
you know,
judicious,

2315
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:42,520
like the fact that this was an ongoing
conversation that he really got into the

2316
01:43:42,521 --> 01:43:46,240
nuances of our theology and could really
understand where I was coming from to be

2317
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:48,880
able to make the point in a way that I
could understand.

2318
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:50,290
And that's,
I mean,

2319
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:53,090
I'm kind of in a position to do that
with my family now.

2320
01:43:53,091 --> 01:43:54,770
Anybody,
any of us who leaves and who

2321
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:56,420
understands,
you know,

2322
01:43:56,421 --> 01:43:58,210
can,
can try to push back in a way that's a

2323
01:43:58,211 --> 01:44:01,960
lot more effective than people who just
don't understand where they're,

2324
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:04,010
where they're coming from.
So you get this job.

2325
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:06,820
Yes.
I go to deadwood.

2326
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,290
My sister and I got a dead one.
And uh,

2327
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,590
we were only going to be there for a
month and then we're going to go back

2328
01:44:12,591 --> 01:44:14,570
and grace was going to go to school and
then I was going to get a job.

2329
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,870
Um,
and then I was in deadwood for a couple

2330
01:44:17,871 --> 01:44:19,000
of weeks and I was like,
I could,

2331
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:24,030
I the idea of going back to Kansas and
like being back in the shadow of the

2332
01:44:24,171 --> 01:44:28,220
church and seeing our family all the
time and like seeing them and not like

2333
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:30,470
it's,
it's constantly being face to face with

2334
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:35,471
rejection and the people that we love
the most and like the idea of going back

2335
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,210
to that environment,
like I,

2336
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:39,590
my cousin was wonderful and I love her
dearly,

2337
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:41,150
like I just couldn't go back there.

2338
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:43,720
So like the day before we're supposed to
leave deadwood,

2339
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:48,820
a grace decided to try out for a play
there and uh,

2340
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:52,040
an agreed to stay with me.
So he changed like all of her classes to

2341
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:53,960
be online and anyway,
so we're in,

2342
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:57,860
we're staying with Jehovah's Witnesses,
which we didn't know that when we booked

2343
01:44:57,861 --> 01:44:58,700
it,
it was an airbnb.

2344
01:44:58,730 --> 01:45:01,010
My first,
our first airbnb is a beautiful old

2345
01:45:01,011 --> 01:45:03,060
house in the black hills.
And um,

2346
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:04,670
um,
so yeah,

2347
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:07,090
like they,
they thought at first when they realized

2348
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,680
what was happening,
like who we were,

2349
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:11,780
we started having these conversations
and then we find out they're Jehovah's

2350
01:45:11,781 --> 01:45:15,140
Witnesses and they thought at first that
we might be disfellowshipped witnesses

2351
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,970
before they realized that was,
we were at the church anyway,

2352
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,540
so it was just like,
this is insane conversations about,

2353
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,573
um,
you know,

2354
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,700
doctrine and theology and interpretation
and,

2355
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,750
and it was just so mind blowing to see
that there were other ways of

2356
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:29,660
understanding these texts that are
consistent with the text,

2357
01:45:29,661 --> 01:45:31,370
but totally different than we
understood.

2358
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:33,740
Anyway,
the husband,

2359
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:37,340
Dustin is co,
owns a marketing company in deadwood,

2360
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:42,230
so I took a job there part time.
So what is your process or what's the

2361
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:46,050
journey from leaving the church going to
deadwood,

2362
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:50,540
the men becoming sort of a self
proclaimed atheist.

2363
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:55,640
Like how do you,
how do you completely remove yourself

2364
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:59,060
from the shackles of audiology or did
you know?

2365
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:00,890
So it's,
it's,

2366
01:46:00,891 --> 01:46:02,180
um,
it's definitely,

2367
01:46:02,181 --> 01:46:03,740
uh,
I didn't want to do.

2368
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:04,670
I don't,
I don't think it's possible.

2369
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:07,310
It's not like a switch flips and you're
just,

2370
01:46:07,311 --> 01:46:10,340
everything that you knew is gone.
You're obviously very rational.

2371
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:12,770
Yeah.
So it was like each,

2372
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:15,740
each time we'd be presented with a
situation that,

2373
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:19,100
that uh,
so like gay people or Jewish people or

2374
01:46:19,101 --> 01:46:23,780
these like Jehovah's Witnesses,
it was obviously I had the instinctive

2375
01:46:23,781 --> 01:46:26,650
responses to their ideas.
Um,

2376
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:29,450
and so,
but each time I would feel,

2377
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:31,050
feel something.
It would,

2378
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:33,960
I would just ask myself these questions,
you know,

2379
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:37,310
what am I feeling,
why am I feeling it?

2380
01:46:37,311 --> 01:46:39,770
Is this just instinctive?
What is the evidence like?

2381
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:41,960
Does what makes sense?
Like it's sort of like having to,

2382
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:43,800
to,
to,

2383
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:45,930
to try to reconstruct,
like,

2384
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,810
like actually look at the evidence
again,

2385
01:46:47,811 --> 01:46:50,010
like starting from scratch basically a
in a lot

2386
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,300
of ways.
So,

2387
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,360
so each time we're presented with these
situations like,

2388
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:56,850
you know,
it's because obviously like there's all

2389
01:46:56,851 --> 01:46:58,320
these like.
So for instance,

2390
01:46:58,321 --> 01:47:02,670
gay people like that actually didn't
take that long to change.

2391
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:04,650
Like,
because I,

2392
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:08,010
I had met a lot of gay people like while
I was at the church and,

2393
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:11,040
and they,
after we left and you know,

2394
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:12,870
we're talking to them and I'm like,
you know,

2395
01:47:12,871 --> 01:47:15,270
I,
I thought I was doing the right thing

2396
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,650
and,
and,

2397
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,770
and I'm sorry,
like I didn't,

2398
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:24,420
I didn't intend to hurt to hurt you or
to say hurtful things about you.

2399
01:47:24,421 --> 01:47:26,790
Like I thought I thought it was the
truth and now I don't know what the

2400
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:28,440
truth is.
I don't know.

2401
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:29,910
I don't know what I believe.
I don't know.

2402
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:32,310
I don't know what I'm doing.
Um,

2403
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:36,660
and like people,
I mean they responded to that.

2404
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:40,290
I mean like they were really
understanding and empathetic in a way

2405
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:42,750
that I never imagined people would be
like,

2406
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:45,130
given how,
I don't know if you've seen like a,

2407
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:48,600
it's really hard for me to still to go
back and watch some of those videos

2408
01:47:48,601 --> 01:47:50,700
because it's so,
it's,

2409
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:53,700
I know exactly where I was coming from
at the time.

2410
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:58,860
But it's so like the arrogance and the
condescension and the certainty that we

2411
01:47:58,861 --> 01:48:00,120
were right.
And now,

2412
01:48:00,121 --> 01:48:02,970
of course,
knowing like all the reasons why I don't

2413
01:48:02,971 --> 01:48:04,500
believe those things,
it's a very strange,

2414
01:48:04,501 --> 01:48:05,430
strange dynamic.
But anyway,

2415
01:48:05,431 --> 01:48:10,320
so like the fact that people were
understanding in spite of that long

2416
01:48:10,321 --> 01:48:13,200
history of all those things that I had
said and done at the church,

2417
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,000
um,
was,

2418
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,600
was,
was overwhelming and,

2419
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:18,210
and,
and wonderful.

2420
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:20,280
Um,
but anyway,

2421
01:48:20,281 --> 01:48:22,830
so like being,
I was basically my sister and I were

2422
01:48:22,831 --> 01:48:24,810
basically putting ourselves over and
over.

2423
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:25,770
Um,
we were,

2424
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:30,360
hadn't been in deadwood for very long.
When I got a message from David,

2425
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:32,630
it was on my,
on my birthday and I,

2426
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:35,730
I told him that we had left.
And uh,

2427
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,553
you know,
he,

2428
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:39,300
he saw it,
stopped tweeting,

2429
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:40,530
that's,
he knew something was up.

2430
01:48:40,531 --> 01:48:42,540
But I had stopped tweeting several
months earlier.

2431
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:43,823
And,
uh,

2432
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:46,890
so he invited us to come to the Jewish
festival,

2433
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:49,830
which was a few weeks later.
It's like end of February or something,

2434
01:48:49,831 --> 01:48:51,590
beginning of March.
And uh,

2435
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:56,130
I had protested the delicious festival
like three years earlier and all these

2436
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,010
negative associations and feelings about
Jewish people,

2437
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:01,860
but realizing I don't know anything
about Jewish people,

2438
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:05,070
like we've been protesting the synagogue
in Topeka,

2439
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:07,480
like all my life,
but I haven't,

2440
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,400
I don't really know what,
like,

2441
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:09,640
other than,
you know,

2442
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:13,170
just generally Jews killed Jesus and
reject him as the savior.

2443
01:49:13,171 --> 01:49:15,270
So therefore they're without hope.

2444
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:18,540
But I didn't know really much about
Jewish theology.

2445
01:49:18,541 --> 01:49:19,980
I didn't know anything about Jewish
people.

2446
01:49:19,981 --> 01:49:21,420
Like I'd never really spent time with
them.

2447
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:23,750
So,
so I wanted to go to the festival,

2448
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:24,850
my sister and I did,
um,

2449
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,880
because we wanted to,
um,

2450
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:29,520
we wanted to meet Jewish people and like
do this whole,

2451
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:32,160
it's this examining process like what do
we believe in,

2452
01:49:32,161 --> 01:49:33,680
why and what.
And,

2453
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:38,550
and we got so much like light and sort
of wisdom from other people like

2454
01:49:38,551 --> 01:49:41,580
learning what they believed and why,
you know.

2455
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:43,680
So.
And then David said,

2456
01:49:43,681 --> 01:49:45,360
yeah,
but you have to,

2457
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,100
you have to speak at the festival.

2458
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:50,630
And I was like,
no,

2459
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:51,880
no,
no,

2460
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:53,190
this is not happening.
Like I,

2461
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,780
I can't,
I cannot imagine facing these people

2462
01:49:55,781 --> 01:49:58,270
that I've spent so many years.
I thought I just,

2463
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:02,110
it just seemed impossible and it
terrified me to be coming face to face

2464
01:50:02,111 --> 01:50:03,510
with people and,
and I had,

2465
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:05,770
hadn't even been out of the church the
three months yet.

2466
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:07,660
So it was,
it was really scary.

2467
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:10,210
But my sister was like,
we're going,

2468
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:11,110
like,
she,

2469
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:15,670
she knew that we needed to have this
experience of,

2470
01:50:15,671 --> 01:50:20,671
of,
of learning about Jewish people and if

2471
01:50:20,681 --> 01:50:22,510
the cost was we have to talk about it
fun.

2472
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,730
And she still also said later she knew I
would do most of the talking.

2473
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:26,620
So it's like,
okay,

2474
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:29,830
fine.
But so we went and we spoke there and

2475
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:30,664
then I thought,
okay,

2476
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:32,770
that's great.
Now we're gonna like we need to figure

2477
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:34,030
out like grace.

2478
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:37,840
And I kept saying we want to do good
like that.

2479
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:41,860
That had been the motivating principle
of our life was to do good and now we

2480
01:50:41,861 --> 01:50:43,390
realize we did so much damage.
And,

2481
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:45,800
and uh,
so anyway,

2482
01:50:45,801 --> 01:50:49,540
so we were trying to find a way,
like we didn't know what to do.

2483
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:51,370
Like how,
how do you move forward from there?

2484
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:52,770
And so we,
we just,

2485
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,220
we didn't know.
Um,

2486
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:56,890
so we were kind of drifting that whole
first year.

2487
01:50:56,891 --> 01:50:57,750
We,
we basically,

2488
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:01,340
I think a month was the longest we spent
anywhere we were um,

2489
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:04,300
you know,
we went to visit x members of the church

2490
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:08,620
who were across the country.
My Dad's family who we never knew

2491
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,750
growing up because they were never part
of the church.

2492
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:11,850
So I mean,
like we,

2493
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:14,500
we had seen them,
like they would come visit for a few

2494
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,830
hours sometimes or maybe a couple of to
visit even though there for a while.

2495
01:51:17,890 --> 01:51:20,020
But then my several years before we
left,

2496
01:51:20,021 --> 01:51:22,630
they cut off all contact with his family
there also.

2497
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,680
It had been very limited already.
But then spoken to your dad either.

2498
01:51:27,530 --> 01:51:29,680
So he spoke to his family?
Yeah,

2499
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:31,800
his,
his parents and his brother.

2500
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,560
My,
my grandmother.

2501
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:36,860
I called her,
um,

2502
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:39,430
about a month,
a little over a month after we left,

2503
01:51:39,431 --> 01:51:44,170
one of my first nights in deadwood and I
told her we have left and she just

2504
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:47,470
immediately started crying and she said
I had been waiting for this for 30

2505
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:49,630
years.
Like she had my older brother had one of

2506
01:51:49,631 --> 01:51:53,050
my older brothers had left since,
since my dad had joined the church,

2507
01:51:53,051 --> 01:51:54,320
is what she was saying,
you know,

2508
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:58,780
she,
my dad's parents are so there's,

2509
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:02,140
they're amazing people like his dad is,
it was career air force.

2510
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:03,970
He retired from the,
from the air force.

2511
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:06,070
Um,
and they're,

2512
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:09,850
they're wonderful people and all we
could see of them was,

2513
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:12,330
well,
they're divorced and remarried there.

2514
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:14,290
They're going to hell.
There are a bad influence.

2515
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,360
And like,
it what's,

2516
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:19,720
it's,
it's insane to me now to think like my

2517
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:24,721
grandmother has been without her son,
her son for decades and how painful that

2518
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,180
must be.
Like I've only been,

2519
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,040
it's been four and a half years since I
left.

2520
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:33,370
And what am I going to be doing in 30
years?

2521
01:52:33,371 --> 01:52:34,120
Like,
how am I,

2522
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:35,350
what is,
what is the.

2523
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,720
And I don't know,
it's a crazy journey that you've been on

2524
01:52:37,721 --> 01:52:41,080
for just four and a half years.
It's really insane

2525
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:43,443
work.

2526
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:45,980
When did it

2527
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,770
solidify in your head that you were
going to like,

2528
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:52,640
identify or like speak out as a
nonbeliever

2529
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:57,160
this morning?
I mean like,

2530
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:59,500
so I was,
I was actually talking to the same about

2531
01:52:59,501 --> 01:53:01,150
this a few months ago.
Like,

2532
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,560
because like there's,
there's,

2533
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:06,690
there's part of me that like,
I mean when I said when a lot of a lot

2534
01:53:06,691 --> 01:53:10,040
of people here jerk when they hear
atheist and uh,

2535
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:12,550
I don't use that word for myself,
atheist,

2536
01:53:12,551 --> 01:53:16,330
I don't know either.
And it's because it entails like it

2537
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:19,750
seems to bring in this idea that you're
so certain your certain,

2538
01:53:19,751 --> 01:53:21,730
there's no god,
you mock people who are religious,

2539
01:53:21,731 --> 01:53:23,700
you don't like them and all this.
And I,

2540
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,260
I,
I don't feel that like,

2541
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:30,070
and I also feel like I am,
I'm open to evidence,

2542
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:32,530
you know,
like I haven't like decided there is no

2543
01:53:32,531 --> 01:53:33,550
god.
It's like I just,

2544
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:37,750
I just don't see the evidence and so I
don't believe.

2545
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:40,960
And if there is evidence,
like I want to know,

2546
01:53:40,961 --> 01:53:41,720
like,
and again,

2547
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:44,230
I talked to religious people all the
time and I think about theology a lot.

2548
01:53:44,231 --> 01:53:45,350
I just,
I can't not like

2549
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:47,130
it also becomes,
there's a,

2550
01:53:47,131 --> 01:53:51,310
there's a group mentality involved in
atheism and there's a.

2551
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:55,620
One of the reasons why I was reluctant
to identify as an atheist is that so

2552
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:58,230
many people were asking me to identify
as an atheist.

2553
01:53:58,231 --> 01:53:59,250
I'm like,
what do you give a shit?

2554
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:02,070
Why do you want me to come out?
I told you I'm not religious,

2555
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:05,760
but
especially

2556
01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:12,270
especially the idea that there cannot be
a god or there cannot be any sort of a

2557
01:54:13,561 --> 01:54:17,190
higher power and that after you die,
it just ends.

2558
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:18,860
How do you know?

2559
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:19,611
Right,
exactly.

2560
01:54:19,611 --> 01:54:23,000
And that's exactly where I am.
It's not a knowing for certain that

2561
01:54:23,001 --> 01:54:25,400
there is no god.
I just don't.

2562
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:28,000
There's so little we know about human
life.

2563
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:32,200
Forget about the idea of possibility of
afterlife or the possibility of what

2564
01:54:32,201 --> 01:54:35,500
consciousness is there.
Possibility of what this concept that we

2565
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:37,080
call soul is.
What is,

2566
01:54:37,081 --> 01:54:40,330
what is that?
Or forget about psychedelic experiences

2567
01:54:40,331 --> 01:54:42,520
and what do they represent and what,
what,

2568
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:46,240
what do they represent when they're
coming from what essentially is human

2569
01:54:46,241 --> 01:54:50,680
neurochemistry and there's the most
potent ones are chemicals that exist in

2570
01:54:50,681 --> 01:54:52,660
the brain.
They're indogenous and the human body

2571
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:57,220
and what have those experiences and how.
Why are they so akin to religious

2572
01:54:57,221 --> 01:55:00,580
experiences and why?
Why do people even believe now,

2573
01:55:00,581 --> 01:55:05,581
especially these scholars in Jerusalem
have connected the burning Bush of Moses

2574
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:09,790
with the Acacia Bush,
which is a Bush that's rich and

2575
01:55:09,791 --> 01:55:13,510
psychedelic chemicals and they think
that it's entirely possible that Moses

2576
01:55:13,511 --> 01:55:18,370
had a psychedelic experience in which he
came back with all the laws that human

2577
01:55:18,371 --> 01:55:23,250
beings are supposed to be lifting as
proclaimed by the great spirit of the

2578
01:55:23,251 --> 01:55:24,930
universe or whatever the hell he
encountered.

2579
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,670
Like who?
Who knows?

2580
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:29,730
Who knows?
But this idea that people love to say,

2581
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:30,930
you know,
God is dead.

2582
01:55:30,931 --> 01:55:34,050
There is no god.
Like that's just as silly as saying

2583
01:55:34,051 --> 01:55:34,884
there is one.

2584
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:35,710
Right?
And,

2585
01:55:35,710 --> 01:55:38,930
and this is why like the,
like the whole process since we left,

2586
01:55:38,931 --> 01:55:41,420
like it wasn't a like.
I mean,

2587
01:55:41,421 --> 01:55:44,010
first of all,
like the idea of choosing belief system,

2588
01:55:44,011 --> 01:55:47,310
like I would like learn all this stuff
about Jehovah's Witnesses and like,

2589
01:55:47,390 --> 01:55:48,091
like,
okay,

2590
01:55:48,091 --> 01:55:49,810
yeah,
that's mostly internally consistent.

2591
01:55:49,811 --> 01:55:53,190
Like I think there's a lot of.
I never was tempted to join them or

2592
01:55:53,191 --> 01:55:54,480
whatever it actually say they're
actually,

2593
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,610
they're not,
they're not witnesses anymore.

2594
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,890
Like they,
they've,

2595
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,480
since they left a little over a couple
of years ago,

2596
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,840
do you think that you guys leaving and
having these intimate conversations with

2597
01:56:06,841 --> 01:56:08,910
them in their home might have had
something to do with the.

2598
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:10,980
I am,
we're still really good friends with

2599
01:56:10,981 --> 01:56:12,720
them.
Like there's some of my best friends.

2600
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:13,710
Um,
I don't,

2601
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:15,720
I don't think that it was that direct of
a thing.

2602
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:17,970
Part of the whole journey.

2603
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:19,380
Yeah.
I mean I think so.

2604
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:23,370
We would have these long conversations
and actually I was the craziest thing

2605
01:56:23,371 --> 01:56:27,060
when I found out that they had left,
like it was,

2606
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:28,960
it was dustin,
the Laura,

2607
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:31,730
her name is Laura.
It was her birthday and uh,

2608
01:56:32,010 --> 01:56:33,780
they don't drive,
don't celebrate birthdays.

2609
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:37,410
Like I was talking on the phone and I
didn't even know it was her birthday.

2610
01:56:37,411 --> 01:56:40,170
It's like we were talking on the phone
for over an hour and I was like telling

2611
01:56:40,171 --> 01:56:42,210
her about all this,
all these things that I'd been thinking

2612
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:44,670
about and like,
and then at the end of the conversation

2613
01:56:44,671 --> 01:56:45,840
she's like,
she's like,

2614
01:56:45,841 --> 01:56:50,280
well it's my birthday today and I'm
celebrating it.

2615
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:55,680
And I just was shocked.
I didn't say anything for a couple of

2616
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:58,020
seconds like I.
Because I obviously like knowing what

2617
01:56:58,021 --> 01:56:59,130
that.
And it was different.

2618
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,560
It wasn't as like as much for them,
you know,

2619
01:57:01,561 --> 01:57:02,970
like it wasn't the same level of.

2620
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:06,400
But like I know the disorientation and
the loss and the like,

2621
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:07,440
all of that.
It's complicated.

2622
01:57:07,441 --> 01:57:08,760
It's like you don't want to just be
like,

2623
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:10,590
oh my gosh,
I'm so glad you're out of this.

2624
01:57:10,591 --> 01:57:13,110
Because they think they believe some
things that are really kind of nuts.

2625
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:15,680
But,
but so I was just like very cautious.

2626
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:17,700
Like,
like I don't know what happened but just

2627
01:57:17,701 --> 01:57:18,590
know that.
I mean,

2628
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:21,330
I,
I've always loved and cared about them

2629
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,980
and,
and you know,

2630
01:57:22,981 --> 01:57:25,380
like,
but I was so eager to have these

2631
01:57:25,381 --> 01:57:27,600
converts to,
to understand what had happened with him

2632
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:30,330
and it's kind of just,
just following the,

2633
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:34,290
like how much internal inconsistency.
Like when you were saying earlier about

2634
01:57:34,291 --> 01:57:36,150
the,
the idea about the Bible being the

2635
01:57:36,151 --> 01:57:37,200
infallible word of God and like,
Oh,

2636
01:57:37,201 --> 01:57:39,480
that's a neat trick.
There's no way you can argue around

2637
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:40,770
that.
This is why.

2638
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:45,510
Like it's I think internal inconsistency
in the doctrines themselves.

2639
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:49,770
Like that's seems to be a really
important way to get,

2640
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:52,170
to get in,
to get through that.

2641
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:54,140
Like,
like to argue a seed of doubt.

2642
01:57:54,330 --> 01:57:56,100
Yeah.
Because that's it.

2643
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:58,380
You have to.
It's finding the inconsistency in these

2644
01:57:58,381 --> 01:58:01,770
two beliefs that allows you to maybe
question the bigger things,

2645
01:58:01,771 --> 01:58:05,290
the bigger principles and anyway,
just I think it's,

2646
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:07,320
it's important to ask the questions no
matter what you believe.

2647
01:58:07,321 --> 01:58:10,350
It's important to question and to always
be looking and examining for new

2648
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:11,520
evidence because like,
yeah,

2649
01:58:11,570 --> 01:58:14,460
you talked about this a lot,
but like confirmation bias and cognitive

2650
01:58:14,461 --> 01:58:19,461
dissonance like these,
these things that keep us locked into

2651
01:58:20,101 --> 01:58:23,640
these belief systems and impervious to
change or we're not even in previous but

2652
01:58:23,641 --> 01:58:28,530
like resistant to it.
We want to be like open and so this is,

2653
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,870
I mean,
I still try to do this and this is why,

2654
01:58:30,871 --> 01:58:31,770
like I do.

2655
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:34,170
Do you ever want to look,
grab your mom?

2656
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:37,340
You got to listen to me for an hour.
Just,

2657
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:39,960
let's talk.
I would,

2658
01:58:39,961 --> 01:58:40,920
if she,
I would love to,

2659
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,850
to her if she would listen to me,
but she,

2660
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:44,640
she just won't even look at,
you know,

2661
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:46,600
you'd be knocked on the door,
rang your doorbell.

2662
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:48,220
Uh,
that,

2663
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:49,520
that's happened a couple of times,
not me,

2664
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:52,150
my sister.
And like they close the curtain the

2665
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:53,970
window and turn off the lights inside
the.

2666
01:58:53,971 --> 01:58:56,560
Have that happened once.
But um,

2667
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:57,771
yeah,
they,

2668
01:58:57,771 --> 01:58:58,750
they,
they won't.

2669
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:02,440
And this is why it's possible.
She might hear this.

2670
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:04,840
Yeah,
she would listen to this.

2671
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,220
I think it's,
I think it's possible.

2672
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:07,030
I mean,
I think,

2673
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:09,130
I think somebody at the church,
we'll listen to it for sure.

2674
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,530
I mean,
so this is the thing like when people

2675
01:59:11,531 --> 01:59:14,080
leave,
like everything that we say most,

2676
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:16,480
any of us who leave that we say and do
publicly,

2677
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:18,400
the church pays very close attention to
it.

2678
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:20,200
Like when I was at the church I did the
same thing.

2679
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:25,060
And partly it's a like needing to know
like what they're saying so that you can

2680
01:59:25,061 --> 01:59:28,710
have a good explanation,
should counter it effectively or yeah,

2681
01:59:30,070 --> 01:59:32,320
points.
And uh,

2682
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:37,500
but so this is why another reason why it
became evident that I couldn't hide

2683
01:59:37,841 --> 01:59:41,170
forever.
Like if I hiding following the rules,

2684
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:43,310
you know,
pretending like none of this happened

2685
01:59:43,311 --> 01:59:45,670
and not causing any waves for the
church.

2686
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:49,120
That doesn't change anything.
Like the only thing that helps is,

2687
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:50,880
is talking about it like,
and,

2688
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:53,290
and,
and because here's the other thing,

2689
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:56,450
like even if I like privately in,
in letters like,

2690
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:59,440
or things that I sent to my parents or
other church members,

2691
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:02,230
like they're not gonna,
they're probably not going to share

2692
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:03,580
those with my siblings.
And if they do,

2693
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:06,070
it's going to be with a whole bunch of,
you know,

2694
02:00:06,071 --> 02:00:07,690
words against me at the same time.

2695
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:08,180
So like,
it's,

2696
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:12,260
it's only by talking publicly can,
you know,

2697
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:16,180
that's how they can actually see who you
really are and what you really think and

2698
02:00:16,181 --> 02:00:21,070
what you've really gone through without
the filter of look at what these tours

2699
02:00:21,071 --> 02:00:22,690
are doing,
things like that.

2700
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:24,700
Like it's,
it's,

2701
02:00:24,701 --> 02:00:26,710
um,
do you think your kids are,

2702
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:28,630
your brothers and sisters are going to
hear this?

2703
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:34,350
I think some of them definitely might
definitely my hope that they'll

2704
02:00:34,901 --> 02:00:38,680
eventually bolt.
I do.

2705
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:42,100
I hope that they not,
not because of any.

2706
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:46,030
I hope they can hear the reasoning and
see,

2707
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:49,390
see the consequences of what they're
doing for other people.

2708
02:00:49,391 --> 02:00:52,600
And that a lot of it,
I mean is unscriptural.

2709
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:55,030
And so even even by their own
understanding,

2710
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,550
like they,
there,

2711
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:00,940
there are things that contradict them.
I hope that they change their minds.

2712
02:01:00,941 --> 02:01:05,941
And at the very least I hope that the
church continues to moderate to not be.

2713
02:01:06,491 --> 02:01:09,280
So a lot of their new signs are things
like,

2714
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:13,060
uh,
another one of the big things for me was

2715
02:01:13,061 --> 02:01:14,470
imprecatory prayer,
right?

2716
02:01:14,471 --> 02:01:18,490
Which is this idea of this word
imprecatory to like record tour.

2717
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:22,180
So it's like the word praying for curses
for your enemies.

2718
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:23,920
Right?
Right.

2719
02:01:23,921 --> 02:01:26,440
So we did this.
You a curse against your enemies.

2720
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:27,610
Oh,
I'm often,

2721
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:28,691
yeah.
Wow.

2722
02:01:28,691 --> 02:01:31,600
That seems incredibly non Christian.
Right?

2723
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:34,240
But there's a like David King,
David.

2724
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:38,350
It is,
it's true.

2725
02:01:38,770 --> 02:01:39,591
We'll see.
This is the thing.

2726
02:01:39,591 --> 02:01:40,311
So like,
you know,

2727
02:01:40,311 --> 02:01:41,990
we,
we took that as an example for us.

2728
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:45,500
So he prayed for his enemies,
for their children to be fatherless and

2729
02:01:45,501 --> 02:01:49,220
for their wives to be widows.
And so he's praying for God to do all

2730
02:01:49,221 --> 02:01:52,910
these bad things to the Romans.
He was praying against the Romans.

2731
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:56,400
No.
Is it David the Philistines

2732
02:01:58,340 --> 02:01:59,810
and saw I guess,
but um,

2733
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,750
but,
so we took that as an example.

2734
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:05,780
Right?
So after we left,

2735
02:02:05,781 --> 02:02:10,781
I sent a is I contacted my,
it was my dad and uh,

2736
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:15,650
talked about this problem.
So like David also had a lot of wives,

2737
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,790
but we don't take his example as that.
Men should have many whys.

2738
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:23,510
And what about that and why it was
because it contradicts what Jesus and

2739
02:02:23,511 --> 02:02:26,810
the Apostle Paul said about marriage
being one man,

2740
02:02:26,811 --> 02:02:27,860
one woman for life,
right?

2741
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:30,060
So Jesus knew way,
right?

2742
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:33,290
So,
and Jesus and Paul both also said they

2743
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:36,080
talked about loving your enemies,
bless them,

2744
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:39,980
that curse you and pray for them that
despitefully use you and persecute you.

2745
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:43,220
So you're supposed to be praying for the
good of your enemies.

2746
02:02:43,221 --> 02:02:44,054
Right?
Right.

2747
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:45,780
And so it's,
it's,

2748
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:50,570
it's a contradiction.
And so anyway,

2749
02:02:50,571 --> 02:02:53,780
it's another like a long time,
like there's been a bunch of sermons

2750
02:02:53,781 --> 02:02:56,710
like,
so now my grandfather passed away almost

2751
02:02:56,810 --> 02:03:00,990
three years ago and so now there's eight
elders and they're the eight pastors in

2752
02:03:00,991 --> 02:03:02,030
my,
my dad is one of them.

2753
02:03:02,031 --> 02:03:05,960
So there's been a series of sermons on
imprecatory prayer since then.

2754
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:09,770
And they're like,
it seems like it seems so confused

2755
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:13,880
because like on the one hand there still
kind of justifying it,

2756
02:03:13,881 --> 02:03:16,670
but also it just seems like you're
trying to reconcile things that aren't

2757
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:17,504
reconcilable.

2758
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:19,280
So,
so,

2759
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:21,910
but a lot of the,
the,

2760
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:23,270
so they stopped,
I should say,

2761
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:27,710
there used to be a flyer that went out
every Friday and that used to say like,

2762
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:32,860
thank God for 15 dead soldiers,
we pray for $15,000 more and so it would

2763
02:03:33,021 --> 02:03:35,870
list all the soldiers who had died that
week.

2764
02:03:36,110 --> 02:03:37,920
And uh,
within a,

2765
02:03:37,990 --> 02:03:40,170
like after like eight months,
you know,

2766
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:42,370
my dad gave a sermon about imprecatory
prayer,

2767
02:03:42,371 --> 02:03:44,610
like at the time when I first said that,
you know,

2768
02:03:44,670 --> 02:03:47,000
there was a,
he put out a video news,

2769
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:50,240
uh,
explaining like why imprecatory prayer

2770
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:52,310
is the thing and it's supported by the
Bible.

2771
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:55,160
Eight months passed,
he gives a sermon about loving your

2772
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:58,930
enemies within a couple of weeks,
that flyer was changed.

2773
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,440
Now it doesn't say that we pray for
15,000 more.

2774
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,810
Um,
I haven't seen the first part is the

2775
02:04:04,811 --> 02:04:06,010
first part still thank God.

2776
02:04:06,030 --> 02:04:09,080
So they say because God is sovereign,
you have to thank him for everything.

2777
02:04:09,081 --> 02:04:14,030
So the fact that these for $15.
So the second part where I'm just trying

2778
02:04:14,031 --> 02:04:18,230
to say is like there,
there has been some moderation and a lot

2779
02:04:18,231 --> 02:04:23,231
of the new signs or things like be
reconciled to God and Christ our hope,

2780
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,200
things like that,
like that,

2781
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,680
that are not God hates fags.
Like those are.

2782
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:30,290
I think that's,
I think that's improvement at the very

2783
02:04:30,291 --> 02:04:32,150
least.
Even though there are still obviously

2784
02:04:32,151 --> 02:04:34,550
these,
these harsh things as well.

2785
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:38,850
So there's some adjustment and some
consideration.

2786
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:40,663
Um,
you.

2787
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:42,390
So you don't talk to your dad anymore
either,

2788
02:04:42,391 --> 02:04:44,160
right?
No one knows

2789
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:47,460
is.
Wow.

2790
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:54,530
Is there anything that you think that
you can do other than continuing to

2791
02:04:54,901 --> 02:04:59,901
speak and continuing to do what you're
doing that's going to reach them?

2792
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:03,710
So I mean I am almost finished writing a
book.

2793
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:06,050
I'm nearing the,
is it a book to them?

2794
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:10,280
It's,
it is both for them and also for,

2795
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:13,370
for other people.
There's part of the,

2796
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:16,760
kind of what I was getting at was this
like you writing a book like letters to

2797
02:05:16,761 --> 02:05:18,440
my mom and dad.
So it's not,

2798
02:05:18,470 --> 02:05:21,410
it's not,
it's not written quite that way a lot as

2799
02:05:21,411 --> 02:05:23,510
well.
I actually did consider doing it that

2800
02:05:23,511 --> 02:05:25,670
way,
but eventually ended up,

2801
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:28,240
like right now it's based on,
um,

2802
02:05:28,490 --> 02:05:31,640
each chapter is based on a relationship
that sort of brings us like the stars

2803
02:05:31,641 --> 02:05:35,540
with my mother and then my grandfather
and sort of like coming into this

2804
02:05:35,541 --> 02:05:38,600
ideology and then the process of all of
the,

2805
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:42,140
like the mental machinations of,
of leaving and like how my mind changed

2806
02:05:42,141 --> 02:05:44,480
over time and then what's happened since
we left.

2807
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,910
Like,
and I hope that by,

2808
02:05:46,970 --> 02:05:47,900
you know,
from my family,

2809
02:05:47,901 --> 02:05:50,540
I hope that by articulating these things
in,

2810
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:54,170
in a way it's like obviously we're
sitting here and even if we talk for

2811
02:05:54,171 --> 02:05:58,160
like however many hours,
like there's only so much that it's not

2812
02:05:58,161 --> 02:06:02,840
the same as having it written in a way
that's hopefully very clear and,

2813
02:06:02,990 --> 02:06:05,300
and,
and,

2814
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:09,800
and just honest to the experience,
like in as much detail and clarity with

2815
02:06:09,801 --> 02:06:12,680
as much clarity as possible.
Like I think that that's,

2816
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:17,480
I hope that that will be effective in at
least showing them that there's a

2817
02:06:17,481 --> 02:06:19,370
different way.
There are other ways of,

2818
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:23,690
of understanding these things.
And so I do hope that,

2819
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:26,030
um,
I guess I also hope,

2820
02:06:26,090 --> 02:06:28,290
like in my ted talk,
I,

2821
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:30,420
I,
I have,

2822
02:06:30,430 --> 02:06:31,550
I have,
I feel really,

2823
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:38,080
I'm like hesitant about like trying to
teach anybody anything at this point,

2824
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,280
you know what I mean?

2825
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:43,100
Like,
because I spent my whole life telling

2826
02:06:43,101 --> 02:06:45,560
other people how to live and now it'd be
like,

2827
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:48,170
well,
you guys know I got this,

2828
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,540
now I got this,
you know,

2829
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:53,570
like,
it just the idea of like,

2830
02:06:54,050 --> 02:06:58,220
insinuating even in any way that I have
something to tell people about anything.

2831
02:06:58,221 --> 02:06:59,054
Like I,
I'm,

2832
02:06:59,090 --> 02:07:01,190
I,
I really don't like that idea at all.

2833
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:04,460
And the only reason I did the Jon Ronson
actually as the one who reached out to

2834
02:07:04,461 --> 02:07:05,740
me about,
about doing it because he,

2835
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:08,330
it was a thing that he was curating an
event that he was curating,

2836
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,420
curating.
And uh,

2837
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:13,170
and so I wrote the first draft of the
talk and,

2838
02:07:13,190 --> 02:07:16,130
and the curators came back afterwards.
I was like,

2839
02:07:16,131 --> 02:07:19,850
well,
it's like this is how can we avoid the

2840
02:07:19,851 --> 02:07:23,990
mistakes that you made?
And so like I went back and like took

2841
02:07:23,991 --> 02:07:27,460
examples from David and my husband in
the way that people on twitter engage

2842
02:07:27,461 --> 02:07:28,340
me.
That actually helped,

2843
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:33,740
helped change things but so,
so it's not explicit in that way in the

2844
02:07:33,741 --> 02:07:35,980
book.
But I hope that just

2845
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,980
by talking about this and telling the
stories like I when I read accounts of

2846
02:07:41,681 --> 02:07:43,450
people who have gone through similar
situations,

2847
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:47,320
it,
it's so helpful to me like to realize

2848
02:07:47,321 --> 02:07:49,210
like my family,
like yes,

2849
02:07:49,211 --> 02:07:51,150
they man up there,
their activities are,

2850
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:54,100
are kind of,
they're extreme and they manifest

2851
02:07:54,101 --> 02:07:56,410
themselves in very strange ways to most
people.

2852
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:59,410
But they're very common,
very human flaws.

2853
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:01,480
And if,
if anything that,

2854
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:06,040
if I talk about this in a way that helps
other people see it in their own lives

2855
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:08,650
or that you know,
will resonate with people who have gone

2856
02:08:08,651 --> 02:08:11,610
through similar things like that.
I think,

2857
02:08:11,670 --> 02:08:12,230
I mean,
I,

2858
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:13,180
that's,
I want to do that.

2859
02:08:13,181 --> 02:08:18,181
I want to do as much good with these
experiences as I can because just

2860
02:08:18,551 --> 02:08:20,450
because that's how my parents raised me
honestly.

2861
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:23,580
But their argument,
of course it'd be,

2862
02:08:23,610 --> 02:08:28,140
you know,
you were so right and so convinced when

2863
02:08:28,141 --> 02:08:32,100
you were with the church.
Now you're so right and so convinced.

2864
02:08:32,101 --> 02:08:34,260
Now that you're outside of the church,
how do you know you're right now?

2865
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:37,510
The latter is not the same.
It's not the same at all.

2866
02:08:37,511 --> 02:08:40,120
Like I'm not,
I do not walk through the world with a

2867
02:08:40,121 --> 02:08:43,710
sense of what that sense of certainty
and,

2868
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:46,390
and in,
in my position and righteousness of my

2869
02:08:46,391 --> 02:08:49,950
position,
I am asking questions and I'm,

2870
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:54,460
I'm trying to explain what,
why I believe differently now than I

2871
02:08:54,461 --> 02:08:57,130
did.
I'm still asking the questions that like

2872
02:08:57,131 --> 02:08:58,690
I never stopped.
Like,

2873
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:00,340
you know what I mean?
It's,

2874
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:02,530
it's,
it's such a fundamentally different way

2875
02:09:02,531 --> 02:09:03,740
of,
of engaging.

2876
02:09:03,741 --> 02:09:03,960
Yeah.

2877
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:05,640
The world.
I do know what you mean.

2878
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:08,760
But if I was on their side and I was
trying to pick holes in your statement,

2879
02:09:08,761 --> 02:09:10,770
which is what they seem to do,
right?

2880
02:09:10,771 --> 02:09:12,360
If they're listening to the things you
say,

2881
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:16,170
they're listening to the things you say,
so they can counter them with some sort

2882
02:09:16,171 --> 02:09:19,440
of a bible quote or some sort of a more
articulate opinion.

2883
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:20,940
Right?
If I was listening,

2884
02:09:21,210 --> 02:09:23,700
I would say you were so convinced when
you with us.

2885
02:09:23,701 --> 02:09:26,250
Now you're so convinced,
but now you don't even have God.

2886
02:09:26,990 --> 02:09:27,900
How could you be?
Right?

2887
02:09:28,110 --> 02:09:30,180
So the thing is,
you're diluted the Satan,

2888
02:09:30,181 --> 02:09:32,640
the serpent scales are covering your
eyes.

2889
02:09:32,790 --> 02:09:35,670
So this a shall I thought this is
another,

2890
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:36,770
um,
another one of

2891
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:39,980
paradoxes that I realized before I left.
So there's this verse,

2892
02:09:39,981 --> 02:09:42,400
and again,
this is one that my mom make was good

2893
02:09:42,401 --> 02:09:45,910
quote all the time growing up and with
such urgency,

2894
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:48,720
like she needed us to understand this.
And,

2895
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:53,560
and the versus the heart is deceitful
above all things and desperately wicked

2896
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:55,240
who can know it,
right?

2897
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:58,630
So.
So I thought the heart was good.

2898
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:00,600
Homeless with the heart is.
No,

2899
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:03,610
I thought I fell hard is people being
sweet.

2900
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:04,850
And so

2901
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:08,150
human heart is inherently and according
to the churches inherently deceitful.

2902
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:09,590
Right?
Okay.

2903
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:14,150
But the problem is they also talk about
the heart as being like,

2904
02:10:14,151 --> 02:10:18,890
that's how we know that the Bible is
true because God puts an unction on our

2905
02:10:18,891 --> 02:10:21,020
hearts are deceitful heart.
Yes,

2906
02:10:21,021 --> 02:10:23,600
exactly.
So you're at the end of the day,

2907
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:27,800
it's always our own hearts.
Like it's our hearts that say,

2908
02:10:27,801 --> 02:10:29,810
okay,
well I'm going to follow the Bible no

2909
02:10:29,811 --> 02:10:32,240
matter no matter what.
Or in other words,

2910
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:34,310
at the end of the day,
each one of us is always

2911
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:37,370
making a decision.
It's just that for them,

2912
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:39,530
they,
they think that outsourcing it and

2913
02:10:39,531 --> 02:10:40,311
saying that,
oh no,

2914
02:10:40,311 --> 02:10:41,360
it's the Bible.
It's like,

2915
02:10:41,361 --> 02:10:42,111
well,
you're the,

2916
02:10:42,111 --> 02:10:46,220
it's your.
I tried to articulate that's on Sam's.

2917
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:47,810
Sam Harris was show a couple of years
ago,

2918
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:49,970
like,
but it's that I read it actually in his

2919
02:10:49,971 --> 02:10:51,110
book,
like that's what helps me.

2920
02:10:51,111 --> 02:10:54,230
Like it's,
it's your own moral impulses that are

2921
02:10:54,231 --> 02:10:57,620
authenticating the truth of the Bible.
Right?

2922
02:10:57,740 --> 02:11:00,530
So at the end of the day,
it's still you.

2923
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:05,120
It's still your judgment,
your judgment of your own deceitful

2924
02:11:05,121 --> 02:11:07,100
heart.
So again,

2925
02:11:07,101 --> 02:11:10,070
from their perspective.
So I guess what I'm saying now is like,

2926
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:11,780
I'm not.
When I,

2927
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,030
when I talked to my family,
when I'm addressing them,

2928
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:15,800
like it's,
it's with these questions like,

2929
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:20,810
I know how you understand these verses,
but what about these things that

2930
02:11:20,811 --> 02:11:23,960
contradict them?
I'm not saying you're wrong,

2931
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:28,490
I'm saying I can't see how you're right
because of these versus how do you do

2932
02:11:28,491 --> 02:11:28,780
this?

2933
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:32,210
Do you understand this?
What about versus the contradict other

2934
02:11:32,211 --> 02:11:35,700
verses in the Bible that the church
doesn't believe in that,

2935
02:11:35,730 --> 02:11:37,580
that,
that those contradictions exist.

2936
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,700
Talk about those contradictions,
which are pretty clear.

2937
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:42,980
What,
what do they say?

2938
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:46,130
Well,
so the Lord works in mysterious ways,

2939
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:48,930
right?
There's,

2940
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:50,470
there's always that.
Like if,

2941
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:54,260
if you think there's like for instance,
like back to the like free will and

2942
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:57,920
predestination thing that God designed
for people to go to hell and then

2943
02:11:57,921 --> 02:12:00,280
holding them responsible.
So there's this.

2944
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,370
This is a contradiction,
right?

2945
02:12:01,371 --> 02:12:04,850
This the idea that you are responsible,
right?

2946
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:08,060
Your man's responsibility and God's
sovereignty,

2947
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:11,060
they don't go together.
So it's an awesome quote.

2948
02:12:11,061 --> 02:12:16,061
Can you say that quota go man's a man's
responsibility and God's sovereignty.

2949
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:20,030
They do not go together with the quote
in the Bible.

2950
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:20,560
Oh,
I'm sorry.

2951
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:22,570
I phrased,
um,

2952
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:26,150
oh,
which is the navy o man who art thou

2953
02:12:26,151 --> 02:12:27,360
that reply against God.

2954
02:12:28,430 --> 02:12:29,263
Okay.
Yeah.

2955
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:32,720
Shall the thing formed say to him that
formed it.

2956
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:35,270
Why Hast Thou made me this?
So,

2957
02:12:35,530 --> 02:12:36,500
yeah.
So that,

2958
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:39,260
those ideas are inherently.
They're inconsistent,

2959
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,610
right?
Their contradictions.

2960
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:44,060
And so gramps,
I remember one day in church,

2961
02:12:44,061 --> 02:12:45,650
he lives gramps.
Gramps.

2962
02:12:45,651 --> 02:12:48,230
Yeah.
Sounds like such a cute name is great

2963
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:53,500
evil dude.
He could be so grandpa Tony and,

2964
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:56,330
and like,
it's so funny because like again,

2965
02:12:56,331 --> 02:12:58,220
be funny.
Oh hilarious.

2966
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:00,700
Yeah.
Sweet guy.

2967
02:13:00,990 --> 02:13:03,560
Very sweet.
He would sing the song from the forties

2968
02:13:03,561 --> 02:13:08,150
and call us my great big beautiful doll.
Like that's a huge call us and love bug.

2969
02:13:08,151 --> 02:13:09,680
And so you miss him.
Yeah.

2970
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:12,770
You,
you didn't get to see him before he died

2971
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:16,910
because you left.
Think I can talk about that.

2972
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:20,960
I can't.
Not unless you're me to start crying.

2973
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:23,230
Sorry.
Um,

2974
02:13:23,231 --> 02:13:24,140
uh,
but,

2975
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:25,273
but yeah,
he's.

2976
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:26,540
No,
no,

2977
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:30,470
no.
He was that deep for all the stuff you

2978
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:32,130
talked about.
Like you

2979
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,890
can't talk to your dad,
you can't talk to your mom,

2980
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:39,270
but something about your grandpa.
He's special.

2981
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:42,060
Yeah.
I'll tell you later.

2982
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:43,410
Okay.
Okay,

2983
02:13:43,690 --> 02:13:48,690
so in the eyes of most people,
he was the booming voice of hate for

2984
02:13:49,711 --> 02:13:51,690
sure,
and I totally understand.

2985
02:13:51,691 --> 02:13:54,600
It is not so fascinating though,
that you could see someone in an

2986
02:13:54,601 --> 02:13:57,420
intimate way you'd love them,
their family.

2987
02:13:57,421 --> 02:14:01,470
You get to see all the positive aspects
of them and yet do you get to see this

2988
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:06,530
venom that he spews out to all the world
and then that also represents you guys

2989
02:14:07,051 --> 02:14:10,860
and your family and your ideology and
your behind this powerful leader.

2990
02:14:10,861 --> 02:14:12,510
He's the founder of all this,
right?

2991
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:15,570
So essentially he's the man who created
the very bar.

2992
02:14:15,571 --> 02:14:17,310
Is that imprison your family right now?

2993
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,170
I know and it's,
it's so,

2994
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:20,880
and this is one of the things you know
after,

2995
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:24,450
after I left,
like thinking about like how did we get

2996
02:14:24,451 --> 02:14:25,480
here?
It'll,

2997
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:27,720
how did we end up in this place?

2998
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:32,610
It's an understanding of psychology or a
lack of the problem with any sort of

2999
02:14:32,611 --> 02:14:35,460
ideology,
rigid ideologies that are backed up by a

3000
02:14:35,461 --> 02:14:39,690
deity is that there can be no
questioning and as soon as there can be

3001
02:14:39,691 --> 02:14:42,630
no questioning,
you're talking about human language.

3002
02:14:42,810 --> 02:14:46,440
You're talking about something that came
obviously from the words of human

3003
02:14:46,441 --> 02:14:48,540
beings.
They wrote those words down,

3004
02:14:48,541 --> 02:14:51,510
they put them somewhere and now you're
reinforcing this ideology.

3005
02:14:51,511 --> 02:14:56,511
Anyone with even a basic understanding
of how easily influenced people are and

3006
02:14:56,581 --> 02:15:01,170
about our alpha male chimpanzee history
or lower primate history.

3007
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:05,610
We know that we're incredibly
susceptible to influence and incredibly

3008
02:15:05,611 --> 02:15:09,990
susceptible to the whims of the group
mindset and that this was imperative for

3009
02:15:09,991 --> 02:15:12,990
survival.
These tribal instincts that we have

3010
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:18,180
imperative for survival and the reason
why we made it to 2017 and that these

3011
02:15:18,721 --> 02:15:23,721
play against us in the forms of ideology
and these very rigidly reinforced

3012
02:15:24,331 --> 02:15:28,830
behavior patterns mean that is what.
That's when the problem,

3013
02:15:28,831 --> 02:15:33,831
because atheism versus people who were
deists or people who are Christian or

3014
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:37,110
Muslim or whatever the fuck it is.
It has nothing to do with that.

3015
02:15:37,111 --> 02:15:40,890
Honestly.
It's just about mind and about humans

3016
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:41,813
and about our,
our,

3017
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:45,390
our inherent tendency to give in to
these,

3018
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:50,130
these predetermined patterns of behavior
to give us comfort in these patterns

3019
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:53,640
that yeah,
there is so much comfort in certainty.

3020
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:54,720
Yeah,
I mean it's,

3021
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,730
it can be really frustrating.
All these,

3022
02:15:56,731 --> 02:15:59,190
sometimes all the rules and the like a,
like you said,

3023
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:03,300
very rigid but,
but after when I left,

3024
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:06,810
the uncertainty was just this enormous
weight.

3025
02:16:06,811 --> 02:16:10,410
Like I had no idea.
Like what do you normally wait on?

3026
02:16:10,411 --> 02:16:12,570
You just all of a sudden.
Yeah,

3027
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:14,430
because like again,
well one,

3028
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:16,800
first of all,
one of the things that makes doing

3029
02:16:16,801 --> 02:16:20,130
things like this hard or like speaking
publicly at all now that it's not like

3030
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:23,100
me,
like with God on my side or whatever is

3031
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:25,530
the idea.
Like now I'm standing on my own two

3032
02:16:25,531 --> 02:16:26,161
feet.
Like it's,

3033
02:16:26,161 --> 02:16:28,590
it's my own ideas and like who the hell
am I?

3034
02:16:28,830 --> 02:16:29,890
You know,
just that

3035
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,610
sense of like self doubt and uncertainty
and,

3036
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:36,670
and like it's,
it's just,

3037
02:16:36,671 --> 02:16:37,240
it's,
it's,

3038
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:39,400
it can be crippling sometimes,
but,

3039
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:42,640
but you just,
you have to keep going and keep asking

3040
02:16:42,641 --> 02:16:43,061
the question.
Like,

3041
02:16:43,061 --> 02:16:44,170
this is one of the things,
like you said,

3042
02:16:44,171 --> 02:16:46,990
uh,
I mean the whole another reason I don't

3043
02:16:46,991 --> 02:16:51,790
like to call myself an atheist or,
or to call myself anything actually,

3044
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:53,320
Sam,
sorry,

3045
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:55,270
I cannot stop talking about Sam Harris.
Um,

3046
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:56,680
but he had this,
uh,

3047
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:59,200
this video or he was saying,
well we shouldn't call ourselves

3048
02:16:59,201 --> 02:17:01,960
atheists or secularists or humanists
written to college.

3049
02:17:01,961 --> 02:17:06,840
So was anything we should just be good,
decent people living in the world and,

3050
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:09,040
and challenging bad ideas wherever we
find them.

3051
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:12,840
It's not about the,
I mean we want an identity like sugar,

3052
02:17:12,841 --> 02:17:15,850
crave identity and belonging in this,
like the,

3053
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:18,490
the ingroup like what you're talking
about grants,

3054
02:17:18,491 --> 02:17:21,160
like how,
how much goodness I got to see in him

3055
02:17:21,161 --> 02:17:23,170
that like people on the outside never
saw.

3056
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:24,550
It's because of that,
you know,

3057
02:17:24,551 --> 02:17:26,970
the Ingroup outgroup mentality.
Like the bar,

3058
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:28,540
like I said earlier,
that bonds that are forged there.

3059
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:31,150
It's so,
it's so enticing,

3060
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:33,460
but,
but it comes at a,

3061
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:37,510
at a huge cost and I didn't see that
cost for a long time,

3062
02:17:37,570 --> 02:17:40,930
so now this is another reason I don't.
I just don't like those labels.

3063
02:17:40,931 --> 02:17:45,130
It's not about the identity.
It's just about trying to find the best

3064
02:17:45,131 --> 02:17:48,640
way we can to live in the world and do
as much good as we can.

3065
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:51,930
I think there are bumps in the road and
the evolution of culture.

3066
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:55,620
I think that's what they are or think we
haven't figured out how dangerous they

3067
02:17:55,621 --> 02:17:59,760
are and that we fall prey to them,
but they're also the reason why we got

3068
02:17:59,761 --> 02:18:02,700
here in the first place because we did
figure out these ways to bond together

3069
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:05,850
and we did figure out these ways to
identify with each other in this very

3070
02:18:05,851 --> 02:18:08,700
extreme,
a very personal way and if it wasn't for

3071
02:18:08,701 --> 02:18:11,730
those things,
who knows if we would have ever made it

3072
02:18:11,731 --> 02:18:13,110
this far,
who knows,

3073
02:18:13,111 --> 02:18:17,430
but they've also also been able to.
People have been able to rationalize

3074
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:21,360
horrific acts through the use of this us
versus them.

3075
02:18:21,450 --> 02:18:22,320
You know,
the,

3076
02:18:22,321 --> 02:18:27,321
our group versus the other.
It's a very strange aspect of what I

3077
02:18:27,601 --> 02:18:32,601
believe is the adolescent nature of
human social and cultural evolution,

3078
02:18:33,301 --> 02:18:34,590
which is where we're at right now.

3079
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:37,200
We've come so far we think,
but really we haven't.

3080
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:40,560
We haven't really been around that long.
I mean they're talking about this in

3081
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:43,530
this modern human being.
They found 300,000 years ago,

3082
02:18:43,770 --> 02:18:44,603
God,
that's a blip,

3083
02:18:44,790 --> 02:18:47,280
blip.
So it's a blink of an eye in terms of

3084
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:49,920
the history of the world.
Nevermind the history of the universe.

3085
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:54,720
And I think that it's very dangerous
when someone tells you they know it's

3086
02:18:54,721 --> 02:18:56,490
very dangerous because you don't know.
And she's like,

3087
02:18:56,491 --> 02:18:57,330
well,
if they know,

3088
02:18:57,480 --> 02:19:00,000
I'll just listen to them.
And that's what we've been doing forever

3089
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:05,730
and I think people are recognizing more
and more now that that is,

3090
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,410
that's not safe.
It's dangerous and it's an impediment to

3091
02:19:10,411 --> 02:19:12,630
progress,
personal progress,

3092
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:17,460
progress as a community,
we have just as insane instinct to join

3093
02:19:17,461 --> 02:19:20,520
teams to the point where people,
they identify with certain patches,

3094
02:19:20,521 --> 02:19:21,900
a dirt.
I'm a Texan,

3095
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:22,741
like,
oh,

3096
02:19:22,741 --> 02:19:24,720
you're a Texan,
so this is all okay,

3097
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:25,591
you know,
hey,

3098
02:19:25,591 --> 02:19:26,970
I'm from New York.
Oh,

3099
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:29,030
from New York.
Well that while I get you,

3100
02:19:29,031 --> 02:19:32,060
now I understand you.
You're in this nice little category.

3101
02:19:32,450 --> 02:19:35,420
You get to operate on these
predetermined patterns.

3102
02:19:35,421 --> 02:19:37,970
Now you know you've.
You don't even have to have your own

3103
02:19:37,971 --> 02:19:41,300
beliefs.
You just adopt a conglomeration of

3104
02:19:41,301 --> 02:19:45,080
beliefs that fit whatever category you
fall into with your left wing

3105
02:19:45,081 --> 02:19:47,510
progressive or a right wing
conservative.

3106
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:50,840
So we're.
We're really weird.

3107
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:55,490
Really Weird.
Monkey were so strange and we're also

3108
02:19:55,491 --> 02:19:56,750
aware how weird we are.

3109
02:19:56,750 --> 02:19:58,490
That's what I was going to say like that
is the,

3110
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:02,090
that's where I feel so much and why I
feel so much hope,

3111
02:20:02,091 --> 02:20:05,000
right?
Because like the more awareness we have,

3112
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:09,440
the better we can go about trying to
sort of shore those things up.

3113
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:12,380
Yeah.
I could see the pitfalls and then try to

3114
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:13,520
find ways around them,

3115
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:16,680
but it takes people like you that
incredibly courageous,

3116
02:20:16,681 --> 02:20:19,820
that breakout of the pattern and,
and,

3117
02:20:20,250 --> 02:20:24,780
and just paddle out into the waters of
discomfort because that's what people

3118
02:20:24,781 --> 02:20:28,200
have a really hard time doing.
People have a really hard time changing.

3119
02:20:28,530 --> 02:20:30,330
They have a really hard time taking
chances.

3120
02:20:30,331 --> 02:20:34,710
They were really hard time doing new
things and you did all of it at once in

3121
02:20:34,711 --> 02:20:38,250
one big burst and you separated from
your tribe.

3122
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:41,250
It was so important to you that you
separated from your tribe.

3123
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,050
That's so hard.

3124
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:44,780
Yeah.
Yeah,

3125
02:20:44,781 --> 02:20:46,770
for sure.
But it's.

3126
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:48,770
And this is one of those things where
like,

3127
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:52,550
I mean,
I was talking to David after I left

3128
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:57,640
before the delicious festival.
You're sitting in the home of this rabbi

3129
02:20:57,650 --> 02:21:00,350
that I had protested earlier and,
and uh,

3130
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:03,020
your rabbi as a horror was decided.
My sister held and like,

3131
02:21:03,050 --> 02:21:05,030
oh no,
like living with this rabbi.

3132
02:21:05,031 --> 02:21:06,150
Right.
Actually,

3133
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:07,230
that's why I'm staying right here.
Well,

3134
02:21:07,231 --> 02:21:08,960
I'm here.
You're staying with a rabbi,

3135
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:12,050
rabbi and his wife and their four kids.
How is a rabbi,

3136
02:21:12,051 --> 02:21:16,700
a whore that you,
that you pay them and they make you feel

3137
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:18,110
good?
Like they tell you what you want to

3138
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:19,070
hear,
that

3139
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:20,980
it makes him a whore.
In that case,

3140
02:21:20,981 --> 02:21:23,930
is a comedian a whore too?
I must be a whore.

3141
02:21:23,970 --> 02:21:25,070
Yeah,
probably.

3142
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:28,130
Yeah.
They're committing whoredom

3143
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:31,150
prostitution.
But David said,

3144
02:21:31,151 --> 02:21:32,690
we'll give him massages.
Whores.

3145
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:38,920
I wouldn't go there,
but they're making you feel good and you

3146
02:21:41,670 --> 02:21:44,300
pay them to you.
It's like,

3147
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:47,660
okay,
so chiropractors would be horse.

3148
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:50,290
Is that how it works?
I guess

3149
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:53,200
David was like,
um,

3150
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:57,830
it's like you are your parents children.
Like I'm just like sitting there bawling

3151
02:21:57,950 --> 02:22:01,760
and because I felt like such a betrayer,
this is again right after we left.

3152
02:22:01,761 --> 02:22:03,320
And uh,
and he said,

3153
02:22:03,410 --> 02:22:04,430
I said,
what do you mean?

3154
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:05,661
He said,
well,

3155
02:22:05,661 --> 02:22:08,390
they're the ones who taught you to stand
up for what you believe in no matter

3156
02:22:08,391 --> 02:22:10,520
what it costs you.
And so I,

3157
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:12,920
I,
I love that idea,

3158
02:22:12,921 --> 02:22:17,780
like that there's still so much from
home that I have held onto and that,

3159
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:21,590
that still guides me.
It's just that I obviously had to,

3160
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:24,320
it's just the,
the things that I now think are

3161
02:22:24,321 --> 02:22:27,660
destructive and hurtful and just not
true,

3162
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:29,520
not,
not consistent with reality.

3163
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:31,520
Um,
but that,

3164
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:32,960
that gave me a lot of,
like,

3165
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:34,830
a lot of hope.
Right?

3166
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:37,223
Well,
you,

3167
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:40,830
you definitely seek comfort and ancient
wisdom and quotes.

3168
02:22:41,170 --> 02:22:42,003
Who Me?
Yeah,

3169
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:44,150
well it's hard.
Like here's the thing,

3170
02:22:44,151 --> 02:22:46,400
like it's.
So I remember I was,

3171
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:50,810
there's a New Yorker article that came
out at the end of 2015 and so I was

3172
02:22:50,811 --> 02:22:52,820
doing interviews with the writer Adrian
Chen,

3173
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:55,100
who's amazing and he's an amazing
writer.

3174
02:22:55,130 --> 02:22:56,750
Just just generally,
not that just that article,

3175
02:22:56,751 --> 02:22:59,470
but like as we're having these
conversations like,

3176
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:02,330
like we,
I think we spent three days together in

3177
02:23:02,331 --> 02:23:06,920
Kansas talking about maybe six hours at
a time and then on on the phone like

3178
02:23:06,921 --> 02:23:08,930
three and four hour conversations
regularly.

3179
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:13,370
Like it was so much like trying to
really get across all of these all of

3180
02:23:13,371 --> 02:23:16,880
this time to really understand exactly
how my mind changed all the details in

3181
02:23:16,881 --> 02:23:17,714
the church,
whatever,

3182
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:20,990
like and at one point like we're talking
and,

3183
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:23,690
and he asked me a question,
it was about the soldier's funeral I

3184
02:23:23,691 --> 02:23:24,260
think.

3185
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:27,970
And I just immediately started like
coding all these verses and like.

3186
02:23:27,971 --> 02:23:31,370
And it's like Whoa,
you just went into this mode.

3187
02:23:31,430 --> 02:23:33,910
Like I can tell this is just like this,
like switching into this like,

3188
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,210
like,
like it had been at the church.

3189
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:38,120
Like it's just not possible.
Like even though I think that I don't

3190
02:23:38,121 --> 02:23:39,950
believe the Bible is the infallible word
of God,

3191
02:23:40,310 --> 02:23:44,610
but like I spent so much time like
reading it and learning it and

3192
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:47,270
memorizing you know,
chapters at a time with my family and

3193
02:23:47,271 --> 02:23:48,104
all this stuff.
So it's like,

3194
02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:50,480
it's right there.
It's always like.

3195
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:52,880
And they're like I said,
there is so much good in it.

3196
02:23:52,881 --> 02:23:54,790
So it's like,
I dunno,

3197
02:23:54,830 --> 02:23:56,320
it's just.
I know what you're saying is that,

3198
02:23:56,340 --> 02:23:56,801
that are,
it's,

3199
02:23:56,801 --> 02:23:59,870
it's comforting when you said it's a,
it sounds so foreign to hear the King

3200
02:23:59,871 --> 02:24:01,250
James,
but like to me it was just.

3201
02:24:01,310 --> 02:24:02,870
Sorry.
It's comforting.

3202
02:24:02,930 --> 02:24:04,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

3203
02:24:04,550 --> 02:24:06,160
And it's,
it's familiar and it's.

3204
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:07,580
And it's,
it's a part,

3205
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:10,820
it's a part of my home and my upbringing
that I,

3206
02:24:11,210 --> 02:24:12,043
that I can keep

3207
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:17,330
as a person outside of it.
Looking at it when someone starts

3208
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:22,450
spouting out biblical phrases and terms
and using these parables and using these

3209
02:24:24,891 --> 02:24:29,891
stories and passages in the Bible to
justify things and then equating like

3210
02:24:30,261 --> 02:24:33,440
certain aspects of modern thinking and
behavior to those things.

3211
02:24:33,770 --> 02:24:37,550
To me it's almost like I'm looking at
mathematics that I don't totally

3212
02:24:37,551 --> 02:24:38,870
understand.
It's like,

3213
02:24:38,871 --> 02:24:40,040
I see what you're doing,
you're putting,

3214
02:24:40,090 --> 02:24:44,510
you're plugging this equation in to
achieve a desired result and this result

3215
02:24:44,570 --> 02:24:46,290
is um,
a,

3216
02:24:46,330 --> 02:24:49,190
a peace of mind,
peace of mind is what you're looking to

3217
02:24:49,191 --> 02:24:53,150
attain and you're looking to attain
justification for your lifestyle and

3218
02:24:53,151 --> 02:24:56,000
actions.
And you can do so with this quote,

3219
02:24:56,180 --> 02:24:58,190
which is essentially like you're,
you're,

3220
02:24:58,191 --> 02:25:00,650
you're plugging in some sort of
theoretical physics.

3221
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:03,080
I mean,
it's a weird stretch of what I'm saying.

3222
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:05,300
What I'm saying is just like the feeling
of it,

3223
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:07,190
the feeling of it is like,
oh,

3224
02:25:07,191 --> 02:25:07,870
I don't lie.

3225
02:25:07,870 --> 02:25:09,530
This will.
Then you use this.

3226
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:12,350
Oh,
and then is that okay and makes this.

3227
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:17,380
So it's all these little tools in order
to operate the mind on a more harmonious

3228
02:25:18,621 --> 02:25:22,010
frequency for your own personal
satisfaction and your,

3229
02:25:22,011 --> 02:25:27,011
your feeling of happiness and peace.
Like you can feel comfort in the fact

3230
02:25:27,611 --> 02:25:32,110
that you have quoted the Bible verses
that explain your behavior correctly.

3231
02:25:32,220 --> 02:25:34,930
You have made the noises in the right
order.

3232
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:36,870
Yeah.
And whether or not those noises make

3233
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:39,850
sense at all.
And then when in doubt,

3234
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:45,060
you throw in like some weird principle
like that God has a plan for everything,

3235
02:25:46,031 --> 02:25:49,910
so fuck you doubts,
you just stick that right in there and

3236
02:25:49,911 --> 02:25:50,744
like,
okay good.

3237
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:55,900
So that's like dark matter.
Well where's all the mass dark matter

3238
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:56,830
where you go,
oh,

3239
02:25:56,850 --> 02:25:58,110
okay.
You know what I'm saying though?

3240
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:01,310
He gets like,
it's an odd sort of a thing because it's

3241
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:02,333
the,

3242
02:26:02,670 --> 02:26:05,470
just the uncertainty and the lack of
knowledge,

3243
02:26:05,471 --> 02:26:07,420
like you don't understand.
It's something I don't understand.

3244
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:08,920
It's okay.
It'll have to understand it because

3245
02:26:08,921 --> 02:26:10,090
somebody else understands it.

3246
02:26:10,170 --> 02:26:11,940
Also,
you're using tools.

3247
02:26:12,210 --> 02:26:16,380
It's also like you're using these,
these phrases and these tools and these

3248
02:26:16,381 --> 02:26:21,381
passages to achieve desired results
internally as well as externally.

3249
02:26:23,161 --> 02:26:23,540
You're,
you're,

3250
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:27,540
you're using them to comfort yourself,
but you're also using them to,

3251
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:29,640
to prove your point against these
others.

3252
02:26:29,830 --> 02:26:34,260
And that's a big part of what's going on
with this whole tribalism cult like

3253
02:26:34,261 --> 02:26:37,950
behavior.
It's justifying your own patterns of

3254
02:26:37,951 --> 02:26:41,670
thinking by demonizing and marginalizing
others.

3255
02:26:41,810 --> 02:26:43,400
Patterns of thinking.
Yes.

3256
02:26:43,401 --> 02:26:44,590
Okay.
So this is something that I,

3257
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:47,060
I missed this for a long time too,
but like,

3258
02:26:47,061 --> 02:26:49,370
so my grandfather,
like I think I said earlier,

3259
02:26:49,371 --> 02:26:52,000
maybe the Christians were some of the
biggest targets at the church and I

3260
02:26:52,001 --> 02:26:54,330
spent so much time,
uh,

3261
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:56,330
like the minor differences.
Yes,

3262
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:58,640
exactly.
But I mean even like major differences,

3263
02:26:58,641 --> 02:27:00,240
like the hatred of God and you know,
like,

3264
02:27:00,770 --> 02:27:02,750
and you know,
people going to hell for eternity and,

3265
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:04,490
and,
and why and all these things like,

3266
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:09,940
like we spent so much time,
grams would instead of saying we are the

3267
02:27:10,551 --> 02:27:11,930
only ones who have it,
right?

3268
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:16,010
Westboro Baptist church is the only true
church in the entire world and I'm 100

3269
02:27:16,011 --> 02:27:18,710
percent certain of that.
It was a different strategy.

3270
02:27:18,711 --> 02:27:21,590
It was attacking every other version of
Christianity,

3271
02:27:21,591 --> 02:27:25,910
every other understanding of the Bible.
And so,

3272
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:28,970
and it's like by default it's like,
well you know exactly why all these

3273
02:27:28,971 --> 02:27:31,940
people are wrong.
Methodists and Catholics and whatever.

3274
02:27:32,210 --> 02:27:35,180
Like,
and you can articulate chapter in verse

3275
02:27:35,181 --> 02:27:37,790
why they're all wrong and therefore the
end,

3276
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:41,810
like it becomes clear like we are right
and we are the only ones who are right

3277
02:27:41,990 --> 02:27:44,210
and everybody else is.
So it's just this.

3278
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:47,510
It's so frustrating.

3279
02:27:49,700 --> 02:27:52,160
So frustrating.
Well,

3280
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:54,830
I hate to use the word,
but it just,

3281
02:27:54,860 --> 02:27:59,690
it lacks enlightenment because it's
dealing with conflict and it's dealing

3282
02:27:59,691 --> 02:28:00,620
with finger pointing.

3283
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:06,110
It's dealing with insults like just the,
the term fags God hates fags is using

3284
02:28:06,111 --> 02:28:08,180
that.
Like that in itself.

3285
02:28:08,210 --> 02:28:12,830
It's just like a giant red flag showing
the errors of your thinking in order to

3286
02:28:12,831 --> 02:28:17,620
even sit down and draw this poster.
Like do like this is,

3287
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:21,680
this is not God's approach.
If there is a god the Bible,

3288
02:28:21,681 --> 02:28:24,410
I mean if there is a god that's in
charge of this whole thing and he's

3289
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:27,130
filled with love and he has a plan for
us all.

3290
02:28:27,430 --> 02:28:30,980
Do you get super emotional when you're
talking about this stuff that you see?

3291
02:28:30,981 --> 02:28:32,250
You're all worked up.
Sorry.

3292
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:33,141
No,
no,

3293
02:28:33,141 --> 02:28:34,910
don't apologize.
It's important.

3294
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:35,601
Look,
I mean,

3295
02:28:35,601 --> 02:28:39,410
it's amazing how well you keep it
together without contact with your mom

3296
02:28:39,411 --> 02:28:43,850
and your dad and your brothers and
sisters and it's been four years.

3297
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:45,380
How long enough?
Yeah.

3298
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:46,423
Yeah.

3299
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:49,410
Um,
well I totally lost my train of thought

3300
02:28:49,411 --> 02:28:50,244
there.
Okay.

3301
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:52,500
You said something.

3302
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,770
Well,
I was talking about just that,

3303
02:28:54,990 --> 02:28:56,900
the,
the insults and this.

3304
02:28:57,490 --> 02:28:59,040
Yeah,
so like the way,

3305
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:04,100
like I always say people don't,
it's not the method that's the problem.

3306
02:29:04,441 --> 02:29:06,840
It's the message.
It doesn't matter how we say the

3307
02:29:06,841 --> 02:29:08,910
message.
People are still going to hate it.

3308
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:09,960
Like if you,
if you say,

3309
02:29:09,990 --> 02:29:10,711
you know,
God created,

3310
02:29:10,711 --> 02:29:15,060
most people go to hell and we're were
among the only ones going to heaven and

3311
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:15,960
sorry,
suckers,

3312
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:18,000
you know,
like people hate that message,

3313
02:29:18,001 --> 02:29:21,240
right?
People hate the idea that you have to

3314
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:25,530
like follow this set of rules.
Like you can't just live the way you

3315
02:29:25,531 --> 02:29:28,470
want to live.
You have to obey these ideas as we

3316
02:29:28,471 --> 02:29:30,240
understand them.
I'm like,

3317
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:32,220
people don't like that message.
They don't want you telling them what to

3318
02:29:32,221 --> 02:29:34,080
do.
So that we would always make that

3319
02:29:34,081 --> 02:29:35,520
argument.
And then of course,

3320
02:29:35,521 --> 02:29:36,570
and you know,
after,

3321
02:29:36,571 --> 02:29:38,130
when I was thinking about leaving,
it was like,

3322
02:29:38,550 --> 02:29:41,100
of course it matters how you talk to
people.

3323
02:29:41,130 --> 02:29:44,310
Of course it does and even the Bible
talks about it.

3324
02:29:44,311 --> 02:29:45,390
So like,
you know,

3325
02:29:45,391 --> 02:29:48,380
in the New Testament Paul talks about,
you know,

3326
02:29:48,390 --> 02:29:52,320
to the Jews I became as a Jew and to the
Greeks as a Greek and do you know,

3327
02:29:52,321 --> 02:29:56,880
to the weak I became as weak because if
the idea is like you understand your

3328
02:29:56,881 --> 02:30:00,480
audience and who you're talking to and
you're actually trying to reach them,

3329
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:03,350
you're not just self righteously,
you know,

3330
02:30:03,460 --> 02:30:06,660
proclaiming this thing and saying get on
board or you're doomed.

3331
02:30:06,690 --> 02:30:07,523
Like it's,
it's,

3332
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:10,030
there's,
there was no we had and we,

3333
02:30:10,050 --> 02:30:12,510
we sometimes could have those arguments
one on one.

3334
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:14,820
But like you know,
when we go out to these protests were

3335
02:30:14,821 --> 02:30:18,600
saying these things and it's so
provocative and inflammatory and we knew

3336
02:30:18,601 --> 02:30:23,601
it and we just did it anyway because we
thought it was justified as long as it

3337
02:30:23,731 --> 02:30:24,300
was true.

3338
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:27,750
And it didn't matter how we set it or
when we set it or to whom we said it

3339
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:29,580
well,
it was a grieving widow or a,

3340
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:32,670
you know,
a child whose father had just died or

3341
02:30:32,671 --> 02:30:34,590
parents whose children had just died.
It's just,

3342
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:36,660
it's,
it's insane to me now.

3343
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:40,190
I can't,
I have a hard time like so,

3344
02:30:40,270 --> 02:30:41,940
so much of my history,
my past,

3345
02:30:41,941 --> 02:30:44,130
like I know why I believed what I
believed.

3346
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:47,070
But sometimes that when I see these,
these contradictions,

3347
02:30:47,071 --> 02:30:50,430
I think,
what was I thinking when we were reading

3348
02:30:50,431 --> 02:30:52,350
these verses?
And I,

3349
02:30:52,380 --> 02:30:54,120
I don't,
I can't think of what they could be

3350
02:30:54,121 --> 02:30:57,840
thinking now except that it's just that
cognitive dissonance that just,

3351
02:30:57,870 --> 02:31:00,240
just,
just going past it and was like,

3352
02:31:00,241 --> 02:31:01,051
oh yeah,
that sounds good.

3353
02:31:01,051 --> 02:31:03,030
But like not seeing.
And you know,

3354
02:31:03,031 --> 02:31:04,440
there's another verse that talks about,
uh,

3355
02:31:04,590 --> 02:31:05,101
uh,
deceived,

3356
02:31:05,101 --> 02:31:06,160
hardest,
turned them Messiah.

3357
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:09,390
So he can't even say,
is there not a lie in my right hand?

3358
02:31:09,750 --> 02:31:10,400
Like,
that's,

3359
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:12,660
that's the feeling that I have.
Sorry,

3360
02:31:12,661 --> 02:31:14,850
back to the quoting her.
Great.

3361
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:15,960
Great.
Yeah.

3362
02:31:16,530 --> 02:31:17,640
But anyway,
it's just,

3363
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:22,260
this is why I think you're uniquely
qualified to sort of translate those.

3364
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,513
And I,
I,

3365
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:24,510
and that's the thing,
like,

3366
02:31:24,511 --> 02:31:25,330
I,
that's,

3367
02:31:25,330 --> 02:31:26,800
that's why I keep,
I mean,

3368
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:29,130
I want to keep asking the questions.
It's not just about,

3369
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:31,980
you know,
I think my family feels they feel

3370
02:31:31,981 --> 02:31:34,590
attacked.
I'm sure when I talk about this and why

3371
02:31:34,591 --> 02:31:37,710
I don't believe it and you know,
when I send these messages on twitter

3372
02:31:37,970 --> 02:31:40,830
and I remember what that felt like,
you know,

3373
02:31:40,831 --> 02:31:44,490
hearing people,
people that I had loved speak against

3374
02:31:44,491 --> 02:31:46,950
these doctrines and values that I held
so,

3375
02:31:47,010 --> 02:31:48,190
so dear.
Um,

3376
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:51,820
but I,
it's not because I'm trying to hurt them

3377
02:31:51,821 --> 02:31:54,570
more or embarrass them or humiliate
them.

3378
02:31:54,571 --> 02:31:56,790
It's because I,
I want to help them see.

3379
02:31:57,850 --> 02:32:00,750
And if,
if I'm wrong about something then I want

3380
02:32:00,751 --> 02:32:01,950
to know that too.
So it's just,

3381
02:32:01,951 --> 02:32:04,920
it's always this like openness to change
into,

3382
02:32:05,730 --> 02:32:07,740
into,
I don't know,

3383
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:08,633
finding a better way.

3384
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:12,520
One of the things you did that's
incredibly brave is not just leave,

3385
02:32:12,970 --> 02:32:16,960
but when you change your thinking and
change,

3386
02:32:16,990 --> 02:32:20,050
you have to admit that you fucked up big
time.

3387
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:25,000
I have to admit that your entire life
has been essentially about propagating a

3388
02:32:25,001 --> 02:32:25,660
lie.

3389
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:27,600
[inaudible].
There was a,

3390
02:32:28,350 --> 02:32:33,350
I had to say no weird Al Yankovic.
Here's a song that I'm listening to.

3391
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:40,200
Everything you know is wrong.
Up Up is down,

3392
02:32:40,201 --> 02:32:44,470
black is wide and short as long as I
remember like in this process of like,

3393
02:32:44,490 --> 02:32:45,360
you know,
before we left,

3394
02:32:45,361 --> 02:32:47,890
like remembering that and being like,
I cannot,

3395
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,830
I just thought of a weird Al Song.
But yeah,

3396
02:32:49,831 --> 02:32:54,831
that's totally what it just,
just coming to terms with like how,

3397
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:57,490
how,
how wrong and how,

3398
02:32:57,500 --> 02:33:02,430
how could this have been for my entire
life and how can I possibly face this

3399
02:33:02,431 --> 02:33:05,820
like in my own mind,
let alone to all of these people.

3400
02:33:06,100 --> 02:33:08,970
I did it in front of the,
like in front of the whole world,

3401
02:33:09,050 --> 02:33:11,220
you know,
anybody who had seen like all the

3402
02:33:11,221 --> 02:33:13,710
documentaries,
all the times that I had so publicly

3403
02:33:13,711 --> 02:33:16,890
defended all these ideas and now
realizing like,

3404
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:19,610
how can I possibly faced that?
Right.

3405
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:22,120
If you were ever running for office as
the first thing that you go out,

3406
02:33:22,210 --> 02:33:26,090
look at Phelps in 2003 and the horrible
thing she was.

3407
02:33:27,310 --> 02:33:28,440
That's what they do,
right?

3408
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:29,323
Yeah.
Yeah.

3409
02:33:29,550 --> 02:33:30,383
Well,
I think

3410
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:33,170
your.
Your ability to say that you,

3411
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:37,670
you don't agree with what you used to do
and you are a different person now is so

3412
02:33:37,671 --> 02:33:41,000
important for people to hear is one of
the most important things I think you're

3413
02:33:41,001 --> 02:33:44,930
saying because people feel so imprisoned
by their past.

3414
02:33:45,440 --> 02:33:50,440
It's a huge problem with human beings
that you repeat sort of the same

3415
02:33:50,691 --> 02:33:53,810
patterns of behavior because even if
they're wrong,

3416
02:33:53,811 --> 02:33:57,260
there's comfort and there's comfort in
going back to those cigarettes.

3417
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:59,420
There's comfort in,
in binge eating.

3418
02:33:59,421 --> 02:34:01,730
Again,
there's comfort in gambling because I

3419
02:34:01,731 --> 02:34:04,340
know this.
I know this crazy rush of trying to find

3420
02:34:04,341 --> 02:34:05,630
crack.
I'm going for it.

3421
02:34:05,960 --> 02:34:10,960
I mean there's a lot of weirdness in,
in human behavior patterns and what

3422
02:34:11,301 --> 02:34:16,301
you've done is not just have real
intellectual courage to just actually

3423
02:34:18,221 --> 02:34:22,780
challenge your own personal thought
processes and ideas and look deep into

3424
02:34:22,781 --> 02:34:25,600
these scriptures that you've been
following your whole life and find these

3425
02:34:25,601 --> 02:34:27,490
contradictions,
explore these contradictions,

3426
02:34:27,730 --> 02:34:31,720
contradictions and try to debate them.
But also just to just to come out and

3427
02:34:31,721 --> 02:34:35,380
say like I was making just big mistakes.

3428
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:39,150
I think it's really hard to say.
I mean a lot of things but,

3429
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:41,590
but two things just for people in
general.

3430
02:34:41,710 --> 02:34:43,540
Like I messed up.
Yeah.

3431
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:48,520
And I don't know,
like we have to be able to.

3432
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:52,510
I mean,
I think to be able to an honestly like

3433
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:55,960
this is another thing.
Like there's so much freedom in that.

3434
02:34:55,961 --> 02:34:58,120
In both of those ideas.
Like I said earlier,

3435
02:34:58,121 --> 02:35:00,340
like certainty.
There's so much comfort and certainty.

3436
02:35:00,341 --> 02:35:03,640
Like you don't have to wonder,
you don't have to doubt,

3437
02:35:03,641 --> 02:35:06,910
you don't have to question.
You can just go on your way and know

3438
02:35:06,911 --> 02:35:09,610
that what you're doing is exactly right.
And like,

3439
02:35:09,611 --> 02:35:11,020
there's so much comfort there,
but,

3440
02:35:11,350 --> 02:35:14,440
but in my experience,
it's a false certainty.

3441
02:35:14,441 --> 02:35:16,480
It's a false comfort because you're,
you're,

3442
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:19,390
you're going along if you're not,
if you're not examining,

3443
02:35:19,391 --> 02:35:23,050
if you're not taking in new evidence,
if you're not like saying,

3444
02:35:23,051 --> 02:35:25,750
I don't know,
it's like I don't have to have all the

3445
02:35:25,751 --> 02:35:27,790
answers.
I can just say like,

3446
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:29,920
I'm doing my best.
This is where I'm at now.

3447
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:32,350
Like I'm,
I'm sure I'm gonna like find something,

3448
02:35:32,910 --> 02:35:34,360
I'm fine,
I'm going to find something else that

3449
02:35:34,361 --> 02:35:36,430
I'm at,
I've got wrong now and I'm going to keep

3450
02:35:36,431 --> 02:35:38,620
trying to get.
I'm going to keep trying to get better.

3451
02:35:38,621 --> 02:35:40,930
Like you don't want to become this
static,

3452
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:42,150
you know,
you want to be able to,

3453
02:35:42,190 --> 02:35:46,330
to grow and learn and understand and do
better and as many ways as you can.

3454
02:35:46,530 --> 02:35:50,620
You're wrestling constantly with a
dangerous and volatile factor.

3455
02:35:50,790 --> 02:35:52,630
And that's uncertainty.
Yep.

3456
02:35:52,690 --> 02:35:56,020
And that is what people try to avoid
that soccer as much as they can.

3457
02:35:56,021 --> 02:35:57,490
Like I don't want that.

3458
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:59,520
Right.
And just like learning to be comfortable

3459
02:35:59,521 --> 02:36:02,190
there.
Like I exist here and I exist in this

3460
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:06,120
uncertain space because it's honest.
I don't know.

3461
02:36:06,210 --> 02:36:09,760
I don't have to know.
I can keep trying to understand and,

3462
02:36:09,761 --> 02:36:11,050
and you know,
so it's,

3463
02:36:11,330 --> 02:36:14,210
that's why one of the most,
the weakest things you could ever see in

3464
02:36:14,211 --> 02:36:19,211
a person is a person talking about
something in a way where like you ask

3465
02:36:20,661 --> 02:36:24,560
them a question about something and they
don't really know and they try to

3466
02:36:24,561 --> 02:36:26,870
pretend they do start to pontificate.
Yeah.

3467
02:36:26,871 --> 02:36:28,730
What you see it instead of saying,
God,

3468
02:36:28,731 --> 02:36:30,080
I don't know,
is that true?

3469
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:35,260
Instead or instead of being like open to
the possibility of anything being

3470
02:36:36,531 --> 02:36:38,240
outside of the realm of their
understanding,

3471
02:36:38,270 --> 02:36:41,270
they double down,
double down on their ignorance or they

3472
02:36:41,271 --> 02:36:44,630
avoided at all costs and you see
literally see like the little,

3473
02:36:44,810 --> 02:36:46,670
the ban in the machinery,
the ego.

3474
02:36:46,671 --> 02:36:50,270
Just yanking on the gears frantically.
You could see it.

3475
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:53,240
We all recognize it.
It's one of the more fascinating things

3476
02:36:53,241 --> 02:36:57,800
to me about religion in general is that
there we have this incredible desire to

3477
02:36:57,801 --> 02:37:00,050
become a part of a group.
I mean everybody does.

3478
02:37:00,051 --> 02:37:05,051
We find comfort in these groups,
but we also can see the gears spinning

3479
02:37:05,690 --> 02:37:10,340
when someone does agree with something
or someone does say something that

3480
02:37:10,341 --> 02:37:13,300
resonates or or so when someone says
something that's contradictory,

3481
02:37:13,310 --> 02:37:17,120
we see the gear spinning,
we that this is all some sort of a weird

3482
02:37:17,121 --> 02:37:19,630
cognitive dance that we're doing to try
to make,

3483
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:25,150
make sense out of this temporary
existence on a planet hurling through

3484
02:37:25,581 --> 02:37:26,414
infinity

3485
02:37:26,550 --> 02:37:27,383
[inaudible].

3486
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:29,300
It's insane.
Yeah,

3487
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:32,620
but it's human and it's,
it's the human of today,

3488
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:35,230
you know,
it's the human where we find ourselves

3489
02:37:35,290 --> 02:37:40,120
existing in communicating that clearly
is on some sort of path,

3490
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:45,600
some sort of weird path of progress and
of innovation and of understanding that

3491
02:37:48,671 --> 02:37:51,310
we're in the middle of.
We're in the middle of the storm of

3492
02:37:51,311 --> 02:37:56,170
understanding and it's happening like
clearly in your own life and you're

3493
02:37:56,171 --> 02:37:57,880
living in,
out in front of the whole world.

3494
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:00,553
Yeah.

3495
02:38:03,150 --> 02:38:03,983
And on that note,

3496
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:08,640
that's good way to wrap it up.
We did already two hours and 45 minutes,

3497
02:38:08,700 --> 02:38:09,710
believe it or not.
Yeah,

3498
02:38:09,750 --> 02:38:10,690
just flew by.
Yeah.

3499
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:17,030
You're a brave person and I think it's
really important what you're doing.

3500
02:38:17,420 --> 02:38:20,900
Massive really is super hard to do I'm
sure.

3501
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:24,450
And uh,
the fact that twitter is what started

3502
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:26,930
twitter so much,
I just,

3503
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:29,550
I can not,
like you were saying earlier about like,

3504
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:32,550
oh there's only 140 characters like Joe
just twitter,

3505
02:38:32,580 --> 02:38:35,460
but here's the thing,
like it's so crazy like twitter,

3506
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,680
like the fact that it's only 140
characters,

3507
02:38:37,681 --> 02:38:42,570
like nothing taught me how to be more.
Like I'm very verbose pr I talk a lot

3508
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:45,720
but like in writing and then I do the
same thing in writing but like on

3509
02:38:45,721 --> 02:38:48,420
twitter,
like it taught me to like distill my

3510
02:38:48,421 --> 02:38:52,470
ideas and become concise and it stopped
me from using.

3511
02:38:52,471 --> 02:38:55,200
That was one of the things,
one of the ways that I stopped like

3512
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:57,870
insulting people instinctively because
like we did,

3513
02:38:57,871 --> 02:39:00,930
we did it so much.
Like we would write these elaborate

3514
02:39:00,931 --> 02:39:03,720
insults like responding to emails and
stuff because like obviously an email

3515
02:39:03,721 --> 02:39:05,730
you can write as much as you want.
But like on twitter,

3516
02:39:05,930 --> 02:39:08,760
like so it's two things like one on the
end and 40 characters.

3517
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:10,350
It's like throwing a,
you idiot.

3518
02:39:10,380 --> 02:39:12,840
Like there's an just,
there's no space for it,

3519
02:39:13,890 --> 02:39:17,910
but also like when I did do that,
like there's this immediate feedback

3520
02:39:17,911 --> 02:39:22,380
loop that you get so like you can watch
the conversation derail in real time and

3521
02:39:22,381 --> 02:39:23,071
then realized like,
okay,

3522
02:39:23,071 --> 02:39:24,960
no,
I just need to not like because it just

3523
02:39:25,050 --> 02:39:28,050
instead of addressing the arguments,
like then you're saying like,

3524
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:28,850
you know,
you,

3525
02:39:28,850 --> 02:39:31,230
like you don't know me,
they rusty know they'll answer and like

3526
02:39:31,231 --> 02:39:31,930
it just,
it,

3527
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:34,890
it stops,
it stops the conversation like you want

3528
02:39:34,891 --> 02:39:38,280
it to be about the points are there was
like I learned so much about

3529
02:39:38,281 --> 02:39:41,160
communication from twitter and I just
love it so much.

3530
02:39:41,161 --> 02:39:43,530
Like it's just a tool,
like it depends on how we use it.

3531
02:39:43,630 --> 02:39:46,930
I use it a lot and I learned a lot of
things on it.

3532
02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:50,110
I mean I'm constantly being sent
articles and that's where I found out

3533
02:39:50,111 --> 02:39:54,910
about the 300,000 year old human and I
mean every day someone sends me

3534
02:39:54,911 --> 02:39:56,860
something and I retweet it.
Just it's,

3535
02:39:57,230 --> 02:39:58,470
we got connected.
Yeah,

3536
02:39:58,570 --> 02:39:59,860
there you go.
So there you go.

3537
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:01,250
More twitter.
Yes.

3538
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:04,060
Your book is coming out.
When I

3539
02:40:04,060 --> 02:40:06,100
don't know yet,
I haven't seen the last draft.

3540
02:40:06,210 --> 02:40:07,230
Uh,
and I,
