Come on.

4
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,883
Sorry man.

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,671
Yeah,

Can't wait.

28
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,830
Oh yeah.

29
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,191
I've got to learn.

30
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:35,760
Of course.

31
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,810
Edgy Bra.

32
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,040
Also known as Eddie Bravo.

33
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,460
That's what they taught
when we were in Brazil.

34
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:44,520
That's the calling the hey is Joe Moran.

35
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,420
Were those the first giant
tournament that there was an la Joe,

36
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,020
my analyst,

37
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,670
he was the main promoter
and in my division that was
45 guys were all blue belts

38
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,181
and my division,

39
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:54,630
he's,

40
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,310
and you got to sit
there and listen to him.

41
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,850
Call out everyone's name
and I'm sitting there,

42
00:00:58,851 --> 00:00:59,611
I'm waiting for him to call.

43
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:00,444
My name is,

44
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,040
he looks,

45
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,980
he looks at the clipboard,

46
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:02,640
then he looks up,

47
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,480
here's your bra.

48
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,860
I'm standing right in front of him.

49
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:07,081
I'm like,

50
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,321
man,

51
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,410
when are they going to call my dad?

52
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,700
Like fuck.

53
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,531
And then someone say,

54
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:12,721
dude,

55
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,890
I think he's saying your name.

56
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,753
No Way.

57
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,010
I could never guess your
nationality by the way.

58
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm looking at you right.

59
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,420
Ever.

60
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,710
So it was just in Mexico and I was
leaving and he had to go through Mexican

61
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:25,440
customs and the guy looked
at my passport just today.

62
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,490
He looked at my passport.

63
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,660
It says Edgar,

64
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,590
I'd bet at the Bravo,

65
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,723
he looks at it.

66
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,310
Duet is Latino.

67
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,110
I go and I had to speak Spanish.

68
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:34,950
My Spanish sucks,

69
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:38,400
but I can say I see I'm
going to spit on me,

70
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,243
papayas,

71
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,610
the Chihuahua and my mother.

72
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,513
They one of the hotter,

73
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,730
I can say that back.

74
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,760
It sounds like I speak
really good Spanish.

75
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,110
I got that mastered.

76
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,460
I've said that a million times.

77
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:48,540
I got that shit wired.

78
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,960
So I sat that and he was
convinced and my shit,

79
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,560
you look,

80
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,510
you look like you look tie.

81
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,433
Let's be honest.

82
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,330
[inaudible]

83
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,293
man.

84
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,383
He could definitely,

85
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,010
it can definitely be
like some like ex pat,

86
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,690
he had went over there with
PTSD 100% awesome growing up.

87
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:10,780
Unfortunate Tyler

88
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,290
Filipino.

89
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,910
Remember when the fee they
shipped the Filipinos in?

90
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:15,181
In the,

91
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,530
in the 80s sure.

92
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,883
Shit man.

93
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,851
But I was born in,

94
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,010
does anybody know these guys?

95
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,620
Um,

96
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,650
Sean Strickland who we're
looking at right now.

97
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,290
Yeah.

98
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,550
I was hitting himself a
few days acute in Santiago.

99
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,440
Got His name blocked off.

100
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:28,981
Good job.

101
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,020
UFC fucking website designers.

102
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,921
He's in a different point.

103
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,230
The guy's head in front
of his fucking name.

104
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,420
20th Yeah.

105
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,043
Santiago.

106
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,430
Well you've seen his points.

107
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,170
He need to be a Ponzi Niebuhr.

108
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,393
Is he from Brazil?

109
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,253
Everyone is going to be a,

110
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,160
like a lot of people from Brazil
because this card is live from Brazil.

111
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
So if you're,

112
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,240
if you're tuning in and you're trying
to figure out how the fuck do we sync it

113
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:55,050
up because the internet is always going
to be a few seconds slower than live

114
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,501
action.

115
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,950
So what we're seeing and what you're,

116
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:57,481
you're seeing,

117
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,350
it's going to be a little different.

118
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,430
So pause your TV.

119
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,140
That's the best way.

120
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Pause your TV and like maybe counted 10
and I'm going to tell you exactly when I

121
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,400
see five minutes on the first round.

122
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,770
It's about to start now.

123
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,480
It says four 58 right now.

124
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,690
45074506455 there you go.

125
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:16,931
All right.

126
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,160
We're sinked up ponds,

127
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,450
an Ebu and Strickland.

128
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,540
Remember there was only three or four
Brazilian fighters and now there's

129
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,190
hundreds of thousands.

130
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,230
Do you know how many fighters
are in the UFC roster now?

131
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,040
They guess,

132
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,401
uh,

133
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,290
1100 8,500 yeah,

134
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,070
he's right.

135
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,030
500 wow.

136
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,103
Isn't it insane?

137
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,800
What?

138
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,700
500 yeah.

139
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,780
And that really ponds and Nivo with
a right hand that expanded that Joe's

140
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,231
stricken one.

141
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,064
The Nice uppercut.

142
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,150
How do they have fun?

143
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,520
I thought they had like maybe a
hundred people on the roster period.

144
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:45,851
No,

145
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,031
no.

146
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,710
They've had a few hundred for a while.

147
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:52,711
They've had like two 5,300 but now you
know also I think that with Bella tour

148
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,974
out there,

149
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,150
they'd got to make sure they scoop up
the young talent as it's coming up.

150
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,110
Cause would have Bella tour gets a hold
of John Jones before the UFC does and

151
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:06,220
they got some guy over there and just
rag doll in people and John Jones in them

152
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:06,681
and you go,

153
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,440
Oh fuck we missed that guy.

154
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,400
You remember probably like two years
ago when they were making crazy cuts

155
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,340
because they had to get rid of a
hundred guys like sort amount of time.

156
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,470
Dudes are just getting [inaudible] guys.

157
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,430
Well John Fitch got cut.

158
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,070
Oh left big left hook by
ponds and Nivo Strickland.

159
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:25,000
Very experienced man.

160
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:25,271
Look at him.

161
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:25,990
Hang on.

162
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,823
Very smart.

163
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,300
Yeah.

164
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,500
You know how they showed the records?

165
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,510
15 to know and the other guy's 20 and two.

166
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,670
You really don't know
guys records these days.

167
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,373
Why do you say that?

168
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,140
Uh,

169
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,680
I cause I feel like inbox
and you look more at records.

170
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,514
I feel like

171
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,823
cares about

172
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,340
like you know the stars.

173
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,091
I was confused.

174
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:47,950
I thought you were saying
like they might not,

175
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,490
you might,

176
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:48,850
they might.

177
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,970
It might be a bullshit record.

178
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,131
No,

179
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:50,231
no,

180
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:50,311
no,

181
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:50,531
no.

182
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:51,720
You're saying most people don't know.

183
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,043
You just know.

184
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,620
I don't know anybody.

185
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,620
Like I couldn't tell you.

186
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,660
Oh yeah.

187
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,970
When you're a boxing fan you
have to know everybody's record.

188
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,833
Yeah.

189
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,913
24 knock,

190
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,540
right?

191
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,170
Had the fuck.

192
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,900
Nah,

193
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,380
he got to know everybody in the top 10.

194
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,310
It was just,

195
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,143
did you go to that?

196
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,720
Open up the buck and open up ring and
go right to the standings like top 10 of

197
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,530
every division.

198
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,680
I would just stare at that
shit and try to memorize it.

199
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,730
Did you guys see Gennady
Golovkin last month?

200
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:20,564
Triple G.

201
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,800
He's up to these guys.

202
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:22,690
It's three g's.

203
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,580
What's the third g great.

204
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,380
Gennady Golovkin is that it?

205
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:26,741
No,

206
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,500
I think that three g I think in uh,

207
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,540
he's from a Cogeco.

208
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,290
Stan [inaudible] Stan.

209
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:40,040
But what is it when it isn't that
kind of fended still get a bed.

210
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:44,050
[inaudible]

211
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,920
like you're headed idiot.

212
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,500
Who's like giving a speech
in front of his class.

213
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,570
I looked up at the sky when I said it.

214
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,811
Oh,

215
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,760
this is why you're wearing a scarf,

216
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,281
by the way,

217
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:53,140
because I'm French.

218
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,020
I'm keeping my preset.

219
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,470
Your wife dressed you before got here.

220
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,100
That's a lie.

221
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,670
That's a lie.

222
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,503
I don't want to say,

223
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,590
I just think it's cashmere.

224
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,300
It's a cashmere.

225
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,440
His cashmere neck right here.

226
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,300
It's made out of the awkward
pumps and evils in trouble,

227
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:05,610
man.

228
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,580
Strictly and I've not
stopped looking at his hair.

229
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,440
I'm really attracted to him.

230
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,410
I mean it's Megan,

231
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,241
this motherfucker work.

232
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:11,920
I'll tell you that.

233
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,320
It's to keep some mixing up
from punches to take downs.

234
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,970
He's putting a lot of
pressure on this guy.

235
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,083
I'm not tall.

236
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,800
Polish strict.

237
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,643
Right.

238
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,990
He could be anything American.

239
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah.

240
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,610
I think it'd be from Georgia.

241
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,260
He can be French.

242
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,770
I hate to tell you he
could be from France.

243
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,100
He could be from Czechoslovakia
if won't say he kicked me out.

244
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:28,940
My last name,

245
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,550
like [inaudible] chick,

246
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,980
like,

247
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,430
Hey,

248
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,630
he'll Honda jet jet check.

249
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,470
I think getting out of go
up against from Kurdistan.

250
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,190
Oh,

251
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,960
it'd be right.

252
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,220
Oh,

253
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,230
did you watch the fight though?

254
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,051
I didn't watch it.

255
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:39,270
I was,

256
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,360
I seen him last night floor.

257
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,730
Yeah.

258
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,563
I love that.

259
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,620
I love that guy.

260
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:42,921
Oh,

261
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,450
head kicked by ponds and Ebo.

262
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,010
Everyone wants to see him.

263
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:46,491
Verse Andre.

264
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,001
Warden that.

265
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:47,481
Oh yeah,

266
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:48,171
that's a great fight.

267
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,550
I don't think Andre
Ward's going to take it.

268
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,710
Why would he take it Coleville of you?

269
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,030
Me and her are no Andre Ward.

270
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:53,864
Hold on.

271
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,160
Look what's going on.

272
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:55,431
Evo.

273
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,091
Going off.

274
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:56,331
Girl.

275
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,530
Fucking Duran over here.

276
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:57,851
Crazy.

277
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,980
Five fingers in the neck to
look like he's going crazy.

278
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,390
Fuck.

279
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,021
Oh,

280
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,570
that was a hard right hand
isn't woke his ass up.

281
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,170
Yeah.

282
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,951
I don't know what it is,

283
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,410
but there's a minute to go and
he's still fucking going at it.

284
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,830
It's like rocky Graziano man.

285
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,840
I can't hear the crowd by,

286
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,770
but they're going nuts.

287
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,640
It was a good one.

288
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,240
Grounds.

289
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,810
Most Yanno little volume on
the TV commercial on Jamie.

290
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,693
Hey,

291
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,421
fuck.

292
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,520
What were we just talking about?

293
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,410
Yeah,

294
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,650
why don't we take that?

295
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,523
Because I don't,

296
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,390
because we know triple g,

297
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,100
but I don't think triple
g's that big of a star.

298
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,650
The triple t make all sold a lot.

299
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,400
Like he's not,

300
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,000
he's not.

301
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,121
No,

302
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:32,421
he's not.

303
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:32,511
No,

304
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,010
he's not.

305
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,410
It's shut the fuck up cause Kovalev was
the one who is going to find you're out

306
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:40,670
of your 160160170 five that's
three different weight classes.

307
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,451
They all right.

308
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:46,451
Andre Ward one 68 Golovkin one 60
called 1175 [inaudible] 75 were you guys

309
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:48,014
talking about boxing?

310
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,921
Oh really?

311
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:51,110
I thought he's applied to every way.

312
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,790
Oh really?

313
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,350
Yeah.

314
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,860
He wants to fight Miguel
Cotto that's what he wants.

315
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,620
Kovalev does.

316
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,250
No,

317
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,083
Andre Ward does.

318
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,400
Triple g wants to fight.

319
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,190
You guys are really into
boxing like yeah man.

320
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:01,611
You know what?

321
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,100
I should probably say that on the podcast
because a bunch of people asked me,

322
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,650
cause I,

323
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,080
a long time ago I'd gotten this debate
on ESPN with that fucking Lou Dibella

324
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,963
guy.

325
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,540
The only reason why I went on that guy
like that to raise one is UFC wanted me

326
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,960
to play too.

327
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,510
They sicked me all this guy cause they
knew this guy talks a lot of shit about

328
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:23,570
the UFC and he just started
doing all the dos Joe.

329
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,103
Yeah.

330
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,821
Joe Goes,

331
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,530
I guess on that interview juggles.

332
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,190
The fact is that boxing
is getting swallowed.

333
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,040
It's getting swallowed.

334
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,780
He's getting smelled
by more dynamic sport,

335
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,581
you know?

336
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,500
But I've always been a boxing fan,

337
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,910
just like I'm a kickboxing Fran,

338
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,620
just like I'm a straight Jujitsu fan.

339
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:46,490
I'm a fan of Walmart,

340
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,650
fan of dummies.

341
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,220
No lobbying.

342
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,760
Told me you know a lot about
what's going on in boxing.

343
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,100
Oh yeah.

344
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,710
All I know is Matt packing.

345
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:56,740
Alan Floyd Mayweather going to find me,

346
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,070
said I'm going to make $1 billion.

347
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,250
Well go off gets old enough.

348
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:02,940
Fascinating guy because he's one of the
best fighters in the world and very few

349
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,840
people know who he is.

350
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,240
That's the side of like hardcore MMA fans.

351
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,680
Everybody knows who Floyd Mayweather is.

352
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,660
Everybody knows who Manny pack Yo is.

353
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,190
Those are the two guys.

354
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,670
But Gennady Golovkin is a
fucking murderous puncher.

355
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,040
I mean body shots like guy.

356
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:17,740
Yeah,

357
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,510
he's from Russia.

358
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,760
Beautiful Cutie little handsome fella.

359
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,150
He looks like he looks like guys in
the mix with these Floyd Mayweather.

360
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,980
Russians,

361
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,281
man.

362
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,070
So fear of is also Russian

363
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,060
punchers call them.

364
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,870
Margins are still good right now.

365
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,321
Dude.

366
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,230
If Vladimir demands and beaten
been beaten in 10 years,

367
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,320
not even close these letters best.

368
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,290
There's no really good heavyweights.

369
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,450
We can destroy you don't
you don't hear about,

370
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,570
but he's like years ahead of him about
these fights because his fights are so

371
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,310
dominant and he's boring.

372
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,480
He boxes them.

373
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:52,590
He just jabs him to death.

374
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,453
I love it.

375
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,520
Is Gray whale watches
I watch in the biggest,

376
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,331
strongest,

377
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,730
fastest and can touch him.

378
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,280
That Russian dude native go to
show that Russia duty fought,

379
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,450
made him go to war that first round.

380
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,830
He got dealt with them
finding the best black dudes.

381
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,640
Yeah.

382
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,350
Yeah.

383
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,183
He fights.

384
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,970
He fights his next fight
and he is a black guy.

385
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,720
Let's just be honest about some shit.

386
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,790
Russians are different white people.

387
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,540
Okay.

388
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,780
They just different white Siberia,

389
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,870
I don't want to say a tougher,

390
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,103
tougher.

391
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,830
Their environment is tougher.

392
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,510
They live in a harsher climate.

393
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,920
Their history is tougher.

394
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,560
They have a war torn history did.

395
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:35,070
They were conquered by the Mongols
for 200 plus fucking years.

396
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:35,641
You know,

397
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:40,641
that's a hard Siberian climate and the
country's flat and Mongo is telling me

398
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,500
you have a flag concern.

399
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,610
The Asian Chinese looking guys were
ruling over the white guys in the north.

400
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,400
A lot of people in Russia,

401
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,720
in certain parts of Russia,

402
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:52,321
look Chinese.

403
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:54,690
That's right on the border.

404
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:55,020
Yes.

405
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,920
I think I understand that.

406
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:56,754
But to say

407
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,400
we can't talk at the same time,

408
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,200
that's why we're wearing headphones boys.

409
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,753
Huh?

410
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,601
Day ahead of us.

411
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:05,700
As far as technology to science,

412
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,400
Russia,

413
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,700
no,

414
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:06,970
no,

415
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,803
no.

416
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,430
We're American.

417
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,263
Not Anymore.

418
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,410
I think at nine it's from Kazakhstan
and in that area you do see a lot of,

419
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,960
cause I can townies who look very Asian,

420
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,370
way more Asian and Caucasian.

421
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,630
Where's Kovalev looks,

422
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,590
he's Caucasian,

423
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,210
he's Caucasian and he'd go off,

424
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,820
go off,

425
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,653
can looks like a mix,

426
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,230
but he's a cute looking guy.

427
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,900
Like he could be like the suite
next door neighbor on a s,

428
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,250
maybe even the gay neighbor.

429
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,330
I'm on a Sitcom,

430
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,270
right.

431
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,270
That's his buddy comes in and just liver
punches you and do fucking oblivion.

432
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,680
He's a sensational boxer and
he's a highly aggressive,

433
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:40,981
well,

434
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:41,151
he,

435
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,830
he's special because he has knockout
power in his left hand and right hand.

436
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:44,161
You know,

437
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,710
certain guys have certain
branches to knock people out.

438
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:46,900
Yeah.

439
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,240
He's not guys out with jabs.

440
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,074
Left hooks,

441
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,441
right.

442
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:49,830
Hooks,

443
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,663
uppercuts.

444
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:50,881
Yeah.

445
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,110
I saw a highlight clip.

446
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,770
He dropped the do with the
right hand to the body.

447
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,490
It's ridiculous.

448
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,800
Just he's hitting people so fucking hard.

449
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,570
But America doesn't care.

450
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,990
Micar won't jump on board unless you
can be good in front of a camera.

451
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,141
Well,

452
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:02,471
dude,

453
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:02,891
if the,

454
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,220
if you,

455
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,090
when I was a kid,

456
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,020
if someone came along and told me that
we were going to have a white heavyweight

457
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,680
champion that no one would give a fuck
about and no one could beat the guy,

458
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,341
I'd be like,

459
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,390
that doesn't even make sense.

460
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,270
Like what kind of bizarro
world we live in it and saying,

461
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,611
wait a minute,

462
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,610
he's fighting the best guys
dominant now when I can't,

463
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,210
when I was totally into boxing,

464
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,470
you never heard of such a thing.

465
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:23,980
Dude,

466
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,660
he's got a p Gerry Cooney.

467
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,650
Remember Gerry Cooney,

468
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,521
he's brilliant.

469
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,870
He's got a phd.

470
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,231
Like,

471
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,580
he's a brilliant guy.

472
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,900
He plays chess.

473
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,190
So let's Tex Cobb,

474
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,250
what did that get up?

475
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,670
Let me ask you this.

476
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,410
Jermaine Taylor,

477
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:38,951
is that his name?

478
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:39,670
Tremaine Taylor.

479
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,821
Yeah.

480
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,050
He's all fucked up now too.

481
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,380
That's old school that's doing all kinds
of crazy violence shit like outbursts.

482
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,450
Pull a gun on punchbowl.

483
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,050
Got arrested.

484
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,660
Risk Cup.

485
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,081
I'm sorry,

486
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,010
not your main Taylor.

487
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,470
Who was the guy the big,

488
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,270
the guy would just beat wilder.

489
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,403
Yes.

490
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,973
Yeah.

491
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,141
How would he do against,

492
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:57,250
he's gonna is he gonna fight it?

493
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,084
He's not ready.

494
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,451
He'll,

495
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,171
he'll be ready.

496
00:12:59,171 --> 00:12:59,291
Have,

497
00:12:59,291 --> 00:12:59,561
I mean,

498
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:00,430
he might be ready.

499
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,450
He might be able to catch them.

500
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:05,350
The thing about Klitschkos Klitschko has
been knocked out back in the day when

501
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,100
he first started working with Emanuel
steward or right before he first started

502
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:09,780
working with the manual.

503
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,670
You went to a man who
hasn't been touched and he,

504
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:12,881
uh,

505
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:13,820
when he went to a manual,

506
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,000
a manual just completely schooled him,

507
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,320
cleaned his game up,

508
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,790
and Emanuel Steward said he's the hardest
righthand puncher he's ever seen in

509
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,311
his life.

510
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:21,800
Wow.

511
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,140
Now's the guy had Lennox Lewis and just
stable took different white people.

512
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,220
You know what a manual it says,

513
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,030
he said it like Joe Jelly.

514
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,270
I beep number Gabet off.

515
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:32,440
That's a different kind of white person.

516
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,551
That's a different way.

517
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,290
Person that Charles and cock sucker.

518
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,580
This I'm not the same white pippy you
fucking grew up with in Calabasas,

519
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,310
but you're fucking [inaudible] away.

520
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,840
Get Out of your range rover.

521
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,610
Just suck his dick.

522
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:49,670
He's going to kill everybody.

523
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,023
Fight.

524
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,260
Yeah,

525
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,460
that's a good fine Strickland
cause a good grappler.

526
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,301
Ah,

527
00:13:58,301 --> 00:13:59,140
I'm gonna get a Mohawk.

528
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:01,150
I think it's like a Hari Krishna thing.

529
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,760
The ones we've lost the hair pony.

530
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,970
He lost the ponytail and
came up in the fight.

531
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,650
That's how bad dudes want pussy.

532
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,660
They're profilers and they
still grow their hair.

533
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,860
That covers over their eyes.

534
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,593
I know.

535
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,460
I appreciate it.

536
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,511
Hey,

537
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:17,920
if I had beautiful hair and my growth,

538
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:19,330
I always told when I fuck it.

539
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,440
Hixon when he was young,

540
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:25,060
I had this Crazy Samurai ponytail and it
was like part of his mystique when he's

541
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:28,900
this Samurai warrior going into new is
tattered black belt that almost look

542
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:33,650
white because it was so worn
and just show strangling.

543
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,010
True lines of dudes.

544
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:39,880
Just get them in a lie and line them
up one at a time and roll them up.

545
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:40,350
Shit.

546
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,690
Yup.

547
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,190
Roll them up like it's nothing.

548
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,023
Never get,

549
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,200
never get out of breath.

550
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,050
Tap One guy after the next.

551
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,220
It's still a handsome devil.

552
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,120
He's seen him label man.

553
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,040
We had him on Saturday and acted.

554
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,780
Just look sexy with bangs
and some people don't.

555
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,793
Yeah,

556
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,843
I never had.

557
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,260
You never have to.

558
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,490
I keep my eyes.

559
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,290
Keep him out of my eyes.

560
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,310
You're a rugged guy though.

561
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:03,060
You gotta be ready for
action in a moment's notice.

562
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,561
Thanks buddy.

563
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:06,590
I appreciate the fucking pig hunt
we're going on with Steven Rinella.

564
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,060
Got To get my license.

565
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,240
We'll do that.

566
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,220
Let's do that this week.

567
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,650
You in town this week you're
going to go kill a pig.

568
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,910
Fuck down and when to
to hone ranch up north.

569
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,500
Wild been going there with Cameron Hanes.

570
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,370
We're going to Sacramento.

571
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,030
Ooh,

572
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,720
that's where we're going.

573
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,553
It's up in that area.

574
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,770
I don't think so.

575
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,910
I think we're using rifles.

576
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,380
They have an infestation.

577
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,400
Oh yeah.

578
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,990
Northern California has literally has
a pig infestation and a lot of it.

579
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,550
Yup.

580
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,010
Well,

581
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,940
in neighborhoods,

582
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,050
San Jose News,

583
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,010
the other day they had this,

584
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:43,251
uh,

585
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:47,600
this news clipping of these wild pigs
were tearing up these people's lawns in

586
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:48,434
the suburbs.

587
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,560
I'd make him just ripping the,

588
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm ripping the lawn apart,

589
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,530
looking for something to eat.

590
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,970
And they're pretty gnarly.

591
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:56,241
Right.

592
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:56,810
Like the,

593
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,550
for a kid that's incredible.

594
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,470
For California and Fresno,

595
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,600
there's a big problem and
it's that weird San hose

596
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,940
and like a real issue.

597
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,200
Oh yeah.

598
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,780
It's real issue.

599
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,030
But you know,

600
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,440
that's great.

601
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,273
I'm hunters.

602
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,150
We have,

603
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,690
uh,

604
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,620
a huge,

605
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:13,190
uh,

606
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,270
I don't know if it's a problem,

607
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:18,710
but we got raccoons everywhere
at families of raccoons,

608
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,330
little babies traveling together,

609
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,670
coming to try to open
our door screen door.

610
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,390
I go,

611
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:24,710
Babe.

612
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,543
Oh Shit.

613
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,810
It's trickling on top.

614
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,644
Swarming on them.

615
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,810
Yeah.

616
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,610
I mean the pig problem is mitigated
slightly by the fact that they're not

617
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:35,930
allowed to hunt from mountain lions.

618
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,030
Some mountain lions eat some of the pigs.

619
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,030
I was going to say what's
their natural predator?

620
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,600
That's it.

621
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,650
Just no,

622
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,730
there's no natural predator.

623
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:44,361
They're not from here.

624
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:47,300
They're Eurasian wild boars there.

625
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:48,590
The a long time ago,

626
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,320
they believe that a lot of them
came from William Randolph Hearst

627
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,780
when we ran off.

628
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,600
Hearst had that Hearst castle
up in northern California.

629
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,150
That crazy fuck kept a bunch
of wild boars out there,

630
00:16:59,151 --> 00:16:59,600
man.

631
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,840
And a lot of them got loose tanks hers
and then they just run up fucking and

632
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,521
breeding.

633
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,250
And then of course on top of
that there's just wild pigs,

634
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,870
domestic pigs that you know became
Pharell and they start breeding out in the

635
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:14,240
wild and then they become a
totally different kind of pig.

636
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,850
But there's so many of
the northern California,

637
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,530
you could shoot as many as you want.

638
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,611
You could go like,

639
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:23,450
you could get all your meat from pigs
and just go up there like once every

640
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:23,991
couple months,

641
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,400
shoot four or five pigs,

642
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,540
bring them back with you.

643
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,370
And it doesn't cost very
much to get a pink tag,

644
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,900
so it should be easy to kill him up.

645
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,610
Yeah.

646
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,150
Got to take out some of these pigs.

647
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,063
I killed him.

648
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,580
I killed one of the first day we went.

649
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,180
Really?

650
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,920
Yeah.

651
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,753
I kill the pig.

652
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,480
It was like it got dark at five o'clock
I killed the pig at four 15 I just liked

653
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:41,570
that.

654
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,100
It's not going to be freezing this.

655
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,020
Why don't we just go up there?

656
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,740
Some machine guns do a gangster style.

657
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,220
You could do it that way on the copter.

658
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,860
I don't think there's any restriction.

659
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,790
They use it from a helicopter in Texas.

660
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,691
In Texas.

661
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:53,480
They have these shows
about them where they are.

662
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,361
It's crazy.

663
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:56,370
You think that's all Henry
Rollins do it right now?

664
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,060
Ted Nugent.

665
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,630
The opposite.

666
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,051
That's right.

667
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,470
My bad.

668
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,303
My bad.

669
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,780
Just some loud white guy.

670
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,360
Yeah,

671
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,193
right,

672
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,241
but yeah,

673
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,260
they do it out of helicopters.

674
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,190
They call it a pork lips.

675
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:09,630
Now is the most fucked up thing to watch
up there were colliding it just gunning

676
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,630
down these packs of pigs in Fresno.

677
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,610
This is Texas in Texas.

678
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:16,160
They allow them to hunt with Halifax.

679
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,970
They cost millions.

680
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,680
Reminds me neither.

681
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,090
I'm scared there's,

682
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,810
there is millions of
feral pigs in California.

683
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,680
Dom million.

684
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,200
I haven't seen,

685
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,881
you know what else,

686
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:31,050
what else did William Randolph Hearst
cause like he caused the peg problem but

687
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,060
the wheat problem.

688
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,190
Yeah.

689
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,580
He was also responsible
for weed being illegal.

690
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,180
He's a whoa head kick.

691
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,210
He was responsible for distributing the
propaganda and even possibly risk one of

692
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:45,540
the people responsible for
using the name marijuana.

693
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,720
So it was like a real asshole or you
have chosen that because of dupont and

694
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,960
there as well as well as his,

695
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:52,200
uh,

696
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,820
paper factories apparently.

697
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:54,751
But,

698
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:54,901
uh,

699
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,170
I mean that's the reason why William
Randolph Hearst was the subject of a,

700
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,580
that Orson Welles movie.

701
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,880
I mean that was the whole
Rosebud citizen Kane.

702
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,320
It's about William Randolph Hearst.

703
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,240
William Randolph Hearst was a gangster
when you had control of the newspaper

704
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,360
back when there was only
one newspaper kill me.

705
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,310
God Damn.

706
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,110
It's like is we're running stories.

707
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,460
They were running stories.

708
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:20,340
I like that one store
where woman smokes weed,

709
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:24,510
throws her kids out the building and
then a commit suicide for madness,

710
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,553
all that shit.

711
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,570
But I mean they really
wrote that in paper.

712
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:28,710
They made shit up.

713
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,680
Some people were terrified
of weed and they should be,

714
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:33,860
they should be wanting to scare everybody.

715
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,170
Took them 10 years of scaring
people into making it illegal.

716
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,921
Not only that,

717
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:40,190
this is after the
fucking great depression,

718
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,420
so people were cautious as it is,

719
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,231
you know?

720
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,000
I mean that was a crazy time.

721
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,230
Easy to brainwash people.

722
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:47,790
Back then everyone was getting the radio.

723
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,990
There's one radio station,

724
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,750
they go to the movies to watch a Newsreel,

725
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,220
total propaganda,

726
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,203
newsreels.

727
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,680
You never got the truth.

728
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,960
I feel like it's never any truth in that.

729
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,180
I feel like he's just starting
to get a good rap right.

730
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,340
Just now starting to
come down to the dock.

731
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,770
That's how long cause as a kid,

732
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:05,371
I remember as a kid,

733
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,270
even in high school,

734
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,530
I mean if you're smoking weed,

735
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:08,590
you're an idiot.

736
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,923
That's how I felt.

737
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,580
I felt that way until I met Eddie.

738
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,860
I felt that way until I
was 28 I felt that way.

739
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,690
About six months ago I started
hanging out with you guys.

740
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,490
I gotta be honest.

741
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,850
Pretty cool.

742
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,530
Well anybody that tells you
that people on weed or lazy,

743
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,281
it's like you.

744
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,030
I don't,

745
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,980
you got to pay attention
to all the shit I'm doing.

746
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,090
There's no way I'm lazy.

747
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,480
I just,

748
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:27,871
I'm not.

749
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,340
I'm a lot of things lazy.

750
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,174
He's not one of them.

751
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:30,690
Duke,

752
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,190
it might've gotten more intense with weed.

753
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,220
People who are lazy are
lazy and people when you're,

754
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,370
the one thing about the,

755
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:40,440
the marijuana is the paranoia that it
gives you about if you're doing the wrong

756
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:41,100
shit.

757
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,150
These guys wanting to war,

758
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:43,020
I fight really good.

759
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:44,940
Fight a fight.

760
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,350
I think that paranoia
makes you work harder.

761
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,930
You try to keep that paranoia at bay.

762
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:50,800
It's like a wolf.

763
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,180
You want to do everything you can to
fight off whatever the fuck that thing's

764
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,180
warning you against.

765
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,590
Cover your bases.

766
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,980
That's why it's so easy to get high and
go on stage cause he's done comedy a

767
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:01,210
million fucking times.

768
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:01,850
It's easy.

769
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,380
Yeah.

770
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,850
It's not something you're scared of doing.

771
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,500
Something you own is high.

772
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,870
When you're on stage 99.9% of the time,

773
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,763
that'd be a yes.

774
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,491
No,

775
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:11,740
I do like I did a couple
sober sets this week.

776
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,700
This is fine.

777
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,511
I like doing set,

778
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:15,550
so I did the ice house
of the night's over.

779
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:16,330
It's fine,

780
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,420
but you prefer to be like being
high when I'm coming up with shit,

781
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,680
that's when I especially like being high
because I don't know what I'm going to

782
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,310
say.

783
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,550
It's just comes creative.

784
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,090
You get into that flow state
where you're not there anymore,

785
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,700
you're not there anymore and things just
come out of nowhere and sometimes they

786
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:33,280
come out of nowhere and right
after it comes out of your mouth,

787
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:36,930
you're fucking laughing hysterically
like that and you can't even,

788
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,421
it gets,

789
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,950
it's not really your own shit.

790
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,650
It's the weeds joke
we'd gave you that joke.

791
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,090
We don't look too we.

792
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:43,481
Yeah.

793
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,480
And you're like laughing cause we
gave you the shift stealing leads.

794
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:47,230
Shit,

795
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,370
we'd gave you this awesome.

796
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:49,870
Jeremy came out of your mouth.

797
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,160
But that's like the,

798
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:51,994
you're the channel.

799
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,181
Well,

800
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:52,391
let's,

801
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:52,960
where you,

802
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,960
humility really comes in when it comes
to certain aspects of psychedelics.

803
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,821
It's like you,

804
00:21:58,821 --> 00:21:59,500
you get,

805
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,750
you get the realization
while you're doing it.

806
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:04,330
Like if you're saying something
that's profound or whatever,

807
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:04,991
I like to pitch.

808
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,430
This isn't even really your thoughts,

809
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,271
you know,

810
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:07,810
this is like,

811
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,140
this is coming to you through
the plant to the plant.

812
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:11,711
And Eddie,

813
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:11,970
you,

814
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,120
you do Jujitsu high a lot.

815
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,000
Always,

816
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,570
always.

817
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:16,781
I mean,

818
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,850
he'll take a workout and not be high,

819
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:19,750
but why bother?

820
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,960
Yeah.

821
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,350
So like,

822
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,890
it's the only reason why you would bother.

823
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:27,340
It's like there's a
benefit to not being high.

824
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,450
You get high for a tournament.

825
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,150
No,

826
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,460
no,

827
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,850
no,

828
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,490
no.

829
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,050
I won.

830
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,883
It's not,

831
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,160
uh,

832
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,620
we doesn't make you feel good or bad.

833
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,720
It just makes you feel way
more of what you're feeling.

834
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,040
So they're going to be nervous.

835
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,960
If you're gonna do something
that's gonna make you nervous,

836
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,150
I wouldn't suggest you smoking it.

837
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,540
Wait,

838
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,990
really?

839
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,823
Oh yeah.

840
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,520
It could,

841
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,430
it could,

842
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,580
it can get paranoid.

843
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,480
So,

844
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,990
uh,

845
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,980
but when you,

846
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:54,520
if you're going to do something that
is not going to give you that you love,

847
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:56,800
like he's just going to go do Jujitsu
and you're just going to have fun.

848
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,700
Yeah.

849
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,451
Then you smoke.

850
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:01,170
We didn't have more fun because
that's what you're feeling and like,

851
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,421
yeah,

852
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,021
this is awesome.

853
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:02,620
You're not,

854
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:02,981
you're not,

855
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,360
you're not nervous or anything.

856
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,450
So I'm,

857
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,240
I'm worried if I got into weed I would
just become like 320 pounds cookie

858
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:10,750
monster.

859
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,351
You wouldn't do that.

860
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,184
Why would you do that?

861
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,650
Cause I love to eat,

862
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,460
so to say.

863
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:15,771
Dude,

864
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:16,780
do you know how much I eat?

865
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,180
I eat so much when we go to restaurants,

866
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:20,260
people think I'm joking.

867
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,930
Like when I go to restaurants after shows,

868
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,510
I ordered two meals and they'll go,

869
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,310
do you still want the steak?

870
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,571
I go,

871
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:28,404
I want that too.

872
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,470
And they're like this too much food.

873
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:30,550
And like it's not too much food.

874
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,120
Just bring it,

875
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,380
you're pretty lean too though.

876
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:32,891
That's good.

877
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:33,724
Genetics,

878
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,361
good genetics.

879
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:35,260
But I also work out,

880
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,281
I work out,

881
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:36,730
man.

882
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,170
You gotta you gotta you gotta do it.

883
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:38,890
You've got to work out.

884
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,011
Well,

885
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:39,470
no I wouldn't.

886
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,540
I know I'm not you.

887
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,374
Of course you do.

888
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,450
But I'm saying for people
that complain about it,

889
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:43,780
man,

890
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,740
it's just that simple.

891
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,040
If you like to eat,

892
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,491
bitch,

893
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,540
you better burn that shit off.

894
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,020
True.

895
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,520
But I definitely have good genetics too.

896
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,160
There's some people that they could
look at a cake and they get fat.

897
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,640
Yeah.

898
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,930
But you do get the munchies though.

899
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,390
You do get the munchies
and it does for me,

900
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:59,090
cause I got a sweet dude.

901
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,780
You work out so hard and if you've got
high and got paranoid about getting fat,

902
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,960
you probably can try to
work out even harder.

903
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,981
He's probably like,

904
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:09,530
but it's an extra
sessions just to lean up.

905
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,963
You know,

906
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,201
you're,

907
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,620
you're on some crazy diet right now,

908
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:12,861
right?

909
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,700
You're looking slender.

910
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:14,600
You sexy pitch.

911
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,710
Look at his face.

912
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,300
It's all taught every bit to look at them.

913
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,940
You look,

914
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,020
you might be hitting me.

915
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:22,100
You're obviously giant,

916
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:23,750
but you look like Lena,

917
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,330
you're losing body fat if
you're doing something.

918
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:26,751
Yeah.

919
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:30,530
Just been doing this diet and my trainer
had me on a no carb diet for two weeks.

920
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,453
No carbs,

921
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,713
no carbs at all.

922
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,490
Hmm.

923
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,730
Eddie did that shit for years.

924
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,080
Really low carb.

925
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,770
Low carb.

926
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:36,921
Well,

927
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:37,611
you'd take the cans.

928
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,930
I was doing that Atkins thing.

929
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,060
And you stopped doing it?

930
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,500
Yeah.

931
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,333
How come?

932
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,220
How much protein or no,

933
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:46,610
you know,

934
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,241
I don't know man.

935
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:48,050
It was,

936
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,360
I hung in there and hung in there,

937
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:50,720
man,

938
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,130
you got to have a cheat day on Sunday.

939
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,430
You have to have under 30 carbs a day.

940
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,040
If you could do that under 30 carbs a day,

941
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,470
then on one out of the seven days,

942
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,220
Sunday you can eat whatever the fuck
you want for just one meal or the whole

943
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:04,321
day.

944
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:06,170
The whole day you have a cheat day,

945
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,100
you just slept.

946
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,070
So I was living my life just for Sunday.

947
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,560
I was just trying to
get the fucking Sunday.

948
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,260
I didn't care about Friday we went out.

949
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,580
I just want her to get the fuck.

950
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,820
I was just thinking about
bread and how it's going.

951
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,160
And then Sunday I couldn't
wait for the sun to come up.

952
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:23,120
When the sun came up.

953
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,360
I would just tear shit up and then
I would get too full and I go,

954
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:27,161
here's my deck at the end.

955
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:28,010
Anything now I can't,

956
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,263
and I smelled smoke.

957
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,051
I smoke a lot of,

958
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:31,270
we try and get the munchies going,

959
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:32,620
well fuck the sun's going down.

960
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,483
I'm not even hungry.

961
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,363
Fuck,

962
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:34,940
I'm trying.

963
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,350
Then I,

964
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,070
I I because live in like a crazy man.

965
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,393
Yeah.

966
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,540
I was like,

967
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,020
now I'm starting to tell you
how crazy was he used to.

968
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,740
We used to go to restaurants and eat
and he would take the bread and he would

969
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:47,420
break the bread apart and smell it.

970
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,570
He wouldn't eat the bread and
everybody would want bread.

971
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:50,781
They were like,

972
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:52,220
what the fuck is going on with the bread?

973
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,940
Eddie had taken like every
piece of bread and broken apart.

974
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,970
So it's often,

975
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,810
did you get good results from it or just,

976
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,950
I was really lean and uh,

977
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,660
I'd never been that muscular or anything,

978
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:08,450
but I was losing and I was single.

979
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:08,991
It was right.

980
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:09,560
And you know,

981
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,360
I was a single as hell and
the leaner I got the uh,

982
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,380
uh,

983
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,930
easier meeting members of the opposite,

984
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,010
the opposite sex where,

985
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,903
you know what I'm saying?

986
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,210
Yeah,

987
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,890
definitely right away everything changed.

988
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,243
Exactly.

989
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,140
I was starving my brain.

990
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,320
But then that Sunday,

991
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,450
that Sunday eventually turned into,

992
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,160
I'm going to start Saturday night
now let's see what have I tested?

993
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:34,551
It would,

994
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,560
my body is still change cause you know,

995
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,820
if you've got 30 grams a day,

996
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:39,380
Monday through Saturday,

997
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,080
somehow your body is fixed in a way
that you could trash on Sunday and

998
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,181
it,

999
00:26:44,181 --> 00:26:45,810
and it doesn't make any
difference with your weight.

1000
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,300
It'll reject everything
and now you live on,

1001
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:50,160
so now I'm on Saturday night,

1002
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,810
late Saturday night I'd say,

1003
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,201
fuck it,

1004
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:52,950
I'm going to stop.

1005
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,120
And I'd go six months and I go,

1006
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:54,954
that was my thing.

1007
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,440
It hasn't,

1008
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,610
my weight hasn't changed.

1009
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,640
Fuck you could actually take
it into that night before.

1010
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,430
So Saturday nights I couldn't
wait Saturday during the day,

1011
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:02,671
I'm like,

1012
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,504
fucking when,

1013
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,470
when do I start this?

1014
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,910
Like when the sun goes down,

1015
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,200
I would just get too crazy.

1016
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:11,370
And then it turned into Saturday morning
I would start and then it was okay,

1017
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,710
Saturday and Sunday I'm
going to have a cheat day,

1018
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,583
a pancake,

1019
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,160
and then it turned into Friday
night and then I just forget.

1020
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,240
And then it was just
crazy and I just stopped.

1021
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,160
My focus was known book in the win column.

1022
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,000
I wonder how much longer frank Mir
can keep going if he loses this fight.

1023
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,440
We're going to have to bring
them on fucker in here for,

1024
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,720
I think you'd be a surprise dog.

1025
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,060
No,

1026
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,020
I'm gonna bring him in here.

1027
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,010
Right?

1028
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,843
John's got something.

1029
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,200
You could bring them in and said,

1030
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:43,471
Joe,

1031
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:44,304
you do the same.

1032
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,330
And I have to be there saying nothing.

1033
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,970
You're going to be the guy that they
talked to afterwards and console and you

1034
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:54,804
know they're gonna.

1035
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,680
I'll just be patching bro.

1036
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,430
You hanging in there Joe?

1037
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,410
Crucifies doing,

1038
00:27:59,411 --> 00:27:59,670
Bro.

1039
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,750
I've been there man.

1040
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,210
Don't worry.

1041
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,480
[inaudible]

1042
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,363
support group.

1043
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,480
And then once a week you have the
support group podcast turned out,

1044
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,410
turned twice it twice.

1045
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,030
If we could bring Tex Cobb in this room
right now and have a conversation with

1046
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:15,570

1047
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:15,990

1050
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:20,900
Yeah,

1051
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,601
it's like scared straight.

1052
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,120
You're going to start bringing in like a,

1053
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,570
don't forget you're still alive.

1054
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,980
He died right now,

1055
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,421

1056
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:28,350

1058
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,270
Listen to Tex Cobb these days.

1059
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:30,870
Really?

1060
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,501
Oh,

1061
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,190
good Lord.

1062
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,180
That's aw man.

1063
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,400
He had an acting career for a while.

1064
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,490
Bill.

1065
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,450
Really uncommon.

1066
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:37,770
Valerie was down common values.

1067
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,191
Good man.

1068
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:38,530
I was really,

1069
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,630
he was a kickboxer before.

1070
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:40,470
He was a boxer too.

1071
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:40,681
You know,

1072
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:43,330
he was a accomplished
kickboxer and it's over.

1073
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,490
I don't know who this guy is.

1074
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,643
Larry Holmes.

1075
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,873
Tex Cobb.

1076
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,470
He got beat up by Larry Holmes.

1077
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:50,280
So bad.

1078
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,350
Howard Cosell quit calling boxing.

1079
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,630
Wow.

1080
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,463
Yup,

1081
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,943
I'm done.

1082
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,521
He said,

1083
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:56,790
you know what?

1084
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,050
Fuck it.

1085
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,661
I'm done.

1086
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,010
And I disgusted.

1087
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,491
Yeah,

1088
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:01,260
he wa he wouldn't remember watching.

1089
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,710
My mother was with me
and my mother was saying,

1090
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:05,430
my mother said,

1091
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,860
she literally said I should get,

1092
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:10,920
my father was saying this is a
slaughter and they stopped the fight.

1093
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:11,970
My mother said he may have,

1094
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,730
he may have an extra plate and is
far ahead so he's probably fine.

1095
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,740
I remember mother said that an extra

1096
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,830
physiology physiology,

1097
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,920
he may have another plate and as far ahead
to he's five and my husband was a guy

1098
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:31,440
I knew he didn't did a coat in the winter,

1099
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,030
he never wore coat and she goes,

1100
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,920
oh he probably hasn't
had an enlarged heart.

1101
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,480
So it pumps lots of blood to his,

1102
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,560
you have a sore throat,

1103
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:40,770
a scarf on like sort of in
homage to the east coast.

1104
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,350
Yes.

1105
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,890
Yes I do.

1106
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,723
Yes.

1107
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,613
I

1108
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,390
find that I've been watching Downton Abbey

1109
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:48,821
probably.

1110
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:49,930
Gosh shouting yesterday.

1111
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,850
We're shouting full.

1112
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,810
I'm passionate.

1113
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,930
No,

1114
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,340
I'm just super passionate
about the town fire.

1115
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,240
He don't give a fuck.

1116
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,291
He don't give a fuck.

1117
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,380
He came in here and he'd say,

1118
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:03,671
you know what,

1119
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:08,671
I'm going to go in there and I'm not
going to give a fuck and took it off cause

1120
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,470
I'm hard cause you got a
non parenthood of being hot.

1121
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,750
And I'm like my neck suddenly
felt the fiery Alcantara.

1122
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,790
He's a bad motherfucker.

1123
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,390
I don't know a Frankie signs
because you don't know fighting bro.

1124
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,770
Frankie,

1125
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,603
same.

1126
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
How'd he say his name?

1127
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,760
Sans?

1128
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,401
What's his background?

1129
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:28,180
Turn this up Joe.

1130
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,670
We have a timeshare in Tom.

1131
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,311
Frankie's like,

1132
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:36,461
yeah,

1133
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:39,520
I love some toilet paper is
a six pack in the fridge.

1134
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,800
Only speaks to Uri.

1135
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,780
All Co content kind of power.

1136
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,550
How do we,

1137
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,360
however you want to say it.

1138
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,800
He's a bad motherfucker dude.

1139
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,060
He's really good.

1140
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,760
That's that guy that you know.

1141
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:58,320
That was one of the most
impressive victories for
Uriah Faber when he beat this

1142
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:03,321
dude because Uriah came at him guns
blazing like within the first couple of

1143
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,230
seconds and then like literally
15 seconds into the fight,

1144
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:10,440
he's mounted the guys on top of your
Ryan and he's holding them there for the

1145
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:11,190
whole round.

1146
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,551
I mean,

1147
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:12,151
he's hitting them.

1148
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:13,380
There's a lot of ground
and pound going on,

1149
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:16,950
but you're right towards the end of the
round gets out of the position and then

1150
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:21,330
it just coming after him for
the end of that second round,

1151
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,560
third round puts the pace,

1152
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,310
just puts the base on them and
you could see the dude going,

1153
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:27,210
Jesus Christ,

1154
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,950
when is this motherfucker get tired?

1155
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,810
Chill man is one of the most impressive
performances of your rise career.

1156
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:35,680
Like a lot of people don't even talk
about that fight and it's because they

1157
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:37,170
started off so bad.

1158
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,150
I think Alcantara had his back.

1159
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:40,210
I know he mounted him and,

1160
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:40,451
but he,

1161
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:40,980
he,

1162
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,040
he got him in a very compromising
position very early in the fight when

1163
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,680
everybody's dry and
everybody's at full strength.

1164
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,680
Trump got out of it and gave it your all
men and I'll beat the brakes off of it.

1165
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,520
One of the coolest things ever,

1166
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:55,920
I heard a fight or say came
from your eye favors mouth.

1167
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,550
He,

1168
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,271
someone's beat him.

1169
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:58,320
It was a close decision.

1170
00:31:58,321 --> 00:31:59,760
One of those epic battles.

1171
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:00,060
I don't know,

1172
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,893
I forget who it was.

1173
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,750
He's only lost title fights by decision.

1174
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,350
Right.

1175
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,100
And he,

1176
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,840
he said after one of those fights,

1177
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,820
because I don't feel that bad.

1178
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,150
I mean,

1179
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,010
I was a close fight.

1180
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:10,920
Could have gone either way.

1181
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,970
I'm right there in the mix.

1182
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,640
I'm in the top.

1183
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,710
I'm mixing it up.

1184
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,431
Even though I lost,

1185
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:15,390
I'm like right there.

1186
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:15,931
He said,

1187
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:17,520
I think I'm a smidgen off.

1188
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,201
Yeah.

1189
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:18,781
So that's like,

1190
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,340
he has such a great attitude.

1191
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:24,320
He's always one one loss away or one
went away from title shot always.

1192
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,460
Well he's going to go to 45 now,

1193
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:27,510
which is very interesting.

1194
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:27,931
Frankie.

1195
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:28,111
Right.

1196
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:29,160
That's a crazy fight,

1197
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:29,431
man.

1198
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:32,790
Him and Frankie hunger 45 because
he wants to fight Frankie.

1199
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,810
He doesn't want to fight Tj.

1200
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,160
Hmm.

1201
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,993
Interesting.

1202
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:36,601
Yeah.

1203
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:37,740
I think he feels that,

1204
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,280
you know,

1205
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,980
it's not necessarily fight his teammate

1206
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,843
and uh,

1207
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,660
I think he probably would like to take
a break off that fucking horrible weight

1208
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,880
cut to get done in one 40 get smart.

1209
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,290
It's not a bad idea at all.

1210
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,110
In a super fight with Frankie is
fuck way better for him than Tj.

1211
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:52,281
Yeah.

1212
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:53,210
And if he does lose,

1213
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:53,361
hey,

1214
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,040
it's not even as division apparently.

1215
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:55,490
I know,

1216
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,680
apparently he's a,

1217
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,610
an amazing businessman.

1218
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,650
Owns a lot of properties.

1219
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,240
Yeah.

1220
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,420
It's [inaudible] it,

1221
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,540
yeah.

1222
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,100
He's a beast when it comes to business.

1223
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,270
And we talked about that before,

1224
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,270
but yeah,

1225
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,153
I apologize.

1226
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,480
Yeah,

1227
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:14,631
no,

1228
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:15,620
he's an ambitious dude,

1229
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:15,860
man.

1230
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,190
Yeah,

1231
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,671
it's interesting.

1232
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:17,504
He's the most,

1233
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,720
for sure the most famous and the most
popular guy that has not won a UFC title

1234
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,330
has been in the mix for as
long as he's been in the mix.

1235
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,190
When he was a WEC champion,

1236
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,530
was it like 2006 there's a while ago.

1237
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:30,731
Yeah.

1238
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:33,500
I remember he broke both his
hands against Mike Brown.

1239
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,903
Yeah.

1240
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,441
Throwing elbows.

1241
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:36,591
And I,

1242
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:37,700
and I actually talked to him,

1243
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:38,230
I said,

1244
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,961
do you practice that?

1245
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:39,141
He goes,

1246
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:39,974
no man,

1247
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,910
no I didn't.

1248
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,100
I've just like started throwing
my elbows cause I was like,

1249
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,480
there's nothing else I
could do at that point.

1250
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,120
I was like crazy when an is after,

1251
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:47,750
you know,

1252
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,580
the first fight where
Mike Brown caught him.

1253
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,540
He got too aggressive.

1254
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,220
My Brown Mike Brown
caught him on the chin.

1255
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,750
He used to be known for his insane ground
and pound where he would do something

1256
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,670
that no one has ever done.

1257
00:33:58,671 --> 00:33:59,570
I've never seen anybody,

1258
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,980
but I guess it's cause he's light.

1259
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,720
He would get in someone's guard.

1260
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,260
You takes,

1261
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,790
take them all down in the
beginning of his career,

1262
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,230
getting the guard and then he would
like raise up and lift them up,

1263
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,060
slammed them down.

1264
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,730
And at the same time
ricochet and to elbows.

1265
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,470
Nobody else has ever done that.

1266
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,370
He would be in the guard.

1267
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,450
Holian pick them up,

1268
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,141
slam them,

1269
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:18,974
and then boom,

1270
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,881
land elbows.

1271
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:21,320
He's got like a crazy little move.

1272
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,550
Know what I'm talking about?

1273
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,690
Yeah,

1274
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,060
I know.

1275
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,100
Smart Dude Man.

1276
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:24,741
And then he decided,

1277
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:25,191
you know what,

1278
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,570
I'm just going to stand up with fools.

1279
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:27,200
And then he just,

1280
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,460
he liked standing up explosive man.

1281
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:29,870
He like,

1282
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,670
he started getting really
good at finishing too.

1283
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:34,160
That's when you know you're
I favor was a wrestler.

1284
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,030
He did,

1285
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,140
uh,

1286
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,781
Abu Dhabi,

1287
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:36,740
2005,

1288
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,690
he went against bowel
and being a black belt.

1289
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,280
He was a blue belt at the time,

1290
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:41,690
but he was at an amazing wrestler.

1291
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:47,180
Stalemated Ballymena stalemate
can beat him cause he was on top.

1292
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,530
He just bounced me and I couldn't
get on top of MS is raising two boys.

1293
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,970
I saw,

1294
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:53,781
I won't say who he was,

1295
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:55,340
who he was wrestling with,

1296
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:56,090
but uh,

1297
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,380
I watched Henner Gracie.

1298
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,500
I'd never seen Jujitsu on that
level where I was white clothes.

1299
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,011
I just had,

1300
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:05,090
I really honestly had never seen
that where he took high level,

1301
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,510
high level monster dudes and
was tapping them at will.

1302
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,680
Mixed martial arts guys.

1303
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,460
Yes.

1304
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,330
Mixed martial arts guys.

1305
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,110
Who Henna.

1306
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,770
Henna Gracie.

1307
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,603
We're at,

1308
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:13,881
uh,

1309
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,140
at the Gracie Academy.

1310
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,780
I've actually never seen that
kind of effortless excellence,

1311
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:18,991
uh,

1312
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,261
with,

1313
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:22,130
with guys who were just huge and strong.

1314
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,310
Yeah.

1315
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,720
Henry are very,

1316
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:24,370
very good.

1317
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,370
That's very good.

1318
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,970
I love raised from the time you're a baby.

1319
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:29,690
Your Dad,

1320
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,480
how could they not talk to them?

1321
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:34,120
That's what they've been
doing it since they were in.

1322
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,140
And I talked to him about that and I said,

1323
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:36,851
you know,

1324
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,430
you seem to be

1325
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,410
like you're chunking information.

1326
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:42,480
So what happens is as
soon as they do something,

1327
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,320
you've already been there.

1328
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:45,570
You know exactly what's going
on in your way ahead of me.

1329
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:45,751
He goes,

1330
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:46,584
that's exactly right.

1331
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,450
So his body position is already,

1332
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,493
he's already ahead of you.

1333
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,210
Tell us a steady bravo.

1334
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,831
I was actually going,

1335
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:53,760
that's why I was bringing it up.

1336
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:54,240
I was like,

1337
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,440
that's how it must feel right.

1338
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:55,950
Anyway,

1339
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,491
we really good.

1340
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:57,570
He's getting his heart back.

1341
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,200
She can do some quick claim to,

1342
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,130
so last girl doing the raise the roof.

1343
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,390
Yeah,

1344
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,223
let's just to kiss.

1345
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,330
Kiss and then she draws you in.

1346
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,570
Backhand kiss.

1347
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,890
Oh,

1348
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,210
that's the new shit that
might be on Instagram.

1349
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:18,300
All the bitches going to be doing Mario
Yamasaki is going to be pissed because

1350
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,170
he's not even on mine.

1351
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,300
Why does he do that?

1352
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,851
A hard thing.

1353
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:22,320
Is that to me or write to us?

1354
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,721
There's a rumor.

1355
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:26,670
It's to me it was a rumor going on.

1356
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,623
Hey Mario,

1357
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,490
we did have a talk with the ring card.

1358
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:29,971
Girls come to me.

1359
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:31,710
Something cool a sir.

1360
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,960
Try not to shave the middle
of your head like that.

1361
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,280
Alcantara I was back.

1362
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,370
Very little flexibility trying to work
that rubber guard and it's like a rubber

1363
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:39,450
guard can't get it.

1364
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,650
Look as though was so stiff.

1365
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:43,410
He is and he's that drive you crazy when
you see guys like that when they're in

1366
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,550
this position where men,

1367
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,080
if that dude at some flexibility,

1368
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,850
he had had full control of that spot.

1369
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,710
It doesn't piss me off ever.

1370
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,210
Come on son.

1371
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,140
I mean I'm not pissed.

1372
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,770
I don't mean piss but as [inaudible]
does it like like puzzle you that a gun

1373
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,560
just stretching and there's just too
much to train man that they would,

1374
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,740
if it worked for sure and they saw it
and they didn't have to search for it and

1375
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:07,560
do the research and it was just in
their face that it worked and everyone's

1376
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,250
doing it,

1377
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,083
they would do it.

1378
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,270
But until then stick to
what we already know.

1379
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,380
Let's just keep going.

1380
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,200
Got To work on his striking and
get to get your cardio together.

1381
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,303
Fuck new.

1382
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,510
We don't have time for new shit.

1383
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,190
That's,

1384
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,971
that's what they're feeling.

1385
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:21,511
I understand.

1386
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:21,961
It's weird.

1387
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:23,880
He'd even go forward
if it's not your shit.

1388
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,170
Like if you're not that flexible at it,

1389
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,430
he just found himself.

1390
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:26,670
Yeah,

1391
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,680
he just found himself
in a spot off his back.

1392
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,250
That's right.

1393
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,740
When you're down there and panic and
especially in the first round that's your

1394
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:32,574
go to.

1395
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,523
It's kind of weird.

1396
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,740
You got a good point.

1397
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,170
Anybody can acquire the
flexibility required it.

1398
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,370
Anybody can get into Lotus,

1399
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,520
but you have to put a lot of time into
it and most people aren't willing to put

1400
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:42,300
in the time.

1401
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,770
Where the fuck is John Wayne par?

1402
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,350
See if he's texting me.

1403
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,460
I might be a little late.

1404
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,250
Oh my driving from San Diego.

1405
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,210
Hope that's okay.

1406
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,221
No problem.

1407
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,150
You're world champion brother.

1408
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:54,900
Whatever you say.

1409
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,830
He's a good dude too.

1410
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:57,000
John Wayne parts a good dude.

1411
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,170
I don't know why I love those front kick
so much cause they were just so damned.

1412
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,750
We just joke about them.

1413
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,290
Yeah,

1414
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,260
we made that video and my garage
where you were asking me about.

1415
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:07,951
I'm like dad,

1416
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:08,550
it's the odds.

1417
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,840
You landed it right on the chin.

1418
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,460
Not so good now.

1419
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,100
It killed it.

1420
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,123
I never,

1421
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,580
I don't think in my entire
fight and career ever kicked
someone in the face with

1422
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:18,414
a front kick

1423
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,240
and now everyone's stoner.

1424
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,131
Man,

1425
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:26,280
he just waiting for the chin for
the chance to ever get there on him.

1426
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,680
I never write down the Middle Anderson
when he landed that fucking front kick

1427
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:31,921
on,

1428
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:34,350
Victoria changed the whole world crazy.

1429
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:35,110
Everybody was like,

1430
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,801
oh,

1431
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,040
of

1432
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,210
course I was speech.

1433
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,170
I'll Steven Seagal.

1434
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:38,420
I got,

1435
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,430
I was speechless when I saw that so that
when Liotta landed the jumping front

1436
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:43,201
kick karate,

1437
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,380
they could style crane,

1438
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,060
not fucking Randy coture.

1439
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,891
Up until then,

1440
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:51,340
it wasn't part of your training sessions.

1441
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,550
If you weren't MMA fighter and
you didn't stick that in there,

1442
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,000
you're like,

1443
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
why are you practicing that shit?

1444
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:56,890
It's a waste of your time.

1445
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,280
You know what?

1446
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,710
Nobody would,

1447
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,730
nobody was practicing it,

1448
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,150
you know?

1449
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,770
Now they are.

1450
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,390
Do you know what opened it up a lot in
MMA as opposed to in kickboxing is the,

1451
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:09,160
the takedowns and the worry about
the sprawl and a lowered stance.

1452
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:09,971
There's a,

1453
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:13,750
there's a different approach because guys
are always worried about both things.

1454
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,140
You worried about possible takedowns
so you're training in a different way.

1455
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,580
You're not throwing a lot
of the same techniques.

1456
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:22,570
So you're catching a guy that's like,

1457
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,910
might be leaning forward
a little bit more,

1458
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:25,960
might be of a lower bay,

1459
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,700
might not be able to move back and forth
out of the way is easy because you're

1460
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,500
not seeing it that much in kickboxing.

1461
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,250
You're seeing like a front push kicks
to the face a little bit and some of the

1462
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:37,960
kickboxing bouts and tie bouts,

1463
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,600
you're seeing some of that and
they really don't land right.

1464
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,350
They kind of just,

1465
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,600
they just kind of push
back because they're,

1466
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,600
they have a different stance.

1467
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,920
They'll lean way back,

1468
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,410
they'll lean back light on their feet.

1469
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,101
It's a different,

1470
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:49,090
it's a different style.

1471
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,130
The MMA fighters,

1472
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:52,960
a lot of them are,

1473
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:53,141
uh,

1474
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:53,420
they're,

1475
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,191
they're positioning them.

1476
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:58,420
So like Vitara squares off more because
Vituro is always worried about the

1477
00:39:58,421 --> 00:39:59,020
takedowns.

1478
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,020
And he actually used to teach that at
Carlson Gracie's whose taste the different

1479
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:05,200
stance.

1480
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,441
Like,

1481
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:06,100
he was like,

1482
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,890
you know a lot of these guys,

1483
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,940
he was actually talking about
Maury Smith at the time who was a,

1484
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,730
I think he was the UFC
heavyweight champion.

1485
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,161
Beautiful.

1486
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:12,580
Take tea.

1487
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,960
I think it would be Mark Coleman.

1488
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,833
Yeah,

1489
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,120
right there on his back.

1490
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,320
Willy slip off,

1491
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:18,630
look at the grease slips right off.

1492
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,750
He's way off.

1493
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,700
That's all grease.

1494
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,170
What kind of lost it.

1495
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,233
Yeah.

1496
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,001
But anyway,

1497
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:29,730
Vitto was explaining how Maury still
stands like a kickboxer and that he had a

1498
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,390
square off more and he's like,

1499
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:34,870
you have to learn how to throw all your
punches from almost like a horse dance.

1500
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:36,370
I mean a square stance,

1501
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,960
much less sideways.

1502
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:39,760
And if you look at a guy
like Floyd Mayweather,

1503
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,370
I mean he's coming at
you like Tony Sideways,

1504
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:45,340
completely sideways and it
makes a small target like that,

1505
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:48,700
but get your leg and your leg
kicked out or that's true.

1506
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:50,860
But you could also get
taken down and put the ties.

1507
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,510
Understand where,

1508
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,690
so it's more available and MMA
because of the way people stand.

1509
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,021
Yeah,

1510
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:56,650
definitely.

1511
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,490
Kickboxing there too.

1512
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:58,300
Sideways,

1513
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,640
too sideways and they move back to easy.

1514
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,460
They're moving like too upright.

1515
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,650
They moved like watch like someone like
a like like a real high level Thai guy

1516
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,340
like watch like you know one of those
dudes from like from Gloria what?

1517
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:15,700
Blue cow,

1518
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,211
bull cow.

1519
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:18,820
Poor promac that guy
watch that guy wouldn't.

1520
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,840
When people throw kicks at him and
it's fucking moves back like a snake,

1521
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,460
like the kicks coming towards me,

1522
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:29,280
leanings way back like a snake and then
comes back to your fucking legs out

1523
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,640
money to take you down.

1524
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,410
Then it becomes even more effective.

1525
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,210
Now he's coming in Boone

1526
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,001
so you're going to catch him.

1527
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:35,870
He's going to be open for it.

1528
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,470
If you throw in like if you're,

1529
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:41,210
you're leaning back like the way a lot
of those guys will do and moving back and

1530
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:41,391
forth,

1531
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:44,810
but it's like guys all time that
figuring out when to take you down.

1532
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,560
You know,

1533
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,810
especially if you're
committing forward guys,

1534
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,570
but when you don't have to worry about
strike or you don't have to worry about

1535
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:52,220
takedowns you change your state,

1536
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,770
you change your stance and
it changes what's available.

1537
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,760
Plus with Victor.

1538
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:55,891
He,

1539
00:41:55,891 --> 00:42:00,891
he was more like a wide stance
because vittores a power guy.

1540
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,630
He's trying to knock dudes out second,

1541
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,341
shut up.

1542
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:05,510
He's trying to knock a dude out.

1543
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,250
You know what's interesting
about the tour man,

1544
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,200
he doesn't have big hands at all.

1545
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,400
It doesn't have been a small fee.

1546
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:11,730
It's got like an I eight size eight.

1547
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,540
They're not this,

1548
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,470
they're not big and uh,

1549
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:15,790
it's,

1550
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,250
it's amazing how much power
he's able to generate.

1551
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,300
Like if you watch his fight with like
Scott for Roseau back in the day when he

1552
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:24,410
was 19 school,

1553
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:29,600
I mean he is throwing punches that you
have never seen in his or did he find his

1554
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:31,660
own Gonzaga and fight?

1555
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,081
No,

1556
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:33,290
he didn't fight either one of those guys.

1557
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,650
He fought back in the
day trade talisman men.

1558
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,260
That was his first fight in the UFC
and then right after that he foot's got

1559
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,710
frozen.

1560
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,491
He won the tournament.

1561
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:45,080
He calls it like a heavyweight title,

1562
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,180
but it's not really everyone.

1563
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,010
There was a guy he just machine and
got with the high level kick back.

1564
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,710
Vandelay Silva he just charged across.

1565
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,190
Yeah,

1566
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,990
he hit him with a powder left hand.

1567
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:54,410
Yes.

1568
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,580
He was just so much faster than,

1569
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:55,791
oh,

1570
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:56,830
that was a big head kick by.

1571
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,060
I'll um,

1572
00:42:59,090 --> 00:42:59,923
he's like,

1573
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,620
he's,

1574
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,620
he's his hand speed is so goddamn blazing
fast that if he catches you with one,

1575
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,711
we'd just,

1576
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:06,960
we'll,

1577
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,340
we'll it to you with 40 more
behind it before you can react.

1578
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,630
That's what he did to van Italy.

1579
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,130
He literally ran out.

1580
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,320
I'm like chain punched
style right across the,

1581
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:15,950
the October.

1582
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,120
I wonder what v Tor does.

1583
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:19,480
If he loses loses to Whiteman,

1584
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,360
where,

1585
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,350
where does he go from the,

1586
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,590
it's going to be hard for him to go off
TRT after you know how many years of

1587
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:27,261
being on it.

1588
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:28,550
Like hardcore cause he was,

1589
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:29,300
you know,

1590
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,400
his numbers were high so he's,

1591
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:31,990
he's,

1592
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,840
he's getting off of what,

1593
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:35,300
as a really high toes,

1594
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,110
high desk.

1595
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:36,943
Look at that.

1596
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:38,923
Oh Shit.

1597
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,180
Nice needs the buy.

1598
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:42,014
Love those.

1599
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,270
Can you need inside the rectal area?

1600
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,600
It's very good question.

1601
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,301
It's like the cop,

1602
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:49,380
they're not going to stop
you right in the home.

1603
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,361
I can stop you.

1604
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm going to stop.

1605
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,590
You going to,

1606
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,401
excuse me sir.

1607
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:53,990
Guy Squeeze to the rectum.

1608
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:54,824
No worries.

1609
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,410
You can need like the ass cheeks for sure.

1610
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:57,861
For sure.

1611
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,880
Hurt when you cough.

1612
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,700
You can get all up in that as well.

1613
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,851
What the fuck were we,

1614
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:05,380
you were saying that Vitara versus why,

1615
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,360
but you know it's,

1616
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:06,770
it's,

1617
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,191
I just,

1618
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:08,660
I don't know how he's
going to be able to do,

1619
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:08,921
you don't,

1620
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:10,730
that's the reality of getting old man.

1621
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,020
If you're not on some sort of
hormonal replacement in Europe,

1622
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:19,021
(373) 083-0940 four it starts getting
up there and your entire career you've

1623
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:22,010
been using some sort
of hormonal assistance.

1624
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,190
I mean it's not like you're not even
talking about a guy who's been entirely

1625
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:27,260
natural and talking about a guy who,

1626
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,621
oh,

1627
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:31,780
this dude is taken a big tar
is getting blasting this,

1628
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,100
getting

1629
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,230
the healthy rubber neck like his own

1630
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,560
little separate that the old blossom,

1631
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,460
just get that little slippery here.

1632
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,450
Double outside ashy slip,

1633
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:43,850
right.

1634
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,870
What is called double outside?

1635
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:46,261
Ashy.

1636
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:47,360
What does that the leg position.

1637
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,483
Oh son,

1638
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,320
who,

1639
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,153
who,

1640
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,150
who invented it?

1641
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,233
I said Japanese.

1642
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:57,390
It's a position that existed as long
as catch wrestling and all that shit

1643
00:44:57,391 --> 00:44:57,811
existed.

1644
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:58,644
It's nothing new.

1645
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,623
Why did I just learned?

1646
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,260
I just learned the proper name.

1647
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,363
Why is it ashy?

1648
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:03,751
I don't know,

1649
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:04,021
man.

1650
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:04,854
That's a good question.

1651
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,810
Is it a judo thing or is it a,

1652
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,280
what's the origin?

1653
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,143
I don't know.

1654
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,300
Cause all those Hari Goshi and decided
I'm going to learn those names one of

1655
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:16,650
these days and be a beast.

1656
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,580
I'll tell you what I'm more excited
for than even Pacquiao Mayweather is.

1657
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:24,360
I've been talking Shit to count about
his taekwondo days for years now.

1658
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,680
His wife has proof,

1659
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,820
I guess of what?

1660
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:27,001
Oh,

1661
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:27,241
look at.

1662
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,280
Look at the past.

1663
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,320
We had our pictures of me.

1664
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,860
Ah,

1665
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,770
she has pictures of him
probably flying through the air.

1666
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:35,520
Killing a cow.

1667
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,450
That's nothing to be proud of.

1668
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,820
Probably failing is tiny with one hand.

1669
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,193
Sure.

1670
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,610
It sure isn't by the way.

1671
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:42,751
I just,

1672
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:45,520
I been calling him a liar for
years now and then is my bad.

1673
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,360
It's like everything really.

1674
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,290
Taekwondo though.

1675
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,041
What did you,

1676
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,090
did you really get a black belt?

1677
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,140
I was a master.

1678
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,363
Come on,

1679
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,413
come on.

1680
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,690
I don't know what his rank master.

1681
00:45:57,691 --> 00:45:58,524
What does that mean?

1682
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,061
Let me back.

1683
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:02,210
I went back to like
how long did you train?

1684
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,830
Probably seven years straight.

1685
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,210
Seven years straight.

1686
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:07,500
And where were you living
with your colleagues?

1687
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,870
Is College all through college?

1688
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,140
You must have been training when I met
you then and then three years after it

1689
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:14,370
probably just just stop.

1690
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:14,790
But I wasn't,

1691
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:15,720
I wasn't sparring then.

1692
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,190
I'd probably stop just then.

1693
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,680
So when do you get your black belt?

1694
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,680
A 1987 so how many years are we
training before you got your buck up?

1695
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:25,950
Two and a half.

1696
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,910
That sounds ridiculous.

1697
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:27,920
Yeah,

1698
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,651
it's pretty fast.

1699
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:28,920
Huh?

1700
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,090
That doesn't even sound logical.

1701
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,680
You're the Bj Penn at Taekwondo,

1702
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:31,770
Huh?

1703
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,603
Now Tech,

1704
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,260
you get your back up pretty quick.

1705
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:34,821
I don't know where you are.

1706
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:35,011
Right?

1707
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:36,370
But a lot faster.

1708
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,060
You get a 14 year olds.

1709
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,650
But that's kind of the idea is that

1710
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:42,421
when you get your black belt,

1711
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:43,500
then you're a student.

1712
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:43,891
You know?

1713
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:45,100
Now you're ready to learn.

1714
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,860
I actually got mine in two years.

1715
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,623
Really?

1716
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,830
I knew you were masking it with me.

1717
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:51,780
Yeah,

1718
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,470
you can do it.

1719
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,990
Especially when you're 15
when I was 15 I got my,

1720
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,760
before I was 17 I had mine.

1721
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:02,090
I'm seeing you pay for it in advance
to pay for the black belt course.

1722
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,690
Three years you pay for it,

1723
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,800
you're good at some places.

1724
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:08,850
That sounds like some bullshit and then
there was point fighting fighting and

1725
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:09,421
versus like,

1726
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:11,430
you know actually hitting each other.

1727
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,660
But you know what man,

1728
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:13,810
it's like a lot of you,

1729
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,690
what you pick up when you're
young as far as like your bill.

1730
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,560
Oh dude,

1731
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:18,810
left counter,

1732
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,643
left Tan.

1733
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,633
A lot of like,

1734
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,970
you know your ability to learn and shit.

1735
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,640
It's like so much better when
your body is still growing.

1736
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,910
You know you like your,

1737
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,040
your body's like growing,

1738
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,190
throwing kicks.

1739
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,210
It's like so easy.

1740
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,920
You could take a 14 year old,

1741
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,440
you teach them a little bit
of taekwondo in two years.

1742
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:37,150
They look like a wizard that's throwing,

1743
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:38,260
jumping wheel kicks.

1744
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,630
Take a 40 year old and teach them.

1745
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:41,860
Tiguan died two years.

1746
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:44,610
He looks like a 40 year old that
just learn taekwondo differ.

1747
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,400
He gets stuff for,

1748
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,440
actually I did taekwondo for a year.

1749
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,880
I thought it was going
to be like bloodsport,

1750
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:49,660
I want to be.

1751
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,370
I did.

1752
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,820
I wanted to be John Claude van Damme,

1753
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:52,631
so my dad took me,

1754
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:53,710
my brother Taekwondo,

1755
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,360
and they had me punching like this,

1756
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:56,120
you know,

1757
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,040
black like this.

1758
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,341
I said,

1759
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:57,820
I'm the fuck,

1760
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,100
fuck this noise and left after a year

1761
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,093
after year.

1762
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,240
That's what we started with and then
my dad forced me to go for probably the

1763
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:08,110
next eight months.

1764
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,190
It's these schools,

1765
00:48:09,191 --> 00:48:09,670
man,

1766
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,570
it's like there's a lot of them that are
just maximizing their in their income,

1767
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,720
but just trying to get as many students
as they can and they're not teaching the

1768
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:20,230
style that was a taekwondo originally was,

1769
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,640
which most people will quit.

1770
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,230
They'll quit because he got hard.

1771
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:23,651
Yeah.

1772
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,484
It's too hard.

1773
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,643
It's too hard.

1774
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,550
You get kicked.

1775
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,560
Getting kicked.

1776
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,393
Sucks.

1777
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,620
Most,

1778
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:29,861
yeah.

1779
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,960
Most of what you're
doing is getting kicked.

1780
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,090
Dudes went to sleep in
my school all the time.

1781
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:37,750
You always nervous every time you thought
accidentally people would knock people

1782
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,850
out accidentally on purpose too,

1783
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,980
but accidentally friends
would knock friends out.

1784
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:43,120
I've seen it happen many times.

1785
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,670
When I pass the test for my first green
stripe on my white belt in karate.

1786
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,710
The remark on the test,

1787
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:55,711
I passed the test and they said that a
fantastic overhand knife strike like that

1788
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:59,020
was my shit and that my
story and I'm thinking,

1789
00:48:59,021 --> 00:48:59,530
fuck,

1790
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,260
I'm telling my friends
that I got to fucking

1791
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,740
actually thought someone fucked with me.

1792
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:07,390
I got to go to my go to first.

1793
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,400
I'm going to go.

1794
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,060
Did you use it in the sparring?

1795
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:13,960
Did use it in spar?

1796
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:14,940
Spar?

1797
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,773
It was karate.

1798
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,790
She say nothing at all.

1799
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,570
No sparring.

1800
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,100
I'm going to make an assumption here.

1801
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:26,170
I would assume because
you guys are in taekwondo,

1802
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,120
you guys weren't,

1803
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,260
don't take the wrong way,

1804
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,160
but you guys weren't good at other sports.

1805
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:30,910
How does,

1806
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:31,631
that's adorable.

1807
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:32,050
How's it good?

1808
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:32,740
Is that true?

1809
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:32,981
No,

1810
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:33,611
it was good at everything.

1811
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:35,110
I did really good football,

1812
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:35,651
basketball,

1813
00:49:35,651 --> 00:49:36,071
baseball,

1814
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:36,511
baseball.

1815
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,810
I played baseball as good at baseball.

1816
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,200
The reason why I got into taekwondo
is cause I was at Fenway Park to see a

1817
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:42,034
baseball game.

1818
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,550
What else?

1819
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,540
Leaving and yeah,

1820
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:44,620
I was obsessed with baseball.

1821
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,100
I loved it.

1822
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,150
Played all the time when I was a kid,

1823
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,050
little league and all that shit.

1824
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,430
And then when I was leaving,

1825
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,540
uh,

1826
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,230
I was,

1827
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,840
I could hit a ball fucking far dude.

1828
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:55,810
When I was a kid I had like good,

1829
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,730
like home run power as a little,

1830
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,573
is that right

1831
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:01,580
with his hips?

1832
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,020
Like it all,

1833
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,900
it's translated into kicking and punching.

1834
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,561
But I,

1835
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:05,891
you know,

1836
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,200
like I was obsessed
with hitting home runs.

1837
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,980
I struck out or I hit home runs,

1838
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:10,840
Babe Ruth,

1839
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,420
a single fucking coach
ever got into my head.

1840
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,200
They're all like,

1841
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,471
look,

1842
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:15,820
I need to get on first base.

1843
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:16,121
I go,

1844
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:16,540
okay,

1845
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,010
okay.

1846
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:17,650
Okay.

1847
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,560
Pitch comes swinging for
the fucking moon every time.

1848
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,710
I didn't care if I struck out and
cause I was a terrible team player.

1849
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:23,910
Yeah.

1850
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,240
I didn't give a fuck if we lost,

1851
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:26,470
I'm hitting a home run.

1852
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,410
That one is home right now.

1853
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,251
My coach,

1854
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:32,180
they would pull me aside.

1855
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:32,421
He goes,

1856
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:32,690
look man,

1857
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,260
you got seven home runs at 89 strike out.

1858
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,163
That's what I,

1859
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,293
I either,

1860
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,810
I either knocked that fucking hilarious,

1861
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:42,680
but when I hit it,

1862
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:42,951
dude,

1863
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:43,491
people would go,

1864
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:45,110
Holy Shit,

1865
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,660
I got addicted to that
feeling of people going,

1866
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:48,410
Holy Shit.

1867
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,960
So he played baseball it til when?

1868
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,800
A 15.

1869
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,910
Because when I was,

1870
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,720
when I was realizing that I could hit
the ball harder than most people my size,

1871
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,583
it became my thing.

1872
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,850
I get so excited about it.

1873
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,500
So it a practice obsessive Lee and
then coming home from a baseball game,

1874
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,690
we went to see the red sox at Fenway Park.

1875
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:08,480
There was the line for the teeth
because it was a summertime.

1876
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,560
There's always people walk in,

1877
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:11,930
everybody took the t
and it was a long line.

1878
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:14,480
You'd have to wait like 45 minutes
to get on the fucking train.

1879
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:15,960
Just piles of people.

1880
00:51:15,961 --> 00:51:19,580
All these drunks piling out of Fenway
Park Cause Fenway Park is right down the

1881
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:21,140
street from the a the t stop.

1882
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,670
So we were walking home and we'd pass
by the j Hunt Kim Taekwondo Institute.

1883
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:26,751
So,

1884
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:27,170
uh,

1885
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,280
I was already taking karate.

1886
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,750
I was taking karate at a
Joe Esposito's in Newton,

1887
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:33,770
Massachusetts.

1888
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,551
But it's hard to get there.

1889
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:34,791
There was,

1890
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,580
it wasn't good public
transportation there.

1891
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:37,220
I,

1892
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,970
I get to the top of the
stairs as we're walking up,

1893
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,073
I'm hearing

1894
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,510
like these change,

1895
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,344
Chink,

1896
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,190
like cause the bag's going in the air
and then the chain is like stopping it

1897
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:54,191
from swinging lump and I go up
and as just total synchronicity,

1898
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,200
the time I show up at the school
was the time that John Lee,

1899
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,131
who was at the time,

1900
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:05,780
the most devastating student that Mr.
Kim hat as far as like knockout power,

1901
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,560
he was this really tall black dude
from a really bad neighborhood.

1902
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:12,770
He was like a street guy who learn
martial arts learning to fight.

1903
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:16,400
He had a spinning back
kick that was unhealthy.

1904
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:16,940
God.

1905
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,170
This Day people say,

1906
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:18,470
my,

1907
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,850
my spinning backaches really good.

1908
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:20,684
I'm telling you,

1909
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,610
if you saw this
motherfucker kicked the bag,

1910
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,390
you would go,

1911
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,560
oh,

1912
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,640
that's where I got it from.

1913
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,470
I got it from my first impressions.

1914
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,550
Well he taught me to,

1915
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,780
he taught me a lot of shit.

1916
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:31,070
John taught me a lot of shit.

1917
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:31,380
I,

1918
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:31,690
we,

1919
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,740
I went to a lot of tournaments with
them actually when I was young,

1920
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:34,603
when I was older,

1921
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,930
but I walked up when he was prepared was
the national champion at the time and

1922
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:40,370
he was preparing for the World Cup.

1923
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,760
So as I walked up the stairs it was like
him and his final preparations for the

1924
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,120
World Cup and it was just boom,

1925
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,100
just fucking this bag up.

1926
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:53,870
This hundred pound bag was flying
through the air and bending in half.

1927
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,011
And I remember thinking,

1928
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:56,360
I never saw anybody do anything.

1929
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:57,291
That's crazy.

1930
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:59,390
I've never seen anybody do
anything like this before.

1931
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:04,750
And it was all about bag work cause Mr.
Kim was like adamant about bag work and

1932
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,700
he's like everybody throws kicks in
the area that you've got to build

1933
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:08,534
resistance,

1934
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,700
you have to hit things heavy things.

1935
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:15,590
He had a 200 pound bag know a series of
hundred pound bags and it's 200 pound

1936
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:19,770
bag that was like as big around as Joey
Diaz and it was like seven feet telling

1937
00:53:19,771 --> 00:53:21,590
you to kick the shit out
of this fucking thing.

1938
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,880
And that was his thing man.

1939
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:24,230
It's just building power.

1940
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,070
So I became

1941
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,610
obsessed.

1942
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,540
So you saw that and said,

1943
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:27,901
Fuck Bay,

1944
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:28,620
quit risks,

1945
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,453
wrestling,

1946
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,780
quit baseball,

1947
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:31,381
quit everything.

1948
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:32,490
I was doing a bunch of sports,

1949
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,260
but how dare you think
I wasn't good at sports?

1950
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:34,890
No,

1951
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,723
it's not that I,

1952
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,800
it was more like in my neighborhood,

1953
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:38,790
if he did taekwondo,

1954
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:41,200
you weren't good at anything
else because it was a,

1955
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:41,911
you know what I'm saying?

1956
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:42,691
Cause you,

1957
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:43,800
it's not a team sport.

1958
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:44,940
You're not going to get picked on.

1959
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:45,481
So it's like,

1960
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:45,900
all right,

1961
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,920
well what can he do?

1962
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,920
Let's put this little
bastard in Taekwondo Denver.

1963
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,970
Denver's like taekwondo.

1964
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,050
Not exactly heartland.

1965
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,390
It all depends.

1966
00:53:57,391 --> 00:53:59,640
Every martial art depends
on what school you go to.

1967
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,950
You can go to a dog shit
Jujitsu school and it's,

1968
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:02,161
you know,

1969
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:03,060
it's better than nothing,

1970
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,180
but you're going to learn some
shitty technique a lot of the times.

1971
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:06,291
Yeah.

1972
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:07,740
And that's the same with karate.

1973
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,791
And that's the same way we talk.

1974
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:08,911
Well,

1975
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:09,061
no,

1976
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,860
I just got stupid lucky man.

1977
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,020
I was in the right
place at the right time.

1978
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:13,590
I mean,

1979
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,970
you can't get a better time.

1980
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,990
This guy was kicking up the fucking
shit out of this bag and I just stood.

1981
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,421
The way the,

1982
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:20,251
the gym is set up,

1983
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:24,180
you'd get to the top of the stairs is an
area where you'd take her shoes off and

1984
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:28,440
that area was right where the heavy bags
where it was by design because Mr. Kim

1985
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:32,550
wanted people to walk up the stairs and
see someone murdering the bag and sign

1986
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:33,100
up.

1987
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,230
The desk is right there.

1988
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,910
So that's where John was working out.

1989
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,140
And like you'd go,

1990
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:37,471
first of all,

1991
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:38,930
you see a guy who's a black poly like boy,

1992
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,720
he's a fucking black.

1993
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,001
Yeah,

1994
00:54:40,001 --> 00:54:40,320
yeah.

1995
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,190
But you see a black was actually doing
real black belt shit that you expect a

1996
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:46,270
black belt to do that.

1997
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,770
So that was how I got hooked with one
because if I came up there and it's some

1998
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:51,780
fucking kid's class and they're like,

1999
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:52,683
yeah,

2000
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,830
that was my experience.

2001
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,070
I would have been later.

2002
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,730
I would have been so close
and make a lot of money.

2003
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,800
Teach just forms and 0.5
because you know you can,

2004
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:04,650
you can have a lot of money.

2005
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:05,760
You can get your black button right away.

2006
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:06,060
But,

2007
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,720
but when,

2008
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,920
when we were hitting each other,

2009
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,630
those gyms have a hard time.

2010
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,760
John didn't remember any of his forms.

2011
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:12,990
That's one of the things
that I've learned.

2012
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:13,920
Like John Leaks,

2013
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:14,880
he's from Chelsea.

2014
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,320
It was a terrible neighborhood.

2015
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,610
It didn't know any forms.

2016
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,361
It was man.

2017
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:20,310
I remember new thing just
until I can forget them.

2018
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:21,840
You remember that Shit.

2019
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,390
He would laugh about it.

2020
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,730
It was like total street guy.

2021
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,200
Like he's a good dude man.

2022
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,820
He had a lot of you played sports.

2023
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,030
I played sports on my street.

2024
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,433
Yeah.

2025
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,523
Yeah.

2026
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,490
I played football all the goddamn time
on the streets with other Mexican people,

2027
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,650
my size and the older and stuff.

2028
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,023
But then once,

2029
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,810
and I,

2030
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,870
and I played little league or
junior all American football.

2031
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,850
So when I was nine I played middle
linebacker and defense event.

2032
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,600
Dope.

2033
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,590
Actually thought I was going to grow
up to be a football player and play,

2034
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,030
maybe Middle Linebacker,

2035
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,140
maybe quarterback,

2036
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,900
maybe defensive and like I
was so delusional as a kid,

2037
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,380
junior,

2038
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,670
all American football does that.

2039
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,430
It makes you think like it took off.

2040
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,260
I tried to play football my freshman year.

2041
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,400
I get into pads,

2042
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:15,121
I'm in New England,

2043
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,440
it's so cold and I just,

2044
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,400
I want to be a football player.

2045
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,650
I literally was a hundred and what?

2046
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,920
Literally 110 pounds and
my father was so huge,

2047
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,010
I thought I was going to grow up to

2048
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,431
be like him.

2049
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:25,264
So it's just a question of,

2050
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:25,630
you know,

2051
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,140
growing into that and I,

2052
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,910
I was,

2053
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:30,040
I was getting hit and it
was so cold in my head.

2054
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,360
I was running away from the place and
then a guy carry lane came to me and he

2055
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:34,690
said,

2056
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:35,560
you have to rustle.

2057
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,630
You're just wrestle people your size.

2058
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,030
What are you do on our foot?

2059
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:43,900
Change in my life was our football coach
was the assistant wrestling coach and

2060
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,850
this mother fucker would
always try to recruit people.

2061
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:45,980
Yeah.

2062
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,240
He's like,

2063
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,640
Grogan,

2064
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,590
you're a tough bastard.

2065
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:48,460
He should be out there.

2066
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,230
You should be out there
on the fucking field.

2067
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,350
But we had a guy in our football or
in our wrestling team that was our

2068
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:53,950
heavyweight.

2069
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:54,250
Yeah,

2070
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,750
he was 300 pounds.

2071
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,251
Bobby Baker.

2072
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,840
He was 300 pounds in high school.

2073
00:56:58,841 --> 00:56:59,621
And I'm not joking.

2074
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:00,520
It wasn't lean.

2075
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,001
Okay.

2076
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,350
But he was a giant.

2077
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,760
He was a giant dude.

2078
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,530
I go and I just stood right next to him.

2079
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:05,741
I go,

2080
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:06,790
he plays football.

2081
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,231
I go,

2082
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:08,441
look,

2083
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:10,830
I play wrestle one 34 right?

2084
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,670
He's 300 pounds.

2085
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,100
Awesome.

2086
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:13,451
Fuck you.

2087
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:14,020
I'm not there.

2088
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,221
No one.

2089
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:15,280
No one's breaking me.

2090
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:17,590
I'm not having someone run
over me and smashed me.

2091
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,453
No thanks.

2092
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:18,780
Oh,

2093
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,100
there's going to be giving a talk.

2094
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,010
We Love Reus Tom.

2095
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,050
There's nothing will copy it off.

2096
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,070
That's another different
kind of white dude.

2097
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,311
Yeah.

2098
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:24,500
He,

2099
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,040
Israel Martinez is that guy
that Donald Serone head kicked.

2100
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,551
Oh,

2101
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,330
that's right.

2102
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,200
This was his last fight,

2103
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:29,650
right?

2104
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,251
I believe so.

2105
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:33,760
I don't know if Martine's is fought on
one of the undercards I wasn't aware of.

2106
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,040
There's so many fights going
on as we were talking about.

2107
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,700
If you're,

2108
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,510
you know,

2109
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,500
fight pass,

2110
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:39,520
you know,

2111
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,100
between the,

2112
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,130
the prelims on Fox
sports one and all that.

2113
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,550
He's responsible for two of
the most stomach churning
submissions in the history

2114
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,384
of the UFC.

2115
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:52,920
Why?

2116
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,501
What's the other one?

2117
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:55,630
Tim Silvia snapped this fucking forearm.

2118
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:56,890
Half Demon.

2119
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:57,610
No it right.

2120
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,910
He wanted to keep going and then on
people that knew something was wrong.

2121
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:01,130
Yeah,

2122
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,690
he did that crazy Americana
from the guard kind of thing.

2123
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:05,763
That was awesome.

2124
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,960
Frank Mir is one of the
reasons I started fighting.

2125
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,430
No one's ever done that again.

2126
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,750
Have you ever pulled that off?

2127
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:12,610
That Americana from full guard?

2128
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,030
No.

2129
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,010
No guys did it after that.

2130
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:16,330
They were fucking around with it.

2131
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,441
I remember guys,

2132
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:20,650
we're fucking around with it in
class like right after that fight.

2133
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,730
I mean from full good.

2134
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:25,990
It'd be tough to a very complex setup.

2135
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:30,370
He paid someone who did more
good when it sold it off.

2136
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:30,941
You know,

2137
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,560
you don't think a wrist locks work.

2138
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:33,830
You think wrist locks or Ooh,

2139
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,580
acute old Dell.

2140
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,920
But Fred [inaudible],

2141
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,960
he put lock or a wrist
locks you from full guard.

2142
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:41,531
He showed me,

2143
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:42,364
man,

2144
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,483
fuck,

2145
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,470
this is real shit.

2146
00:58:47,471 --> 00:58:51,270
Wrist locks sound like something doesn't
make fun of and no one really tells him

2147
00:58:51,271 --> 00:58:51,500
though.

2148
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,740
There are certain girls,

2149
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,690
they get obsessed with them and they
pull them off guard and they were really

2150
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:55,911
good.

2151
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:59,410
You got to watch your rails and they'll
use them to set up other things because

2152
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,410
you have to spread it on your wrist and
you know he'd pull it back to this set

2153
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:02,510
up.

2154
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,120
Others Cellos,

2155
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,850
man submitted Cameron
Earl with a wrist lock.

2156
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,170
One of the trips we went to,

2157
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,270
what was it like a wrist
lock from an Omoplata?

2158
00:59:10,271 --> 00:59:10,781
I don't know.

2159
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:11,381
I don't remember.

2160
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:11,890
Do you know what I mean?

2161
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:12,723
You got

2162
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,590
have you enrolled with that?

2163
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,390
I sound like I say it's online.

2164
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,260
Bitch.

2165
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,093
Google it.

2166
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,910
It is,

2167
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:19,260
Eh.

2168
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,440
He'd beat my ass.

2169
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,460
You can watch it on youtube.

2170
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:23,061
He's that good.

2171
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:24,800
He's just that I can got a,

2172
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,660
there's a wizard a wizard.

2173
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:27,494
Huh?

2174
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,870
There's a lot of high level guys now man.

2175
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,250
I was so impressed watching Gary Tone
and Havi so I'm so impressed with the

2176
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:34,910
hobby.

2177
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,331
Hobbies.

2178
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:36,740
Defense is incredible.

2179
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,450
How relaxed he is.

2180
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,790
And that guy's mounting him
and going after leg locks,

2181
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,230
but he's bigger than Havi.

2182
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:43,310
Right by quite a bit.

2183
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,120
They were saying we're
announcing the weigh ins.

2184
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,260
They were saying one 45 and one 70 I
don't know if that's accurate though.

2185
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:56,950
I would say hobby would hobby was not
one 45 I would say it was one 65 one 70

2186
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,890
somebody must've just
erroneously stated that.

2187
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:04,900
I would say since I wasn't a weight limit
and and Gary Tone and cuts down to 70

2188
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:06,883
for some fights,

2189
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,660
I would say he might've been,

2190
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,990
he could have been one 75 one 80 maybe.

2191
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:12,501
I don't know.

2192
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:13,610
He so he's looked big.

2193
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,990
It looked a lot bigger than a hobby,

2194
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:15,771
but God damn,

2195
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:17,180
that triangle was a thing of beauty,

2196
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:17,480
man.

2197
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:17,751
Gary,

2198
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:18,111
tons.

2199
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:19,500
Fucking everybody up.

2200
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,271
So good.

2201
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:21,470
God Damn.

2202
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:22,490
He's just ripping through.

2203
01:00:22,491 --> 01:00:24,200
Everybody's submitting everybody.

2204
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,730
I remember when you came on the podcast,

2205
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:28,550
so you talked about that
match that he had with crone.

2206
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,120
Yeah.

2207
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,110
Oh God.

2208
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:30,691
You ever seen that?

2209
01:00:30,691 --> 01:00:31,311
I haven't seen it.

2210
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:31,731
What happened?

2211
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:34,460
Fucking crooners up fucking madman.

2212
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,150
Nightmare.

2213
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:35,750
He's up.

2214
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:39,050
Matt was on crone was beating him.

2215
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:40,250
He was about to get beat.

2216
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,960
He got his back.

2217
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,580
He was all over chrome.

2218
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:43,941
How long?

2219
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:44,980
Never seen crawling.

2220
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,040
It was,

2221
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,270
it went to the last second,

2222
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,580
the last second he was down,

2223
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:49,910
dude,

2224
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:50,241
he had,

2225
01:00:50,241 --> 01:00:52,160
it was like a a minute left.

2226
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:53,030
I forget now.

2227
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:53,601
It's been a while,

2228
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:54,710
but there was like a minute left.

2229
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,511
They separated,

2230
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:58,820
they stood and crump and
was was going to win.

2231
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,880
There's he a cro needed to submit them.

2232
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:06,680
So with them within a minute he looks
over at Hixson and he says he just does it

2233
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:06,891
man.

2234
01:01:06,891 --> 01:01:06,971
He,

2235
01:01:06,971 --> 01:01:07,460
he gets,

2236
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,241
he takes him down,

2237
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:11,180
gets his back and chokes him out
with like a second life special.

2238
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,040
When I was getting ready for a metamorris
crone was also on the card and so I'd

2239
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:19,700
go to his gym and train with them and I
remember when we got done afterwards I

2240
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:22,190
was looking over and he's doing
these breathing techniques.

2241
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:22,491
I was like,

2242
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:22,731
damn,

2243
01:01:22,731 --> 01:01:26,870
this motherfucker's are Real
Samurai white dude from Denver.

2244
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,400
Like trying to do his shit.

2245
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,220
You know his heart rate
down and look at his dad.

2246
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:32,300
You've seen the movie choke.

2247
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,650
Where's dad works on that stuff?

2248
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:34,160
Yeah,

2249
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,030
you should learn that shit,

2250
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:35,271
man.

2251
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:36,890
That's an interesting thing to learn.

2252
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,150
The breathing to breathing,

2253
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:39,800
yet he does it all the time he took,

2254
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,760
he took me through it.

2255
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,390
It's just,

2256
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,631
you know,

2257
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,160
you got to do it all the time.

2258
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:44,720
It's become part of your game.

2259
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,520
You've got to master your abs somehow.

2260
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,540
Such a beast,

2261
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:47,900
man.

2262
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,350
Crone.

2263
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,030
He's a special special dude.

2264
01:01:50,031 --> 01:01:50,360
Yeah.

2265
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,193
Imagine that.

2266
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:53,150
Just the Jeanette Dicks,

2267
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,850
his genetics.

2268
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:55,131
I mean,

2269
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:55,521
come on.

2270
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:56,020
So you're,

2271
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,850
you're born into the
greatest Jujitsu family.

2272
01:01:58,851 --> 01:01:59,600
Fuck that.

2273
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,420
The greatest martial arts
family by a long shot.

2274
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,780
Like what's the second greatest martial
arts family other than the Gracies.

2275
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,810
And how about your dad is Hixon you know,

2276
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,090
dad's not Helson.

2277
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:10,933
I'm playing the flute.

2278
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,050
Your Dad's not Carlson.

2279
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:12,980
What if you did though?

2280
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,570
What if you were all
into the flute and Dude's

2281
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:17,993
Oh,

2282
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:19,320
oh,

2283
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,681
come on.

2284
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:20,160
Flowers

2285
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,390
are not all with the fact that
you called it a five degree.

2286
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,220
What if you wear a scarf and wearing
to flutes and in you're a Gracie,

2287
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,890
like Hixon scientist.

2288
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:30,421
You just say,

2289
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:30,791
fuck.

2290
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:31,300
Just dying.

2291
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:36,300
Dying to get the word flutist out all
mine if it right in my throat all year.

2292
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,660
How many times on here do you use flowers?

2293
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,810
I had a good year.

2294
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,430
A crazy flout filled year.

2295
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,800
I bet he said you say it every
time on your own podcast.

2296
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,081
Yeah,

2297
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:48,540
I started,

2298
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:48,930
I started,

2299
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,820
I started my own buck as
everything because it's really,

2300
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,620
unless I go,

2301
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,291
I have to say,

2302
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:55,830
I've always fantasized about being
a flutist and now the Prime Kevin?

2303
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:55,981
No.

2304
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:56,850
If you had to be honest,

2305
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:59,670
like how many times a year do you
think you break out the word flutist?

2306
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,720
Um,

2307
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,840
it is a word that I think about a lot
and I just never have time to really

2308
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:04,950
working in until just now.

2309
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,050
Cause I don't have sophisticated company.

2310
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,530
I'm pretty sure that that's the only
time I've ever said it is repeating.

2311
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:11,364
You just know.

2312
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,550
Yeah.

2313
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:16,090
I don't think it'd be on flowers,

2314
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,270
but I expect that with a guy
that came in with a scarf.

2315
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,120
Cashmere is 100% we went deer hunting.

2316
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:22,020
He was wearing cashmere,

2317
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,150
he just called himself
the cashmere killer.

2318
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,790
He's in Montana tested killer.

2319
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:32,660
He killed her to really one of the
most desolate spots in North America.

2320
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:33,691
I mean,

2321
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:34,800
it's fucking wilderness.

2322
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:35,730
There's no one out there.

2323
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,160
He's wearing cashmere can't,

2324
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:39,090
you can't grow anything.

2325
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:42,180
You get to the top of a mountain and
you know when you looked at for deer and

2326
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:42,950
you look off,

2327
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:43,340
I like,

2328
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,300
like how remote you are,

2329
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,320
like the area you're in.

2330
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,970
It's pretty cool.

2331
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:48,960
It's really weird.

2332
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:51,000
And then you look over and
there's county Kashmir,

2333
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:53,700
Kashmir and his cell phone.

2334
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,083
Oh yeah

2335
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:56,360
dude.

2336
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,151
You're in the middle of nowhere.

2337
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:57,811
You can't grow anything.

2338
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:58,920
You're in clay to,

2339
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,840
you walk around in clay.

2340
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:01,674
It's crazy.

2341
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,543
Cat Mud,

2342
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:03,390
clay,

2343
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,280
cactus clay and like Rye.

2344
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:06,180
We'd grow there.

2345
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:06,900
Well you know why it's,

2346
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,681
it's clay.

2347
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:10,290
It's literally the
bottom of an ancient sea.

2348
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,960
It's the great western inland sea.

2349
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,130
These of dinosaurs fucking rolling
around that you find like shells,

2350
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,180
you find like,

2351
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:19,200
like seashells.

2352
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,940
They're millions of years ago.

2353
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:21,774
That was an ocean.

2354
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,591
Eddie,

2355
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:23,280
you don't hunt.

2356
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,540
You don't go with these guys hunting.

2357
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,680
No.

2358
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:25,940
Sorry,

2359
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,400
you're saying it's too big,

2360
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,010
right?

2361
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:29,843
It should be.

2362
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:30,540
Well,

2363
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,630
you just never tried.

2364
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:33,000
It goes down.

2365
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:33,630
You know,

2366
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:34,710
guys didn't know how to hunt.

2367
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,660
Those are the guys you want to be though.

2368
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,040
When you're hunting.

2369
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:41,460
The hunting is the fun
is actually the amount.

2370
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:46,470
You laugh together like you and I laugh
more when we hunt because a lot of times

2371
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:48,390
it's cold and a little bit miserable.

2372
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,580
Well and then they don't
know anybody like us.

2373
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:51,180
Like they didn't know.

2374
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,340
They don't ever have comedians
come hunting with them.

2375
01:04:53,341 --> 01:04:55,950
Other hunters truths of Joe
and I had a captive audience.

2376
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:56,910
They have nowhere to go.

2377
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,050
It's great.

2378
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:58,883
In all fairness,

2379
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,630
I have a captive,

2380
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,590
I mean you have a captive audience and me,

2381
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,470
I bring you along cause
I know he's always on.

2382
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,450
Plus we can talk,

2383
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:06,841
you know,

2384
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:09,900
we could have like real conversations
like especially that first day I'm like,

2385
01:05:09,901 --> 01:05:12,390
I didn't know where these guys
are going to fucking get this key.

2386
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:12,870
You know,

2387
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:13,351
who knows.

2388
01:05:13,351 --> 01:05:14,150
This could be,

2389
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,200
this could be a disaster.

2390
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,070
Who knows what kind of
guys were going with.

2391
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,710
Literally I go there and I go like this.

2392
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:21,460
I got to go,

2393
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,860
oh I'm going to make Joe
Laugh all fucking day.

2394
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,671
That's my job.

2395
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:25,360
All we did,

2396
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,520
all we did was just how laughing,

2397
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:28,540
shoot things.

2398
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,950
And how are you guys laughing?

2399
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:30,551
Oh my God,

2400
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,384
we're crying.

2401
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:33,760
They had a five day
Brian Cowen comedy show.

2402
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:34,961
By the end of it,

2403
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:36,160
they knew the rhythm too.

2404
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:37,420
They knew it was all gay stuff.

2405
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:38,560
So anytime,

2406
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:42,130
anytime they would bend
over to pick up firewood.

2407
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:42,971
Let me help you out here.

2408
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:43,731
You got doing this right?

2409
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,630
You're going to do this hunting shell.

2410
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:47,380
Shh.

2411
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:47,890
What do you,

2412
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,100
what's,

2413
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,440
what's the,

2414
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,273
the hips,

2415
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:51,430
the botox to get the red hair.

2416
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:52,271
That could work better.

2417
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:53,740
A hunting show with that character.

2418
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:54,603
You could do that.

2419
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:55,600
Guides.

2420
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,390
I basically sexually harass
Dan Dodi the whole time.

2421
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:58,780
And it's,

2422
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,220
and it's in these shows.

2423
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:01,103
Oh yeah,

2424
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:02,180
they did.

2425
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,280
They look very little.

2426
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:06,490
[inaudible] what you
see on the show is like,

2427
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:06,961
just the,

2428
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:07,220
the,

2429
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:07,480
the,

2430
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,620
the usable parts.

2431
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:12,430
It's a hunting show and the
sportsmans channel the fucking at all.

2432
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,840
Give me some of that wine to what
kind of wine you got their fellow.

2433
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,021
Oh,

2434
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:17,591
that's a nice,

2435
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:18,424
it's a beautiful,

2436
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,090
the scanner to scan it,

2437
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,521
but it's,

2438
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:21,880
um,

2439
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,970
it's very satisfying.

2440
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:23,230
Yeti.

2441
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:23,810
You would enjoy.

2442
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:24,641
You love meat,

2443
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:25,120
man.

2444
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,700
It'd be,

2445
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,460
I don't love meat that much.

2446
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:28,330
I don't like any game.

2447
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:30,220
Me like elk and I don't
like or you don't know.

2448
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,360
I never had to say that.

2449
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:34,570
You don't know at Fuddruckers
and they got all that shit.

2450
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,880
Just stop right now.

2451
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,800
That's like saying karate doesn't work.

2452
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:41,500
I saw Fred Volare but Eddie,

2453
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:41,711
Eddie,

2454
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:41,921
Eddie.

2455
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:42,631
That's first of all,

2456
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,060
it's farm raised where it's farm raised.

2457
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:48,850
Alchemize via cow that grow those
fucking things in cages in New Zealand.

2458
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,710
They cut the meat up and
they ship it over here.

2459
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:54,880
You're not getting wild elk from North
America because wild elk from North

2460
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:55,241
America,

2461
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:56,050
you can't sell.

2462
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:56,730
I don't like Cam.

2463
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:57,340
Try dated.

2464
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,173
I don't like,

2465
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:59,020
you don't have to camp.

2466
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,190
You could stay on the lodges.

2467
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,241
Stand lodges.

2468
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:03,640
A lot of times you've done it hardcore,

2469
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,460
but we've also done it where we
stay in a house that's different.

2470
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,720
We've done a hardcore twice,

2471
01:07:07,721 --> 01:07:08,554
like hardcore

2472
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,260
jungle Rinella.

2473
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,094
No,

2474
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,370
I'm not in the jungles where you go
to a gentleman and hug like leopards.

2475
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,680
I been to prom is no,

2476
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:18,730
I've been to a jungle.

2477
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:19,420
You don't want to be in.

2478
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,410
You don't want to be in the jungle.

2479
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,071
And I've been in the gym.

2480
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:21,821
I'd rather do that.

2481
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:22,830
I've been in the rain forest.

2482
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:23,970
You like general listening.

2483
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:28,360
He got to hear this because he actually
was working as a bug scientist.

2484
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:28,871
I went,

2485
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:31,660
I went to Indonesia and
went and tracked orangutans.

2486
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:31,900
Let me,

2487
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,640
let me tell you why you never
want to go in the jungle.

2488
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,211
Ever,

2489
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:34,810
ever.

2490
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:35,260
Dude.

2491
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,040
Bugs.

2492
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,300
You'll get eaten by mosquitoes.

2493
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,460
You'd have to carry a sulfur coil,

2494
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,110
not just bug spray,

2495
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,370
a sulfur coil.

2496
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,780
You have to sit in your hammock.

2497
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:45,610
Please don't lie on the ground
because if you're laying the ground,

2498
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:46,420
uh,

2499
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:46,871
leeches,

2500
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:47,621
we'll get into your skin.

2501
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:50,080
And not to mention those
wonderful ants and wasps.

2502
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,370
What about you at the story you told
about putting the Turpentine on the posts

2503
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:54,711
of the,

2504
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:55,050
the,

2505
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:55,300
yeah,

2506
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,770
you have to put per turpentine.

2507
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:00,520
So every house there is raised
up and you put Turpentine,

2508
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,570
you soak the,

2509
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,040
the wood in terms of why?

2510
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:07,330
Because you don't want to be in the
way of the soldier ants when they're

2511
01:08:07,331 --> 01:08:07,661
hunting.

2512
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:08,494
If they're foraging,

2513
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,910
they'll walk right over you.

2514
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,350
If they're hunting,

2515
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:13,690
they will come up those posts.

2516
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:18,870
They will come into a hut and
kill you and they'll jump on you.

2517
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,600
They'll basically cover
you and sting you in your,

2518
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,550
the normal thinking that happens too.

2519
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,420
They kill elephants.

2520
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,840
What they climb in Indonesia
and Africa as well.

2521
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:35,150
They climb into an an elephant's ear
and they'll start eating it's fucking

2522
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:35,840
brain.

2523
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,250
You can hear them coming there.

2524
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,101
That's how many there are.

2525
01:08:38,101 --> 01:08:38,870
I'm from real.

2526
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:39,950
You can hear a buzz.

2527
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:40,784
I go,

2528
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,770
you want to hear a crazy statistic?

2529
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:45,320
Here's a crazy statistic about ants.

2530
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,880
The body mass,

2531
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:49,430
like the weight of ants on earth,

2532
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,540
the amount of ants is exactly the same
or close to it as the weight of people.

2533
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:54,860
Yeah.

2534
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:55,790
That's how many ants there are.

2535
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:56,420
So shitload.

2536
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,430
And now why is,

2537
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,440
how do these Amazon Indian survive these
bugs saying is that the Dayak who I was

2538
01:09:04,131 --> 01:09:04,550
with,

2539
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,600
they don't sweat.

2540
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:06,620
Even though you're sweating,

2541
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:07,340
losing counselor,

2542
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,030
they don't sweat.

2543
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:08,360
They there.

2544
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,590
They've adapted to their environment
so they can and bugs don't.

2545
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,120
The mosquitoes don't really bite them.

2546
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,170
Why?

2547
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:16,670
Because they over millennia,

2548
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,570
they developed a,

2549
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,240
they evolve to develop resistance to bugs,

2550
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,650
to the bugs of that area.

2551
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:24,590
That makes sense.

2552
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,270
Totally makes sense.

2553
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,350
But there's some bugs is still get
them like Rinella was in Bolivia.

2554
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,500
You know Rinella just got back
from Bolivia where he ate a monkey.

2555
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,750
Oh my shot and cooked and ate a monkey.

2556
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:36,261
Not Him,

2557
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:37,340
but the people in the tribe.

2558
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:37,521
No,

2559
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:38,151
he didn't get sick,

2560
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:39,470
but it's disturbing.

2561
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:39,920
Yeah.

2562
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,080
Watching them throw
this monkey on the fire.

2563
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,160
It looks very,

2564
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:48,370
very fucking human monkey
like a chimpanzee or hail.

2565
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,950
You want a little monkey with a tail.

2566
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,380
But he got stung by a bullet ant.

2567
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,960
He was there and he was in agony.

2568
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:57,410
It's

2569
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,243
the worst.

2570
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:58,940
But these,

2571
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:01,640
those guys get stung to as a part
of their coming of age ritual.

2572
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:02,900
They're not immune to that shit now.

2573
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:03,560
They're not.

2574
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,620
WASPS could give a shit how
long you've lived in the area.

2575
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:10,790
It's going to hurt just as much hobby
lobby and our Martine's is an interesting

2576
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:11,120
fight,

2577
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,690
man.

2578
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,300
His hobby lobby's coming off
that loss to Benson Henderson.

2579
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:15,140
It was a close fight.

2580
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:15,770
Yup.

2581
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:16,880
Got pulled into deep water.

2582
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,150
He's beaten good guys.

2583
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:19,520
He beat Jorge Mosbey Dolly.

2584
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,990
Remember he hit him with that weird,

2585
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:22,550
we'll kick really awkward.

2586
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,384
We'll kick.

2587
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,280
It's a really good grappler.

2588
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:26,640
Yeah.

2589
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,190
Real world champion Samba.

2590
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,720
I think he was correct.

2591
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:30,910
And His uh,

2592
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:33,080
suplexes are off the charts.

2593
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:34,040
Throw you on your head.

2594
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:34,910
Yeah.

2595
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:37,250
But Martine's is high
level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

2596
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:38,900
Black belt could kick boxer.

2597
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,660
He was holding his own with
cowboy mean he was getting,

2598
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,860
he was hanging in there
until he got head kicks.

2599
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,560
Cowboy was setting him up,

2600
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,660
but he was doing well up to that moment.

2601
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:48,650
He's a good fighter.

2602
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:50,400
Cowboy.

2603
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,201
She's so fast.

2604
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:54,560
Those head kicks and he's not
afraid to fight off his back.

2605
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:56,060
So he's not scared throwing that,

2606
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:56,520
you know,

2607
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,770
he's not worried about anything.

2608
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,790
Having a good guard.

2609
01:10:58,791 --> 01:10:59,020
Eddie.

2610
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:04,020
Oh he said this so huge for
kickboxers cowboys fighting a Colby.

2611
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,500
That's what we're talking about there.

2612
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:07,210
I haven't had a,

2613
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,043
I got,

2614
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,490
I wish you good guard with
that motherfucker have one.

2615
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:10,941
Yeah.

2616
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:11,930
That's a weird fight.

2617
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:13,650
That's a real weird fight.

2618
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,160
Tough

2619
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,993
fight.

2620
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,190
Tough.

2621
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:16,030
If there's anybody.

2622
01:11:16,031 --> 01:11:16,350
Yeah,

2623
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:16,621
for,

2624
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:17,580
well for both of them.

2625
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,480
But if there's any time to fight Khabib,

2626
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,740
it's now off this long way off
long layoff and knee surgery.

2627
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:23,251
Who knows?

2628
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:24,750
Like where his knees really at.

2629
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:25,440
Great.

2630
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,251
Take down.

2631
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:26,460
Right?

2632
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,293
Nine is Bam.

2633
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,560
He gets that and that.

2634
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:29,190
Sure.

2635
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,023
Nope,

2636
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,400
this reus Tom on his back.

2637
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,140
Interesting to see how big it gets.

2638
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:34,381
Hard.

2639
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:35,214
Look,

2640
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,870
how's that car loan wall crawl?

2641
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,543
Damn.

2642
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,493
He doesn't like that.

2643
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:41,010
You're allowed to grab the fence.

2644
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,450
Getting him off the fence,

2645
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,370
which you might as well because
all they do is warn you.

2646
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,200
Pushing him away from the fence.

2647
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,891
That's awesome.

2648
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:47,280
Right?

2649
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,600
It's great control on that leg.

2650
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:50,400
So interesting.

2651
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:53,420
Coming up does not want this guy on there.

2652
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:53,731
Get Him.

2653
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:54,564
Get up.

2654
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:57,270
Oh Man.

2655
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:57,750
Not Today.

2656
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,583
My friend day.

2657
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:00,783
No

2658
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:01,110
land.

2659
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:01,760
That's his gig.

2660
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,401
That's right there.

2661
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,510
He's got good jets.

2662
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,380
Ooh.

2663
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,350
See all that grease seal.

2664
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:06,630
They just slipped so easy.

2665
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:08,390
Yeah.

2666
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,590
His thing was the suplex and then guys
get aware of it and once you get to a

2667
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:13,424
certain level,

2668
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:18,200
well he's kind of taken one out now that
someone took him down and engaged him

2669
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:19,034
in grappling.

2670
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:19,730
Right?

2671
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,120
True.

2672
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,780
That's a high level take down.

2673
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:22,910
That looked like a college wrestler.

2674
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:23,610
Take that.

2675
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:24,290
Great.

2676
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:25,220
That's his world.

2677
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:28,010
I mean that's hobby labs world and all
of sudden he's on his back for the first

2678
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:28,181
time.

2679
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:28,971
His UFC career.

2680
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:30,680
He's been trying to stand up more lately.

2681
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,450
He did great shots.

2682
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:33,140
This black.

2683
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:33,680
Oh,

2684
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,690
that's why I don't top and
couldn't do any of that too.

2685
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:36,950
That's a nice right hand.

2686
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:38,241
He's through that.

2687
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:41,120
Like that's like a semi chocolate
Dell style over here and right.

2688
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,343
Okay.

2689
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:43,521
Yeah.

2690
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:45,170
I mean Martine's didn't
really threaten him at all.

2691
01:12:45,171 --> 01:12:46,004
Right.

2692
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:49,360
No Brazilians have great skin there.

2693
01:12:49,361 --> 01:12:50,470
I said it beautiful.

2694
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:51,310
Yeah.

2695
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,030
Kara mouse,

2696
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:52,750
like a Mocha,

2697
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,583
the caramel.

2698
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:55,730
I'm not mad at it.

2699
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:56,350
Nah,

2700
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,071
no reason to be.

2701
01:12:57,071 --> 01:12:57,491
You know what I mean?

2702
01:12:57,491 --> 01:12:57,850
Brennan?

2703
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:58,031
Yeah,

2704
01:12:58,031 --> 01:12:58,301
I feel,

2705
01:12:58,301 --> 01:12:58,690
yeah,

2706
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,051
it's tough.

2707
01:12:59,051 --> 01:12:59,980
You have had of that kind of skin.

2708
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:00,880
Don't sell yourself short.

2709
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:01,510
So does headache.

2710
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,781
Nah,

2711
01:13:01,781 --> 01:13:02,261
not really.

2712
01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:05,140
I said both of you listen
to Yellowstone blows.

2713
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,750
We might all be living
in Brazil in five years.

2714
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:09,470
Yeah.

2715
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,790
Yellowstone explodes and half
the fucking country is dead.

2716
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:13,930
Is there a chance of that?

2717
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:14,510
Fuck yeah.

2718
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,343
Giant,

2719
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:16,323
giant one.

2720
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:17,823
Huge Jansen.

2721
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,733
No bullshit.

2722
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,430
So a continent killer really?

2723
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:21,911
Well,

2724
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:23,420
why the fuck isn't seen Antonio?

2725
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:23,910
This dude,

2726
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,400
it's,

2727
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,720
it's Whoa.

2728
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,090
Nice kicked right by Martine's.

2729
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,290
It's a,

2730
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:31,360
what they call a Caldera volcano,

2731
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:35,680
which is a volcano that's so violent
that it starts out as like a mountain.

2732
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:40,950
The mountain explodes and what you're
left with is a crater that they have to

2733
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:43,420
look at it from satellites
to even recognize what it is.

2734
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:46,590
They didn't even know it
was a volcano until Mike,

2735
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,600
the two thousands like when when they
started looking at the area with a

2736
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:52,870
satellite imagery,

2737
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:53,501
they started going,

2738
01:13:53,501 --> 01:13:53,801
wait,

2739
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:54,010
whoa,

2740
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:54,460
whoa,

2741
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:54,870
whoa,

2742
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:55,151
Whoa,

2743
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:55,361
whoa.

2744
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:56,740
What the fuck are we looking at here?

2745
01:13:57,190 --> 01:13:57,760
And then they went,

2746
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,930
Oh gee,

2747
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:00,040
oh no.

2748
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,510
I realize it's 600 kilometers wide.

2749
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,550
That's why there's nothing we can do.

2750
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,031
Oh,

2751
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:11,920
not only these isn't nothing that
goes off every six eight Yellowstone

2752
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,920
goes off every six to 800,000 years.

2753
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:15,910
When's the last time went off?

2754
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:18,940
600,000 so we got 200,000 we're good.

2755
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,751
If we're lucky,

2756
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:20,920
it could go off tomorrow.

2757
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:21,581
I mean,

2758
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:24,820
they've had thousands of earthquakes
every year for a long time.

2759
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,280
They have thousands of
earthquakes every year.

2760
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,870
I'll give you go to Yellowstone.

2761
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,440
Hmm?

2762
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,900
Almost every day you're going
to have a fucking earthquake.

2763
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,610
Sometimes multiple.

2764
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:33,971
Hey,

2765
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:34,840
he's here.

2766
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,791
John Wayne part.

2767
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:36,624
Ladies and gentlemen,

2768
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:38,343
have a seat.

2769
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,460
We're on the,

2770
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:40,300
on the air right now.

2771
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,383
What's up brother?

2772
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,090
You're Alpha brain gym.

2773
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,833
There's some over man.

2774
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,473
How you doing buddy?

2775
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,840
You scare me with that talk Joe.

2776
01:14:59,841 --> 01:15:00,541
You gotta be honest,

2777
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:00,871
my man.

2778
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:01,770
That's why I don't smoke weed.

2779
01:15:01,771 --> 01:15:04,080
Cause if I did I'd be running
for the hills right now.

2780
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:04,963
Packing Shit,

2781
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,120
beef.

2782
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:06,953
Afraid of,

2783
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,820
but there's nothing
anybody can do about it.

2784
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:10,500
You'd have to just get to another spot.

2785
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,570
You know there's hills.

2786
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,413
My only option.

2787
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,050
Well,

2788
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,580
Australia would be a good option.

2789
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:15,930
I'm not mad at John Wayne par.

2790
01:15:15,931 --> 01:15:16,950
Let you fucking know.

2791
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,470
Okay,

2792
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:17,900
that's,

2793
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,030
we might catch John.

2794
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,520
We might have to move to Australia.

2795
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:21,720
If the Yellowstone blows.

2796
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,890
Can we crash at your place?

2797
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,710
Just so friendly.

2798
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,070
Well,

2799
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,701
there's the plan.

2800
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:27,534
Plan B gentlemen.

2801
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:29,283
Um,

2802
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,640
this dude is a,

2803
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:32,523
your friend.

2804
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:33,931
Oh Hey Andy.

2805
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:34,470
What's up man?

2806
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:34,880
We got to get,

2807
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,300
get him a chair or something.

2808
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:36,521
Jamie,

2809
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:37,354
we've got a chair for him.

2810
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,373
So I'm sit down.

2811
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:39,481
Well,

2812
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:40,740
we're watching Bruce Dom,

2813
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:43,980
hobby lav and a Adriana
Martine's first round.

2814
01:15:43,981 --> 01:15:45,600
Very good round for Martine's.

2815
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,010
Latinas won that round.

2816
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,810
John Wayne par multiple time Moy Thai
world champion in the motherfucking house.

2817
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:52,530
Ah,

2818
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:53,610
this is amazing to be here.

2819
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:54,840
Good to have you brother.

2820
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,030
Flying over from another
part of the world.

2821
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,740
We're talking about places to escape.

2822
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,030
When Yellowstone,

2823
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,120
the super volcano explodes and
kills everybody in North America.

2824
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:03,980
So,

2825
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:04,120
uh,

2826
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,700
Australia is a strong possibility.

2827
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,920
I feel like you just broke news on that.

2828
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:08,540
No,

2829
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,373
everybody knows.

2830
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,060
You guys all knew.

2831
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:10,893
You knew this.

2832
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,030
You knew only through Joe,

2833
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:12,864
only through Joe,

2834
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:13,980
but it's one of the things that,

2835
01:16:13,981 --> 01:16:14,280
you know,

2836
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,300
if it does blow,

2837
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,050
don't worry,

2838
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,370
you're dying and it's fine.

2839
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:17,911
Well,

2840
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:22,280
you might die slow if you're anywhere
like outside of the perimeter of them die

2841
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,280
or it's not that bad.

2842
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,330
The for everything a hundred
miles around it is dead instantly.

2843
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:28,230
What about,

2844
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:28,860
well,

2845
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,000
Yellowstone here,

2846
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,620
it went fully live on the beach.

2847
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:32,873
You're going to be

2848
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,690
people jumping in the ocean,

2849
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:37,950
so you're dying by lava.

2850
01:16:37,951 --> 01:16:38,341
Don't worry.

2851
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:39,890
It's just I live in stone.

2852
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:40,170
Yeah,

2853
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:40,661
but it's the,

2854
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:40,860
uh,

2855
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:43,760
the heat and the Google plus is one
the gun and go right there at the,

2856
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,520
you're the last one and you
can get on your boogie board.

2857
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,453
And

2858
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,990
what would probably happen is that the
son would get completely blotted out.

2859
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:53,833
That's what,

2860
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,331
that's what's up.

2861
01:16:54,331 --> 01:16:55,170
No more vegetables.

2862
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,700
No more vicious animals would die.

2863
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:58,410
Rotten meat everywhere.

2864
01:16:58,411 --> 01:16:59,131
Candy or food.

2865
01:16:59,131 --> 01:17:00,280
You fought diseases.

2866
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:00,631
Say this,

2867
01:17:00,631 --> 01:17:02,370
you guys are fucked in Calabasas.

2868
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,603
Wow.

2869
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:04,830
Everybody's fucked.

2870
01:17:04,831 --> 01:17:08,550
Everybody beach through
their fucked your Fox.

2871
01:17:08,551 --> 01:17:09,320
First of all,

2872
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:09,801
guess what?

2873
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:10,010
Fuck

2874
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,281
face.

2875
01:17:10,281 --> 01:17:13,310
The beach ain't even going to be
there because you had a super volcano.

2876
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:15,020
You're dealing with massive earthquakes.

2877
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,700
Tsunamis without a doubt.

2878
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:17,623
Know

2879
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,650
you'll catch a wave all the way
to Japan except Jesus Christ.

2880
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,550
Remember escape from La.

2881
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,470
Yes,

2882
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:29,930
Russell.

2883
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:30,141
Dude,

2884
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:31,490
he was on a wave,

2885
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,583
so ridiculous.

2886
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:35,570
It was like I'm green screen and
he's serving on green screen,

2887
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,650
so we're just all screwed.

2888
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:37,220
What you're saying,

2889
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,680
just exalt Jesus Christ as
your savior and you'll be fine.

2890
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,780
It's one of those things
where when it does blow,

2891
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:42,614
it's going to kill him.

2892
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,260
A major chunk of the
population of the world,

2893
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,760
not just the United States,

2894
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:47,720
but of the world.

2895
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:52,220
There's a one that happened in Indonesia
that 70,000 years ago and they think

2896
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:56,660
it's one of the main reasons why there's
like when you teach trace the genetic

2897
01:17:56,661 --> 01:17:57,200
lineage.

2898
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,451
Dan,

2899
01:17:57,451 --> 01:17:59,150
it was a good fucking
fight at his hobby lobby.

2900
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:00,350
Just cracked him with a left hook.

2901
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,580
I can take a shot,

2902
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:02,120
man.

2903
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:02,953
Yeah.

2904
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,560
Um,

2905
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,030
they think there's one of the,

2906
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:05,930
one of the Thi Oh,

2907
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,720
[inaudible] Pepin elbow hobby lobby.

2908
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,030
Oh,

2909
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,340
he shot does a nasty body shot.

2910
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:15,950
They take that dude.

2911
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:19,040
He's throwing fucking heat upper cuts,

2912
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:20,000
mixing his punches.

2913
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:21,530
I call that mixing your punches up.

2914
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,110
Tell John Wayne Bar.

2915
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,740
It's called mixing your punches.

2916
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:30,320
That John Watch the angle,

2917
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,380
the corner is anything
he's saying makes sense.

2918
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:36,500
Does that make sense at all you
have to do is draw a diagram.

2919
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,080
I will take my workshop,

2920
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:38,480
Bro.

2921
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,330
I don't have room for you
this weekend and next weekend.

2922
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:42,440
There's a lot of hands on touching,

2923
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,990
not a spiritual and emotional work.

2924
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,853
Oh,

2925
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,910
we have a good cry and hold each other's

2926
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:52,243
hands on.

2927
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:53,690
We do.

2928
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:54,800
We do not wear pants.

2929
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:55,580
We have a strict page.

2930
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:56,600
No pants policy.

2931
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,440
It's like Nike but soda.

2932
01:18:59,670 --> 01:18:59,900
Well,

2933
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,250
the first class is called [inaudible].

2934
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:03,120
It's like Nokia first class.

2935
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,490
It's called I fuck guys.

2936
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:04,921
Okay.

2937
01:19:04,921 --> 01:19:08,300
Apparently there's 10 super
volcanoes that can destroy the world.

2938
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,860
10 Jesus Christ is the one in Japan.

2939
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:14,030
There's one in Columbia,

2940
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,380
the conspiracy theorists,

2941
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,930
a geologist.

2942
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,773
Right

2943
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:19,740
blow.

2944
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:20,481
Fuck man.

2945
01:19:20,481 --> 01:19:21,590
You get him to go to Mexico.

2946
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:22,880
They have one in Mexico.

2947
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:24,380
Most scientists are saying,

2948
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:24,861
come on,

2949
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:25,420
shut the fuck.

2950
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,253
Yeah,

2951
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,460
he's still got a couple
of million years down.

2952
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:31,070
Happens Mount Vesuvius.

2953
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:31,251
Well,

2954
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:31,631
it's kid.

2955
01:19:31,631 --> 01:19:33,230
They've killed a fuck load of people.

2956
01:19:33,231 --> 01:19:34,760
The Alex Jones of volcanoes.

2957
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:35,594
Can you imagine?

2958
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,880
What about Alex Jones got into volcanoes?

2959
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,710
Forget the economy.

2960
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,360
It's not about the economy anymore.

2961
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:42,251
I'm going,

2962
01:19:42,251 --> 01:19:47,251
I feel like the chances of it ending
America of volcano is pretty low.

2963
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:48,530
Well,

2964
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:51,710
it's only pretty low because
our lifetimes are very short.

2965
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:52,170
Yeah.

2966
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,390
You haven't seen Dante speak.

2967
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,180
It's,

2968
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,410
it's chances of ending America hold.

2969
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:01,590
It's chances of ending America are 100%
it's 100% over the course of the entire,

2970
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:06,020
over the course of the next
200 plus thousand years,

2971
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:07,740
it's 100% that makes sense.

2972
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:08,130
So it's

2973
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,500
not whether or not it's
going to end America.

2974
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:11,790
It's fucking going on in America.

2975
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:15,000
It's just whether or not you're going
to be alive to see it happen 100% or

2976
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:17,580
whether or not there'll
be society at that point.

2977
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:21,900
And whether or not we've been hit by an
asteroid already all be on Mars by that

2978
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:22,530
could be,

2979
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,070
could be on,

2980
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,460
I never know why.

2981
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:26,610
Why do you choose Mars?

2982
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:27,351
Well,

2983
01:20:27,351 --> 01:20:29,660
it's the only one I hear that
we're exploring right now.

2984
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,040
So the one in Indonesia is the one
I think that they believe killed.

2985
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,600
So many fucking people did.

2986
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:39,180
That's why when they do
like a genetic lineage,

2987
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,080
when they test,

2988
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:44,760
you know people's genes and try to
find the unique origin of mankind,

2989
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:49,260
they believe it all comes back to this
one group of people that survived the

2990
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,210
Super Volcano that blew 70,000 years ago.

2991
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,930
So sleep tight there.

2992
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,350
Venice Abbot,

2993
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:55,711
Kinney,

2994
01:20:55,711 --> 01:20:56,544
fight club.

2995
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,080
What happened with South Africa
being the cradle of civilization?

2996
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,101
Well,

2997
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:03,750
that's where people started for sure,

2998
01:21:03,751 --> 01:21:04,350
but they move.

2999
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:05,940
Oh Damn.

3000
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,010
That was a beautiful left hook.

3001
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,300
We're talking so much shit.

3002
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:10,134
We miss that.

3003
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:10,771
Well,

3004
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:11,550
we're talking legit.

3005
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,361
We're trying to tell people,

3006
01:21:12,361 --> 01:21:13,780
get your shit together because it's not.

3007
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:14,730
Keto is about the bloating.

3008
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:16,471
I'm telling them,

3009
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,304
it doesn't matter.

3010
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,750
Even if you get your shit together,

3011
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:20,310
if you live in America and it happens,

3012
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,420
most people are dead.

3013
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,250
It's a continent

3014
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:22,670
killer.

3015
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,010
Mike,

3016
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:24,470
my father used to ruin everybody's Day.

3017
01:21:24,471 --> 01:21:26,120
We'd be opening presents at Christmas.

3018
01:21:26,121 --> 01:21:27,350
He looked up from his book and Go,

3019
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:28,970
and the 1930s,

3020
01:21:28,971 --> 01:21:32,000
13 million people died of
starvation in the Ukraine.

3021
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,903
Enjoy yourself.

3022
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:34,310
Go back to his book.

3023
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:34,671
I was like,

3024
01:21:34,671 --> 01:21:34,791
oh,

3025
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:35,421
fuck off.

3026
01:21:35,421 --> 01:21:36,254
Is that a real number?

3027
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,170
It would just make dot.

3028
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:38,323
Well,

3029
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:43,620
if you look at the greater area
of an before World War Two,

3030
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,120
when Stalin starved the Ukraine,

3031
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,920
the number is crazy high.

3032
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:50,323
Um,

3033
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,010
and I think overall,

3034
01:21:52,011 --> 01:21:54,380
if you consider Latvia and all
those areas of Baltic states,

3035
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,610
it's about 13 mil.

3036
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:57,003
John Wayne Park,

3037
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:57,730
when you,

3038
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:58,960
I'm sorry to change subjects here,

3039
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:02,770
but when you're watching MMA and
you're watching like striking,

3040
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:03,670
you know,

3041
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:05,440
we were talking about this
earlier with Eddie Bravo,

3042
01:22:05,441 --> 01:22:07,030
we're talking about Jujitsu positions.

3043
01:22:07,031 --> 01:22:07,241
Like,

3044
01:22:07,241 --> 01:22:08,060
do you see these,

3045
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,000
these positions that
people don't capitalize on?

3046
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:14,020
Like what level do you think
like MMA striking is at now?

3047
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:14,710
It's not,

3048
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:17,680
it's obviously not the level
of the highest level Moy Tai,

3049
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:18,361
but like what,

3050
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:20,140
what do you think about MMA striking?

3051
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:20,411
Oh,

3052
01:22:20,411 --> 01:22:21,160
I think it's amazing.

3053
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:21,640
Uh,

3054
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,510
some of the guys that,

3055
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:23,460
Luxor,

3056
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:23,770
Ronnie,

3057
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,420
I left [inaudible] he said he's so good.

3058
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:26,640
Uh,

3059
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,580
and then yeah,

3060
01:22:27,581 --> 01:22:30,140
it's just different because
you guys can't stand and trade.

3061
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,950
They can't go to toe to toe and he
kind of just keep letting the bombs go.

3062
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:33,970
Otherwise you get taken down.

3063
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:34,470
Right.

3064
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:35,020
So,

3065
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,460
but I respect these guys so much.

3066
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:36,731
No,

3067
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:37,564
of course you do.

3068
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:38,330
Of course.

3069
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:41,470
He wanted to compete in MMA.

3070
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,220
I did.

3071
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,800
And then I broke my finger and
then that's why I came up with my,

3072
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:48,820
a new promotion with the Cajun Way
Tinier because a Jaeger finger grappling,

3073
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:48,971
I,

3074
01:22:48,971 --> 01:22:49,300
Yay.

3075
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,660
I did my very first class and
I broke my finger 120 more.

3076
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:53,623
It's not a,

3077
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:55,600
I do wonder gt class and burnt my finger.

3078
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,790
So it's like how can I put
in the cage but not dude,

3079
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:01,630
you did to cause I don't want
to break any more fingers.

3080
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,280
And then now that's hilarious.

3081
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:03,851
That's when I thought,

3082
01:23:03,851 --> 01:23:06,070
well stuff it I'll do an
occasional times they'd

3083
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,323
hmm.

3084
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,520
And you've never wanted to go back to MMA?

3085
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,630
Well now I've got my,

3086
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,583
um,

3087
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,350
that desire to fight in the cage.

3088
01:23:13,351 --> 01:23:14,260
True what I'm doing now.

3089
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,770
And then I'm not going to be good at it
too because I'm not doing bad at more

3090
01:23:16,771 --> 01:23:17,170
Thai.

3091
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:20,080
What's that difference between fighting
in the cage and fighting your ring?

3092
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:21,520
If you could just going
to keep it on your feet.

3093
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,330
Ah,

3094
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,460
I've also incorporated
the MMA gloves as well.

3095
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:25,270
Look at this.

3096
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:25,781
So yeah,

3097
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:26,050
it's,

3098
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:26,711
it's everything.

3099
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,330
It's everything MMA.

3100
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,820
So as soon as you go to the ground,

3101
01:23:30,821 --> 01:23:32,650
you'll stop and stand back up and
then you start banging it again.

3102
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,930
She got down in the Clinton,

3103
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,870
thrown in there like a,

3104
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,731
you can in the moist.

3105
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:39,131
Why clinch,

3106
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:40,360
but you can't sort of suplex.

3107
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,673
Okay.

3108
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:42,970
And there's a cancer as well,

3109
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,481
so we let it,

3110
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:43,811
I can't.

3111
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:44,940
So if you get knocked down,

3112
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,750
there's still a chance you can
still come back and still win.

3113
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:48,041
So yeah.

3114
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:49,060
But it's very violent.

3115
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:49,281
Oh,

3116
01:23:49,281 --> 01:23:50,230
I looked it up on youtube.

3117
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:52,720
The guys are fighting in the cage
with boxing gloves on and looked very

3118
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:53,231
peculiar.

3119
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:53,621
So I thought,

3120
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:54,454
you know what,

3121
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:56,860
I have to be in such a big
fan of the UFC for so long.

3122
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,200
I couldn't put big gloves on.

3123
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,070
I have to do it properly.

3124
01:24:00,071 --> 01:24:03,660
So what would you think about guys
fighting bare knuckle and MMA?

3125
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:05,110
Do you think that makes any sense at all?

3126
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:05,750
Yeah,

3127
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,850
too dangerous hands.

3128
01:24:06,851 --> 01:24:08,110
My hands is break your hands.

3129
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,010
My hands are screwed.

3130
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:09,300
Right.

3131
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,380
But for like for realism,

3132
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:12,221
you know,

3133
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:15,730
because a lot of the reasons why people
were able to just on low with a bunch of

3134
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:17,200
punches is because they have gloves on.

3135
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:17,530
Right,

3136
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:17,980
true.

3137
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:18,410
True.

3138
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:19,243
Um,

3139
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:19,541
yeah,

3140
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:20,010
the damage.

3141
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:22,000
But to be sustained and
to try and get insured,

3142
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:26,080
would it be quite difficult because
the hands and the hand doctor on staff?

3143
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:26,411
Yeah.

3144
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:28,630
And just in case of somebody dying too,

3145
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,220
you wouldn't want to see someone dying.

3146
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:30,760
Then your promotion,

3147
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,050
especially if you're the promoter,

3148
01:24:32,051 --> 01:24:34,960
had he put your head on the pillow at
night time knowing that someone's died on

3149
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:35,794
your show,

3150
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,580
when you think that would make
people die more often with no gloves,

3151
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:42,270
I would think that would
cause more decrement.

3152
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:45,430
The grand and Pam would with no
gloves on them could be quite severe.

3153
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:46,240
Hmm.

3154
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:46,961
I wonder man,

3155
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:51,080
cause I feel like you can
shin kick someone in the
head with no pads on and need

3156
01:24:51,081 --> 01:24:53,820
someone in the head with no
pads on elbows with no pads.

3157
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
They mentioned it true.

3158
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:56,860
I just don't think that it would.

3159
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,630
I think I track,

3160
01:24:58,690 --> 01:24:59,930
I retract my last segment.

3161
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:02,750
[inaudible]

3162
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:06,520
no glove on your Shin right
to the face and that's okay.

3163
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,320
I've seen you can't do it with your fist.

3164
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,430
I've seen you kicked dudes.

3165
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:11,380
I've seen you kicked dude's you kick.

3166
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:13,300
I mean it's just ridiculous.

3167
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:16,540
The idea that anybody can punch as
hard as you can care is ridiculous.

3168
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:20,140
There's not a man alive that punches as
hard as you kick that they don't exist

3169
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,760
yet and you're crying,

3170
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,140
you're bouncing chins off dudes,

3171
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:23,650
heads,

3172
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:24,740
blacks.

3173
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:25,481
I mean,

3174
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:26,314
come on.

3175
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:31,780
The problem with being
just getting it sanctioned,

3176
01:25:31,781 --> 01:25:32,041
right?

3177
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:34,500
Cause UFC is just now
getting out of like if,

3178
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,460
if you're,

3179
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,430
oh,

3180
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,090
see that fucking his Momma,

3181
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:40,540
the body Ray Leonard,

3182
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,230
you know.

3183
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:41,441
Yeah.

3184
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:42,400
It was a Bolo Punch.

3185
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:43,803
He brought it back,

3186
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:44,890
brought it.

3187
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:45,071
No,

3188
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:45,610
you're right.

3189
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:46,800
Brendan it with me and it's,

3190
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:47,411
it's really,

3191
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:47,590
uh,

3192
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:51,790
you know that guy who was fucking helping
keep a illegal in New York just got

3193
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:53,020
arrested for corruption.

3194
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:53,854
You know that right?

3195
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,110
[inaudible] name mentioned his name.

3196
01:25:57,111 --> 01:26:00,550
It's like Satan don't
match the old politicians,

3197
01:26:00,551 --> 01:26:01,720
those old crooked,

3198
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:04,220
grubby fucking disgusting

3199
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,130
little fucking carpet bagging.

3200
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,390
Concentrate Bush,

3201
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,350
those disgusting old men.

3202
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,310
Disgusting old men existing on envelopes.

3203
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,220
Yup.

3204
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,750
Fucking timeshares.

3205
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:16,260
He's out.

3206
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:17,094
He's out.

3207
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:18,701
Huge,

3208
01:26:18,701 --> 01:26:19,031
huge,

3209
01:26:19,031 --> 01:26:21,250
huge for the UFC that this guy's done.

3210
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,420
Imagine John Jones,

3211
01:26:22,421 --> 01:26:23,440
Madison Square Garden.

3212
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,131
God Damn,

3213
01:26:24,131 --> 01:26:24,281
dude,

3214
01:26:24,281 --> 01:26:26,980
that's not outside of the
wrong possibility at all.

3215
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:27,191
I mean,

3216
01:26:27,191 --> 01:26:28,360
we're going back there in April.

3217
01:26:28,361 --> 01:26:30,640
We got to go to New Jersey
with great for New Jersey.

3218
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,220
Good Jersey makes a shitload of money.

3219
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:34,270
It's just right there.

3220
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:34,540
He just,

3221
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:34,850
you know,

3222
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,890
cross the river.

3223
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,590
When I fought in New Jersey,

3224
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,470
we did all the press,

3225
01:26:38,471 --> 01:26:39,520
everything in New York,

3226
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:40,870
New Jersey.

3227
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:41,320
Yeah,

3228
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:41,681
of course.

3229
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:41,921
I mean,

3230
01:26:41,921 --> 01:26:42,671
why would you not?

3231
01:26:42,671 --> 01:26:43,480
You're right next to the,

3232
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:47,800
one of the greatest media empires are one
of the greatest media locations in the

3233
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:50,050
world for the,

3234
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:50,800
you know,

3235
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,640
for the east coast.

3236
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,270
I think off I lost that fight.

3237
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:56,711
Who the fuck knows you?

3238
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:56,931
Barely.

3239
01:26:56,931 --> 01:26:57,010
Yeah.

3240
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:57,730
Van Attention.

3241
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:57,851
Oh,

3242
01:26:57,851 --> 01:26:59,500
I was watching how he's lost the fight.

3243
01:26:59,501 --> 01:27:00,050
For sure.

3244
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:00,410
You're,

3245
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:01,160
you're correct.

3246
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:01,640
Yeah.

3247
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,980
Was we did get mounted.

3248
01:27:02,981 --> 01:27:03,120
That's,

3249
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,310
yeah,

3250
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:03,790
sure.

3251
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:04,660
He's been taken down.

3252
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:07,280
That was amazing.

3253
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,970
Martine's was a mounting him right.

3254
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,150
He's taking them down.

3255
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:11,660
Yeah.

3256
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:11,891
That's,

3257
01:27:11,891 --> 01:27:12,800
say Tom was beautiful though.

3258
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:12,981
Yeah.

3259
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:13,150
Well,

3260
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:15,110
one of the first John Wayne,

3261
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:15,951
do you have to,

3262
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:16,784
um,

3263
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:19,550
do you have to constantly keep your shins,

3264
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:19,880
uh,

3265
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,330
uh,

3266
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:21,170
num oil?

3267
01:27:21,171 --> 01:27:21,471
Do they,

3268
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:21,981
once they,

3269
01:27:21,981 --> 01:27:22,461
once they,

3270
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:23,420
once you kill the nerves,

3271
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:24,254
they just never come back.

3272
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:25,850
I've been there.

3273
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:26,820
There's a old wives,

3274
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,291
totally waste.

3275
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:30,420
Basically hit your shins
with the the every day.

3276
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:30,990
Keep calling.

3277
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,750
He's a coke bottle from Mexico.

3278
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:37,620
I'm failing just kicking the heavy
bag and lots of fights and you slowly,

3279
01:27:37,621 --> 01:27:40,900
you Shane guys flat and
hot and condense then yeah,

3280
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,110
no dramas anymore.

3281
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:43,370
Can I touch your Shin there?

3282
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:44,204
Is that what I show?

3283
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,040
[inaudible]

3284
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,220
that's a big shift.

3285
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:53,750
We know what they say that it's like you
get these little micro fractures like

3286
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:57,890
tiny little microfractures all over the
outside and those microfractures you get

3287
01:27:57,891 --> 01:28:01,100
a little blood in it and that blood
calcifies then the whole thing almost

3288
01:28:01,101 --> 01:28:02,300
becomes like a Shin Pad.

3289
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:06,620
Like you ever see that video of lion
fights where Malik pet was fighting this

3290
01:28:06,621 --> 01:28:08,660
guy and just started going
Shinny Shin with them.

3291
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,850
Just smash the guy.

3292
01:28:10,851 --> 01:28:12,740
They'd shouldn't he Shinta check to kick.

3293
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:15,830
The Guy did mal pet through kicked the
Guy Shin checked it and the guy started

3294
01:28:15,831 --> 01:28:19,490
limping and so malpedas
smiles at him and goes charge.

3295
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:21,350
I'm just go Shin Shin with
them over and over again.

3296
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:24,830
Smash smashing his shin like
he didn't feel it at all.

3297
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:25,190
Oh,

3298
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:29,870
it's like he's wearing this giant armor
plated shiniest and he's got those giant

3299
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:30,740
fucking calves.

3300
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:31,041
Anyway,

3301
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:33,340
those tie calves and giant shinbones,

3302
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,870
those Kellen calves,

3303
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:37,040
calves gets the opposite.

3304
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,440
Put that away when I'm out of that.

3305
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:45,860
When guys are starting
at the very pointed Sean,

3306
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,930
John and then um,

3307
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:48,420
yeah.

3308
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,300
Then the more you train and then slowly,

3309
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,290
slowly I think I more,

3310
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,710
more flat and then um,

3311
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:53,630
where's your school?

3312
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,110
Honestly does the potential

3313
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:02,980
like a honest assessment check
his hamstrings down the Hey Brian,

3314
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:06,150
tell John about your taekwondo days.

3315
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:06,301
Dot.

3316
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:06,530
Okay.

3317
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:07,363
Good.

3318
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,840
Chai is we'll cake.

3319
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:14,520
Well he had these forms that would scare
us all my practice to have before the

3320
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:15,180
competition.

3321
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,013
Push my agenda,

3322
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,220
my balls into my body wouldn't,

3323
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,680
it was all Dick we remember that were
guys who would say they could do that.

3324
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:24,240
They would take ball kicks.

3325
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:25,951
Well there's still,

3326
01:29:25,951 --> 01:29:29,550
there's like videos out there of guys
taking ball kicks and it's like scientific

3327
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:32,280
attempts to analyze like how
they're able to take ball kicks.

3328
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,080
Well they did the one on fight science

3329
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,130
guys.

3330
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:38,050
He's telling the story
screen or something.

3331
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:39,161
I think Morrie's created,

3332
01:29:39,161 --> 01:29:40,770
someone just gave them like a full kick.

3333
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:41,700
I don't know it was,

3334
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:46,680
but it's all and apparently it's the
exact same thing where your balls become

3335
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,660
like stones,

3336
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:50,810
like basically front of your mind.

3337
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,680
What kind of kids do you make with balls
that had been kicked off in practice

3338
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:56,514
repeatedly?

3339
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:58,470
I heard a rumor.

3340
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,820
It's the equivalent of a woman giving
birth is when a man gets kicked in the

3341
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:03,250
balls.

3342
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:04,260
That's now don't kill me,

3343
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:07,100
but that's what I heard
for that quick instant.

3344
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,910
It's a different kind of
bank has been in the balls.

3345
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:11,300
You get like a sick sick.

3346
01:30:11,301 --> 01:30:12,520
It's not just pain.

3347
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,470
You got kicked in the stomach,

3348
01:30:16,471 --> 01:30:16,800
you got,

3349
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,030
you got kicked in the liver.

3350
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,250
It's that more than pain.

3351
01:30:20,251 --> 01:30:21,270
It sounds emotional.

3352
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,480
Have you seen a woman giving birth?

3353
01:30:22,481 --> 01:30:22,890
Because I've been,

3354
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:27,180
I've been up close and personal pussy
tears apart like a moose that got caught

3355
01:30:27,181 --> 01:30:28,110
in a meat grinder.

3356
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,993
Machine

3357
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:32,063
joke.

3358
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,160
Babies' heads are giant.

3359
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:36,570
Vaginas are small.

3360
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,200
Yup.

3361
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:37,710
Just say,

3362
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:37,950
hey.

3363
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,040
I did start to worry about,

3364
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:40,530
well I met a guy told me,

3365
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:44,650
it's like I have a friend of a gay
cousin Oscar the grouch with Ted.

3366
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:47,970
Still the greatest line anybody ever say.

3367
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,270
She's boxy dude.

3368
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,130
She's boxy.

3369
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,470
He's saying he called her Oscar,

3370
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:59,340
she said between his girl and his girl
makes her look like Oscar the grouch with

3371
01:30:59,341 --> 01:31:00,174
tits.

3372
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,830
I couldn't stop laughing.

3373
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:02,610
How's laugh?

3374
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:05,430
I yelled it out at myself
as I was driving home.

3375
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:07,110
Oscar the grouch with Ted's.

3376
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,220
Ah,

3377
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:11,230
like two days later I'm text message.

3378
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,260
Something that Joey Diaz would say.

3379
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:20,130
How would he say fuck the box
Oscar and grouch with tits.

3380
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:21,780
Yeah,

3381
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:25,380
but when does Liam Neeson old
enough to be kicking people's asses?

3382
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:28,470
65 now he's over and over.

3383
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:29,363
I like that.

3384
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:33,360
Keep showing old dudes doing great
shit cause we're all going to be old.

3385
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:34,194
It's actually,

3386
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,450
let me see that it's going to benefit you.

3387
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:37,360
You're young and beautiful.

3388
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,221
Oh my God,

3389
01:31:40,221 --> 01:31:41,640
you're the primary Goddamn life.

3390
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,210
I know.

3391
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:43,043
Tear shit up.

3392
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,833
Tearing Shit.

3393
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,420
He just talking shit.

3394
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:52,823
Looks Young.

3395
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,780
How much longer you think
you got to keep competing?

3396
01:31:54,781 --> 01:31:55,614
Man,

3397
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:58,530
I've got a couple more this year
and then we'll play it by ear.

3398
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,070
The small

3399
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,903
glove cage.

3400
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:02,800
What are you doing?

3401
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,790
That's amazing man.

3402
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:04,710
What are you doing with that?

3403
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:05,590
I'd watch.

3404
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:06,730
What is that shirt you're wearing?

3405
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:08,070
That's a friend of mine and he's a,

3406
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:09,190
he's plugging it in.

3407
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,000
Uh,

3408
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,833
Australia.

3409
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,430
Can you,

3410
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:14,500
can you get in the clinch
as long as you want a knee.

3411
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,130
Can you do that?

3412
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:15,350
Yup.

3413
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:16,020
Yup.

3414
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:16,870
Let's break it up.

3415
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:17,860
Ever when they clench,

3416
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,753
when it's done,

3417
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,310
it's getting stale and
they look us as active.

3418
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,920
But they'll let you work in the clinch.

3419
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:23,200
Yes.

3420
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,930
That's a beautiful thing because I think
k one you can't work on the collection

3421
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,380
side,

3422
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:26,640
right?

3423
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,160
That's where they can find Gloria.

3424
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,060
They give him like five seconds.

3425
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,540
Why are they doing that?

3426
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,140
Doesn't it seem like it sort of water
the damn boy toy and they try it.

3427
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:38,710
They're trying to make it entertaining
for the fans because getting in clinch

3428
01:32:38,711 --> 01:32:40,090
fighting is not as boring.

3429
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:43,480
I guess the guys who are in
the k one is change the rules.

3430
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:46,510
But since more cow came the Kois
and he started dominating people.

3431
01:32:46,511 --> 01:32:49,450
So the thing and now how can we make it
even for the western as a vista toys.

3432
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:53,540
I know we'll make it like the three
second rule war when he rule well it

3433
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:55,450
incorporates a lot of grappling.

3434
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:59,140
You know it's obviously doesn't have
any submissions and it doesn't have any,

3435
01:32:59,141 --> 01:33:01,780
you know any like take downs
the way a wrestler has.

3436
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,060
But that grappling position,

3437
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:08,200
withholding that plum clinch and the
way those guys develop that squeeze the

3438
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:08,590
able to,

3439
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,300
the ability to move a guy around.

3440
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:11,240
It's much like,

3441
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:14,500
you know like a guy who's like a
really good next squeezer has that.

3442
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:15,460
Just certain something.

3443
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:18,160
Yeah guys get that with
that Thai clinch man.

3444
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:20,620
You remember when Anderson Silva
locked up with rich Franklin?

3445
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,890
Rich Franklin had never seen that before
and then know what to do about it.

3446
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:29,190
And Anderson was just so strong
that position and he's compared to,

3447
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,540
you know like the great ty,

3448
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:32,380
he's like a bull cow.

3449
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:33,191
Like come on man,

3450
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:33,481
he's not,

3451
01:33:33,481 --> 01:33:34,720
you're not even close.

3452
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:36,910
Know is not,

3453
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:38,200
is not even close.

3454
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:39,370
Not even close.

3455
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:39,940
Wow.

3456
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,010
You want to deal with like the,

3457
01:33:41,011 --> 01:33:44,470
the greatest tie fighters
and their technique and the
way they move and the way

3458
01:33:44,471 --> 01:33:46,570
that it can hold and not even close,

3459
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:47,110
man.

3460
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:48,110
You don't think so without,

3461
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:48,790
oh,

3462
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:49,930
without being disrespectful.

3463
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:50,670
Like the claims that,

3464
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:50,920
hey,

3465
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,660
I didn't mean that was a very amateur.

3466
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:53,900
That was a very basic clinch.

3467
01:33:53,901 --> 01:33:54,580
Barry just,

3468
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:55,151
there was no,

3469
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:55,850
there was no counter.

3470
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:57,730
All they do was hold his
hands down and just played,

3471
01:33:57,731 --> 01:33:58,450
not the die.

3472
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:59,530
And he laughed at it.

3473
01:33:59,730 --> 01:33:59,980
Yeah,

3474
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,813
pretty much.

3475
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:02,051
Yeah.

3476
01:34:02,051 --> 01:34:02,830
There's so many.

3477
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:03,441
I mean it's,

3478
01:34:03,441 --> 01:34:03,700
it's,

3479
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:07,210
it's hard for people who've
never seen a like really great,

3480
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:08,044
more tighter,

3481
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,610
more Thai fights.

3482
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:10,030
John,

3483
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:10,301
John,

3484
01:34:10,301 --> 01:34:11,770
how many fights have you been in total?

3485
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,900
122 damn.

3486
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,740
And then I had a 13 print books in four.

3487
01:34:15,741 --> 01:34:16,380
It's awesome.

3488
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,340
Oh Shit.

3489
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:20,420
But I had a throat,

3490
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,640
a few composer as well.

3491
01:34:21,641 --> 01:34:22,474
I'm going to show you

3492
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,430
what's the latest with Jeff Fenech Jeff.

3493
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:28,000
Oh,

3494
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,530
he's just doing his thing in Sydney.

3495
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:29,771
He's,

3496
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:32,960
I'm just doing promotions now
and he promotes fights now.

3497
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:33,791
Oh,

3498
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:35,140
he's been fighting for years.

3499
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:35,561
Oh.

3500
01:34:35,561 --> 01:34:36,394
So He's,

3501
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:39,880
he transitioned beautifully
out of boxing into promoting.

3502
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:40,091
Yeah.

3503
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,820
He's not in hunting as much as
about three or four years ago.

3504
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:45,370
He's chose run the POCs but
in pretty much every week.

3505
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:45,970
So He's,

3506
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:46,720
he was very busy.

3507
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,170
Yeah.

3508
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:48,340
What about Troy waters?

3509
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:48,680
Troy?

3510
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,080
What?

3511
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,630
I haven't had that name for you
cause I gotta Fuck Terry Mars.

3512
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,770
I used to be really into boxing.

3513
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,420
I was a fanatic until the UFC ruined.

3514
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:00,770
I'm looking forward to like have somebody
who's been finding his whole life like

3515
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:00,891
that.

3516
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:02,450
Are you looking forward to retirement?

3517
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:05,360
You're not dreading the
day gotta be a hard,

3518
01:35:05,361 --> 01:35:06,194
hard transition.

3519
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:11,480
I tried to retire a few years ago and the
thought of it just drove me nuts and I

3520
01:35:11,481 --> 01:35:13,340
had to come back again because
it was just killing me,

3521
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,410
not being in front of the crowds and not,

3522
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:15,890
um,

3523
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:16,820
it was after parties.

3524
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:19,130
Why after party?

3525
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:20,090
That's what it's really about.

3526
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:24,350
Laying in bed and not having
that and she's a patient of,

3527
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:25,430
of having a flight coming up.

3528
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,100
It was just the,

3529
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,650
I missed it so much
that it came back again.

3530
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:30,620
That's why guys who only have
that feeling should fight.

3531
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:31,580
Yeah,

3532
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:32,413
that's it.

3533
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,590
All these,

3534
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:35,780
all these guys like I'd
like to try one more time.

3535
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,400
Like shut the fuck up.

3536
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,010
You're going to run into
some goddamn John Wayne.

3537
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:40,880
Pour in the up.

3538
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:41,743
Who Sleeps?

3539
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:44,180
I like being afraid.

3540
01:35:44,181 --> 01:35:45,320
I like fighting the Goya is it?

3541
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:45,891
I'm scared of.

3542
01:35:45,891 --> 01:35:46,100
Oh,

3543
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,990
have you always been that
way since you can remember?

3544
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:48,800
Um,

3545
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,041
yeah,

3546
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:49,850
it was since I was,

3547
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:50,541
it seems like a walk.

3548
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:51,500
I've always wanted to be a fighter.

3549
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:52,463
Damn.

3550
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,333
Damn.

3551
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:56,060
It didn't matter if it
was Ninjitsu karate.

3552
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:59,180
I just wanted to fight
anything and then just happen.

3553
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:00,380
Kickboxing was near my house.

3554
01:36:00,381 --> 01:36:02,960
So that's how I started kickboxing in,

3555
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:04,063
in Australia.

3556
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:06,920
We're in Australia on
the Brisbane back then.

3557
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:07,970
But now I'm on the go cause,

3558
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:09,320
but I moved to Thailand when I was 19.

3559
01:36:09,321 --> 01:36:10,550
I lived in Thailand for five years.

3560
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:11,090
Wow.

3561
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,580
So lived in Bangkok and then had,

3562
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,500
I had about 50 fights in Thailand
and Ford and all the big stadiums.

3563
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,210
And when you speak Thai I do now.

3564
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:17,920
Wow.

3565
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,750
It's begun to jewelry.

3566
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:19,041
Get it.

3567
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:21,140
Like one of those Rosetta Stones Or,

3568
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:21,380
Huh?

3569
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,860
Cause I lived in toilet and I was,

3570
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,020
there was no imagine living in California
would know other people that could

3571
01:36:27,021 --> 01:36:27,770
speak English.

3572
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:28,390
That was,

3573
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:29,390
that was my lifestyle.

3574
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,070
So he just learned it
from talking to them.

3575
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:31,640
Yeah.

3576
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,010
I slept on the floor with 10 other people.

3577
01:36:34,011 --> 01:36:34,850
And then um,

3578
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:37,280
and then I want to speak English today
you'd have to do everything by hand

3579
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:37,941
signals first.

3580
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:39,170
But I had an aide or asleep.

3581
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:39,890
Oh Wow.

3582
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:43,760
And how different is Dutch kickboxing
from Moitai that you learned?

3583
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,950
More and more hands and more leg kicks.

3584
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,710
Whereas the ties and more body
kicks in and more knees and elbows.

3585
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:51,440
Why do you think that is a
different scoring system?

3586
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:55,640
The toys don't school punching
the dance school they kicks.

3587
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,473
They cause it's harder.

3588
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:57,270
It's harder to throw.

3589
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,190
Body kicked in is a leg kick.

3590
01:36:58,191 --> 01:37:02,450
Anyone can throw laky so that and
the toys in the clinching as well,

3591
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:02,841
the clinching,

3592
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:03,890
it would be good high score as well.

3593
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:06,330
Isn't that an interesting that
we don't think about that at all.

3594
01:37:06,331 --> 01:37:07,400
It was a scoring position.

3595
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:10,940
We think of the clenches of almost
being a stale stalemate position.

3596
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:15,650
How do you score who get whoever can
hold a plum clinch the longest live a

3597
01:37:15,651 --> 01:37:16,520
three's the last knee.

3598
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,240
Say if you've got two guys try and 50
knees and the evening and even the unit,

3599
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:22,090
the one who scores the
last needs score is that,

3600
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:22,490
that,

3601
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:23,323
that rally.

3602
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:24,140
Whoa.

3603
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:24,501
Yeah.

3604
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:26,180
So you see that you can
be there for 10 minutes,

3605
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:29,900
nee nee nee nee nee nee trying to break
each other and the referee goes stop.

3606
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:30,681
And that he's one.

3607
01:37:30,681 --> 01:37:31,310
That's it.

3608
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,143
Wow.

3609
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:33,860
But what if a guy knocks
a guy out with punches?

3610
01:37:33,861 --> 01:37:34,694
It says,

3611
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:38,780
if it's an lockout then then you're
winning boxes them up and the guy is still

3612
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:39,920
standing after three rounds,

3613
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:44,480
10 punches and one body keep the
body kick will win every time.

3614
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:45,890
That's crazy.

3615
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:49,880
Unless you Raymond Deca and then
be that there's a different story.

3616
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:50,930
So they're really,

3617
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:54,110
they're really must be into body kicks.

3618
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,350
Like to them,

3619
01:37:55,351 --> 01:37:56,310
that's the

3620
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,330
most important kick.

3621
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:57,541
Yeah.

3622
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:57,910
Your body.

3623
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:59,670
Can you go to Thailand?

3624
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:03,090
It's a completely different contrasts
of what you see here in America or in

3625
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:03,924
Australia.

3626
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:04,740
Um,

3627
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:07,800
but it's so beautiful to watch two or
what do you think about a guy like Simon?

3628
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:09,240
Marcus is a really famous,

3629
01:38:09,241 --> 01:38:09,570
uh,

3630
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:13,050
like really high level Muy Thai
fighter and then he fights for glory.

3631
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,670
They take away that clench,

3632
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:15,091
you know,

3633
01:38:15,091 --> 01:38:18,300
they take away like what percentage of
his game do you think gets eliminated

3634
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:19,230
when they take that away?

3635
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,780
You have to get back into
the gym and readjust as well.

3636
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:23,400
Cause I had the same as
me when I went to Kaitlin.

3637
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:23,780
Uh,

3638
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:25,380
always thought of doing okay.

3639
01:38:25,381 --> 01:38:25,700
But it was,

3640
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,730
I was losing it as well because I'd fight
the Thai style and then I'd lose the

3641
01:38:29,731 --> 01:38:31,380
guys that are punching
and it'd be like 30,

3642
01:38:31,381 --> 01:38:32,340
27 and it's quite,

3643
01:38:32,341 --> 01:38:32,760
hasn't hit me.

3644
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:33,120
Oh Man,

3645
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:33,953
I've kicked the shit out of him.

3646
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:34,530
Right.

3647
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:35,250
And then I was lost.

3648
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,660
What the hell man,

3649
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:37,411
Nathan Corbett,

3650
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:39,420
he also fought in glory.

3651
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:41,010
He fought Tyrone Spong and again,

3652
01:38:41,011 --> 01:38:42,760
they take away your clan should take away.

3653
01:38:42,761 --> 01:38:42,871
Yeah,

3654
01:38:42,871 --> 01:38:44,130
they'll be a lot of his weapons.

3655
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,670
He's main thing is the elbow,

3656
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,020
the elbow Kyla,

3657
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:49,110
he's handling 55.

3658
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:49,430
I know,

3659
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:50,350
probably 60 fights.

3660
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:55,320
50 50 or 45 knockouts and then 30th third
of them are by elbow and then all of a

3661
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:56,020
sudden they take us.

3662
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:56,361
I was like,

3663
01:38:56,361 --> 01:38:57,290
that's so crazy.

3664
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:58,183
Yeah.

3665
01:38:58,190 --> 01:38:58,710
This guy,

3666
01:38:58,710 --> 01:38:59,431
Nathan Corbett,

3667
01:38:59,431 --> 01:39:01,440
you never heard anything bad motherfucker,

3668
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:04,020
but he looked a little like a little,

3669
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:07,440
I mean not out of his element because
obviously he's fought that style before.

3670
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,860
But you know when you watch him with
the elbows and the clinch and everything

3671
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:11,160
and you,

3672
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,120
it was really comfortable.

3673
01:39:12,121 --> 01:39:12,481
It feels,

3674
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:17,300
but it feels odd seeing that that aspect
removed cause it's still standing up.

3675
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:18,121
It's still striking.

3676
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:19,470
Like why would they remove?

3677
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:20,940
That's like saying no opera cuts.

3678
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,780
Yeah.

3679
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:22,111
Sorry.

3680
01:39:22,111 --> 01:39:23,220
No body punches.

3681
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:24,230
You only punched a white guy.

3682
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,730
If there was no body punching,

3683
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:27,330
everybody would just come out like this.

3684
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,880
You know like everybody would
have like super high hands.

3685
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,260
Nobody would ever worry about their body.

3686
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:34,740
You'd have a totally different thing and
then you will let in body punching and

3687
01:39:34,741 --> 01:39:36,840
some guy's gonna come over and
rip a left hook to your liver.

3688
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:37,191
Like what?

3689
01:39:37,191 --> 01:39:38,130
Oh he wasn't ready for it.

3690
01:39:38,131 --> 01:39:41,460
He didn't know cause cause you don't
allow them to do it and that's what you're

3691
01:39:41,461 --> 01:39:45,210
seeing with like glory and not allowing
these guys to do like one of the best

3692
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:46,500
aspects of striking.

3693
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,390
And then with [inaudible] in general too,

3694
01:39:48,391 --> 01:39:50,880
like this is so hard to find
a full Moitai show these days,

3695
01:39:50,881 --> 01:39:51,900
like full toy,

3696
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:52,620
like five rounds.

3697
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,340
A lot of the guys are gone,

3698
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,900
three threes now for the promotions.

3699
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:58,440
And then I think their main
concern is if I do an elbow fight,

3700
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:01,890
I bring someone from Thailand or
Australia to America and the fight last 30

3701
01:40:01,891 --> 01:40:02,940
seconds and the guy gets cut.

3702
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,120
I've just wasted 10
grand on a plane tickets.

3703
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:06,530
And I say,

3704
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:08,130
I said it's one of the big concerns.

3705
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:09,420
Yeah man,

3706
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:10,141
I get it.

3707
01:40:10,141 --> 01:40:11,490
But still just it's,

3708
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,810
I think if you're representing
martial arts like on television,

3709
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:16,860
I mean they can do whatever they want.

3710
01:40:16,861 --> 01:40:18,420
The Japanese had their ideas.

3711
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:22,020
We don't have to keep the same
ideas as the Japanese with glory.

3712
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:23,040
I think they should go with,

3713
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:24,330
that's why I like lion fight.

3714
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,470
I really like what they're doing,

3715
01:40:25,471 --> 01:40:25,681
man.

3716
01:40:25,681 --> 01:40:27,390
I like their full morning time.

3717
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:27,720
Yeah,

3718
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:27,960
I'm,

3719
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:28,350
I'm really,

3720
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:29,161
I'm a purist as well,

3721
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:30,850
so they can clench and which they,

3722
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,040
they hold onto each other,

3723
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:32,701
throw each other,

3724
01:40:32,701 --> 01:40:33,660
they'd dump each other,

3725
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,350
they hold kicks and uh,

3726
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,020
their whole little cadre kick and fuck.

3727
01:40:37,021 --> 01:40:38,290
Kick your leg out from under you.

3728
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:38,611
John,

3729
01:40:38,611 --> 01:40:41,790
what do you think about the
multiple fights in a night?

3730
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,490
Single night.

3731
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:42,670
Ah,

3732
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:43,411
I used to do it.

3733
01:40:43,411 --> 01:40:44,130
You're a fan of it.

3734
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:45,150
I've done a couple of them before.

3735
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:46,620
I want a big one in Thailand.

3736
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:47,483
In Bangkok.

3737
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:48,413
Uh,

3738
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:49,830
when I was younger I used to love him,

3739
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:50,310
but now,

3740
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:51,540
now I'm a bit older and the body doesn't,

3741
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:53,970
repairs is fast in the breaks

3742
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,530
anymore because when I was watching glory,

3743
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:59,920
that's the main thing I was thinking
about this guys who would have a battle

3744
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:03,640
that first fight and have to back
out and like Damn Joe Schilling.

3745
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:05,980
Joe Schilling fought four
rounds of Simon Marcus.

3746
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,450
They go to the third round.

3747
01:41:07,451 --> 01:41:08,111
It's a draw.

3748
01:41:08,111 --> 01:41:09,310
They have to fight a fourth round.

3749
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:13,780
He's got two fights after that knocks
mark is out in the fourth fucking round.

3750
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:17,560
Then he's got to fight Wayne Barrett
and he's got to fight our Tim 11 and the

3751
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,780
final fuck too much.

3752
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:19,970
Yeah,

3753
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:20,530
it's hard.

3754
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:21,050
It's so,

3755
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:24,340
Hud sees our Ferrara and
Sam Alvey this a good fight.

3756
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:25,690
The good fight.

3757
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:26,680
What do you know about Alvey?

3758
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:29,320
A Alvie was a contestant on,

3759
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:31,720
he was on a team Carwyn
on the ultimate fighter.

3760
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,673
And I gotta be honest,

3761
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:35,680
I'm surprised the kids here now because
when he was on the ultimate fighter,

3762
01:41:35,681 --> 01:41:36,580
I was a guest coach.

3763
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:38,153
He would quit.

3764
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:40,060
He quit all the time and I was real.

3765
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:40,990
This kid doesn't have it.

3766
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,400
He got his training,

3767
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:43,480
he got injured,

3768
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:47,260
and then he came back for a little
bit and he was their first pick.

3769
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:49,090
He was the very first picking.

3770
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:50,680
It did not work out on the show.

3771
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:51,610
I was like,

3772
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:51,731
go.

3773
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:52,451
The kid doesn't have it.

3774
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:52,650
Soon.

3775
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:54,160
Went to MFC in Canada,

3776
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:54,730
uh,

3777
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,451
did great there,

3778
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:57,010
and then got back into the UFC.

3779
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,970
He won his last fight against
Tom Watson and now Caesar,

3780
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:00,813
the guy he's fighting,

3781
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:01,451
uh,

3782
01:42:01,451 --> 01:42:02,770
I trained with for a while,

3783
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:03,161
uh,

3784
01:42:03,161 --> 01:42:03,994
at the,

3785
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:04,570
uh,

3786
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:05,500
with vittores camp.

3787
01:42:05,501 --> 01:42:06,400
He's like little beat door.

3788
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:08,110
So this guy's a freak.

3789
01:42:08,111 --> 01:42:08,920
Athletically.

3790
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,170
He trained under Anderson
Silva for two years.

3791
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:16,350
He trained with Leo Machida and now he's
Veit tours like pro DJ and he's such a

3792
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:17,380
good athlete man.

3793
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:18,041
Yeah.

3794
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:19,730
I watched him fight um,

3795
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:20,500
uh,

3796
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:20,920
surge.

3797
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,671
You uh,

3798
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:22,810
what is his name for the,

3799
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:23,720
for the title,

3800
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:24,820
the ultimate fighter Brazil.

3801
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:25,730
Sergio.

3802
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:25,950
No,

3803
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:26,290
it was him.

3804
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:27,101
He looks thinner.

3805
01:42:27,101 --> 01:42:28,900
He looks a lot thinner than he
did in the ultimate fighter.

3806
01:42:28,901 --> 01:42:30,080
This guy and I said,

3807
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:30,911
yeah,

3808
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:31,744
we went down.

3809
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:32,703
He did.

3810
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:33,971
He's fighting one,

3811
01:42:33,971 --> 01:42:34,111
eight,

3812
01:42:34,111 --> 01:42:34,331
five,

3813
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:37,420
I think it was 2:05 PM
he's gotten smaller,

3814
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:38,350
I think.

3815
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:39,183
Does that make sense?

3816
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:39,640
Yeah,

3817
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,271
that's what it looks like.

3818
01:42:40,271 --> 01:42:40,990
Hi.

3819
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:41,823
Where's the heart?

3820
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,690
That's true.

3821
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:43,523
They go,

3822
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,280
we've got to come up
with something for them.

3823
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:45,551
That's,

3824
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:46,384
he's on tits.

3825
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:48,460
They're going to start throwing tens up.

3826
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:49,990
Here we go.

3827
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:50,711
His fighting style.

3828
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:51,131
It's crazy,

3829
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:51,790
man.

3830
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:52,571
I don't think a,

3831
01:42:52,571 --> 01:42:54,640
I don't think the ginger
has a chance here.

3832
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:55,420
Big.

3833
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,530
The ginger is tough though.

3834
01:42:56,531 --> 01:42:59,380
The man really sharp and his last
couple of fights he beat Tom Watson.

3835
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:00,130
You know Tom,

3836
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:03,790
he did be Tom Watson on
that different Amad though.

3837
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:04,930
Caesar's a different animal.

3838
01:43:04,931 --> 01:43:05,230
Man.

3839
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:06,080
Surgical Mariah.

3840
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,933
That's who it was.

3841
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:08,590
Try it was driving me fucking nuts.

3842
01:43:08,591 --> 01:43:09,520
I'm trying to remember his name.

3843
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:12,730
Cesar is one of the best athletes
in the UFC that I've seen more.

3844
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:14,230
I choked out crone.

3845
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,400
It was like the first
guy to beat him when he,

3846
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,120
when he got his black belt.

3847
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,130
That's his background a couple of weeks.

3848
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:22,493
Yeah.

3849
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:22,960
Dude,

3850
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:23,800
that was nice.

3851
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:24,150
Yeah,

3852
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:26,200
that Shit like a jab as fast.

3853
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:27,611
You haven't seen mine,

3854
01:43:27,611 --> 01:43:28,970
but you get the off front kick.

3855
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:30,070
He gets more comfortable,

3856
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:30,904
man.

3857
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:32,500
Fucking nightmare.

3858
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,071
Oh,

3859
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:35,710
another one hit 'em with the front body.

3860
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:38,230
Speaking of body shots,

3861
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:38,681
hey Sam,

3862
01:43:38,681 --> 01:43:42,240
go ahead and fly 17 hours of Brazil
and fight a Cesar Mouton Day.

3863
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:43,610
Enjoy this by me.

3864
01:43:43,611 --> 01:43:44,444
I like that.

3865
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:46,263
I like that.

3866
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:47,010
Yeah.

3867
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:48,220
He's just on that tough contract.

3868
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,480
Speaking of tough contract,

3869
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,800
I made a mistake last
time I was on your show,

3870
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:52,100
John,

3871
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,000
the fight companion.

3872
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:55,490
I said I got paid 10 and
10 or eight and eight.

3873
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:58,160
It was actually 14 and 14 my bad.

3874
01:43:58,410 --> 01:43:58,880
Ooh.

3875
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,220
I just learned that they just said,

3876
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:01,371
hey,

3877
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:02,120
please,

3878
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,540
please let people know that
you actually made 14 to fight.

3879
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,720
They looked the Nogueira and I made 14,

3880
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:09,380
14 to fight Mirko Cro cop,

3881
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,070
my bad,

3882
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:11,000
my bad Joe Silva,

3883
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:11,710
Dana White.

3884
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:12,410
Gotcha.

3885
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:12,981
That's all it is.

3886
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:14,870
There was no bonuses or
anything else involved.

3887
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:15,620
Uh,

3888
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,580
I did get a bonus.

3889
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:17,900
I was just talking about contracts.

3890
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:18,763
I get up Toronto,

3891
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:19,580
uh,

3892
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:21,230
for knockout of the night
when I thought Mirko Cro,

3893
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:24,680
cop rich and she hit
for that for that night.

3894
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,630
For that night I bought a car.

3895
01:44:26,631 --> 01:44:27,730
And so what,

3896
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,580
what is your football patty on exactly.

3897
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,030
I never really got into that.

3898
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:33,260
You did you play pro football?

3899
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:33,560
Uh,

3900
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,101
just for,

3901
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:36,860
I'd like a cup of coffee with the
buffalo bills and went back home.

3902
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,730
Practice squad.

3903
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:38,390
Yeah.

3904
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:38,571
Yeah.

3905
01:44:38,571 --> 01:44:42,110
I played division one football for
University of Colorado and then went to

3906
01:44:42,111 --> 01:44:42,970
training camp bills.

3907
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:44,650
I was a tight in Hvac.

3908
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:46,103
Got Good hands.

3909
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:47,203
Yeah.

3910
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:48,870
You got to say your,

3911
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,140
your hands got to be amazing
if you're a white guy.

3912
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:51,591
Yeah.

3913
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:52,220
Not Bad.

3914
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:52,600
I mean,

3915
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,211
be a white,

3916
01:44:53,211 --> 01:44:54,260
tight end and drop balls.

3917
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:54,871
He's pretty fun.

3918
01:44:54,871 --> 01:44:56,210
I agree 100% right.

3919
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:56,750
You're right.

3920
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:58,760
They're not going to let
white guys drop any balls.

3921
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:01,660
You got to be a black guy and you could
drop ball again cause you're going to

3922
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:05,310
make it up later because white
guys and really white you.

3923
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:06,021
I gotta be honest.

3924
01:45:06,021 --> 01:45:08,720
It was the first time I realized
that in sports it's a business.

3925
01:45:08,721 --> 01:45:10,160
When I got to Buffalo I was like,

3926
01:45:10,161 --> 01:45:10,731
Oh shit.

3927
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:11,564
It broke my heart.

3928
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:12,051
I'm like,

3929
01:45:12,051 --> 01:45:12,231
oh,

3930
01:45:12,231 --> 01:45:15,950
it's really not a team concept and they
don't give a shit about me and it broke

3931
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:16,310
my heart.

3932
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,150
Man Really got back.

3933
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:18,950
Oh he's thrown that.

3934
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:21,170
We'll kick a lot through it again.

3935
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,860
Alvey is yet to get something
significant and trying to get,

3936
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:25,880
he's trying to figure him out,

3937
01:45:25,881 --> 01:45:26,180
man.

3938
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,013
Good luck.

3939
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:30,320
How was your college career?

3940
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:33,170
You a good eye for Colorado.

3941
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:33,500
Yeah,

3942
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,280
the gold helmets.

3943
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:34,441
Yeah,

3944
01:45:34,441 --> 01:45:35,210
the gold helmets.

3945
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:36,043
He started,

3946
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,033
uh,

3947
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:38,060
no,

3948
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:38,480
no,

3949
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:38,630
I,

3950
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,770
I w I worked in,

3951
01:45:39,771 --> 01:45:40,820
I had to uh,

3952
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,920
a first round and second
round draft pick ahead of me.

3953
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,233
I'm a shit.

3954
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:45,820
When you got to the bills,

3955
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:49,000
like what was it that made
it seem like I'm busy.

3956
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,300
Business broke your heart.

3957
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:51,253
Uh,

3958
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:52,220
when you,

3959
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,120
when when I got there,

3960
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:55,640
I wasn't a draft pick as a free agent,

3961
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:55,911
you know,

3962
01:45:55,911 --> 01:46:00,020
so you're basically like a body that
they're bringing in and it was like they

3963
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:01,580
wouldn't even talk to me
and look me in the eye.

3964
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,230
There's just like a 43 over there,

3965
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:03,710
man.

3966
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:04,491
Get the fuck over there,

3967
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:04,850
you know?

3968
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:05,300
Wow.

3969
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:05,500
Yeah.

3970
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,020
Just a Bot.

3971
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:06,950
They don't give a shit about you.

3972
01:46:06,951 --> 01:46:08,030
They just don't have time for it.

3973
01:46:08,031 --> 01:46:09,890
They don't have time to be a friend
now you got to understand that.

3974
01:46:09,891 --> 01:46:10,071
Right.

3975
01:46:10,071 --> 01:46:10,670
It's a business.

3976
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:11,960
That was when I first realized,

3977
01:46:11,961 --> 01:46:12,721
cause you go from college,

3978
01:46:12,721 --> 01:46:16,430
which is about a team and hard
work till you get to the NFL.

3979
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:17,000
It's like,

3980
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,680
oh we don't have anything invested in you.

3981
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:25,340
Shit not dead.

3982
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:26,810
Oh boy.

3983
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:30,710
Huge wind for Alvie God
damn shit out of nowhere.

3984
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,750
Even with that left Hook Dude,

3985
01:46:32,751 --> 01:46:33,970
he was not shipped in.

3986
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:34,970
Brazil's nice.

3987
01:46:34,971 --> 01:46:35,804
My Sam,

3988
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:38,720
his fucking time biding his time.

3989
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,450
Landed that left Hook and
you're doing Caesar's.

3990
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,313
Get light skin.

3991
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:47,270
I think he has a girl or he
did when he's on the show.

3992
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:48,470
You know what the problem is,

3993
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:50,070
is with would alarm me

3994
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,820
as he goes.

3995
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:53,310
Well my training camp every
night to fight night in Brazil,

3996
01:46:53,311 --> 01:46:56,580
we spar so hard on Tuesday and Thursday
night every night to fight camp.

3997
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,211
When I heard that,

3998
01:46:57,211 --> 01:46:57,511
I'm like,

3999
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:58,740
well that's an issue.

4000
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,020
Your chance I can to hold up for too much.

4001
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,113
It's already gone.

4002
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:02,700
Dams,

4003
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,690
two knockouts.

4004
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:04,621
Cj.

4005
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:05,310
Dot.

4006
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:05,611
Yeah.

4007
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:05,860
Dot.

4008
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:06,930
Galloway Galloway.

4009
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:07,471
Now this.

4010
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:07,760
Huh?

4011
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,040
Cause he be Dalloway knocks him out
and then Alvie with this left talk.

4012
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:11,420
Watch this.

4013
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:12,150
Oh,

4014
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:12,990
that was sick.

4015
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:15,363
Boom.

4016
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:15,830
Oh.

4017
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,740
Says Oh

4018
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:18,481
wow.

4019
01:47:18,481 --> 01:47:19,001
That was nice.

4020
01:47:19,001 --> 01:47:20,450
It was shovel.

4021
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:23,550
He even hesitated like
Mario was going to stop it.

4022
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:24,600
Look at that.

4023
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:25,433
Right.

4024
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:28,250
All that left shows nice sort of.

4025
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:30,560
Oh it

4026
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,021
wasn't too much.

4027
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:32,290
Got Shut off for a second.

4028
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:33,270
Yeah.

4029
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:34,103
There was a

4030
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:36,690
huge win for Sam.

4031
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:38,300
He doesn't man.

4032
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:39,560
Ah,

4033
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,110
AH,

4034
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:40,850
AH,

4035
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:42,880
Z wouldn't know the smiley
face hair cut on the back.

4036
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:44,680
You see he has a smiley face.

4037
01:47:44,681 --> 01:47:45,514
Yeah.

4038
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:46,330
I thought it was wearing,

4039
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:47,163
he'll get him.

4040
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:47,831
Damn.

4041
01:47:47,831 --> 01:47:48,670
That is dark.

4042
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:49,570
We can those eyes.

4043
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:51,430
It's gonna be a dark night for Caesar.

4044
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:51,791
Kellen,

4045
01:47:51,791 --> 01:47:52,624
what'd you think of that?

4046
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:56,320
I'm wondering if that's
his sister or his wife,

4047
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:57,183
but they look good.

4048
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:58,293
Don't be rude.

4049
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,710
I'm pretty sure that his wife,

4050
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:04,150
I'm pretty sure,

4051
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:06,670
I'm sure someone to tell me
what he looks very happy.

4052
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:07,421
Well,

4053
01:48:07,421 --> 01:48:07,631
yeah,

4054
01:48:07,631 --> 01:48:10,690
he's happy about to get weird.

4055
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:11,590
Unless that's his wife.

4056
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:12,424
That's when you get to win.

4057
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:14,110
Maybe his wash the freak.

4058
01:48:14,111 --> 01:48:14,920
You never know.

4059
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,120
You never know.

4060
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:17,080
You never know.

4061
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:17,980
Never know.

4062
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:18,843
Let's hope she is.

4063
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:23,710
It makes the story fun or that was
a good fucking combination man.

4064
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:24,663
Nasty.

4065
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:25,800
That say's it.

4066
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:26,381
Ferera guy.

4067
01:48:26,381 --> 01:48:29,860
What you said is giant where you said
it's giant about those live where I was

4068
01:48:29,861 --> 01:48:31,150
reading interviews and he goes,

4069
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:35,740
I'm not too nervous because
it every Tuesday and Thursday
and my camp is a fight

4070
01:48:35,741 --> 01:48:36,670
night in Brazil.

4071
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:37,930
We spar so hard and went,

4072
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:38,580
Oh,

4073
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,910
oh Caesar.

4074
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:41,470
He have so much talent.

4075
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,760
Don't do that chatty.

4076
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:45,630
Pronounce my shit.

4077
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,913
My Shit.

4078
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:49,970
Yo talk when you hear that good Joe.

4079
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,610
He's like the old school,

4080
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:52,210
uh,

4081
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:55,150
pursuing the top team and stuff like
that with wanderlust was beating the shit

4082
01:48:55,151 --> 01:48:57,040
out of each other in practice and taking,

4083
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:57,431
yeah,

4084
01:48:57,431 --> 01:48:58,630
they shoot box guys.

4085
01:48:58,631 --> 01:48:58,811
Yeah.

4086
01:48:58,811 --> 01:49:00,000
Shoot box presented top team.

4087
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:00,940
They should go hardest

4088
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:03,520
knocking each other out.

4089
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:05,950
Oh yeah.

4090
01:49:05,951 --> 01:49:06,551
It's weird.

4091
01:49:06,551 --> 01:49:08,290
They didn't know John before.

4092
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:08,470
Uh,

4093
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:09,101
before a match.

4094
01:49:09,101 --> 01:49:11,080
How hard do you spar a boxing?

4095
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:13,000
About 90%.

4096
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,950
And I understand and
then type we just play.

4097
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:16,323
Yeah,

4098
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:17,321
just feeling each other out.

4099
01:49:17,321 --> 01:49:17,540
You know,

4100
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:21,250
you're not really not taking hits to the
head nine in Taco Moitai you just play.

4101
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:22,263
What do you mean?

4102
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:23,231
In Thailand we don't even,

4103
01:49:23,231 --> 01:49:25,210
where she in peds is so
controlled and then you know,

4104
01:49:25,211 --> 01:49:26,060
if he got hit you can,

4105
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:27,040
you can place your Shin across.

4106
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:28,870
You're going to go out fast
and then last I can pull it.

4107
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:32,350
It's like being a martial artist says how
do that to pull a shot the just to let

4108
01:49:32,351 --> 01:49:33,180
go.

4109
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:34,630
So it's actually a good workout today.

4110
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:35,771
It's so much fun.

4111
01:49:35,771 --> 01:49:37,660
And then you're smiling
and then end of it.

4112
01:49:37,661 --> 01:49:38,231
No one's hurt,

4113
01:49:38,231 --> 01:49:38,891
no bruises.

4114
01:49:38,891 --> 01:49:39,581
You're not limping.

4115
01:49:39,581 --> 01:49:40,450
And then you're still friends.

4116
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,450
Damn Dude,

4117
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:42,941
I had to,

4118
01:49:42,941 --> 01:49:43,631
I feel like though,

4119
01:49:43,631 --> 01:49:44,021
when you,

4120
01:49:44,021 --> 01:49:46,210
when you up the pace in a real fight,

4121
01:49:46,570 --> 01:49:46,901
it doesn't,

4122
01:49:46,901 --> 01:49:48,070
it isn't it hard

4123
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,290
to kind of make that adjustment because
you're going so hot on the peds and,

4124
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:52,310
and when I box spa,

4125
01:49:52,311 --> 01:49:56,570
I'm getting my workout because I'm trying
to really hit my mate who I spoke with

4126
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,700
regularly and um,

4127
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:58,630
uh,

4128
01:49:58,630 --> 01:49:58,840
but,

4129
01:49:58,840 --> 01:49:59,040
but,

4130
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,640
and there's no hard
feelings and when we box,

4131
01:50:00,641 --> 01:50:01,330
but I don't know,

4132
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:02,021
just the Thai style,

4133
01:50:02,021 --> 01:50:02,860
it's just the way they do it.

4134
01:50:02,861 --> 01:50:03,410
And it's just you,

4135
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:04,660
you don't say much on the pads and,

4136
01:50:04,661 --> 01:50:07,810
and the bag and then the clinching that
you used to working with technique by

4137
01:50:07,811 --> 01:50:09,370
the time you get to the spine pot.

4138
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:10,443
Wow.

4139
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,830
That's interesting man.

4140
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:14,860
I think that's a smart strategy
for someone who fights a lot too.

4141
01:50:14,861 --> 01:50:16,930
Cause the ties would fight
pretty much every week.

4142
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:18,160
And I've had longevity.

4143
01:50:18,161 --> 01:50:18,990
I have no injuries.

4144
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:20,140
You don't need to get tougher.

4145
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:21,640
You know how to spar and take kits.

4146
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:21,821
You know,

4147
01:50:21,821 --> 01:50:23,260
you're tough enough when
you get to that level.

4148
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:25,150
So it's just about repetition,

4149
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,113
getting comfortable.

4150
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:27,790
The erroneous assumption,

4151
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:28,031
right.

4152
01:50:28,031 --> 01:50:29,870
They'd like fighting training hard.

4153
01:50:29,871 --> 01:50:30,730
He's going to make you tougher.

4154
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:31,120
No,

4155
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,290
you're at that level.

4156
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:33,520
You're already pretty tough.

4157
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,340
We don't need the challenges that,

4158
01:50:35,341 --> 01:50:36,670
that train since then when they buy it,

4159
01:50:36,671 --> 01:50:38,110
they get pretty crazy and then,

4160
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:39,070
but they think of it,

4161
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:41,080
well if I get hit in the spring like this,

4162
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:41,560
when I fight,

4163
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,790
there's going to be new in the shock.

4164
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:43,990
But the Dutch go harder.

4165
01:50:43,991 --> 01:50:46,450
The legs and the body and they kind
of lay off the head a little bit.

4166
01:50:46,451 --> 01:50:47,620
And some camps,

4167
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:48,160
yes.

4168
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,420
And then like Mike's gym,

4169
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:51,000
they're known for knocking each other out.

4170
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:51,790
Jim Cole,

4171
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:52,840
Mike's Jane Golden Glory,

4172
01:50:52,841 --> 01:50:53,110
right.

4173
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:53,651
Golden Glory.

4174
01:50:53,651 --> 01:50:54,490
They knock each other out.

4175
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:55,513
Not Bad.

4176
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,141
Well there's,

4177
01:50:56,141 --> 01:50:56,790
you know,

4178
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:57,460
you're dealing with,

4179
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,890
you got 18 murders in a room together.

4180
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,790
All do.

4181
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,810
They're all padded out.

4182
01:51:01,811 --> 01:51:03,580
It just takes a little bit of education.

4183
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,560
Like whoa,

4184
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,610
it's not going to work
on some of those dudes.

4185
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:08,830
God just got here from Morocco.

4186
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,620
Leader is if we don't play that game,

4187
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:12,020
son.

4188
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:12,490
Yeah.

4189
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:13,870
And then I'm running a family gym too.

4190
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:15,500
So I want kids to come in.

4191
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,310
I like the parents are watching on what
and then the feel comfortable with,

4192
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,500
I can walk away with it.

4193
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:22,450
The kids getting knocked out cause
so when you have young kids spar,

4194
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:23,740
when they first learned how to spar,

4195
01:51:23,741 --> 01:51:24,550
what do you,

4196
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:27,560
how do you emphasize like
the playful aspect of it.

4197
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:30,310
They see us doing that and they just want
to copy and I tell him to okay before

4198
01:51:30,311 --> 01:51:30,701
we start,

4199
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:34,420
everyone's going 10 15% they're higher
than 20% otherwise you can sit out and

4200
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:35,254
not play.

4201
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,550
And then um,

4202
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:38,410
and then I'll just keep
keeping on him as well.

4203
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,710
He just make sure he 10 15% no
harder than 20% that's beautiful.

4204
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:43,000
And then when they want to go hard,

4205
01:51:43,001 --> 01:51:43,691
you hit the bag,

4206
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:44,441
you hit the pads.

4207
01:51:44,441 --> 01:51:44,740
Yes.

4208
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:45,071
Your work,

4209
01:51:45,071 --> 01:51:45,701
your technique,

4210
01:51:45,701 --> 01:51:47,410
you understand your timing
and your confidence.

4211
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:49,990
And then he still looking
at timing with aspiring to,

4212
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,190
he's still for hundred fast.

4213
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:52,213
These still,

4214
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,410
you can again just go slow.

4215
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:55,530
You're not going to name your shot so
you're still a bit and then just said

4216
01:51:55,531 --> 01:51:57,850
you're laying on the ribs are their
thought or even across their neck.

4217
01:51:57,930 --> 01:52:00,460
Just pull it back but just landed
there and leave it there for a second.

4218
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:02,290
Make sure everyone sees
first and then take it down.

4219
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:04,810
That's a smart way to do it.

4220
01:52:04,811 --> 01:52:07,880
But do you think they could do that with
MMA because you're dealing with take

4221
01:52:07,881 --> 01:52:10,870
downs and you have to be
really quick with your sprawl.

4222
01:52:10,871 --> 01:52:14,140
You have to be quick with the transitions
between grappling and striking.

4223
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:15,720
Do you think it's possible to do that too?

4224
01:52:15,721 --> 01:52:17,980
We were just still just
pulling back on everything.

4225
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,700
Um,

4226
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:21,610
I've got to work with George Saint Pierre
for two weeks and then that's a weird

4227
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:22,090
play.

4228
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:24,730
We wouldn't go any higher than 30% maybe,

4229
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:25,781
but we were just,

4230
01:52:25,781 --> 01:52:26,200
um,

4231
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:26,461
the,

4232
01:52:26,461 --> 01:52:28,060
the whole time we've been than control

4233
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,550
kickboxing,

4234
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:35,050
remote control robot that had
punches that had like balloons,

4235
01:52:35,051 --> 01:52:37,440
like when they land there
was a balloon fucking and,

4236
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,810
and you can really hit
the what not seriously.

4237
01:52:41,230 --> 01:52:42,370
And you can hit this,

4238
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:43,330
this,

4239
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:45,070
this robot is hard as you can.

4240
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:47,780
So you're throwing hard punches
and it's throwing legit.

4241
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:49,820
It's legit.

4242
01:52:49,821 --> 01:52:50,270
Uh,

4243
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:51,470
not as legit as Megan right here,

4244
01:52:51,471 --> 01:52:51,801
of course.

4245
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:53,240
But it's going to happen.

4246
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:56,470
Probably some really good trainers.

4247
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,560
The guy who controls it,

4248
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,460
that would be like,

4249
01:52:58,460 --> 01:52:59,630
you'd have to be really good at it.

4250
01:52:59,830 --> 01:53:00,620
You know,

4251
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:02,070
video games to be a great child.

4252
01:53:02,070 --> 01:53:05,540
Like you could take someone
who could never kick your ass,

4253
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:07,730
but they get pilot a robot
that can kick your ass.

4254
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:09,790
So you'd go in there and have to do,

4255
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:13,280
and then they would seek out to be
guys with the best robots and the

4256
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:16,970
robots way before they mfi robots.

4257
01:53:17,370 --> 01:53:20,270
There'll be sparring robots.

4258
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:20,791
Think about it.

4259
01:53:20,791 --> 01:53:21,381
How cool would that,

4260
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:22,490
isn't is the movie already

4261
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:25,881
Jack?

4262
01:53:25,881 --> 01:53:26,211
Really?

4263
01:53:26,211 --> 01:53:27,290
They're sparring robot.

4264
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:27,491
Well,

4265
01:53:27,491 --> 01:53:29,750
they were giant robot each other.

4266
01:53:29,751 --> 01:53:30,650
They didn't fight people.

4267
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,760
When you're talking about sparring robots,

4268
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:36,110
keep it real and mixed
martial arts for boxing,

4269
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:38,960
for kickboxing up for the
striking arts in general

4270
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:45,110
coming out and what's going
on with his facial hair.

4271
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:50,330
I like it some this is that really his
twin brother might be faking it is Edson

4272
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:51,220
face his face.

4273
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:52,011
He looks so different.

4274
01:53:52,011 --> 01:53:53,770
I never seen him do look
so different with a beer.

4275
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:56,030
Harry looks first.

4276
01:53:56,031 --> 01:53:58,870
We'll kick Kao ever in MMA history Edson,

4277
01:53:58,900 --> 01:53:59,201
but well,

4278
01:53:59,201 --> 01:54:03,920
at least in UFC Johnson he
started as a wrestler or was he,

4279
01:54:03,921 --> 01:54:05,630
if I kick her first wrestler first,

4280
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,420
it was crazy about that cat knockout was,

4281
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:13,000
I kind of called it and I said that if
he's the only way he's gonna he's gonna

4282
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:14,030
have to take some risks,

4283
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:14,951
but if it takes a rest,

4284
01:54:14,951 --> 01:54:16,970
he runs the risk of getting knocked out.

4285
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,481
Like,

4286
01:54:17,481 --> 01:54:18,830
as I said out,

4287
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:20,060
he was out cold.

4288
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,710
Like literally as I was saying,

4289
01:54:21,711 --> 01:54:22,580
knocked out.

4290
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:23,511
He's dead,

4291
01:54:23,511 --> 01:54:25,970
stiff flying through the air on his back.

4292
01:54:25,971 --> 01:54:26,930
It's crazy timing.

4293
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:30,530
Crazy ridiculous timing to
say that total dumb luck.

4294
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:31,980
But what a wheel care.

4295
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,230
Who the fucks all of that coming.

4296
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:36,290
Probably the best knockdown
in UFC history right up there.

4297
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:36,621
Cro,

4298
01:54:36,621 --> 01:54:37,101
cop,

4299
01:54:37,101 --> 01:54:39,330
Gonzaga Pedis.

4300
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:40,510
Joe Lozan.

4301
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:41,833
Um,

4302
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,260
that's,

4303
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:44,510
that was fucking sensational head kick.

4304
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:46,760
But I'm talking about Edson and Terry.

4305
01:54:46,761 --> 01:54:47,080
Adam,

4306
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,170
just when Terry,

4307
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:49,004
Adam was just,

4308
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:49,311
I was like,

4309
01:54:49,311 --> 01:54:51,680
Oh shit that's in killed
the guy dead stiff.

4310
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,083
I thought he killed her.

4311
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:55,820
There's a bunch of cro cop Gonzaga.

4312
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:56,421
So crazy.

4313
01:54:56,421 --> 01:54:58,370
Cause no one thought
Gonzaga would win that way.

4314
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:01,190
How's Gonzaga gonna head kick cro cop.

4315
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:04,490
He think of all the cro cop
highlight reel head kicks.

4316
01:55:04,491 --> 01:55:05,350
How the fuck has guns?

4317
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:10,190
Zaga back son Cro cops thrown Gonzaga,

4318
01:55:10,191 --> 01:55:10,700
right?

4319
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:10,970
Yup.

4320
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:13,670
He's fighting Gonzaga and Poland rematch.

4321
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:14,960
He's back.

4322
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:15,741
You know why too,

4323
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:16,040
right?

4324
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,370
Why?

4325
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:20,180
Because they were talking to him
was Bella Bella toes talking.

4326
01:55:20,181 --> 01:55:20,650
Oh,

4327
01:55:20,650 --> 01:55:22,520
and the UFC said not so fast.

4328
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:23,931
Not so fast.

4329
01:55:23,931 --> 01:55:25,640
Do you believe that relationship,

4330
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:27,880
what's called copy talking about

4331
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,940
fade or signing with bill or,

4332
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:32,570
well he,

4333
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:34,370
I mean physically signing autographs.

4334
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:34,730
Rebelling.

4335
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:35,960
Oh Jesus Christ came,

4336
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,840
he scared the shit.

4337
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:38,300
I would like,

4338
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:38,511
look,

4339
01:55:38,511 --> 01:55:38,701
I'm,

4340
01:55:38,701 --> 01:55:39,171
I'm not,

4341
01:55:39,171 --> 01:55:39,500
uh,

4342
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:40,070
you know,

4343
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:41,240
I'm loyal to the UFC,

4344
01:55:41,241 --> 01:55:43,760
but I would not be angry
if they sign fade or,

4345
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:44,603
and Brock,

4346
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:47,880
have they signed fado versus
Brian Browse on Bellator.

4347
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:48,953
That'd be,

4348
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,180
I heard Bob talking
about concussions though.

4349
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:51,661
Yeah,

4350
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:53,370
he's talking about concussion supposedly.

4351
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:57,150
But that's according to like
the pro wrestling guys who
knows what angle they're

4352
01:55:57,151 --> 01:55:57,900
plan.

4353
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,610
You know those guys are always,

4354
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:03,510
there's so much showmanship and
craziness in the world of pro wrestling.

4355
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:05,010
Like I'm starting to
understand that better.

4356
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:08,700
Being friends with Tony Hinchcliffe cause
he fucking loves pro wrestling and he

4357
01:56:08,701 --> 01:56:09,750
never stops talking about it.

4358
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,950
I kind of just tend like they play things
out in advance like way in advance for

4359
01:56:13,951 --> 01:56:16,740
like long periods of times
we'd have these timelines.

4360
01:56:16,741 --> 01:56:19,200
You storylines they
follow like soap operas.

4361
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:19,531
Yeah,

4362
01:56:19,531 --> 01:56:20,071
exactly.

4363
01:56:20,071 --> 01:56:20,904
So when he says,

4364
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:22,050
yeah,

4365
01:56:22,050 --> 01:56:23,610
Brock's worried about concussions,

4366
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:27,180
they might have some crazy
match that they're setting up.

4367
01:56:27,181 --> 01:56:29,580
We're Brock is scared to get hit
in the head and they start talking,

4368
01:56:29,581 --> 01:56:32,760
he's scared to get hit in the head and
they and Brock runs away like holding his

4369
01:56:32,761 --> 01:56:33,594
head.

4370
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:37,100
You kept anything those
guys don't scripted.

4371
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:38,200
It's so weird to me

4372
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:40,980
how grown men get into,

4373
01:56:40,981 --> 01:56:41,880
they get into it.

4374
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:42,210
Dude,

4375
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:45,610
I dated a girl who was super into it
and it's hard to take her serious tip.

4376
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:48,350
It's off fee after you did it grow,

4377
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,090
do you throw wheel kicks,

4378
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:55,380
jumping,

4379
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:55,681
jumping,

4380
01:56:55,681 --> 01:56:55,981
spinning.

4381
01:56:55,981 --> 01:56:56,814
Becky's,

4382
01:56:57,090 --> 01:57:01,570
there's sort of like a look like
I only if I'm running buddy,

4383
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:03,540
it's an inside joke.

4384
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:04,643
It's all right.

4385
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:05,640
It's crazy inside.

4386
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:06,533
If I'm winning

4387
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:10,680
I'm not going to lose sort of thing.

4388
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:12,240
They're not throw it just
for show for the fans.

4389
01:57:12,241 --> 01:57:13,051
But if not,

4390
01:57:13,051 --> 01:57:13,861
I wouldn't throw it.

4391
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:14,700
I make sure I'm running for this.

4392
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:15,720
Okay.

4393
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:18,570
So that's something if you're beating
the guys asked you might throat like a

4394
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:19,111
slam dunk.

4395
01:57:19,111 --> 01:57:22,560
He doesn't only do it if you know that
you can easier to pull off like stuff

4396
01:57:22,561 --> 01:57:25,860
like wheel kicks when you're adding and
all the other shit like take downs and

4397
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:27,570
all the other things like so it makes,

4398
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:30,330
it's like there's so many
variables then maybe get it off.

4399
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:33,390
Whereas like if you're fighting
and Moyie Thai and he got all the,

4400
01:57:33,391 --> 01:57:36,960
the leg kicks and all the things you
could do much quicker and faster to land,

4401
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,270
but it's like less high
percentage that way.

4402
01:57:39,370 --> 01:57:39,571
The,

4403
01:57:39,571 --> 01:57:41,820
the main train is just
trying to stay away from him.

4404
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:43,200
That ties would never do it.

4405
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:44,640
But um,

4406
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:44,881
yeah,

4407
01:57:44,881 --> 01:57:46,020
they never throw wheel kit.

4408
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:47,663
They,

4409
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:51,240
they Manson Gibson used to throw
them right back in the day.

4410
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:55,050
That mother fucker out of vicious we'll
kick but maybe they didn't throw him

4411
01:57:55,051 --> 01:57:55,884
because uh,

4412
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:59,310
just because they didn't throw him doesn't
mean they can't be really effective.

4413
01:57:59,311 --> 01:57:59,610
Right.

4414
01:57:59,610 --> 01:58:02,870
I came from that background and then we
used to do them all the time and turn it

4415
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:03,800
back when I was like 11,

4416
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:06,840
12 and then I want to got
to keep books and they said,

4417
01:58:06,841 --> 01:58:07,240
okay,

4418
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,910
this ain't throwing any of
these spinning kicks anymore.

4419
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:09,511
It's too dangerous.

4420
01:58:09,511 --> 01:58:11,440
You got to stay front of him
the whole time and keep it,

4421
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:13,080
keep it basic and Rancic front.

4422
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:15,420
People getting knocked out
when they started spinning.

4423
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:15,811
Is that what,

4424
01:58:15,811 --> 01:58:16,260
what happened?

4425
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:16,551
No.

4426
01:58:16,551 --> 01:58:17,371
What did you see?

4427
01:58:17,371 --> 01:58:17,610
Um,

4428
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:19,160
the last glory you see Gloria,

4429
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:22,590
it's Nikki holds can
fought Raymond Daniels.

4430
01:58:22,591 --> 01:58:23,221
Raymond Daniels,

4431
01:58:23,221 --> 01:58:24,510
a famous point fighter.

4432
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,651
He's got wild,

4433
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:26,281
crazy kicks.

4434
01:58:26,281 --> 01:58:29,280
He's got one of the nuttiest
knockouts in all of kickboxing.

4435
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:31,070
He throws a jumping sidekick.

4436
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:32,670
You've seen me do it on a bag before.

4437
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:34,160
He just throws a jumping side,

4438
01:58:34,161 --> 01:58:34,501
kick,

4439
01:58:34,501 --> 01:58:36,330
touches the bag with one leg,

4440
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:40,230
then spins in mid air and spinning
back kicks the dude in the face.

4441
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:41,500
Who's crazy?

4442
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,041
That's crazy.

4443
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:42,590
You've seen it.

4444
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:44,110
Brenda was ridiculous.

4445
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:45,850
Raymond Daniels is a bad motherfucker.

4446
01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:48,070
See Nikki holds skin,

4447
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:49,360
swarmed him,

4448
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,740
got right in front of them.

4449
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:52,540
Power punches to the body,

4450
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:53,240
leg kick,

4451
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:56,650
leg kick back leg kick power punches
the body and just took them out.

4452
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:57,430
Just took them out.

4453
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,520
But basically get the base.

4454
01:58:58,521 --> 01:59:00,370
You have to basically
kept in his face too.

4455
01:59:00,371 --> 01:59:01,204
So the pressure,

4456
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,133
no room to spend.

4457
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,530
The one time that Raymond Daniels landed,

4458
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:05,200
he dropped him.

4459
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,760
He dropped holds can with a spinning
back kick butt holes and got back up.

4460
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:10,480
Smile and good fucking yeah,

4461
01:59:10,481 --> 01:59:11,650
it is ranked number one,

4462
01:59:11,651 --> 01:59:11,980
right?

4463
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:13,270
Holsteins number one and number one.

4464
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:13,830
Yeah,

4465
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:14,050
he's,

4466
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:14,230
he's,

4467
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:15,460
he's an ass straight bs.

4468
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,091
He's an animal.

4469
01:59:16,091 --> 01:59:17,080
He's not the champ though.

4470
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:18,640
Valtellina the other animal.

4471
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:20,230
Well him and vaults Illini fought.

4472
01:59:20,231 --> 01:59:22,900
It was a really good fight up to
the last round and he knocked belts,

4473
01:59:22,901 --> 01:59:23,950
Laney out faults.

4474
01:59:23,951 --> 01:59:26,230
Eleni was trying to come back and uh,

4475
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:27,430
trying to like trying to,

4476
01:59:27,431 --> 01:59:28,264
like,

4477
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:31,610
he was really being aggressive in the
final round and that's when a Holstein

4478
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:32,523
caught him.

4479
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:33,650
He's a Dick.

4480
01:59:33,650 --> 01:59:35,050
A student to Nikki.

4481
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:35,570
Yeah.

4482
01:59:35,570 --> 01:59:36,270
For him to go and go.

4483
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:36,790
Yeah.

4484
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:38,500
Is there any tie guys dedicated?

4485
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:38,981
Sorry,

4486
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:39,530
I'm sorry.

4487
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:40,340
I'm sorry.

4488
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:40,820
I was going to,

4489
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:43,360
I don't want to talk over you
didn't he dedicated his fight,

4490
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:44,050
his last fight.

4491
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:45,900
He's dedicated it to Ramona thing.

4492
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:47,120
I Raymond died if he easily could.

4493
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:47,590
Yeah.

4494
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:52,270
Maybe before then everyone they
indicated that they know is the cop.

4495
01:59:52,271 --> 01:59:53,470
They gave him some sort of a,

4496
01:59:53,471 --> 01:59:54,820
of some award.

4497
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,730
There was some sort of
a Ramon Dekkers thing,

4498
01:59:58,030 --> 01:59:59,400
but I don't know.

4499
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:00,683
Were you gonna say,

4500
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:04,841
I forget.

4501
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:06,070
I met God.

4502
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:07,780
You made me forget.

4503
02:00:07,781 --> 02:00:08,800
Sorry brother John.

4504
02:00:08,801 --> 02:00:09,850
In all your,

4505
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:10,970
your years have a,

4506
02:00:10,971 --> 02:00:11,830
especially in Australia,

4507
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:14,470
has anyone ever picked a fight
with you when you're out a night?

4508
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:15,041
Never.

4509
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:15,490
Right.

4510
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:16,323
They just know

4511
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:20,740
there's some people that attracted
I think because I'm so sort of just,

4512
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:20,921
hey,

4513
02:00:20,921 --> 02:00:22,030
you're going and smiling.

4514
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:24,810
I don't want to track a bad trouble,

4515
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:25,653
I guess.

4516
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:29,460
Otherwise they go out and they kind of
hope it never it every Sunday there you

4517
02:00:29,461 --> 02:00:30,920
get punched in and someone else say,

4518
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:32,260
but for myself,

4519
02:00:32,261 --> 02:00:32,740
I'd rather,

4520
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,930
I'd rather have the joke and boy it
would be it and trying to get in,

4521
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:35,950
cause you're not getting paid.

4522
02:00:35,951 --> 02:00:36,701
You're not getting famous.

4523
02:00:36,701 --> 02:00:37,534
You've got to jail.

4524
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:38,613
What the hell?

4525
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,930
No upside upside.

4526
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,860
Getting famous.

4527
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:45,550
Notice what he didn't say.

4528
02:00:45,551 --> 02:00:46,390
You're getting hurt.

4529
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,050
You're not getting famous.

4530
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:55,290
You're just fucking guys are a guys that
are famous for spa or there's gotta be

4531
02:00:58,061 --> 02:00:58,631
some wild,

4532
02:00:58,631 --> 02:00:59,830
unorthodox tie guys.

4533
02:00:59,831 --> 02:01:03,610
A few of them that are throwing a lot
of spinning crazy kicks that are not

4534
02:01:03,611 --> 02:01:04,120
traditional.

4535
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:04,750
It was a guy called,

4536
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:05,583
some of that comes in.

4537
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:08,890
He went in the first ever gold
medal in the Olympics for boxing.

4538
02:01:09,190 --> 02:01:10,120
And before he went to boxing,

4539
02:01:10,121 --> 02:01:12,640
he was a boy and he was a spinner.

4540
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:13,371
He'd spin the oboe.

4541
02:01:13,371 --> 02:01:13,901
He's been back.

4542
02:01:13,901 --> 02:01:14,950
He wasn't a very successful,

4543
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,600
he was assessed with the back elbows,

4544
02:01:16,601 --> 02:01:17,020
but they're,

4545
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:18,550
the backings of the ties was him coming.

4546
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:21,940
Just didn't keep them in the bomb and
push him over and teach them in the bum.

4547
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:22,180
Yeah,

4548
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:22,560
yeah,

4549
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:23,393
Frankie.

4550
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:24,130
Yeah.

4551
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:26,300
It just takes too long and just spin.

4552
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:27,580
Spin is just,

4553
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:28,670
you just see it common.

4554
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:28,961
You're like,

4555
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:29,300
wait,

4556
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:30,130
you got to spend.

4557
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:31,930
He was hands on how fast it wasn't.

4558
02:01:31,931 --> 02:01:33,990
It wasn't like a proper
taekwondo in Spain.

4559
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,110
It was a tight spin.

4560
02:01:35,111 --> 02:01:36,670
So is there a big difference?

4561
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:40,040
A lot of taekwondo spins or were
used as defense as are coming into

4562
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,033
and

4563
02:01:43,150 --> 02:01:44,900
your spin on Youtube and yours is insane.

4564
02:01:44,901 --> 02:01:45,591
So yeah,

4565
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:47,150
yours would be a lot
different to the ties,

4566
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:48,320
but if you saw Brian's,

4567
02:01:48,321 --> 02:01:49,410
you would agree with the ties.

4568
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:51,800
I was just saying that
shit ain't going to work.

4569
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:53,270
Hey,

4570
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:56,690
don't do that shit because on youtube
you guys and I was wearing a wig.

4571
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:00,030
I don't want to that style dude.

4572
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:01,250
You're seeing a lot of guys do.

4573
02:02:01,251 --> 02:02:02,360
Is that at that point styles?

4574
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,240
No power to it.

4575
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:04,103
That's the problem.

4576
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,080
So loose.

4577
02:02:06,450 --> 02:02:06,750
They,

4578
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:08,390
my nickname in MMA,

4579
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:11,520
they called me butter guys like him away.

4580
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:16,570
He hits the bag and he falls
away from it like of the bag.

4581
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:19,820
Faint forces his body away.

4582
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:21,020
I pulled my route balance,

4583
02:02:21,021 --> 02:02:21,711
same inbox in,

4584
02:02:21,711 --> 02:02:23,810
they'll right love those Olympic
guys who are gold medalists,

4585
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,400
they don't translate to the,

4586
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:29,540
to the pros because they have a kind of
a point scoring system and these pros

4587
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:30,240
are knocking mother.

4588
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:33,890
It's not going to do to all about
hitting the bag when it comes to kicking,

4589
02:02:33,891 --> 02:02:35,090
it's all about hitting the bag.

4590
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:38,330
All those karate guys that you see
throwing kicks in the air and they never

4591
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:39,173
heard anything.

4592
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:40,440
They never developed the,

4593
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:42,200
the ability to shift your weight.

4594
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:42,740
They're like,

4595
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:44,930
you know when he's throwing
a punch and you like,

4596
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,510
you know at the end of that punch,

4597
02:02:47,511 --> 02:02:48,170
you fucking,

4598
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:49,790
you're hitting things all the time.

4599
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:50,833
You're hitting me,

4600
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:52,130
you're hitting the bag.

4601
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:53,540
These guys are throwing kicks.

4602
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:54,680
They're not hitting anything.

4603
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:58,400
That's the number one problem with a lot
of these traditional martial artists.

4604
02:02:58,610 --> 02:02:59,180
They don't,

4605
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:00,260
they don't hit things.

4606
02:03:00,261 --> 02:03:00,560
You man,

4607
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,560
why he appointed me Bro.

4608
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:05,930
I had him kicked my bag and I lived.

4609
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:07,163
I almost,

4610
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:08,053
I almost cried.

4611
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:09,201
I fell over.

4612
02:03:09,201 --> 02:03:10,034
I fainted.

4613
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:11,600
I shut down.

4614
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,100
He's not allowed in there anymore,

4615
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:15,650
but he didn't grow up kicking things.

4616
02:03:15,651 --> 02:03:16,150
That's not true.

4617
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:19,700
He grew up in a terrible taekwondo
school that had him like throwing flippy

4618
02:03:19,701 --> 02:03:20,534
things in the air.

4619
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:24,590
It's not range a statement.

4620
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,511
Tell Him Brian.

4621
02:03:25,511 --> 02:03:26,660
I never saw him compete.

4622
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:27,823
I was competing.

4623
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:30,500
I have to find my library of video.

4624
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:32,810
I'll show you all my trophies.

4625
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:35,220
Well actually Chitchat.

4626
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:35,451
Keep.

4627
02:03:35,451 --> 02:03:36,830
I gave my truck to Chairman

4628
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:39,933
Mao,

4629
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:40,730
Bro.

4630
02:03:40,730 --> 02:03:44,380
I had the melted down when I
was traveling a local orphanage.

4631
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:45,800
We were basically,

4632
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,640
we were probably in the same wing classes,

4633
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:48,650
which is so confusing.

4634
02:03:48,651 --> 02:03:50,150
I traveled all over the world.

4635
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:51,133
Same Age,

4636
02:03:51,970 --> 02:03:53,000
same Aau,

4637
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:53,540
didn't you?

4638
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:55,120
I thought all style really?

4639
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:55,820
Cause I was fun.

4640
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:57,430
Merican taekwondo champion.

4641
02:03:57,950 --> 02:03:59,620
I wouldn't marry Ken Brown did that.

4642
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:00,950
I did the WTF.

4643
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:01,521
Dude.

4644
02:04:01,521 --> 02:04:02,450
I'm standing right here.

4645
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:07,060
I haven't strapper strap there.

4646
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:07,820
Never saw you.

4647
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:08,421
Never heard of.

4648
02:04:08,421 --> 02:04:09,130
You.

4649
02:04:09,130 --> 02:04:14,130
Never heard of you ever
heard [inaudible] level?

4650
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:15,450
Do you?

4651
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:15,630
Eddie,

4652
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,463
you.

4653
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,910
I would love to be very clear.

4654
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:23,120
I actually wouldn't lie about winning.

4655
02:04:23,121 --> 02:04:23,691
Just don't think you,

4656
02:04:23,691 --> 02:04:24,630
I think you did taekwondo.

4657
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:27,810
Don't think a blue belt or something at
the time when you were in the national

4658
02:04:27,811 --> 02:04:28,750
office about we be using now.

4659
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:30,980
You won the nationals as a black girl.

4660
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:31,820
I fought.

4661
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:34,310
I fought hard to believe the I in Iowa,

4662
02:04:34,311 --> 02:04:36,050
the American taekwondo championships.

4663
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:36,660
I'm sure you can look,

4664
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:37,493
this is so great.

4665
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:38,950
We're watching this fight.

4666
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:40,083
Your taekwondo,

4667
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:41,910
Michael Jackson.

4668
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:43,640
He's strong as your bride.

4669
02:04:43,970 --> 02:04:44,803
Oh,

4670
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:46,160
Michael Johnson's coming.

4671
02:04:46,161 --> 02:04:46,711
Was that he?

4672
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:47,170
Oh,

4673
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:47,530
Ooh.

4674
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:48,031
That test,

4675
02:04:48,031 --> 02:04:48,864
that Chen Dude,

4676
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:53,160
he's trying to stay tagged a few times
in the first round and Michael Johnson's

4677
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:54,600
putting the fucking scare on him.

4678
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:56,610
That was a hard left hand.

4679
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:57,850
Cause if you sit back yet,

4680
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:59,490
Barboza goes to town,

4681
02:04:59,491 --> 02:05:00,324
man

4682
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:05,460
Johnson with the heavy
shadow rapid both fast.

4683
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:05,821
This is,

4684
02:05:05,821 --> 02:05:07,220
this reminds me of the ways to find tech,

4685
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:08,100
but I created more.

4686
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:10,230
Nice shot you.

4687
02:05:10,231 --> 02:05:11,064
You don't know.

4688
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:12,870
When did you win with,

4689
02:05:12,871 --> 02:05:13,800
I don't understand.

4690
02:05:13,890 --> 02:05:14,490
Oh,

4691
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:16,410
you didn't hit him with
those double spinning.

4692
02:05:16,411 --> 02:05:18,190
A double spinning wheel kicked up fit.

4693
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:19,113
We'll kick.

4694
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:20,790
Oh Damn.

4695
02:05:20,791 --> 02:05:23,750
He's just stuff I used was
and get some volume young Jim,

4696
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:25,450
you can't set this pace for three rounds,

4697
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,293
so you can't,

4698
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,353
you can't.

4699
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:28,410
Yeah,

4700
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:29,940
but you've got a good point Brendan.

4701
02:05:29,941 --> 02:05:30,870
I mean they can't,

4702
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:33,630
he can't go at it 100% for three rounds.

4703
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:34,770
Oh,

4704
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,660
is Johnson coming off a loss?

4705
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:37,080
It,

4706
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:37,913
these last places,

4707
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:39,140
long layoff.

4708
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:39,630
Yeah.

4709
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:39,901
Yeah.

4710
02:05:39,901 --> 02:05:42,270
He had an injury is me.

4711
02:05:42,271 --> 02:05:42,810
Right.

4712
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:43,980
I don't remember what it was,

4713
02:05:43,981 --> 02:05:44,730
man.

4714
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:46,230
Didn't he lose the Tony Ferguson?

4715
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:47,093
I think he's lost.

4716
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:48,800
He beat Pete.

4717
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:49,380
Tony.

4718
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:50,290
He broke Tony's on.

4719
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:50,930
He,

4720
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:51,210
uh,

4721
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:52,250
he checked the kick,

4722
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:55,650
broke his forum for over a year.

4723
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:58,130
Didn't he'll write the steel plate.

4724
02:05:58,131 --> 02:05:58,330
It was,

4725
02:05:58,330 --> 02:05:59,260
he had a lot of problems with this.

4726
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:00,260
Put a steel plate in it.

4727
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:00,680
Yeah.

4728
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:01,381
There's a lot of problems.

4729
02:06:01,381 --> 02:06:03,720
Did he have the plate removed
or a d keep it in there?

4730
02:06:03,721 --> 02:06:04,890
I don't know what's going on with that,

4731
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:07,680
but he's back 100% more
ferocious than ever.

4732
02:06:07,730 --> 02:06:09,710
Our boats was mainly more,

4733
02:06:10,610 --> 02:06:11,010
yeah,

4734
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:13,260
that's a great reason
against Tony Ferguson.

4735
02:06:13,261 --> 02:06:14,094
That's a great fine.

4736
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:14,971
Okay.

4737
02:06:14,971 --> 02:06:16,770
That is great to be crazy.

4738
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,611
Tony's train,

4739
02:06:17,611 --> 02:06:18,660
so goddamn hard.

4740
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:19,500
Of course he is.

4741
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:20,310
He's an animal.

4742
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:21,001
I really loved that.

4743
02:06:21,001 --> 02:06:21,900
Able to Hilo fight,

4744
02:06:21,901 --> 02:06:23,210
that was a strong fight for him,

4745
02:06:23,211 --> 02:06:23,431
man.

4746
02:06:23,431 --> 02:06:24,780
It really showed us closure.

4747
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:25,260
Tamp.

4748
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:27,630
Michael Johnson's got
some fast fucking hands.

4749
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:29,570
He's really pressuring him,

4750
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:29,761
man.

4751
02:06:29,761 --> 02:06:30,690
I think it's so smart.

4752
02:06:30,691 --> 02:06:32,250
But the pace man for three rounds,

4753
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:36,330
he's the guy that in my opinion has
come up the most striking wise since he

4754
02:06:36,331 --> 02:06:37,470
joined the black zillions.

4755
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:39,450
If you watch him from the
ultimate fighter though,

4756
02:06:39,451 --> 02:06:40,500
the Michael Johnson,

4757
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:42,600
you see tag up Joe Lowe's on,

4758
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:44,790
he's just a different striker now.

4759
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:45,240
I agree.

4760
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:46,073
Hit him or Mitro.

4761
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:47,653
Barboza

4762
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:50,660
yeah,

4763
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:52,490
I'd say Johnson or mitre
and with the black tea,

4764
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:53,370
the trail.

4765
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:54,630
And it's come a long way as well.

4766
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,540
They have some rumble Johnson.

4767
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,021
Shit.

4768
02:06:58,021 --> 02:06:58,350
Fuck.

4769
02:06:58,350 --> 02:06:59,280
What are we talking about?

4770
02:06:59,281 --> 02:06:59,971
What are we talking about?

4771
02:06:59,971 --> 02:07:01,830
Robert Johnson's number one real quick.

4772
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:02,221
How about that?

4773
02:07:02,221 --> 02:07:03,900
Camps killing it and just say that.

4774
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:04,321
Well yeah,

4775
02:07:04,321 --> 02:07:06,000
right left by Johnson man.

4776
02:07:06,001 --> 02:07:07,800
That right hook tagged him on a tempo.

4777
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:09,230
He might be hurt.

4778
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:10,220
Blackzilians yeah,

4779
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:11,183
Richard Jones.

4780
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,241
Oh yeah.

4781
02:07:12,241 --> 02:07:13,000
Mytrials why?

4782
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,833
Shit?

4783
02:07:14,090 --> 02:07:14,430
Shit.

4784
02:07:14,430 --> 02:07:15,263
But he straight.

4785
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:18,493
No,

4786
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:19,530
he's straight.

4787
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:21,440
There's nothing about [inaudible] farm.

4788
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:23,730
He's more far more country,

4789
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:24,571
country,

4790
02:07:24,571 --> 02:07:25,404
strong,

4791
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:28,290
mature and I nine amateur and is down.

4792
02:07:28,330 --> 02:07:31,360
Well that's because he used to play
in the hand at whole nice leg kick.

4793
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:32,313
Oh,

4794
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:32,730
nice.

4795
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:37,730
Clean left hook by right
at Bondai of Barboza Talon

4796
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:40,760
kick you damn right Scott.

4797
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:42,250
He's cut his eyes,

4798
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:43,330
his eyes fucked up.

4799
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:47,790
Use that when he was coming in and see
that and when I say was pat kick is deep.

4800
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,110
Always write about thank you buddy.

4801
02:07:50,290 --> 02:07:50,711
It's like he,

4802
02:07:50,711 --> 02:07:52,090
it's like you are a national champ.

4803
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:56,380
Well I was even as a moist talking about
you can't not respect guys who are on

4804
02:07:56,381 --> 02:07:56,860
this hard.

4805
02:07:56,860 --> 02:07:57,720
This is,

4806
02:07:58,340 --> 02:07:59,680
you can't not take your eyes off it.

4807
02:07:59,681 --> 02:08:00,520
This is insane.

4808
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:02,231
When they let go.

4809
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:07,231
How do you prefer like watching Moitai
or do you prefer watching him in May now?

4810
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:08,403
MMA style.

4811
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:09,340
Really?

4812
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:10,180
Wow.

4813
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,073
Wow.

4814
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:11,591
I love,

4815
02:08:11,591 --> 02:08:12,424
I love butter.

4816
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,360
Left eyes cut now got cut in both eyes.

4817
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:16,901
That yeah,

4818
02:08:16,901 --> 02:08:18,890
that rat last right hook tag.

4819
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:20,260
No respect.

4820
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:22,210
Johnson's just no respect.

4821
02:08:22,290 --> 02:08:24,850
That's what Barboza has had
problems in the first round.

4822
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:25,271
I mean,

4823
02:08:25,271 --> 02:08:26,081
you think about it.

4824
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:28,450
That's where I'm the last call,

4825
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:30,580
Danny Castillo cracked
him in the first round.

4826
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:32,200
Had I'm really fucking hurt.

4827
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:33,041
Donaldson.

4828
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:34,240
Roni tagged with that Jab,

4829
02:08:34,241 --> 02:08:35,650
dropped him in the first round.

4830
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:36,340
Uh,

4831
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:37,770
Jamie Varner fucked him up.

4832
02:08:37,790 --> 02:08:38,441
That right hand.

4833
02:08:38,441 --> 02:08:39,400
If you're going to catch him,

4834
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,293
catch him with punches.

4835
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:42,940
He was all over Donald first round.

4836
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:44,950
All over in that jab dropped him.

4837
02:08:45,110 --> 02:08:45,943
Oh yeah.

4838
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:47,350
Donald dropped him and choked him.

4839
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:50,720
Is he still with you guys know if he's
still with Mark Henry just he'll leave.

4840
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:52,180
He does some work with them.

4841
02:08:52,181 --> 02:08:55,000
I know he was in one of
Franklin's last camps.

4842
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:56,591
Yeah,

4843
02:08:56,591 --> 02:08:57,070
cause mark,

4844
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:59,110
Henry's a straight fucking magician.

4845
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:00,490
He's a mastermind in the sport.

4846
02:09:00,491 --> 02:09:01,324
Doesn't get enough credit.

4847
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:01,960
You're right.

4848
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:04,610
Is this 55 holy shit.

4849
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,070
A big 55 man.

4850
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:06,580
They're going,

4851
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:09,960
what happens when these
guys fight Anthony Pettis?

4852
02:09:09,961 --> 02:09:10,320
Like what?

4853
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,280
Oh Pedis isn't sitting there.

4854
02:09:12,281 --> 02:09:14,170
Then you hit Panama's on another level.

4855
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:15,910
We're not both these guys out.

4856
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:17,200
He's on another level.

4857
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:17,690
Yeah,

4858
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:18,940
it seems like he is.

4859
02:09:18,941 --> 02:09:20,650
He's no wind up with power.

4860
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:21,670
He's got that shit.

4861
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:22,870
He's also his movement,

4862
02:09:22,871 --> 02:09:25,730
his liquor and a finish you in a sec.

4863
02:09:25,731 --> 02:09:29,680
He's fluid and he's a perfect example
of a guy who learned taekwondo first and

4864
02:09:29,681 --> 02:09:34,681
then went to a guy like Duke Roufus who
just is a Moitai encyclopedia who's also

4865
02:09:34,841 --> 02:09:38,560
been training MMA fighters for a long
fucking time and knows how to put it on

4866
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,180
his hand on cm punk.

4867
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,200
Have you heard some of the people,

4868
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:48,701
some of those fighters?

4869
02:09:48,701 --> 02:09:48,920
Man.

4870
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:49,241
Kelly,

4871
02:09:49,241 --> 02:09:50,074
could you beat?

4872
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:53,980
They still haven't decided who they're
going to give them the timeline either.

4873
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:55,330
I figured it out.

4874
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:57,010
He wants a timeline.

4875
02:09:57,011 --> 02:09:59,500
I think he wants her to learn
how to work really smart,

4876
02:09:59,560 --> 02:09:59,891
man.

4877
02:09:59,891 --> 02:10:02,080
I think what he's doing
is the right way to do it.

4878
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:02,591
Officially,

4879
02:10:02,591 --> 02:10:03,220
I don't even know.

4880
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:06,790
He's training with Duke until he's
ready to compete and he's saying,

4881
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:08,460
I'm not talking about
shit until just trying to,

4882
02:10:08,770 --> 02:10:13,510
that could be a couple of years I think
be after you get a couple of years.

4883
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:13,721
No,

4884
02:10:13,721 --> 02:10:13,981
UFC.

4885
02:10:13,981 --> 02:10:14,501
He's not like,

4886
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:14,711
yeah,

4887
02:10:14,711 --> 02:10:16,240
let's sign you and you'll
fight in three years.

4888
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:17,980
No son giving him six months.

4889
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:18,511
I don't know,

4890
02:10:18,511 --> 02:10:19,344
but

4891
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:21,370
they don't have a timeline.

4892
02:10:22,030 --> 02:10:22,170
The,

4893
02:10:22,170 --> 02:10:22,631
literally,

4894
02:10:22,631 --> 02:10:24,880
he said he wants to make
a big deal out of it.

4895
02:10:24,881 --> 02:10:25,151
You know,

4896
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:29,590
they did this little announcement and
he said he wants to train until he's

4897
02:10:29,591 --> 02:10:30,250
ready.

4898
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:31,210
That's not three years.

4899
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:33,620
I guarantee you the UFC
is gonna be three years.

4900
02:10:33,621 --> 02:10:34,454
Do what?

4901
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,713
Here's a fight.

4902
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:36,441
Oh Shit.

4903
02:10:36,441 --> 02:10:37,280
Eric Soda.

4904
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:38,173
Rashad Evans.

4905
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:40,090
Somebody's not,

4906
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:44,930
obviously that's an a month going Paris,

4907
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:46,310
Hong Kong with a real name.

4908
02:10:46,311 --> 02:10:47,870
I mean a guy with no long time.

4909
02:10:47,871 --> 02:10:48,021
No,

4910
02:10:48,021 --> 02:10:51,020
they're going to pair a cm punk up with
a guy who should never be in the UFC.

4911
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:52,551
I'm not,

4912
02:10:52,551 --> 02:10:53,750
shouldn't be in the UFC.

4913
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:55,280
I mean it shouldn't be in the UFC yet.

4914
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:56,870
I bet you know the guy with like one.

4915
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:57,980
Oh you think?

4916
02:10:58,430 --> 02:11:01,160
I bet they give him like a old
washed up guy who's been in the UFC,

4917
02:11:01,161 --> 02:11:02,820
so we recognize the navy out of bed.

4918
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:03,950
Everything owned right now.

4919
02:11:03,951 --> 02:11:06,290
And it was in the cm
punk versus fallen Fox.

4920
02:11:06,350 --> 02:11:07,183
Who would you bet on?

4921
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:10,080
Everything you own right now?

4922
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:13,040
Sam punk over Fallen Fox.

4923
02:11:13,041 --> 02:11:13,874
Yes.

4924
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:14,870
Destroying class.

4925
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:15,590
Yeah.

4926
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:16,150
Okay.

4927
02:11:16,150 --> 02:11:16,590
Okay.

4928
02:11:16,590 --> 02:11:16,761
I,

4929
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:16,940
Hey,

4930
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:18,720
I would've picked a Sam punk too.

4931
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:21,831
Damn.

4932
02:11:21,831 --> 02:11:23,820
Michael Johnson is still going
hard in this second round.

4933
02:11:23,821 --> 02:11:24,770
Two massive man,

4934
02:11:24,890 --> 02:11:25,161
man.

4935
02:11:25,161 --> 02:11:25,994
He looks good.

4936
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,541
Yeah,

4937
02:11:26,541 --> 02:11:26,871
he's not,

4938
02:11:26,871 --> 02:11:28,850
it doesn't have a strategic
approach to this fight at all.

4939
02:11:28,851 --> 02:11:30,800
He's just trying to test Barboza.

4940
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:32,090
I think it's smart man.

4941
02:11:32,091 --> 02:11:33,020
Trying to break his will.

4942
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:34,780
I like it and he's,

4943
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:35,710
he's already kept it.

4944
02:11:35,711 --> 02:11:39,440
Light kicks away because Barboza has
been real careful about those counters.

4945
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:42,980
He's hesitant landing
nearly as many leg kicks is.

4946
02:11:42,981 --> 02:11:46,670
He has some really smart man and
a South Pole to south park too.

4947
02:11:48,230 --> 02:11:52,520
Do you like when when you see south paws
and MMA and it opens up that inside leg

4948
02:11:52,521 --> 02:11:52,880
kick?

4949
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,713
Yes.

4950
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:54,381
Yeah.

4951
02:11:54,381 --> 02:11:56,020
Got to stay really basic
when you're putting this up.

4952
02:11:56,021 --> 02:11:56,600
Well yeah,

4953
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,021
he's right.

4954
02:11:57,021 --> 02:11:57,920
Kicks in the right hands,

4955
02:11:57,921 --> 02:11:58,754
right hand left hooks.

4956
02:11:59,150 --> 02:12:01,330
You can't do the flashy stuff
against says [inaudible].

4957
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:06,300
It doesn't work really I believe saying
no one you have of the Orthodox fighting

4958
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:08,550
the south part opens up
the back leg power kicked.

4959
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:08,871
Oh right.

4960
02:12:08,871 --> 02:12:10,100
Because it's that soft side.

4961
02:12:10,101 --> 02:12:10,570
Yeah,

4962
02:12:10,570 --> 02:12:11,480
set it to the back.

4963
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:12,380
But you can't,

4964
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,230
you can't rely on you.

4965
02:12:13,231 --> 02:12:13,621
Sweet.

4966
02:12:13,621 --> 02:12:15,350
You can't use your front
teeth as much anymore.

4967
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:17,050
It's taken away a little weapons.

4968
02:12:17,110 --> 02:12:19,000
Who good body kick capture most body.

4969
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:21,290
Why can't do damn he heard
him with that left hand.

4970
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:22,520
Why can't you use the uh,

4971
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:23,880
the front teeth this month?

4972
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:26,020
Oh,

4973
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:26,811
oh.

4974
02:12:26,811 --> 02:12:30,350
Sitting down those punches that
was taking the shine nasty.

4975
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:31,310
Oh Damn.

4976
02:12:31,311 --> 02:12:32,420
That was a quick switch.

4977
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:36,740
If Johnson slows down Barboza and start
letting loose and letting loose of those

4978
02:12:36,741 --> 02:12:38,510
kicks because he good late in the fight.

4979
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:40,510
Proposer Cardio.

4980
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:44,450
It's better be better of Cardio
Frankie Edgar and for the record,

4981
02:12:44,451 --> 02:12:48,980
cm punk would kick my motherfucking line
had fallen thought if it went to the

4982
02:12:48,981 --> 02:12:49,814
ground,

4983
02:12:49,890 --> 02:12:52,430
don't get twist and I don't know
that there's punches involved.

4984
02:12:52,431 --> 02:12:54,650
Anything can happen and
we are the on the record.

4985
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:58,340
Cm punk would fuck me up and he's got
way bigger balls than me for stepping in

4986
02:12:58,341 --> 02:12:58,671
the cage.

4987
02:12:58,671 --> 02:12:59,360
If it's what I did.

4988
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:00,870
I was just doing jokes on stage.

4989
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:02,610
Big Guy.

4990
02:13:02,610 --> 02:13:04,500
False humility is hurting my feelings.

4991
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:04,870
Slash.

4992
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:05,480
Mom.

4993
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:05,680
No,

4994
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:06,470
no,

4995
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:06,591
no,

4996
02:13:06,591 --> 02:13:06,711
no,

4997
02:13:06,711 --> 02:13:06,861
no.

4998
02:13:06,861 --> 02:13:08,390
I'm not saying that's not being humble.

4999
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:09,560
If I bought cm punk,

5000
02:13:09,561 --> 02:13:10,394
he fucked me up.

5001
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:12,150
Listen to pro wrestling.

5002
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:14,541
He got me.

5003
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:15,230
Fuck yeah,

5004
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:15,800
man.

5005
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:16,221
Dude,

5006
02:13:16,221 --> 02:13:16,760
I might even,

5007
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:17,820
I might even fucking with you.

5008
02:13:17,821 --> 02:13:18,020
I'm,

5009
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:18,590
that was me.

5010
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:18,801
No,

5011
02:13:18,801 --> 02:13:19,581
I'm serious.

5012
02:13:19,581 --> 02:13:20,414
That was,

5013
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,700
oh,

5014
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:24,020
Jackson got tagged.

5015
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,131
He got tagged,

5016
02:13:25,131 --> 02:13:25,371
Dude.

5017
02:13:25,371 --> 02:13:26,780
Barbosa just clean.

5018
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:26,931
Oh,

5019
02:13:26,931 --> 02:13:27,621
there's Mark Henry.

5020
02:13:27,621 --> 02:13:28,454
He's in his corner.

5021
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:29,960
That was a clean right hand.

5022
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:30,531
Yeah.

5023
02:13:30,531 --> 02:13:30,761
You're,

5024
02:13:30,761 --> 02:13:31,800
you're going to be in trouble.

5025
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:32,790
Uh,

5026
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:33,541
you're going to get tagged.

5027
02:13:33,541 --> 02:13:33,691
Right.

5028
02:13:33,691 --> 02:13:35,370
You open yourself up
being this aggressive.

5029
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:36,390
Just a matter of time.

5030
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:37,950
He definitely got tagged right there.

5031
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:40,190
It's also a matter of a Barbosa Campbell,

5032
02:13:40,230 --> 02:13:40,621
the weather,

5033
02:13:40,621 --> 02:13:41,111
the store.

5034
02:13:41,111 --> 02:13:41,820
I agree.

5035
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:42,571
Oh,

5036
02:13:42,571 --> 02:13:43,650
Johnson tag him.

5037
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:43,981
Ooh.

5038
02:13:43,981 --> 02:13:44,814
Little wobble.

5039
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:46,020
His legs are a little shaky.

5040
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:46,770
Ooh.

5041
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:47,960
He's trying to take him down.

5042
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,290
Fucking old down.

5043
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:51,190
Just that hour.

5044
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:52,410
Thrown against the cage.

5045
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:55,230
Some big heaving breaths here,

5046
02:13:55,231 --> 02:13:56,064
folks.

5047
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:58,140
I think he was rocked there.

5048
02:13:58,170 --> 02:13:58,830
Yeah,

5049
02:13:58,830 --> 02:13:59,640
no doubt.

5050
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:00,121
Oh my God.

5051
02:14:00,121 --> 02:14:00,750
He's on his back.

5052
02:14:00,750 --> 02:14:01,583
He's not good.

5053
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:05,190
It's not good for eds
and Blacktown Jujitsu.

5054
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:05,980
I don't know,

5055
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:06,813
man.

5056
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:09,240
I don't remember right now.

5057
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:11,850
I don't think so either.

5058
02:14:11,950 --> 02:14:12,421
A black guy,

5059
02:14:12,421 --> 02:14:13,420
I don't think exact belts.

5060
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:17,913
If you're,

5061
02:14:18,010 --> 02:14:19,390
if you're an aggressive guy,

5062
02:14:19,391 --> 02:14:22,410
landing your cardio last longer
than aggressive guy ever losing,

5063
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:22,850
uh,

5064
02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:23,200
not,

5065
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:23,981
not leaning as much.

5066
02:14:23,981 --> 02:14:24,641
If you keep leaning,

5067
02:14:24,641 --> 02:14:25,180
all of a sudden you,

5068
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:25,600
I got him,

5069
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:25,991
I got him,

5070
02:14:25,991 --> 02:14:26,351
I got him.

5071
02:14:26,351 --> 02:14:26,701
He can kiss,

5072
02:14:26,701 --> 02:14:28,540
keep pump coming the
rounds at all the time,

5073
02:14:28,541 --> 02:14:29,150
but as soon as you start,

5074
02:14:29,150 --> 02:14:30,780
lose the confidence gives you care.

5075
02:14:30,781 --> 02:14:32,140
As soon as she was just
not missing anything.

5076
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:32,711
Oh Shit.

5077
02:14:32,711 --> 02:14:33,544
I'm tired.

5078
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:36,250
But why Atlanta every
time you rock him too.

5079
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:37,313
It's a purple belt.

5080
02:14:38,700 --> 02:14:40,660
Really pro Bono Jujitsu.

5081
02:14:41,690 --> 02:14:44,590
He works with Ricardo Almeida
down there in New Jersey.

5082
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:51,340
He's looking for that cake man
who set up that head kicks.

5083
02:14:55,950 --> 02:14:57,180
Oh Dang.

5084
02:14:57,181 --> 02:14:58,710
Johnson's just common man.

5085
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:00,960
Johnson's wearing the same John,

5086
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:01,960
how come you,

5087
02:15:01,961 --> 02:15:06,360
you never saw Superman is oh damn.

5088
02:15:06,361 --> 02:15:08,160
That was a nice right hand too.

5089
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:11,250
How come he never saw superman
punches in Moitai very,

5090
02:15:11,251 --> 02:15:12,084
very rarely.

5091
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,680
But you see it so much in MMA.

5092
02:15:13,681 --> 02:15:14,191
What is that?

5093
02:15:14,191 --> 02:15:15,060
I think the little gloves,

5094
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,830
the little gloves make
a hell of a difference.

5095
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:17,521
Even,

5096
02:15:17,521 --> 02:15:18,240
even George,

5097
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:19,150
when George Tourism,

5098
02:15:19,190 --> 02:15:20,460
they seems the rock guys heads back.

5099
02:15:20,461 --> 02:15:22,290
But you do that in 10 ounce
gloves and nothing happens.

5100
02:15:22,291 --> 02:15:23,000
It's like boom,

5101
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:23,480
all right.

5102
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:24,090
Right.

5103
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:24,770
It was funny.

5104
02:15:24,770 --> 02:15:25,350
What do you,

5105
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:26,310
but you do an MMA gloves.

5106
02:15:26,311 --> 02:15:28,760
All of a sudden it's just
rock your world and George,

5107
02:15:28,761 --> 02:15:29,820
that was off his jab too,

5108
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:31,320
which is not a hard punch.

5109
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:32,670
You're saying it's just kind of flashy,

5110
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:34,260
frozen.

5111
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:35,910
Not going to be a difficult Johnson.

5112
02:15:35,911 --> 02:15:36,290
Don't call him.

5113
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:38,250
I ain't even know who you're watching.

5114
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:39,810
So ugly.

5115
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:40,230
Michael,

5116
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:41,063
Michael,

5117
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:43,410
Mj,

5118
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:46,050
Mj come in and you get to leg kicks from.

5119
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:47,433
Yeah,

5120
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:48,310
the number two,

5121
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:49,980
Dan,

5122
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:51,360
I just leaned into leg kicks.

5123
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:52,293
Just say you guys know

5124
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:54,663
when I trained,

5125
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:55,471
when I trained,

5126
02:15:55,471 --> 02:15:57,270
just like fighting it in the Philippines.

5127
02:15:58,850 --> 02:15:59,640
The Philippines.

5128
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:00,180
Yeah.

5129
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:03,890
I was at a third place where
your national champ fell.

5130
02:16:03,891 --> 02:16:04,540
That took place.

5131
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:05,131
Took third place.

5132
02:16:05,131 --> 02:16:05,830
I had the virus,

5133
02:16:05,830 --> 02:16:06,570
had a,

5134
02:16:06,570 --> 02:16:07,403
I had a virus,

5135
02:16:08,210 --> 02:16:09,090
I had the runs.

5136
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:13,280
So you're not buying this national
champs stuff with [inaudible] hit thing.

5137
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,760
Let's not get carried
away with national chain.

5138
02:16:15,761 --> 02:16:16,770
That's what you told me.

5139
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:17,250
There was a,

5140
02:16:17,250 --> 02:16:21,900
there was nothing called the nationals
in Iowa in 1987 I can't remember exactly

5141
02:16:21,901 --> 02:16:22,734
where I'll find out.

5142
02:16:23,070 --> 02:16:23,970
I can actually find out.

5143
02:16:23,971 --> 02:16:24,450
Watch this.

5144
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:24,641
Wow.

5145
02:16:24,641 --> 02:16:24,990
Hold on.

5146
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:25,741
I'm going to find out.

5147
02:16:25,741 --> 02:16:26,970
I'll get you all the details.

5148
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:27,771
I asked her,

5149
02:16:27,771 --> 02:16:30,250
I go to Twitter universe
to pictures of Callen

5150
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:31,031
when and no one.

5151
02:16:31,031 --> 02:16:31,270
Right?

5152
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:32,050
Nothing.

5153
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:35,470
I'll get all of it just doesn't make
any sense that everyone that I knew from

5154
02:16:35,471 --> 02:16:37,630
back then doesn't know
you have you either.

5155
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:39,730
Well because they're all stupid.

5156
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:43,810
What was going on?

5157
02:16:43,811 --> 02:16:44,510
I don't understand.

5158
02:16:44,510 --> 02:16:45,343
I'm to ask.

5159
02:16:46,530 --> 02:16:48,460
It was the 80s it was the late eighties.

5160
02:16:48,461 --> 02:16:49,630
We didn't have fucking made that.

5161
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:50,560
No one's storage shit.

5162
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:51,430
What was the,

5163
02:16:51,610 --> 02:16:52,443
I believe it,

5164
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:54,220
it's just like what did you guys kick?

5165
02:16:54,221 --> 02:16:57,150
Did you just kick paddles or banana trees?

5166
02:16:58,140 --> 02:16:58,891
No bags.

5167
02:16:58,891 --> 02:16:59,950
And who did you fight back?

5168
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:01,593
Do you have a name?

5169
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:02,920
Um,

5170
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:05,620
cause I remember everyone I
five thought rich spelling.

5171
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:07,160
I don't remember that.

5172
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:12,520
I know the last guy following him asking
me out and I know the guy I fought

5173
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:13,810
beforehand cause I knocked him out.

5174
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:16,630
But I know it's like a shit load of guys.

5175
02:17:16,631 --> 02:17:16,841
Right?

5176
02:17:16,841 --> 02:17:18,010
Like you're competing all the time.

5177
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:18,821
The last year or two,

5178
02:17:18,821 --> 02:17:19,600
I don't remember.

5179
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:20,321
I don't remember it.

5180
02:17:20,321 --> 02:17:21,040
You get two fights.

5181
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,600
I remember Jack Mcvicker.

5182
02:17:22,820 --> 02:17:23,490
That's it.

5183
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:23,860
Great.

5184
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:26,050
And this fucking fight is crazy.

5185
02:17:26,051 --> 02:17:27,070
Jesus Christ.

5186
02:17:27,310 --> 02:17:28,270
Even a third round.

5187
02:17:28,271 --> 02:17:29,890
These guys are throwing man.

5188
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:31,840
Oh there you went for it.

5189
02:17:31,841 --> 02:17:32,481
See any slips.

5190
02:17:32,481 --> 02:17:33,640
See I told him he shouldn't do that.

5191
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:38,170
Damn he is throwing some fast kicks.

5192
02:17:38,171 --> 02:17:41,500
I think they are both
Barboza he's down to,

5193
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:45,490
there was a four header
so we'll see what he says.

5194
02:17:45,491 --> 02:17:45,950
Okay,

5195
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:46,783
well let's wait.

5196
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:49,330
Would you say that uh,

5197
02:17:49,390 --> 02:17:51,100
Michael Johnson Kin,

5198
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:51,934
uh,

5199
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:55,390
can throw more kicks because he
doesn't throw that many right?

5200
02:17:55,450 --> 02:17:55,730
Oh,

5201
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:56,311
those are nice ones.

5202
02:17:56,311 --> 02:17:56,890
They bought in.

5203
02:17:56,890 --> 02:17:57,281
I'm sorry,

5204
02:17:57,281 --> 02:17:57,551
John,

5205
02:17:57,551 --> 02:17:58,510
I asked you a question.

5206
02:17:58,511 --> 02:17:59,380
I think we cut you off.

5207
02:17:59,381 --> 02:18:00,040
Like why?

5208
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:01,090
What about the front leg?

5209
02:18:01,091 --> 02:18:03,750
Tepe what about the southpaw
stance takes away the teeth.

5210
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:07,000
If you all are standing Orthodox and
you've got your left leg forward and then

5211
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,070
your orthodox,

5212
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:09,960
the left leg is going to go through it.

5213
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:10,480
The center.

5214
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:11,570
As soon as you going to set up,

5215
02:18:11,571 --> 02:18:13,380
all of a sudden this leg is
going to check it and you can,

5216
02:18:13,510 --> 02:18:16,630
you can check your stomach
because your stomach a lot easier.

5217
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,850
So now everything's got to be off
the right leg and said the front leg.

5218
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:19,983
You know what I mean?

5219
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,010
Atlanta flashy.

5220
02:18:22,010 --> 02:18:24,370
But as soon as I saying he and then all
of a sudden I've got this like neon.

5221
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:25,840
Right.

5222
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:26,673
I see what you're saying.

5223
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:28,770
Do you find that typically a midway?

5224
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:30,370
I had 72 and a half.

5225
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:34,090
And what do you walk around
at 80 e five 86 oh Geez.

5226
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:35,490
Yeah.

5227
02:18:35,490 --> 02:18:37,350
So in 40 [inaudible] you,

5228
02:18:37,351 --> 02:18:37,600
you,

5229
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:39,840
you cut weight that just like a MMA.

5230
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:42,480
Then I start 10 weeks
out and so they go down.

5231
02:18:42,481 --> 02:18:44,940
So they go down and then lose
probably the last five or six.

5232
02:18:44,941 --> 02:18:45,900
Jesus Christ,

5233
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:46,850
this is our job.

5234
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:48,461
This is a war.

5235
02:18:48,461 --> 02:18:49,740
I mean these guys are not fighting.

5236
02:18:49,741 --> 02:18:50,640
They're trying to kill each other.

5237
02:18:50,641 --> 02:18:52,590
This is a Johnson set,

5238
02:18:52,591 --> 02:18:53,790
a very aggressive pace.

5239
02:18:54,550 --> 02:18:55,920
It's still keeping it up.

5240
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:57,161
Yeah.

5241
02:18:57,161 --> 02:19:00,880
It's almost like he's trying to prove
a point or make a big statement.

5242
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:02,800
That was a big kick to
the body right there.

5243
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:03,933
Who's winning so far?

5244
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:04,630
How are those cases?

5245
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:06,520
The body Johnson's not to not scored.

5246
02:19:07,490 --> 02:19:09,610
Same as punching you.

5247
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:14,010
You really think Johnson up in that
second round and I wasn't paying enough

5248
02:19:14,011 --> 02:19:16,590
attention when he talks to my two
zero and he got that take down.

5249
02:19:17,070 --> 02:19:17,903
That's right.

5250
02:19:18,210 --> 02:19:19,230
We are in Brazil though.

5251
02:19:19,530 --> 02:19:20,190
Yeah,

5252
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:21,570
and he did rock Johnson.

5253
02:19:21,571 --> 02:19:22,470
Would that one punch?

5254
02:19:23,490 --> 02:19:24,650
Johnson rock case control.

5255
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:27,800
He's pushing easily be Brazilian easily.

5256
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:31,060
Oh Dang.

5257
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:34,820
That was a beautiful combination
to Johnson is on fire.

5258
02:19:34,860 --> 02:19:35,571
Oh Damn.

5259
02:19:35,571 --> 02:19:38,960
So good kick to the body that he's trying
to finish out of blood coming out of

5260
02:19:38,961 --> 02:19:39,260
the nose.

5261
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:40,190
Over both a cam.

5262
02:19:40,191 --> 02:19:41,120
That's a hard kick.

5263
02:19:41,121 --> 02:19:43,110
How's he taking that rose?

5264
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:44,780
That kicks so fast,

5265
02:19:44,781 --> 02:19:45,320
man.

5266
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:47,120
There's so little windup.

5267
02:19:48,350 --> 02:19:49,580
Oh that's another thing John.

5268
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:51,110
Like what do you think about like,

5269
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:55,460
like a lot of these guys you've seen in
MMA like Liardo they throw karate style

5270
02:19:55,461 --> 02:19:56,330
where there's no warm,

5271
02:19:56,390 --> 02:19:57,920
there's no step is no.

5272
02:19:57,921 --> 02:19:58,131
Like,

5273
02:19:58,131 --> 02:19:58,401
what do you,

5274
02:19:58,401 --> 02:20:02,750
what do you think about the varying
differences between like the karate style

5275
02:20:02,751 --> 02:20:06,170
that you're starting to see from a
lot of these guys and like Thai style?

5276
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:07,580
I'm loving it.

5277
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:08,870
I love the variables,

5278
02:20:08,871 --> 02:20:10,000
the versatility I like.

5279
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:11,210
I love having,

5280
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:11,680
um,

5281
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:14,510
the culture of karate coming back again
and all of a sudden it's showing that it

5282
02:20:14,511 --> 02:20:16,340
is an actual form and
he's actually working.

5283
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:18,800
I don't want to be a one person.

5284
02:20:18,850 --> 02:20:19,321
I'm only toy.

5285
02:20:19,321 --> 02:20:21,770
He's going to beat everything I like.

5286
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:22,851
I like karate.

5287
02:20:22,851 --> 02:20:22,911
I,

5288
02:20:22,911 --> 02:20:23,500
let's see,

5289
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:24,333
I like MMA.

5290
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:25,360
Awesome.

5291
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:26,193
Awesome.

5292
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:27,041
If you can throw a,

5293
02:20:27,041 --> 02:20:28,160
an amazing spin kick,

5294
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:31,160
I reckon it's amazing
instead of the traditional,

5295
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:32,280
yeah,

5296
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:33,420
if you can do the cool stuff a

5297
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:35,953
couple of way.

5298
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:40,100
Well you know that opened minded probably
one of the reasons why you became a

5299
02:20:40,101 --> 02:20:41,180
great fighter in the first place.

5300
02:20:41,181 --> 02:20:42,014
You were thinking,

5301
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:42,380
you know,

5302
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:43,213
Oh damn.

5303
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:46,130
Barboza has some really
fucking fast kicks man.

5304
02:20:46,131 --> 02:20:46,964
Super fast.

5305
02:20:46,970 --> 02:20:48,080
Like from the chamber,

5306
02:20:48,081 --> 02:20:50,420
like right from the launch,

5307
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:52,160
he's throwing some,

5308
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:56,570
not really land in Johnson's very
aware and ready pressure man pressures.

5309
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:57,230
Incredible.

5310
02:20:57,230 --> 02:21:00,680
And the ones that have landed Johnson's
eating them well and countering,

5311
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:01,613
Ooh,

5312
02:21:01,650 --> 02:21:02,950
take some crazy shots.

5313
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:10,510
This just shows you like how high level
MMA as these guys have dedicated like

5314
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:13,670
their heart and soul for
years to get to this point.

5315
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,980
And both of them would get lit up.

5316
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:16,970
But Cardio,

5317
02:21:19,130 --> 02:21:21,580
is there anyone take down attempt
as well as the whole fight is?

5318
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:23,660
It's pretty much pretty much um,

5319
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:24,590
mostly stand up.

5320
02:21:24,591 --> 02:21:24,980
Yeah.

5321
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:25,880
You're seeing that a lot,

5322
02:21:25,881 --> 02:21:26,480
man.

5323
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:27,350
You're seeing that a lot.

5324
02:21:27,351 --> 02:21:27,861
There's many,

5325
02:21:27,861 --> 02:21:29,090
many fights ago by now.

5326
02:21:29,091 --> 02:21:32,310
It used to be very unusual if there
was no grappling at all in a fight.

5327
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:33,320
Now it's pretty common.

5328
02:21:33,830 --> 02:21:34,490
Uh,

5329
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:38,570
I think that's because of the pressure
from the fancy takes him down.

5330
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:39,800
I think it's a number of things.

5331
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:41,660
I think that's a number of things though.

5332
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:43,340
If you,

5333
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:44,180
if you're a grappler,

5334
02:21:44,181 --> 02:21:46,700
it's frowned upon John's Kallan
was he kicking around this?

5335
02:21:46,701 --> 02:21:47,534
Right?

5336
02:21:47,930 --> 02:21:48,830
I would agree.

5337
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:54,820
But as that master wheel kicker was kind
of in a national national championships

5338
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:56,743
national,

5339
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:57,920
I mean it was kind of a national,

5340
02:21:57,921 --> 02:21:58,431
we can't just,

5341
02:21:58,431 --> 02:22:00,050
if you read the tech one of the times,

5342
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:00,920
cause that,

5343
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:01,551
and if you do,

5344
02:22:01,551 --> 02:22:02,384
you're a loser

5345
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,520
Johnson one that Johnson won that fight.

5346
02:22:07,870 --> 02:22:08,391
Definitely.

5347
02:22:08,391 --> 02:22:09,170
Definitely.

5348
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:09,951
At least two or three.

5349
02:22:09,951 --> 02:22:10,670
Nothing really.

5350
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:11,540
I think three nothing,

5351
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:12,650
but it's Brazil.

5352
02:22:12,650 --> 02:22:14,840
It might be a very impressive performance.

5353
02:22:14,841 --> 02:22:16,880
I'll tell you that he went after Chad.

5354
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:20,450
Some of my hardest fights
have been doing the cutter.

5355
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:22,543
Is that right?

5356
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:28,690
Is anyone taking myself?

5357
02:22:29,230 --> 02:22:30,810
So that's not as very personal.

5358
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:33,180
Okay.

5359
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:34,410
So what took that seriously?

5360
02:22:34,411 --> 02:22:35,101
What can I ask you this?

5361
02:22:35,101 --> 02:22:37,890
Do you ever use Open Eagle Claw here?

5362
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:38,940
Look at that right there.

5363
02:22:38,941 --> 02:22:39,990
I did the Mac.

5364
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,850
What do you guys think about the,

5365
02:22:41,851 --> 02:22:42,031
uh,

5366
02:22:42,031 --> 02:22:43,020
the main event here?

5367
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:44,180
Frank Mir and big foot.

5368
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:47,640
I think when there's only one
guy needs to win more than I do.

5369
02:22:47,641 --> 02:22:48,460
It's Frank Mir.

5370
02:22:48,460 --> 02:22:49,520
Big Foot needs a win too.

5371
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:50,430
He just got knocked out by her.

5372
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:51,840
Lawsky here's my question.

5373
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:54,150
Should be allowed to do in Brazil.

5374
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:54,920
No,

5375
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:56,310
both foot lost a cane.

5376
02:22:56,350 --> 02:22:57,183
Right?

5377
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:58,290
He lost a cane.

5378
02:22:58,410 --> 02:22:59,930
He had a draw,

5379
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:01,270
but then they took it away.

5380
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:01,891
Tested,

5381
02:23:01,891 --> 02:23:03,940
positive sounding,

5382
02:23:03,980 --> 02:23:05,160
been tested positive.

5383
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:07,800
He had a license to take testosterone.

5384
02:23:07,801 --> 02:23:09,420
They tested him before the fight.

5385
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,590
He was one level.

5386
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:12,330
They tested them after the fight.

5387
02:23:12,450 --> 02:23:13,500
He was off the charts.

5388
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:15,300
So that means in the locker room,

5389
02:23:15,301 --> 02:23:18,240
hang it hat pride styles.

5390
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:20,840
He's getting sued by
his doctor because he's,

5391
02:23:20,930 --> 02:23:24,210
he tried to say that this was the
doctor's fault that was doctor suing him.

5392
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:25,320
So,

5393
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:26,190
so he's really,

5394
02:23:26,191 --> 02:23:27,240
Oh and three mirrors.

5395
02:23:27,241 --> 02:23:27,601
Owen?

5396
02:23:27,601 --> 02:23:28,710
Four oh five.

5397
02:23:28,711 --> 02:23:30,450
Oh and for uh,

5398
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:30,781
you know,

5399
02:23:30,781 --> 02:23:34,050
I don't think you'd say he's so in three
after that fight with big foot or with

5400
02:23:34,051 --> 02:23:36,210
a Mark Hunt rather cause all due respect.

5401
02:23:36,530 --> 02:23:37,130
That was amazing.

5402
02:23:37,130 --> 02:23:38,430
It was such a fucking war.

5403
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:38,791
Yeah.

5404
02:23:38,791 --> 02:23:40,770
Maybe he was on some chemical assistance,

5405
02:23:41,130 --> 02:23:42,060
but God damn,

5406
02:23:42,061 --> 02:23:43,320
that was a fucking war for sure.

5407
02:23:43,321 --> 02:23:44,190
But it wasn't a win.

5408
02:23:44,191 --> 02:23:44,970
So I would say,

5409
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:45,690
oh in two.

5410
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:46,261
Yeah,

5411
02:23:46,261 --> 02:23:46,890
two and one.

5412
02:23:46,890 --> 02:23:49,690
I'm going to say it's so
fucking hard to tell him it's,

5413
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,250
what do you,

5414
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:51,083
what do you call that?

5415
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:54,450
You either gotta say the fight never
happened or you say was what it was,

5416
02:23:54,451 --> 02:23:55,380
which was a draw.

5417
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:56,250
I don't think we sang it.

5418
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:57,961
You celebrate it.

5419
02:23:57,961 --> 02:23:58,470
Celebrate it.

5420
02:23:58,470 --> 02:23:59,010
You can't sell it.

5421
02:23:59,010 --> 02:24:02,190
Well you could celebrate it as a
performance though cause got down.

5422
02:24:02,191 --> 02:24:03,720
That was a performance by both guys.

5423
02:24:03,721 --> 02:24:04,620
So much so that I have a,

5424
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:05,910
I have a roots of fight,

5425
02:24:05,911 --> 02:24:07,080
a very limited edition,

5426
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:09,840
big foot hunt silver
tube before the drugs,

5427
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:13,440
the drug test came back,

5428
02:24:13,441 --> 02:24:14,400
came out classic.

5429
02:24:14,401 --> 02:24:17,260
They made this jacket
and Dana sent me one.

5430
02:24:17,290 --> 02:24:18,830
We were laughing and he
gave it to me cause he,

5431
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:19,920
he loved that fight.

5432
02:24:19,921 --> 02:24:20,850
Taina love that fight.

5433
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:24,420
And then when it turned out they got the
drug test back and they found out that

5434
02:24:24,421 --> 02:24:25,500
big foot was through the roof.

5435
02:24:25,530 --> 02:24:26,700
It was so disappointed.

5436
02:24:27,150 --> 02:24:28,380
He was just so depressed.

5437
02:24:28,710 --> 02:24:29,810
He had these jackets.

5438
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:31,020
It the classic.

5439
02:24:31,021 --> 02:24:31,321
Yeah,

5440
02:24:31,321 --> 02:24:33,600
it was a jazz make foot hunt too.

5441
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:34,970
I was ringside

5442
02:24:36,630 --> 02:24:37,560
medio away from it.

5443
02:24:37,970 --> 02:24:38,803
Oh,

5444
02:24:39,460 --> 02:24:41,220
steroid problem and kickboxing.

5445
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:42,920
Did we talk?

5446
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:43,753
We didn't test.

5447
02:24:44,070 --> 02:24:48,720
But in Thailand that's not a
problem then you've got a problem.

5448
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:49,530
No.

5449
02:24:49,530 --> 02:24:52,350
Then you don't have a problem
because you're not really caring.

5450
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:55,760
I would say it's an issue you say.

5451
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:57,060
Would you say in your opinion,

5452
02:24:57,530 --> 02:24:58,363
uh,

5453
02:24:58,590 --> 02:24:59,160
what,

5454
02:24:59,160 --> 02:24:59,993
what do you think?

5455
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,030
Let's say pride or the pride
biters and all the pride fights.

5456
02:25:03,031 --> 02:25:08,031
Would you say the number would be 70% of
pride fighters were on something 80 90

5457
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:10,470
or a hundred what would you say?

5458
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:11,100
What would you say it?

5459
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:13,020
I can't say I did a pri back then.

5460
02:25:13,021 --> 02:25:16,140
I don't know if you had to guess based
on the things you hear when I talk to

5461
02:25:16,141 --> 02:25:16,921
ensign anyway,

5462
02:25:16,921 --> 02:25:18,840
who fought in pride and didn't do shit,

5463
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:19,920
he didn't take anything.

5464
02:25:20,220 --> 02:25:21,120
Have you talked to him?

5465
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:21,990
I bet.

5466
02:25:21,990 --> 02:25:24,190
I bet he's right and most people,

5467
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:28,900
so probably most seen means like
70 60 70 something like that.

5468
02:25:28,901 --> 02:25:31,990
But he said it was in the contract
that they don't test for steroids.

5469
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:34,060
They wrote it down in the contract.

5470
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:34,780
It's weird.

5471
02:25:34,780 --> 02:25:38,740
I think MONTCO was a prime example of
someone that might've done something

5472
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:43,490
to dissolve my nose.

5473
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:44,920
All positive thinking.

5474
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:47,040
Mark [inaudible].

5475
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:48,370
I dunno about Kirk.

5476
02:25:48,371 --> 02:25:49,210
If he woulda did stories,

5477
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:50,073
he would have been huge.

5478
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:52,840
Same with Ken shamrock.

5479
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,753
Mark Coleman.

5480
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:56,073
Yeah.

5481
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:58,260
So,

5482
02:25:58,260 --> 02:26:01,810
so the reality is the reality,

5483
02:26:01,811 --> 02:26:02,800
as we know,

5484
02:26:02,980 --> 02:26:06,010
probably pretty certain if you had a bet,

5485
02:26:06,011 --> 02:26:06,581
all the money you had,

5486
02:26:06,581 --> 02:26:06,941
you would go,

5487
02:26:06,941 --> 02:26:07,451
yeah.

5488
02:26:07,451 --> 02:26:08,710
Most of the pride fighters,

5489
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:12,190
maybe 90% maybe you'd
have to go with that.

5490
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:15,940
And no one's questioning
their legacies exactly at all.

5491
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:16,151
No,

5492
02:26:16,151 --> 02:26:16,540
it's quick.

5493
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:17,950
And we know they were,

5494
02:26:18,250 --> 02:26:18,971
they promoted it,

5495
02:26:18,971 --> 02:26:19,920
they put it in their contract,

5496
02:26:19,930 --> 02:26:21,050
but it does.

5497
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:22,450
No one tested positive.

5498
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:23,920
Once people test positive,

5499
02:26:23,921 --> 02:26:24,880
then people get angry,

5500
02:26:24,881 --> 02:26:26,050
then the trolls come out.

5501
02:26:26,051 --> 02:26:27,430
Then people share their opinions.

5502
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:31,510
Then people write all these fucking
pieces about it and then then it becomes

5503
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,230
like,

5504
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:33,250
it becomes a real thing.

5505
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:36,700
Nerds that sucked at sports
that are talking shit.

5506
02:26:36,850 --> 02:26:37,241
No,

5507
02:26:37,241 --> 02:26:38,590
it's a lot of people that are like,

5508
02:26:38,591 --> 02:26:38,861
you know,

5509
02:26:38,861 --> 02:26:39,790
they're purists.

5510
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:41,110
They don't want to see that shit,

5511
02:26:41,140 --> 02:26:43,210
but it's always been in,

5512
02:26:43,211 --> 02:26:44,410
in every major sport.

5513
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:47,340
We're pretending that
it's not around sports.

5514
02:26:47,350 --> 02:26:49,300
Going to be more accepting of it.

5515
02:26:49,301 --> 02:26:49,871
Like you're gonna be like,

5516
02:26:49,871 --> 02:26:50,010
Hey,

5517
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:50,771
the guys on shit,

5518
02:26:50,771 --> 02:26:50,991
whatever.

5519
02:26:50,991 --> 02:26:52,000
He's still a great athlete.

5520
02:26:52,070 --> 02:26:54,850
If you've never compete in sports and
you stick behind a computer and eat

5521
02:26:54,851 --> 02:26:55,684
Cheetos all day,

5522
02:26:55,690 --> 02:26:55,991
you're like,

5523
02:26:55,991 --> 02:26:57,160
this is ridiculous.

5524
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:58,780
That's why they're better than me.

5525
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:01,900
It could have been the NFL
if I did the same shit.

5526
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:02,321
Oh really?

5527
02:27:02,321 --> 02:27:03,850
Go take the same shit and
trying to get baseball.

5528
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:04,280
Like baby.

5529
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:05,113
Yes.

5530
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:07,450
Everyone's pretending,

5531
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:08,170
right?

5532
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:08,380
Yeah.

5533
02:27:08,380 --> 02:27:08,940
There's a lot of,

5534
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:09,640
that's what's going on.

5535
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,510
Everyone's gone.

5536
02:27:10,840 --> 02:27:11,171
Okay,

5537
02:27:11,171 --> 02:27:12,540
let's pretend test.

5538
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:14,620
We're going to have a
pretend press conference.

5539
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:18,010
We're going to have a pretend
news fucking media thing.

5540
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:22,030
Everything's pretend
testing is fucking for real.

5541
02:27:22,031 --> 02:27:23,320
They're spending a shitload of money.

5542
02:27:23,330 --> 02:27:24,131
The conferences,

5543
02:27:24,131 --> 02:27:25,060
the press conferences,

5544
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:29,050
but everybody that's testing
everybody's involved.

5545
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:30,280
They know the reality.

5546
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:34,000
The testing is just to somehow
make it look like they care.

5547
02:27:34,330 --> 02:27:35,163
No,

5548
02:27:35,290 --> 02:27:35,680
no.

5549
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:37,570
The testing is to try to eliminate it.

5550
02:27:37,571 --> 02:27:41,170
The trusting is try to bus people and now
they're going to give them huge fines.

5551
02:27:41,171 --> 02:27:43,030
Now they're going to kick
them out for like two years,

5552
02:27:43,031 --> 02:27:43,930
two or four years.

5553
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:44,231
Right.

5554
02:27:44,231 --> 02:27:44,891
Like Dana said,

5555
02:27:44,891 --> 02:27:47,050
I want my four years and let's make man,

5556
02:27:47,051 --> 02:27:48,400
I don't know about any of that.

5557
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:50,200
That's what they're doing,

5558
02:27:50,230 --> 02:27:51,120
but nothing's,

5559
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:54,070
because I hear they have to kind of
do it and have to kind of say it.

5560
02:27:54,090 --> 02:27:54,380
They have to.

5561
02:27:54,380 --> 02:27:55,091
They have to do.

5562
02:27:55,091 --> 02:27:56,260
Everybody want to do it.

5563
02:27:56,261 --> 02:27:57,520
They want to clean up the sport.

5564
02:27:57,521 --> 02:27:58,840
I know this from the top down.

5565
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:02,530
They do want to get the steroids at a
sport because it's bad for their business.

5566
02:28:02,910 --> 02:28:06,730
If these guys can get tested positive
for steroids and it keeps showing up and

5567
02:28:06,731 --> 02:28:07,360
all these new,

5568
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:11,080
it becomes a part of the store that
makes it unattractive to advertisers and

5569
02:28:11,081 --> 02:28:13,960
makes it look like what
the worst stereotype is.

5570
02:28:14,170 --> 02:28:19,060
This thuggish sport that's filled with
criminals and people doing unethical

5571
02:28:19,061 --> 02:28:22,700
things and the Lance Armstrong
and and all that Barry bonds,

5572
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:24,410
yet everyone's still doing more cycling.

5573
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:25,970
Everyone's still doing it right,

5574
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:27,770
but that's what they're
trying to eliminate.

5575
02:28:27,771 --> 02:28:30,140
How else would you have him
eliminated with random testing?

5576
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:33,870
The time to catch then
everybody isn't there.

5577
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:37,820
What do you send that Victor content but
wasn't he saying when he said that they

5578
02:28:37,821 --> 02:28:40,700
got steroids now that get out of your
system really quick and that's what

5579
02:28:40,701 --> 02:28:44,510
everyone's really on is the shit that
gets out of your system within days.

5580
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,490
And they're just taking
chavy Lance Armstrong.

5581
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:48,370
He just said like on,

5582
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:49,490
isn't that what he's saying?

5583
02:28:49,491 --> 02:28:51,410
And His podcast or maybe I heard wrong,

5584
02:28:51,411 --> 02:28:54,340
but apparently podcast with me.

5585
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:58,370
I don't know if it was yours over it
again and listen cause we talked about a

5586
02:28:58,371 --> 02:28:59,470
lot of parents.

5587
02:28:59,510 --> 02:29:00,231
Have you heard of this?

5588
02:29:00,231 --> 02:29:02,630
Have you heard that there's like steroids,

5589
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:05,180
they get in and out of
your system really quick,

5590
02:29:05,181 --> 02:29:05,710
right?

5591
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:06,370
Yeah,

5592
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:06,680
right.

5593
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:08,660
But I don't think financially guys,

5594
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:10,630
a lot of guys in the UFC
and beat afford those.

5595
02:29:10,631 --> 02:29:13,490
That's like at a high level you're talking
about Lance Armstrong talking about

5596
02:29:13,491 --> 02:29:14,680
NFL guys probably deal.

5597
02:29:14,690 --> 02:29:15,101
So there's,

5598
02:29:15,101 --> 02:29:18,950
there are different steroids and get
out of your system really quick that are

5599
02:29:18,951 --> 02:29:19,850
super expensive.

5600
02:29:20,230 --> 02:29:21,350
That's what I've heard like,

5601
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:23,620
but yeah,

5602
02:29:23,621 --> 02:29:26,870
like there's steroids that
they're ahead of the testing.

5603
02:29:27,070 --> 02:29:27,210
Well,

5604
02:29:27,210 --> 02:29:31,340
you know when I feel like he was a guy
that would know because he was a part of

5605
02:29:31,341 --> 02:29:32,720
that whole thing with the clean,

5606
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:33,711
they would put that,

5607
02:29:33,711 --> 02:29:34,450
that would,

5608
02:29:34,450 --> 02:29:37,580
it's like a gel they would put
on these guys and they would,

5609
02:29:37,690 --> 02:29:41,870
they would pass all their tests and that's
what's what the balco scandal was all

5610
02:29:41,871 --> 02:29:42,170
about.

5611
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:44,130
Was it designer steroids
that they create it.

5612
02:29:44,330 --> 02:29:45,650
So if that's what he's saying,

5613
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:47,280
I mean that makes sense that this,

5614
02:29:47,890 --> 02:29:49,010
you know what's going to eliminate it?

5615
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,780
The UFC doing random testing.

5616
02:29:50,781 --> 02:29:52,330
He's going to fuck guys Brendan.

5617
02:29:52,331 --> 02:29:52,550
But,

5618
02:29:52,550 --> 02:29:52,941
but listen,

5619
02:29:52,941 --> 02:29:53,780
it's great what they're doing.

5620
02:29:53,781 --> 02:29:54,440
They still,

5621
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:55,490
in your opinion,

5622
02:29:55,491 --> 02:29:58,100
do you think professional
football players,

5623
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:58,790
uh,

5624
02:29:58,790 --> 02:30:01,580
do steroids don't eat into the microphone.

5625
02:30:02,210 --> 02:30:05,060
You think they do social
after all this shit,

5626
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:09,590
you still have professional athletes
still doing it after all the time.

5627
02:30:09,591 --> 02:30:10,770
He's going to be a part of cycling.

5628
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:11,510
Are they still doing it?

5629
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:12,230
100%.

5630
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:14,240
So how are they going
to clean it up in MMA?

5631
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:18,860
Technology's going to just
possible technologies is
always going to be ahead of

5632
02:30:18,861 --> 02:30:19,340
the testing.

5633
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:20,600
I wouldn't say it's impossible,

5634
02:30:20,601 --> 02:30:21,800
but you can catch guys.

5635
02:30:21,801 --> 02:30:22,634
What are these?

5636
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:23,900
I think they're,

5637
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:25,010
I think it's,

5638
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:25,391
I think,

5639
02:30:25,391 --> 02:30:25,651
I think,

5640
02:30:25,651 --> 02:30:27,010
I don't think anybody should be trying.

5641
02:30:27,030 --> 02:30:27,950
I think it's just a show.

5642
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:28,251
But,

5643
02:30:28,251 --> 02:30:29,840
but now is it a show Eddie?

5644
02:30:29,841 --> 02:30:31,270
Cause now if you get caught dancing,

5645
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:32,510
you're out two to four years.

5646
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:34,360
If you're a uh,

5647
02:30:34,430 --> 02:30:37,490
Roy Nelson or Brendan Schaub and they
tell you out for two or four years,

5648
02:30:37,580 --> 02:30:38,260
you're done.

5649
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:39,290
You're done fighting.

5650
02:30:39,350 --> 02:30:40,910
So are you going to risk taking steroids?

5651
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:42,440
The,

5652
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:43,380
if you know your,

5653
02:30:43,490 --> 02:30:45,710
he's the harshest laws
and professional sports,

5654
02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:49,640
that's what they're trying to get done
as that what's going on at that point?

5655
02:30:49,641 --> 02:30:50,250
How can,

5656
02:30:50,250 --> 02:30:51,770
how come I never got to
that point in football,

5657
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:52,753
they're still in it.

5658
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:57,710
A true [inaudible] doesn't have a
state athletic commission behind him.

5659
02:30:57,711 --> 02:30:58,400
Like Nevada.

5660
02:30:58,400 --> 02:30:59,233
Is that what's going on?

5661
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:00,130
Absolutely.

5662
02:31:00,130 --> 02:31:02,180
100% so football doesn't have a state.

5663
02:31:02,210 --> 02:31:05,420
I don't have to have a state
athletic commission or fights.

5664
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:06,950
They self test.

5665
02:31:07,070 --> 02:31:07,571
They like to,

5666
02:31:07,571 --> 02:31:10,190
why the NFL or the NBA
doesn't test for pot.

5667
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:12,260
They may make it in their contracts.

5668
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:12,900
It's,

5669
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:14,010
you don't have to deal with the athletics.

5670
02:31:14,310 --> 02:31:16,430
They figured out a way to get around it.

5671
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:17,780
No sports,

5672
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:19,140
they don't have anybody to answer to.

5673
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:20,130
Well they didn't have anybody

5674
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:20,761
to answer to that.

5675
02:31:20,761 --> 02:31:21,121
You didn't.

5676
02:31:21,121 --> 02:31:25,110
Nevada state athletic
commission sanctioned to UFC
to make it legitimate cause

5677
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:28,620
have was this crazy sport
that was actually outlawed.

5678
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,480
Football's never outlawed.

5679
02:31:30,690 --> 02:31:35,310
So football didn't need to be cleaned
up to the point of where some regulatory

5680
02:31:35,311 --> 02:31:38,580
body consents to having
them performing their state.

5681
02:31:38,610 --> 02:31:40,350
Also [inaudible] NFL,

5682
02:31:40,351 --> 02:31:42,810
those guys aren't punching and
kicking each other in the face.

5683
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:43,853
So there's a little bit,

5684
02:31:44,250 --> 02:31:47,400
there should be stricter punishment
when it comes to fighting until you're

5685
02:31:47,401 --> 02:31:49,420
getting into punching
and kicking in the face.

5686
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:50,490
And I got it.

5687
02:31:50,810 --> 02:31:53,970
I didn't sign up for extra
punching hard in the face.

5688
02:31:53,971 --> 02:31:56,070
I signed up for medium punching.

5689
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:58,410
I didn't want to get punched really hard.

5690
02:31:58,650 --> 02:31:59,550
It doesn't make any sense.

5691
02:31:59,551 --> 02:32:01,110
You're getting in a fight in the cage.

5692
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:02,610
You guys are throwing down.

5693
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:06,210
I Dunno.

5694
02:32:06,210 --> 02:32:07,170
I'm not sure what you're saying.

5695
02:32:07,410 --> 02:32:09,300
I'm just saying that I
think it's a big show.

5696
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:11,250
I mean everybody knows
everyone's doing shit.

5697
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:13,140
You're saying they shouldn't
do anything about it.

5698
02:32:13,490 --> 02:32:17,190
I'm saying all I'm saying they
should if it worked for pride,

5699
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:17,930
let them do.

5700
02:32:17,930 --> 02:32:19,440
I'm saying they have pride rules,

5701
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:20,400
pride format,

5702
02:32:20,490 --> 02:32:21,120
pride.

5703
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:22,200
A pride regulation.

5704
02:32:22,201 --> 02:32:22,771
That's what I'm saying.

5705
02:32:22,771 --> 02:32:23,970
I think that that's bad for the sport.

5706
02:32:24,510 --> 02:32:25,450
Was it bad for prime?

5707
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:26,250
It did.

5708
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:27,083
Did Pride

5709
02:32:30,130 --> 02:32:30,840
advertisements.

5710
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:31,051
Yeah.

5711
02:32:31,051 --> 02:32:31,321
Pride.

5712
02:32:31,321 --> 02:32:34,290
One under dodge and Harley
Davidson jumping on board,

5713
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:39,720
but did it have to do with the steroid
use the steroids made pride crumble.

5714
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:41,580
I'm sure it was a part of it.

5715
02:32:41,581 --> 02:32:43,290
You can't have guys Jerusalem the Gills,

5716
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:44,580
but how did that have to,

5717
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:48,300
how did that correlate
with the demise of pride?

5718
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:49,340
I don't get it.

5719
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:51,750
Cause guys have traps hanging
out of their fucking airs,

5720
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:52,800
punch each other lives,

5721
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:54,030
so hardly dance like,

5722
02:32:54,031 --> 02:32:54,160
yeah.

5723
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:55,390
Obviously that guy's not natural.

5724
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:57,240
I don't know.

5725
02:32:57,240 --> 02:33:00,870
This is a false premise was what
happened with pride was the Yakuza.

5726
02:33:01,230 --> 02:33:01,831
That's what happened.

5727
02:33:01,831 --> 02:33:02,760
There's a lot of problems.

5728
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,713
First of all,

5729
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:06,840
Japanese are different than
us and they go in fads,

5730
02:33:06,841 --> 02:33:10,410
they have fans and sometimes
those fads are gigantic.

5731
02:33:10,411 --> 02:33:11,370
Huge things like,

5732
02:33:11,371 --> 02:33:11,611
you know,

5733
02:33:11,611 --> 02:33:11,841
the,

5734
02:33:11,841 --> 02:33:12,120
the,

5735
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:15,150
they would fill 90,000 seat
arenas with kickboxing.

5736
02:33:15,570 --> 02:33:16,110
Not Anymore,

5737
02:33:16,110 --> 02:33:16,740
man.

5738
02:33:16,740 --> 02:33:17,240
Really?

5739
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:17,510
Yeah.

5740
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:19,110
And just things happen.

5741
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:19,973
Things change.

5742
02:33:20,010 --> 02:33:20,843
Yeah.

5743
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:21,540
Nope.

5744
02:33:21,540 --> 02:33:21,811
Nope.

5745
02:33:21,811 --> 02:33:23,250
Not until the mic and see how I do that.

5746
02:33:24,580 --> 02:33:25,413
People complained about,

5747
02:33:26,180 --> 02:33:29,790
well what about I promise
I'll never do that again.

5748
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:30,893
Back to him.

5749
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:32,281
That's a probably.

5750
02:33:32,281 --> 02:33:33,000
What about,

5751
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,800
what about Fidor do you
reckon he was on something?

5752
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:36,270
Um,

5753
02:33:36,270 --> 02:33:36,751
you know what,

5754
02:33:36,751 --> 02:33:39,660
until you know for sure you can't say,

5755
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:40,773
you know,

5756
02:33:40,980 --> 02:33:43,800
but I would imagine the
possibility is high.

5757
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:44,401
He didn't look,

5758
02:33:44,401 --> 02:33:45,181
cause he didn't fuck,

5759
02:33:45,181 --> 02:33:46,014
he didn't,

5760
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:50,520
he looked big fucking making me go back
and look at what he looked like when he

5761
02:33:50,521 --> 02:33:52,770
fought Fujita go back and
look at what he looked like.

5762
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:54,480
It was a thick motherfucker.

5763
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:57,240
He didn't look anything like you
looked when he fought big foot.

5764
02:33:57,241 --> 02:33:58,620
Sova so what happened?

5765
02:33:58,770 --> 02:33:59,880
Did he stop lifting weights?

5766
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:00,810
That's possible.

5767
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:04,110
Or did he stop taking whatever
the fuck he was tanking?

5768
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:05,220
That's possible too.

5769
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:05,460
Yeah.

5770
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:07,140
When Anderson Silva test positive,

5771
02:34:07,290 --> 02:34:08,160
I would have never guessed.

5772
02:34:08,161 --> 02:34:08,911
I know what it never,

5773
02:34:08,911 --> 02:34:09,320
I would talk.

5774
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:09,450
I,

5775
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:11,190
I w I l everyone apology.

5776
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:14,310
I told people John Fitch
would never take steroids

5777
02:34:15,810 --> 02:34:17,770
because John Fisch told
me that and I believed him

5778
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:22,020
in your late thirties you're
trying to compete in MMA with the,

5779
02:34:22,050 --> 02:34:23,920
I mean it's almost impossible.

5780
02:34:25,110 --> 02:34:26,530
Not only even know it ain't easy.

5781
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:27,490
Well,

5782
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:31,030
would you rate Fidor even better than
he already is for beating guys at are on

5783
02:34:31,031 --> 02:34:31,864
steroids?

5784
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:33,161
Yes.

5785
02:34:33,161 --> 02:34:35,800
Unless he was on steroids when
you guys were on steroids,

5786
02:34:36,180 --> 02:34:36,520
you don't,

5787
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:37,301
you don't know man.

5788
02:34:37,301 --> 02:34:37,900
Look,

5789
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:42,900
he's obviously in the pocket of some
very wealthy people who would want him to

5790
02:34:43,511 --> 02:34:45,730
do well at all costs.

5791
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:49,270
I don't know what the ramifications
of those conversations,

5792
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:55,020
but I do know that I had
heard unsubstantiated reports
of how he got paid and

5793
02:34:55,340 --> 02:34:58,270
who got the actual money and you know,

5794
02:34:58,271 --> 02:35:00,430
he's dealing with some very
fucking powerful people.

5795
02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:02,270
It went big when paintings at the show,

5796
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:03,041
there's something going on.

5797
02:35:03,041 --> 02:35:05,980
There's a lot of other people behind
the show that also were very wealthy and

5798
02:35:05,981 --> 02:35:06,550
you know,

5799
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:07,440
look there's there,

5800
02:35:07,441 --> 02:35:10,840
there he is right there fader that fade
or with big foot on top of him smashing

5801
02:35:10,841 --> 02:35:12,150
them as no,

5802
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:15,130
no relationship whatsoever
to the fade or that beat.

5803
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:16,780
So many guys in pride.

5804
02:35:16,781 --> 02:35:17,770
He's also older though.

5805
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:21,790
It is kind of personnel there
might had his exemption.

5806
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:22,150
Yup.

5807
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:23,650
He did have his exemption.

5808
02:35:23,651 --> 02:35:24,820
He was huge back then.

5809
02:35:24,970 --> 02:35:25,520
He is all,

5810
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:26,680
all those things are correct.

5811
02:35:26,681 --> 02:35:27,490
You're right.

5812
02:35:27,490 --> 02:35:32,490
But I still and mean he was certainly
diminished because of just sheer training.

5813
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:34,120
Trauma fights,

5814
02:35:34,210 --> 02:35:37,930
some high level fights against
some big guys for a long career.

5815
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:38,890
There was all that too.

5816
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:40,870
I leave and changed his style of,

5817
02:35:41,010 --> 02:35:41,910
of training through.

5818
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:43,390
He stopped with the weight lift.

5819
02:35:43,391 --> 02:35:45,430
I don't think sometimes
guys just getting old,

5820
02:35:45,431 --> 02:35:46,570
they might not be on steroids.

5821
02:35:46,571 --> 02:35:48,550
Just get old washed up.

5822
02:35:48,820 --> 02:35:49,660
That shit happens.

5823
02:35:49,661 --> 02:35:50,650
We get punched in the face.

5824
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:53,781
That definitely happened.

5825
02:35:53,781 --> 02:35:54,614
Yeah.

5826
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:56,771
Can we go,

5827
02:35:56,771 --> 02:35:57,630
do you guys think Frank Mir,

5828
02:35:57,640 --> 02:35:58,473
big foot,

5829
02:35:58,930 --> 02:35:59,763
big foot.

5830
02:36:00,190 --> 02:36:01,180
I've got to go with Frank Mir.

5831
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:04,650
I didn't like the way big foot went
down against our Lawsky looked.

5832
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,650
We looked crazy.

5833
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:06,590
It looked like his,

5834
02:36:06,590 --> 02:36:07,810
his chin had evaporated.

5835
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:09,340
Also taken frank man.

5836
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:10,293
Surprisingly.

5837
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:11,260
Yeah.

5838
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:12,370
You're going Frank Mir from Joe.

5839
02:36:12,970 --> 02:36:13,990
Not For me.

5840
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:14,883
For Frank.

5841
02:36:14,950 --> 02:36:15,061
No,

5842
02:36:15,061 --> 02:36:16,590
I'm saying you're going with,

5843
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:16,901
yeah,

5844
02:36:16,901 --> 02:36:17,734
I'm going with mirror.

5845
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:19,270
I think miracle win this fight,

5846
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:23,430
but I wouldn't be surprised if big
foot took it to him by submission.

5847
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:24,363
Oh,

5848
02:36:24,850 --> 02:36:28,900
he could win by submission because big
foot's never been submitted and he's a

5849
02:36:28,901 --> 02:36:30,370
black belt while he's giant.

5850
02:36:30,730 --> 02:36:31,330
I know.

5851
02:36:31,330 --> 02:36:33,580
Do you see one fader and went
for that leg lock on his laugh?

5852
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:34,241
He was like,

5853
02:36:34,241 --> 02:36:34,600
yeah.

5854
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:34,871
I was like,

5855
02:36:34,871 --> 02:36:35,261
Damn.

5856
02:36:35,261 --> 02:36:36,340
So no,

5857
02:36:36,470 --> 02:36:36,860
no,

5858
02:36:36,860 --> 02:36:38,860
no laughing door.

5859
02:36:39,570 --> 02:36:40,840
I would just want to see frank wind.

5860
02:36:40,841 --> 02:36:41,674
Man,

5861
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:43,690
he looks in good shape.

5862
02:36:43,810 --> 02:36:44,111
I mean,

5863
02:36:44,111 --> 02:36:45,760
I watch some footage of him training.

5864
02:36:45,790 --> 02:36:46,091
He'll say,

5865
02:36:46,091 --> 02:36:47,170
you worked hard for this.

5866
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:49,980
He had Vicki Lynn down on
his corner and did a lot of,

5867
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:50,980
a lot of training with him.

5868
02:36:51,370 --> 02:36:52,530
A lot of work on his grappling.

5869
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:00,700
Fucking hard man.

5870
02:37:00,701 --> 02:37:01,534
At this age,

5871
02:37:02,170 --> 02:37:02,770
it's hard.

5872
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:04,600
You gotta realize frank was 22,

5873
02:37:04,601 --> 02:37:06,940
he's been fighting the
UFC isn't tired life.

5874
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:07,893
Yeah,

5875
02:37:07,990 --> 02:37:08,201
dude,

5876
02:37:08,201 --> 02:37:09,550
I was there back then watching it.

5877
02:37:10,510 --> 02:37:10,691
I mean,

5878
02:37:10,691 --> 02:37:12,820
I didn't get a chance to see
the early ones in person.

5879
02:37:12,850 --> 02:37:14,320
I didn't get a chance
to see him in person.

5880
02:37:14,321 --> 02:37:16,430
And like until

5881
02:37:16,430 --> 02:37:17,480
a boy,

5882
02:37:17,481 --> 02:37:18,860
I remember which fight it was.

5883
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:20,810
Lessons maybe.

5884
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:21,021
Well,

5885
02:37:21,021 --> 02:37:21,854
I saw,

5886
02:37:22,310 --> 02:37:23,690
I saw west Sam's for sure.

5887
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:24,530
Um,

5888
02:37:24,530 --> 02:37:25,520
I saw the,

5889
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:26,690
the uh,

5890
02:37:26,690 --> 02:37:27,620
Tim Silvia fight.

5891
02:37:27,650 --> 02:37:28,520
I was there for that,

5892
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:32,960
talking to Tim in the octagon and we
wanted to keep fighting and then we showed

5893
02:37:32,961 --> 02:37:33,510
them the video,

5894
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:34,460
his arm getting snapped.

5895
02:37:34,490 --> 02:37:34,850
He's like,

5896
02:37:34,850 --> 02:37:35,181
oh,

5897
02:37:35,181 --> 02:37:35,960
and then you realize like,

5898
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:36,650
oh,

5899
02:37:36,650 --> 02:37:38,190
and then the shock sets and you're like,

5900
02:37:38,220 --> 02:37:39,110
I gotta get to the hospital.

5901
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:39,500
He thought,

5902
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:40,640
Oh yeah,

5903
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:42,710
yeah.

5904
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:45,680
I just appreciate what frank stands
for and how long he's been doing it.

5905
02:37:45,681 --> 02:37:46,520
And he's relevant.

5906
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:50,330
And my favorite UFC fight of all
times when he beat Brock Lesner,

5907
02:37:50,390 --> 02:37:55,160
I felt like it was the MMA
community against the WWE
community when he beat him.

5908
02:37:55,161 --> 02:37:57,050
I never chaired for so
and so hard in my life.

5909
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:57,950
But how crazy is it?

5910
02:37:57,951 --> 02:38:00,380
Take a guy his second pro fight,

5911
02:38:00,650 --> 02:38:03,920
you make them fight a former
UFC champion in his prime.

5912
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:04,670
Great.

5913
02:38:04,670 --> 02:38:05,301
Ridiculous,

5914
02:38:05,301 --> 02:38:06,134
ridiculous.

5915
02:38:06,380 --> 02:38:06,650
Well,

5916
02:38:06,650 --> 02:38:10,760
Brock Lesnar got brought along worse
than any fucking fighter ever in the

5917
02:38:10,761 --> 02:38:14,660
history of fighting and still
managed to outrun the odds.

5918
02:38:14,810 --> 02:38:16,680
I still managed to speak of a freak.

5919
02:38:16,681 --> 02:38:17,120
He was,

5920
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:17,690
oh yeah.

5921
02:38:17,690 --> 02:38:18,201
Beat Randy.

5922
02:38:18,201 --> 02:38:20,150
Go towards fourth fucking pro fight.

5923
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:20,811
How?

5924
02:38:20,811 --> 02:38:21,630
What?

5925
02:38:21,630 --> 02:38:22,463
Ha.

5926
02:38:22,630 --> 02:38:24,650
[inaudible] knocked him out.

5927
02:38:24,890 --> 02:38:28,670
Beat heath herring and then he beats
Randy coture third and fourth profile.

5928
02:38:28,700 --> 02:38:29,810
Are you fucking kidding me?

5929
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,070
He gets submitted by frank,

5930
02:38:31,071 --> 02:38:31,281
right?

5931
02:38:31,281 --> 02:38:31,550
Yeah.

5932
02:38:31,550 --> 02:38:33,380
Well the second fight with frank.

5933
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:34,280
Yes.

5934
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:34,561
Frank,

5935
02:38:34,561 --> 02:38:35,394
submit them.

5936
02:38:35,450 --> 02:38:36,260
And then uh,

5937
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:37,640
after a Frankie fights,

5938
02:38:37,641 --> 02:38:39,680
heath herring steamrolls he heath herring.

5939
02:38:41,270 --> 02:38:43,190
It's amazing how he
remembers all this shit.

5940
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:47,750
Got nothing else or now justified.

5941
02:38:47,751 --> 02:38:49,190
I don't remember anything,

5942
02:38:49,191 --> 02:38:49,400
man.

5943
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:50,420
Just a couple of fights.

5944
02:38:50,421 --> 02:38:53,090
But that's not true because if you're
talking about Jujitsu submissions,

5945
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:54,061
positions,

5946
02:38:54,061 --> 02:38:55,430
submission transitions,

5947
02:38:55,431 --> 02:38:56,031
you could remember,

5948
02:38:56,031 --> 02:38:56,650
shit,

5949
02:38:56,650 --> 02:38:58,880
I see you go over moves and techniques.

5950
02:38:58,881 --> 02:39:00,260
I'm so behind the curve.

5951
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:01,700
Oh,

5952
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:02,271
that's different.

5953
02:39:02,271 --> 02:39:02,751
To start taking.

5954
02:39:02,751 --> 02:39:04,670
Like the odds are,

5955
02:39:04,671 --> 02:39:06,470
is bigfoot knocks him
out in the first round.

5956
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:07,220
That's the,

5957
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:08,150
the highest thoughts.

5958
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:10,220
Other guys out there that can know,

5959
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:11,360
they know every,

5960
02:39:11,361 --> 02:39:15,670
like you could do a UFC trivia game or
jeopardy where they know you could say u

5961
02:39:15,671 --> 02:39:19,440
of c 152 and that could
just rattle off fans,

5962
02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:20,400
not fans for sure.

5963
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:21,200
You're there.

5964
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:22,970
I'm sure Joe's probably damn close.

5965
02:39:23,150 --> 02:39:24,410
Kenny Florian is really good too.

5966
02:39:24,411 --> 02:39:25,370
Kenny knows his shit.

5967
02:39:25,430 --> 02:39:26,390
Every UFC,

5968
02:39:26,391 --> 02:39:27,080
the number,

5969
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:28,630
the headline or the Co headliner.

5970
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:30,170
I bet there's some fans for sure.

5971
02:39:30,171 --> 02:39:34,970
Easy rain men can go into the prelims
and give you that fucking results of the

5972
02:39:34,971 --> 02:39:35,671
prelims.

5973
02:39:35,671 --> 02:39:35,971
The Guy,

5974
02:39:35,971 --> 02:39:37,370
I call him the fight pass king.

5975
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:40,910
He knows all that bypass guys out there.

5976
02:39:41,170 --> 02:39:42,230
We get right.

5977
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:43,730
Have it a little uh,

5978
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:46,340
UFC trivia podcast show once.

5979
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:49,330
These guys are all pretty good.

5980
02:39:49,350 --> 02:39:50,600
Some guys get mad at me.

5981
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:53,060
If I'm watching these
and I don't know a guy,

5982
02:39:53,720 --> 02:39:54,080
I'm going to go,

5983
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:54,913
I'm not working.

5984
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:55,131
Yeah,

5985
02:39:55,131 --> 02:39:55,680
I know.

5986
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:56,513
It's super upset.

5987
02:39:56,890 --> 02:39:57,590
Just watch him.

5988
02:39:57,590 --> 02:39:58,640
I used to know him all.

5989
02:39:58,670 --> 02:39:59,930
I don't know shit anymore.

5990
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,270
I know big foot though.

5991
02:40:02,430 --> 02:40:03,560
Deal with a giant head.

5992
02:40:04,370 --> 02:40:06,050
But one of the things that
I think they fucked up,

5993
02:40:06,051 --> 02:40:06,690
um,

5994
02:40:06,690 --> 02:40:07,230
they should have,

5995
02:40:07,230 --> 02:40:10,910
should have kept going was when you
were doing those in between rounds,

5996
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:12,830
you would do your assessment of who won.

5997
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:14,400
They didn't like it.

5998
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:15,300
I liked your,

5999
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:15,880
I liked,

6000
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:19,080
I really let the commission
didn't like it because Eddie's,

6001
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:20,730
Eddie would have a rationalization.

6002
02:40:20,731 --> 02:40:21,600
He would have a voice,

6003
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:22,531
he'd have to be,

6004
02:40:22,531 --> 02:40:25,130
he could be speakers mind
just like Harold [inaudible].

6005
02:40:25,740 --> 02:40:29,250
I think it makes it exciting for people
because Eddie had it broken down.

6006
02:40:29,310 --> 02:40:29,991
I watched him do it.

6007
02:40:29,991 --> 02:40:31,260
He sat next to me during the fights.

6008
02:40:31,590 --> 02:40:32,070
He,

6009
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:35,700
I mean he was fucking dilligent his shit
and he made his own system instead of

6010
02:40:35,701 --> 02:40:39,090
falling instead of just like looking at
the scorecard and trying to figure it

6011
02:40:39,091 --> 02:40:39,271
out.

6012
02:40:39,271 --> 02:40:41,310
Eddie had a whole breakdown of like kicks,

6013
02:40:41,380 --> 02:40:42,213
takedown,

6014
02:40:42,390 --> 02:40:44,220
shorthand and shorthand.

6015
02:40:44,221 --> 02:40:46,680
Everything had two guys and
I'd look at the fight and go,

6016
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:47,041
kick,

6017
02:40:47,041 --> 02:40:47,431
punch,

6018
02:40:47,431 --> 02:40:47,761
punch,

6019
02:40:47,761 --> 02:40:48,031
punch,

6020
02:40:48,031 --> 02:40:48,570
kick,

6021
02:40:48,570 --> 02:40:49,403
take down,

6022
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:50,341
take down,

6023
02:40:50,341 --> 02:40:54,570
attempt left knee and then after that
round they're giving me 30 seconds to make

6024
02:40:54,571 --> 02:40:55,404
my assessment.

6025
02:40:55,410 --> 02:40:56,790
I got to go back and review.

6026
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:58,260
If you don't write it down like that,

6027
02:40:58,380 --> 02:40:59,280
you don't remember.

6028
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:00,570
You don't remember shit.

6029
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:01,020
Yeah.

6030
02:41:01,020 --> 02:41:02,100
You to go back and look at it.

6031
02:41:02,101 --> 02:41:02,820
So now I go,

6032
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:04,660
I reviewed her that he
landed two punches there.

6033
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:06,090
This guy landed a big knee.

6034
02:41:06,091 --> 02:41:07,890
Which one was more subtle and then Bam.

6035
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:10,350
I have something to look at
when I'm so a lot to look at it.

6036
02:41:10,350 --> 02:41:14,790
So I'd much rather have that than have
these three fucking square's judging my

6037
02:41:14,791 --> 02:41:15,240
fight.

6038
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:15,870
Ridiculous.

6039
02:41:15,870 --> 02:41:16,501
Ridiculous,

6040
02:41:16,501 --> 02:41:17,041
ridiculous.

6041
02:41:17,041 --> 02:41:18,630
Still to this sport.

6042
02:41:18,631 --> 02:41:21,270
I think it's still important to have no,

6043
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:24,100
those schlubs judging what's important.

6044
02:41:24,220 --> 02:41:24,900
What's wrong with it?

6045
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:25,733
I think so.

6046
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:26,770
Are you drunk?

6047
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:28,693
It's gone.

6048
02:41:28,890 --> 02:41:30,370
You got to listen.

6049
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:31,711
Listen,

6050
02:41:31,711 --> 02:41:34,380
Sam as stars and you don't
think you don't think,

6051
02:41:34,381 --> 02:41:35,100
uh,

6052
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:37,770
if you were running the casinos
and you'll run and all that shit,

6053
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:38,604
all the bedding,

6054
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:43,640
you don't think that it's good to have
ball guys that judges good to blame the

6055
02:41:46,141 --> 02:41:47,620
stupid judge like kit,

6056
02:41:47,621 --> 02:41:48,454
stupid judge.

6057
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:54,090
No corruption and casino.

6058
02:41:54,120 --> 02:41:55,010
It's talking about it as me.

6059
02:41:55,430 --> 02:41:57,910
He's going into corruption
and this is another level.

6060
02:41:57,930 --> 02:41:58,763
He can't help it.

6061
02:41:59,950 --> 02:42:01,710
I was running the casinos.

6062
02:42:02,010 --> 02:42:04,460
I would want schlubs in there so that if,

6063
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:06,000
if we looked at the
numbers and we're like,

6064
02:42:06,001 --> 02:42:06,360
shit,

6065
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:08,070
we need this decision or that decision.

6066
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:08,940
Brian talked to him.

6067
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:09,773
I want to say,

6068
02:42:10,310 --> 02:42:10,590
let me,

6069
02:42:10,590 --> 02:42:11,423
let me tell you this.

6070
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:12,593
Let me tell you this.

6071
02:42:12,770 --> 02:42:13,050
No,

6072
02:42:13,050 --> 02:42:13,650
seriously,

6073
02:42:13,650 --> 02:42:17,550
I've had a judge tell me I'm not
gonna say his name and somewhere else.

6074
02:42:17,551 --> 02:42:18,361
I've mentioned his name,

6075
02:42:18,361 --> 02:42:19,570
but I'm not gonna
mention his name tonight.

6076
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:20,700
A judge,

6077
02:42:20,790 --> 02:42:22,020
a very popular,

6078
02:42:22,021 --> 02:42:24,510
popular UFC judge has told me to it.

6079
02:42:24,570 --> 02:42:25,920
I'll say it's judge Judy.

6080
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:31,250
Judge Judy told me that three separate
occasions on three separate occasions,

6081
02:42:31,530 --> 02:42:36,200
he wrote down a score for one fighter
and then when Bruce Buffer Reddit,

6082
02:42:36,650 --> 02:42:39,450
it was for the other guy
three different times.

6083
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:42,420
This guy told me to my
face three different times.

6084
02:42:42,421 --> 02:42:43,380
He's very funny to me.

6085
02:42:43,381 --> 02:42:44,580
Never want to fight against Eddie.

6086
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:47,340
He might be an idiot and I don't know.

6087
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:50,680
He might be looking for a fall guy
as the commission being the same.

6088
02:42:50,690 --> 02:42:52,340
That's what I would say judging.

6089
02:42:52,950 --> 02:42:54,870
That's what I would do if
I was running the casinos.

6090
02:42:55,750 --> 02:42:57,420
Let's watch the fight
we were about to watch.

6091
02:42:57,421 --> 02:42:59,430
We don't want to get fucking killed here.

6092
02:43:00,150 --> 02:43:02,010
These are just my crazy assumptions.

6093
02:43:02,011 --> 02:43:05,010
They're both 35 answering
story about big foot Silva.

6094
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:05,970
When Shane,

6095
02:43:05,970 --> 02:43:10,740
he was like four no five [inaudible] a
lead XC had a big foot Silva's contract.

6096
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:12,520
They offered chain and contract

6097
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,750
to fight big foot Silva.

6098
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:15,370
That fight would have been insane.

6099
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:16,293
Kazoos uh,

6100
02:43:16,630 --> 02:43:18,460
Shane car one who's fucking prime?

6101
02:43:18,490 --> 02:43:20,080
Bigfoot silver in his prime.

6102
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:21,250
They're supposed to fight,

6103
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:22,930
but then the UFC offered Shane.

6104
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:25,160
So then Shane went to the UFC
instead of finding bigfoot.

6105
02:43:25,240 --> 02:43:25,721
So once,

6106
02:43:25,721 --> 02:43:28,510
when Shane was what
looked like healthy men,

6107
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:30,460
healthy human master of the universe.

6108
02:43:31,210 --> 02:43:34,060
Dude coming in at two 61 in this five,

6109
02:43:34,061 --> 02:43:34,421
by the way,

6110
02:43:34,421 --> 02:43:36,970
we're usually walking
around at two 45 I believe.

6111
02:43:36,971 --> 02:43:38,090
No two seats.

6112
02:43:38,110 --> 02:43:38,760
A lot of weight.

6113
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:41,500
He got pretty heavy like right
after he fought Brock foot.

6114
02:43:41,501 --> 02:43:42,730
A little bit of acne on his back.

6115
02:43:42,731 --> 02:43:43,550
That's normal.

6116
02:43:43,550 --> 02:43:44,620
That's normal in Brazil.

6117
02:43:44,621 --> 02:43:45,454
It's hot down there

6118
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:48,023
are sold.

6119
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:51,250
It's hot down there in
are really hot right now.

6120
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,200
Yeah,

6121
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:52,691
that's crazy.

6122
02:43:52,691 --> 02:43:56,510
Is there air conditioning was from the
50 [inaudible] 92 think Maria Amazon.

6123
02:43:56,570 --> 02:43:58,510
He's pissed at the ring girls
for ripping off the shit.

6124
02:43:58,600 --> 02:43:59,120
For sure.

6125
02:43:59,120 --> 02:43:59,920
He's,

6126
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:01,150
he's assigning the Bagpipe,

6127
02:44:01,210 --> 02:44:02,043
pulls him in the back.

6128
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:04,833
He's,

6129
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:06,870
that's his baby's Pavey.

6130
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:08,020
He's telling them to do that.

6131
02:44:08,110 --> 02:44:10,630
He's franchising marking his territory.

6132
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:11,411
You know what I'm saying?

6133
02:44:11,411 --> 02:44:12,191
I'm interested when they do,

6134
02:44:12,191 --> 02:44:16,420
the heart guys know there's a lot of
beef in this ring or this octagon right

6135
02:44:16,421 --> 02:44:16,870
now.

6136
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:19,200
I think when he got mad,

6137
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:21,760
he lost a lot of it's speed,

6138
02:44:21,761 --> 02:44:22,121
man.

6139
02:44:22,121 --> 02:44:22,890
He lost a lot of,

6140
02:44:22,890 --> 02:44:23,723
it's heavy,

6141
02:44:24,130 --> 02:44:24,401
heavy.

6142
02:44:24,401 --> 02:44:27,130
After Brock beat the brakes off mount of
half guard when you pound them out and

6143
02:44:27,131 --> 02:44:27,700
half guard.

6144
02:44:27,700 --> 02:44:28,451
Then he started doing this.

6145
02:44:28,451 --> 02:44:29,950
Powerlifting got all big,

6146
02:44:29,951 --> 02:44:30,880
which wasn't good.

6147
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:32,920
The age of the big,

6148
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:34,540
big heavyweights gone.

6149
02:44:34,720 --> 02:44:35,553
How big are you?

6150
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:36,460
Uh,

6151
02:44:36,460 --> 02:44:37,293
two 40.

6152
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:38,050
Wow.

6153
02:44:38,050 --> 02:44:38,883
That's pretty bad.

6154
02:44:38,910 --> 02:44:40,180
Is it 250 pounds?

6155
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:42,210
What's 25 pounds lighter than the weight?

6156
02:44:42,220 --> 02:44:45,340
Can we get the king at to
two oh five you had to?

6157
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:45,940
Yes.

6158
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:49,150
You're thinking about
it maybe why I say yes.

6159
02:44:49,151 --> 02:44:49,984
Look at that.

6160
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:50,261
Hey,

6161
02:44:50,261 --> 02:44:51,130
if you can make it,

6162
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:52,390
that's your spot.

6163
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:53,980
If you can make it that your spot.

6164
02:44:54,010 --> 02:44:56,140
If you can't make it that simple.

6165
02:44:56,290 --> 02:44:56,740
Who knows?

6166
02:44:56,740 --> 02:44:57,573
Don't want to get into it.

6167
02:44:57,690 --> 02:44:58,060
Hey,

6168
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,330
don't let Joe turned into me

6169
02:45:02,660 --> 02:45:05,320
at two oh five the other bits.

6170
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:07,360
I'll have a big foot please.

6171
02:45:07,720 --> 02:45:08,440
You want big foot,

6172
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:09,250
big foot.

6173
02:45:09,250 --> 02:45:10,083
I got friends.

6174
02:45:11,730 --> 02:45:12,563
You got to action.

6175
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:15,340
I'll take the American
because I'm American.

6176
02:45:15,341 --> 02:45:15,461
Yeah,

6177
02:45:15,461 --> 02:45:16,210
me too.

6178
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:17,043
Fuck yeah.

6179
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:19,480
Big bodies not looking great.

6180
02:45:19,481 --> 02:45:20,261
Come on Frankie.

6181
02:45:20,261 --> 02:45:21,094
Frank.

6182
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:22,450
Bigfoot looks very angry,

6183
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:24,130
so gets a hell of a target though.

6184
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:24,901
That head,

6185
02:45:24,901 --> 02:45:25,870
Chin hot move.

6186
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:27,220
That Shannon's a hell of a target.

6187
02:45:27,490 --> 02:45:28,930
Who Frank looks good man.

6188
02:45:29,050 --> 02:45:29,300
Yeah,

6189
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:30,280
like under his feet there.

6190
02:45:30,730 --> 02:45:31,660
Well that's what he needs,

6191
02:45:31,661 --> 02:45:31,991
man.

6192
02:45:31,991 --> 02:45:33,430
That's what he needs at
this point in his life.

6193
02:45:33,970 --> 02:45:34,930
You need some speed.

6194
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:37,420
I would love if frank submitted them.

6195
02:45:37,570 --> 02:45:37,960
Ooh,

6196
02:45:37,960 --> 02:45:39,510
big foot said he's uh,

6197
02:45:39,550 --> 02:45:40,930
looking for redemption for his boy.

6198
02:45:40,940 --> 02:45:41,950
Knows a black belt,

6199
02:45:41,951 --> 02:45:42,270
right?

6200
02:45:42,270 --> 02:45:42,670
Yes.

6201
02:45:42,670 --> 02:45:44,860
Never been submitted ever in this.

6202
02:45:44,861 --> 02:45:46,840
And even in the game
he's got what he says.

6203
02:45:47,090 --> 02:45:47,923
Good fucking man.

6204
02:45:48,590 --> 02:45:49,423
It's impossible.

6205
02:45:49,670 --> 02:45:50,690
Never been submitted.

6206
02:45:51,070 --> 02:45:51,741
That combination,

6207
02:45:51,741 --> 02:45:52,630
he lands around over him.

6208
02:45:52,660 --> 02:45:57,290
There was one of the best ever that you
haven't seen a Kale like that since Phil

6209
02:45:57,290 --> 02:45:57,291
Baroni Kale.

6210
02:45:57,291 --> 02:45:58,124
Dave Manet,

6211
02:45:58,150 --> 02:45:58,420
everyone.

6212
02:45:58,420 --> 02:45:59,770
He pinned him up against the cage.

6213
02:45:59,800 --> 02:46:00,420
Yeah.

6214
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:00,661
Dang.

6215
02:46:00,661 --> 02:46:00,901
Dang.

6216
02:46:00,901 --> 02:46:01,120
Dang.

6217
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:01,361
Dang.

6218
02:46:01,361 --> 02:46:01,591
Dang,

6219
02:46:01,591 --> 02:46:01,810
Dang.

6220
02:46:01,810 --> 02:46:01,950
Dang.

6221
02:46:01,950 --> 02:46:02,860
Like one of the greatest,

6222
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:04,960
his hand combination kof field we're on.

6223
02:46:04,961 --> 02:46:06,280
He's just number one in my opinion.

6224
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:10,160
That combination was just like
video game named Mark Cord versus

6225
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,000
Tyron Woodley.

6226
02:46:11,030 --> 02:46:11,863
That's my favorite.

6227
02:46:11,870 --> 02:46:12,530
Ooh,

6228
02:46:12,530 --> 02:46:13,430
but that was elbows.

6229
02:46:13,431 --> 02:46:13,881
You know what I mean?

6230
02:46:13,881 --> 02:46:15,020
Still is nasty.

6231
02:46:15,770 --> 02:46:16,603
I didn't believe.

6232
02:46:17,470 --> 02:46:18,303
Yeah,

6233
02:46:18,650 --> 02:46:19,483
he didn't guess.

6234
02:46:19,490 --> 02:46:20,241
Oh look good.

6235
02:46:20,241 --> 02:46:21,070
Right hand,

6236
02:46:21,070 --> 02:46:21,903
right hand by Frank.

6237
02:46:21,970 --> 02:46:22,803
Oh,

6238
02:46:22,990 --> 02:46:23,840
looking fast,

6239
02:46:23,841 --> 02:46:24,021
man.

6240
02:46:24,021 --> 02:46:25,820
He looks much fast than
they just looked recently.

6241
02:46:26,320 --> 02:46:28,220
Frank lives light on his feet.

6242
02:46:28,221 --> 02:46:29,240
He's moving around a lot.

6243
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:30,640
He's moving around like,

6244
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:31,473
man.

6245
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:32,240
Yeah,

6246
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:33,230
well that's what he needs,

6247
02:46:33,231 --> 02:46:33,561
man.

6248
02:46:33,561 --> 02:46:34,700
That's what he was holding him back.

6249
02:46:34,701 --> 02:46:36,830
He was to plotting and he got two big,

6250
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:40,010
big foot always has to
worry about getting hit.

6251
02:46:40,011 --> 02:46:40,340
Man.

6252
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:42,770
He knows his chin is just
not that good anymore.

6253
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,100
When our Lawsky clipped
him with at one point,

6254
02:46:46,101 --> 02:46:46,880
I mean it didn't,

6255
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:49,880
but before that eight punches
from the hardest puncher ever.

6256
02:46:49,881 --> 02:46:53,780
Really in the USA when
he was Jews to the titty.

6257
02:46:53,781 --> 02:46:54,710
Either way though,

6258
02:46:54,711 --> 02:46:55,131
Brian,

6259
02:46:55,131 --> 02:46:56,150
but that affects you.

6260
02:46:56,151 --> 02:46:56,810
I guarantee you.

6261
02:46:56,810 --> 02:46:57,501
That affects you.

6262
02:46:57,501 --> 02:46:58,334
It has to.

6263
02:46:58,580 --> 02:47:00,290
It just only makes sense that it does.

6264
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:01,340
How ironic.

6265
02:47:01,580 --> 02:47:02,300
Isn't it weird?

6266
02:47:02,300 --> 02:47:04,200
His arms look really skinny on.

6267
02:47:04,250 --> 02:47:04,640
Oh yeah.

6268
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:04,881
Hey man,

6269
02:47:04,881 --> 02:47:05,480
I'm going crazy.

6270
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:05,780
No,

6271
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:06,330
they don't look,

6272
02:47:06,330 --> 02:47:06,610
I mean,

6273
02:47:06,610 --> 02:47:07,443
they don't look big at all.

6274
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:09,860
They look like Brian
Collins arms on a big body

6275
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:12,800
like coil vipers.

6276
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:14,900
The bones underneath them.

6277
02:47:14,901 --> 02:47:19,340
I like telephone poles just
to make [inaudible] it's over.

6278
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:20,480
It's over right there

6279
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:27,790
still Donesville dance
and you'll look good,

6280
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:30,320
right?

6281
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:31,153
The tank.

6282
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:32,540
I don't have any American currency.

6283
02:47:32,541 --> 02:47:33,270
What did he say,

6284
02:47:33,270 --> 02:47:34,103
man?

6285
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:35,210
What did he just say?

6286
02:47:36,410 --> 02:47:37,540
He just said something.

6287
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:38,181
Damn,

6288
02:47:38,181 --> 02:47:39,050
that's a big cut.

6289
02:47:39,490 --> 02:47:41,330
Big Foot just squirted when he stood up.

6290
02:47:42,380 --> 02:47:43,810
[inaudible]

6291
02:47:43,810 --> 02:47:44,580
son,

6292
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:45,290
you know?

6293
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:48,550
That's why I bet on him and that's why
I want a dollar from John Wayne Park

6294
02:47:48,710 --> 02:47:51,290
because I just don't feel like
this dude can take a punch anymore.

6295
02:47:51,291 --> 02:47:54,320
I don't like the way he
went down against our LAUSC.

6296
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:56,720
It looked crazy like you
went down and I was like,

6297
02:47:56,730 --> 02:47:57,110
whoa.

6298
02:47:57,110 --> 02:47:58,700
You think it's a lack of TRT?

6299
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:00,230
I think I did it for sure.

6300
02:48:00,231 --> 02:48:01,770
If I think it's a number look at this.

6301
02:48:01,970 --> 02:48:03,680
That's a nice combination,

6302
02:48:03,681 --> 02:48:04,250
man.

6303
02:48:04,250 --> 02:48:05,570
A Jab left hook.

6304
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:07,700
That's some fucking buster Douglas Shit.

6305
02:48:08,690 --> 02:48:09,300
Hell yeah.

6306
02:48:09,300 --> 02:48:11,210
Let do this in Brazil.

6307
02:48:11,211 --> 02:48:12,250
Bone is lepto.

6308
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:13,580
Beautiful Man.

6309
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:14,451
I'm sorry.

6310
02:48:14,451 --> 02:48:16,580
That is a beautiful combination

6311
02:48:18,170 --> 02:48:18,561
for sure.

6312
02:48:18,561 --> 02:48:19,394
Stop the food that,

6313
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:20,061
oh dude,

6314
02:48:20,061 --> 02:48:20,960
he's dead.

6315
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:23,060
You don't really see Frank
Mir grounding pounding,

6316
02:48:23,061 --> 02:48:23,810
but Goddamn,

6317
02:48:23,810 --> 02:48:24,643
he has vicious crime.

6318
02:48:24,650 --> 02:48:24,920
Dude.

6319
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:26,580
That was man.

6320
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:27,290
You can do it all.

6321
02:48:27,290 --> 02:48:28,940
That was fucking Nice,

6322
02:48:28,941 --> 02:48:29,774
dude.

6323
02:48:29,900 --> 02:48:31,490
This is the Frank Mir of old.

6324
02:48:31,491 --> 02:48:33,980
This is a really good
look and Frank Mir here.

6325
02:48:34,030 --> 02:48:34,250
Ooh,

6326
02:48:34,250 --> 02:48:35,031
I'm impressed.

6327
02:48:35,031 --> 02:48:35,570
Wow.

6328
02:48:35,570 --> 02:48:38,630
That is fucking ferocious
through town for frank,

6329
02:48:38,631 --> 02:48:38,811
man.

6330
02:48:38,811 --> 02:48:39,411
I'm impressed.

6331
02:48:39,411 --> 02:48:40,244
Good for him.

6332
02:48:40,790 --> 02:48:41,840
Thank you for the dollar,

6333
02:48:41,841 --> 02:48:42,370
frank.

6334
02:48:42,370 --> 02:48:43,203
Yeah.

6335
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:47,240
What does he say?

6336
02:48:47,240 --> 02:48:48,740
Does he think he's
talking to Brock Lesnar?

6337
02:48:48,890 --> 02:48:50,000
I'm back now.

6338
02:48:50,001 --> 02:48:51,530
You said something like,

6339
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:52,370
you know,

6340
02:48:52,370 --> 02:48:53,203
I don't know what he said.

6341
02:48:53,210 --> 02:48:54,043
I hope not.

6342
02:48:54,790 --> 02:48:55,290
I hope not.

6343
02:48:55,290 --> 02:48:55,860
What?

6344
02:48:55,860 --> 02:48:56,910
He's not talking to Prague.

6345
02:48:57,320 --> 02:48:57,471
Well,

6346
02:48:57,471 --> 02:48:58,340
that fight is over,

6347
02:48:58,341 --> 02:48:59,180
so the fights are over.

6348
02:48:59,181 --> 02:49:01,730
Let's rewind it and see if we could
figure out what the fuck he said.

6349
02:49:01,970 --> 02:49:03,050
Can we rewind it Jamie?

6350
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:03,710
We got a remote.

6351
02:49:03,710 --> 02:49:04,271
Maybe he'll read.

6352
02:49:04,271 --> 02:49:06,350
Say it in the post
interview right here though,

6353
02:49:06,570 --> 02:49:07,403
right?

6354
02:49:07,490 --> 02:49:08,323
Maybe.

6355
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:08,671
Yeah,

6356
02:49:08,671 --> 02:49:09,300
maybe.

6357
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:09,481
Yeah,

6358
02:49:09,481 --> 02:49:10,111
that's a good point.

6359
02:49:10,111 --> 02:49:10,980
We should let him say it.

6360
02:49:11,010 --> 02:49:11,281
Yeah,

6361
02:49:11,281 --> 02:49:12,920
maybe I can read those guys.

6362
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:13,740
Well that's good news.

6363
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:13,841
Yeah.

6364
02:49:13,841 --> 02:49:15,690
Bright Red Lipstick for the marinas.

6365
02:49:15,950 --> 02:49:16,140
Yeah,

6366
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:16,973
I did.

6367
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:19,760
Let's see what he says.

6368
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:20,120
He goes,

6369
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:20,560
boom,

6370
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:21,393
boom.

6371
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:25,583
Here it goes.

6372
02:49:27,770 --> 02:49:28,620
I watched you this.

6373
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:30,840
So was he trying to do,

6374
02:49:30,841 --> 02:49:31,950
he told her I love you baby.

6375
02:49:32,550 --> 02:49:33,150
Don't talk.

6376
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:33,880
Why would you talk?

6377
02:49:33,880 --> 02:49:35,150
That's the only thing we were waiting for.

6378
02:49:35,190 --> 02:49:35,760
Sorry Buddy.

6379
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:36,593
I love you babe.

6380
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:37,890
No biggest inspiration.

6381
02:49:42,800 --> 02:49:43,270
Oh yeah,

6382
02:49:43,270 --> 02:49:43,940
it wasn't DC.

6383
02:49:43,940 --> 02:49:44,960
Daddy's making the money.

6384
02:49:44,990 --> 02:49:47,720
I think something along those
lines and get some money.

6385
02:49:47,810 --> 02:49:48,870
That was bringing the bill.

6386
02:49:49,250 --> 02:49:50,083
Yeah,

6387
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:51,500
it's making that money.

6388
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:51,980
Yeah,

6389
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:52,850
I love you baby.

6390
02:49:52,851 --> 02:49:53,930
Daddy's making that money.

6391
02:49:53,960 --> 02:49:54,500
There you go.

6392
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:55,070
Wow.

6393
02:49:55,070 --> 02:49:56,240
That's the best thing
he could could've said.

6394
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:59,270
You Look God Damn Good Fucking Jab,

6395
02:49:59,271 --> 02:50:01,280
left hook combination was very pretty.

6396
02:50:01,370 --> 02:50:03,650
What do you do if your big foot retire?

6397
02:50:04,420 --> 02:50:06,780
Damn for him and keeping him apprised.

6398
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:07,783
Yeah.

6399
02:50:08,270 --> 02:50:10,130
I don't think he can fight
without testosterone.

6400
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:13,580
This is what I think it all
the people that were on TRT,

6401
02:50:13,820 --> 02:50:16,340
that guy has the most
legitimate reason to be on it.

6402
02:50:16,341 --> 02:50:20,060
He had a god damn cancer
of his pituitary gland.

6403
02:50:20,450 --> 02:50:20,750
I mean,

6404
02:50:20,750 --> 02:50:21,330
look at that.

6405
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:22,400
That's a beautiful comment,

6406
02:50:22,430 --> 02:50:24,080
but if you have to have that to fight,

6407
02:50:24,110 --> 02:50:24,943
don't fight.

6408
02:50:24,950 --> 02:50:25,401
You're right.

6409
02:50:25,401 --> 02:50:26,234
Fuck that noise.

6410
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:26,690
You're right.

6411
02:50:26,690 --> 02:50:27,750
I don't give a fuck what she got.

6412
02:50:28,460 --> 02:50:29,510
Boom.

6413
02:50:29,930 --> 02:50:30,321
You're right.

6414
02:50:30,321 --> 02:50:32,090
If you have to be juice
to the gills to compete,

6415
02:50:32,480 --> 02:50:33,470
how about you don't do it?

6416
02:50:33,471 --> 02:50:34,390
How would you go find something else?

6417
02:50:34,470 --> 02:50:39,020
But I think is his natural testosterone
is absurdly low because of the fact that

6418
02:50:39,021 --> 02:50:40,660
he had a tumor on his butt tour.

6419
02:50:40,690 --> 02:50:43,880
Derek Lam and his coaches were
talking about when they eliminated a

6420
02:50:43,881 --> 02:50:44,511
testosterone,

6421
02:50:44,511 --> 02:50:45,980
like how bad it is for him.

6422
02:50:46,310 --> 02:50:47,143
Cool.

6423
02:50:47,300 --> 02:50:47,870
You're right.

6424
02:50:47,870 --> 02:50:48,703
You're right.

6425
02:50:48,980 --> 02:50:49,491
Otherwise,

6426
02:50:49,491 --> 02:50:50,170
let me do it.

6427
02:50:50,170 --> 02:50:50,391
You're right.

6428
02:50:50,391 --> 02:50:51,081
Whatever you're taking,

6429
02:50:51,081 --> 02:50:51,710
I get to do it.

6430
02:50:51,710 --> 02:50:52,580
I think it was legal.

6431
02:50:52,581 --> 02:50:53,414
Would you do it?

6432
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:55,753
I'll say yes for him.

6433
02:51:00,020 --> 02:51:02,730
My client will not speak loud it himself.

6434
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:03,610
It's a little bit right.

6435
02:51:04,450 --> 02:51:05,840
Creamy just for recovery.

6436
02:51:05,841 --> 02:51:06,190
Right.

6437
02:51:06,190 --> 02:51:08,420
And he looked at me and we'll
answer your questions or Joe Rogan,

6438
02:51:08,421 --> 02:51:08,991
please look at me.

6439
02:51:08,991 --> 02:51:09,824
Eddie

6440
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:11,660
saw.

6441
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:12,493
I'm saying,

6442
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:13,783
that's all I'm saying.

6443
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:16,440
I really liked you.

6444
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:18,160
What you said the other day about the um,

6445
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:19,100
there isn't any negatives.

6446
02:51:19,101 --> 02:51:19,830
Just taking it.

6447
02:51:19,830 --> 02:51:20,420
Yeah.

6448
02:51:20,420 --> 02:51:20,630
Yeah.

6449
02:51:20,630 --> 02:51:22,130
I thought that was a really good read.

6450
02:51:22,760 --> 02:51:23,121
Yeah.

6451
02:51:23,121 --> 02:51:24,030
It's uh,

6452
02:51:24,050 --> 02:51:24,883
it's tough man.

6453
02:51:24,890 --> 02:51:27,710
But with these new penalties that
Dana White's talking about doing,

6454
02:51:27,711 --> 02:51:28,461
if they actually do it,

6455
02:51:28,461 --> 02:51:31,220
the two to four years suspension guys are,

6456
02:51:31,250 --> 02:51:31,491
yeah,

6457
02:51:31,491 --> 02:51:32,690
they're not going to risk it as much,

6458
02:51:32,691 --> 02:51:33,201
I don't think.

6459
02:51:33,201 --> 02:51:33,380
Yeah.

6460
02:51:33,380 --> 02:51:35,750
I think it's the only way to go
because when bigfoot got done,

6461
02:51:35,751 --> 02:51:38,490
then he's first fight back is for
main of the main event in Brazil.

6462
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:40,490
What did you guys think when it's,

6463
02:51:40,491 --> 02:51:44,540
for me a and John Jones both
had those really weird tests.

6464
02:51:44,930 --> 02:51:49,340
Like they tested them afterwards and they
both had a really low testosterone to

6465
02:51:49,341 --> 02:51:50,870
epitestosterone level.

6466
02:51:51,080 --> 02:51:51,920
What are you doing here?

6467
02:51:51,950 --> 02:51:53,290
What's going on here?

6468
02:51:53,880 --> 02:51:54,230
No,

6469
02:51:54,230 --> 02:51:54,981
you guys talk about,

6470
02:51:54,981 --> 02:51:55,281
you know,

6471
02:51:55,281 --> 02:51:55,820
something.

6472
02:51:55,820 --> 02:51:58,140
I don't know anything positive.

6473
02:52:00,910 --> 02:52:01,400
I promise.

6474
02:52:01,400 --> 02:52:01,971
I don't know anything.

6475
02:52:01,971 --> 02:52:02,640
Okay.

6476
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:03,030
All right,

6477
02:52:03,030 --> 02:52:04,830
well I shouldn't even
ask you right now though,

6478
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:06,370
isn't true from from

6479
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:08,920
that when your testosterone
is very low like that,

6480
02:52:08,950 --> 02:52:10,180
chances are you were,

6481
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:11,611
you introduced.

6482
02:52:11,611 --> 02:52:13,330
That's what Victor Conte was saying,

6483
02:52:13,331 --> 02:52:16,000
but I think that's irresponsible
to say unless you're,

6484
02:52:16,130 --> 02:52:17,560
you're testing these guys all the time.

6485
02:52:17,740 --> 02:52:18,600
It could be that there were,

6486
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:18,850
bro,

6487
02:52:18,850 --> 02:52:20,680
I heard a bunch of different variables.

6488
02:52:21,070 --> 02:52:22,380
One of them that could be their,

6489
02:52:22,490 --> 02:52:26,310
their body was broken down because they're
exhausted from training so much and

6490
02:52:26,320 --> 02:52:28,840
that their testosterone was low
because they caught him in mid camp.

6491
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:30,610
That could be the case.

6492
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:32,470
It could be that they
were both overtrained,

6493
02:52:32,650 --> 02:52:35,750
which is more likely than not
if you want to look at it like,

6494
02:52:36,040 --> 02:52:37,000
but I don't know.

6495
02:52:37,001 --> 02:52:37,151
See,

6496
02:52:37,151 --> 02:52:37,751
I'm an idiot.

6497
02:52:37,751 --> 02:52:40,300
I don't understand those
tests enough to tell you.

6498
02:52:40,301 --> 02:52:44,950
If that would cause someone to have a low
testosterone to epitestosterone ratio.

6499
02:52:45,130 --> 02:52:47,080
We would have to bring
in like Mark Gordon.

6500
02:52:47,081 --> 02:52:50,050
We have to bring in an endocrinologist
to explain and you'd also have to do more

6501
02:52:50,051 --> 02:52:50,770
than one test.

6502
02:52:50,770 --> 02:52:51,640
And based off that,

6503
02:52:51,670 --> 02:52:52,441
that's why I don't come.

6504
02:52:52,441 --> 02:52:52,810
And I mean,

6505
02:52:52,810 --> 02:52:55,560
I don't know those guys
who the fuck knows,

6506
02:52:55,561 --> 02:52:56,560
but I know they uh,

6507
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:59,230
they had like a legit guy
doctor read the thing.

6508
02:52:59,231 --> 02:53:01,750
It was like there's no way
their levels should be that low.

6509
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:02,560
Yeah,

6510
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:03,670
but they don't know what's going on.

6511
02:53:03,671 --> 02:53:04,001
Maybe.

6512
02:53:04,001 --> 02:53:06,520
Maybe D D C in John's
levels have always been low.

6513
02:53:06,550 --> 02:53:09,100
Let's crank the volume up so he
could hear what Frank Mir also say.

6514
02:53:10,030 --> 02:53:11,220
Huge win for French.

6515
02:53:11,221 --> 02:53:11,800
Huge.

6516
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:12,611
And not only that,

6517
02:53:12,611 --> 02:53:14,830
but looked fucking great man.

6518
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:16,010
It's cool to see these guys.

6519
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:18,220
Your bodybuilding days.

6520
02:53:18,390 --> 02:53:19,750
What was the stove situation?

6521
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:20,111
Hold on.

6522
02:53:20,111 --> 02:53:20,531
Let's hear this.

6523
02:53:20,531 --> 02:53:21,190
Let's say this.

6524
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:21,990
I work on my lats.

6525
02:53:21,990 --> 02:53:22,823
Mosley.

6526
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:27,033
Wow.

6527
02:53:27,350 --> 02:53:29,030
No heavyweight is much higher than him.

6528
02:53:36,290 --> 02:53:38,090
I could've swore fracking in English.

6529
02:53:45,930 --> 02:53:47,120
She said to heal my body.

6530
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:50,390
I got to of some good
trainers and break brown.

6531
02:53:51,210 --> 02:53:51,721
How about Ricky?

6532
02:53:51,721 --> 02:53:53,940
Lindale right behind you
looking all angry face.

6533
02:53:54,750 --> 02:53:55,583
There we go.

6534
02:54:00,710 --> 02:54:02,240
Obviously it's a three switch to right.

6535
02:54:04,470 --> 02:54:05,303
You switched.

6536
02:54:06,310 --> 02:54:07,240
I didn't even notice that.

6537
02:54:07,390 --> 02:54:07,690
God,

6538
02:54:07,690 --> 02:54:08,523
I didn't either.

6539
02:54:08,870 --> 02:54:10,660
That was such a beautiful combination.

6540
02:54:10,661 --> 02:54:11,494
Ma'Am.

6541
02:54:14,250 --> 02:54:16,980
I only move three inches to the beautiful.

6542
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:18,120
Beautiful.

6543
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:19,230
Especially with those little gloves.

6544
02:54:19,231 --> 02:54:19,590
Right.

6545
02:54:19,590 --> 02:54:20,423
Big Difference.

6546
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:24,990
How much adjustment do you
have to make defensively,

6547
02:54:24,991 --> 02:54:25,291
John,

6548
02:54:25,291 --> 02:54:26,340
when you're working with guys,

6549
02:54:26,350 --> 02:54:26,640
we,

6550
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:30,090
I'm sure you've trained with MMA fighters
and teaching them Moitai how much of

6551
02:54:30,091 --> 02:54:30,924
a,

6552
02:54:31,080 --> 02:54:35,460
an adjustment you have to make because
they have less coverage defensively

6553
02:54:35,461 --> 02:54:36,750
because of the smaller gloves.

6554
02:54:36,751 --> 02:54:36,961
Yeah.

6555
02:54:36,961 --> 02:54:39,540
It wasn't until I started wearing them
for getting ready for the fight that I

6556
02:54:39,541 --> 02:54:41,490
really appreciated how different it is.

6557
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:43,200
It was like starting all over again.

6558
02:54:43,201 --> 02:54:44,210
Once I put the little ones on,

6559
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:47,040
I thought I knew how to fight and you
thought and you had a punch until I wore

6560
02:54:47,041 --> 02:54:47,600
them,

6561
02:54:47,600 --> 02:54:47,821
I was like,

6562
02:54:47,821 --> 02:54:48,451
Holy Shit,

6563
02:54:48,451 --> 02:54:48,961
I'm not punching.

6564
02:54:48,961 --> 02:54:49,950
I'm not punching on my knuckles.

6565
02:54:49,951 --> 02:54:52,890
I'm using my pinky and before I could
close my eyes and hit the pads and their

6566
02:54:52,891 --> 02:54:55,770
problem and now I can't hit
the pad in the same spot twice.

6567
02:54:55,771 --> 02:54:57,360
Even when I'm fully concentrating.

6568
02:54:57,361 --> 02:54:58,171
It's so difficult.

6569
02:54:58,171 --> 02:54:58,920
It's so hard.

6570
02:54:58,920 --> 02:54:59,221
Wow.

6571
02:54:59,221 --> 02:55:00,240
That's interesting man.

6572
02:55:00,660 --> 02:55:00,931
Yeah.

6573
02:55:00,931 --> 02:55:01,170
But,

6574
02:55:01,170 --> 02:55:02,003
um,

6575
02:55:02,730 --> 02:55:03,170
yeah,

6576
02:55:03,170 --> 02:55:05,570
completely different stuff
from our hooks in Verena idea.

6577
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:06,591
Great idea.

6578
02:55:06,591 --> 02:55:11,591
Kickboxing with MMA gloves in a
[inaudible] it's pretty much MMA,

6579
02:55:13,310 --> 02:55:14,960
but with no ground because
you're still at the knees.

6580
02:55:14,961 --> 02:55:15,800
Just do what the elbows,

6581
02:55:15,801 --> 02:55:16,421
you still got the,

6582
02:55:16,421 --> 02:55:17,151
the takedowns.

6583
02:55:17,151 --> 02:55:18,490
There's nothing changes and you get,

6584
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:21,980
do you find guys press guys are up
against the cage and blast him with elbows

6585
02:55:21,981 --> 02:55:24,220
and knees the body and
hold them there and yeah,

6586
02:55:24,230 --> 02:55:24,480
we'll,

6587
02:55:24,480 --> 02:55:26,390
what I found with my shows is say it,

6588
02:55:26,391 --> 02:55:27,260
I have 10 fights,

6589
02:55:27,290 --> 02:55:28,340
majority this.

6590
02:55:28,370 --> 02:55:30,920
Usually there will be seven go the
distance because the guys are fighting

6591
02:55:30,921 --> 02:55:33,710
smarter as well because they know that
they can't stand in the pocket and trade

6592
02:55:33,711 --> 02:55:35,180
anymore because the gloves are so small.

6593
02:55:36,410 --> 02:55:38,210
They're bringing a better a game now.

6594
02:55:41,390 --> 02:55:42,560
I noticed that after the fight,

6595
02:55:42,561 --> 02:55:45,320
you can't touch the top of your head
if we're about four or five days,

6596
02:55:45,321 --> 02:55:47,600
you can't put your sunglasses on
because your head's like a golf ball.

6597
02:55:47,750 --> 02:55:48,583
Oh Wow.

6598
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:50,013
Wow.

6599
02:55:52,620 --> 02:55:55,220
They're getting hit 50 to
a hundred times a fight.

6600
02:55:55,550 --> 02:55:56,170
Yeah.

6601
02:55:56,170 --> 02:55:56,540
Yeah.

6602
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:57,030
Easily.

6603
02:55:57,030 --> 02:55:57,180
Yeah.

6604
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:57,800
Tone.

6605
02:55:57,800 --> 02:55:57,980
Hey,

6606
02:55:57,980 --> 02:55:58,970
50 Shung.

6607
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:04,010
Remember when you described a fight that
you had when you were in high school,

6608
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:07,340
like it was two punches that you,

6609
02:56:07,350 --> 02:56:08,930
you talked about how
you landed two punches,

6610
02:56:08,931 --> 02:56:10,610
put your friends like
bitch you didn't land.

6611
02:56:11,060 --> 02:56:12,160
It was like two or three,

6612
02:56:12,350 --> 02:56:15,180
three if he didn't believe that shit like,

6613
02:56:15,510 --> 02:56:19,160
but in MMA fights like
land 50 to a hundred solid,

6614
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:23,450
he imagined describing that fight to
somebody because you always described your

6615
02:56:23,451 --> 02:56:23,841
fight ride.

6616
02:56:23,841 --> 02:56:24,740
He tried to take me down,

6617
02:56:24,741 --> 02:56:28,920
then I punched him and then the PE
teacher pulled us off trying to describe a

6618
02:56:29,100 --> 02:56:33,560
fight with 50 punches cause somebody
you can't remember it had to take him

6619
02:56:33,561 --> 02:56:34,394
through the whole thing.

6620
02:56:34,550 --> 02:56:38,390
There's a lot of guys that have to watch
fights after they're over just to see

6621
02:56:38,391 --> 02:56:39,290
what happened to them.

6622
02:56:39,291 --> 02:56:39,860
They don't even remember.

6623
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:39,860
I

6624
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:40,830
remember what happened.

6625
02:56:41,400 --> 02:56:44,820
How many times have I interviewed fighters
and they'll be honest like after the

6626
02:56:44,821 --> 02:56:45,331
second round,

6627
02:56:45,331 --> 02:56:46,350
I have no idea what happened.

6628
02:56:46,770 --> 02:56:47,291
I don't know.

6629
02:56:47,291 --> 02:56:49,020
That just woke up and
it was the fifth round.

6630
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:51,270
You know that's happened
so many times man,

6631
02:56:51,900 --> 02:56:52,733
so much.

6632
02:56:52,740 --> 02:56:53,251
Most fights,

6633
02:56:53,251 --> 02:56:55,200
like if you asked me like go
and have in the second round,

6634
02:56:55,201 --> 02:56:56,640
I can't tell you third round like Cro,

6635
02:56:56,641 --> 02:56:58,290
cop and I don't remember a lot from it.

6636
02:56:58,700 --> 02:57:00,180
And I just remember being in zone.

6637
02:57:00,980 --> 02:57:02,610
What was interesting about
the Travis Brown fight,

6638
02:57:03,390 --> 02:57:04,800
I was rocked when,

6639
02:57:04,860 --> 02:57:05,280
uh,

6640
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:08,160
I went for a takedown and
he wizard I in his hip,

6641
02:57:08,161 --> 02:57:12,330
landed on my head into the octagon and
I remember watching it and you're like,

6642
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:12,541
oh,

6643
02:57:12,541 --> 02:57:14,250
I don't remember any of this after this.

6644
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:15,413
And I remember,

6645
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:17,160
I just remember watching like,

6646
02:57:17,161 --> 02:57:17,890
Dang,

6647
02:57:17,890 --> 02:57:19,950
like the first time I've
ever seen you were just,

6648
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:20,660
I was more,

6649
02:57:20,660 --> 02:57:21,493
bell was a mess.

6650
02:57:21,930 --> 02:57:22,121
Yeah.

6651
02:57:22,121 --> 02:57:23,870
I messed up just from his hip check that.

6652
02:57:24,220 --> 02:57:24,380
Well,

6653
02:57:24,380 --> 02:57:26,450
the problem from the Mat.

6654
02:57:26,460 --> 02:57:26,760
Yeah.

6655
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:28,890
When you see a guy like
George Saint Pierre,

6656
02:57:28,891 --> 02:57:31,110
that was like the greatest of all time.

6657
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:31,651
And now,

6658
02:57:31,651 --> 02:57:31,891
you know,

6659
02:57:31,891 --> 02:57:33,210
since he didn't test positive,

6660
02:57:34,110 --> 02:57:35,790
a lot of people are saying
he's the greatest of all time.

6661
02:57:35,791 --> 02:57:36,750
100% person.

6662
02:57:36,930 --> 02:57:37,141
Oh,

6663
02:57:37,141 --> 02:57:38,500
he needs to understand how works.

6664
02:57:38,720 --> 02:57:39,300
Yeah.

6665
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:40,530
Well I see that argument.

6666
02:57:40,560 --> 02:57:41,790
It's a very logical argument,

6667
02:57:41,820 --> 02:57:44,310
but when you look at the numbers
of times that he was hit,

6668
02:57:44,690 --> 02:57:44,940
they,

6669
02:57:44,940 --> 02:57:47,370
we did a thing after his career was over.

6670
02:57:47,371 --> 02:57:49,230
It was over 800 times.

6671
02:57:49,270 --> 02:57:50,670
So Craig just in the octagon.

6672
02:57:50,690 --> 02:57:50,950
Yeah.

6673
02:57:50,950 --> 02:57:54,020
Not Train on changes and not in TK.

6674
02:57:54,021 --> 02:57:54,331
Oh,

6675
02:57:54,331 --> 02:57:56,910
and the other organizations he
fought for before he came to the UFC.

6676
02:57:57,420 --> 02:58:00,000
And you know what a lot of
it was the last few fights,

6677
02:58:00,090 --> 02:58:00,923
a lot of it,

6678
02:58:01,110 --> 02:58:02,040
you got to hit more in

6679
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:05,280
his last like four fights
and all of his other fights.

6680
02:58:05,880 --> 02:58:06,750
It's amazing man.

6681
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:08,310
Let's watch this again man.

6682
02:58:09,930 --> 02:58:12,330
God Damn Frank Mir look
good even before that.

6683
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:13,860
Like light on his feet too.

6684
02:58:13,870 --> 02:58:14,970
That is beautiful.

6685
02:58:14,971 --> 02:58:15,840
I'm off man.

6686
02:58:15,900 --> 02:58:16,710
Really helped them.

6687
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:17,041
Fuck.

6688
02:58:17,041 --> 02:58:17,340
Yeah.

6689
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:21,990
Maybe that switching standards
to that is back to Orthodox.

6690
02:58:22,020 --> 02:58:23,430
That is tremendous right there.

6691
02:58:23,670 --> 02:58:24,503
Look at that.

6692
02:58:24,630 --> 02:58:26,040
That's beautiful technique.

6693
02:58:26,490 --> 02:58:27,690
He's such a smart dude.

6694
02:58:27,691 --> 02:58:28,381
Frank Mir is,

6695
02:58:28,381 --> 02:58:29,910
he's an interesting character.

6696
02:58:29,911 --> 02:58:31,140
Have you ever heard of misunderstood?

6697
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:32,100
Have you heard him commentating?

6698
02:58:32,101 --> 02:58:33,420
When did wcs and he was really,

6699
02:58:33,421 --> 02:58:34,200
really good man.

6700
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:36,380
Well when he said he wanted
to kill Brock Lesnar,

6701
02:58:36,390 --> 02:58:37,410
be the first guy to kill him.

6702
02:58:37,411 --> 02:58:38,880
That's when they pulled
them off commentary.

6703
02:58:38,910 --> 02:58:39,061
Yeah.

6704
02:58:39,061 --> 02:58:40,340
You kind of going a half day.

6705
02:58:40,590 --> 02:58:42,540
Nobody remembers that shit anymore.

6706
02:58:42,541 --> 02:58:43,111
He's good.

6707
02:58:43,111 --> 02:58:43,944
Put them back in.

6708
02:58:43,950 --> 02:58:44,370
Yeah.

6709
02:58:44,370 --> 02:58:44,880
Oh he's the,

6710
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:45,840
he's one of the best.

6711
02:58:46,110 --> 02:58:47,460
I wish you would do more of it.

6712
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:48,750
Well he's very smart man.

6713
02:58:48,751 --> 02:58:49,620
He's very articulate.

6714
02:58:49,621 --> 02:58:50,640
He reads a lot of books.

6715
02:58:50,880 --> 02:58:51,580
You know,

6716
02:58:51,580 --> 02:58:53,250
he's an interesting dude that Frank Mir.

6717
02:58:53,251 --> 02:58:54,061
I liked that.

6718
02:58:54,061 --> 02:58:56,010
I like when a guy takes a little time off,

6719
02:58:56,710 --> 02:58:57,930
it takes a deep breath.

6720
02:58:57,931 --> 02:58:59,550
Reassesses gets back kid.

6721
02:58:59,551 --> 02:59:00,750
Sometimes dudes run,

6722
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:05,160
they run on all these injuries and they
just fucking keep just trying to tape

6723
02:59:05,161 --> 02:59:10,161
this up and patch that up and stretch
through this and they don't just take that

6724
02:59:11,011 --> 02:59:12,240
time to recuperate.

6725
02:59:12,330 --> 02:59:14,150
You know what's crazy is Baca.

6726
02:59:14,200 --> 02:59:18,470
When MMA first start exploring the
UFC first art exploding people.

6727
02:59:18,471 --> 02:59:18,661
It's like,

6728
02:59:18,661 --> 02:59:19,081
man,

6729
02:59:19,081 --> 02:59:20,400
how does it feel that you have huge,

6730
02:59:20,670 --> 02:59:23,970
I would always say cause coming from
being at such a big football fan,

6731
02:59:24,060 --> 02:59:29,060
I thought well the UFC really isn't that
huge yet until we start seeing these

6732
02:59:29,490 --> 02:59:31,110
like football type NFL,

6733
02:59:31,111 --> 02:59:35,100
the day type shows like
a nightly NMA show.

6734
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:36,660
We haven't stayed like 10 years ago.

6735
02:59:36,661 --> 02:59:38,370
We hadn't seen it now.

6736
02:59:38,371 --> 02:59:39,230
How crazy is it?

6737
02:59:39,250 --> 02:59:39,570
W We,

6738
02:59:39,570 --> 02:59:40,890
we see it all the time.

6739
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:42,260
Like right now we're watching and,

6740
02:59:42,430 --> 02:59:47,430
and Brian stands in a suit and Dominick
Cruz is in a suit and they're prime time

6741
02:59:49,290 --> 02:59:53,700
nationwide on these major networks and
now they're the guys that I'm used to

6742
02:59:53,701 --> 02:59:55,020
seeing like a Lt,

6743
02:59:55,021 --> 02:59:55,261
you know,

6744
02:59:55,261 --> 02:59:56,100
do that kind of stuff.

6745
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:56,940
Or,

6746
02:59:56,940 --> 02:59:58,690
or Tony Serra Goose.

6747
02:59:58,691 --> 02:59:59,401
So you know what I mean?

6748
02:59:59,401 --> 03:00:04,320
Being ex ex players now transitioning
into broadcasting and you're seeing that

6749
03:00:04,321 --> 03:00:05,011
in MMA now.

6750
03:00:05,011 --> 03:00:07,140
All these ex MMA fighters or,

6751
03:00:07,320 --> 03:00:07,830
or,

6752
03:00:07,830 --> 03:00:08,730
or even current ones,

6753
03:00:08,731 --> 03:00:09,800
really their transit,

6754
03:00:09,810 --> 03:00:11,940
they're putting the suits
on and they're on Fox.

6755
03:00:12,740 --> 03:00:13,290
It's nuts.

6756
03:00:13,290 --> 03:00:14,041
It's crazy.

6757
03:00:14,041 --> 03:00:14,821
Look at Brian Stan,

6758
03:00:14,821 --> 03:00:15,601
he's on this is,

6759
03:00:15,601 --> 03:00:18,730
you're used to seeing him like some
college basketball show right now.

6760
03:00:18,910 --> 03:00:19,471
Dan also,

6761
03:00:19,471 --> 03:00:21,340
those football doesn't go it.

6762
03:00:22,170 --> 03:00:24,750
He does a sideline
Fullerton college for Fox.

6763
03:00:24,930 --> 03:00:25,681
Uh,

6764
03:00:25,681 --> 03:00:26,370
I'm Pr,

6765
03:00:26,370 --> 03:00:27,360
don't quote me on that,

6766
03:00:27,420 --> 03:00:28,560
but he does college football.

6767
03:00:28,590 --> 03:00:29,520
I think he's really good.

6768
03:00:29,700 --> 03:00:29,851
No,

6769
03:00:29,851 --> 03:00:30,631
he's actually really,

6770
03:00:30,631 --> 03:00:31,171
really good.

6771
03:00:31,171 --> 03:00:31,471
Brian.

6772
03:00:31,471 --> 03:00:32,130
Stan is,

6773
03:00:32,130 --> 03:00:34,470
is like natural.

6774
03:00:34,530 --> 03:00:35,750
He's my favorite lunch.

6775
03:00:37,570 --> 03:00:39,150
Shouldn't pick a favorite guys dude.

6776
03:00:39,170 --> 03:00:40,003
My job

6777
03:00:41,370 --> 03:00:43,390
cause he's great and I want
to be rude to the other guys.

6778
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:44,273
Do it.

6779
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:45,451
I'll tell you right now,

6780
03:00:45,451 --> 03:00:46,500
Jimmy Smits my favorite.

6781
03:00:46,501 --> 03:00:47,020
How about that?

6782
03:00:47,020 --> 03:00:48,010
It been work for the UFC.

6783
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:51,180
He's my friend Jimmy Smith is doing
boxing now for spiking fucking great.

6784
03:00:51,340 --> 03:00:52,650
Jimmy Smits a bad motherfucker.

6785
03:00:52,890 --> 03:00:54,180
He's a cool dude too.

6786
03:00:54,270 --> 03:00:55,620
Is a good dude.

6787
03:00:55,890 --> 03:00:56,430
Yeah.

6788
03:00:56,430 --> 03:00:56,641
You know,

6789
03:00:56,641 --> 03:00:58,290
we're supposed to be
like rivals or some shit.

6790
03:00:58,310 --> 03:00:58,440
We're,

6791
03:00:58,440 --> 03:00:59,273
we're good.

6792
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:00,970
He's the nicest guy.

6793
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:01,930
He's legit.

6794
03:01:01,930 --> 03:01:03,070
Loves fighting me.

6795
03:01:03,071 --> 03:01:06,310
And that guy have sat down with no one
around and talked fighting for hours.

6796
03:01:06,760 --> 03:01:08,140
He loves fighting gloves,

6797
03:01:08,141 --> 03:01:08,891
loves MMA,

6798
03:01:08,891 --> 03:01:10,550
loves boxing because
you have a background.

6799
03:01:11,060 --> 03:01:13,510
He was a PR problem and may
fighter fought for a while.

6800
03:01:13,570 --> 03:01:13,900
Um,

6801
03:01:13,900 --> 03:01:15,220
he'd be just be chasing chambers.

6802
03:01:15,221 --> 03:01:15,321
He,

6803
03:01:15,321 --> 03:01:16,154
he looked him,

6804
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:17,590
he's blackballing Jujitsu.

6805
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:18,470
He's legit.

6806
03:01:18,470 --> 03:01:18,670
He was,

6807
03:01:18,670 --> 03:01:19,540
he was on that show.

6808
03:01:19,541 --> 03:01:21,380
Five request traveled around.

6809
03:01:21,880 --> 03:01:22,430
I mean,

6810
03:01:22,430 --> 03:01:22,880
yeah.

6811
03:01:22,880 --> 03:01:23,260
Yeah,

6812
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:24,300
that's how I know him from the show.

6813
03:01:24,880 --> 03:01:26,020
He's a legit martial arts.

6814
03:01:26,050 --> 03:01:26,920
A great commentator.

6815
03:01:26,980 --> 03:01:27,490
Yeah.

6816
03:01:27,490 --> 03:01:28,330
But he's a good dude.

6817
03:01:28,540 --> 03:01:31,600
He takes a lot of heat because we're both
bald and they think that he's copying

6818
03:01:31,601 --> 03:01:34,110
me but really are copied him first.

6819
03:01:34,120 --> 03:01:34,391
Yeah.

6820
03:01:34,391 --> 03:01:35,380
I shaved my head second.

6821
03:01:35,381 --> 03:01:36,370
He shaved his first night.

6822
03:01:36,371 --> 03:01:36,881
He was copying,

6823
03:01:36,881 --> 03:01:37,031
you know,

6824
03:01:37,031 --> 03:01:38,080
like easy bro.

6825
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:42,850
I get you want to be row
Hoodie so off copying him.

6826
03:01:44,710 --> 03:01:45,570
He's good man.

6827
03:01:45,571 --> 03:01:45,790
Yeah.

6828
03:01:45,790 --> 03:01:46,690
He never says anything.

6829
03:01:46,691 --> 03:01:47,111
I like,

6830
03:01:47,111 --> 03:01:48,510
I'll go watch this guy's crazy.

6831
03:01:48,530 --> 03:01:49,870
The guys will say things and you go,

6832
03:01:49,900 --> 03:01:50,351
um,

6833
03:01:50,351 --> 03:01:51,041
I don't know.

6834
03:01:51,041 --> 03:01:52,210
I don't think that's right.

6835
03:01:52,540 --> 03:01:52,960
You know,

6836
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:53,530
like there's,

6837
03:01:53,530 --> 03:01:54,363
there's guys that,

6838
03:01:54,730 --> 03:01:55,121
you know,

6839
03:01:55,121 --> 03:01:56,350
you hear him and other organizations,

6840
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:56,980
so you go,

6841
03:01:56,980 --> 03:01:57,900
is this all you had?

6842
03:01:57,950 --> 03:01:58,830
This is the only guy that can,

6843
03:01:59,590 --> 03:02:00,760
they don't know what's going on,

6844
03:02:00,761 --> 03:02:01,540
man.

6845
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:01,811
Guys,

6846
03:02:01,811 --> 03:02:02,830
we'll call kicks,

6847
03:02:03,290 --> 03:02:03,790
you know,

6848
03:02:03,790 --> 03:02:04,451
Spinning Hook,

6849
03:02:04,451 --> 03:02:05,081
kick to the leg.

6850
03:02:05,081 --> 03:02:07,030
Like that was not what you just saw.

6851
03:02:07,450 --> 03:02:07,700
Like,

6852
03:02:07,700 --> 03:02:08,740
you don't even know.

6853
03:02:08,741 --> 03:02:10,300
Like imagine if a head kick,

6854
03:02:10,330 --> 03:02:11,280
hey take 10 leg.

6855
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:12,760
But we got to the point now,

6856
03:02:12,761 --> 03:02:15,940
especially with all the
UFC shows where they got,

6857
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:18,910
they got professional guys and then
guys that can really do the job.

6858
03:02:18,911 --> 03:02:19,744
Like Jon Anik,

6859
03:02:20,010 --> 03:02:20,843
he's professional,

6860
03:02:20,950 --> 03:02:21,641
he's excellent,

6861
03:02:21,641 --> 03:02:22,750
but he's a sports guy.

6862
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:25,630
He calls things wrong because
the guys who don't train,

6863
03:02:25,660 --> 03:02:27,370
I mean I think Anik
might train a little bit,

6864
03:02:27,371 --> 03:02:29,410
but they just didn't call anything.

6865
03:02:29,450 --> 03:02:32,500
Like technically the Christian called
positions and they certainly shouldn't

6866
03:02:32,501 --> 03:02:35,950
call transitions or potential bats because
they know they're going to miss some

6867
03:02:35,951 --> 03:02:36,784
stuff.

6868
03:02:37,460 --> 03:02:38,350
You know why they're doing that.

6869
03:02:38,351 --> 03:02:39,640
They try to look down to chill.

6870
03:02:39,641 --> 03:02:42,460
Some guys do it because they try to
pretend that they know what they're doing.

6871
03:02:42,461 --> 03:02:43,300
And I don't mean John,

6872
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:46,080
I mean I'm really talking to
most about guys and the be leaks.

6873
03:02:46,350 --> 03:02:46,690
You know,

6874
03:02:46,690 --> 03:02:47,740
John doesn't really do that,

6875
03:02:47,741 --> 03:02:49,030
but guys who do do it,

6876
03:02:49,031 --> 03:02:51,280
it's annoying because like
I know what you're doing.

6877
03:02:51,281 --> 03:02:53,260
You're just trying to let
everybody know your knowledge.

6878
03:02:53,290 --> 03:02:53,381
Well,

6879
03:02:53,381 --> 03:02:54,161
this is what happened.

6880
03:02:54,161 --> 03:02:56,410
Is it when MMA first,

6881
03:02:56,420 --> 03:02:56,840
uh,

6882
03:02:56,840 --> 03:02:58,810
started like king of the cage,

6883
03:02:58,811 --> 03:02:59,644
for instance,

6884
03:02:59,710 --> 03:03:01,720
when I got thrown into
the commentator spot,

6885
03:03:02,710 --> 03:03:06,040
the producers didn't even
know the difference between
a play by play and a color

6886
03:03:06,041 --> 03:03:06,874
guy.

6887
03:03:07,150 --> 03:03:08,230
Most people don't really know,

6888
03:03:08,231 --> 03:03:09,400
they just hear two people talking.

6889
03:03:09,401 --> 03:03:10,630
But if you really look into it,

6890
03:03:10,870 --> 03:03:15,430
oh there's like a newscaster guy who's
holding it all together and then a color

6891
03:03:15,431 --> 03:03:20,110
guy who gets asked questions and terms
in whenever there's a professional guy

6892
03:03:20,111 --> 03:03:21,460
and a guy that just chimes in.

6893
03:03:21,790 --> 03:03:23,740
And I had to learn that the hard way,

6894
03:03:23,741 --> 03:03:24,070
man.

6895
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:27,070
And what ended up happening is in the
beginning that wasn't professional

6896
03:03:27,071 --> 03:03:29,950
broadcasters to play the
field that play by play spot.

6897
03:03:30,070 --> 03:03:33,580
So they would just take anybody and
anybody that would throw in there would do

6898
03:03:33,581 --> 03:03:34,414
color too.

6899
03:03:34,450 --> 03:03:38,110
He would be doing play by play and color
so that guys like Mike Goldberg would

6900
03:03:38,111 --> 03:03:38,950
see this and go,

6901
03:03:38,951 --> 03:03:39,700
you know what,

6902
03:03:39,700 --> 03:03:40,301
these guys,

6903
03:03:40,301 --> 03:03:43,000
these other guys are doing play
by play and a little color.

6904
03:03:43,150 --> 03:03:43,970
So my Goldberg,

6905
03:03:43,970 --> 03:03:44,140
you know,

6906
03:03:44,140 --> 03:03:46,870
he's trained kickboxing and
he think when he sees it,

6907
03:03:47,110 --> 03:03:47,590
you know,

6908
03:03:47,590 --> 03:03:48,423
he calls it right.

6909
03:03:48,530 --> 03:03:50,950
He calls the t because some
stuff and people get angry.

6910
03:03:50,951 --> 03:03:52,460
But you know Gilbert,

6911
03:03:52,461 --> 03:03:53,470
Dick Nfl.

6912
03:03:54,010 --> 03:03:54,640
Yeah.

6913
03:03:54,640 --> 03:03:55,473
I love gold.

6914
03:03:57,050 --> 03:03:57,980
He how dare

6915
03:03:57,980 --> 03:04:01,850
you not even get through the l before
you got your fucking shitting smile

6916
03:04:04,810 --> 03:04:05,930
because he got fired.

6917
03:04:06,500 --> 03:04:08,870
He started arguing with people on Twitter.

6918
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:12,110
People were saying he fucked up a couple
of things and one of them was two guys

6919
03:04:12,111 --> 03:04:12,801
at the same name.

6920
03:04:12,801 --> 03:04:13,100
Right?

6921
03:04:13,100 --> 03:04:15,560
They said the same number
of different name Adam.

6922
03:04:15,561 --> 03:04:20,200
One guy like he called one receiver
that the same number and the same name?

6923
03:04:20,210 --> 03:04:20,350
No,

6924
03:04:20,350 --> 03:04:20,541
no,

6925
03:04:20,541 --> 03:04:20,771
no,

6926
03:04:20,771 --> 03:04:20,931
no,

6927
03:04:20,931 --> 03:04:21,610
no.

6928
03:04:21,610 --> 03:04:23,600
Like a receiver for another team.

6929
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:24,840
You gotta make stop.

6930
03:04:25,010 --> 03:04:25,731
He called one team,

6931
03:04:25,731 --> 03:04:26,840
like the Detroit lions.

6932
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:28,250
Wait a minute.

6933
03:04:28,250 --> 03:04:29,800
This was a lot of freshmen.

6934
03:04:29,820 --> 03:04:30,540
I love Mike.

6935
03:04:30,540 --> 03:04:31,880
Was this his first NFL game?

6936
03:04:31,910 --> 03:04:32,480
Yes.

6937
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:33,313
And then he got fired.

6938
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:35,150
He got online.

6939
03:04:37,940 --> 03:04:41,240
You don't even know what we're talking
about it all the time on your show.

6940
03:04:41,270 --> 03:04:41,541
Yes,

6941
03:04:41,541 --> 03:04:42,011
it does it.

6942
03:04:42,011 --> 03:04:43,010
And there's only the two of you.

6943
03:04:43,011 --> 03:04:43,880
I've seen it.

6944
03:04:45,750 --> 03:04:46,550
He will be,

6945
03:04:46,550 --> 03:04:49,220
he'll be talking to you about
something and you'll say something.

6946
03:04:49,250 --> 03:04:50,050
Well No,

6947
03:04:50,050 --> 03:04:53,180
you all are talking about that first one.

6948
03:04:53,181 --> 03:04:53,991
I was Mike Goldberg Vendor.

6949
03:04:53,991 --> 03:04:54,381
You were like,

6950
03:04:54,381 --> 03:04:54,801
I was like,

6951
03:04:54,801 --> 03:04:55,940
I think talking about the rest of the,

6952
03:04:55,950 --> 03:04:57,710
why would they're talking
about commentators,

6953
03:04:57,711 --> 03:04:59,140
would they talk about little,

6954
03:05:00,450 --> 03:05:01,610
I think my goal,

6955
03:05:01,611 --> 03:05:03,140
but it is the best play by play guy.

6956
03:05:03,910 --> 03:05:07,760
A hundred percent 100% muy Thai
references and all that stuff.

6957
03:05:07,940 --> 03:05:09,230
I don't care about that shit.

6958
03:05:09,231 --> 03:05:10,064
I understand it.

6959
03:05:10,170 --> 03:05:12,500
My Goal Goldberg working
with them for eight years,

6960
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:15,530
nobody studies and prepares us ladies,

6961
03:05:15,531 --> 03:05:15,860
man,

6962
03:05:15,860 --> 03:05:18,080
he's the only guy in the
meetings and these UFC meetings.

6963
03:05:18,260 --> 03:05:20,030
He's got his laptop
out and he's got every,

6964
03:05:20,040 --> 03:05:21,080
he's ready to go.

6965
03:05:21,290 --> 03:05:22,730
He's on top of everything.

6966
03:05:22,731 --> 03:05:24,530
He rehearses all night in his room.

6967
03:05:24,830 --> 03:05:26,180
That guy is mega,

6968
03:05:26,181 --> 03:05:27,500
super ultra profession.

6969
03:05:28,190 --> 03:05:30,380
He and I have really good chemistry too.

6970
03:05:30,381 --> 03:05:31,460
I really do love that dude.

6971
03:05:31,880 --> 03:05:36,880
We've been working together for a long
time and he's seriously one on one as a

6972
03:05:37,701 --> 03:05:38,300
friend.

6973
03:05:38,300 --> 03:05:39,860
That guy's one of the sweetest guys,

6974
03:05:39,920 --> 03:05:41,480
if not the sweetest guy I've ever met.

6975
03:05:41,481 --> 03:05:42,314
Such a nice,

6976
03:05:43,020 --> 03:05:44,510
cool to everybody.

6977
03:05:44,600 --> 03:05:46,940
Nice to everybody.

6978
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:48,530
He's not a dick at all.

6979
03:05:48,800 --> 03:05:49,633
That guy's awesome.

6980
03:05:49,640 --> 03:05:51,710
I love my thinking would
have kept the NFL Gig.

6981
03:05:51,711 --> 03:05:54,110
If he didn't get on Twitter and
he was like defending himself,

6982
03:05:54,111 --> 03:05:54,890
he'd be fine.

6983
03:05:54,890 --> 03:05:58,340
Cause let's say you messed up cause
that's a lot to take on that I wasn't

6984
03:05:58,400 --> 03:06:00,950
thinking about the impact or the reach.

6985
03:06:01,190 --> 03:06:02,450
You know like you get on Twitter,

6986
03:06:02,451 --> 03:06:03,231
you know you're,

6987
03:06:03,231 --> 03:06:06,550
you're shitting on your followers
that are calling you a loser.

6988
03:06:06,600 --> 03:06:08,780
Why don't you put on the
headphones and get back there?

6989
03:06:09,020 --> 03:06:10,730
Maybe how old to drink.

6990
03:06:12,580 --> 03:06:13,520
But I've always told them,

6991
03:06:13,521 --> 03:06:14,960
we've had those conversations about,

6992
03:06:14,961 --> 03:06:15,170
you know,

6993
03:06:15,170 --> 03:06:16,490
how to deal with assholes on Twitter.

6994
03:06:16,510 --> 03:06:17,150
Mike,

6995
03:06:17,150 --> 03:06:17,720
you don't,

6996
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:18,553
don't deal with,

6997
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:19,490
we deal with them.

6998
03:06:19,491 --> 03:06:20,324
Why would you deal with them?

6999
03:06:20,450 --> 03:06:21,170
Why you vent,

7000
03:06:21,170 --> 03:06:22,400
let them enter into your life.

7001
03:06:22,810 --> 03:06:24,170
Just go more in this man.

7002
03:06:24,320 --> 03:06:25,190
And by the way,

7003
03:06:25,550 --> 03:06:28,220
the ones that hurt distinct
ones that actually sting,

7004
03:06:28,310 --> 03:06:31,220
they're probably telling you some shit
that you could use to hear and you hear

7005
03:06:31,221 --> 03:06:36,020
that and then correct your game so that
it doesn't ever possibly make any sense.

7006
03:06:36,160 --> 03:06:39,530
So that any criticism they have that's
related to what they were talking about,

7007
03:06:39,710 --> 03:06:40,680
it's illogical.

7008
03:06:40,740 --> 03:06:40,910
Right?

7009
03:06:40,910 --> 03:06:42,110
It doesn't make any sense at all.

7010
03:06:42,250 --> 03:06:43,083
You know,

7011
03:06:43,220 --> 03:06:44,150
if someone tells me,

7012
03:06:44,270 --> 03:06:44,541
you know,

7013
03:06:44,541 --> 03:06:45,141
like a,

7014
03:06:45,141 --> 03:06:45,471
you know,

7015
03:06:45,471 --> 03:06:45,741
you're,

7016
03:06:45,741 --> 03:06:46,670
you're doing commentary,

7017
03:06:46,671 --> 03:06:47,840
you don't know what the fuck is going on.

7018
03:06:47,841 --> 03:06:48,830
When the fight goes to the ground,

7019
03:06:48,831 --> 03:06:49,240
I'll go,

7020
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:49,601
ha ha,

7021
03:06:49,601 --> 03:06:50,140
that's,

7022
03:06:50,140 --> 03:06:51,260
that's adorable.

7023
03:06:52,360 --> 03:06:53,850
I'm not going to fight with them.

7024
03:06:56,160 --> 03:06:57,210
You don't want to acknowledge it.

7025
03:06:57,390 --> 03:06:58,021
You acknowledge them.

7026
03:06:58,021 --> 03:06:58,650
People go,

7027
03:06:58,650 --> 03:06:59,000
Ooh,

7028
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:02,130
Joe Rogan or Bryan County
acknowledged this negative stuff.

7029
03:07:02,131 --> 03:07:04,350
So then more than exactly
monsters come out.

7030
03:07:04,390 --> 03:07:05,550
I think we're running out of time here.

7031
03:07:05,730 --> 03:07:06,563
How much time we got.

7032
03:07:06,810 --> 03:07:07,260
That's it.

7033
03:07:07,260 --> 03:07:12,260
It's over three hours and don kids brand
and motherfucking job can be reached on

7034
03:07:13,711 --> 03:07:14,544
Twitter.

7035
03:07:14,580 --> 03:07:19,410
You can watch and listen to the fighter
and the kid where he relentlessly

7036
03:07:19,411 --> 03:07:20,340
corrects Brian

7037
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:23,660
all the time as I'm fine.

7038
03:07:23,700 --> 03:07:28,200
Often the number one sports podcast in
America because the rest of the country

7039
03:07:28,201 --> 03:07:33,201
is filled with bullshit and I got a song
to capitalizing on a nice soft spot in

7040
03:07:34,111 --> 03:07:34,944
the industry

7041
03:07:37,830 --> 03:07:39,030
and to his right.

7042
03:07:39,031 --> 03:07:39,391
Of course,

7043
03:07:39,391 --> 03:07:44,220
the great John Wayne Parr who will
be on my podcast tomorrow at noon.

7044
03:07:44,320 --> 03:07:47,190
We will talk about his
extensive Moitai career,

7045
03:07:47,191 --> 03:07:48,930
which is unparalleled.

7046
03:07:49,170 --> 03:07:49,890
One of the,

7047
03:07:49,890 --> 03:07:50,551
for real man.

7048
03:07:50,551 --> 03:07:51,330
You're one of the greats.

7049
03:07:51,330 --> 03:07:51,791
This is a,

7050
03:07:51,791 --> 03:07:53,070
I'm going to be an awesome treat.

7051
03:07:53,250 --> 03:07:56,100
We've got to get some training into think
Brendan Schaub wants to train with us

7052
03:07:56,101 --> 03:07:56,221
too,

7053
03:07:56,221 --> 03:07:58,000
and went to come down and
learn some other time on.

7054
03:07:58,020 --> 03:07:58,830
When is that?

7055
03:07:58,830 --> 03:08:00,140
Tomorrow before.

7056
03:08:00,210 --> 03:08:00,631
What are you doing,

7057
03:08:00,631 --> 03:08:00,861
bitch?

7058
03:08:00,861 --> 03:08:03,300
You got some fucking
shitty calm you have to do.

7059
03:08:03,450 --> 03:08:04,380
I know what time,

7060
03:08:05,660 --> 03:08:06,870
what time you gotta do Eliza,

7061
03:08:07,430 --> 03:08:07,740
I think.

7062
03:08:07,740 --> 03:08:07,891
Hey,

7063
03:08:07,891 --> 03:08:08,281
let's talk.

7064
03:08:08,281 --> 03:08:09,114
Let's talk later.

7065
03:08:09,540 --> 03:08:09,870
This is,

7066
03:08:09,870 --> 03:08:10,980
this thing's over Eddie Bravo.

7067
03:08:10,981 --> 03:08:13,440
You can reach Eddie Bravo
