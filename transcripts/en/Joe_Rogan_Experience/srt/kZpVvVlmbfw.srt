1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,091
Trey my day,

2
00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:03,750
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:04,950
He's uh,

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,790
he's like you said,

5
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,260
he's a straight up and figure it out.

6
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,521
What's going on with that?

7
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,130
Because I saw he posted on
Instagram that he's in big bear.

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,210
He's in big bear with his family
and just enjoying the snow.

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,391
Oh,

10
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:15,991
just chilling.

11
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:16,824
He's our trainer.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,600
I thought he was going up there to train.

13
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,653
I thought it was on.

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,640
Got a hopeful you don't
have that I know of.

15
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,540
Not that I know of,

16
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,740
but you know what they're trying to do.

17
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,903
What they're trying to do.

18
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,850
Aldo and Norma Madoff
for a fucking interim.

19
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,960
One 55 and I'm like how do you
have a one 55 interim when Connor?

20
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:35,880
Just one the one 55 a week ago.

21
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,990
What about Max though?

22
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,220
What about Max Holloway?

23
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,180
He and Max Holloway.

24
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Well he's the got the intern one 45 such
a shit show and Holloway interim cause

25
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,520
all over Nigga Murdoch is sick.

26
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,150
Sick.

27
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,481
Yeah.

28
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,200
That's a great fight.

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,033
Although versus,

30
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,550
well,

31
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,250
especially when you see what,

32
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,910
what happened with Michael Johnson.

33
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,770
Michael Johnson stunned Habib,

34
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,401
you know,

35
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,234
he stung him.

36
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,260
He hit him and stunned them.

37
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,281
And Michael Johnson,

38
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,150
with all due respect,

39
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,110
is nowhere near the striker
that Josie Aldo is Jada,

40
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,470
Josie,

41
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,740
all those on a totally different level,

42
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,250
Josie is as powerful as Johnson exposes
the question because he's not as big.

43
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,150
He's been fighting at one 45 his whole
career and he's going to be fighting a

44
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:13,260
fucking go.

45
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,260
Rilla mean they ain't no rushing go.

46
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,910
Really the difference between Johnson's
bottom game and all those bottom 100%

47
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,540
100% all those will be way better ways.

48
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:28,490
So all those kicks there a
giant factor because if you,

49
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:31,260
if all though who has
amazing takedown defense,

50
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,610
fucking amazing,

51
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,770
some of the best take down defense.

52
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,760
So he's also gotten
fucking nasty lick kicks.

53
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,980
So if number come in off moves at him.

54
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,121
What is this?

55
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:42,611
Who is this?

56
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:43,000
Who is this?

57
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,470
Will you show me here how beam number
coming off slams UFC for lying to the fans

58
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,010
about Josie?

59
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,920
Aldo demands relevant fight against her.

60
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,970
Why is he saying he's lying to the fans?

61
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,530
Let's see.

62
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,363
Let's see what he says here.

63
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,350
I'll come back on this.

64
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:55,890
This God damn screen dude.

65
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:56,671
Uh,

66
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:59,490
it's clear to everyone that
you hiding Connor from me,

67
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,740
but stop lying to your fans.

68
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,660
Like I don't want fight with Aldo.

69
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,610
I'm ready to fight with
anyone in my division.

70
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,490
Give me relevant fight so
you won't preserve all.

71
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,560
Take your phone away from
your sister cause somebody,

72
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,730
somebody got this phone then making no,

73
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,910
he's definitely doing it.

74
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,990
Do you think he's right in broke
even though she's sell routes,

75
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:16,824
but I love it.

76
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,120
It makes it more gangster.

77
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,421
Okay.

78
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,590
You've never matched up.

79
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:19,891
What does it,

80
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:20,790
I can't see that Jamie,

81
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,451
this thing is in front of it.

82
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:21,571
Oh,

83
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:25,680
he never matched up two guys with
the nine and eight win streak in UFC.

84
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:26,880
Never in UFC history.

85
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,960
Oh,

86
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,450
okay.

87
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,440
That doesn't mean anything.

88
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:28,861
See,

89
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,920
here's the problem is too expensive.

90
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,970
I see what he's saying,

91
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,380
but let me explain why he's wrong.

92
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,910
They need big relevant
fights to sell paper views.

93
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,061
Right?

94
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:39,894
And that's all they care about.

95
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,763
Here's the deal.

96
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,800
The UFC was purchased for $4 billion.

97
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,100
Bill,

98
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,750
imagine if you bought a,

99
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
I mean you have,

100
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,550
you own a place,

101
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:50,970
right?

102
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,803
You own your house.

103
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,830
You know what a mortgages,

104
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,480
mortgages are pretty conti.

105
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,560
You'll look at them every month.

106
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:55,771
He'd go,

107
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,604
Jesus,

108
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,520
you know now if you have a mortgage for
a nice house and you spend 1 million

109
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,140
bucks as a fucking nut,

110
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,100
you've got to make every month,

111
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,311
man,

112
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,240
you've got to think about it.

113
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,661
You've got to go,

114
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:04,931
okay,

115
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,430
we've got the mortgage is covered.

116
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:06,761
All right?

117
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,230
And then you move on
with all the other bills.

118
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:08,951
Write me about it.

119
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:12,460
So then June a $4 billion house,

120
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,730
what kind of fucking mortgage and how do
we pay the bills by doing huge fights?

121
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,031
Huge.

122
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,500
So we got to figure some shit out.

123
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,100
Interim,

124
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,491
interim,

125
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:21,850
interim,

126
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,740
everybody in the belt.

127
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,130
The reality is John Jones is suspended
and Jon Jones isn't even the champ right

128
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:27,580
now.

129
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,510
So when he comes back,

130
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:32,080
he's not even fighting for a world title
and less he fights for the world title.

131
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,910
So you got to have DC has gotta be healthy
or you got to have John Fight for an

132
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:40,630
interim because they're just throwing
interims out like they're fucking fliers

133
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,720
that they put on your car when a dude's
trying to like sell car washes and my

134
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:46,570
brother,

135
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,200
if they don't start getting
these fucking cars selling,

136
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,170
they've got to be another season to
fifth factor is going to be added on.

137
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:52,720
No,

138
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,290
there's not.

139
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,471
No,

140
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:57,170
there's not even a CCM [inaudible]
some Brad pitch just to sell papers.

141
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,350
These are some shit up you something Doug.

142
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,640
I don't know what they're going to do.

143
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,391
You know,

144
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,860
who knows if I'll be there for it.

145
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,540
But when you look at,

146
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,130
when you look at like the,

147
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,970
the,

148
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,301
the,

149
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,440
the title picture,

150
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,410
who like that card that
they have in Brooklyn,

151
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,520
I mean that is,

152
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,610
that's a paper view card and it
looks like an fs one car right now.

153
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,870
I'm sure they're going to juice it up.

154
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,913
They'll get more,

155
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,080
but it's going to be a die hard fan.

156
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,820
Pay 60 bucks for that shit.

157
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,420
It's hard.

158
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,530
It's hard to make those cards.

159
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,310
So we,

160
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,040
I think we kind of nailed it when
we were talking about it earlier,

161
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,380
like what guys sell paper views.

162
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,890
I think Woodley's a bigger star
now that he'd be Wonderboy,

163
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:34,370
but he still wants that a paper,

164
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,490
like Dana and I were
having this conversation.

165
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,701
He's like,

166
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,690
you can't have Nick Diaz.

167
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:37,871
He goes,

168
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:38,351
nick and says,

169
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:42,340
I don't want to fight since 2011 he can't
have him step in and just go right up

170
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,174
to the title and tell.

171
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,560
That's what I said.

172
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:44,891
I said,

173
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,760
but I want to see it,

174
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,241
and he goes,

175
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:46,901
I want to see it too.

176
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,291
But you can't.

177
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,124
You can't sell it.

178
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,820
Well you will.

179
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,290
No one's going to take the sports series.

180
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,070
If you give a guy who hasn't won since
2011 or 12 give him a title shot.

181
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:54,761
People at fancy.

182
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:54,971
I'm like,

183
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,804
come on Bro.

184
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,760
But I think they missed the boat if they
wanted to make the fucking big money.

185
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,300
It's Nick Diaz versus Conor
McGregor is too big brother.

186
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,000
He's trying to fight at one seven come on.

187
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,211
No,

188
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,490
his [inaudible] his brother
was too big for him.

189
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,290
He's too big,

190
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:11,980
way too big.

191
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,910
I think that talk is nonsense because
Connor is the one 55 pound champ.

192
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,490
Nate fought at one 55 most of his career.

193
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,470
He fought at one 70 a couple
of times and he's undersized.

194
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,950
Don Young can beat him at one 70 he's a,

195
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,290
he's a legit one 70 or though,

196
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,220
especially Donald,

197
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:29,210
he's even won 70 maybe,

198
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,230
but he fights one 55 easy look great
against Michael MacDonald at 55 Tyron

199
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,313
Woodley,

200
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,850
if his fucking life depends on it,

201
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:41,800
Tyron Woodley is not gonna make it 55 so
the naming the champ can't make one 55

202
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,520
at one 70 Nate can.

203
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:45,520
So Nate is not a real one.

204
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,960
79 here's to your point,

205
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:47,681
in Dana's point,

206
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,700
he doesn't want to fight since 2011
and you don't have common your cash cow

207
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,031
fight.

208
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,490
This monster hasn't one forever talk.

209
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,720
Great Story.

210
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,521
It really is.

211
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:57,354
I love it.

212
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,540
Big Brother's steps in cut my,

213
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,463
I would watch it,

214
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,670
I'd watch him in,

215
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,180
but to your,

216
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,751
to your point,

217
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,030
they have to figure something
out to get these stars.

218
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,800
It doesn't matter because
you can't do it overnight.

219
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,641
To me it doesn't matter.

220
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,070
You put Nick Diaz for what
he's done out of respect.

221
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,000
Who's going to complain?

222
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,210
Right.

223
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,320
Well apparently they thought for it.

224
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:12,861
Nick Diaz,

225
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,730
Robbie Lawler and uh,

226
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,770
nick passed on it.

227
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,663
That's the word.

228
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,260
That's the word behind the scenes.

229
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,123
Interesting.

230
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,090
Maybe I'm not supposed to say that,

231
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,931
but uh,

232
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:21,920
I wanted to see that fight.

233
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,420
I would love to see that rematch.

234
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,490
But I think nick wants
a fucking title fight.

235
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:25,941
You know,

236
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:26,870
I think nick is like,

237
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,021
look,

238
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,591
I want a big,

239
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,790
big name or a title fight.

240
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,280
I love how they make these demands.

241
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,143
Scam money.

242
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,450
Make Nick made some money.

243
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,740
He's not ridiculous.

244
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,670
He doesn't spend it all.

245
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:34,791
Well,

246
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,380
how about Nate?

247
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,670
I'm not,

248
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm not answering the call.

249
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:37,850
And this is 20 million.

250
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:38,571
Yeah,

251
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:39,404
we talked about,

252
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
we talked about that
recently in the podcast,

253
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:41,901
so I was like,

254
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,021
well,

255
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:43,580
let's break this down because like,

256
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,800
let's say they do a
million pay per view buys,

257
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,030
which is like top end,

258
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,240
right?

259
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,980
There's only a few people
that have ever sold a million.

260
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,814
It's like Brock,

261
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
Rhonda Conner sit.

262
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,580
It's okay.

263
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,930
1 million is top of the food chain,

264
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,740
so a million pay per
view buys at 60 bucks.

265
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,110
That's you're taking one
third right off the bat.

266
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:00,530
For Nate,

267
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,180
it's really hard to justify giving
someone $20 million for something.

268
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,850
I don't do that.

269
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,930
It's going to be real hard and then
obviously on or could demand that Connor's

270
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,660
like one of the only guys that
can get that kind of money.

271
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,570
He's the only one of you guys you think
eventually guys would just start doing,

272
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,040
I think it's so big like Connor,

273
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,350
he just does his own show
and and he gets his own.

274
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,280
People know the EOC.

275
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,360
Lawyers are too good to let
you get out of your contract.

276
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,980
They realize that if,

277
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,380
if Nate had a legit fight with
someone other than Connor,

278
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,280
that was exciting.

279
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,640
The problem is there's no one else in
the division that's got that kind of

280
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,600
marquee value.

281
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,580
55 yeah.

282
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,280
It was no one in the division that has
the kind of marquee value that if you had

283
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,190
a look,

284
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,380
I think Nate is a fucking huge star,

285
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,370
but in less than,

286
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,390
especially now.

287
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:41,631
I mean,

288
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:42,351
after he beat Conor,

289
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:46,460
he's one of the biggest stars outside
of that upper echelon paper view,

290
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,323
like level.

291
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,020
And he's,

292
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,900
but he's not a world
title holder right now.

293
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,690
So if you wanted to really
have a big fight for Nate,

294
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,160
I would have to have him that would work.

295
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,030
Fight all day.

296
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,800
I would work.

297
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,633
That would work

298
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,530
[inaudible].
