1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,400
Me,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,261
as we prayed,

3
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:10,400
sadness that I tell you that this Joe
Rogan experience is not brought to you by

4
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:11,234
the fleshlight.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,460
We've come to the end of our long road
with the flashlight and they've been.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,140
They were the first sponsor ever on
the Joe Rogan experience podcast and we

7
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,370
appreciate the fuck out of that.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,040
They took a chance when
we were on a laptop,

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,690
what snowflakes in the background,

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,520
and we did two hard years together
and we hope to really hard years.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,090
We hope that we sold you
a lot of fake pussies.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,620
That's what we sincerely hope.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,630
We hope that our relationship
was profitable and we
just want to say that you

14
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:46,631
guys are cool as fuck and we enjoyed
working with you and best of luck and all

15
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:51,470
you do with your rubber pussies in the
future if you have a solid product.

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,860
And it was an honor to represent you to
the field of battle sharing this moment

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,461
of silence real quick.

18
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,150
Okay.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,560
Do what?

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,640
What mobile ready?

21
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,241
Okay.

22
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,074
We're good.

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,591
We're,

24
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:06,190
uh,

25
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,820
we're not sponsored by alienware.

26
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,820
People keep asking because
we changed the laptops.

27
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:14,821
We only are doing this because I think
it's a good idea to support companies who

28
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:20,941
support mma and alien ware to
stepped up and they them and Dell.

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,990
That's a big deal.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,350
When a company like alienware
start sponsoring fighters.

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,290
I mean when I see that alien
logo on fighters shorts,

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,101
that's a big deal.

33
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:30,341
To me.

34
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,900
It's like that's a big fucking company.

35
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:33,820
Like an Anderson Silva was burger king.

36
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:34,720
I don't eat burger king,

37
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:35,890
but if I was going to eat burger king,

38
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,110
I would eat burger king because
they sponsored Anderson Silva.

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,330
Not that Andersen needs it as much as
like mma gets a lot of these fighters,

40
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,200
what they get in,

41
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,363
how they get

42
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,840
money for training and to pay for.

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,850
It's not just their
salaries from fighting,

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,230
it's from their sponsors.

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,300
So if you see young guys
and they're fighting,

46
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:55,470
you know,

47
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,250
for 10,000 bucks or whatever it is,

48
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:57,670
it's not.

49
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,940
You don't get paid a lot of money
when nobody knows who you are.

50
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:01,800
You get paid a lot of money
when you can sell tickets.

51
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,990
But what keeps these young guys going is,

52
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,520
especially companies like alienware,

53
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,150
like really high profile companies,

54
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,460
when they start putting
the logos on your shorts,

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,473
that's.

56
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,630
That means that there's a
big company that's invested,

57
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,280
there's a big company
and it's stepping up.

58
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,730
I think that should be rewarded and that's
why we decided to do this and we're,

59
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,870
we're working with sucker
punch entertainment and
alienware MMA and they hooked

60
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:31,400
us up with some laptops and we're trying
to support a company that supports mma.

61
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,220
And by the way,

62
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,510
these are not cheap laptops.

63
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:34,590
They're fucking expensive,

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,820
but they kick some serious ass if
you want to play games on laptops,

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,391
these things,

66
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,110
the shit.

67
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,741
And people are like,

68
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:42,060
well you can make yourself for cheaper.

69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,050
I maybe you could make a laptop,

70
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,680
I don't know how you could buy shells
for laptops and you can kind of do it,

71
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:52,890
but you're not going to make a fucking
alien if you can afford it though.

72
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,970
They are the shit.

73
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,670
I mean these,

74
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,440
the frame rates and these
things are ridiculous.

75
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:56,730
So you know,

76
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,870
you watch full resolution on these things,

77
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:01,540
but they're very fun when I'm using it.

78
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,650
Even Three d,

79
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,240
which is a fucking trip
when you're really,

80
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,051
really baked in,

81
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,150
you want to play some games
in three D in your bed.

82
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,360
Yeah,

83
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,040
it's,

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,320
it's a very solid gaming
laptop and we support them.

85
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,370
We support a alienware period for nothing
for free or sort of sort of free shit

86
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,550
and laptops.

87
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,490
Get a little money out of it.

88
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,290
So,

89
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:20,590
uh,

90
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,600
we are also sponsored
by [inaudible] dot com.

91
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,860
That's o n n I t,

92
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,180
makers of Alpha brain.

93
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,100
I haven't even mind yet.

94
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,461
Fuck.

95
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,540
I'm getting insecure now.

96
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,570
Did you hear that on it?

97
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,530
Rattle snake.

98
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,990
Is that the onnit rattlesnake?

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,030
I'm Scott.

100
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,990
My battle rope.

101
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,110
Just got battle ropes in the mail.

102
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,060
It'll tell me some of the time.

103
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,860
Your brain time to get
caveman style in the backyard.

104
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,810
Scare the neighbors,

105
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:44,644
you know,

106
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,663
bitches know.

107
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,061
Yeah.

108
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,660
When you hear your neighbor to
kettlebells in the backyard here,

109
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,420
that's dude like you
probably not gonna wanna.

110
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,273
Invite that guy.

111
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,153
Barbecue.

112
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,543
Fucking Weirdo.

113
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,890
Especially human noise.

114
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,160
You make me uncomfortable.

115
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,440
Like when we go work out together,

116
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,610
if you look,

117
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,870
if you're working out correctly,

118
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,980
it's really hard,

119
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,701
you know,

120
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,900
you gotta work out to the point where
your body's failing to with a ball gag in

121
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:11,770
her mouth and they basically
have something like that.

122
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,040
They have this thing called the training
mask and a Bas rutten has one called

123
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,874
the boss.

124
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,280
I think it's the boss.

125
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:17,860
Oh,

126
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,693
something or another.

127
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,870
And it's um,

128
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,190
you breathe through it
and it restricts your air.

129
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,800
It gives you like tiny
air holes to breathe,

130
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:24,101
right?

131
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:24,341
Yeah,

132
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:24,731
I remember that.

133
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:24,890
Yeah.

134
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,070
Bas rutten's sits in
your mouth kind of crazy,

135
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,840
like this big giant mouthpiece and,

136
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,350
but the,

137
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,671
the,

138
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,000
the other one,

139
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,580
the elevation mask is like,

140
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,560
it's got like little hoses on it and shit.

141
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,870
And when boss routines and
very controversial by the way,

142
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,900
scientifically not really
supported it's support,

143
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,690
it's not really supported that that
improves your oxygen and it doesn't,

144
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:45,280
it certainly doesn't do.

145
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,500
So.

146
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,770
Taking capacity out
training at altitude does,

147
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,010
which training it to does is you live
in a place and you stay overnight and

148
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,260
sleep in a place where
there's a very high altitude,

149
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,220
very low oxygen,

150
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,090
your body naturally overproduces red
blood cells to compensate for the lack of

151
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:58,900
oxygen.

152
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,780
That doesn't mean that when
you restrict your oxygen,

153
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,760
your body makes more red blood cells.

154
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,990
It just means it's harder to breathe.

155
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,411
I mean,

156
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,240
it's kind of a better workout,

157
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:10,510
but it's also kind of not a better workout
because you're not able to work out

158
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,280
as hard because you can't breathe as hard,

159
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:12,821
you know,

160
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,980
so unless you're an
absolutely perfect shape,

161
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,230
the benefit of it is probably negligible.

162
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,780
I don't know what the fuck
this has to do with anything,

163
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,933
but uh,

164
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,180
that's why wouldn't work out with a ball
gag that would love to hear you like

165
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:27,760
doing your [inaudible].

166
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,130
Like when you don't have a ball
gag in and you're working out,

167
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:33,850
it sounds sexual sounds really intense.

168
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,410
No to everybody in the gym,

169
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,000
like girls are like fucking like,

170
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,451
listen,

171
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:37,790
son.

172
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,550
Pushing out to the elliptical.

173
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,570
If you're going to do it,

174
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,290
you should do it.

175
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,621
Guys are.

176
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:42,311
If you're going to do it,

177
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:42,851
you should actually.

178
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,990
I know I can't actually.

179
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't want to have a
halfassed workout ever.

180
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,591
I don't.

181
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:47,901
I don't.

182
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,060
I don't believe in those.

183
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,320
I think if you're going to work out,

184
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,041
you should work out.

185
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,611
If you got to work out,

186
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,570
you gonna make some noise.

187
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,010
Yeah.

188
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,710
It'll be scared.

189
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,020
It sounds very grapey.

190
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,490
It was planet fitness places.

191
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,500
Those are the worst where
you're not allowed to Moan.

192
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Have you seen those places?

193
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,340
Oh yeah.

194
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,481
Yeah.

195
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:02,701
You're.

196
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:04,340
You're literally not around the grunt.

197
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,203
We don't take.

198
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,430
They call you a meathead
if you grunt tool.

199
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,140
Right?

200
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,800
Like if it wasn't sexual sounds,

201
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,030
it would not be illegal.

202
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:14,480
Bunch of Limp Dick dudes that
don't want guys to get too strong.

203
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,710
That is this some weird fucking
gyms for insecure people?

204
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:18,950
Yeah.

205
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,000
Like you don't want to.

206
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,200
It's one thing.

207
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,530
There are dudes that go way too crazy.

208
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,850
This guys who use it know
where they get together,

209
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,410
quotes,

210
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:28,760
quotes,

211
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,320
quotes,

212
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,153
go

213
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,300
this guys at the gym where
it becomes uncomfortable.

214
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:34,401
Like,

215
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,540
come on you bitches.

216
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,750
What do you do that you just make loud
sexual noises that echo out throughout 24

217
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:41,800
hours.

218
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,830
If you're going to deadlift,

219
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,630
you should be making some fucking noise.

220
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,471
Do you guys still yell?

221
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,304
Lightweight.

222
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,971
Lightweight.

223
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,710
Now what does that Ronnie Coleman,

224
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,990
Ronnie Coleman used to yell out.

225
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:51,824
Lightweight,

226
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,510
lightweight.

227
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,840
I used to hear that Shit in the gym.

228
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,674
It was noisy.

229
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,560
I don't understand it like that was what
he would say to psych himself up for a

230
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:57,970
big lift.

231
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,620
Like,

232
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,240
oh the.

233
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,470
Oh,

234
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,490
the guys in the gym.

235
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,590
All these Ronnie Coleman
wannabes chanting that.

236
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,560
That guy was so big when he was big.

237
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,960
Jesus Christ was Ronnie Coleman big.

238
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,640
He was big like what?

239
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,810
He was a cop.

240
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,641
He was doing it.

241
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,290
That was the really nuts shit about that.

242
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,880
Can you Mr. Olympia Guy,

243
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,150
he was so fucking big.

244
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,650
Jesus Christ.

245
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:22,580
That guy was huge.

246
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,240
He had a big smile and I can
imagine being pulled over by him.

247
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:30,650
You see that and I bet he was
a decent officer a lot anymore.

248
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,250
He got all his aggressions out
in the gym to get that big.

249
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,320
You have to work out so fucking hard.

250
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,310
I don't care what you're taking does,

251
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,500
it doesn't just make you grow.

252
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,770
Like that guy is working out really hard.

253
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,590
There's something going
on outside of steroids.

254
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,300
There's a lot of hard work there,

255
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,190
so he was probably tired all
the time to smile and know.

256
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,300
Always constantly.

257
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,650
If you're built like the hulk,

258
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,040
you know much fucking cowards.

259
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,590
You have to scarf down and just to stay,

260
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,320
stay afloat anyway.

261
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,030
What brought to you by the fuck you doing
brought to you by [inaudible] dot com.

262
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,700
A makers of Alpha brain
and as we were saying,

263
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,080
I just got the battle ropes in the mail.

264
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,340
Kettlebells are in,

265
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,080
if you haven't used kettlebells to work
out is my personal favorite exercise and

266
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:17,360
someone corrected me on my
message board there actually.

267
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:17,810
Right?

268
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,381
They said that.

269
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:21,710
I always say that a bench
presses and isolation exercise.

270
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,611
It does work.

271
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:23,630
A bunch of different muscle groups.

272
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:23,781
When,

273
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,830
I mean is it sort of.

274
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,330
It's an unnatural sort of a thing to
just be doing this and what I like about

275
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:32,780
kettlebells is that it requires
you to use your whole body.

276
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,680
I mean,

277
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,910
when you bench press,

278
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,230
I guess you could push off the ground
with your feet and it does have some sort

279
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:39,651
of impact.

280
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,910
Suddenly I'm against bench press.

281
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,300
I mean I still do conventional
weightlifting to occasionally,

282
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,760
but I think that for me personally,

283
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,270
the,

284
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:47,780
the.

285
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,840
If I had one piece of workout
equipment that I would choose to use,

286
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,380
it will be the Kettlebell because you can
get an amazing workout with a 30 pound

287
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,880
Kettlebell.

288
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,880
I mean just break your body down and
credit the kind of endurance strain that's

289
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:01,630
like,

290
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,780
like training Jujitsu,

291
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:04,140
like when someone's
trying to strangle you,

292
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,140
like it's the only thing that comes
close to making you that hard.

293
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,010
It's an incredible workout and just a
35 pound Kettlebell and it strengthens

294
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:11,611
your whole body,

295
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,690
strengthens your core,

296
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:13,291
your abs,

297
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:13,950
your legs,

298
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,240
and you really don't.

299
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,530
It's not that difficult to like
formulate a workout program.

300
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,890
You can go look at some of
them that are on Youtube.

301
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,870
There's a bunch of guys who
have great dvds out there.

302
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,490
Mike Mauler is a great one.

303
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,960
He's got a great DVD.

304
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,430
My friend Steve Maxwell,

305
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,170
fantastic dvds out there.

306
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,270
There's always workouts that you can
find and you can watch a DVD and follow

307
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:39,690
along with it and literally getting
the best fucking shape of your life.

308
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,080
They're amazing for for like
actual physical usable strength.

309
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,820
Like if you do anything that requires
physical strength and you do kettle bells,

310
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,511
it'll make it better.

311
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,470
It's really incredible.

312
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:57,180
It just makes your body just stronger
as a unit as opposed to like say like

313
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,260
bicep curls.

314
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,090
That would be a true isolation exercise.

315
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,710
Something that's really unnatural where
you just only really using the biceps

316
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,960
and maybe a little bit of
the forums like he bought.

317
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,340
He doesn't really want to move like that.

318
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,320
Your body wants to pick things up and
move as a unit and that in my opinion,

319
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,110
is the best way for fitness
to get your body stronger,

320
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,470
to do full body exercises
like Turkish getups.

321
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,500
I mean they're not as
romantic as bicep curls,

322
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,110
man.

323
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,741
It is true.

324
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,680
It's like bicep curls or sex.

325
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,480
Why he screams and moans
about it yet and that's why

326
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,580
it gets wet.

327
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:32,940
You know,

328
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,110
there's something sexy about it.

329
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,300
There's something sexy about a.

330
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,260
because if a guy's just working as buys,

331
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,520
always trying to do is look good.

332
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,370
Every man in the gym is having
an emotional experience.

333
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,420
Some level.

334
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,840
Yes.

335
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,110
That's why I will not do.

336
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,631
If you do it right,

337
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,890
you've got to get really uncomfortable,

338
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:47,710
man.

339
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,210
Do it right.

340
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,200
You've got to feel like shit.

341
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,440
Oh by my favorite way to feel
like shit is with kettlebells.

342
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,251
It feels like shit.

343
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,480
And then I feel awesome afterwards.

344
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,670
That and a Hindu squats.

345
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,960
A lot of you've been saying,

346
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,280
you've been sending tweets about that.

347
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,440
You started doing the Hindu squats
and what a big difference it makes.

348
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,090
It's fucking incredible.

349
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,920
It's one of the best exercises you can do.

350
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,210
You don't need a gym,

351
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:06,991
Hindu squats.

352
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:10,980
I do 200 of them before I do any
workout and I am feel like stopping.

353
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,180
I feel like I'm done at just
200 squats with no weight.

354
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,370
You would think there's no
way that's going to be easy.

355
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,061
That's so easy.

356
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:18,894
It's not.

357
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,380
It's fucking hard and it
gets hard at around like 60,

358
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,390
like around 60 like shit.

359
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,270
And then you're in a seven and then you
hit a hundred and you're like another

360
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,410
100 of these bitches.

361
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,390
It's fucking great to do and it's
not like a high weight exercise.

362
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:37,260
It develops your leg strength without
really putting yourself in a precarious

363
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,730
positions with weights on your back.

364
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,400
So it's a good way to start a base of,

365
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:41,551
uh,

366
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,420
of training as well.

367
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:43,060
And so like if you,

368
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,010
if you're not really a guy,

369
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:45,510
works out at all and you're thinking,

370
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,344
man,

371
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,370
I want to get in shape,

372
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,121
don't go crazy.

373
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,530
And just immediately start doing squats.

374
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:53,080
Our friend Kevin Pereira was
in here yesterday and he's
all fucked up because of

375
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,150
that very reason because
he didn't work out.

376
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,180
And then all of a sudden he was doing
crazy fucking power lifts three times a

377
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,014
day.

378
00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,680
Anyway,

379
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,210
point is go to [inaudible] dot com.

380
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,530
This is our only sponsor.

381
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:06,600
We'll have one sponsor
now on it is the spa.

382
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,830
We only have one sponsor.

383
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:10,390
He has still managed to have a
15 fucking minutes commercial.

384
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,590
Three dream sponsors.

385
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,120
What would your three dream sponsors be?

386
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,550
We'd have to think about that.

387
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,593
Let's think about that,

388
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,201
Jack Daniels,

389
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:17,650
number one,

390
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,160
that would be to have to evolve from
the flashlight to the real doll,

391
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:21,994
don't you?

392
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,650
It's not evolution.

393
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,110
The real deal is creepy
as fuck the fleshlight.

394
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,430
You just putting something over your Dick.

395
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,481
The real dollars.

396
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,830
You're pretending that a woman.

397
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,790
Isn't that a relative?

398
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,600
Creepiness?

399
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,150
Yes,

400
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,983
totally relevant,

401
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,400
but the actual fiber of
the fleshlight is superior.

402
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,121
Supposedly.

403
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,530
I shouldn't say fiber texture.

404
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:38,710
Yeah,

405
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,710
but have you ever used a Jack
Daniels bottle as a flashlight?

406
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,510
My Dick is way too big for that now.

407
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,010
Now if you break it off at the end,

408
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,250
the fuck praying,

409
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,330
you're making no sense.

410
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,750
Ain't gonna make me end this commercial.

411
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,980
If data is your strategy,

412
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:51,340
yes,

413
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,173
it's over.

414
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,310
Go to [inaudible] dot com.

415
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,121
Use the code name,

416
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,500
Rogan and save yourself
10 percent off any.

417
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,320
The supplements.

418
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,870
The kettlebells had been selling like
crazy and the positive results that I'm

419
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,540
getting from people who really enjoyed
the workouts on twitter that are coming

420
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,081
in like crazy too.

421
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,130
I thank you very much.

422
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,150
I don't get behind anything unless
I 100 percent believe in it.

423
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,493
Even the flashlight,

424
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,490
if you want to beat off,

425
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,270
that's better.

426
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,840
Okay,

427
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,130
but with onnit.com,

428
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:15,911
everything we sell,

429
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:16,840
especially the supplements,

430
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:17,830
the first 30 pills,

431
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,750
there was a 100 percent
money back guarantee.

432
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,890
You don't have to return anything.

433
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:24,100
Just say this shit is not for
me and you get your money back.

434
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,040
We're that confident that one we're
selling you something that you're going to

435
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,170
enjoy and it's going to help you and to.

436
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,730
I don't want anybody to feel ripped off,

437
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,151
period.

438
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:36,151
I'm way more concerned about having people
feel like this is a even transaction

439
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,000
and this is a good deal for them
than I am about making money.

440
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,470
Use the codename Brogan.

441
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,240
Save 10 percent off any supplements.

442
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,501
Your last name,

443
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:45,780
I pronounce it coke cash,

444
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,360
right?

445
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,670
I don't want to fuck this up as
long as you don't say Kokesh.

446
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,020
I wouldn't say that to coke.

447
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,123
Coke,

448
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:51,611
coke,

449
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:52,720
cash is here.

450
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,860
Ladies and gentlemen.

451
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,680
Just fucking man.

452
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,610
We're going to get down
to the nitty gritty.

453
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,560
We're going to figure some shit out.

454
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,840
Maybe I'm not on a problem.

455
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,500
We will.

456
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,160
I am.

457
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,400
Okay.

458
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,233
He's promising.

459
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,913
Play the music.

460
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,213
No.

461
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,420
Joe Rogan experience

462
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,820
Joe Rogan podcast.

463
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,670
Thank you fred.

464
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,503
During that commercial,

465
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,410
you know you were here for a very

466
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,150
emotional moment for us.

467
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:25,690
The last,

468
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,291
the flashlight.

469
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,124
I understand sir,

470
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,860
and I'm glad we got through that together.

471
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,640
I understand that deep
emotional connection you can
have with masturbatory aids.

472
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,370
Absolutely.

473
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,111
It's not that.

474
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:40,111
It's that they paid us that was deep
emotional and it's a solid product,

475
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,321
you know,

476
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,000
controversial but a solid product.

477
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,010
You can totally pull back
your microphone also.

478
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,070
It stretches out reaching.

479
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,780
Yeah.

480
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,231
Yeah.

481
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,070
That's part of what we're
kind of a street like

482
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,860
that.

483
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,130
A little bit underground tributing.

484
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,770
If I do it like a poignant moments,

485
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,781
people know.

486
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:00,140
Man,

487
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,700
that was a real microphone cord there.

488
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,500
You asked what was actually happening.

489
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,370
It's the cat clock.

490
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,000
You think they like to
count snowflake mentality.

491
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,660
You think people like the cat clock
really makes it sound less professional.

492
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:11,811
You know,

493
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,640
people think it's like a studio and stuff.

494
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:14,474
It's crazy like that.

495
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,870
Yeah,

496
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,140
but that clock does interrupt
your thought process for a second.

497
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,070
First second,

498
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,903
maybe not.

499
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,860
Maybe it makes you up to how retarded
you or you're fucking cat clock.

500
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:26,690
The clock me out every time the the,

501
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:27,524
our changes.

502
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,330
More twitter followers are
intuitive twitter than most
people have blocked does.

503
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,820
I didn't even know there was a catalog.

504
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,893
Yeah,

505
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,990
I think it's red bands.

506
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,580
Cat clock and it just,

507
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:38,800
it always is like,

508
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,261
it's always like,

509
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:39,651
Joe,

510
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,790
why are you so mean to me?

511
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,790
Or this is why I have
faith in the Internet.

512
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:44,960
Oh,

513
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,730
the Internet is the
ultimate balancing act,

514
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:47,230
isn't it?

515
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,900
Yeah.

516
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,591
That's how we met,

517
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:48,771
man.

518
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:48,981
Dude,

519
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,660
you have a hat with your own name on it.

520
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,010
I know it's kind of sticker with
your own name on it like you are.

521
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,070
You are 100 percent dedicated to you.

522
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,321
Yeah.

523
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,310
Well I,

524
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,300
I stopped short it wearing the t shirt
usually because that's a little creepy.

525
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,600
Is the t shirt and a hat together?

526
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,250
Oh yeah.

527
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,460
No,

528
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,211
that doesn't happen,

529
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:08,200
but dice clay was onstage at the Riviera
and Vegas this weekend and he had a

530
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,140
dice shirt on.

531
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,200
It was perfect and then
he sells that shirt.

532
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,041
It's just,

533
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,130
it just says dice and
the eye is like a dice,

534
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,650
you know,

535
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,750
like a dice cube.

536
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,950
So you were a good company with a hat,

537
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:22,640
with your name on it.

538
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,473
Thank you.

539
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,891
So,

540
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:25,370
um,

541
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,600
how long have you been doing this show,

542
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:27,620
Adam versus demand?

543
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:27,921
Well,

544
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:32,870
that's a good question because I got to
go way back to just even explain how I

545
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:36,500
started to stumble into this
now and explain to people
to explain to people what

546
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,011
your show is,

547
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:39,620
where people have never heard it's
Adam versus the [inaudible] dot com.

548
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,600
I do a daily podcast except when I'm,

549
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,331
when I'm traveling.

550
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:45,640
Like I haven't been so much recently but
I didn't want in Denver the other day,

551
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,470
but I normally do it out of my
apartment in northern Virginia.

552
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:51,160
So I'm inside the
beltway in Washington DC.

553
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,150
I feel like I'm dancing around the feet
of the Leviathan there and I'm able,

554
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:57,560
I'm able to poke the man.

555
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,390
I'm able to poke the machine there,

556
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,291
but I really,

557
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,250
I really hate living there.

558
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:01,361
It's,

559
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:02,540
it's really weird.

560
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,020
But I do my show out of my apartment
there and I do a youtube channel,

561
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,310
youtube.com/Adam,

562
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:07,910
Kokesh,

563
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,151
k o,

564
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,200
k e s h,

565
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,700
and I,

566
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,331
I just,

567
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:11,750
I,

568
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,160
none of what I do is work anymore.

569
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,040
I absolutely love it.

570
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:14,240
It.

571
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,440
And,

572
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,930
and I'm,

573
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm obsessed with what I do.

574
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:18,140
I am absolutely committed and
driven and passionate about it.

575
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:18,801
I,

576
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:19,080
you know,

577
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,161
I,

578
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:19,971
I have,

579
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,910
I have to smoke weed to
slow me down if anything,

580
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:26,600
but I always do my podcasts over every
morning and we post highlights from that

581
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:27,434
to youtube.

582
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,910
But I started my activism
way back in college.

583
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,040
Libertarians in,

584
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,770
in Claremont,

585
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,790
not too far from here,

586
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,251
uh,

587
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:36,320
was at Claremont Mckenna.

588
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,251
And I didn't,

589
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,061
I didn't really get it.

590
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:38,301
To me,

591
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,500
libertarian was,

592
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,111
well,

593
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm not going to be a republican or
a Democrat because that Shit's lame,

594
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:43,514
you know,

595
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,080
that's just too obvious I'm going to be.

596
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,350
And yeah,

597
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,620
exactly an indie.

598
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,800
And it was kind of a way of,

599
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,050
of,

600
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,440
you know,

601
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,700
sticking it to the man to say,

602
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:50,971
yeah,

603
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:54,840
like down with your rules were
for drugs and prostitution.

604
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,840
And it was that sort of macho
flash libertarianism and
my story is really of the

605
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,740
deepening of my understanding
of the philosophy of this,

606
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:08,460
because I went to Iraq in
the middle of all this.

607
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:09,990
I was in Fallujah in 2004.

608
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,780
I was a reservist while I was going to
college and I've volunteered for what I

609
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:17,070
called my semester abroad and I did
seven months in Fallujah with the civil

610
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:17,761
affairs team.

611
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:21,570
I was in combat for most
of that time and it was.

612
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:25,890
It was a really intense experience and
coming home and watching the second

613
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:28,350
battle of Fallujah play out on the
front page of the New York Times.

614
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:32,010
While I knew that the only reason we
saw so many marines dying was because of

615
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,640
the political manipulations of what was
happening in the city over the summer

616
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:37,710
that I was there and I was there February,

617
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,120
September 2004.

618
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,480
And coming back and realizing that people
were dying for political bullshit was

619
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,800
a a significant turning point for me and
wanting to really figure out what was

620
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:51,301
behind this.

621
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:51,841
And this is the thing.

622
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,950
I think that sets Libertarians,

623
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,680
a partner that I think a lot of people
in my audience appreciate about your

624
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,770
perspective is that you ask why and
when you don't have good answers,

625
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:02,280
you reject the bullshit and the propaganda
and you see past it and you know,

626
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:06,480
your understanding of foreign policy
from that perspective is very appreciated

627
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:09,870
by a lot of veterans who have gone
through a similar experience that I have.

628
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:13,050
So I got back and I was active
with Iraq veterans against the war,

629
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,170
actually moved to DC to get a
masters in political management.

630
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,360
Oh actually I should say I actually,

631
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:23,220
I got in trouble for bringing a
pistol back from Iraq and it was,

632
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,240
it was a really nice one.

633
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,540
It was like engraved as a gift from
Saddam Hussein and have little gold plated

634
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,340
medallions on the pistol grip.

635
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,130
Yeah.

636
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,410
And I got in trouble for bringing them.

637
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,980
Well,

638
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,910
it's a long story,

639
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:36,330
but I had it on campus and my car got
stolen out of my car and instead of

640
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:36,841
letting it go,

641
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:41,040
I chased the guy down and there was a
campus security guy there and that's how I

642
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,780
got snagged for having an on campus and
it got confiscated and I tried to go.

643
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,820
I tried to go back to Iraq and this
is the thing that really the flip that

644
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,220
switch in your brain when you go through
bootcamp these days and you know,

645
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:57,000
they've heavily developed
the psychological process,

646
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,730
the conditioning that you go through to
make sure that you will obey orders and

647
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,570
you will pull the trigger.

648
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,740
And the reason I wanted to go back to
Iraq was because I didn't get a purple

649
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:05,574
heart the first time.

650
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,271
Like I hadn't.

651
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,410
I hadn't bled enough.

652
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,010
And it really is a sick thing and this
is what makes the military mentality

653
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,281
distinct.

654
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:18,270
There is nothing more glorious
than dying for your country.

655
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,260
And even patents said,

656
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:19,980
you know,

657
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,080
it's making the poor bastard die for his.

658
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,861
But in order to,

659
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:23,230
you know,

660
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,180
as part of the conditioning,

661
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,650
especially in the marines where there's
that certain machismo that first of

662
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:29,120
fight attitude and you know,

663
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,450
there's a noble intent behind it.

664
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,760
I wanted to have my life in
the line from my country,

665
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,220
but really for the people of America,

666
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:35,431
you know,

667
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:37,290
and that was why I enlisted
in the first place.

668
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,180
So they looked at it as what's the
best way to get people to listen to us?

669
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,811
What is the,

670
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:46,380
what's the best way to get people to do
the impossible to do the unthinkable.

671
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,980
He tell that that's what they're supposed

672
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,270
to do.

673
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,830
You have.

674
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,920
We have to figure out what the
best way to program them is.

675
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,390
And they figured it
out and they nailed it.

676
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,100
They got an account that pride that,

677
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:56,340
that fucking that is spreading her.

678
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:56,601
Yeah.

679
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:57,221
That feeling,

680
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:57,700
they put them in the,

681
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,060
just the,

682
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,600
the,

683
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,250
the training sequences and formula.

684
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:00,490
Just,

685
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:00,700
you know,

686
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,011
it's,

687
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:01,870
it's not just that,

688
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,730
because the lesson to be
learned here is that it's,

689
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:04,600
it's everybody.

690
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,580
Everybody who waves the American flag or
the nationalism that's imbued in all of

691
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:09,791
us.

692
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,590
It's the same thing to a lesser degree,

693
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,540
but it's still a perversion of humanity.

694
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,660
It's still a perversion of the way
human beings are designed to get along.

695
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:17,494
Right.

696
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:17,790
Great.

697
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,540
I think the idea of being an
American should be an ideal.

698
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,700
It should be an idea that we
have in our head and should be.

699
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,900
We should look at being American
as something we should aspire to,

700
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,000
but the idea that somehow or another
we're against them or they're against us.

701
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,640
Like what the fuck are you talking
about it and we don't even know them.

702
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,141
Yeah,

703
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:38,621
and it's not.

704
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:42,220
It's not about the arbitrary lines set
up by government around us or it's the

705
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:43,120
American heritage,

706
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:46,630
the American traditional moving towards
greater freedom and the stuff that that

707
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:47,464
represented.

708
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,340
The whole revolutionary war is a step
forward in and the human understanding of

709
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:52,030
liberty,

710
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,640
but you know,

711
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:52,870
it's,

712
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,370
it's an idea that's global.

713
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,900
It's essential to the
human nature does it,

714
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,590
and now we see that America as defined
by any specific thing other than that is,

715
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,713
let's be honest.

716
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,770
Kind of fucking disgusting.

717
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,280
Yeah,

718
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,870
exactly.

719
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,870
Scary and America should
be what we can contribute.

720
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,571
You know what,

721
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:09,751
what,

722
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:12,930
what is our potential or potential
to contribute is so much greater.

723
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,560
You know,

724
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,600
America is not the military
industrial complex.

725
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,910
America is the best fucking
music that's ever been created.

726
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,190
America's the best movies
that's ever been created.

727
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:21,180
The most creativity,

728
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:22,240
the most designed,

729
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,710
most,

730
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,580
all that shit.

731
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,120
I mean,

732
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,350
I love my friends in Europe.

733
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:26,640
I love the Japanese is not.

734
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm not saying that I did any of this.

735
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,660
I'm not taking any credit for this.

736
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,650
I'm a fucking idiot.

737
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,210
I've never invented shit in my life,

738
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,590
but if I look at it objectively,

739
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,880
even if I lived in Spain,

740
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:36,714
I would tell you this,

741
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,231
I'd be like,

742
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:42,231
look at this freak motherfucker country
that in 200 years exploded onto the map,

743
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,760
covered the grove,

744
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,520
the globe with weapons
controlled the whole thing,

745
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,900
locked it all down.

746
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,010
Started boards like,

747
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,180
oh,

748
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,310
what a crazy little country you guys got,

749
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,050
and then got really fat and stupid.

750
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,750
Yeah,

751
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,690
it's fat and lazy and a lot of ways,

752
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,230
a lot,

753
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,760
a lot of dumb shit going on.

754
00:22:59,761 --> 00:22:59,881
Well,

755
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:00,750
let's just corruption.

756
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:05,751
You can't maintain a steady ship
with a constant flow of corruption.

757
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,360
Eventually it just goes off the rails,

758
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:09,240
so eventually you just,

759
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,860
it's not going to balance out,

760
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,640
you're not,

761
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,720
you're not being honest about
how you're running things.

762
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:13,800
So,

763
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,000
so thing is disgusting.

764
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:16,140
Like it's not like,

765
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,520
like there was a threat
that we needed to go after,

766
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,090
don't you?

767
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,400
You guys are creating problems so
you can capitalize on resources.

768
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,640
Like it couldn't be any more obvious
kind of the definition of government

769
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:27,270
though.

770
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,270
But it's the scariest thing ever that
most people would never believe that if

771
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,444
you told them that,

772
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,550
they would say that is hippie bullshit.

773
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,200
That is nonsense.

774
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,990
Who the fuck do you think
you are to think like that?

775
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,410
You know,

776
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,850
what kind of a person are you?

777
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,150
This is America.

778
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,420
Well,

779
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,581
you know,

780
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:44,990
you said it in you.

781
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,460
I listened to your podcast with
Georgiou sucralose and you said,

782
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:49,701
you know,

783
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:50,421
with aliens,

784
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,490
like everybody's looking
for a daddy and it's this.

785
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,640
It's this manifestation of that
psychological desire to be taken care of.

786
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:00,750
And it was worse is with
government for a lot of it.

787
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,850
You said it was aliens and it was God
and religion and I don't know what else.

788
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:06,980
You said a couple of other things,

789
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,110
but you didn't say it was.

790
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:08,350
It was.

791
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,171
It was government.

792
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:09,411
You know,

793
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:09,800
and that's,

794
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,160
that's,

795
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
that's the big one.

796
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:11,630
And that's what's,

797
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,250
that's the global paradigm.

798
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,760
That's like the phase of evolution that
we're at in humanity that we're seeing

799
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,290
the institutionalization,

800
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,590
institutionalization will
collapse of when we see,

801
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:21,880
you know,

802
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,480
this is all centered around the scam of,

803
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,620
of the central banks,

804
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,020
of the Fiat currency because
that's how they really rip us off.

805
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,670
Everything else is about control,

806
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,960
but that's the real incentive.

807
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,160
It's all about exploitation.

808
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,761
That's,

809
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:31,971
I mean,

810
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,151
that's,

811
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:33,230
that's what motivates everything.

812
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,550
As a motivates government.

813
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:37,000
The banking system is
so confusing for people.

814
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,510
When you say the banking system,

815
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,300
it's like you might as well just be
making some noises with your mouth.

816
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,520
Nobody really even understands
what the fuck is going on.

817
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,940
It's propaganda and it's designed to make
you confused and when you look at how

818
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:47,780
much money they have,

819
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:48,141
when you go,

820
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:48,591
wait a minute,

821
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:48,951
wait a minute,

822
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:49,071
wait,

823
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,180
what is that exactly?

824
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,340
Because are you,

825
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,040
what the fuck do you do that?

826
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,640
You get all these ones and Zeros.

827
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:56,720
Where's it all coming from?

828
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
How do you work with.

829
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:00,440
Here's why they don't teach
economics in high school though.

830
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:04,370
I mean because the basic concepts that
anybody can understand what have you very

831
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:08,480
easily come to the conclusion
with a very sound basis of,

832
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,810
of rationale and understanding of economic
framework to get to the point where

833
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,170
you can.

834
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,370
No really,

835
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:14,204
really no,

836
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,800
we're getting fucked.

837
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,910
That like all of the exponential increases
in productivity that should lead to

838
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:22,940
an increase in quality
of life for everybody.

839
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,710
It's still going up and we still see it,

840
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:24,860
you know,

841
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,110
the fact that we have smartphones
and computers and all this shit,

842
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,591
you know,

843
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:27,691
and,

844
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:29,960
and that the average American
is so much better off.

845
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,490
That's still an exponential growth.

846
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,540
But what it would really be if you didn't
have everybody who's on the teat of

847
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,430
government sucking all this
wealth away would have us,

848
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,230
you know,

849
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,480
in,

850
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,730
in flying cars by now.

851
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,010
I mean,

852
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,110
I know that sounds crazy,

853
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:45,890
but you see the wealth that's being
sucked away and what the implication is of

854
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:46,370
that,

855
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,030
we are getting fucked and what's worse
is that we're institutionalizing a system

856
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,540
that is not just a
system that robs from us,

857
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,950
but that kills people.

858
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,640
You know,

859
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,170
that's the police state,

860
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,351
the,

861
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:58,910
the military industrial complex.

862
00:25:58,930 --> 00:25:59,120
You know,

863
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,530
the spasms of,

864
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:01,251
of statism,

865
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:01,860
of our.

866
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,710
But what government fundamentally is,

867
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,090
is the institutionalization of all of
our desires to control and dominate and

868
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:09,500
manipulate others by force.

869
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,120
It's pathological behavior.

870
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,200
It's pathological.

871
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:13,400
It's based on fear.

872
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:17,160
It's based on putting fear into its
citizens and being afraid of the other

873
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,550
people in the world that
other people are not us.

874
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,780
And you know,

875
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:25,781
until we figure out a way
to treat everyone that we
meet in this life as if it

876
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:30,800
was you living another life and told
the world can adopt and develop that

877
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:31,634
attitude.

878
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,750
We're always going to have clients that
are gonna lead us against other cons.

879
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,201
I mean,

880
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,550
that's just the way it is.

881
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,290
We are flawed,

882
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:44,291
fucked up species and somehow or another
we still have the echoes and remanence

883
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,110
of the bygone sword
fights in our fucking DNA,

884
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:49,771
you know,

885
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,580
that shit's still rattles around inside
our head and at the highest levels of

886
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:54,330
government.

887
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,280
They're willing to sacrifice lives
for money at a drop of a hat.

888
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:02,490
They're not worried about it at all
and they're going to go and clean up

889
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:04,620
afterwards and make money on that as well.

890
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,130
Oh yeah.

891
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,650
I mean it's,

892
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,450
it's a staggering business that's
based on 100 percent horseshit.

893
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,770
The idea that no one went to jail after
that whole weapons of mass destruction

894
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:14,880
thing and in Iraq,

895
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:19,200
the fact that none of those cuts went
to jail for lying about weapons of mass

896
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:19,680
destruction.

897
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,280
Being in Iraq,

898
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,330
just that alone,

899
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,260
it just shows you like,

900
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,600
what the fuck did you do?

901
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,530
Like what did you.

902
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,240
How do you not go to jail for that?

903
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,530
If you can't go to jail for that,

904
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,320
how are you trying to pretend
that this is a just system?

905
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,300
You guys made some shit up about weapons
of mass destruction purposely to get

906
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:40,410
people to go to war and then a million
people are dead now and you don't think

907
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:41,310
you fucked up.

908
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,620
You think that was the smart move.

909
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,523
Whoa.

910
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,171
But you know,

911
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:46,440
you know why that's possible?

912
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,570
Because the people that supported it
would rather live with that cognitive

913
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:53,190
dissonance than face up to the truth.

914
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,780
Yeah.

915
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,670
I guess it's also just,

916
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,470
it's harder because we have such a
psychological investment in America,

917
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:01,770
you know,

918
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,341
in our national,

919
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:03,450
we're Americans,

920
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:03,661
you know,

921
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,260
like that is who we are and,

922
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:05,461
and,

923
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:05,941
and it's like,

924
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:06,121
no,

925
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:07,350
you're a human being.

926
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,101
You have to,

927
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:09,120
you have to see past that.

928
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,670
But when you meet Nice people from
other countries and you're like,

929
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,511
poor fuck though,

930
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:13,344
he's Canadian,

931
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,000
be American.

932
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:15,541
You know,

933
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:16,500
people think like that.

934
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,700
You know,

935
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,570
you meet someone in Norway,

936
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,404
man,

937
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,810
poor guy born in Norway and shit.

938
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,880
What a great time.

939
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,721
You know,

940
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:29,721
we have a very distinct and intense form
of nationalism because we're such a war

941
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,193
culture.

942
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,591
I mean,

943
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:32,910
we don't want to think
of ourselves as that.

944
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,100
I would like to think of
ourselves as educated,

945
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:35,881
enlightened people,

946
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,960
but as a collective,

947
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,660
if we really are accepting the
fact that we move as a group,

948
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,201
Dan,

949
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,400
we're doing some shitty things.

950
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:41,971
You know what though?

951
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,310
No one I don't think
anyone is thinking about.

952
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:44,731
Honestly.

953
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:45,660
Even that's the thing.

954
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:48,780
They're not even looking at everybody
who's looking at it like you are,

955
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,591
you know,

956
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:50,490
with an honest.

957
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:54,720
I can see through all
that and it's the result.

958
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:57,690
It's the result of people not even think
is as soon as you think on that level,

959
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,370
you want to change it and really that's,

960
00:28:59,371 --> 00:28:59,791
that's what,

961
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:00,624
that's what this,

962
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,800
this movement that,

963
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,960
that we think of ourselves
right now is a part of the,

964
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:04,720
the level Lucian.

965
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,420
That's really our objective.

966
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,860
Do you think that in the past they were
able to get things off much easier so

967
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:17,040
they have this sort of pattern of behavior
and the way they do business as far

968
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:17,880
as how we go to war,

969
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,050
like the Gulf of Tonkin type shit where
they could get away with stuff like that

970
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,681
in the past.

971
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:23,640
But today with the,

972
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,610
like the sort of the same
group are basically in charge.

973
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,050
I mean they've evolved somewhat,

974
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:30,120
but I mean there's photos of Rumsfeld,

975
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,610
shaking hands with Saddam was saying,

976
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,603
you know what I mean,

977
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,370
a long time ago when it was
the Reagan administration,

978
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,204
is that what it was from?

979
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,560
It was during the Iran,

980
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:38,394
Iraq war.

981
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,480
We're supporting Iran.

982
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,650
Jesus fucking Christ.

983
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:41,010
I mean,

984
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,241
we,

985
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:41,441
we,

986
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:41,861
excuse me.

987
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:42,040
You know

988
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,690
what I gotta I gotTa stop myself there.

989
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:43,841
See,

990
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,980
that's how fucked up this is.

991
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,510
This is how ingrained
it is in the paradigm.

992
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,051
And you know,

993
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:51,010
even when I'm talking about the worst
fucking shit that government does,

994
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,450
the most offensive shit I and I,

995
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:53,980
I,

996
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,340
I,

997
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,581
you know,

998
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:54,681
I,

999
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:57,010
I cuss on my show and I get shit for it,

1000
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:57,940
for my audience sometimes,

1001
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,260
but I sat there all silly.

1002
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,900
I'm going to,

1003
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,733
I'm going to have,

1004
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,140
I'm going to have a curse jars.

1005
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,070
I'm going to put a curse jar.

1006
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:03,904
And every time,

1007
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,230
every time I use status,

1008
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,340
collectivist language,

1009
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,490
every time I say to refer to myself as
part of the evil federal government that

1010
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:12,520
committed these crimes,

1011
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm going to punish myself by
putting a quarter in the real curse.

1012
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:20,250
Sounds like something John Heifer do
the ladder at the top of the ladder.

1013
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:23,800
It really is a bunch of old
white dudes with war money.

1014
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,371
I mean,

1015
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:25,420
that's really what it is.

1016
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,200
Like when you look at the
people that run Halliburton,

1017
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,860
you look at Dick Cheney and look at,

1018
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,680
you know,

1019
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,920
this old white dudes with war money.

1020
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,930
I mean they're in the business of war.

1021
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,660
Really the percentage of the income that,

1022
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:38,650
how Burton per,

1023
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,270
how much they profit off of war.

1024
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,220
That's a staggering number.

1025
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,400
As disgusting as that warm
money is for Halliburton,

1026
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:47,470
what it's really about
as the bankster money,

1027
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,830
it's about the money that goes through
the financial system that flows faster

1028
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,030
for war.

1029
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,730
But,

1030
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,990
but you know what this I have,

1031
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,190
I.

1032
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,431
let me,

1033
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:55,020
let me tell you my,

1034
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,790
my long view perspective here because
I'm much more optimistic and I,

1035
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,683
you know,

1036
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,860
when you understand government
to be pathological behavior,

1037
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,380
it's our inner.

1038
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,350
Whenever you say we need
government for something,

1039
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,720
you're saying we can't
solve this peacefully.

1040
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,350
We need to somehow as the majority impose
our will on the minority or we need to

1041
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:15,020
take money from people by force because
they're not charitable enough or you

1042
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,220
know,

1043
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,350
they don't care about their own
defense and for whatever it is,

1044
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,550
we can't do it peacefully.

1045
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,690
We know we need,

1046
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:20,390
we need force,

1047
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,770
we need,

1048
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,670
we need coercion and it really
comes out of the monkey brain.

1049
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:26,350
It comes out of that.

1050
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,300
When we evolved in the state of nature,

1051
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:31,540
it was in our best interest
that whoever was the biggest,

1052
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,781
you know,

1053
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:35,980
whoever could pick up the biggest rock
was in charge and you go along to get

1054
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:36,311
along.

1055
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,420
Otherwise you don't eat tonight.

1056
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,730
And we're evolving past that.

1057
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,713
And as we just,

1058
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,260
as we develop greater technological
dominance over our environment,

1059
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:46,930
as we are better able
to process information,

1060
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,730
all of these things are leading to the
evolution towards a stateless society.

1061
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,730
We are evolving past this phase of statism
and like you were saying about what

1062
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:59,020
they get away with in war
to answer your question,

1063
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,360
you know,

1064
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,800
it,

1065
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,930
they get away with less.

1066
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:03,090
It's harder to come up with an excuse.

1067
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,090
I mean look at now and it's really sad
to see that we're marching toward Iran.

1068
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,730
But I've made the prediction for awhile
now that we'd see boots on the ground in

1069
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:14,290
Syria first because it's
much better propaganda to
have a humanitarian war where

1070
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:17,530
we can save a bunch of people
from an evil dictator than,

1071
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:17,831
well,

1072
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:21,880
it's the clash of nations and we're
trying to keep Iran from arming themselves

1073
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:22,471
and that,

1074
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:23,740
that propaganda is kind of wearing thin.

1075
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,231
But it's scary.

1076
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:26,020
And I will see they
might get away with that.

1077
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:28,930
They might get a war in Iran and it's all.

1078
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:29,501
Absolutely.

1079
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:30,060
I mean it,

1080
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,280
it.

1081
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,500
But,

1082
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,570
but it's in the 21st century with the
historical perspective that we have.

1083
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:37,000
Is Warren just not fucking
embarrassing at this point.

1084
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:37,960
It should be,

1085
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,311
you know,

1086
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:39,260
it's fascinating me.

1087
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,160
Is this thing that's going

1088
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,000
on in Pakistan,

1089
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,010
if that isn't racist,

1090
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,701
I don't know.

1091
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:48,040
What is this flying of drones that
shoot missiles and blow up citizen.

1092
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:48,681
It's cowardly.

1093
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:49,880
Obama's a fucking murderer.

1094
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,320
It's ridiculous.

1095
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:52,850
The idea that we just accepted.

1096
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,810
I look,

1097
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,320
I believe you that there's some bad
Taliban guys out there that want to commit

1098
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:58,820
terrible things and we
need to get to them,

1099
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,220
but you need to be a little
bit more accurate bitch.

1100
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,150
You imagine if they were using
those things in Germany or you know,

1101
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,570
or Japan or anywhere that
we're allies with and you know,

1102
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,130
and it caused this kind of damage.

1103
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,110
But the fact that it's
happening in Pakistan,

1104
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:12,440
like,

1105
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:12,561
oh,

1106
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:14,360
it's brown people on the planet.

1107
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:14,840
Yeah.

1108
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,450
What do they doing?

1109
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,283
They love their.

1110
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,143
Lost a donkey,

1111
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,100
you know?

1112
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,933
Yeah,

1113
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,401
yeah.

1114
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:19,641
I mean,

1115
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:20,520
these poor folks,

1116
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,250
they're looking at them like they're,

1117
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,720
you know,

1118
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,990
they're living a shit life anyway.

1119
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:24,981
Well,

1120
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:25,191
you know,

1121
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:27,960
it's one of the things that
they have done recently in,

1122
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,510
uh,

1123
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,331
with the Taliban.

1124
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:32,540
They've said that they're going to stop
administering polio vaccines if they

1125
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:37,010
don't stop the drone strikes because
the ptsd that they are causing in the

1126
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:40,010
population is worse than
having fucking polio.

1127
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:40,370
I mean,

1128
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,030
how citizens.

1129
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,170
But I got a quote here.

1130
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:43,100
This is Anwar Allah,

1131
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:48,101
lucky the New Mexico born a man that was
killed in Yemen by a drone strike by,

1132
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,031
by order,

1133
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:50,571
by Obama.

1134
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,550
His 16 year old son was also murdered.

1135
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,000
Uh,

1136
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,520
the same way a week later you probably
heard that story of Abdul Ramond all

1137
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,400
lucky and he was,

1138
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,820
he was made out to be the great
propagandist for al Qaeda.

1139
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,380
This is,

1140
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
this is the quote from him.

1141
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,710
Our position needs to be reiterated
and needs to be very clear.

1142
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:11,090
The fact that the US has administered
that death and homicide of over 1 million

1143
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,080
civilians in Iraq.

1144
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:16,430
The fact that the United
States is supporting the
deaths of killing of thousands

1145
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:20,210
of Palestinians does not
justify the killing of one
US civilian in New York City

1146
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:21,190
or Washington DC.

1147
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,790
And the deaths of 6,000 civilians in New
York and Washington DC does not justify

1148
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,590
the death of one civilian and Afghanistan.

1149
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,240
That doesn't sound like a terrorist.

1150
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,190
It sounds like the guys making sense.

1151
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,203
No Shit.

1152
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,330
That's why I'm kind of afraid to
be in this line of work myself.

1153
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:38,870
Yeah.

1154
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,970
It's creepy line of work
when they can just label you,

1155
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,620
you know?

1156
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:41,930
I mean,

1157
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,830
no one wants to look at it from this
side that perhaps the United States has

1158
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,820
done some heinous things.

1159
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,830
There's a reason why these people want
to do something to us and we go us to,

1160
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,180
to the citizens of this great nation.

1161
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,471
You know what?

1162
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:54,711
In a way,

1163
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:59,711
they're smarter than us because our
reaction culturally is dehumanization.

1164
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,490
It's,

1165
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,690
it's an implicit racism for us.

1166
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,600
They're smarter than they want it.

1167
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,560
When they actually come
at it strategically,

1168
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,750
like they want to change our behavior,

1169
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:10,610
they want us to stop bombing them.

1170
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:10,910
You know?

1171
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,790
And maybe they're not good.

1172
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm not endorsing terrorism obviously.

1173
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,620
But if anything,

1174
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:19,670
their anger is much more aware
and directed at the US government.

1175
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,391
Well,

1176
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:22,580
my whole positions that were not innocent,

1177
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,010
you know,

1178
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,231
the,

1179
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:24,350
the United States government,

1180
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,530
we,

1181
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,160
it,

1182
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,410
whatever's over there,

1183
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,460
we're not as innocent.

1184
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,323
It's that simple.

1185
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
So if we're not innocent,

1186
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,640
we have to take some sort
of responsibility where they
have to take some sort of

1187
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:36,170
responsibility for the repercussions.

1188
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,010
If you're doing that's fucked up and

1189
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,880
people are dying,

1190
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,320
you got to know that you've,

1191
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,930
you've done something terrible
and you need to make amends,

1192
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,261
you know,

1193
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,790
you need to fix this whole thing.

1194
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:47,160
Like you can't just to
get out of there now.

1195
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,420
He can't just get out of there and leave
it behind some fucking crazy civil war.

1196
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,000
Well that's the denial that
America is in and if I may,

1197
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:59,700
the next part of my story was coming
back from Iraq and in trouble with this,

1198
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,650
trying to go back to get a purple heart.

1199
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:06,060
And when I got out of the Marines I had
been as a sergeant who spoke Arabic,

1200
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:07,230
was civil affairs experience.

1201
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:11,190
Pissed off because I was managing a
barracks and mowing lawns for most of the

1202
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,670
year.

1203
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,040
And I got out and I was disgruntled.

1204
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:18,450
It was like the day after I got a medal
for heroism under fire and all the other

1205
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:20,940
crap that I got cited for
when I was in Fallujah.

1206
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,560
That took three years to process.

1207
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,300
They busted me down from sergeant
corporal and I got out and I was in my,

1208
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,560
you know,

1209
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,370
the exploration of my.

1210
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,360
Do they do that from
bringing the pistol back?

1211
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:30,930
Oh,

1212
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,810
because if it got through the system
and got back to NCI and Yada Yada,

1213
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:34,021
Yada.

1214
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:35,340
So I got in trouble for that.

1215
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,750
So you never got that pistol back?

1216
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,613
No,

1217
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,240
I know.

1218
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,520
I know.

1219
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,850
And,

1220
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,450
but I did get to fire
it a couple of times.

1221
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,880
Pistol.

1222
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,900
Well an official gift from the
regime or something like that.

1223
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,820
But it was the coolest orical piece I got.

1224
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:48,810
I got plenty of guns now.

1225
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,260
But this is an important thing about
who is going to be on the front lines of

1226
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,610
this revolution right now.

1227
00:36:56,611 --> 00:37:00,870
They were facing who was going to help
us evolve past this status paradigm.

1228
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:04,950
Who's going to help us push past and see
past the collapse of government because

1229
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,700
it's not going to be the people that the
system treats well and this whole thing

1230
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:09,150
is set up.

1231
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,490
You have the propagandizing class,

1232
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:11,701
you know,

1233
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:11,891
you,

1234
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:12,121
you,

1235
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:13,980
you have the dependent class,

1236
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:18,981
you have the enforcement class and the
law enforcement in the military and you

1237
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,290
have people that are bought
into the system as a whole,

1238
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:22,531
you know,

1239
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,730
whole variety of levels in a way.

1240
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:26,190
That's how they get away with is
they make everybody think they're,

1241
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,180
they're benefiting from it.

1242
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,650
And they have people you know.

1243
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:30,680
And it's like if capitalism,

1244
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,770
a true free market,

1245
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:35,680
unnatural society where
people have property rights
is like a rough fabric when

1246
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:35,771
you,

1247
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:38,250
when you introduced the Federal Reserve
and you have this thing that can create

1248
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:39,120
money out of thin air,

1249
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,350
it's like pulling it up and create an
unnatural spike and concentration of

1250
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:44,041
wealth and power.

1251
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,840
And we have this illusion of capitalism.

1252
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:47,370
Like we can own property and we can trade,

1253
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,040
but it's this whole
spike where everybody is,

1254
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,551
you know,

1255
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:51,990
kind of picked up along with it.

1256
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,990
And this illusion of being able to print
money that's worth something and that's

1257
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,670
how they manipulate the economy and
that's what people really get screwed.

1258
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:03,560
But the first people that are going to
be questioning the system aren't going to

1259
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:07,440
be the guy that was student body president
or captain of the football squad or

1260
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:08,610
the cheerleading team,

1261
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:08,881
you know,

1262
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:12,420
it's going to be the miscreants and
the punks and the and the misfits.

1263
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,130
And the people that were,

1264
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:14,941
you know,

1265
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:19,120
in a sense challenging authority naturally
because they had something in it or

1266
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,310
they had something in their life.

1267
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:23,790
And the thing is right now it's
about being a victim of government.

1268
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,690
You know,

1269
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,820
how many people do you know
that that got arrested?

1270
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:27,710
And when they got arrested they,

1271
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:27,851
they,

1272
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,010
they turned political.

1273
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,840
You know,

1274
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,630
they started paying attention because
it hits home and they stopped trusting

1275
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:33,990
government.

1276
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,290
And that's a really important thing.

1277
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,780
And the rest of us have to
stop turning a blind eye.

1278
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,141
And I say,

1279
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:38,711
the rest of us,

1280
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:39,460
again,

1281
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,110
maybe a bad collectivizing term,

1282
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,770
but the people that are asleep to this
need to stop turning a blind eye and

1283
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:44,981
saying,

1284
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:45,251
well,

1285
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,090
I got mine.

1286
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,223
I'm cool.

1287
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,260
I got my paycheck because
somebody else was getting fucked.

1288
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,610
And the thing is that it's so exciting
is that enough people have been fucked.

1289
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:58,870
Now that it's coming to a critical
mass where people are questioning the

1290
00:38:58,871 --> 00:38:59,201
government,

1291
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,011
people are waking up,

1292
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:02,290
people are saying we don't
need this thing anymore.

1293
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,760
We are standing up to the bully.

1294
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,950
And that's what's so fun about,

1295
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:05,100
you know,

1296
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,610
what I do now in civil disobedience.

1297
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,810
Speaking of which did,

1298
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,460
did you get my invitation
to the party yesterday?

1299
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,623
Okay,

1300
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,550
well we had a really exciting event
and this is a civil disobedience beach

1301
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:19,270
party.

1302
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,800
We went to like a beach party.

1303
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,590
We went to the.

1304
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:21,920
Yeah,

1305
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,691
I know in a sense,

1306
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:24,130
but oh man,

1307
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,011
we know it's,

1308
00:39:25,011 --> 00:39:25,201
it's,

1309
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:28,270
it's where you deliberately go and
break as many laws nonviolently as you

1310
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:28,991
possibly can.

1311
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,910
And so we dug holes deep,

1312
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,060
deeper than 18 inches and we smoked pot
without a license and we threw footballs

1313
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:38,590
and frisbees and it not allowed to throw
footballs and Frisbees at the Santa

1314
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:38,650
Monica Pier.

1315
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,480
What?

1316
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,313
Yeah.

1317
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:40,961
Oh,

1318
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,380
come on.

1319
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,213
Really?

1320
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,750
No frisbees.

1321
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:43,931
Yeah.

1322
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:44,161
But see,

1323
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:44,500
you know,

1324
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:44,820
what's your,

1325
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,180
what's your normal reaction to that?

1326
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:46,390
Ah,

1327
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,900
fuck it.

1328
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,740
What's another law?

1329
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:49,240
And you walk away and he's so stupid.

1330
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:49,510
So you know,

1331
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,961
people are.

1332
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:51,220
And this is really petty.

1333
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,970
Well the real problem is country kids
that throw those fucking frisbees too hard

1334
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:55,870
and they hit babies.

1335
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,380
So the answer is to have police go and
try to chase them down and issue them

1336
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:00,700
thousand dollars ticket.

1337
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,670
So the answer is you got to go back in
time to when their parents aren't seeing

1338
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,580
them and then work with the parents.

1339
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,790
Try to straighten out with their emotional
bullshit to make them a shitty parent

1340
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,900
so that they can deliver a kid
that's better functioning in society.

1341
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,141
Okay?

1342
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:14,770
So let me know.

1343
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,780
That kid is all fucked up.

1344
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,890
You got to deal with them.

1345
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:19,300
Somebody made a fucked up kid,

1346
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,290
lit that fucked up kid.

1347
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:23,710
Get loose and he's whipping a frisbee
around near your two year old baby.

1348
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,101
Okay,

1349
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:26,140
but this is why things are getting better.

1350
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,730
This is,

1351
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,910
this is the site because people want
to be better parents and pathological

1352
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:31,331
behavior.

1353
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:33,310
Why do people grow up
to be violent criminals?

1354
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,830
It's usually because they were
abused as children in some way.

1355
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:36,191
You're right.

1356
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:36,450
Yeah.

1357
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:36,630
It's,

1358
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,890
it's emotional abuse or physical abuse,

1359
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:40,750
but people aren't naturally violent.

1360
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,710
People are.

1361
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,620
The natural state is to want to
cooperate with fellow human beings.

1362
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,680
At least that's what we're evolving
towards and so think about it.

1363
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,610
Like right now,

1364
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,060
compared to the state of
nature 200,000 years ago,

1365
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,110
you know,

1366
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,490
everybody had to work 16 hours a day
hunting and gathering to survive,

1367
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:58,030
right?

1368
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,990
And now the average American can
work from when they're 22 to 65,

1369
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:05,710
eight hours a day with
weekends and vacation time
and support a whole family for

1370
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:06,700
their lifetime on that.

1371
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,200
And if anything,

1372
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,290
it would be a lot less than that with,

1373
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,450
with without the central banking system
that we have today without the systems

1374
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:14,470
of government exploitation,

1375
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,940
robbing that exponential growth,

1376
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,460
what should be exponential growth
and quality of life and it's,

1377
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:20,350
it's still exponential,

1378
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:24,430
but not nearly as much as it should be
and what we're coming to like how are you

1379
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:28,720
going to convince people that you need a
welfare state when you can work for one

1380
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:32,290
year and save enough money to live at
the quality of life that we enjoy today

1381
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,320
for the rest of your life.

1382
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,150
That's

1383
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,350
and,

1384
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:34,590
and,

1385
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,423
and to me,

1386
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,580
that's what makes this such
an exciting time to be alive.

1387
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,670
And you just look at,

1388
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,140
look at how much less violence there is
and this is a really beautiful thing.

1389
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:44,840
You can look at government and
be pissed off all you want.

1390
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,560
And this is where I've come to now,

1391
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:50,000
hour as a zen libertarian is
being able to see this big,

1392
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,420
bigger picture and that the actual average
amount of violence that an individual

1393
00:41:54,421 --> 00:41:58,940
is subject to is at an all time historic
low for as long as we've been able to

1394
00:41:58,941 --> 00:41:59,331
track it.

1395
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:00,380
That's part of that evolution.

1396
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:05,120
This is the natural development of
life from single celled organisms,

1397
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:05,591
from you know,

1398
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:08,810
little molecules bouncing around
in the primordial soup together.

1399
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:12,830
The essence of life is cooperation
is pooling of resources you know,

1400
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,130
of coming together of
energy coming into harmony.

1401
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,840
And that's what we're going through.

1402
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,390
And we're seeing this
process of two steps forward.

1403
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:21,171
One step backwards,

1404
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,300
and we're in the middle of a
big step backwards right now.

1405
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,050
That really is centered around
the institutionalization
of the Federal Reserve

1406
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:29,660
and the modern systems of government
going back about 100 years.

1407
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,980
And within that time,

1408
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:31,131
you know,

1409
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,210
we've had steps forwards,

1410
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,321
gay rights movement,

1411
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:34,310
the women's rights movement,

1412
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:35,330
the civil rights movement.

1413
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,400
Not In how they were
institutionalized in government,

1414
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:38,000
but how they,

1415
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,800
what they represented for society.

1416
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:40,790
We're steps forward,

1417
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,310
but we're coming to this major step
forward now when we get past this entire

1418
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,970
paradigm of statism and it's a beautiful
thing to see that as we're able to

1419
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:55,130
raise our children nonviolently as we're
able to be better parents because we

1420
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,460
have better prosperity and
better just the leisure time,

1421
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:01,250
the ability to do things that
the cave men couldn't do,

1422
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,810
and raise children that are emotionally
well balanced and don't engage in this

1423
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,550
pathological behavior that has government.

1424
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:08,390
I,

1425
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,780
uh,

1426
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,220
I agree that it seems that if you,

1427
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:11,810
you know,

1428
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,330
you,

1429
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:17,300
you measure our time on earth in
comparison to the Greeks or the Romans or

1430
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,640
anybody lived in any sort of
an ancient civilization like,

1431
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:19,820
yeah,

1432
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,000
no one's ever had it as good as we
have as far as the less violence,

1433
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:23,834
the more health,

1434
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,280
the more pleasure.

1435
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,110
It's like the people
being nice to each other.

1436
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:29,900
People understanding the impact
of being nice to each other.

1437
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:32,750
Actually understanding
what that's all about now.

1438
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,340
That's never happened before.

1439
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,900
But the way it's happening now,

1440
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,510
Americans are factors were
like citizens of the empire,

1441
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,110
but the.

1442
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:39,470
Yeah,

1443
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,410
but if you look at the
rest of the world though,

1444
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,440
if you look at especially the impact on
some of the things that are necessary in

1445
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:53,501
order to produce the amount of power
that's necessary to run this crazy sort of

1446
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,550
a peaceful,

1447
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:59,210
easy go and country that we think
of as America or you drive around,

1448
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:00,950
there's really not that
much crime drive around.

1449
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:01,970
It's really not that much violence.

1450
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:02,930
Well,

1451
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:03,290
how,

1452
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,730
how were you driving on gas?

1453
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:05,690
Where's that gas coming from?

1454
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:06,020
Dude,

1455
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,020
the gas is coming from a place that's
getting bombed from the sky with missiles

1456
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:13,580
and that's where we have
apartment buildings or blowing up.

1457
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:13,911
I mean,

1458
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:14,021
you know.

1459
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:14,330
Yeah.

1460
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,920
People are dying left and right,

1461
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:16,941
so it's.

1462
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:17,200
So.

1463
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,660
It's.

1464
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,980
Is it possible to have all that
shit without all the bad shit?

1465
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,750
Is it even possible to have in this day
and age or is this like an over clock

1466
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,584
society,

1467
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,920
is the only way to have a society
like America possible is they're at

1468
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,720
the very top of the food chain doing all
sorts of fucked up on ethical shit or

1469
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:41,721
is it possible to have the control over
the resources that we have and still be

1470
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:46,941
ethical as it possible to run a society
like this and not do anything fucked up?

1471
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:54,270
I think even the way that you're asking
that question is reinforcing the idea of

1472
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:55,400
a country and I am right.

1473
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,720
Anything that's going to
eventually completely go away.

1474
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,020
Well,

1475
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,320
no.

1476
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,860
Yes,

1477
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,121
but it,

1478
00:44:59,121 --> 00:44:59,280
it,

1479
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,670
it represents the framework
from which you're coming from.

1480
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:06,770
This represents the status paradigm of,

1481
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:07,520
uh,

1482
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,280
you know,

1483
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,900
how do we have an identity or how do
we have a society when you're using

1484
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:13,830
government in,

1485
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:16,410
in a way that doesn't clearly define it,

1486
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,270
and when you really break it down,

1487
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,350
the only clear way to define government
is a group of people within arbitrary,

1488
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,880
geographically based monopoly
on the initiation of force.

1489
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,410
That's,

1490
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,260
that's what sets them apart.

1491
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:30,000
Like if I go in and say,

1492
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:30,361
you know,

1493
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,230
put a gun to your head and say,

1494
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:31,831
give me your wallet,

1495
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:32,191
I can't,

1496
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:32,401
you know,

1497
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:33,234
that that's wrong,

1498
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,190
or you can't be a gang member.

1499
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,320
But if you're in a war
with another gang and say,

1500
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:37,740
look,

1501
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,970
these guys aren't murderers.

1502
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:39,241
I,

1503
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:39,571
they're,

1504
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,530
they're in my army.

1505
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,050
I made them go to war with the bad gang.

1506
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,620
Exactly what the fuck you talking about?

1507
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,190
That's it.

1508
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,500
I mean generally police,

1509
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,861
you know,

1510
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:47,240
and it's,

1511
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,700
it's what's sick is that
we have to extricate,

1512
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,160
we have to,

1513
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,710
we have to pull out these
legitimate functions of
government in order to get rid

1514
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:55,891
of it.

1515
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,990
Like it's really tricky
with the police state.

1516
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:59,280
It's an issue I'm really passionate about.

1517
00:45:59,281 --> 00:45:59,430
You know,

1518
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,150
one of the things that I'm kind of put
me on the map was the Jefferson dance

1519
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:06,750
party wouldn't when I got picked up
and body slammed by a police officer,

1520
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,700
the Jefferson Memorial
for dancing in public.

1521
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,260
And that was,

1522
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:10,720
that was,

1523
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:10,980
uh,

1524
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,761
that's my video.

1525
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:13,590
That's got over a million views.

1526
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,230
Police pull that shit up.

1527
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:16,680
Brian.

1528
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,490
Where's Brian?

1529
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,420
But he's Outta here.

1530
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,340
You can't get it from the sound anyways,

1531
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:21,870
but vanished.

1532
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,531
You know,

1533
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,080
police officers do serve
a legitimate function.

1534
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:27,540
The problem is that they've got
a government monopoly on it,

1535
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,351
you know,

1536
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,760
that they provide for the public safety.

1537
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:34,500
But private security is obviously much
better and when you have this monopoly

1538
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:34,891
power,

1539
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:36,150
they're not accountable to the people.

1540
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:37,980
There's always that detachment and it's,

1541
00:46:37,981 --> 00:46:38,560
it's the,

1542
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,750
the idea of government.

1543
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:40,290
You say,

1544
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,760
do we need government for society?

1545
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,250
It's a government is
antithetical to society.

1546
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:48,060
If Society is defined as how people come
up with an identity and come together

1547
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:51,570
peacefully and cooperatively and engage
in commerce and do productive things.

1548
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,583
And it's like,

1549
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,590
you know how,

1550
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,830
how do you say,

1551
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,300
how do you live healthy with
a giant Leech on your back?

1552
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,531
You know,

1553
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:58,410
is that essential?

1554
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:58,861
And it's like,

1555
00:46:58,861 --> 00:46:58,971
no,

1556
00:46:58,971 --> 00:46:59,031
no,

1557
00:46:59,031 --> 00:46:59,130
no,

1558
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,200
you're in this government
has to be a leach.

1559
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:02,100
That's the question.

1560
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:03,720
Is government have to be that?

1561
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,930
Is it possible to have a
government where it's just,

1562
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:07,470
you know,

1563
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,470
we have a set of values that we put in
place in order to help society run better

1564
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:18,120
and that's we all take place in it and
we call that government could be not

1565
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:18,511
elite,

1566
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:22,320
but it can never by definition be moral
and will always then give someone an

1567
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:23,940
unjust power that is corrupting.

1568
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,110
I got to see this video,

1569
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:25,944
man.

1570
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,510
Brian,

1571
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,343
where's Brian?

1572
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,800
You'll want me to vamp

1573
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,783
Brian.

1574
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:38,443
All right.

1575
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,960
This is Adam [inaudible] taking over
the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

1576
00:47:41,961 --> 00:47:42,920
Thank you very much.

1577
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,493
Hm.

1578
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,373
Dustin,

1579
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,010
Dustin,

1580
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:49,850
Dustin is here.

1581
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,250
Mild coproducer from the radio show.

1582
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:56,900
They want to send them a text
message to them to get back in there.

1583
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,360
So explain to me what happened to you.

1584
00:47:59,361 --> 00:48:00,960
They picked you up and body slammed you.

1585
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:01,371
Well,

1586
00:48:01,371 --> 00:48:01,580
it's,

1587
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:01,680
Oh,

1588
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,930
did you want to see a video?

1589
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:03,764
Man?

1590
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:05,930
I don't want to see in it

1591
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,260
now.

1592
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,390
So it's a bit of a story as it goes back,

1593
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,890
like three or four years ago,

1594
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,560
there was a group of 18 people that were
just a bunch of Libertarian activist

1595
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:17,000
that like Thomas Jefferson.

1596
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,330
And so they wanted to go dance
because he was the dancing president.

1597
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,300
I didn't find out about this
until after the incident.

1598
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:27,170
My facebook wall got just covered with
all these Jefferson quotes about how he

1599
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:30,170
liked to dance and bust out the fiddle
at the White House and stuff like that.

1600
00:48:30,171 --> 00:48:34,340
But they went and danced at midnight on
Thomas Jefferson's birthday just as a

1601
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:35,600
little flash mob thing.

1602
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,290
Right.

1603
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:41,210
And the security guards came and start
trying try to shoo them out of the

1604
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:42,044
memorial.

1605
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,930
And one of them was dancing
out and got arrested.

1606
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:45,861
And they were like,

1607
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:47,210
what the fuck?

1608
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,670
And so they tried to to fight it in court.

1609
00:48:49,671 --> 00:48:52,520
And like three years later the judge said,

1610
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:52,761
you know,

1611
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:53,220
like as if the,

1612
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,800
if the judge had said on the grounds
of it's improper usage or it's a safety

1613
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,120
threat or it's like,

1614
00:48:59,121 --> 00:48:59,390
you know,

1615
00:48:59,390 --> 00:48:59,710
the,

1616
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,510
there was a way that they could have
legitimately said there's no dancing.

1617
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,840
But it's kind of a ridiculous thing to
say anywhere that you're legally allowed

1618
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:06,674
to be.

1619
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,260
You don't have control over your body.

1620
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:10,410
Or if you move in a certain way,

1621
00:49:10,411 --> 00:49:11,840
like that's going to be illegal,

1622
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,590
you know,

1623
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,460
so it's,

1624
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,200
it's kind of absurd on its premise,

1625
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:16,400
like most of the things of,

1626
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:16,660
of,

1627
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,930
of government when you really go down
to the actual core premise of what it

1628
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:21,764
means to be,

1629
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,080
what,

1630
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:22,221
when,

1631
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:22,490
when,

1632
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,550
when you say there should be a law for
this or it should be illegal for that,

1633
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,020
but we,

1634
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:27,290
uh,

1635
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:32,290
we decided to go back because the judge
said it was not appropriately reverent

1636
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,403
enough.

1637
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,250
Reverent,

1638
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,083
yes.

1639
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,490
You had to be reverent
of Thomas Jefferson.

1640
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:42,170
This is a public memorial where you've
got kids spilling drinks and playing with

1641
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,130
toys and cars and shit like all
over the place and you can't dance.

1642
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,053
What's the video?

1643
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,900
If you go to youtube.com/Adam kochish
and then search for most viewed

1644
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:59,570
a high vitamin K o k
e s h o k what was it?

1645
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,790
K O k e s h,

1646
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,310
yes.

1647
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,440
It's kind of a long video.

1648
00:50:03,441 --> 00:50:04,041
It's 10 minutes.

1649
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,730
But so we went back and we know,

1650
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,640
we decided we're going to start dancing
and the cops were waiting for us.

1651
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,100
So they said who's in charge here?

1652
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:14,840
And we all pointed to Thomas Jefferson,

1653
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:15,920
you know,

1654
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,920
the giant 30 foot statue of him and
this couple that was there just started

1655
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:27,131
dancing and they bumped into one of the
cops and the cop was like pointing his

1656
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:27,730
goons.

1657
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,670
You go go,

1658
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,533
go arrest them.

1659
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,100
And they're swaying like hugging
like Dan the barely dancing.

1660
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,840
And so the rest of us were like,

1661
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:36,411
well fuck that.

1662
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:37,244
It's on.

1663
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:42,310
And I was listening to what you can do
it by ice cube and you could barely call

1664
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:44,150
what I was doing dancing.

1665
00:50:44,151 --> 00:50:45,650
But by the end of this they,

1666
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:46,461
they picked me,

1667
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:50,390
the cop like picked me up and body
slammed me because I was resisting with my

1668
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:52,310
hands out like this at my
hands out in front of me.

1669
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:52,431
Like,

1670
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:52,581
you know,

1671
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:52,881
I'm not,

1672
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:53,714
I'm not violent.

1673
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,770
And he picked me up and body slammed me
and then kneed me in the ribs and choked

1674
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:59,030
me on the ground there.

1675
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,070
And the crazy part is,

1676
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,610
you know,

1677
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:02,480
I was in the marines,

1678
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:02,751
I was,

1679
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:04,310
I was in the Marine Corps rugby team.

1680
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,740
We trained for MMA right now.

1681
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:07,940
But if I'm,

1682
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,650
I didn't know how to fall,

1683
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:10,430
like I,

1684
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,020
W I would have fractured my skull,

1685
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,370
like if I had gone limp and flipped
bags on a marble floor and I would have

1686
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:17,360
cracked my skull open,

1687
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,920
but you could have done,

1688
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,601
um,

1689
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:19,800
I,

1690
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,060
you know,

1691
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,330
ask around and I was okay.

1692
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,230
We did.

1693
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,770
It's the top in the middle there.

1694
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,290
You can watch the whole thing unfold.

1695
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,380
Somebody that's leading

1696
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,540
this guy body slammed you.

1697
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,000
This is the.

1698
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,833
Yeah,

1699
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,480
I mean it's this,

1700
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,110
it's this little chubby guy with,

1701
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,300
with probably a really small penis,

1702
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,770
but that's,

1703
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,120
that's the people that are authorized
to use violence by government.

1704
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,600
That's got a sweet bike helmet.

1705
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,880
So he comes up and he's threatening to
arrest us without telling us that there's

1706
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,740
any law that we would be violating the

1707
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,900
city to allow citation

1708
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,220
and he just avoids the question.

1709
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,880
You'll find out what,

1710
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:22,110
what am I being arrested for?

1711
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,750
You'll find out he's incompetent.

1712
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,733
Then

1713
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,550
we tried to get a legal
definition of dancing.

1714
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,550
Wow.

1715
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,680
What if you're at a time when you making
movements with your body still dancing?

1716
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:44,323
Yeah.

1717
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:47,510
So now he calls over his gun and he's

1718
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,380
look at the little finger poke,

1719
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,240
come on,

1720
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,330
stop dancing.

1721
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,480
Oh my God,

1722
00:52:58,481 --> 00:52:59,380
this is crazy.

1723
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,720
This is nothing man.

1724
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:02,110
This is,

1725
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,520
this is just the beginning of this.

1726
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,073
Give me a warning.

1727
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,640
And these cops are
arresting her for dancing,

1728
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,020
for standing in slang.

1729
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:11,141
You know,

1730
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:12,400
it's funny because this
happened in New York,

1731
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,470
so there's me sort of dancing.

1732
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,760
This is crazy.

1733
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,670
So this is what we do now.

1734
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,090
Regular civil disobedience
where we just risked,

1735
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:32,940
arrest and stand up to the
bully that has government.

1736
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:33,151
You know,

1737
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:35,790
we had the curse in Middleborough
Massachusetts last week.

1738
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,571
Wow.

1739
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:37,570
This is crazy.

1740
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,120
They made it illegal to curse.

1741
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:39,961
Did you hear that story?

1742
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:40,591
I was in Middleborough,

1743
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:42,690
Massachusetts back and had a protest.

1744
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:43,020
Instead.

1745
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,420
We're just free fucking
speech demonstration

1746
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,890
so it wouldn't be complete with
little stare down with the cops there.

1747
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:53,260
And I really didn't think I was going to
go out and get arrested late actually.

1748
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:55,090
I thought saying what
does this dude saying?

1749
00:53:55,091 --> 00:53:55,901
You hate America.

1750
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:56,681
You hate freedom.

1751
00:53:56,681 --> 00:53:57,640
We've seen that to the cop.

1752
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:58,563
Yup.

1753
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,110
So this is where it starts to get ugly.

1754
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,960
So he's like reaching out and

1755
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:19,570
punching him in the chest.

1756
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,940
This is America,

1757
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,200
the public.

1758
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,000
So this is the crazy part here.

1759
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,180
See there,

1760
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,290
he needs me in the ribs and you
see it go in like resisting arrest.

1761
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,520
Still resisting arrest.

1762
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:55,300
I mean even though it is as stupid
as it is of what the charge is,

1763
00:54:55,301 --> 00:54:57,730
and then I mean when a police officers.

1764
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,400
But that's the point is to
show the violence of it.

1765
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,051
There's no,

1766
00:55:02,051 --> 00:55:03,580
there's no justification for that.

1767
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,660
The whole thing is ridiculous.

1768
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:05,290
Let's cops.

1769
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:08,280
They wanted to maintain this bullshit.

1770
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:09,460
Yeah.

1771
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:09,940
Bullshit.

1772
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,610
Sense of control and authority and they
didn't recognize something that was

1773
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:13,610
absolutely not a threat.

1774
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:14,920
Just a bunch of peaceful people.

1775
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:15,231
Oh,

1776
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:18,640
they're hugging and you got to arrest
him for hugging and moving their bodies.

1777
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,061
That's.

1778
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:19,630
There's no,

1779
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,340
there's no justification for this.

1780
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,510
This is nonsense.

1781
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,590
You guys weren't causing
problems or hassling people mean.

1782
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:28,390
If you look into the
context of this video,

1783
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,224
this is insane.

1784
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,850
I don't know how these guys cannot.

1785
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,913
You cannot.

1786
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,470
You cannot stop them from dancing.

1787
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,450
You cannot stop them from kissing.

1788
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,230
You cannot stop doing.

1789
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,590
Then they kicked the media out,

1790
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:51,180
like how perfect is this as as
a microcosm of what government.

1791
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,550
Who's got this camera?

1792
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,540
Who's filming this?

1793
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,010
This is actually dustin.

1794
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:56,720
Actually the guy in the room right now.

1795
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,120
This was when I had my tv show in DC.

1796
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,980
What is he filming this with?

1797
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,291
Dustin,

1798
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:04,130
you want to step in here?

1799
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:04,964
What are we filming?

1800
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:09,993
I can't hear you.

1801
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,141
Just a little camera.

1802
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:14,150
I think he said it's a
small handheld camera.

1803
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,100
Was a canon from back.

1804
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,690
Nobody told you to stop filming.

1805
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,050
It was funny because they kick out
the mainstream guy before they see me.

1806
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:22,670
I was kind of just dancing along,

1807
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,110
come and moving the laser,

1808
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,220
so there's a couple other guys that were
filming this as well to get kicked out.

1809
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,820
What's really ironic is they kicked out.

1810
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,100
Well it doesn't say they
kicked out the guy from Fox.

1811
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,240
There's a local Fox network,

1812
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,610
I think that was covering it
that day and they kicked him out.

1813
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:38,590
They kick out the guy with the
big camera and then Dustin,

1814
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,433
because you know he's.

1815
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:40,350
Wow.

1816
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,830
We were shoestring television.

1817
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,131
What?

1818
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,740
That right there was
just idiots with power.

1819
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,221
That's all.

1820
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:46,054
That was.

1821
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,680
Incompetent fools.

1822
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,660
That's a foolish person.

1823
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,350
It isn't that a fun way to wake people
up to to show people that he's a pussy.

1824
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,090
This is what I always say about any,

1825
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:55,781
any laws,

1826
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:56,860
any people getting arrested.

1827
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:58,900
I use what I call the
clinics would method.

1828
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:02,770
Could you imagine clinics
would in a movie holding a gun,

1829
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,120
arresting someone for that?

1830
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,230
If not,

1831
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,220
then it's a stupid law because if you're
not stealing or hurting someone or

1832
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,840
robbing someone within.

1833
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,690
What's the smart law?

1834
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:12,100
Joe?

1835
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,520
A smart law is something
that's set in place.

1836
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,170
People don't fuck five-year-olds.

1837
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,020
Maybe that should be a law.

1838
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:25,360
Maybe the earlier that we should have
or are the ones that are based on on

1839
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:27,880
respecting each other instead
of having a central authority,

1840
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:31,030
deciding what what even the
standards of society are going to be.

1841
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,300
Do you think that with the Internet
and what's happening now with the

1842
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:39,301
integration of society and technology
that we're sort of slowly but surely

1843
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,130
getting closer to each other,

1844
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:44,950
even that it's comfortable and it's
going to get to a certain point in time

1845
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:47,170
where there's not going to be a
whole lot of privacy in this world?

1846
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:47,591
Yeah.

1847
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:47,790
No,

1848
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,960
but I think maybe that'll be.

1849
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:50,711
I mean,

1850
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:53,380
it's scary for us
because we value privacy,

1851
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,600
but it might ultimately be for the best.

1852
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,710
I think it's always for the best.

1853
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,660
I have faith in technology
because it's empowering,

1854
00:57:58,661 --> 00:58:01,630
but it's kind of scary right now to
see that it's empowering to itself.

1855
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,850
What I'm saying doesn't have a moral idea.

1856
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:08,430
We have this idea that it's only for
good until ai comes live when when

1857
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,670
artificial intelligence
actually becomes sent.

1858
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:10,931
You know,

1859
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:11,764
there's a lot of.

1860
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,600
There's a lot of scientists,

1861
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:16,390
very intelligent people that have
studied this shit their whole life.

1862
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,950
That guy in that movie,

1863
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:21,190
the singularity movie was
Kurzweil's documentary.

1864
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,070
Was it called transcendent?

1865
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,323
Transcendent man.

1866
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,290
There's a guy in England is terrified
of what he calls artilects artificial

1867
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:29,950
intellects.

1868
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,430
He's terrified of the possibility
of them actually getting to a point

1869
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:37,240
technologically where they can think
for themselves and shut things off and

1870
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:39,940
create new ones and create
new artificial intelligence.

1871
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:42,880
It's more powerful and with
more potential than they have,

1872
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,230
but this is all real.

1873
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:44,861
Very,

1874
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:45,730
very possible.

1875
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,930
You can't say no like this
is 100 percent possible.

1876
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,561
It's scary.

1877
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:49,690
No,

1878
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:50,110
it's no.

1879
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:50,380
It's not.

1880
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,040
So technology is available.

1881
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:52,571
Yeah,

1882
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,240
but it's not always good for this.

1883
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,571
I mean,

1884
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:56,404
it's good.

1885
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,880
It is what the universe is,

1886
00:58:57,881 --> 00:58:59,410
which is ever complex.

1887
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,120
Just complexification on top
of complexification keeps
moving in that direction.

1888
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:04,960
It doesn't stop,

1889
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:05,561
you know,

1890
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:08,560
stars explode and they eventually
become fucking human beings.

1891
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:08,801
I mean,

1892
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:12,790
all of this is coming from this idea
that things get more and more complex and

1893
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:13,660
more and more crazy,

1894
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:16,420
but might not necessarily
be good for humans.

1895
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,670
Technology might be terrible for humans.

1896
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,950
We might just be the
rats that build the raft.

1897
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,060
Well might just be the monkeys
that start the computer life form.

1898
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:30,470
They start the artificial ones and
zero life on and we say it's not real,

1899
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,990
but it becomes real when you make it real.

1900
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:37,610
If artificial intelligence actually
becomes sentience than it is real.

1901
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,230
That's a real life form and we just
don't think of it and respect it like,

1902
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:42,550
oh,

1903
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:46,640
like we would in alien life form because
we think of it as something that we

1904
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:48,590
have control over because
we just shut the power off.

1905
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,510
We just turn the switches on for now.

1906
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,340
That's all true at some
point that goes away.

1907
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:52,791
But yeah,

1908
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:56,960
if you give that the computer program
that you create the initiative to act on

1909
00:59:56,961 --> 01:00:01,430
its own and it's much more intelligent
than you are that things might get crazy.

1910
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:01,791
Oh No,

1911
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:02,810
they are going to get crazy,

1912
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,650
but that's not good.

1913
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,670
It's not good for us.

1914
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:05,121
Well,

1915
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:08,000
I don't think that's going to be
good for all the dumb fucks that.

1916
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,421
Yeah,

1917
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:11,300
but then you're like the person
with the rotary telephone saying,

1918
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:11,511
oh,

1919
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:12,410
those cell phones,

1920
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:13,220
they're crazy.

1921
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,300
They're bad for you.

1922
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:14,691
Well,

1923
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:14,961
yes,

1924
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:15,794
to a certain extent.

1925
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,180
You know,

1926
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,570
if you talk to people that
live in the mountains,

1927
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:18,800
they still stand by that shit.

1928
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:23,270
You're fucking yourself up with all those
cell phone signals and you don't need

1929
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:24,830
to check your email every five minutes,

1930
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,443
but you know,

1931
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:31,010
this when we might be is
just a step along the way.

1932
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:31,191
I mean,

1933
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:32,300
me surely are right.

1934
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:32,811
I mean,

1935
01:00:32,811 --> 01:00:34,190
we look at evolution.

1936
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:37,490
We look at these new fossils they just
discovered today where there was a,

1937
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,850
or it was just a news release today about,

1938
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:41,180
uh,

1939
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,013
some,

1940
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:47,600
some hominoid that was a distant relative
of ours that was upright and walking 6

1941
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,410
million years ago.

1942
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:49,700
It was pretty radical discovery.

1943
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:50,540
They're figuring this out.

1944
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:51,703
Just think of that.

1945
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,260
Six million years ago there
was some fucking monkey thing,

1946
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,820
and then 6 million years later,

1947
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:56,470
boom,

1948
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:00,470
unr sitting in front of giant laptops
and ones and Zeros are flying around,

1949
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,420
know,

1950
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,220
through these pipes and wires
and shit under the ocean.

1951
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,190
And whoa,

1952
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,360
it's getting fast.

1953
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:06,830
Yeah.

1954
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,330
It's always getting faster
and faster and faster.

1955
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:10,530
You know what?

1956
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,740
That's what tempts me to be scared,

1957
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:13,690
should be,

1958
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,890
is that we're going to get to this point.

1959
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:19,110
We're going to the technological
singularity coming in what 20 years we,

1960
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,550
and this is the implication of that when
we have a computer that's smarter than

1961
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:23,930
the human brain and in a sense we've,

1962
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,510
that's like an arbitrary benchmark,

1963
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,180
you know,

1964
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,490
a more significant benchmark.

1965
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:31,190
That in a way is not a benchmark
because as soon as we have,

1966
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:31,820
you know,

1967
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,361
the wheel,

1968
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,030
we're able to use that to get rate,

1969
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,270
get more technology,

1970
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:35,540
you know,

1971
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:39,680
every innovation builds on
the previous innovations.

1972
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,120
But in a sense we get to the point where
we have computers that we tell design

1973
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:45,680
the next smarter computer design,

1974
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:50,660
the next Margaret computer chip and we're
already kind of at that point and then

1975
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:52,220
it takes off this exponential curve.

1976
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,060
Next thing you know,

1977
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:53,311
we're,

1978
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:54,640
we're telling computers how to solve,

1979
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,770
instructing these things to solve
and they're going to tell us gay shit

1980
01:01:57,771 --> 01:01:58,041
together,

1981
01:01:58,041 --> 01:01:58,680
bitch.

1982
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,330
You know,

1983
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:02,570
what I'm scared of is that like right
now we see in the news they have this

1984
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:07,190
laser that can hit your scan and do a
molecular analysis from 100 feet away and

1985
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,910
the Tsa is going to have this and be
able to tell what bowl breakfast that

1986
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:11,150
morning.

1987
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:11,983
It's crazy,

1988
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:15,020
but it scares me to see that
that's in the government's hands.

1989
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,460
But at the same time I'm,

1990
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,960
I'm so confident,

1991
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,321
you know,

1992
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:19,154
and like I said,

1993
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:23,180
is going to get scary and at some point
every surface surrounding this is going

1994
01:02:23,181 --> 01:02:27,300
to be a touchscreen and you virtual
reality merges with reality and then who

1995
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:27,541
knows,

1996
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,840
but now we're going to have to jump ahead
and started talking about my last dmt

1997
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:33,690
experience because it
really relates to that.

1998
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,010
But what we're,

1999
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:37,860
what we're coming to is there's going
to be a point where basically everybody

2000
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:38,970
gets a therapy robot.

2001
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:39,804
That's my prediction.

2002
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:40,621
And in a way,

2003
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:42,000
you know what I thought about this.

2004
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:44,820
Every single trend that I look
at like way into the future.

2005
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,390
Uh,

2006
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:45,691
I go,

2007
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:46,171
wait a second.

2008
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:47,190
How is it already happening now?

2009
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,024
And in a sense,

2010
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,270
think about how much therapy and
psychological benefit people get from the

2011
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:51,601
Internet.

2012
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,070
The fact that they can
look shit up and go,

2013
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:53,950
oh,

2014
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,400
I know I have issues because of this.

2015
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,470
Or they're able to find communities,

2016
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:03,360
people that work through their issues in
a way it's able to develop issues more

2017
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:07,580
likely than a KKK website.

2018
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,910
I fucking sleep with a laptop in my bed.

2019
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:15,990
That's the percentage of what's being
done on the Internet is not educational in

2020
01:03:15,991 --> 01:03:16,741
one way or another.

2021
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:17,001
I mean the,

2022
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:17,120
the,

2023
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,430
the potential for education exists.

2024
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:23,220
But compare what's happening majority
station with the Internet compared to what

2025
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,063
happened.

2026
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,100
Everything's accelerating,

2027
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,290
whether it's entertainment or education.

2028
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,160
Kids are smarter today.

2029
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:30,840
They have more access
to information today,

2030
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:31,500
less,

2031
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,560
less viable to be sucked in by propaganda.

2032
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,040
This,

2033
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:35,331
this,

2034
01:03:35,331 --> 01:03:35,481
uh,

2035
01:03:35,481 --> 01:03:36,690
it's a different time.

2036
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,880
We live in a time that's
just is unprecedented.

2037
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:39,540
This is,

2038
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,291
we're in the,

2039
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,280
we're in the wild west.

2040
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,200
We're in the wild west of technology.

2041
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,540
Each time we look back in human history,

2042
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:46,710
we're going to see this as the,

2043
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,260
as the point at which we
hit the vertical asymptote.

2044
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,330
That's what the next 20,

2045
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:55,140
30 years it's going to be that curve and
the and the exponential growth curve.

2046
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:56,760
That is the human experience.

2047
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:59,610
I call it the roaring twenties
of the technological age.

2048
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,990
That's what I take where we're at.

2049
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,260
I think we're in the roaring twenties
of the technological age because I think

2050
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:04,741
they're right now.

2051
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:07,920
We still don't really have a handle on
what this fucking thinking that actually

2052
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:08,520
do,

2053
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:08,820
you know,

2054
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:09,140
instilled.

2055
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:12,720
There's all clunky things like
windows run time errors and you know,

2056
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,270
hundreds of thousands
of computer viruses and.

2057
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,343
But what's going,

2058
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:21,420
what's going on with Brian has
to talk to the AC guy leaves.

2059
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,310
I'm glad I dress for the warm weather.

2060
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,361
Yeah.

2061
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:30,380
We have some funky air conditioning
issues here at the ice house,

2062
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:31,290
so we're trying to work out.

2063
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,050
It's funny that you call it the ice
house and it's hot as fuck in here.

2064
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,950
I went through that bad joke routine in
my head on the way over here today is

2065
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:39,030
much better than yesterday though.

2066
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,230
Yesterday was pretty brutal.

2067
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:41,790
I don't know how people do Vegas,

2068
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:42,130
man.

2069
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,600
I don't think I could do 120
degrees that you step outside.

2070
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:49,200
It's like getting hit in the face with
a hairdryer solution for seven months.

2071
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:49,500
Man.

2072
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,333
What's that like?

2073
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,590
You don't notice over 1:15,

2074
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,770
you just sort of like real and it's
the same way for like with me for weed,

2075
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:56,011
you know,

2076
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:58,080
you get so high and they kind of Plateau.

2077
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:58,980
It's like above,

2078
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,170
above about 115 degrees Fahrenheit.

2079
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:03,630
The human body and the desert
can't really tell the difference.

2080
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:07,140
There are times when you inhale fire,

2081
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:07,441
you know,

2082
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:08,430
from a hot breeze.

2083
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:09,360
But really it's just,

2084
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,673
you're just hot.

2085
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,980
Were you over there without
Pat Tillman was killed.

2086
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,110
He was in Afghanistan.

2087
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,220
He was in Afghanistan.

2088
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:17,680
But when I.

2089
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,540
Did you hear the news
when you were over there?

2090
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,680
Uh,

2091
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,160
you know what?

2092
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,330
Because I remember that unfolding.

2093
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:23,500
I was there in 2004.

2094
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:26,700
You want me to look it up because I
wasn't always remember what you felt like

2095
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:27,740
when you were heard.

2096
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,340
Like all the shit that went down
when they tried to say it was,

2097
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,140
he was killed in action and it
was really friendly back then.

2098
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:34,370
I,

2099
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:34,601
you know,

2100
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:35,434
I was asleep,

2101
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:35,880
you know,

2102
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,190
I was,

2103
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:37,320
I was one of the sheep.

2104
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:37,751
Really.

2105
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:38,441
I wasn't,

2106
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:39,250
uh,

2107
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,750
I wasn't politically attuned.

2108
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:42,490
So when I heard the store and was like,

2109
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:43,360
I acknowledged it,

2110
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:46,420
but I wasn't really find that hard to
believe you're very articulate guy.

2111
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:46,631
I mean,

2112
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:47,464
he can't,

2113
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,590
even if you're obsessed
with all this information,

2114
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,930
there's no way that you would be
a stupid person when you're young

2115
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:56,111
to believe in it.

2116
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:56,380
And I,

2117
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,213
you know,

2118
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,210
you're susceptible.

2119
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,970
We should step back and maybe
for a minute and talk about this,

2120
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:01,451
this,

2121
01:06:01,451 --> 01:06:01,710
uh,

2122
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:06,710
this podcast because there are a lot of
people and I want to get a shout out to

2123
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,080
Michael Salvey for making it possible
for me to come out here because there are

2124
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,870
a lot of people like him in my audience
that they really cared about me getting

2125
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:15,100
to have a conversation with you.

2126
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,320
And there are a,

2127
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,193
you know,

2128
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:22,300
in a way I really look
up to you and I feel like

2129
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,280
as much as my audience wants you to
benefit from hearing my perspective right

2130
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:31,070
now and talk about what I'm,

2131
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:31,620
what,

2132
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:36,070
what we refer to ourselves as awake to
our understanding of government society,

2133
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:36,550
you know,

2134
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,383
I want to,

2135
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,263
uh,

2136
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:38,650
you know,

2137
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:38,900
you're,

2138
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,240
you're 14 years ahead of me,

2139
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:41,074
but you're like,

2140
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:41,640
you know,

2141
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:41,901
I want,

2142
01:06:41,901 --> 01:06:42,590
I want to,

2143
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:45,070
I want to learn something from you
almost want to be interviewing you.

2144
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,130
But I think we all were
learning from each other.

2145
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:48,371
I mean,

2146
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,620
you saying that you look up to me is,

2147
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,640
it's always funny to me when people say
things like that because I think the

2148
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:59,860
reality of it is we all inspire each
other and it's great when we run into

2149
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:02,530
someone who we really feel
like is on the right path.

2150
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:02,771
Like,

2151
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:03,431
fuck man,

2152
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:04,630
you're out there doing it,

2153
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,231
you know,

2154
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:07,660
and we benefit from each other.

2155
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:08,141
All of us.

2156
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:08,500
Do,

2157
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,040
you know,

2158
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:09,873
that's just,

2159
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:11,013
that's,

2160
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:13,030
that's the good thing about the internet.

2161
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,330
That's a great thing about the end of the
Internet connect people like you and I

2162
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,820
were in past years.

2163
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:20,350
It would be so impossible.

2164
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,930
This is that we exchanged
a couple series of tweets.

2165
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,880
We don't even talk to each
other face to face too.

2166
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:25,780
We're actually saying no,

2167
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:26,801
I mean that's a,

2168
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:27,634
that's a crazy,

2169
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,690
crazy world.

2170
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,500
So in that sense it does amazing things,

2171
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:34,420
but we were all.

2172
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,760
Everybody has a part in this thing is
one of the things I was going to say

2173
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,511
earlier when you were,

2174
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,344
um,

2175
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:38,860
when,

2176
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,460
when you were talking about people
and the human mind and the power of a

2177
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:43,270
computer,

2178
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:47,710
the crazy thing about people is not just
the power of the human mind is the fact

2179
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:51,550
that we can figure out how
to work together because
the only way a computer gets

2180
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:55,540
made is if somebody figures out how to
make all the different parts of it and

2181
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:58,450
figure out how to integrate them
together and make it work together.

2182
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,380
There's a lot.

2183
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,630
That's a lot of motherfuckers.

2184
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,170
That's not one dude figuring out how to
Code Algorithms and figuring out how to

2185
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,670
send packets or the Internet.

2186
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:06,821
No,

2187
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:08,500
this is like a bunch of people.

2188
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:13,240
Everyone has a specific task
and guys like you have a task,

2189
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,830
guys like me have a task.

2190
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,960
We all have that

2191
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,560
task is what?

2192
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:18,980
What are you drawn towards?

2193
01:08:18,981 --> 01:08:21,080
And even if it's fucking
playing basketball,

2194
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,550
if that's what you love to do,

2195
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,490
and if you're fucking thinking
about basketball all the time,

2196
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,090
your,

2197
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,781
that's your thing,

2198
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:27,170
man.

2199
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:27,741
That's not a,

2200
01:08:27,741 --> 01:08:28,910
it's not a bad thing.

2201
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:31,240
Standup comedy is a ridiculous pursuit.

2202
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:32,130
You just making people laugh.

2203
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,140
That's not still,

2204
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,220
it's not a bad thing.

2205
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,730
You in lane people and
your comedy sets you apart.

2206
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:39,320
It's not enlightened.

2207
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:39,621
It's,

2208
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:44,621
I tell them shit that I heard you
share a very valuable and empowering

2209
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:45,884
perspective.

2210
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,033
Uh,

2211
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,000
I'm happy that that's the case for me.

2212
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:50,231
It was,

2213
01:08:50,231 --> 01:08:50,451
you know,

2214
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:52,760
that that's true and I appreciate it.

2215
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:53,301
I appreciate that.

2216
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:55,820
That's the case for
your masturbation jokes,

2217
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,660
you know,

2218
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:56,940
in,

2219
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,220
in,

2220
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:01,580
in today's repressed age are empowering
the people that are afraid to talk about

2221
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:02,150
those things.

2222
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:02,421
Well,

2223
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:03,290
I think that,

2224
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,090
you know,

2225
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:04,420
the,

2226
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:08,960
the lessons and the battles that you go
through in your life where you figure

2227
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,000
out what stupid and what's empowering,

2228
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:16,001
what's good and what's bad for you not
to have a perspective when you get to be

2229
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,360
a certain age.

2230
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:21,350
We hit 44 years old and not have some
shit figured out that you didn't have when

2231
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:21,861
you were 25.

2232
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:22,700
This is ridiculous.

2233
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,030
But from,

2234
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:24,741
for me,

2235
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:28,510
it's like when whenever someone would
say they look up to me or you know,

2236
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:28,851
hey man,

2237
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:29,684
you changed my life.

2238
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,670
I would say like I'm not going to antenna.

2239
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,570
Okay.

2240
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,800
I'm just antenna for all the
shit that's out there in,

2241
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:38,090
in this crazy fucking weird world.

2242
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,740
So when I repeat shit back or when I
analyze and add a bunch of shit together

2243
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:43,270
that I've,

2244
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:44,900
that I've read that other
people have figured out,

2245
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,750
someone saying they look up to that.

2246
01:09:46,751 --> 01:09:49,030
It's a very weird thing
to hear because it's just,

2247
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:51,530
I'm just just dealing the stuff,

2248
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,070
you know,

2249
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:54,140
just doing comedy or doing podcasts.

2250
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:54,974
It's not a,

2251
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:58,700
it doesn't ever seem like
a anything important,

2252
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:04,250
but when you get the overwhelming amount
of response that this podcast gets on

2253
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:05,860
twitter and you know,

2254
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,950
and whatever,

2255
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:07,641
anything on the Internet,

2256
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:08,310
my master port,

2257
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,500
it can fuck with your head.

2258
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,360
It gets kinda tricky.

2259
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:12,230
You feel like you got
this weird obligation,

2260
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,350
you know enough people
come up to you and say,

2261
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,710
the Ama changed my life.

2262
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:16,521
You start going,

2263
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:16,761
man,

2264
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:18,700
maybe I should start a fucking cult.

2265
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,270
Big Ass.

2266
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,430
Maybe that's my move man.

2267
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,540
Big Ass plot of land in Brazil somewhere.

2268
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,350
Just tell everybody.

2269
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,410
Well fuck this country.

2270
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:28,460
Let's move man.

2271
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:29,721
We could run shit.

2272
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:30,554
Nice down there.

2273
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,330
So the air conditioner,

2274
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,173
the weather's beautiful.

2275
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:36,830
The air conditioner outside is being
worked on and should be done in like 30

2276
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:37,111
minutes.

2277
01:10:37,111 --> 01:10:38,360
So they're going to turn
it off for 30 minutes.

2278
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:39,500
But when I walked out I was like,

2279
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,490
so how long is it going to take?

2280
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:41,360
And this is what I saw.

2281
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:42,050
Look at that.

2282
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:42,883
We'll watch this.

2283
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:44,683
See right here.

2284
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,643
He's got.

2285
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,430
He do.

2286
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,910
Don't put that on the Internet.

2287
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,950
That's the guy that's told them.

2288
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:54,500
You're going to put that
on the Internet please.

2289
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,161
By the way,

2290
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:57,020
we should tell the
federal federal rallies.

2291
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:01,130
He is a licensed patient
here in California.

2292
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,091
What do you think of that,

2293
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:02,241
man?

2294
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:03,470
That's a creepy thing.

2295
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:05,090
When we had a Tommy Chong on,

2296
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:05,840
we've talked about that.

2297
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,640
We said it was basically a money grab.

2298
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:11,640
These dea agents that are rating these
California dispensary's even though in

2299
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:12,830
the California state law,

2300
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,220
medical marijuana is legal,

2301
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,090
there are allowed to sell it.

2302
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:15,924
They're allowed to have it.

2303
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:16,430
Dude,

2304
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:17,360
just for you,

2305
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:18,470
just for you today.

2306
01:11:18,471 --> 01:11:21,860
I went and I got my
license from Dr Winkler,

2307
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:22,490
md.

2308
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:23,730
Shouldn't say the doctor's name.

2309
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:26,840
TheSe doctors are all undercover.

2310
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:27,140
Oh,

2311
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:27,651
he's cool.

2312
01:11:27,651 --> 01:11:28,101
That's the thing.

2313
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:29,060
It's all legit now.

2314
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:29,451
Oh really?

2315
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:29,610
No,

2316
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:30,111
and I was.

2317
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:34,820
I was afraid that what we were going
to see was this and it is a ridiculous

2318
01:11:34,821 --> 01:11:38,480
cottage industry of writing medical
marijuana prescription and I was thinking,

2319
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:39,051
oh,

2320
01:11:39,051 --> 01:11:43,730
it's a shame that this is a diversion
of legitimate medical care resources and

2321
01:11:43,731 --> 01:11:44,720
to a certain extent it is,

2322
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,430
but this is.

2323
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:49,880
He was the nicest old dude and when he
came out of retirement to help patients

2324
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:50,450
all day,

2325
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:51,230
just chilling,

2326
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:51,441
you know,

2327
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:51,771
and you know,

2328
01:11:51,771 --> 01:11:54,320
he does get to help patients
occasionally as he says,

2329
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:54,771
but you know,

2330
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:57,050
because there's a lot of people that
just come in for their paperwork,

2331
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:57,560
you know,

2332
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,730
he's just writing scripts all day,

2333
01:11:58,731 --> 01:11:59,061
but you know,

2334
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:02,540
it's karma and that man to
be a doctor and do that.

2335
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,220
There's,

2336
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:03,570
yeah,

2337
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,640
because you're turning the guns,

2338
01:12:04,641 --> 01:12:06,590
the government away from people
you're covering for people.

2339
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:08,330
And it's funny in Colorado though,

2340
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,290
where it's not as well established.

2341
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:13,170
So it hasn't been subjected
to market forces for as long.

2342
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,230
The doctor still charged $200,

2343
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:19,730
but my doctor charges more than
the 35 minutes to write a referral.

2344
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,030
I don't wanna I don't want to say my
doctor's name because I don't want anybody

2345
01:12:23,031 --> 01:12:25,660
to get mad at them on the
outside of the building.

2346
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,520
He went to jail for it.

2347
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:29,810
And um,

2348
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,690
he uh,

2349
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:33,060
he did time and leave you.

2350
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:33,411
I don't want,

2351
01:12:33,411 --> 01:12:34,021
if you went to jail for.

2352
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:34,854
I know he's arrested.

2353
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,960
I know he lost his license
and he had given back.

2354
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:38,890
It was during the beginning
of the medical marijuana.

2355
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:39,421
It's funny.

2356
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,030
Back then you could use lose your
license for being involved in this.

2357
01:12:42,031 --> 01:12:44,040
Now you have to use your license

2358
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,780
to get people pot.

2359
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,201
Well,

2360
01:12:46,201 --> 01:12:46,920
yOu know,

2361
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,100
I,

2362
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,960
I was turned onto the whole medical
marijuana scene in part by my friend todd

2363
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:52,501
mccormick.

2364
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:57,501
Do you know todd taught store my friend
todd is a really brilliant guy when it

2365
01:12:57,541 --> 01:13:01,700
comes to any knowledge of cannabis or
hamper the history behind it and the

2366
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:04,110
suppression of it had cancer himself,

2367
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:04,963
you know,

2368
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,480
he needs marijuana.

2369
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:07,314
Like literally,

2370
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,280
you know,

2371
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,200
and knowing him,

2372
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:15,120
I got to meet all sorts of people
like that that are inside the medical

2373
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:20,040
community and most of them
are doing a great service.

2374
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:20,431
You know,

2375
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:23,760
most of 'em are getting
weed to people and you know,

2376
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,290
there's nothing wrong with that,

2377
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,130
but there's a few of them out there
that it just like the people in northern

2378
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:31,420
California saying we should keep it
illegal because they make more money.

2379
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:32,351
Oh yeah.

2380
01:13:32,351 --> 01:13:33,630
That's big,

2381
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,021
isn't it?

2382
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:37,270
That just shows you how twisted government
is that somebody's always benefits

2383
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:37,381
in,

2384
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:38,940
wants to benefit from the violence.

2385
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:42,240
It's just sad that anybody would ever
want a profit on keeping something from.

2386
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,940
From everybody when I know it
would be good for everybody.

2387
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:48,090
You know the fact that you would vote
against legalization while you're selling

2388
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:48,421
pot.

2389
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:49,254
It's like,

2390
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:49,681
man,

2391
01:13:49,681 --> 01:13:50,600
that's not good for you.

2392
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,410
You're making a real creepy decision,

2393
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,244
man.

2394
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,950
Burning you would still be okay.

2395
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:58,320
Everybody thinks that like people
are going to grow the wheat.

2396
01:13:58,321 --> 01:13:59,340
I'm not going to grow my weight.

2397
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,750
What I pay fOr weed right now,

2398
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:01,381
it's perfect.

2399
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:02,430
I'll keep paying that forever.

2400
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:02,970
You don't need it.

2401
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,110
Nobody has to lose any money.

2402
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:05,940
You don't have to be country
about this whole thing.

2403
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:07,560
It's just completely ridiculous.

2404
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,381
How many people are going gonna?

2405
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:09,300
Start a weed farm.

2406
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:10,134
Really

2407
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:11,980
kNow pot heads out of that

2408
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,760
kind of ambition.

2409
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,470
Well,

2410
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:14,171
if they want to,

2411
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:14,951
they should be able to.

2412
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:15,281
Man,

2413
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:16,840
If you want to grow fucking tomatoes,

2414
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:17,950
you should be able to grow tomatoes.

2415
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:18,784
It should be legal.

2416
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:18,980
well,

2417
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,230
it's going to be like
who would grow tobacco?

2418
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:21,890
You know?

2419
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,090
Eventually that's what it's going to be,

2420
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:23,511
but I want,

2421
01:14:23,511 --> 01:14:23,820
I want,

2422
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,930
I want to tell a little story about my
experience this morning because I haven't

2423
01:14:26,931 --> 01:14:27,800
really had a blast.

2424
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:32,240
We went right across the street to
la confidential and it's one of the

2425
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:35,130
dispensary's in the
hollywood area and in place.

2426
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,280
I want to give them a shout out.

2427
01:14:37,281 --> 01:14:39,020
This was a real operate confidential.

2428
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:39,111
have,

2429
01:14:39,111 --> 01:14:39,681
you know,

2430
01:14:39,681 --> 01:14:40,311
I guess not,

2431
01:14:40,311 --> 01:14:40,671
and I'm going to,

2432
01:14:40,671 --> 01:14:42,470
I'm going to call out people
by name because they were.

2433
01:14:42,471 --> 01:14:43,150
They were awesome.

2434
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:43,581
Okay,

2435
01:14:43,581 --> 01:14:43,691
cool.

2436
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:44,211
And they said,

2437
01:14:44,211 --> 01:14:46,670
they said that they're not allowed to.

2438
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:47,930
You're setting a precedent.

2439
01:14:47,931 --> 01:14:50,120
You will have to give shout
outs all the time from now on.

2440
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:50,540
Well,

2441
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:51,230
anybody stops.

2442
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:53,170
You also have.

2443
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:57,350
You'll also see I have an ulterior
motive here because the guy at the front,

2444
01:14:57,351 --> 01:15:00,980
his name was jeff and he looked like the
character from south park who's dead.

2445
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,470
I'll just sad,

2446
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,250
sad.

2447
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:04,821
I'm sorry.

2448
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:07,010
I didn't mean to derail my
story with that tragedy.

2449
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:07,221
No,

2450
01:15:07,221 --> 01:15:08,680
I did it real.

2451
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,900
I was just thinking about the cartoon,

2452
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,033
but anyways,

2453
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:13,790
he was,

2454
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:14,211
he was,

2455
01:15:14,211 --> 01:15:14,410
uh,

2456
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:14,680
you know,

2457
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,430
we weren't allowed to film in there and
they were very professional about it and

2458
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,330
who was understandable and
they had a no cellphone policy,

2459
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:21,170
but they had,

2460
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:21,580
they had,

2461
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,910
they have a separate bar in the back.

2462
01:15:22,911 --> 01:15:23,700
so at first I went,

2463
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,560
I talked to this,

2464
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:26,150
a lovely young woman,

2465
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:26,984
mickey,

2466
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:28,850
and this is my ulterior motive.

2467
01:15:28,851 --> 01:15:30,560
I'm kind of hoping that
by giving her a shout out,

2468
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:31,730
she will actually call me,

2469
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:32,231
oh,

2470
01:15:32,231 --> 01:15:33,860
you're trying to get laid on this show.

2471
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:34,700
That's ridiculous.

2472
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:35,803
How dare you.

2473
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,560
And it's such a mad struggle
and don't ever do that.

2474
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:40,940
That's a terrible idea.

2475
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:42,190
Terrible idea.

2476
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:42,851
She'd never do that.

2477
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:46,090
If you can't get laid without mentioning
a chicken here or even get to her to

2478
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:46,900
hang out with you,

2479
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,700
how much interest could she possibly have?

2480
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,150
The last thing you want to do is give
a shout out on the air because what if

2481
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:52,984
this doesn't work out?

2482
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:54,190
What if this doesn't work out?

2483
01:15:54,191 --> 01:15:55,630
And then like a year from now,

2484
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:57,610
your new wife who you
love more than anything,

2485
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,330
you're like,

2486
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,620
you gotta listen to this tape.

2487
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,330
This is me on the joe rogan podcast.

2488
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:01,870
Was like,

2489
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:02,111
wow,

2490
01:16:02,111 --> 01:16:02,980
this is so amazing.

2491
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,360
Who the fuck is nikki?

2492
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,553
Who's nicky?

2493
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:06,461
Well,

2494
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,110
nicky.

2495
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,260
Nicky didn't work out.

2496
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:08,800
She didn't.

2497
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:08,951
I,

2498
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:09,251
yeah,

2499
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:10,690
I gave her a shout out,

2500
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:11,524
but she didn't.

2501
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,420
She didn't go out with me like you.

2502
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,870
You're still lose hope and you.

2503
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,530
I do want to give a shout out to asa,

2504
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:21,550
akira and tara patrick that we'll
just call you for no reason.

2505
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,100
Just for no reason.

2506
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:26,050
Just giving shout outs to hot porn stars.

2507
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:27,810
Oh there you brian.

2508
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,300
I went to.

2509
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,700
She was great and this was great.

2510
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,290
The customer service is really incredible.

2511
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:33,400
It's my first time buying,

2512
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:34,031
but I had gone to.

2513
01:16:34,031 --> 01:16:34,721
They're all high man.

2514
01:16:34,721 --> 01:16:35,770
They're going to be real friendly.

2515
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,950
I went to the club and
breckenridge in Colorado,

2516
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,000
the breckenridge cannabis club.

2517
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:42,910
And for my youtube channel we did a
recording with my friend job weeks there

2518
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,310
with his new local
currency mountain hours.

2519
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:46,180
This was really exciting.

2520
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:46,470
Yeah.

2521
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,850
So they explained that they,

2522
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:53,851
they have their own talk about monetary
policy because this was really awesome,

2523
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:55,720
but mickey was,

2524
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:56,551
was really helpful.

2525
01:16:56,551 --> 01:16:57,231
I got as a,

2526
01:16:57,231 --> 01:16:58,630
as a first time or discount,

2527
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:03,350
a free hit of hash and I had
never had this before where they,

2528
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:06,750
they use the blow torch over
the little metal device in,

2529
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:10,190
into the front of the bomb
and they gave me two half

2530
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,820
hits that were like for me,

2531
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:12,561
a huge,

2532
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:15,680
huge rips of hash that knocked me on
my ass and they have this beautiful

2533
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,180
smoker's lounge in the bag.

2534
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:17,811
Jake was there,

2535
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:18,501
very helpful.

2536
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:18,810
It was a,

2537
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,180
it was a wonderful experIence.

2538
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,160
And I asked them if there was,

2539
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,530
if I could plug their
business and they said,

2540
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:26,510
well we can't tell you
what to say but you know,

2541
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:26,781
I said,

2542
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:26,991
is there,

2543
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:29,570
is there any message
that you want to get out?

2544
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:30,620
And they said get involved,

2545
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:30,891
you know.

2546
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:34,010
And I think that's really cool to see
that most people aren't like those growers

2547
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:34,880
in northern California.

2548
01:17:34,881 --> 01:17:36,680
They want people to get
involved in the issue.

2549
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:37,590
They want people working in,

2550
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:38,040
as he's,

2551
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,410
as chef specifically said,

2552
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,640
you know what,

2553
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,160
this could be if it was fully legal,

2554
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,350
classify what you're saying.

2555
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:48,110
The reason why the people are in
northern California or intuit is because

2556
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:49,160
they're selling it illegally.

2557
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,260
They they want it to stay illegal.

2558
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,590
They will either a lot of them,

2559
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,830
but the grower,

2560
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,810
the growers that are
selling to dispensary's,

2561
01:17:56,811 --> 01:17:58,910
they're not the ones who
are voting against legality.

2562
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,920
A lot of it is the guys
who've been doing it,

2563
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:03,980
old school where it's just
completely accepted up there.

2564
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:08,840
I mean a big part of humboldt county
is comedy is based on marijuana.

2565
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,780
That has just a fact and it's
just been sort of accepted,

2566
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:14,780
but now not so much,

2567
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:15,020
you know,

2568
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,060
now it's a.

2569
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:20,870
Then they also had the problem
with mexican gangs that
are running these forest.

2570
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,190
They set up these things
in national forest,

2571
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,060
but put up these farms.

2572
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:28,640
Even the people here in the dispensary's
have an interest in the law,

2573
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:29,630
not changing.

2574
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,471
You know what I'm saying?

2575
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:34,370
Like they haven't because it know if it's
fully legalized they just switch over

2576
01:18:34,371 --> 01:18:36,080
and start selling it
or they have the same.

2577
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:36,321
No,

2578
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:37,160
they have the same,

2579
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,020
the same bullshit.

2580
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:42,380
Financial interest in the
current government restricted
system that the people

2581
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:44,120
in northern California
too and and most people.

2582
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:46,370
My point is most people are good
people and the people that are like

2583
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:47,900
confidential are good people.

2584
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,700
Somebody I think you're saying that you
believe that you know how everyone who

2585
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:55,480
runs a dispensary thinks
and you know you can't.

2586
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,960
It's real hard to say that,

2587
01:18:56,961 --> 01:18:57,794
that they know.

2588
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,890
I'm just saying my sense no,

2589
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:02,000
because I do know other people
that are involved in the industry,

2590
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,910
but that's not necessarily bad for them.

2591
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:05,810
If it becomes legal,

2592
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:07,460
they just can open up a weed shop.

2593
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:11,050
They can switch from a
medical dispensary slash no,

2594
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:11,660
no,

2595
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:11,870
no,

2596
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,310
because it'll be more commercialized.

2597
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:15,560
There'll be selling it at a
walmart in the cigarette section.

2598
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:16,131
You know what I mean?

2599
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,350
Like or with liquor stores it'll be,

2600
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:18,971
it'll be,

2601
01:19:18,971 --> 01:19:20,360
it will be specialty shops,

2602
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:22,520
but there was more
competition you'll have,

2603
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:26,000
you'll end up in more legalization will
end up with a greater consolidation in

2604
01:19:26,001 --> 01:19:26,540
the market.

2605
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,160
I don't necessarily think that's the case.

2606
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:30,080
If it's to sell weed,

2607
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:30,690
why?

2608
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:33,110
I mean why would it have to be so
expensive that you'd have to go through

2609
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:34,940
walmart with its thousand employees?

2610
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:36,860
Why you could sell weed.

2611
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:38,060
You could have like little locally,

2612
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:38,894
locally.

2613
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,670
There would be more.

2614
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:41,740
There will be more competition.

2615
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,050
Wonder,

2616
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:44,750
I wonder how long it would
take before marijuana is legal.

2617
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:47,480
As before coca cola gotten
business and started saying,

2618
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:47,961
listen man,

2619
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:48,440
we need to.

2620
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:48,790
You know,

2621
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:49,623
there's a big business.

2622
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:50,543
Let's get a piece.

2623
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:54,500
It's really fun to apply the economics
of this and then you start to understand

2624
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:58,280
why the violence is happening in Mexico
because their business is being shredded

2625
01:19:58,281 --> 01:20:01,910
and they're fighting over a
territory that is rapidly shrinking.

2626
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:02,660
I would.

2627
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:03,270
It is.

2628
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:07,980
THat's because marijuana
or drugs are illegal

2629
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:08,813
in this country.

2630
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,170
Swag anymore.

2631
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:12,360
In America it's hard to find it.

2632
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:14,310
Shitty mexican trash compactor.

2633
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:16,350
We'd like the shit I used
to get in high school for,

2634
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:16,800
you know,

2635
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,390
$80 an ounce or whatever it was.

2636
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,430
You can't find that anymore.

2637
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:21,031
I had this epiphany.

2638
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:23,610
I was in Kansas city where it's
as illegal as it is anywhere else.

2639
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:24,500
I was there for,

2640
01:20:24,501 --> 01:20:29,070
for a gig a couple of weeks ago trying
to buy weed and it was like we were

2641
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:29,500
trying to.

2642
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,510
We were joking about it,

2643
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:33,740
but we actually trying to find shitty
weed to see if we could do it and we

2644
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,410
couldn't,

2645
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:34,831
you know,

2646
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,770
I bet east coast you could
still find find in Ohio.

2647
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,650
I got a couple months ago.

2648
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:41,251
It's out there,

2649
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:42,084
you can get it,

2650
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:45,090
but you see how much
it's because when it's,

2651
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,290
when it's illegal in California and
it's still gray market for producers,

2652
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,860
it puts pressure on the market in places
where it's harder to grow and so people

2653
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:56,670
are able to get better weed from the
surplus in California and it's a better

2654
01:20:56,671 --> 01:20:57,300
deal for them.

2655
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,430
Then they get the ship
that's up from Mexico.

2656
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,890
I did comedy at that la confidential.

2657
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:06,240
they used to do a or like a comedy shows
there and I did it with joey dia's,

2658
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:08,610
no,

2659
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,690
la confidential.

2660
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,820
And they have like a stage
in the backyard they used to.

2661
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:13,110
They stopped doing it though I heard.

2662
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,180
Um,

2663
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:17,100
but it was crazy because if
you were on later in the show,

2664
01:21:17,101 --> 01:21:18,390
like I was like second to last,

2665
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:19,050
I was uh,

2666
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,790
right after joey diaz
or something like that.

2667
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,590
A beginning of show was awesome.

2668
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,820
Second part of the show,

2669
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:28,830
everyone was so fucked up from doing hash
and fucking weed and stuff like that.

2670
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,680
Sitting at with drool
coming out of their mouth.

2671
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:34,830
Just looking at the movements
you're doing with your hands too.

2672
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:40,430
Did a show who the fuck
that I do a toronto with?

2673
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,090
It was either a sam trip.

2674
01:21:42,091 --> 01:21:42,391
No,

2675
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:42,890
it wasn't.

2676
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,260
It was the ra should fear at thompson.

2677
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,780
I forget who it was,

2678
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:48,210
but we did it in this place in toronto.

2679
01:21:48,211 --> 01:21:48,950
That's,

2680
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,060
I don't want to say the name because
it's probably illegal what they're doing,

2681
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:55,500
but they have a pot shop and the front
where they sell bongs and shit in the

2682
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:56,160
back.

2683
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,480
They have a hot box,

2684
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,470
this is a hot box.

2685
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,730
Got 100 people boxed in with no
fucking ventilation whatsoever,

2686
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:07,731
and everybody's hitting bongs and
vaporizers and they're passing blunts.

2687
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:12,450
The air is so ridiculously
unhealthy and healthy.

2688
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,600
It's all smoke that can't.

2689
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:15,951
You got to.

2690
01:22:15,951 --> 01:22:17,280
It should be a little smoke,

2691
01:22:17,281 --> 01:22:18,060
a little air,

2692
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,810
a little smoke of this was just nothing
but smoke to the point where the next

2693
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:23,190
day my throat was sore.

2694
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:23,521
I was like,

2695
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:23,851
wow,

2696
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:24,780
I might be fucked.

2697
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:28,200
I was worried that it was going to mess
with my voice because it was nothing but

2698
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:29,490
smoke for like an hour.

2699
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,050
I've never been that high in my life.

2700
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,130
It was ridiculous.

2701
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:32,993
It was so.

2702
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,770
There was so much thc in the air and no,

2703
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:40,740
there was no air was all thc and carbon
dioxide has bad breath and people just

2704
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,050
blitzkrieg I don't even
remember what I talked about.

2705
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,070
I'd bet I did maybe five minutes
of material in an hour onstage.

2706
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:49,020
It was preposterous,

2707
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,640
which is going to be tonight.

2708
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:51,600
Tonight's preposterous.

2709
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:52,320
If you're around.

2710
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:52,951
Ladies and gentlemen,

2711
01:22:52,951 --> 01:22:57,951
tonight we've got a 10:00 PM show at
the ice house comedy club right here in

2712
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:01,710
lovely downtown pasadena where
they've spotted rabid bats.

2713
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,270
So if you have a turtleneck,

2714
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,133
put that shit on.

2715
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,160
You don't want to get
jacked by a rabid bat.

2716
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:06,491
Yeah,

2717
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:08,620
we just released a 20 more tickets.

2718
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:09,140
So good.

2719
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,630
A comedy sitcom.

2720
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:13,060
20 rabid bat bats in here.

2721
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:13,480

2722
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,680

2725

And then there's one already should
fear dom I rera greg fitzsimmons.

2726
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:22,360
Brian red band,

2727
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:23,500

And our host is always a tony
hinchcliffe who's hilarious and me.

2730
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,710
You dirty bitches.

2731
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,020
So that's tonight a 10:00 show.

2732
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,200
And of course we'll also have the ice
house chronicles that go on at the same

2733
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:35,800
time.

2734
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,800
And that is only available on the itunes
desk squad label adam coke cash in for

2735
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:42,970
an ice house.

2736
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:44,800
This is not the coldest place yet.

2737
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:45,920
Yeah,

2738
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,410
we already made those jokes to.

2739
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,303
You weren't in the room.

2740
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:48,810
Yeah,

2741
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:49,690
you were dealing with shit.

2742
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:52,590
That's what hacky material.

2743
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:55,150
Well it's just called parallel thinking.

2744
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:56,620
So don't be so hard on yourself.

2745
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:58,480
So um,

2746
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,710
how long have you been down here for me?

2747
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:00,931
Just for this.

2748
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:01,651
It kind of worked out.

2749
01:24:01,651 --> 01:24:02,780
I don't really realize that,

2750
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:03,631
that it worked out,

2751
01:24:03,631 --> 01:24:07,590
but I was in Colorado for the mountain
hours event and then it was able.

2752
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,580
I was able to come here.

2753
01:24:08,581 --> 01:24:08,920
But.

2754
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,240
Well we got distracted by weed man.

2755
01:24:10,241 --> 01:24:10,751
We were actually,

2756
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:11,584
when you want to tell me about,

2757
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:15,370
I want to hear the currency thing that
you would tell me before the show about

2758
01:24:15,371 --> 01:24:16,720
the they have their own currency.

2759
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:16,950
See?

2760
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:17,190
Well,

2761
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:22,190
well let's come back to that because
we were talking about the perspective,

2762
01:24:22,711 --> 01:24:23,310
you know,

2763
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:24,930
how I used to be asleep,

2764
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:25,923
right.

2765
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:31,010
And how so many in in my audience are
excited to have me appear on your podcast

2766
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,780
and to be able to share this perspective
with you because it's about sharing the

2767
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:39,840
joy of standing out to government,

2768
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:44,130
of standing up to the bully of actually
seeing yourself as part of this process

2769
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,840
of humanity evolving.

2770
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:49,680
And they know that you share
a lot of the premises of this,

2771
01:24:49,681 --> 01:24:49,811
of,

2772
01:24:49,811 --> 01:24:51,600
of distrust for authority of,

2773
01:24:51,601 --> 01:24:52,000
of you.

2774
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,630
You're good understanding
of what government is.

2775
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:54,811
And,

2776
01:24:54,811 --> 01:24:54,991
and,

2777
01:24:54,991 --> 01:24:56,460
and the exploitation behind it,

2778
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,600
but what,

2779
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:02,490
what we're doing is actually working to
change the paradigm and get people more

2780
01:25:02,491 --> 01:25:03,150
involved.

2781
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:07,020
We're not so much a political movement
as an anti political movement and that

2782
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,040
we're not.

2783
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,760
We understand that politics is
pathological behavior when you're,

2784
01:25:11,761 --> 01:25:14,220
when you're advocating for
more government control,

2785
01:25:14,221 --> 01:25:16,740
when you're saying that we
need government to do this and,

2786
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:21,760
and we are helping humanity by spreading
this message that it is a universal

2787
01:25:21,841 --> 01:25:23,630
moral message of that,

2788
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,040
you know,

2789
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:24,601
don't hit,

2790
01:25:24,601 --> 01:25:25,291
don't steal,

2791
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:30,291
not unless you have a badge
or a gun of the government,

2792
01:25:30,631 --> 01:25:30,811
you know,

2793
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:34,500
government is an opinion with a gun and
getting people to see that and move past

2794
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:34,680
that.

2795
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,640
And as,

2796
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,050
as,

2797
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,070
as activists,

2798
01:25:38,071 --> 01:25:38,341
you know,

2799
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:38,980
and it's,

2800
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:42,090
it's funny you talked about what it's
like being a celebrity for yourself and

2801
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:43,150
you know,

2802
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:43,620
you're,

2803
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,940
you're a legitimate celebrity.

2804
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:48,030
And then there's like there's political
celebrity and then there's me minor

2805
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:53,090
political celebrity and I still get some
of the same experience of people having

2806
01:25:53,911 --> 01:25:56,130
a relationship with me
before you meet them and,

2807
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,450
and you know who that is and what,

2808
01:25:59,451 --> 01:25:59,661
what,

2809
01:25:59,661 --> 01:26:00,390
what though,

2810
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,500
what you have with,

2811
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:02,640
with your presence,

2812
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:03,920
your ability

2813
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,260
to get people to get more involved,

2814
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,120
to share this perspective,

2815
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:11,480
to enjoy standing up
to the man that people,

2816
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:15,190
people in your position
can use your presence to,

2817
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:17,660
to better effect this change
and be a part of this.

2818
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:18,830
And I wanted to,

2819
01:26:18,831 --> 01:26:22,280
I wanted to open the podcast by saying
I'm from the revolution and I'm here to

2820
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:23,114
recruit you.

2821
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,860
I don't know how to respond
to that last creepy part.

2822
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:29,720
You're gonna need to work out together,

2823
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:32,803
right?

2824
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,780
Just wants both of us to
leave the room right now.

2825
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:36,861
Begging him.

2826
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:37,694
Uncomfortable.

2827
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,080
There's too much bromance,

2828
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,453
motherfucker.

2829
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,840
Do we cross that line man?

2830
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,330
Smoking a little joint?

2831
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:44,900
Yeah.

2832
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,920
You know man,

2833
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:46,960
that's this one.

2834
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,170
It's very cool for you to.

2835
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:48,321
Yeah,

2836
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:49,250
we can finish that joint.

2837
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:50,240
Where would we put that thing?

2838
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,123
It's in the.

2839
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,840
Don't ask for it.

2840
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,043
You know,

2841
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,990
you know adam can be your new flashlight.

2842
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,980
Oh brian.

2843
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,823
That was just.

2844
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,240
That was so stupid that that's one of
those things where you remember when you

2845
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:06,620
did that show the other
day and you're like,

2846
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:06,981
man,

2847
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:07,191
people,

2848
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:08,090
they didn't know who I was.

2849
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:08,870
They hated me.

2850
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:09,260
Yeah.

2851
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,060
That's how normal person
where you're asked to you.

2852
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,940
It's like people didn't
understand for years.

2853
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:15,350
I had to tell people that he's.

2854
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:16,580
He kind of grows on you.

2855
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:17,414
It's a weird thing.

2856
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:18,603
You know?

2857
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,630
It takes awhile for your
sense of humor to make sense,

2858
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:22,790
but even that you should
be embarrassed about.

2859
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:23,570
Yeah.

2860
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,390
Even you should be embarrassed
about that last one ever.

2861
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:25,740
I think.

2862
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:27,500
I just imagine it would be funny.

2863
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:28,641
I don't think so.

2864
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:29,474
I don't think it's funny though.

2865
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,033
A of card

2866
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:32,960
issues.

2867
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,530
Kid.

2868
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:34,131
You got issues.

2869
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:35,120
You're not even high right now.

2870
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:35,500
Yeah,

2871
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:35,900
I am.

2872
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,180
I've been smoking all the
whole time in the back.

2873
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:38,631
That's what you do.

2874
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:39,320
You leave.

2875
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:39,520
Well,

2876
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,260
you know I'm going to say make
it so you're not allowed to talk.

2877
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,460
If you get over a certain high,

2878
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:45,260
we need to get a
breathalyzer test for you.

2879
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,581
They should have that,

2880
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:47,030
right?

2881
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,850
They don't have that,

2882
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:48,683
but watch out.

2883
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,510
They don't have weed breathalyzers today.

2884
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:53,300
Like how much you've smoked,

2885
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:54,790
like how fucked up you are?

2886
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,320
Not.

2887
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:55,940
Well,

2888
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:57,320
I don't think it's relative.

2889
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:57,830
You know,

2890
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:58,160
it's,

2891
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:03,160
it's so hard to figure out like what is
for you mean it's the same blood level,

2892
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:04,210
right?

2893
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,750
It's just your tolerance.

2894
01:28:05,751 --> 01:28:07,940
Your tolerance doesn't
decrease it in your body.

2895
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:12,350
So it's like you could have a little
bit of pot in the person who's a fucking

2896
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:14,660
rookie and they are going to be blasted,

2897
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:17,080
but if you carry that
same amount of pot new,

2898
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:17,931
you'll be fun.

2899
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:20,180
So is there a thc levels or something?

2900
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:20,480
Right.

2901
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,440
But I'm saying thc is something that
your body gets comfortable with.

2902
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:25,950
It could be alcohol too.

2903
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:29,090
This is why there should be an
objective measurement of impairment.

2904
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:30,680
None out with alcohol.

2905
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:31,420
There's a,

2906
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:34,500
it should be a body fat mike thing
like where they do not be that.

2907
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,020
It should be an impairment thing,

2908
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,160
you know,

2909
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,240
I want it to be body fat.

2910
01:28:38,241 --> 01:28:39,110
Come on,

2911
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,880
I got pulled over once and I wasn't drunk.

2912
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:43,700
They thought I was and who was not.

2913
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:47,270
I just dropped my cell phone in between
my legs and I reached in and I changed

2914
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:48,104
lanes for a second,

2915
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:51,050
but it was nobody near
me but a cop behind me.

2916
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,771
So,

2917
01:28:51,771 --> 01:28:52,604
uh,

2918
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:54,110
I did all their shit.

2919
01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:54,500
Man.

2920
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,020
I have good balance man.

2921
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:56,691
I got no problem.

2922
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:57,381
I did all their shit.

2923
01:28:57,381 --> 01:28:57,971
Touch my note.

2924
01:28:57,971 --> 01:28:58,401
I'm like,

2925
01:28:58,401 --> 01:28:59,750
I'm not drunk at all,

2926
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:00,950
like I just want you to know.

2927
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,010
So I did all that shit and

2928
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,210
then they asked me to do a
breathalyzer test and um,

2929
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:07,620
I was like,

2930
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:08,280
really?

2931
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,270
Do I really have to do that?

2932
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:09,511
You know,

2933
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,830
I'm not drunk like this is silly.

2934
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:12,110
LiKe I could do that with.

2935
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:13,200
And then they sat,

2936
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,490
they got together and they huddled in
the nygaard we're going to let you go.

2937
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,000
Thank you.

2938
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:17,530
Thank you.

2939
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:18,660
Because I really wasn't drunk.

2940
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:19,381
I told the truth,

2941
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:20,280
I drop my shit,

2942
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,760
but there was that weird
moment where I was like,

2943
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,440
I wasn't guilty.

2944
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:27,360
Are you going to fuck
me just because you can?

2945
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:27,721
Yeah.

2946
01:29:27,721 --> 01:29:28,291
But I was like,

2947
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:30,870
is this going to be some weird thing
where I'm gonna wind up handcuffed in the

2948
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:31,441
back of a car?

2949
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:32,400
Because I'm making sense,

2950
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:33,091
you know,

2951
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:33,990
I just did all your shit.

2952
01:29:33,991 --> 01:29:35,010
I just touched my nose.

2953
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,071
I'm perfect.

2954
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:37,200
I got good balance.

2955
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:38,070
Everything's,

2956
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,090
there's no fuck ups.

2957
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,400
I'm following your pan fucking sober,

2958
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:42,303
right?

2959
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:45,420
I mean I think I might've had
one beer like three hours ago.

2960
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,950
It was like ridiculously sober,

2961
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,540
but it was a weird thing.

2962
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:48,811
Were like,

2963
01:29:48,811 --> 01:29:49,320
whoa,

2964
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,430
what if I blow pop?

2965
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:50,700
I mean,

2966
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:51,180
what is,

2967
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:51,961
what is legal?

2968
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:53,130
I don't know what the fuck legal is.

2969
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:53,600
Is it

2970
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,570
one beer an hour or something like that?

2971
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:56,340
You say that,

2972
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:56,911
but I don't know.

2973
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:58,350
I don't know what that is.

2974
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,570
Like when if you had a beer an hour ago,

2975
01:30:00,571 --> 01:30:01,770
you are noT fucking drunk.

2976
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:02,870
Will you test drunk?

2977
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:03,090
No,

2978
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:03,270
no,

2979
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:05,580
it's that you can oxidize
one drink per hour.

2980
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:06,390
So if you're one,

2981
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:10,740
if you drink the effect of that
serving of alcohol is gone an hour.

2982
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:11,820
If you have three drinks,

2983
01:30:11,821 --> 01:30:13,320
it's three hours for it to be gone.

2984
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:16,530
Is that three hours that
you can be tested for,

2985
01:30:16,531 --> 01:30:18,450
or three hours that you're impaired by?

2986
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:18,871
I don't know.

2987
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:19,740
I don't drink anymore.

2988
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:20,430
You don't drink at all?

2989
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:21,000
No.

2990
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,530
I mean,

2991
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:22,950
occasionally I'll have a glass of wine,

2992
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:23,221
but no,

2993
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:25,470
I quit drinking the cops
that I ran into a cool,

2994
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:27,260
but they didn't have to be,

2995
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:27,920
you know,

2996
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,650
it could have been,

2997
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:31,220
could have been coming off with some
terrible people and I'm always very polite

2998
01:30:31,221 --> 01:30:32,054
if anything happens,

2999
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:33,740
but uh,

3000
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,670
it's a weird feeling like you could
just lock me up right now when you,

3001
01:30:37,671 --> 01:30:41,660
when you watch like the videos of those
guys slamming you on the ground and

3002
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,800
arresting everybody for hugging you,

3003
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,910
you just want to go in and
you just want to rest them.

3004
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,040
You want to just pull them out
of society when it makes them,

3005
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:49,491
make them,

3006
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:50,010
watch this,

3007
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:52,010
make them sit in the theater with people,

3008
01:30:52,011 --> 01:30:54,470
sit on the stage and I want
you to sit in behind you.

3009
01:30:54,471 --> 01:30:55,520
We're going to play that video.

3010
01:30:55,521 --> 01:30:57,410
And then I want you to
respond to all these people,

3011
01:30:57,411 --> 01:30:58,041
the citizens,

3012
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:58,874
the tax payers.

3013
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,410
They're going to have
some questions for you.

3014
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,710
they don't even have any vested interest
and they have no emotional connection

3015
01:31:03,711 --> 01:31:04,544
to you or,

3016
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:05,450
or adam.

3017
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:06,081
And guess what?

3018
01:31:06,081 --> 01:31:06,620
Fuck face.

3019
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:09,890
That's going to be a real uncomfortable
feeling and people need to understand

3020
01:31:09,891 --> 01:31:10,131
that,

3021
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:13,280
that that's what this whole thing called
internet video and that's called the

3022
01:31:13,281 --> 01:31:14,114
free market.

3023
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:14,510
yeah,

3024
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:15,141
absolutely.

3025
01:31:15,141 --> 01:31:15,351
Yeah.

3026
01:31:15,351 --> 01:31:16,090
It's basically the same

3027
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:17,320
and the government is
out in front of that.

3028
01:31:17,321 --> 01:31:19,180
When you say government is
going to run public safety,

3029
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:20,110
that's what you get.

3030
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:20,770
Yeah.

3031
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:21,011
Well,

3032
01:31:21,011 --> 01:31:22,000
it doesn't have to be that way.

3033
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,720
You know?

3034
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,440
First it will be much more of it.

3035
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:25,283
I always say,

3036
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,350
so you're on board.

3037
01:31:26,351 --> 01:31:29,020
I can sign you up for
a tour with revolution,

3038
01:31:29,021 --> 01:31:31,090
but this podcast and I like to play pool.

3039
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,410
Very busy doing comedy in the revolution.

3040
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:37,090
If I'm amanda know you absolutely know
what you absolutely are to be fair

3041
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:37,870
because you are,

3042
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:41,530
you are spreading important information
and you are sharing a very important

3043
01:31:41,531 --> 01:31:43,540
perspective that is about
challenging authority,

3044
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,130
but you know there are lots
about challenging yourself.

3045
01:31:46,131 --> 01:31:46,750
Next level.

3046
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,340
It's challenging yourself as well.

3047
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:51,790
You know what I've always said is that
what's going to change this world is the

3048
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:52,600
youth,

3049
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,130
the people that are growing up right now,

3050
01:31:54,131 --> 01:31:56,590
the people that are listening to this
in their dorm rooms and people that are

3051
01:31:56,591 --> 01:32:00,100
listening to this and that are high school
bedroom where trying to keep it down

3052
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,530
because her dad would yell at them because
he disagrees with all the shit we're

3053
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:03,364
talking about.

3054
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:08,200
Those Are the people that are going to
be involved and exposed to information

3055
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:10,870
that our generation and
the previous generations,

3056
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:12,520
that rumsfeld's of the world,

3057
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,980
they never thought that this
was going to be an option.

3058
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:18,880
They never thought that information
would be so freely distributed between

3059
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:19,990
anyone everywhere,

3060
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:20,824
all over the world.

3061
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,180
That was never in the plan.

3062
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,160
They thought they're going
to be able to run shit.

3063
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:25,090
Business as usual.

3064
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:28,690
So what we're seeing now
with world dominanCe and the
craziness and the chaos of

3065
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:29,524
foreign policy,

3066
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,980
we're seeing like the
the last ripples of this,

3067
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,170
this emerging creature,

3068
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:39,490
this emerging new human technology,

3069
01:32:39,491 --> 01:32:40,324
symbiotic.

3070
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:43,570
So right now it's pushing
all the old things out.

3071
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:48,100
It's pushing all the old paradigms away
and it's going to dissolve standard

3072
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:52,510
forms of government and law enforcement
to dissolve all that shit because you're

3073
01:32:52,511 --> 01:32:54,460
going to be a part of everybody.

3074
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,450
It's going to happen.

3075
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,250
That's where it's going.

3076
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,590
It's going to be technological
or it'll be the next stage of,

3077
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,400
of our physical evolution if you you know,

3078
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:05,920
if you're allowed to use that term
when it comes to something that's

3079
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:06,970
technologically driven,

3080
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:07,870
because I think it may be.

3081
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:08,061
I mean,

3082
01:33:08,061 --> 01:33:11,440
I think it may be something that someone
creates and they create an ability to

3083
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:15,460
enhance the human body and if you look
at what they're doing now with genetic

3084
01:33:15,461 --> 01:33:18,580
engineering and they're creating
fucking bladders and petri dishes,

3085
01:33:18,581 --> 01:33:18,910
they're.

3086
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:21,090
They're working on developing
artificial organs there.

3087
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:21,910
The workup.

3088
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:23,510
Eventually they're going to look at the.

3089
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,710
Once they figure out more and more
and more about the human body,

3090
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,810
they're going to figure out
parts of it and got to go.

3091
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,370
We're gonna fix everything.

3092
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,140
We're just going to turn this into.

3093
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:34,480
We're just going to remove all the greed.

3094
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:37,570
There's no more greed and we're
going to install community.

3095
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:39,280
This is the newest formula.

3096
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:41,240
We've developed a new brain simpler

3097
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:41,660
than that.

3098
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:44,570
it's simpler than that
therapy man therapy.

3099
01:33:44,571 --> 01:33:46,520
Everybody just gets therapy
and government goes away.

3100
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:50,030
What do you think that therapy iS
good enough to work on everybody?

3101
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:50,601
Well,

3102
01:33:50,601 --> 01:33:53,840
eventually as we have greater
prosperity in general,

3103
01:33:53,841 --> 01:33:56,060
we have more leisure time
to address these issues.

3104
01:33:56,061 --> 01:33:59,720
We have more time that we're not spending
scrambling to maintain our quality of

3105
01:33:59,721 --> 01:33:59,931
life.

3106
01:33:59,931 --> 01:34:00,260
Yeah,

3107
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,690
I think that's one of one of the next
phases we're going to be coming to.

3108
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:02,931
Well,

3109
01:34:02,931 --> 01:34:04,100
if we got an issue,

3110
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,010
you have to start with the
poorest part of the country.

3111
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:07,401
Right?

3112
01:34:07,401 --> 01:34:08,180
If you have,

3113
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,920
if you're allowed to
use your resources here,

3114
01:34:09,921 --> 01:34:13,100
only because otherwise we should start
at the poorest part of the world.

3115
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:13,661
You know,

3116
01:34:13,661 --> 01:34:17,030
that's what you really should be trying
to balance this whole motherfucker out.

3117
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,430
I mean,

3118
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:20,210
that should be the ultimate goal because
it could have been no real peace.

3119
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:20,421
Well,

3120
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:25,070
the answer is some sort of every human
being equitably into the market so then

3121
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:27,080
means anybody can move to America.

3122
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:27,980
Yeah,

3123
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,940
that's a problem.

3124
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,670
No,

3125
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:29,950
it's.

3126
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:32,240
The highway is so fucking
crowded right now.

3127
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:32,781
Do you know?

3128
01:34:32,781 --> 01:34:33,261
Crazy,

3129
01:34:33,261 --> 01:34:35,720
it would be if indians could just
come here on their own free will.

3130
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,040
There's a billion of them.

3131
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,100
You ready to apply austrian economics in
a way that's going to bake your noodle

3132
01:34:40,101 --> 01:34:44,080
just a little bit when you talk about
roads and the government monopoly and

3133
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:44,840
subsidization,

3134
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,690
subsidization of the auto industry
and the oil and gas industry.

3135
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:50,620
If we didn't have the
government doing that,

3136
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,600
eisenhower who built the interstate
highway system to serve the needs of the

3137
01:34:53,601 --> 01:34:56,750
military and like where I live in New
Mexico or where I'm from in New Mexico

3138
01:34:56,751 --> 01:34:57,770
where the

3139
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,850
speaker of the state house can have an
intersection move to where he wants it to

3140
01:35:01,851 --> 01:35:05,450
make his land worth more and we didn't
have all that methane being forced into

3141
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:06,284
that.

3142
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:07,011
We would.

3143
01:35:07,011 --> 01:35:07,750
We would be.

3144
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:11,570
You were already at the point where we
should have cars that are self driving,

3145
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,540
but if it wasn't for government keeping
all this research and development

3146
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:15,890
stifled with intellectual property,

3147
01:35:15,891 --> 01:35:16,190
you know,

3148
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:17,210
who killed the electric car?

3149
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,110
Have you seen that documentary?

3150
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,810
You can imagine how much you see.

3151
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:24,640
There's just that one government policy
of intellectual property of so that oh,

3152
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,650
you invented a battery and you bought
a piece of paper that describes it from

3153
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:29,750
someone you can keep that from humanity.

3154
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:30,340
Do you know?

3155
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:30,560
I mean,

3156
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,940
do you see how much that holds us back?

3157
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:35,750
You see how much the
exploitation by government
keeps us from evolving into that

3158
01:35:35,751 --> 01:35:36,740
state of greater technology.

3159
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,330
I mean even even like,

3160
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:41,630
why do we not have self
driving cars right now?

3161
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:46,520
Because why do we not have
twenties of the technological era?

3162
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:47,370
This is the last,

3163
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:49,280
but it's still holding us back.

3164
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:49,550
No,

3165
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,310
it's still going.

3166
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:51,270
It's still holding us know,

3167
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,580
incredible romantic.

3168
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:56,420
To be able to hear the rumble of a v
eight step on the gas when you want to

3169
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:58,820
instead of just being
trapped in a fucking grid,

3170
01:35:58,821 --> 01:36:00,260
like your own little trolley car.

3171
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:02,060
Maybe you want to have a little passion.

3172
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:02,350
Man.

3173
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:03,860
I fucking car.

3174
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:07,550
I can't fucking believe there are so
many god damn liberal status here in

3175
01:36:07,551 --> 01:36:11,780
southern California when all around them
they are wasting hours and hours and

3176
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:12,614
hours of their day.

3177
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,090
Well,

3178
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:13,400
I get.

3179
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,440
I guess it's because they sit there
and they listened to propaganda,

3180
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:19,580
npr and their communities in their
cars and they don't do about it.

3181
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,130
Geez.

3182
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:24,800
maybe having the government
managed transportation
resources isn't a good idea.

3183
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:25,281
Well,

3184
01:36:25,281 --> 01:36:26,360
I don't think that's
what they're thinking.

3185
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:26,691
They're thinking,

3186
01:36:26,691 --> 01:36:27,890
how the fuck did I get to work?

3187
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,071
Well,

3188
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:30,530
it's because their propaganda is the
whole time they're in the car to begin

3189
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:30,760
with.

3190
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,280
Well,

3191
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,260
I don't know if that's
necessarily what their problem is.

3192
01:36:33,261 --> 01:36:34,520
Their problem is they have to work.

3193
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:37,580
The problem is that they have to have
a job and if you have to be in fucking

3194
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:39,140
santa monica at 9:00 in the morning,

3195
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:40,180
there's only one way to do it.

3196
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:42,440
Another way of looking
at what we're doing,

3197
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:42,740
you know,

3198
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:45,370
but that's not necessarily designed
by the government to keep you stupid.

3199
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:47,720
That's just we have the resource.

3200
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:48,650
We have too many god damn.

3201
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:50,630
People know this is a side
effect of government though.

3202
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:54,060
What's a side effect of them being
incompetent race and that you have the,

3203
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:57,080
the through the system of
concentrations of wealth and power,

3204
01:36:57,081 --> 01:37:00,850
you have unnatural incentives to live
in concentrated population areas and if

3205
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:03,500
anything la is still
relatively spread out.

3206
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:07,130
I mean compared to
certain cities or in asia,

3207
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,240
I think they said vancouver is the
most densely populated city in the,

3208
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:12,170
in this continent,

3209
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,850
which I thought was really fascinating.

3210
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,740
I would've never thought
that it was that crowded,

3211
01:37:15,741 --> 01:37:19,400
but I guess it's smaller and
it's got a high population,

3212
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,360
but like there's areas of vancouver that
are most densely I would've thought in

3213
01:37:22,361 --> 01:37:25,580
New York for sure when you have thought
that it was New York would be more

3214
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:26,370
densely populated.

3215
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:27,710
Central park In the middle still.

3216
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:28,640
Yeah,

3217
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,473
that's true.

3218
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:30,890
Yeah.

3219
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:32,510
It's a great place though.

3220
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:33,140
I mean,

3221
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:33,973
fascinating place.

3222
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:35,740
It's certainly a hive of,

3223
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:37,190
of instant energy.

3224
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:38,720
I never want to live there,

3225
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,430
but it is a fun place to vIsit.

3226
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,270
I agree with you.

3227
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:42,500
I've thought about spending time there.

3228
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:45,500
I've thought about like maybe living
there for like a couple months just for a

3229
01:37:45,501 --> 01:37:46,660
goof just to see what it was.

3230
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:51,230
I think it's good to mix a mix your brain
up and I almost moved there to bergen

3231
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:54,060
girlfriend told you need to.

3232
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,320
You need a friend.

3233
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:55,840
Hey joe.

3234
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,010
He's

3235
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,320
someone who's going to talk to you
when it comes to shit like this.

3236
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,670
Can't get too crazy son.

3237
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:00,980
I have an awesome app.

3238
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,450
I have an awesome new app
that's going to blow your mind.

3239
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:03,711
It's gonna.

3240
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:05,250
Make it kind of freak out a little.

3241
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:05,840
But what does that.

3242
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,360
It's a program called crime map and
you could download on your iphone.

3243
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:13,560
I'm not sure if android or not and it
uses gps to tell you where you're out on

3244
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:13,670
that,

3245
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:13,890
you know,

3246
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:14,723
uses the map,

3247
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:17,930
but that tells you all the
crimes around that that had,

3248
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:21,090
has happened within the one day.

3249
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,800
Like they're just where I live.

3250
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,140
There's like burger lee.

3251
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:24,540
There's,

3252
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,030
there's been like assaults.

3253
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:26,671
There's been,

3254
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:27,000
you know,

3255
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,080
home invasions.

3256
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:28,914
There's like in it,

3257
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,660
it will freak you the fuck.

3258
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:31,920
It was all just andy dick,

3259
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:33,410
but like,

3260
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:33,930
look at it.

3261
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:34,260
Here's,

3262
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:37,950
here's an example of where we're at right
now at the ice house and you can see

3263
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:40,590
that there's been car
accIdents and crimes.

3264
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:41,910
There's been one mugging,

3265
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,350
it looks like a.

3266
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:45,690
And it will show it if you just zoom out,

3267
01:38:45,691 --> 01:38:45,840
like,

3268
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,170
just like,

3269
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:46,741
look at this.

3270
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:47,880
This is going to freak you out though,

3271
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:50,970
like just for a pasadena,

3272
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:51,600
uh,

3273
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,440
yesterday.

3274
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,250
Just like,

3275
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,900
look how much fucking crying

3276
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:57,570
in my car.

3277
01:38:57,571 --> 01:38:58,590
Accidents and,

3278
01:38:58,620 --> 01:38:59,453
and shit like that.

3279
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,630
It will.

3280
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:02,760
And it's cool to do it at your house
though because then you're like,

3281
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:03,630
what the fuck happened?

3282
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:04,240
See,

3283
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,660
I think something like this goes back to
this problem that I have with the human

3284
01:39:07,661 --> 01:39:10,150
body in this technological society.

3285
01:39:10,151 --> 01:39:13,360
It's not capable of
keeping up with everything.

3286
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:16,600
There's too much shit coming at you and
it's too much shit coming at you that

3287
01:39:16,601 --> 01:39:17,890
you really don't need to know about.

3288
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:18,610
I mean,

3289
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:22,420
maybe you should know that there'd
been a 150 different car accidents in

3290
01:39:22,421 --> 01:39:23,254
pasedena,

3291
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:25,180
but that is going to
fuck with your head man.

3292
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:25,601
You know,

3293
01:39:25,601 --> 01:39:25,810
when,

3294
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:27,300
when there's such a thing as rational.

3295
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:27,700
Again,

3296
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:30,970
you should be dealing with your
life and your reality right now,

3297
01:39:30,971 --> 01:39:35,050
but instead you're dealing with
realities hundreds of yards away,

3298
01:39:35,051 --> 01:39:35,980
a mile away,

3299
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:39,700
but all six miles away and all these
realities are interfering into your

3300
01:39:39,701 --> 01:39:40,180
reality,

3301
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:43,120
but also wouldn't you like to
know just for safety reasons,

3302
01:39:43,121 --> 01:39:44,260
like be able to check
your house and be like,

3303
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:44,681
holy shit,

3304
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:47,080
there's been seven home
invasions in the last two weeks.

3305
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,370
I need to up my shit here.

3306
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:48,760
Alright,

3307
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,391
get the most.

3308
01:39:49,391 --> 01:39:49,751
Certainly.

3309
01:39:49,751 --> 01:39:49,961
Yeah.

3310
01:39:49,961 --> 01:39:50,170
No,

3311
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:50,831
you got a good point.

3312
01:39:50,831 --> 01:39:51,521
No doubt about it.

3313
01:39:51,521 --> 01:39:54,550
All I'm saying is it's just weird
that we have this ancient brain,

3314
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:55,990
certainly a good quad.

3315
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,870
I certainly prefer to be able
to access information than not,

3316
01:39:59,040 --> 01:39:59,461
but it's.

3317
01:39:59,461 --> 01:40:04,461
It's a weird brain that we have where
we essentially have the same mind of

3318
01:40:04,481 --> 01:40:06,040
people that lived in the past.

3319
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:08,950
When you write things
down on animal skins,

3320
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:11,110
those dudes we find like their parchments,

3321
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:13,480
their brands are exactly the same as ours,

3322
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:16,930
but when they find like 2000 year
old documents or thousand year old,

3323
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:17,800
holy shit,

3324
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:18,041
they.

3325
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:20,260
Their brains were exactly like ours.

3326
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:22,830
But think of how much more shit is in our,

3327
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:23,810
but we're also not

3328
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:24,451
remember.

3329
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:29,330
We don't know how to fucking skin a
fucking go and use the skin as a brawl or.

3330
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,173
THat's true too.

3331
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:32,850
So it took stuff away that
we don't have to use it.

3332
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:33,171
Yeah,

3333
01:40:33,171 --> 01:40:33,651
but no,

3334
01:40:33,651 --> 01:40:34,730
the access to information,

3335
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:36,160
access to information,

3336
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:40,460
you're finding out about things that
are happening in Pakistan and Syria and

3337
01:40:40,461 --> 01:40:45,461
Japan is a nuclear problem and what's
going on in Russia and chechen and the

3338
01:40:46,131 --> 01:40:49,670
Philippines and there's an earthquake
and Thailand and this shit is coming at

3339
01:40:49,671 --> 01:40:52,370
you all day every day.

3340
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:53,710
If you get twitter,

3341
01:40:53,711 --> 01:40:55,300
if you get on cnn.com,

3342
01:40:55,301 --> 01:40:56,880
if you go and access the new sites,

3343
01:40:57,140 --> 01:41:01,210
you are constantly inundated by actions
and things that are happening that

3344
01:41:01,211 --> 01:41:02,860
literally have nothing to do with you,

3345
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:07,360
but it's a constant barrage
of them because you were
in contact with essentially

3346
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:11,590
billions of people and all the information
that they project out there and to

3347
01:41:11,591 --> 01:41:16,591
the internet and it's our little shitty
brains are not meant to have that much

3348
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,040
information coming at us.

3349
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:23,160
We still hAve this tribal body that
wants to move around and find animals and

3350
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:28,830
grow vegetables and this is the same
fucking body and this body is getting

3351
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:33,930
youtube videos and fucking all kinds of
crazy information coming out at all day,

3352
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:35,500
24 hours a day.

3353
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:40,120
It's almost like we're standing in the
middle of a river and we just trying to

3354
01:41:40,121 --> 01:41:41,080
hold out of the water.

3355
01:41:41,081 --> 01:41:42,250
It's almost like it's too much.

3356
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:46,540
It's almost like for every one person
there's way too much information that you

3357
01:41:46,541 --> 01:41:48,220
have to absorb about everything.

3358
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:51,280
It's like to even focus on one thing.

3359
01:41:51,281 --> 01:41:54,760
It's like you could give
your whole life to politics.

3360
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:58,840
You have your whole life to observing
politics and still barely have a grasp on

3361
01:41:58,841 --> 01:42:00,040
everything that's going on.

3362
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:03,730
All the sneaky little fucking underhanded
deals that are taking place all over

3363
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:04,120
the place.

3364
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:05,560
How could you possibly manage them?

3365
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:07,450
How could you possibly
even researched them?

3366
01:42:07,451 --> 01:42:11,440
How can you possibly even read all the
documents that have been transcribed,

3367
01:42:11,441 --> 01:42:12,400
but every different case?

3368
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:13,460
You can't do it.

3369
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:16,120
It's insanity to people passing the laws.

3370
01:42:16,121 --> 01:42:16,954
don't even read them.

3371
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:17,830
Let's wait.

3372
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:20,800
While and I was talking about before
about we're all apart of something,

3373
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:21,940
we all have our,

3374
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:26,620
a part of this weird fucking
machine of humanity and some people,

3375
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:29,140
their part is to figure out how
to make an alienware computer.

3376
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:32,950
Your part is to rile people up on the
internet and I don't know what the fuck my

3377
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:33,784
part is,

3378
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:35,650
but everybody has a piece that,

3379
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:36,533
dude,

3380
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,160
we're making cars.

3381
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:39,100
They have art.

3382
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:39,570
Are

3383
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,950
you get people passIonate because you
are passionate because you care and you,

3384
01:42:41,951 --> 01:42:42,211
you,

3385
01:42:42,211 --> 01:42:43,200
you understand what the silver.

3386
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:46,260
Let me go back to what brian said
because he said something really profound

3387
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:48,130
about possible.

3388
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:50,570
You just woke up the dry.

3389
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,400
We'll go up the drag.

3390
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:53,220
No,

3391
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:57,450
because what you said about every
development like taking away a part of,

3392
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:59,250
of what it is to be human being.

3393
01:42:59,251 --> 01:42:59,521
Right,

3394
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:03,690
and I remember just well what it used to
be to be a human being like hunting and

3395
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,720
trapping and fishing
and living off the land.

3396
01:43:06,721 --> 01:43:07,770
Growing your own vegetables,

3397
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:09,390
knowing what to eat when you're sick.

3398
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:10,141
Yeah,

3399
01:43:10,141 --> 01:43:10,890
I mean that's,

3400
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:11,723
by the way,

3401
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,010
it's almost impossible to do that now.

3402
01:43:14,011 --> 01:43:15,540
Try try to fucking living off the land.

3403
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:20,570
Good luck is that some way evolutionary
and you can't hold a job and live off

3404
01:43:22,651 --> 01:43:23,490
the land the same time,

3405
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:28,610
but I can explain this actually
through my last dmt experience.

3406
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:29,903
Oh,

3407
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:30,953
I know.

3408
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,310
Which is really interesting because I.

3409
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:36,660
I've been posting my dmt experiences on
my youtube channel and I've good way to

3410
01:43:36,661 --> 01:43:37,370
get arrested.

3411
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:41,520
I've had three sessions of interested
enough times that they're not going to

3412
01:43:41,521 --> 01:43:42,390
come after me for that.

3413
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,190
I've had.

3414
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:49,190
I've had three sessions and every time
I've smoked twice and this last time has

3415
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:51,360
been exponentially more complex.

3416
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:52,220
The first

3417
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:57,140
time started with a blob
of psychedelic colors.

3418
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:02,480
The second time it had a bit of a female
personality and a bit of a form to it,

3419
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:03,770
but not much more.

3420
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:09,340
The third time I saw building structures
and scenery type stuff and the fourth

3421
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:15,821
time I saw what I described as my
face being raped with the truth of the

3422
01:44:15,831 --> 01:44:20,210
universe and it was this complex
vision and the last time,

3423
01:44:20,211 --> 01:44:25,211
the third time in the first launch I saw
a pattern of like colored bricks moving

3424
01:44:27,621 --> 01:44:27,981
at me,

3425
01:44:27,981 --> 01:44:31,210
unfolding in different ways and going
through different color shifts and showing

3426
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:31,701
different shapes.

3427
01:44:31,701 --> 01:44:32,810
And it was like,

3428
01:44:32,811 --> 01:44:33,081
wow,

3429
01:44:33,081 --> 01:44:35,570
now it's really complex and
trying to show me something.

3430
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,430
And then I did another rip.

3431
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:37,701
Right.

3432
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:41,080
Then as soon as I came out of that one
and I spent half the time laughing.

3433
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:42,890
It was just a beautiful experience,

3434
01:44:42,891 --> 01:44:45,800
but I couldn't even describe the
whole thing and I was videotaping it.

3435
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,340
So I tried afterwards to talk to the
camera and describe everything I did and

3436
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:54,050
this one we actually as we speak and
versus the dmt part two and two point one

3437
01:44:54,051 --> 01:44:56,450
or uploading with disclaimers on them.

3438
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:57,930
And then part three is,

3439
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,440
is in the can and I'm going
to be editing and it soon.

3440
01:45:00,441 --> 01:45:01,220
But that,

3441
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:05,570
that second trip and the third
time was just overwhelming.

3442
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:09,860
I couldn't even describe it and it was
so much coming at me and and and in

3443
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:11,990
different forms and in different
colors and different shapes,

3444
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:14,420
but what I experienced
in the middle of that,

3445
01:45:14,421 --> 01:45:19,421
that was the just had me laughing with
joy the entire time was inexperience of

3446
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:24,911
the pure human will and at first it was
like a vision of a brain floating in a

3447
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:28,250
psychedelic space,

3448
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:28,880
whatever.

3449
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,150
I don't even know how to
describe it and I'm sure you.

3450
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:33,350
You know what I'm talking about though,

3451
01:45:33,351 --> 01:45:37,490
where you're in that space
space listening this experience,

3452
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:38,800
and then I.

3453
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:42,820
Then it wasn't the brain and then
it was my consciousness and you.

3454
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:47,270
You realize that your consciousness is
separate from your brain and that it's

3455
01:45:47,271 --> 01:45:48,830
still a product of your biology,

3456
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:53,180
but that there was something in the middle
of it that is the human will that is

3457
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:54,014
distinct.

3458
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:56,420
That is who we are.

3459
01:45:56,421 --> 01:45:57,470
Because if you think about it,

3460
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:58,550
we're not.

3461
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:59,870
PartIcles were waves.

3462
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:04,550
You know what defines us is not our matter
that is recycled every seven years or

3463
01:46:04,551 --> 01:46:06,860
whatever it is that all your
cells are replaced in your body.

3464
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,360
You are a wave of energy.

3465
01:46:08,361 --> 01:46:10,340
Everything that gives you
identity as a human being,

3466
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:14,240
as as an entity is a wave and and what
I experienced and what do you mean by a

3467
01:46:14,241 --> 01:46:15,074
wave?

3468
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:15,891
Well,

3469
01:46:15,891 --> 01:46:16,760
what gives you form?

3470
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,151
It's not.

3471
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:17,961
It's not your body,

3472
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:19,340
it's not the material of your body.

3473
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:20,630
it's the course of your life,

3474
01:46:20,650 --> 01:46:22,400
the the person that you were as a baby,

3475
01:46:22,401 --> 01:46:26,440
the body that you were seven years later
did not have a single molecule in it

3476
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:29,160
that was in it when you were
born and every seven years your,

3477
01:46:29,161 --> 01:46:32,610
your entire body is replaced
and all matter can be analyzed.

3478
01:46:32,611 --> 01:46:33,380
Your neurons,

3479
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:33,711
right?

3480
01:46:33,711 --> 01:46:34,544
Well,

3481
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:36,010
we even then they're there.

3482
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,540
The molecules are cycled out.

3483
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:39,950
It doesn't matter.

3484
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:40,933
I'm not a physicist.

3485
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:42,470
I don't care about the details of that.

3486
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:44,130
Thinking about life.

3487
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,270
That's why neurodegenerative the cell.

3488
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,300
So the cell structures,

3489
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:48,770
you do absolutely heal from them,

3490
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:49,980
but all of the matter

3491
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,270
is,

3492
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:52,200
is recycled.

3493
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,680
Although if you go down to the son,

3494
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:57,360
the son molecular level,

3495
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:57,871
you know,

3496
01:46:57,871 --> 01:47:00,150
everything can be analyzed as a
particle or a wave and anything.

3497
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:02,850
I just was trying to figure
out like if you know how to,

3498
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:03,893
what's the,

3499
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:04,490
you know,

3500
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:07,410
w w what's the best way for someone
to try to wrap their head around?

3501
01:47:07,411 --> 01:47:07,590
What,

3502
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:08,430
what you mean by that?

3503
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:09,170
Because when I,

3504
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:10,620
I kind of don't understand
what you're saying,

3505
01:47:10,621 --> 01:47:11,670
but when you say you're not a particle,

3506
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,513
your wave,

3507
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:14,700
what exactly do you mean by that?

3508
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:14,911
Well,

3509
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:15,744
what are you,

3510
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:17,310
what defines you?

3511
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:18,280
What devices?

3512
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:19,620
And this isn't a question of physics,

3513
01:47:19,621 --> 01:47:20,760
this is a question of philosophy.

3514
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:21,750
What defInes you,

3515
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:22,231
joe rogan,

3516
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:23,064
who are you?

3517
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:25,840
I'm just this dude that gets
to say what joe rogan does.

3518
01:47:25,841 --> 01:47:27,360
So what are you the matter in your body?

3519
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:28,111
Um,

3520
01:47:28,111 --> 01:47:29,520
I'm certainly in my consciousness,

3521
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,413
my choices.

3522
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,220
So are you the thoughts in your brain?

3523
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:37,520
I would imagine that you are wherever
the thoughts resonate from whether or not

3524
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:42,480
it really is in your brain or whether
it's in every aspect of your body.

3525
01:47:42,481 --> 01:47:43,920
It's just your Brain projects it,

3526
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,650
whether or not it's even the brain that
projection with him to the brain tunes

3527
01:47:46,651 --> 01:47:47,070
it in,

3528
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:49,140
whether it's like a frequency and use.

3529
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,820
Use this body as a vehicle.

3530
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:53,310
There's people that
believe that I don't know,

3531
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:56,230
but that's what I experienced
what I experienced in my last dmt.

3532
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,450
But you were high as fuck.

3533
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:58,000
That's right.

3534
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,260
That's.

3535
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,540
You got to always remember
you were high as fuck.

3536
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:03,090
Whenever someone tells me like
they had a psychedelic experience,

3537
01:48:03,091 --> 01:48:03,361
I said,

3538
01:48:03,361 --> 01:48:03,511
look,

3539
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:04,344
I've had a lot of them.

3540
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,520
They've changed my life.

3541
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:06,331
They're beautiful.

3542
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:08,640
They're amazing with whatever
that comes out of it,

3543
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:12,090
but you always have to open the door to
the possibility that you were just high

3544
01:48:12,091 --> 01:48:15,210
as fuck and this is some shit that
you might've already known anyway,

3545
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:19,770
so I don't know whether or not you're
really communicating with somebody.

3546
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:20,760
When you do damn tay,

3547
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,550
it seems.

3548
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:21,701
Oh,

3549
01:48:21,701 --> 01:48:22,200
I don't believe.

3550
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:22,351
No.

3551
01:48:22,351 --> 01:48:23,460
I don't believe in any of that shit.

3552
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:25,590
I don't know my baby man.

3553
01:48:25,591 --> 01:48:26,600
It might be lifeforms.

3554
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:30,420
It does something to your brain and learn
something to yourself and things are

3555
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:33,180
exposed to your consciousness
that wouldn't be otherwise.

3556
01:48:33,181 --> 01:48:34,530
I think that's really important that,

3557
01:48:34,531 --> 01:48:37,390
but it also could be some sort of a
chemical doorway to another dementia.

3558
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,120
Communication by

3559
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:44,040
the evidence is that dimethyltryptamine
is something they believe your body

3560
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:47,040
produces when you're in periods of extreme
stress or when your body thinks it's

3561
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:50,070
going to die and if you
follow all the different

3562
01:48:51,570 --> 01:48:53,340
myths and different cultures,

3563
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,050
beliefs in the afterlife,

3564
01:48:55,410 --> 01:49:00,410
I mean so many of them involve going
towards the light and these crazy visions

3565
01:49:00,721 --> 01:49:04,590
and what those are probably or near
death experiences because your brain is

3566
01:49:04,591 --> 01:49:08,160
tripping out on dmp and
that's a much more rational,

3567
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:11,070
very well be real that we think of.

3568
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:14,110
We oNly think of ourselves as
real because we can make noise,

3569
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:14,910
can hit you.

3570
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:19,770
You can feel away from physics that
99 percent of this is empty space.

3571
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:20,461
Yeah,

3572
01:49:20,461 --> 01:49:20,880
we don't.

3573
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:21,390
Yeah,

3574
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:21,691
yeah.

3575
01:49:21,691 --> 01:49:23,670
Well that's certainly
a part of the problem.

3576
01:49:23,970 --> 01:49:26,760
We don't necessarily know what
the fuck is really going on here.

3577
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:28,163
You know,

3578
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:30,570
this thing really might be a simulation,

3579
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:33,390
but this is the science behind that.

3580
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:36,330
This is what I experienced and this is
what was profound about it to me was that

3581
01:49:36,331 --> 01:49:37,164
it was.

3582
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:39,960
I could only describe it
as pure human will and I,

3583
01:49:39,961 --> 01:49:40,181
and,

3584
01:49:40,181 --> 01:49:41,190
and I don't.

3585
01:49:41,191 --> 01:49:43,710
I don't want to say it was an out of
body experience because that describes it

3586
01:49:43,711 --> 01:49:43,951
wrong,

3587
01:49:43,951 --> 01:49:48,190
but it was an experience where my
consciousness was separated from the rest

3588
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,023
of my being.

3589
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:50,650
That was what you took out of it.

3590
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:53,500
You felt like that was what
the experience was for me.

3591
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:53,980
Right.

3592
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:56,500
And that was a very empowering experience.

3593
01:49:56,690 --> 01:49:57,610
to get back to what,

3594
01:49:57,611 --> 01:49:58,030
brian,

3595
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:58,863
when you say lou,

3596
01:49:58,930 --> 01:49:59,621
when you say like,

3597
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:00,341
by your being,

3598
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:01,540
do you mean by like your,

3599
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:02,374
your,

3600
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:04,510
your culture or your language?

3601
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:06,070
Like you were free of all that.

3602
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:06,851
He would just,

3603
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:06,911
uh,

3604
01:50:06,911 --> 01:50:07,540
being.

3605
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:08,230
Did you feel that?

3606
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:08,850
Yeah,

3607
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:09,180
yeah,

3608
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:09,500
yeah.

3609
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,910
You with no context,

3610
01:50:10,911 --> 01:50:11,131
right?

3611
01:50:11,131 --> 01:50:11,300
No.

3612
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:11,560
Comes,

3613
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,760
like a singularity,

3614
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:13,410
you know,

3615
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:14,111
and this is,

3616
01:50:14,111 --> 01:50:14,231
you know,

3617
01:50:14,231 --> 01:50:14,531
it's funny.

3618
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:18,850
This is how I think of the effect of
marijuana when I smoke weed usually,

3619
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,280
and it's the.

3620
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:22,360
If your consciousness is,

3621
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:23,500
and this is a crude metaphor,

3622
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:28,501
but a point moving around in your brain
point of light say than marijuana makes

3623
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:30,430
it a more diffuse light.

3624
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:32,500
And sometimes that means
exploring different things.

3625
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:37,500
And I think that explains the creative
legendary benefits of marijuana.

3626
01:50:37,551 --> 01:50:38,170
I agree,

3627
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:41,290
but it also means it's sometimes
harder to put sentences together.

3628
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:42,100
Yes.

3629
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:46,290
And sometimes it's hard to
really get the idea and,

3630
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:47,350
and hold it doWn.

3631
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:47,750
You know,

3632
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:50,950
it's like these new doors
present themselves and you
have to stop and look at it

3633
01:50:50,951 --> 01:50:51,784
all and go.

3634
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:52,810
But I'm inspired,

3635
01:50:52,811 --> 01:50:53,021
man.

3636
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:53,490
I'm like,

3637
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:53,831
this is,

3638
01:50:53,831 --> 01:50:57,190
this is a really exciting thing for
me to get to be on your podcast.

3639
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:57,620
Well,

3640
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:59,350
I'm inspired to have you on man.

3641
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:01,150
It's cool to hear that you enjoy the show.

3642
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:02,520
So anyway,

3643
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,090
so to what brian was saying though,

3644
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:06,490
to what brian was saying about brian,

3645
01:51:06,491 --> 01:51:07,324
what were you saying?

3646
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,810
Um,

3647
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:11,800
something about fucking a Jack
Daniels bottle or something.

3648
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:12,191
Yeah,

3649
01:51:12,191 --> 01:51:12,791
that's what it was.

3650
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:13,510
But no,

3651
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:18,340
It was about people forget how to kill
goats and shit and make bikinis out of

3652
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:18,440
them,

3653
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:20,200
but I don't think they ever really did.

3654
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:23,890
Historically we can see the
technological singularity coming,

3655
01:51:23,891 --> 01:51:24,161
right?

3656
01:51:24,161 --> 01:51:26,920
We see that coming and we can
see if we don't fuck it up.

3657
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:27,100
Right.

3658
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:30,040
And see sooner or later we're going to
have taco copters and food's going to

3659
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:34,030
drop out of the sky for us on our cars
will drive themselves or whatever the

3660
01:51:34,031 --> 01:51:34,864
case is going to be.

3661
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,310
But I think that there's
someone else coming,

3662
01:51:36,311 --> 01:51:36,521
you know,

3663
01:51:36,521 --> 01:51:37,600
when every surface in the,

3664
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,430
around us as a touch screen and,

3665
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:39,750
and,

3666
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:43,240
and we just get to that level of
prosperity and that's coming within our

3667
01:51:43,241 --> 01:51:45,760
lifetimes because it's
happening so exponentially.

3668
01:51:45,761 --> 01:51:46,690
I see this as,

3669
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:47,560
you know,

3670
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,940
who knows how long it's gonna take,

3671
01:51:48,941 --> 01:51:49,751
but again,

3672
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:52,880
an urgency for me to help
humanity evolve past status,

3673
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:53,410
um,

3674
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:53,850
but will,

3675
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:58,510
we're coming to is a state of greater
experience in our day to day lives of that

3676
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:00,760
pure human will that
we're evolving to that.

3677
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:01,031
And you know,

3678
01:52:01,031 --> 01:52:01,721
I know this is silly,

3679
01:52:01,721 --> 01:52:04,780
but the first time I heard the
term technological singularity,

3680
01:52:05,410 --> 01:52:07,930
which describes that point at which we
have computer smarter than human brains,

3681
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,790
is I thought,

3682
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:10,211
oh,

3683
01:52:10,211 --> 01:52:12,700
that's when all of our brains
are plugged into the matrix.

3684
01:52:12,701 --> 01:52:13,690
And we're all this hive mind.

3685
01:52:13,691 --> 01:52:15,940
And we've all replaced every
individual brain cell in our,

3686
01:52:15,941 --> 01:52:17,800
in our skulls with computer chips,

3687
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:18,161
you know,

3688
01:52:18,161 --> 01:52:18,530
like the,

3689
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:18,690
the,

3690
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:18,941
that,

3691
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:19,510
that,

3692
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:21,730
but who knows what that's gonna look like,

3693
01:52:21,731 --> 01:52:22,091
but what,

3694
01:52:22,091 --> 01:52:25,120
but what we're going to experience as
human beings and who knows if our waves

3695
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:26,230
are going to ride that long,

3696
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:26,471
you know,

3697
01:52:26,471 --> 01:52:26,940
if they're,

3698
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:28,060
if they're going to last that long,

3699
01:52:28,061 --> 01:52:30,760
but I think most people alive today are,

3700
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:31,000
you know,

3701
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,420
especially young people are going to
live to experience this and we have a

3702
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:38,110
special motivation than to make sure
that the world that experiences this

3703
01:52:38,111 --> 01:52:40,590
technology is one that
is evolved past statism,

3704
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:41,080
the,

3705
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:41,913
the design,

3706
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:43,030
this thing of government,

3707
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:43,540
of,

3708
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:45,560
of imposing our will
on others by of saying,

3709
01:52:45,561 --> 01:52:45,741
well,

3710
01:52:45,741 --> 01:52:45,980
if it's

3711
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,701
51 percent,

3712
01:52:46,701 --> 01:52:47,534
then it's okay.

3713
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,021
You know,

3714
01:52:48,021 --> 01:52:48,211
of,

3715
01:52:48,211 --> 01:52:49,690
of saying they engaging in,

3716
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:50,121
in this,

3717
01:52:50,121 --> 01:52:51,860
this truly pathological behavior.

3718
01:52:51,861 --> 01:52:53,570
But I'm obviously very optimistic.

3719
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:54,281
Yeah,

3720
01:52:54,281 --> 01:52:54,530
no,

3721
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:56,450
you are very optimistic
and I hope you're right.

3722
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:57,280
Um,

3723
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,220
you might be.

3724
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,091
Who the fuck knows?

3725
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:01,670
I would love it if the story turned out
that we all pulled it together in the

3726
01:53:01,671 --> 01:53:02,091
long run.

3727
01:53:02,091 --> 01:53:03,830
I'm constantly disappointed by people.

3728
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:07,730
I'm constantly disappointed by stories
when I hear about the collapse of Greece

3729
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:08,010
and all,

3730
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:09,830
I'm constantly disappointed like real.

3731
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:12,710
Can anybody fucking keep
it together anywhere?

3732
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:13,940
I'm constantly disappointed.

3733
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,650
Currency on that note.

3734
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:16,340
Hold on a second,

3735
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:19,190
but then I also look at all the
shit that people have accomplished.

3736
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:21,350
What the fuck ever would've
figured out how to build a bridge?

3737
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,690
Who the fuck ever figured
out how to make airplanes?

3738
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:24,070
Who,

3739
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:24,320
how?

3740
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,900
How was there a dude
who really figured out,

3741
01:53:25,901 --> 01:53:28,470
I put satellites up in the
air so I can watch direct tv?

3742
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:29,790
How is that how?

3743
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:31,180
How did all that happen?

3744
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:33,050
If and if all that happened,

3745
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:36,440
I hold out hope for the
possibility that people could,

3746
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:40,760
as much as they have achieved creatively
and technologically with ingenuity,

3747
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:45,970
could also reach the same
level of excellence with
their social engineering and

3748
01:53:47,481 --> 01:53:51,500
the way they treat each other and the
way they develop a community and the way

3749
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:56,150
they project the idea that it's way
better to have a world where everyone is

3750
01:53:56,151 --> 01:53:56,984
happy.

3751
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:01,550
Then to have a world where a few people
dominate people and we have to figure

3752
01:54:01,551 --> 01:54:03,650
out how to do it from the
ground up and it's got to be,

3753
01:54:03,651 --> 01:54:05,330
you got to figure out how
to raise children better.

3754
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:07,670
You've got to figure out how to raise
children better and you've got to deal

3755
01:54:07,671 --> 01:54:09,290
with children that are at that are,

3756
01:54:09,291 --> 01:54:09,561
you know,

3757
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:12,260
in foster homes and that's
got to be handled way better.

3758
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:15,680
You have to look at human
beings as resources and
potential problems if they're

3759
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:16,420
not,

3760
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:17,253
you know,

3761
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:20,360
the last thing anybody wants
to do is grow up through life.

3762
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:22,850
Just constantly dealing
with a fucked up childhood.

3763
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:28,150
I have so many friends That were abused
as children and they are constantly in

3764
01:54:28,251 --> 01:54:30,290
battle with this well into their thirties,

3765
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:33,080
constantly at battle with their childhood.

3766
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:33,801
You know,

3767
01:54:33,801 --> 01:54:36,470
and that's because people raising kids,

3768
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:37,460
they just,

3769
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:38,960
they just do it their way.

3770
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:43,160
It's the Most important resource
that we have as human beings.

3771
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:45,410
And we used to have a
whole fucking community.

3772
01:54:45,411 --> 01:54:47,690
We used to have tribes of us 50,

3773
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:49,550
60 monkey people and we
all fucked each other.

3774
01:54:49,551 --> 01:54:52,880
So nobody knew who the real daddy was
anyway and they are raising these babies

3775
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,180
and you know,

3776
01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:54,420
the,

3777
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:56,780
the whole community and the
tribe raised each other.

3778
01:54:56,781 --> 01:54:57,830
They all stayed together.

3779
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:03,650
When that shit slowly start expanding
into cities and people slowly lost there,

3780
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:04,311
you know,

3781
01:55:04,311 --> 01:55:08,110
you get that diffusion of responsibility
feeling where things are happening.

3782
01:55:08,130 --> 01:55:09,650
It Doesn't feel like it belongs to you.

3783
01:55:09,651 --> 01:55:11,300
It's all those people over there.

3784
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:11,790
You,

3785
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:13,790
you can't be living with
those people over there.

3786
01:55:13,791 --> 01:55:16,700
It should be a giant community or not.

3787
01:55:16,730 --> 01:55:19,070
This is some halfassed
way we're doing it today.

3788
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:20,900
The way we're treating our society.

3789
01:55:20,901 --> 01:55:21,231
It's like,

3790
01:55:21,231 --> 01:55:22,910
it's like you're in my tribe,

3791
01:55:22,911 --> 01:55:23,744
but you're not really.

3792
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,111
I don't know.

3793
01:55:24,111 --> 01:55:24,611
You do.

3794
01:55:24,611 --> 01:55:24,801
You know,

3795
01:55:24,801 --> 01:55:26,030
you just lived down the hall from me.

3796
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:27,980
But still we're all in
the same fucking tribe.

3797
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:29,660
That's the weirdest thing ever.

3798
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,540
It's like your enemy could
be inside your tribe.

3799
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:34,100
That should be impossible.

3800
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:38,810
We should figure out a way where we
are treating everybody the same way.

3801
01:55:38,850 --> 01:55:42,350
this is one of the specific benefits of
technology I'm looking forward to in the

3802
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:43,184
immediate.

3803
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,160
And it's scary when

3804
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:48,180
government control shit like the laser
that can read your chemistry from,

3805
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:51,690
from starbucks really like that.

3806
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:52,650
And.

3807
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:53,670
But if you think about it,

3808
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:57,600
you know what we have with what we're
about to have a head mounted iphone,

3809
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:57,871
right?

3810
01:55:57,871 --> 01:55:58,950
We've got google glasses.

3811
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:00,330
That shit's getting smaller,

3812
01:56:00,331 --> 01:56:00,781
faster,

3813
01:56:00,781 --> 01:56:01,830
better that laser thing.

3814
01:56:01,831 --> 01:56:04,350
Eventually that's going to be embedded
in your contact lens with the rest of

3815
01:56:04,351 --> 01:56:08,460
your smartphone and you're in your ass
and have an injection son eventually

3816
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:09,330
going to be an injection.

3817
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:11,940
It's going to be an intramuscular you
get in the ass because it's a big muscle.

3818
01:56:11,941 --> 01:56:12,774
It's not going to hurt.

3819
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,370
It's going to be deep inside the tissue.

3820
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:15,181
Boom,

3821
01:56:15,181 --> 01:56:16,350
you're hooked up for wifi,

3822
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:18,480
but you got information coming in google.

3823
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,880
The only problem is if you,

3824
01:56:20,881 --> 01:56:21,081
if,

3825
01:56:21,081 --> 01:56:22,830
if the early chips fuck up,

3826
01:56:22,831 --> 01:56:25,740
they have to go in your ass and pull
them out and sometimes you keep a scar.

3827
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:26,880
People would do it.

3828
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,713
Start rusting.

3829
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:33,320
The inevitable symbiotic connection
between humans and machines is no clearly

3830
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:36,930
more easily proven than with phones.

3831
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,003
Oh yeah,

3832
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:38,560
absolutely.

3833
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,920
I fucking panic if I leave my phone,

3834
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:44,070
if I drive in my car and I
hold the house and I'm like,

3835
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,210
I don't have my phone.

3836
01:56:45,211 --> 01:56:45,930
Oh yeah,

3837
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:50,310
I'll be 10 minutes late and it rather
than not be there or you'll be getting the

3838
01:56:50,311 --> 01:56:50,701
shakes.

3839
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:51,060
Right.

3840
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:51,470
Have you,

3841
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:54,130
have you tried to help
yourself away from that?

3842
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:55,250
like I like it.

3843
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:59,640
I've been slowly melting myself away
from facebook and twitter and my phone.

3844
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:02,840
Like I used to be like every time somebody
texts me I have to text them back and

3845
01:57:02,841 --> 01:57:03,870
have to do the call.

3846
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:07,350
Now I just don't even like I'll throw
my phone and just not look at it for two

3847
01:57:07,351 --> 01:57:09,930
hours just because it
is so like two hours.

3848
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:11,520
It a long time know exactly.

3849
01:57:11,521 --> 01:57:13,230
But before I was like 10 minutes,

3850
01:57:13,231 --> 01:57:16,290
I was checking my twitter
or replying to her text.

3851
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:16,831
I can't,

3852
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:17,730
I'm trying not to do.

3853
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:22,800
I don't want you to bother my how crazy
benson that doug benson gets all of his

3854
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:24,510
tweets on his phone.

3855
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:26,760
So if you really want to
fuck with doug benson,

3856
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,980
just tweet him a lot of shit all day
and constantly get fucking vibrations in

3857
01:57:31,981 --> 01:57:32,814
his bucket

3858
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:36,300
that his phone doesn't.

3859
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:36,651
He can't,

3860
01:57:36,651 --> 01:57:36,850
you,

3861
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:37,950
you don't get any of his message.

3862
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:40,170
I don't get any of his tweets and texts.

3863
01:57:40,171 --> 01:57:41,910
Rather he sent me like four or five texts.

3864
01:57:41,911 --> 01:57:42,860
I didn't get a single one of them,

3865
01:57:42,861 --> 01:57:43,171
you know,

3866
01:57:43,171 --> 01:57:44,040
he did it again,

3867
01:57:44,041 --> 01:57:44,580
like uh,

3868
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:45,030
like uh,

3869
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:46,590
the following day he's just been like,

3870
01:57:46,630 --> 01:57:47,200
doing this,

3871
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:50,310
you get this and it doesn't
say delivered like how it does,

3872
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:52,440
but then you text him and it worked fine.

3873
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:53,460
That's so strange.

3874
01:57:53,461 --> 01:57:55,260
But then he texts me back and it was okay.

3875
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:56,473
Yeah,

3876
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:57,570
he texts me back.

3877
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,450
It doesn't make any sense now.

3878
01:57:59,520 --> 01:57:59,641
Yeah.

3879
01:57:59,641 --> 01:58:02,640
He was showing me all the texts
he'd been since June 20th,

3880
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:03,511
probably the cia,

3881
01:58:03,511 --> 01:58:07,560
the cia and the dea are looking at
him as a potential source of all the

3882
01:58:07,561 --> 01:58:08,790
marijuana in California,

3883
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:09,750
if you can imagine,

3884
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:13,560
found out the dog was a drug
dealer and that he was being wired.

3885
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:14,910
That's why he's following us around.

3886
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:16,950
The cia had already compromised him.

3887
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,050
We were in vegas after the show,

3888
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:24,590
we went to go play some slot machines and
we were both smoking out of apples and

3889
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,300
just like getting a.

3890
01:58:26,410 --> 01:58:27,241
By the way I should say,

3891
01:58:27,241 --> 01:58:28,170
I don't really believe that.

3892
01:58:28,171 --> 01:58:31,130
I shouldn't even say that on the internet
because somebody fox go to lock onto

3893
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:31,770
that and thank you.

3894
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:32,730
I was being serious,

3895
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:33,840
sorry,

3896
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,840
but we were smoking some kind of butter
or something out of an apple like weed

3897
01:58:36,841 --> 01:58:40,110
butter and smoking weed
butter or something.

3898
01:58:40,111 --> 01:58:41,190
I forget what it was called,

3899
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:42,190
something

3900
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,023
weird,

3901
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:47,740
but we got so stone we're going to go
play slots and we found the wizard of oz

3902
01:58:47,741 --> 01:58:51,400
slot machine and if you ever have a
chance get really fucking baked and play

3903
01:58:51,401 --> 01:58:54,250
that it trips that we were blown away.

3904
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:56,860
We both almost having panic
attacks playing this slot.

3905
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:00,970
It's just really intense and it has
like this really good sound system like

3906
01:59:00,971 --> 01:59:04,840
that's all around you and then like this
humongous screen and it's just a trip.

3907
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,730
It's like wizard of oz slots.

3908
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:09,790
You're freaking out and you're constantly
checking your little truck crime

3909
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:10,624
tracker.

3910
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:11,110
Right?

3911
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:11,943
It's a small group.

3912
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:14,201
That's what they need.

3913
01:59:14,201 --> 01:59:19,120
A hooker tracker where hookers
or two at mandalay bay.

3914
01:59:19,121 --> 01:59:19,630
Let's go.

3915
01:59:19,630 --> 01:59:20,463
It's common.

3916
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,140
I guarantee it's coming
and they should have like.

3917
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,850
People should have like
yellow lights over.

3918
01:59:24,851 --> 01:59:25,541
They had like,

3919
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:27,040
well she's not really a hooker,

3920
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:28,050
but she has

3921
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,073
thinking about it.

3922
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,240
Does have some bills.

3923
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:33,380
Have you ever stayed at the wynn?

3924
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:34,980
That's amazing.

3925
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:35,741
Amazing.

3926
01:59:35,741 --> 01:59:36,910
Like all tens.

3927
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:37,570
Everywhere.

3928
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:39,350
There's so much security
though that you're not like,

3929
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:40,420
like the nightclubs,

3930
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:40,751
you know?

3931
01:59:40,751 --> 01:59:44,080
How about to stop and just stare at the
nightclub for a second or you have this

3932
01:59:44,081 --> 01:59:45,430
guy coming out of nowhere that goes.

3933
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:46,600
Please continue to walk.

3934
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:53,020
We just found the next location from adam
coachella versus the man coming to you

3935
01:59:54,131 --> 01:59:54,551
live.

3936
01:59:54,551 --> 01:59:55,630
Civil disobedience.

3937
01:59:55,631 --> 01:59:56,980
Body slammed in vegas.

3938
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:00,201
Silly,

3939
02:00:00,201 --> 02:00:01,100
silly people.

3940
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:02,220
That wind is where.

3941
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:03,920
That's the dj ts doe guy,

3942
02:00:03,921 --> 02:00:04,280
right?

3943
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:04,580
Yeah.

3944
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:05,450
What kind of music do you listen to?

3945
02:00:05,451 --> 02:00:07,940
The dude like all rage
against the machine all day.

3946
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:09,320
I'm gLad you would say that,

3947
02:00:09,321 --> 02:00:09,970
but no

3948
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:10,803
fish.

3949
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,650
I'm kind of embarrassed to answer that.

3950
02:00:15,651 --> 02:00:15,881
I like,

3951
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:17,810
I don't have time for music anymore.

3952
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:18,210
Oh,

3953
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:21,080
you guys were in dora for,

3954
02:00:21,081 --> 02:00:21,914
you know,

3955
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:22,851
for,

3956
02:00:22,851 --> 02:00:25,080
for what do you do with
your time that you don't,

3957
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:26,763
that you don't know?

3958
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:27,950
All I do is this.

3959
02:00:27,951 --> 02:00:28,910
I read the news,

3960
02:00:28,911 --> 02:00:30,050
I make youtube videos.

3961
02:00:30,051 --> 02:00:30,291
I,

3962
02:00:30,291 --> 02:00:30,640
you know,

3963
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:33,560
I'm getting better about my daily
routine and get enough sleep.

3964
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:36,200
I used to be really manic and
stay up all night editing videos.

3965
02:00:36,201 --> 02:00:38,030
That always makes you
look a little less crazy.

3966
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:38,361
Yeah,

3967
02:00:38,361 --> 02:00:39,194
exactly.

3968
02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:39,981
Exactly.

3969
02:00:39,981 --> 02:00:43,400
now people think about the
government like he's stoned.

3970
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:43,960
Say no,

3971
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:44,481
you know what?

3972
02:00:44,481 --> 02:00:45,314
I'm stone,

3973
02:00:45,650 --> 02:00:48,260
so you're just stayIng up making
these videos and putting them out.

3974
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:49,810
Well now I'm getting
better about my routine.

3975
02:00:49,811 --> 02:00:53,330
I'm getting some interns that are
really helpful and are able to handle my

3976
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:54,261
productivity yet.

3977
02:00:54,261 --> 02:00:54,530
Well.

3978
02:00:54,530 --> 02:00:57,800
I've actually been operating as an
llc for the last couple of years,

3979
02:00:58,150 --> 02:00:59,370
but you are the man dude.

3980
02:00:59,370 --> 02:01:01,250
You're a part of the machine.

3981
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:02,830
You're an llc now.

3982
02:01:02,850 --> 02:01:04,820
This is how I don't pay as many taxes.

3983
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,421
Oh,

3984
02:01:05,421 --> 02:01:07,680
so you stick it to the give them man.

3985
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:08,570
less weapons.

3986
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,381
Exactly.

3987
02:01:09,381 --> 02:01:10,700
I'm not going to fund new.

3988
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:14,530
You can protest all you want as
long as you keep paying your taxes.

3989
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:16,910
Pretty ridiculous that the government
doesn't give you a receipt.

3990
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:17,240
Like,

3991
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:18,740
tell me what you spent my money on.

3992
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:20,390
Can you at least give me a breakdown?

3993
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:23,240
They don't even have the
courtesy to give you a breakdown.

3994
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:27,380
You know Mr. Koch cash you spend
$40,000 in taxes last year.

3995
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:28,760
This is what went to.

3996
02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:29,900
You have to dig for it.

3997
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:30,621
But no,

3998
02:01:30,621 --> 02:01:30,760
I,

3999
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:33,470
I like 90 percent of my time.

4000
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:36,110
You know that I'm outside of the house.

4001
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,820
If it's not for work,

4002
02:01:37,821 --> 02:01:39,590
like going to a political
events but it's not working.

4003
02:01:39,591 --> 02:01:40,010
I love what I

4004
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,340
do.

4005
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:40,700
Consider it.

4006
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:41,120
If it works,

4007
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,751
you're driven.

4008
02:01:41,751 --> 02:01:43,040
You're absolutely love it.

4009
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:43,550
Yeah.

4010
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:44,311
And it,

4011
02:01:44,311 --> 02:01:44,541
you know,

4012
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:45,650
there are parts of it that our work,

4013
02:01:45,651 --> 02:01:45,981
but it's,

4014
02:01:45,981 --> 02:01:46,940
it's as a whole.

4015
02:01:46,941 --> 02:01:47,481
It's not work.

4016
02:01:47,481 --> 02:01:48,440
I mean I love,

4017
02:01:48,441 --> 02:01:48,980
I love doing.

4018
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,930
I mean we can say it's not work.

4019
02:01:51,090 --> 02:01:51,940
It's there.

4020
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:53,300
There's always work involved.

4021
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:54,200
Even in not work,

4022
02:01:54,201 --> 02:01:55,040
even athletics,

4023
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:57,200
it's fucking work involved
and all and everything,

4024
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,490
but you want to do it is you want the
exact different feeling than working for

4025
02:02:01,491 --> 02:02:05,270
somebody that's working for an
intrinsic goal or for an extrinsic goal.

4026
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:05,600
I'm,

4027
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:07,040
I'm enjoying the experience,

4028
02:02:07,041 --> 02:02:07,791
I'm loving my life.

4029
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:10,370
And then you're doing it
with the right frame of mind.

4030
02:02:10,371 --> 02:02:11,360
With the right spirit.

4031
02:02:11,361 --> 02:02:13,850
you're doing it in the spirit of trying
to change things and help things.

4032
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:18,320
You're not doing it in the spirit
of self randomization or you know,

4033
02:02:18,321 --> 02:02:19,820
you're not trying to pump yourself up.

4034
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,720
And so I go to wholefoods,

4035
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:22,491
I go to target,

4036
02:02:22,491 --> 02:02:25,130
I go to the gym to go to gold's gym,

4037
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:26,390
self grandization.

4038
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:28,610
How do you say it?

4039
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:30,570
Brian is what sells

4040
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:33,290
grandization.

4041
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:33,770
is that what it is?

4042
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:34,191
That's what it is,

4043
02:02:34,191 --> 02:02:34,580
right?

4044
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:36,080
So alpha grandization right?

4045
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:37,850
Sounds so sexy.

4046
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:39,253
Doesn't it

4047
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,320
sound sexy?

4048
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:44,570
So you just go to the gym.

4049
02:02:44,571 --> 02:02:45,770
You just throw on pandora.

4050
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:46,161
Yeah.

4051
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:46,994
And I go,

4052
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:48,170
I go to the mma gym.

4053
02:02:48,171 --> 02:02:49,190
I'm training with a team.

4054
02:02:49,191 --> 02:02:52,040
Lloyd irvin in northern beautiful.

4055
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:52,911
Couldn't do any better.

4056
02:02:52,911 --> 02:02:54,430
That's a beautiful place to train.

4057
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:58,010
I wish he's created a lot
of really high level guys,

4058
02:02:58,011 --> 02:02:59,270
a lot of high level jujitsu guys.

4059
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:02,540
I wish I had more like mentorship,

4060
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:05,100
but I've only been there
since february and I,

4061
02:03:05,150 --> 02:03:05,351
you know,

4062
02:03:05,351 --> 02:03:07,950
I travel a lot on mentorship
after february son.

4063
02:03:08,110 --> 02:03:08,481
I'm onlY,

4064
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:08,811
I've only,

4065
02:03:08,811 --> 02:03:10,220
I'm only going like two
or three days a week,

4066
02:03:10,221 --> 02:03:15,200
so on average to get in whatever you
can get in and if you're on a load,

4067
02:03:15,230 --> 02:03:15,740
you know,

4068
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:16,401
if you're on the road,

4069
02:03:16,401 --> 02:03:16,611
dude,

4070
02:03:16,611 --> 02:03:17,600
hindu squats,

4071
02:03:17,601 --> 02:03:18,560
hindu pushups,

4072
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:21,770
you can get a ferocious workout
and you're fucking hotel room,

4073
02:03:22,210 --> 02:03:22,700
you know,

4074
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:23,990
that's like half the battle,

4075
02:03:23,991 --> 02:03:25,190
especially when it comes to grappling,

4076
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:26,600
half the battle's being in shape.

4077
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:27,411
If you're not in shape,

4078
02:03:27,411 --> 02:03:28,310
it's fucking.

4079
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:29,540
People just outlast you.

4080
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:30,680
And the other half is knowing.

4081
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:35,360
The other half is knowing this
is like the more you know on nbc,

4082
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:39,050
do you have a goal?

4083
02:03:39,051 --> 02:03:42,520
What you're trying to realize
with your show and with the,

4084
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:42,980
you know,

4085
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:43,740
your idea of,

4086
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:44,810
of a revolution.

4087
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:45,693
Do you have a goal?

4088
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:47,130
Try enlightened people.

4089
02:03:47,131 --> 02:03:48,140
Are you trying to change things?

4090
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:48,974
Like what is your,

4091
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:49,903
what's your idea?

4092
02:03:50,530 --> 02:03:54,580
You see it as part of a larger goal of
evolving past statism and getting past

4093
02:03:54,581 --> 02:03:59,050
this particular phase of human evolution
where we institutionalize all of our

4094
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:03,280
desires to dominate and control others
by force into government and you know,

4095
02:04:03,550 --> 02:04:04,450
you understand this,

4096
02:04:04,451 --> 02:04:05,650
you've supported ron paul,

4097
02:04:05,651 --> 02:04:08,980
you've come out and and and you see
when a candidate speaks from this

4098
02:04:08,981 --> 02:04:09,581
philosophy,

4099
02:04:09,581 --> 02:04:12,850
and this is what we have in common
is this idea of volunteerism,

4100
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:13,300
of,

4101
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:15,580
of all human interactions being voluntary,

4102
02:04:15,581 --> 02:04:16,241
free of force,

4103
02:04:16,241 --> 02:04:19,990
fraud and coercion and understanding
that government is what George Washington

4104
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:20,831
described it as.

4105
02:04:20,831 --> 02:04:22,530
It is not eloquence or reason.

4106
02:04:22,531 --> 02:04:24,670
It is like four or it is like fire.

4107
02:04:25,210 --> 02:04:26,580
It is forced like fire,

4108
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:27,390
a dangerous servant,

4109
02:04:27,390 --> 02:04:28,360
a fearful master,

4110
02:04:28,361 --> 02:04:32,680
and when you understand that government
is forced and 99 percent of what it does

4111
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:35,290
or doesn't qualify as a
morally justified use of force,

4112
02:04:35,291 --> 02:04:40,291
whether it's starting wars are collecting
or beating people up for a plant or

4113
02:04:40,621 --> 02:04:42,960
locking them in cages because we
don't like what they're doing.

4114
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:47,820
It's all immoral and we can find
ways to do these things peacefully.

4115
02:04:47,821 --> 02:04:50,460
We can find ways without democracy,

4116
02:04:50,461 --> 02:04:54,600
without the majority imposing its will
by forcing the minority and using this.

4117
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:58,020
Well we have 51 percent
is a cover so we can,

4118
02:04:58,021 --> 02:04:58,200
you know,

4119
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,650
we're justified in doing that and,

4120
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:02,460
and that's part of the bigger goal,

4121
02:05:02,461 --> 02:05:02,761
you know,

4122
02:05:02,761 --> 02:05:02,970
and,

4123
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:04,490
and really this is what,

4124
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:08,490
what I think a lot of people want me
to inspire you to be a part of and to

4125
02:05:08,491 --> 02:05:11,550
really see yourself as someone
who was part of the struggle and,

4126
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:16,560
and someone who can see past someone who
has your wisdom to see past the current

4127
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:19,710
paradigm and see that there is
something better on the other side.

4128
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:21,083
Well I think,

4129
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:22,013
like I said,

4130
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:24,960
there's certainly a potential
for something better,

4131
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,850
but it's going to have to
come through the youth.

4132
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:30,930
They're going to have to grow up into
the system and change it because it's

4133
02:05:30,931 --> 02:05:34,470
changed from the time where people were
wearing white fucking powdered wigs and

4134
02:05:34,471 --> 02:05:36,840
they thought the world was
flat and it's going to change.

4135
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:38,190
Is that an hour as well?

4136
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:39,900
What do you mean?

4137
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:40,560
How is it a cop out?

4138
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:41,393
Because I heard,

4139
02:05:41,850 --> 02:05:46,850
I heard a review of your podcast saying
that you were like a big brother to a

4140
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:48,024
lot of people that,

4141
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,250
that you really serve that role.

4142
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:51,440
I think it's a really powerful one.

4143
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,293
I've tried it,

4144
02:05:52,590 --> 02:05:56,970
that statement about the evolution of
people figuring out things through the

4145
02:05:56,971 --> 02:05:57,751
youth and the youth.

4146
02:05:57,751 --> 02:05:59,290
Learning from the mistakes of the what,

4147
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:02,970
what part of that is a cop out because
you're in a position to be a leader.

4148
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:05,310
You don't have.

4149
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:06,180
You don't have to wait for the youth.

4150
02:06:06,181 --> 02:06:06,391
I mean,

4151
02:06:06,391 --> 02:06:06,720
it's happened.

4152
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,553
This sounds like.

4153
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:08,161
What is it?

4154
02:06:08,161 --> 02:06:08,550
What is that

4155
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:09,120
dude's name?

4156
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:09,630
Not my.

4157
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:10,351
Not charlie sheen.

4158
02:06:10,351 --> 02:06:11,184
What's his brother?

4159
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:15,270
His emilio estevez plot from like 1994.

4160
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:16,830
Um,

4161
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:17,670
what does a leader do?

4162
02:06:17,850 --> 02:06:18,750
What I do,

4163
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:21,840
if it inspires people and
they may choose to act,

4164
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,820
that's my job to do anything else.

4165
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:27,570
It's not my job to do any thing
else is not what I do best.

4166
02:06:27,571 --> 02:06:32,490
It's not what I have in mind when I get
up every day and I wouldn't want to do

4167
02:06:32,491 --> 02:06:33,360
it because I wouldn't be happy.

4168
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:36,360
I don't think that everybody has
to be involved in government.

4169
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:37,110
No,

4170
02:06:37,110 --> 02:06:38,400
it's inside government is.

4171
02:06:38,430 --> 02:06:40,660
Even antigovernment is
the evolution of humanity.

4172
02:06:40,710 --> 02:06:44,890
It's what ron paul talks about it
and getting into a voluntary society.

4173
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:45,571
Well,

4174
02:06:45,571 --> 02:06:46,404
I would certainly,

4175
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:49,430
and that's why I talk about it as
much as possible on the podcast.

4176
02:06:49,431 --> 02:06:53,780
It's my job to inspire and communicate
information and ideas but not delete.

4177
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:55,370
I don't have any desire to do that.

4178
02:06:55,371 --> 02:06:57,080
I don't have any desire
to be a part of that,

4179
02:06:57,081 --> 02:06:57,191
uh,

4180
02:06:57,191 --> 02:06:58,970
have any desire to tell
the people what to do.

4181
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:02,810
I love the idea of being a
leader is disgusting for me,

4182
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,210
which is probably what
you need in a leader.

4183
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:08,420
The real problem with leaders
is they want to be leader.

4184
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:09,740
It's about being no,

4185
02:07:09,741 --> 02:07:10,030
but see,

4186
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:10,431
you're right.

4187
02:07:10,431 --> 02:07:10,761
You're right.

4188
02:07:10,761 --> 02:07:12,550
And it's a different kind of
leadership that we're talking about.

4189
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,700
And I be the best leader
beCause I would be,

4190
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:15,590
I don't want to be a leader.

4191
02:07:15,591 --> 02:07:16,790
I want you should be a fuck.

4192
02:07:16,791 --> 02:07:18,830
I hesitate to use that term myself.

4193
02:07:18,831 --> 02:07:19,140
You know,

4194
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:23,390
and people try to apply it to me and
I say absolutely not because you know,

4195
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:28,010
I can set an example in a way you'd
better have a good handle on your ego when

4196
02:07:28,011 --> 02:07:29,160
you start calling yourself a legal,

4197
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:29,931
a leader.

4198
02:07:29,931 --> 02:07:30,060
You.

4199
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:30,541
But that's why.

4200
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:31,630
That's why I don't.

4201
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:34,220
That's why I don't let
myself think of it that way.

4202
02:07:34,370 --> 02:07:36,610
So I let you talk about someone involved

4203
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:39,450
at the highest levels of political
office that hasn't done psychedelics.

4204
02:07:39,470 --> 02:07:39,731
I'm like,

4205
02:07:39,731 --> 02:07:43,870
you are like a little blindfolded child
behind the wheel of a ferrari and you're

4206
02:07:43,871 --> 02:07:45,040
going to crash that fucking thing.

4207
02:07:45,041 --> 02:07:45,551
You.

4208
02:07:45,551 --> 02:07:47,800
You made it all the way to
the very peak of government.

4209
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:50,320
What did you do along
the way that's gross?

4210
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:51,280
You did something.

4211
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:55,330
What'd you do is somebody that committed
suicide by shooting themselves in the

4212
02:07:55,331 --> 02:07:56,110
head twice.

4213
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:57,340
It was any of those in your closet.

4214
02:07:57,341 --> 02:07:58,630
What the fuck did you do to get here?

4215
02:07:58,631 --> 02:07:59,080
Man,

4216
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:00,160
you don't just get here.

4217
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:00,881
You get here,

4218
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:01,750
you're compromised.

4219
02:08:01,751 --> 02:08:02,560
Period.

4220
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:06,280
To have them get to that stage of
running things and not having psychedelic

4221
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:08,590
experiences is really kind of childlike.

4222
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:10,390
I think the human being,

4223
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:14,830
but so far as to say who haven't
experienced psychedelics are in a in a

4224
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:17,200
childlike mental state of awareness.

4225
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:19,900
I would never say that about them because
I don't know how they feel about the

4226
02:08:19,901 --> 02:08:20,231
world,

4227
02:08:20,231 --> 02:08:23,740
but I know for me I was certainly
very childlike before I did the emt.

4228
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:26,380
I was very self centered.

4229
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:31,930
I had a very different perspective
on my place in the universe,

4230
02:08:32,070 --> 02:08:36,100
a very different perspective
on my place in humanity,

4231
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:37,990
my place with my friends,

4232
02:08:37,991 --> 02:08:42,580
my place that I put everything into
perspective and showed me an illuminated

4233
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:47,610
correct pathway and I think it's by the
humbling experience destroys your ego,

4234
02:08:47,981 --> 02:08:52,060
makes you just sit the fuck down and
stopped trying to control everything.

4235
02:08:52,061 --> 02:08:54,730
It's like the universe is
really a magical place.

4236
02:08:54,731 --> 02:08:58,060
If yOu just absorbed only the
magical aspects of the universe,

4237
02:08:58,061 --> 02:09:00,430
you'd be constantly fascinated
every hour of every day.

4238
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:05,410
BuT we forget that and get caught up
and distracted in the horseshit tmz and

4239
02:09:05,411 --> 02:09:06,520
nonsense and it's just.

4240
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:11,850
We are still struggling with this fucking
weird primate body that is trying to

4241
02:09:13,451 --> 02:09:18,451
figure out how to manage massive
groups of people and insane volumes of

4242
02:09:18,911 --> 02:09:21,190
information coming at us all day long.

4243
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:22,000
And that's,

4244
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,080
that's where we stand now.

4245
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:23,251
That's,

4246
02:09:23,251 --> 02:09:23,710
that's,

4247
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:24,760
that's our conundrum.

4248
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:26,290
Our conundrum is we're,

4249
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,340
we're surfing,

4250
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:29,920
but we might not stay on the
board before we hit the rocks.

4251
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:30,491
You know,

4252
02:09:30,491 --> 02:09:33,670
we might focus you in on this whole
mother fucker and that's no joke.

4253
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:34,240
You know,

4254
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,350
we've just seen a few,

4255
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:37,750
a few interruptions here and there.

4256
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:39,670
One fuck doesn't motivate,

4257
02:09:39,671 --> 02:09:40,250
you know,

4258
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:41,140
doesn't that motivate.

4259
02:09:41,141 --> 02:09:45,490
Certainly motivates me to live the most
out of my life and motivates me to put

4260
02:09:45,491 --> 02:09:48,030
out the most more podcast,

4261
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:50,470
to do more standup comedy,

4262
02:09:50,471 --> 02:09:51,580
to have more fun,

4263
02:09:51,581 --> 02:09:52,271
to enjoy life,

4264
02:09:52,271 --> 02:09:52,981
to enjoy my friends.

4265
02:09:52,981 --> 02:09:53,950
It motivates me to do that.

4266
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:55,030
That's what motivates me to.

4267
02:09:55,110 --> 02:09:55,810
Yeah,

4268
02:09:55,810 --> 02:09:57,140
just I think you have a,

4269
02:09:57,141 --> 02:09:57,431
a,

4270
02:09:57,431 --> 02:09:58,960
a different track.

4271
02:09:58,990 --> 02:09:59,321
You know,

4272
02:09:59,321 --> 02:10:00,250
you're on this.

4273
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,540
We've got to get shit done,

4274
02:10:01,541 --> 02:10:03,240
civil disobedience and go after them.

4275
02:10:03,241 --> 02:10:04,510
If you're on this track,

4276
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:05,171
you know,

4277
02:10:05,171 --> 02:10:06,220
and to say that like,

4278
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:08,740
I'm a leader and I need to
be a part of that track,

4279
02:10:08,741 --> 02:10:09,820
I really don't.

4280
02:10:10,290 --> 02:10:11,170
I really don't.

4281
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:12,610
It's not that you need to be.

4282
02:10:12,611 --> 02:10:13,610
I'm just inviting you to be.

4283
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:13,900
Oh,

4284
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:14,860
I appreciate it.

4285
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:15,581
I appreciate it.

4286
02:10:15,581 --> 02:10:17,650
It's an I'm not saying
that I'm in any way,

4287
02:10:17,651 --> 02:10:18,880
shape or form critical of it.

4288
02:10:18,910 --> 02:10:22,950
I'm inviting you to nurture the part
of you that already is on this track.

4289
02:10:24,450 --> 02:10:27,130
I would never do that if a
guest asks me to nurture it out,

4290
02:10:27,131 --> 02:10:29,140
but it's what you already are.

4291
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:30,880
You already are anti-authoritarian.

4292
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:33,340
You are not anti authoritarian.

4293
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:35,630
What I am is I'm pro nice.

4294
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:36,561
Exactly,

4295
02:10:36,561 --> 02:10:39,230
and the real problem with
any sort of authority.

4296
02:10:39,231 --> 02:10:44,210
I was a fucking security guard for one
summer at great center for the performing

4297
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:46,220
arts place in mansfield,

4298
02:10:46,221 --> 02:10:47,030
Massachusetts.

4299
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:49,850
I got to see fucking amazing bands.

4300
02:10:49,851 --> 02:10:54,310
I got to see rodney dangerfield
performed live naked in a bathrobe.

4301
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:55,880
Rodney dangerfield would wear a bathrobe,

4302
02:10:55,881 --> 02:10:56,240
and I was.

4303
02:10:56,240 --> 02:10:56,810
I was.

4304
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:59,360
Now I feel like I need to take
it about being a comedian man,

4305
02:10:59,390 --> 02:10:59,840
and when I.

4306
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:00,830
This is how we'd go on stage.

4307
02:11:00,831 --> 02:11:02,110
She would go on stage with a bathrobe on.

4308
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:03,530
He was such a bad motherfucker.

4309
02:11:03,531 --> 02:11:05,420
I got to see bill cosby
where I worked there,

4310
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:07,410
but we were at a um,

4311
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:08,570
uh,

4312
02:11:08,570 --> 02:11:08,840
what,

4313
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:09,770
what the fuck is his name?

4314
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:10,670
NoT jethro tull,

4315
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:11,523
goddammit.

4316
02:11:12,110 --> 02:11:13,080
I can't remember his name.

4317
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,410
A southern man.

4318
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:16,120
Neil young,

4319
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:20,800
a neil young concert and
they started fires up in the,

4320
02:11:20,801 --> 02:11:20,880
uh,

4321
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:21,691
there was like a,

4322
02:11:21,691 --> 02:11:24,860
a wooded area or a brother
or a grassy area at the top.

4323
02:11:24,861 --> 02:11:26,480
It was like an amphitheater outside.

4324
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:29,840
And then there was a top area that was
crashed with people decided to start

4325
02:11:29,841 --> 02:11:32,450
fires and fucking hell broke loose dude.

4326
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:35,210
And it became an us versus them thing.

4327
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:37,670
It became a us 19 year old kid.

4328
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:38,770
Security guard,

4329
02:11:38,771 --> 02:11:39,604
you know,

4330
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:44,090
and my friends who also worked there
against all these people who were neil

4331
02:11:44,091 --> 02:11:48,290
young France who were fucked up on drugs
and starting chaos and starting things

4332
02:11:48,291 --> 02:11:48,920
on fire.

4333
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:52,290
And I watched like people hit people
that I'd never would have thought would

4334
02:11:52,291 --> 02:11:53,120
have hit somebody.

4335
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:54,980
Like my friend larry
was one of the nicest,

4336
02:11:55,070 --> 02:11:56,300
most peace loving guys.

4337
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:58,680
And I watched him punch this
dude in the stomach and I'm like,

4338
02:11:58,700 --> 02:11:58,801
well,

4339
02:11:58,801 --> 02:12:00,770
I can't believe larry just hit that guy.

4340
02:12:01,050 --> 02:12:01,380
I was like,

4341
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:03,140
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

4342
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:06,950
But it was an immediate us versus
them thing that happens when you.

4343
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:10,310
It becomes a real problem
if you're not educated,

4344
02:12:10,311 --> 02:12:10,611
right?

4345
02:12:10,611 --> 02:12:13,400
If you work in any position
of authority and position of,

4346
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:13,971
you know,

4347
02:12:13,971 --> 02:12:14,241
we,

4348
02:12:14,241 --> 02:12:14,480
we,

4349
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:17,380
you're going to have some control and
be able to tell people and to build,

4350
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:21,920
you've got to work compassionate to
that because when you don't have that,

4351
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:23,780
when you lose that,

4352
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:24,380
that,

4353
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:25,970
that we're all in this together,

4354
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:27,500
then you're not a cop man.

4355
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,300
You're the fucking enemy like that.

4356
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:30,850
You saw that video in,

4357
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:34,460
in long beach where that kid is
lying down and they step on his head.

4358
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:35,750
Did you see that thomas,

4359
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,730
the one that died in the hospital?

4360
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:38,121
No,

4361
02:12:38,121 --> 02:12:38,301
no,

4362
02:12:38,301 --> 02:12:38,481
no,

4363
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:38,631
no,

4364
02:12:38,631 --> 02:12:38,781
no,

4365
02:12:38,781 --> 02:12:38,931
no,

4366
02:12:38,931 --> 02:12:39,111
no.

4367
02:12:39,111 --> 02:12:39,740
He didn't die.

4368
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:40,071
The kid,

4369
02:12:40,071 --> 02:12:41,660
the kid who was in a,

4370
02:12:41,661 --> 02:12:42,110
uh,

4371
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:44,510
long beach medical marijuana dispensary,

4372
02:12:44,511 --> 02:12:45,344
the cops came in and

4373
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:47,961
stepped on.

4374
02:12:47,961 --> 02:12:48,781
The guy is a real,

4375
02:12:48,781 --> 02:12:49,780
really recent radio.

4376
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:50,623
You might notice it,

4377
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:53,720
but anybody who would
do something like that,

4378
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:57,350
you get a peaceful person
who's just lying down.

4379
02:12:57,380 --> 02:12:58,213
Pathological,

4380
02:12:58,340 --> 02:12:58,920
pathological.

4381
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:01,030
It's the same thing as
what government is it?

4382
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:04,340
It's the same thing that chimps would
do if they could do that to other chips.

4383
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,870
It's fucking primal.

4384
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:06,611
It's prime.

4385
02:13:06,611 --> 02:13:06,711
Oh,

4386
02:13:06,711 --> 02:13:07,640
ridiculous.

4387
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:09,990
Selfish behavior and that's.

4388
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:12,320
That's what really needs to be eradicated.

4389
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:14,570
We need to figure out a
way to connect people.

4390
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:15,200
That's what this.

4391
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:16,220
But that's what this is about.

4392
02:13:16,370 --> 02:13:17,570
That's what this movement is about.

4393
02:13:17,610 --> 02:13:18,000
That's what.

4394
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:18,833
That's what the revolution.

4395
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:20,960
What is the revenue load is the movement.

4396
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:22,710
This was star wars revolution.

4397
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:23,683
The revolution.

4398
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:25,170
You know how you you.

4399
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:28,020
You saw the ron Paul Love
evolution where it's,

4400
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:30,050
it's revolutionary that evil is backwards.

4401
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:30,890
So it says love.

4402
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:31,330
Yes.

4403
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:32,163
That's how we

4404
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:33,270
say the revolution,

4405
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:34,650
and really that's what it's about.

4406
02:13:34,651 --> 02:13:36,910
It's about embracing the,

4407
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:40,000
the divinity of every human being and,

4408
02:13:40,001 --> 02:13:40,121
and,

4409
02:13:40,121 --> 02:13:41,880
and treating every human
being with the love,

4410
02:13:41,881 --> 02:13:43,830
faith and respect that
we want for ourselves,

4411
02:13:43,831 --> 02:13:47,730
and we're coming to the point where
we're realizing this anyways because the

4412
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:49,620
market favors cooperation.

4413
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:50,580
The market favors that.

4414
02:13:50,581 --> 02:13:53,570
People who are able to get along or
able to be more prosperous aren't,

4415
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:53,720
you know,

4416
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:56,160
able to out reproduce
outcompete the ones that aren't.

4417
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:58,590
And so It's kind of happening anyways,

4418
02:13:58,591 --> 02:13:59,900
but what's exciting and,

4419
02:13:59,901 --> 02:14:00,191
and I,

4420
02:14:00,191 --> 02:14:02,000
and really this is why I don't want,

4421
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:03,520
I'm not here to tell you like

4422
02:14:04,030 --> 02:14:05,660
you have an obligation to do this.

4423
02:14:05,661 --> 02:14:06,100
Like you,

4424
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:06,970
if you don't vote,

4425
02:14:06,971 --> 02:14:08,480
you're an irresponsible citizen.

4426
02:14:08,650 --> 02:14:09,590
It's not that bullshit.

4427
02:14:09,591 --> 02:14:14,150
It's just that this is something that
motivates me in the same way that you have

4428
02:14:14,151 --> 02:14:15,200
a similar motivation,

4429
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:15,671
you know.

4430
02:14:15,671 --> 02:14:15,961
And um,

4431
02:14:15,961 --> 02:14:17,300
I'm the oldest of five brothers.

4432
02:14:17,301 --> 02:14:18,260
It's adam,

4433
02:14:18,530 --> 02:14:19,011
andrew,

4434
02:14:19,011 --> 02:14:20,430
alex aldean and andrea my,

4435
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,940
my dad has a big white suburban,

4436
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:23,360
the license plates as 18.

4437
02:14:23,690 --> 02:14:24,050
So,

4438
02:14:24,050 --> 02:14:24,351
you know,

4439
02:14:24,351 --> 02:14:28,430
and for some of them I was more like
a crazy uncle than a big brother.

4440
02:14:28,431 --> 02:14:33,170
But this review that I read
of your podcast was describing
you as big brother to

4441
02:14:33,171 --> 02:14:34,004
your audience.

4442
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:36,080
And I think in that capacity,

4443
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:37,820
being able to

4444
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:38,701
share,

4445
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:39,040
uh,

4446
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:40,370
this vision at least and,

4447
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:41,360
and well,

4448
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:43,320
I think the problem is when you
start calling to revolution,

4449
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:43,891
first of all,

4450
02:14:43,891 --> 02:14:47,760
because then people could sell illusion
because it's an evolution grandizing is

4451
02:14:47,761 --> 02:14:51,900
that what we agreed becomes that it
becomes that you call it whatever love,

4452
02:14:51,901 --> 02:14:52,351
aleutian.

4453
02:14:52,351 --> 02:14:52,870
It's a,

4454
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:53,051
you,

4455
02:14:53,051 --> 02:14:54,510
you define yourself as a movement.

4456
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:56,450
This is come join the movement.

4457
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:57,870
I'm not already in the movement.

4458
02:14:58,800 --> 02:14:59,580
I think you already are.

4459
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:00,450
How my joint things,

4460
02:15:00,451 --> 02:15:01,230
you know what I'm saying,

4461
02:15:01,230 --> 02:15:02,070
but you know what I'm saying.

4462
02:15:02,071 --> 02:15:02,821
Like all of a sudden like,

4463
02:15:02,821 --> 02:15:03,151
okay,

4464
02:15:03,151 --> 02:15:03,760
I'm in.

4465
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:04,550
Well,

4466
02:15:04,550 --> 02:15:04,850
you know,

4467
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:06,150
then then we become a move out.

4468
02:15:06,151 --> 02:15:07,200
Self identification.

4469
02:15:07,230 --> 02:15:07,651
Yeah.

4470
02:15:07,651 --> 02:15:08,700
I don't think that's necessary.

4471
02:15:08,701 --> 02:15:13,701
I think what we are is human beings
that understand that our system is not

4472
02:15:15,241 --> 02:15:17,550
correct and to call
ourselves a revolution,

4473
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:20,160
to call ourselves anything
other than just human beings.

4474
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:21,000
I think it's pointless.

4475
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,950
I think it's rational thinking.

4476
02:15:22,951 --> 02:15:23,521
Human beings.

4477
02:15:23,521 --> 02:15:25,020
It realize there's something wrong here.

4478
02:15:25,110 --> 02:15:28,770
And that includes the people in
the system that includes cops,

4479
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:30,090
that includes judges,

4480
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:31,230
that includes lawyers,

4481
02:15:31,231 --> 02:15:34,470
that includes everybody along the line
that it's all equally eligible for

4482
02:15:34,471 --> 02:15:35,304
personal awakening.

4483
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:39,900
Every single one of them with the proper
medication and the right setting could

4484
02:15:39,901 --> 02:15:43,590
see some shit that would make them rethink
reality and it would make them humble

4485
02:15:43,591 --> 02:15:47,310
enough to at least understand that they
don't know everything because they never

4486
02:15:47,311 --> 02:15:48,450
knew that that was there.

4487
02:15:48,750 --> 02:15:49,291
You can say,

4488
02:15:49,291 --> 02:15:50,280
you know everything.

4489
02:15:50,281 --> 02:15:51,640
I'm a fucking smart guy.

4490
02:15:51,641 --> 02:15:52,710
I was in my class.

4491
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:54,390
I get you high on dmt.

4492
02:15:54,391 --> 02:15:55,530
I guarantee you,

4493
02:15:55,531 --> 02:16:00,300
you will think about everything different
for the rest of your life because you

4494
02:16:00,301 --> 02:16:01,470
didn't know that was there.

4495
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:06,000
You didn't know that all you had to do
was follow a few simple steps and you're

4496
02:16:06,001 --> 02:16:09,000
in a different land where
everything is complex.

4497
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,820
Geometric patterns made out of
love and understanding that,

4498
02:16:11,821 --> 02:16:11,881
uh,

4499
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:16,000
communicating with you in some sort of
a telekinetic language or telekinesis

4500
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:17,003
language,

4501
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:21,480
I don't think that you
can really appreciate life
unless you know that that's

4502
02:16:21,481 --> 02:16:22,290
there.

4503
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:23,550
If you don't know that that's there.

4504
02:16:23,551 --> 02:16:27,630
It's like you've lived three quarters
of a life like you don't understand,

4505
02:16:27,631 --> 02:16:32,140
there's there's an is an experience
and it only takes about 15 minutes and

4506
02:16:32,141 --> 02:16:33,370
you'll never be the same again,

4507
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:37,190
but you're going to come back and you're
going to be burdened with all your past

4508
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:40,360
preconceived notions and ideas and all
the things that you've learned from your

4509
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:40,660
life,

4510
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:42,670
but you're essentially going to
be a totally different person.

4511
02:16:42,671 --> 02:16:46,570
Now you're a person who can never Forget
the things that you saw or the way that

4512
02:16:46,571 --> 02:16:48,430
you felt when you experienced that.

4513
02:16:48,610 --> 02:16:48,731
Now,

4514
02:16:48,731 --> 02:16:51,970
whether that's just your brain getting
tweaked with chemicals or whether it

4515
02:16:51,971 --> 02:16:55,300
really is what it feels like because
what it feels like is you're going to

4516
02:16:55,301 --> 02:16:59,140
another place and we just assumed that
the only way to travel is to put one foot

4517
02:16:59,141 --> 02:16:59,770
in front of the other,

4518
02:16:59,770 --> 02:17:00,311
getting a car,

4519
02:17:00,311 --> 02:17:01,600
getting a plane with them.

4520
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:06,310
you might be able to travel chemically
between dimensions and that might be what

4521
02:17:06,370 --> 02:17:08,410
things like dmt are all about.

4522
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:11,680
That might be why it's made
by your own fucking brain.

4523
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:14,230
Well,

4524
02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:15,063
we should make.

4525
02:17:15,330 --> 02:17:18,910
That's why I probably just started sort
of started this conversatIon by saying,

4526
02:17:18,911 --> 02:17:19,091
hey,

4527
02:17:19,091 --> 02:17:22,510
welcome to this thing that
we're describing as a movement
now because your deal,

4528
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:22,680
man,

4529
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:24,460
I'm being super hyper
critical for no reason,

4530
02:17:24,461 --> 02:17:24,741
but you're,

4531
02:17:24,741 --> 02:17:26,200
you're already a part of this and I,

4532
02:17:26,201 --> 02:17:26,511
and,

4533
02:17:26,511 --> 02:17:26,981
and you know,

4534
02:17:26,981 --> 02:17:29,830
the reason that so many people in
my audience really appreciated this

4535
02:17:29,831 --> 02:17:32,790
conversation and like era
anticipated it is because they,

4536
02:17:32,791 --> 02:17:32,981
they,

4537
02:17:32,981 --> 02:17:37,981
they realize that you already carry this
message in a way very powerfully in the

4538
02:17:38,681 --> 02:17:40,960
way that you talk about society
and the way that you integrate it.

4539
02:17:40,980 --> 02:17:44,170
And what would I just want to do
is that he does want to express my

4540
02:17:44,171 --> 02:17:45,000
appreciation.

4541
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:45,400
Thank you.

4542
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:46,001
Thank you very much.

4543
02:17:46,001 --> 02:17:46,990
but I think everybody does now.

4544
02:17:46,991 --> 02:17:49,210
I think we've reached a point
where I think reached a point.

4545
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:50,093
We're going to melt.

4546
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:53,350
It's the fucking ac down there fixing her.

4547
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:53,650
oh,

4548
02:17:53,650 --> 02:17:54,570
so they shut it off.

4549
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:57,780
Sons pitches a good.

4550
02:17:57,781 --> 02:18:02,550
We feel the heat of suppression that
mother earth gives us and this oppression

4551
02:18:02,551 --> 02:18:04,050
will help us get through
this podcast better.

4552
02:18:04,530 --> 02:18:05,190
Um,

4553
02:18:05,190 --> 02:18:05,551
look,

4554
02:18:05,551 --> 02:18:05,761
man,

4555
02:18:05,761 --> 02:18:07,260
I think everybody's recognizing it now.

4556
02:18:07,261 --> 02:18:09,630
AnYbody with a brain is realizing,

4557
02:18:09,770 --> 02:18:10,320
you know,

4558
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:13,710
bush was the first guy where
everybody had to step back and go,

4559
02:18:13,711 --> 02:18:14,251
wow,

4560
02:18:14,251 --> 02:18:15,780
like because of the access to information,

4561
02:18:15,781 --> 02:18:18,060
that was the first time we got real news,

4562
02:18:18,180 --> 02:18:20,160
daily news online and shit.

4563
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:22,200
There was the first time
people realize like,

4564
02:18:22,201 --> 02:18:22,531
whoa,

4565
02:18:22,531 --> 02:18:22,920
this is,

4566
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:25,950
this administration is
bought and paid for like,

4567
02:18:25,951 --> 02:18:27,240
this is ridiculous.

4568
02:18:27,241 --> 02:18:31,500
Like this is the most obviously bought
and paid like they're rocking it in a way

4569
02:18:31,501 --> 02:18:32,820
that nobody had previously done.

4570
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,320
Everybody had been way slicker about
hiding their connections to money into war

4571
02:18:37,321 --> 02:18:38,154
profiteering,

4572
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:41,580
but the bush administration
just let their freak flag fly.

4573
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,010
They just fucking went out,

4574
02:18:44,670 --> 02:18:45,810
started to wars.

4575
02:18:45,811 --> 02:18:46,950
That made no sense.

4576
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:49,050
Profited a fuck load of money.

4577
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:50,970
if you could talk to George Bush,

4578
02:18:51,150 --> 02:18:52,770
what would that conversation be like?

4579
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:54,720
If you could just get
a loan with that guy,

4580
02:18:54,721 --> 02:18:56,130
would you do it respectfully?

4581
02:18:56,340 --> 02:19:00,870
Would you slowly try to chip away at
it and try to get his perspective?

4582
02:19:00,871 --> 02:19:03,720
Or do you think you would just lose your
fucking mind when you were just in the

4583
02:19:03,721 --> 02:19:07,800
face of someone who is at least indirectly
responsible for the death of probably

4584
02:19:07,801 --> 02:19:11,160
a million people and from
my own ptsd in a sense?

4585
02:19:11,161 --> 02:19:11,730
Yeah,

4586
02:19:11,730 --> 02:19:12,150
sure.

4587
02:19:12,150 --> 02:19:14,130
And what would that be like
to be in front of that guy?

4588
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:17,080
That's a great question.

4589
02:19:17,081 --> 02:19:17,381
You know,

4590
02:19:17,381 --> 02:19:17,690
and I,

4591
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:18,940
and I used to,

4592
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:21,910
when I was active with Iraq
veterans against the war,

4593
02:19:21,911 --> 02:19:24,850
when I got out of the marines and was
disgruntled and started questioning

4594
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:25,181
things,

4595
02:19:25,181 --> 02:19:26,740
I used to fantasize about that,

4596
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:29,110
like a physical violent
guy punch him in the face.

4597
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:31,160
I don't think you should
say that on the radio.

4598
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:32,750
well this was like George Bush.

4599
02:19:32,751 --> 02:19:33,030
you know what?

4600
02:19:33,030 --> 02:19:34,130
I think you can threaten them.

4601
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:35,270
A past president.

4602
02:19:35,271 --> 02:19:36,440
I think you faked do that.

4603
02:19:36,470 --> 02:19:37,010
No,

4604
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:37,940
but is that funny?

4605
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:38,870
They get arrested for that.

4606
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:39,853
I know I've,

4607
02:19:41,170 --> 02:19:43,850
I've had experiences but
now you feel differently.

4608
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:44,630
Well,

4609
02:19:44,630 --> 02:19:45,171
yeah.

4610
02:19:45,171 --> 02:19:50,171
I think part of my own philosophical
development and my own experience going

4611
02:19:51,291 --> 02:19:54,620
through to the point where
I feel like I got to,

4612
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:55,340
you know,

4613
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:56,660
you never get all the way to the bottom,

4614
02:19:56,661 --> 02:19:59,390
but like to the effective bottom
of the rabbit hole for me where I,

4615
02:19:59,450 --> 02:20:02,000
that allows me to function the
way that I do now with the,

4616
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:03,650
my current understanding of the world.

4617
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:04,821
You know,

4618
02:20:04,821 --> 02:20:08,140
part of It was having a
philosophical approach.

4619
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:11,390
There's a quote from a buddhist monk,

4620
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:13,761
thich nhat hahn,

4621
02:20:13,761 --> 02:20:15,110
I'm sure I'm butchering the name,

4622
02:20:15,111 --> 02:20:18,050
but it's something like when
someone does harm to you,

4623
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:22,040
it is only because harm has been done
to them and they are reflecting it back

4624
02:20:22,041 --> 02:20:22,980
and they are expressing and,

4625
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:23,240
and,

4626
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:24,073
and to me,

4627
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:28,400
I see that that is what government
as a whole is in the sense that it's

4628
02:20:28,401 --> 02:20:29,480
pathological behavior.

4629
02:20:29,481 --> 02:20:32,060
It is a relic of human evolution,

4630
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:34,060
of the scarring of the.

4631
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:37,700
The only way we were able to raise kids
in the state of nature was you'll beat

4632
02:20:37,701 --> 02:20:37,821
them.

4633
02:20:37,821 --> 02:20:41,930
So they keep up with the tribe and
the evolution of that into government.

4634
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:45,290
And I see that as a George Bush,

4635
02:20:45,291 --> 02:20:50,291
simply a representation of that broader
social phenomenon of government being

4636
02:20:50,991 --> 02:20:55,340
the last manifestation of this desire
to control and dominate and use violence

4637
02:20:55,341 --> 02:20:55,880
against others.

4638
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:56,713
And so it,

4639
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:57,440
You know,

4640
02:20:57,440 --> 02:21:00,200
and it's not that the president
is a pitch man or a puppet,

4641
02:21:00,650 --> 02:21:01,730
he's a power broker,

4642
02:21:01,731 --> 02:21:01,941
you know,

4643
02:21:01,941 --> 02:21:03,380
he legitimately makes decisions,

4644
02:21:03,381 --> 02:21:04,460
but the reason,

4645
02:21:04,461 --> 02:21:07,100
the one who usually gets into
the position as the one that is,

4646
02:21:07,101 --> 02:21:10,100
is because he's reflective of the
environment that produces them.

4647
02:21:10,101 --> 02:21:11,930
And that's the existing power structure.

4648
02:21:11,931 --> 02:21:13,880
And that's the paradigm
of society as a whole.

4649
02:21:13,881 --> 02:21:18,200
And that's why changing the paradigm
and waking people up and the perspective

4650
02:21:18,201 --> 02:21:21,710
that you share about government is
so powerful because what ultimately

4651
02:21:21,711 --> 02:21:25,220
determines whether or not you are going
to be free is whether the human beings

4652
02:21:25,221 --> 02:21:28,370
around you agree that you should be
free and they won't tolerate people

4653
02:21:28,371 --> 02:21:30,650
initiating force against you
when you're acting peacefully.

4654
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:33,590
So the only way to do that
is to make them happier.

4655
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:34,300
That's,

4656
02:21:34,300 --> 02:21:35,240
that's the real trick,

4657
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:37,460
to get them to lighten the fuck up.

4658
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:38,420
Things are not that bad.

4659
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:39,360
You know,

4660
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:41,420
you really look in perspective,

4661
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:42,440
things are not that Bad,

4662
02:21:42,590 --> 02:21:45,980
but one of my biggest philosophical
influences is stefan molyneux and he went

4663
02:21:45,981 --> 02:21:48,170
through a whole process of
describing this anarcho,

4664
02:21:48,171 --> 02:21:48,681
capitalist,

4665
02:21:48,681 --> 02:21:49,760
ideal society and,

4666
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:51,890
and really to embrace this philosophy,

4667
02:21:51,891 --> 02:21:56,660
you kind of have to go through all of
the resistances that people have like

4668
02:21:57,440 --> 02:21:58,370
without government,

4669
02:21:58,371 --> 02:21:59,600
who's going to build the roads,

4670
02:21:59,601 --> 02:22:00,320
you know,

4671
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:02,130
and it's the same question as,

4672
02:22:02,131 --> 02:22:05,810
as people would ask when we were
trying to abolish slavery and it was,

4673
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:07,100
but without the slaves,

4674
02:22:07,101 --> 02:22:08,350
who's going to pick the content?

4675
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:10,490
Is anything wrong with
having a form of council,

4676
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,150
you know,

4677
02:22:11,150 --> 02:22:12,990
the idea of calling them
government and like,

4678
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:15,620
like what the obama
administration was able to do,

4679
02:22:15,621 --> 02:22:20,000
what the obama administration was able
to do in this whole operation fast and

4680
02:22:20,001 --> 02:22:20,834
furious.

4681
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:22,010
Or hE was able to,

4682
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:22,760
you know,

4683
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:24,920
just say I don't want to
talk about it and why,

4684
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:26,340
what does it invoking executive

4685
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:28,230
order or whatever executive privilege.

4686
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:28,741
I mean,

4687
02:22:28,741 --> 02:22:29,574
how silly is that?

4688
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:30,413
You just let it.

4689
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:34,290
There's a giant scandal where they sold
guns to mexican drug dealers and they

4690
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:34,441
said,

4691
02:22:34,441 --> 02:22:34,701
oh yeah,

4692
02:22:34,701 --> 02:22:34,891
yeah,

4693
02:22:34,891 --> 02:22:35,910
we're just going to track them.

4694
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:38,430
One of those guns justify getting hold.

4695
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:41,780
One of those guns killed
one of the petroleum.

4696
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:42,360
Yeah,

4697
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:47,360
like the idea that he would be able to
use executive privilege and get out of

4698
02:22:47,521 --> 02:22:50,580
that and to do it so blatantly like that.

4699
02:22:50,581 --> 02:22:51,480
That's a creepy thing.

4700
02:22:51,481 --> 02:22:52,920
Like you can't have things like that.

4701
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:53,790
That's what I'm saying.

4702
02:22:53,790 --> 02:22:55,140
That kind of shit like that,

4703
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:55,861
but that's what I'm saying.

4704
02:22:55,861 --> 02:22:57,330
Like in accounting for of council,

4705
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:59,700
that would never exist in
a form of dictatorship.

4706
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:01,980
That's where something like
that to get out of jail free.

4707
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:06,120
It's what do you think that you need
government to accomplish and how you do it

4708
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:07,750
instead of having an arbitrage?

4709
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:09,210
We'd like leaders and the lead,

4710
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:10,620
but I think the leadership,

4711
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:11,640
the anti political,

4712
02:23:11,641 --> 02:23:12,630
it's anti leaders.

4713
02:23:12,631 --> 02:23:12,790
It's,

4714
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:13,450
it's,

4715
02:23:13,450 --> 02:23:13,651
it's,

4716
02:23:13,651 --> 02:23:14,760
it's anti-authoritarian.

4717
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:17,790
It's saying we're not going to
allow ourselves to be cowed.

4718
02:23:17,791 --> 02:23:20,910
We are going to understand that as
human beings and what we call the free

4719
02:23:20,911 --> 02:23:21,540
market,

4720
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:24,990
we are able to cooperatively accomplish
all the things that we've been convinced

4721
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,670
we need government for.

4722
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:27,001
Right?

4723
02:23:27,001 --> 02:23:27,870
I understand that,

4724
02:23:27,871 --> 02:23:29,980
but someone's gonna have
to execute decision.

4725
02:23:29,981 --> 02:23:31,710
Someone's gonna have to
put things in motion.

4726
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:34,230
He going to have to a group code examples.

4727
02:23:34,231 --> 02:23:35,640
what is the thing that needs to get done,

4728
02:23:35,641 --> 02:23:39,840
whether you know it might
not have a consensus of how
many cops need to be hired

4729
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:43,460
as opposed to how many teachers need to
be hired and how much they should get

4730
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:44,730
people paying for those services.

4731
02:23:44,790 --> 02:23:45,421
How do they do that?

4732
02:23:45,421 --> 02:23:46,410
They do that wIth a form of government.

4733
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:46,951
They get together,

4734
02:23:46,951 --> 02:23:47,784
they have council,

4735
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:49,140
they do it through corporations.

4736
02:23:49,141 --> 02:23:52,110
They do it through companies where they
able to buy protection services where

4737
02:23:52,111 --> 02:23:56,190
they're able to get the the the legitimate
services that police provide without

4738
02:23:56,191 --> 02:23:59,910
forcing it on people just because
they happen to even teachers meet.

4739
02:23:59,911 --> 02:24:03,360
Even deciding what salaries are you
going to have to have some sort of a way

4740
02:24:03,361 --> 02:24:05,700
that people can interact with each other
and someone's going to have to execute

4741
02:24:05,701 --> 02:24:05,790
it.

4742
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:06,720
That's called the free market,

4743
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:10,920
but that person who executes it should
be someone who respected council,

4744
02:24:10,921 --> 02:24:11,770
someone who knows you.

4745
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:16,020
Take advantage of the fact that why
are people doing their jobs jobs,

4746
02:24:16,021 --> 02:24:16,950
the ceo of apple.

4747
02:24:18,310 --> 02:24:18,590
Why?

4748
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:19,170
What book?

4749
02:24:19,170 --> 02:24:20,940
What made steve jobs the ceo of apple,

4750
02:24:20,941 --> 02:24:23,430
very creatIve guy started
off market forces.

4751
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:28,140
He was the most valuable one to be in
the command of those market resources,

4752
02:24:28,141 --> 02:24:31,200
so you want to turn the government
and how things run into it.

4753
02:24:31,201 --> 02:24:33,090
Just a big free market as far as police,

4754
02:24:33,091 --> 02:24:34,110
as far as teachers,

4755
02:24:34,111 --> 02:24:35,210
everything's just a giant freedom.

4756
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:36,510
I want to take the violence out of.

4757
02:24:36,511 --> 02:24:37,620
I don't want to take the coercion now.

4758
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:40,380
You don't want it to be accomplished
peacefully by people cooperating.

4759
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:41,214
Instead of saying,

4760
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:41,461
oh,

4761
02:24:41,461 --> 02:24:41,641
well,

4762
02:24:41,641 --> 02:24:42,151
you live here,

4763
02:24:42,151 --> 02:24:43,140
you're going to pay these taxes.

4764
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:43,291
Oh,

4765
02:24:43,291 --> 02:24:43,411
well,

4766
02:24:43,411 --> 02:24:43,891
you live here.

4767
02:24:43,891 --> 02:24:45,330
You're going to be under someone's gonna.

4768
02:24:45,331 --> 02:24:48,330
Have to organize how the
hospital gets kept up.

4769
02:24:48,331 --> 02:24:50,580
Is that going to be a public
thing or is that going to be.

4770
02:24:50,581 --> 02:24:54,110
I mean you opposed to everything will
look at how much more public space station

4771
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:55,410
are you opposed to public.

4772
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,530
I'm opposed to education
that's funded by violence.

4773
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:01,091
How was it founded?

4774
02:25:01,091 --> 02:25:01,570
By allowance?

4775
02:25:01,570 --> 02:25:02,403
What do you mean by that?

4776
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:06,530
You think a child going to school doesn't
understand that if they don't go to

4777
02:25:06,531 --> 02:25:07,250
school everyday,

4778
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:10,600
their parents get in trouble and that
the way the school is paid for by taxes

4779
02:25:10,610 --> 02:25:12,530
that the parents pay against their will.

4780
02:25:12,531 --> 02:25:14,600
Whether or not they have
children in a school system,

4781
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:15,681
children get that.

4782
02:25:15,681 --> 02:25:17,030
They understand that we grow up,

4783
02:25:17,031 --> 02:25:17,600
but this is this.

4784
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:18,730
This is the status,

4785
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:21,170
but that's one way way of looking at it.

4786
02:25:21,171 --> 02:25:24,070
It's also true that parents pay taxes

4787
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,800
in a very specific neighborhood because
they know there's a good school system

4788
02:25:26,801 --> 02:25:31,030
in there and then they run rallies for
the school system and they gather up

4789
02:25:31,031 --> 02:25:31,900
money and people don't,

4790
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,040
and so that's also true.

4791
02:25:33,041 --> 02:25:35,350
I see that and so that in
community schools as well,

4792
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:36,820
that it's not always negative.

4793
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:37,061
Okay.

4794
02:25:37,061 --> 02:25:37,990
That aspect of it,

4795
02:25:37,991 --> 02:25:38,411
however,

4796
02:25:38,411 --> 02:25:39,400
is superior.

4797
02:25:39,401 --> 02:25:43,330
Is it not to the federal department of
education coming into that community and

4798
02:25:43,331 --> 02:25:46,000
st now you're going to follow these
testing standards in order to get these

4799
02:25:46,001 --> 02:25:48,190
funds and if you don't
do what we say with this.

4800
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:48,991
So I'm all.

4801
02:25:48,991 --> 02:25:51,190
I'm saying it's nice
that a careful community.

4802
02:25:51,220 --> 02:25:51,790
Yes.

4803
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:52,900
You see that difference.

4804
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:55,390
So that community should be
determined not by people.

4805
02:25:56,970 --> 02:25:57,191
I mean,

4806
02:25:57,191 --> 02:25:57,700
what do you.

4807
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:58,510
How is this,

4808
02:25:58,510 --> 02:26:02,110
how is the money paying the teachers?

4809
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:03,400
How is that coming from violence?

4810
02:26:03,401 --> 02:26:03,881
I don't understand.

4811
02:26:03,881 --> 02:26:04,900
How do you pay taxes?

4812
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:05,650
What happens?

4813
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:06,970
What happens if you don't pay taxes?

4814
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:09,850
We're not contributing to society.

4815
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:11,410
I mean I don't think we should.

4816
02:26:12,090 --> 02:26:16,420
Tax says we are not contributing
to wider to corruption.

4817
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:17,283
That is true.

4818
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:18,160
So it's.

4819
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:20,140
So do you think that all taxes are bad?

4820
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:21,540
Do you think that we should have no taxes?

4821
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:22,630
Taxes are a moral.

4822
02:26:23,290 --> 02:26:24,370
All taxes are moral.

4823
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:27,130
So how do we expect to
pay for the city streets?

4824
02:26:27,131 --> 02:26:30,720
How do we expect to pay to
maintain some sort of a,

4825
02:26:30,721 --> 02:26:31,100
a,

4826
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:31,450
a,

4827
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:35,140
a presence with police officers
and fund them with cars?

4828
02:26:35,141 --> 02:26:36,400
Is it all just donations?

4829
02:26:36,460 --> 02:26:36,760
No,

4830
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:37,031
it will.

4831
02:26:37,031 --> 02:26:39,520
This is the difference between what we
have with government and what we already

4832
02:26:39,521 --> 02:26:40,480
have in the free market.

4833
02:26:40,630 --> 02:26:42,100
Do people pay for protection?

4834
02:26:42,101 --> 02:26:42,291
Then?

4835
02:26:42,291 --> 02:26:44,020
Does it become you can do it.

4836
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:44,831
The community.

4837
02:26:44,831 --> 02:26:45,910
That sounds like a good idea.

4838
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:46,510
You can do it.

4839
02:26:46,510 --> 02:26:50,620
The private cops that decided to not
save you because you didn't pay for

4840
02:26:50,621 --> 02:26:51,454
protection.

4841
02:26:51,610 --> 02:26:54,310
The differences with them
all You get is protection.

4842
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:55,780
Whereas with the police today,

4843
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:56,950
do we get protection?

4844
02:26:56,951 --> 02:26:57,784
Sometimes you do.

4845
02:26:57,910 --> 02:26:58,180
No,

4846
02:26:58,180 --> 02:26:59,013
that's not true.

4847
02:26:59,230 --> 02:27:00,063
Good cops.

4848
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:00,650
There's,

4849
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:00,891
there's,

4850
02:27:00,891 --> 02:27:01,890
there's good cops out there.

4851
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:02,141
Okay.

4852
02:27:02,141 --> 02:27:03,340
Well what is not all bad?

4853
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:04,570
All cops are not bad.

4854
02:27:04,571 --> 02:27:07,780
Just because some cops do a bunch of
stupid shit and those guys in the video

4855
02:27:07,781 --> 02:27:08,720
with you are clearly bad.

4856
02:27:08,721 --> 02:27:08,841
Okay,

4857
02:27:08,841 --> 02:27:09,490
so wouldN't.

4858
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:11,290
This is the mechanism
by which you separate.

4859
02:27:11,291 --> 02:27:12,610
The good cops are on the bad cops.

4860
02:27:12,730 --> 02:27:14,040
There are the ones.

4861
02:27:14,050 --> 02:27:14,150
No,

4862
02:27:14,150 --> 02:27:14,350
no.

4863
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:17,500
This is the mechanism by which you
actually do it is you take the arbitrary

4864
02:27:17,501 --> 02:27:18,880
power of government away from them.

4865
02:27:18,881 --> 02:27:20,170
You make them serve the market.

4866
02:27:20,171 --> 02:27:21,790
You make them serve the people peacefully.

4867
02:27:22,030 --> 02:27:25,750
You make them convince you that
their services are necessary,

4868
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:27,190
not put a gun to your head and say,

4869
02:27:27,191 --> 02:27:28,360
if you don't pay our taxes,

4870
02:27:28,361 --> 02:27:29,530
you're going to get locked in a cage.

4871
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:30,401
Well,

4872
02:27:30,401 --> 02:27:35,110
I think that locking someone in jail
for taxes is very unfortunate and it

4873
02:27:35,111 --> 02:27:37,990
doesn't make sense when you think about
how many fucking gigantic corporations

4874
02:27:37,991 --> 02:27:40,270
have gone bankrupt and how
much more that affected people.

4875
02:27:40,271 --> 02:27:44,020
Then You know one person who's not paying
the little tiny slice of the military

4876
02:27:44,021 --> 02:27:45,460
industrial complex is pie,

4877
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:47,920
but you should have to pay something.

4878
02:27:47,921 --> 02:27:50,710
It should make sense that you're getting
something out of it and you should want

4879
02:27:50,711 --> 02:27:51,544
to contribute.

4880
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:54,640
I live in a community and if everybody,

4881
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:55,720
if everybody said,

4882
02:27:55,721 --> 02:27:55,841
well,

4883
02:27:55,841 --> 02:27:56,250
hey man,

4884
02:27:56,250 --> 02:27:57,880
our streets are all fucked up,

4885
02:27:57,881 --> 02:28:00,370
but it mike gathered up all the names.

4886
02:28:00,371 --> 02:28:04,330
Everybody lives here and realize
if we all just chip in $100,

4887
02:28:04,331 --> 02:28:05,380
we could fix this whole thing.

4888
02:28:05,381 --> 02:28:07,570
I think it's worth it for me for $100 gun.

4889
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:08,171
And everybody goes,

4890
02:28:08,171 --> 02:28:08,620
yeah,

4891
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:09,540
that would be beautiful.

4892
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:11,050
I'm talking about government.

4893
02:28:11,051 --> 02:28:11,591
That's great.

4894
02:28:11,591 --> 02:28:12,270
That's exactly.

4895
02:28:12,270 --> 02:28:14,520
The technology allows us all the way.

4896
02:28:14,521 --> 02:28:16,780
They didn't have jobs if we
didn't have responsibility,

4897
02:28:16,781 --> 02:28:17,321
children,

4898
02:28:17,321 --> 02:28:17,891
careers,

4899
02:28:17,891 --> 02:28:19,420
if we didn't have things we
had to think about all day.

4900
02:28:19,421 --> 02:28:22,040
Instead you're running around out
there trying to figure out how to pay

4901
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,700
the firemen and how to make sure that
the cop tires are good and you know,

4902
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:27,050
at a certain point in time,

4903
02:28:27,051 --> 02:28:29,400
how much micromanagement can
you do in your community.

4904
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,293
Why w w,

4905
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:31,520
how is it for cable now?

4906
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:32,090
Internet,

4907
02:28:32,090 --> 02:28:33,130
tv and your in your,

4908
02:28:33,220 --> 02:28:33,740
in your,

4909
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:34,431
in your house.

4910
02:28:34,431 --> 02:28:36,290
How is it that you get
that without government?

4911
02:28:37,150 --> 02:28:37,640
Uh,

4912
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:38,060
so you.

4913
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:41,420
But you proposed that for things
that we think of as civil services,

4914
02:28:41,421 --> 02:28:41,641
right?

4915
02:28:41,641 --> 02:28:42,560
And he proposed that for like,

4916
02:28:42,561 --> 02:28:43,510
cops will look at it.

4917
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:47,290
I just seen that kills tricky man hops.

4918
02:28:47,390 --> 02:28:48,440
That's mercenaries.

4919
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:49,790
Think about what the fuck is going on.

4920
02:28:49,791 --> 02:28:54,110
And I ran right now the
problem with mercenaries is
that they do things that the

4921
02:28:54,111 --> 02:28:55,190
government funds them to do.

4922
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:56,630
That the market would never support.

4923
02:28:57,650 --> 02:28:58,470
That ties.

4924
02:28:58,470 --> 02:29:01,460
People only won't only want
cops to do legitimate things.

4925
02:29:01,461 --> 02:29:04,820
The only way that you have mercenaries
doing things that are immoral is because

4926
02:29:04,821 --> 02:29:06,440
it's funded by government
in the first place.

4927
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:06,651
okay.

4928
02:29:06,651 --> 02:29:07,880
I can see that argued easily.

4929
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:08,440
Um,

4930
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:08,640
if,

4931
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:11,840
if tHey don't have a specific set of
rules and are only open to the market,

4932
02:29:11,841 --> 02:29:14,810
they're going to push as far as they
possibly can to get things done.

4933
02:29:14,990 --> 02:29:17,150
And if they're dealing with
businesses that have a lot of money,

4934
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:18,710
they're going to do
things that aren't legal.

4935
02:29:18,830 --> 02:29:21,890
But that's what would happen if you
privatize the cops and that's a fact.

4936
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:23,360
That's just how human beings are.

4937
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:26,420
If you give them little loopholes and
you allow them to figure out how to get

4938
02:29:26,421 --> 02:29:27,254
through those loopholes,

4939
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:29,810
they're like rats on a sinking ship and
they're going to pop out and they're

4940
02:29:29,811 --> 02:29:30,621
going to fuck things up.

4941
02:29:30,621 --> 02:29:30,830
No,

4942
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:31,461
because the only,

4943
02:29:31,461 --> 02:29:31,570
you're,

4944
02:29:31,570 --> 02:29:31,811
you're,

4945
02:29:31,811 --> 02:29:34,430
you're basing that on an understanding
of the corporate structure of the current

4946
02:29:34,431 --> 02:29:37,670
government paradigm where government
empowers corporations to have an unnatural

4947
02:29:37,671 --> 02:29:39,950
advantage in the market and
protect them from competition.

4948
02:29:39,950 --> 02:29:40,910
So cops,

4949
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:41,300
man,

4950
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:41,631
hold on.

4951
02:29:41,631 --> 02:29:41,751
No,

4952
02:29:41,751 --> 02:29:41,900
no.

4953
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:42,541
In your scenario,

4954
02:29:42,541 --> 02:29:42,831
you say,

4955
02:29:42,831 --> 02:29:46,610
rich people like existing corporations
and concentrations of wealth would abuse

4956
02:29:46,611 --> 02:29:50,750
this ability to hire police forces and
private whatever to be able to do evil

4957
02:29:50,751 --> 02:29:51,021
things.

4958
02:29:51,021 --> 02:29:51,141
Well,

4959
02:29:51,141 --> 02:29:51,501
guess what?

4960
02:29:51,501 --> 02:29:52,334
They already can.

4961
02:29:52,550 --> 02:29:55,550
The thing iS what we have is a government
that keeps the rest of us from doing

4962
02:29:55,551 --> 02:29:56,384
the same thing.

4963
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:59,990
From being able to say that our
demands for community safety services,

4964
02:29:59,991 --> 02:30:01,910
our demands are being met by the market,

4965
02:30:01,911 --> 02:30:03,470
not by a monopoly that's forced on us.

4966
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:05,720
This is why this is the
premise of the drug war man.

4967
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:06,441
You do this.

4968
02:30:06,441 --> 02:30:07,490
The drug war goes away.

4969
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:08,151
You do this.

4970
02:30:08,151 --> 02:30:12,500
All unjust laws go away
because the demands on the
enforcers are the demands of

4971
02:30:12,501 --> 02:30:13,071
the market there.

4972
02:30:13,071 --> 02:30:14,330
What people actually want.

4973
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:16,670
The bad cops go away because
you get to fiRe them.

4974
02:30:16,671 --> 02:30:21,170
There's no police unions that say you
can't fire people and there's going to be

4975
02:30:21,171 --> 02:30:23,990
a law against this that
if a cop shoots somebody,

4976
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:25,400
he's going to get paid leave.

4977
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:26,510
You know that kind of bullshit.

4978
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:28,640
All of that goes away when you have roads.

4979
02:30:28,641 --> 02:30:31,610
Like I was telling you the way that
they're holding us back from technological

4980
02:30:31,611 --> 02:30:32,091
development,

4981
02:30:32,091 --> 02:30:35,360
but specifically like in New Mexico where
the speaker of the house gets to just

4982
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:35,451
say,

4983
02:30:35,451 --> 02:30:35,601
well,

4984
02:30:35,601 --> 02:30:37,250
put that intersection by my land.

4985
02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:38,750
so the value of it goes up.

4986
02:30:38,900 --> 02:30:39,920
All of that goes away.

4987
02:30:40,130 --> 02:30:40,671
And to say that,

4988
02:30:40,671 --> 02:30:40,821
well,

4989
02:30:40,821 --> 02:30:42,980
we need corruption goes away.

4990
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:43,640
Yes.

4991
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:44,630
How does corruption go away?

4992
02:30:44,990 --> 02:30:49,070
Because it's in order to make money in
the free market and this is the free

4993
02:30:49,071 --> 02:30:49,401
market.

4994
02:30:49,401 --> 02:30:50,660
Makes corruption go with will.

4995
02:30:50,750 --> 02:30:51,583
Hold on a second.

4996
02:30:51,670 --> 02:30:51,870
The,

4997
02:30:51,870 --> 02:30:52,050
the,

4998
02:30:52,050 --> 02:30:55,370
the capitalist ideal is
that it's free individuals,

4999
02:30:55,371 --> 02:30:59,600
multiple parties are able to engage
in trade because it mutual is a mutual

5000
02:30:59,601 --> 02:31:00,051
benefit,

5001
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:00,570
right?

5002
02:31:00,570 --> 02:31:01,140
I,

5003
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:01,973
you know,

5004
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:02,691
I give you something,

5005
02:31:02,691 --> 02:31:03,351
you give me something.

5006
02:31:03,351 --> 02:31:04,910
We both believe that
we're better off from it.

5007
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:07,700
This is the basic concept of capitalism,

5008
02:31:07,701 --> 02:31:08,534
of free trade,

5009
02:31:08,750 --> 02:31:13,610
of application of yourself as a capital
resource engaged in the free market and

5010
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:15,860
anytime you introduce coercion into that,

5011
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:19,980
you take away from our ideal
potential as humanity to engage

5012
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,813
in commerce.

5013
02:31:21,090 --> 02:31:21,923
No argument with that.

5014
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:23,250
So that's what government does.

5015
02:31:23,251 --> 02:31:24,150
And so if you had,

5016
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:28,800
if you had the ability now
is we do technologically
obviously to pool resources

5017
02:31:28,801 --> 02:31:29,070
to come.

5018
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:30,750
You're saying you're calling government,

5019
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:31,251
you're,

5020
02:31:31,251 --> 02:31:33,480
you're defining human
nature as government.

5021
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:35,250
You're saying anybody with power,

5022
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:36,390
you defining that as government?

5023
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:36,751
No,

5024
02:31:36,751 --> 02:31:39,960
I'm just saying that would happen
in your private top system too,

5025
02:31:39,990 --> 02:31:40,290
right?

5026
02:31:40,290 --> 02:31:40,531
Right.

5027
02:31:40,531 --> 02:31:40,710
No,

5028
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:41,300
probably wouldn't work.

5029
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:41,810
Right?

5030
02:31:41,810 --> 02:31:45,740
What I'm saying is that government is
the current manifestation of human desire

5031
02:31:45,741 --> 02:31:47,530
to control and dominate others by forest.

5032
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:48,960
This is the preMise.

5033
02:31:48,961 --> 02:31:50,790
So that's the only way to
govern what you're saying.

5034
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:50,941
Well,

5035
02:31:50,941 --> 02:31:54,210
the only way to cover this definition
of governing and without that it's

5036
02:31:54,211 --> 02:31:56,670
impossible to have like a
compassionate leadership.

5037
02:31:56,671 --> 02:31:57,510
It's impossible.

5038
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:57,701
No,

5039
02:31:57,701 --> 02:31:59,750
with that you have cooperation,

5040
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:01,980
you have leadership of people
that are doing good work.

5041
02:32:01,981 --> 02:32:03,420
So that's a government know.

5042
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:05,200
What is the leadership then if there's,

5043
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:07,860
if there's a leadership that
you've got a government,

5044
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:09,360
if you've got someone who's leading,

5045
02:32:09,361 --> 02:32:10,194
you've got a government.

5046
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:11,180
So you've got another government,

5047
02:32:11,181 --> 02:32:12,200
you got to benevolent government.

5048
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:14,370
Steve jobs was in a leader
in the technological field.

5049
02:32:14,371 --> 02:32:16,860
I think steve jobs was a general of apple.

5050
02:32:16,890 --> 02:32:17,371
Absolutely.

5051
02:32:17,371 --> 02:32:17,970
So was he,

5052
02:32:17,970 --> 02:32:18,803
was he government?

5053
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:19,800
Yes.

5054
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:20,551
Absolute jobs.

5055
02:32:20,551 --> 02:32:21,450
Was government for sure.

5056
02:32:21,451 --> 02:32:23,210
If you were involved with that,

5057
02:32:23,230 --> 02:32:25,980
finding government involved with
apple and you left your phone,

5058
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:26,460
uh,

5059
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:29,010
you the prototype phone
in a bar somewhere,

5060
02:32:29,011 --> 02:32:29,731
even though it's awesome.

5061
02:32:29,731 --> 02:32:32,020
Free publicity that you
would be arrested or you,

5062
02:32:32,050 --> 02:32:32,480
you would,

5063
02:32:32,480 --> 02:32:34,320
they would for sure they check the guy.

5064
02:32:34,321 --> 02:32:37,230
They fucking storm troopers
house with machine guns.

5065
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:41,170
Looked everywhere for the iphone then
that mean is that not like government

5066
02:32:41,171 --> 02:32:41,620
would do?

5067
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:42,750
That's exactly what the
government would do.

5068
02:32:42,751 --> 02:32:43,710
And then they fire the guy.

5069
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:45,210
That's exactly what the
government would do.

5070
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:45,550
Yeah.

5071
02:32:45,550 --> 02:32:47,130
So I'd say steve jobs was the government.

5072
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:47,851
Okay,

5073
02:32:47,851 --> 02:32:48,684
well then then we're,

5074
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:50,250
we're still sort of talking about.

5075
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:51,720
And that is a corporation.

5076
02:32:51,721 --> 02:32:53,190
I mean that is the real free market.

5077
02:32:53,191 --> 02:32:55,560
I mean the corporation
is the village of apple.

5078
02:32:55,590 --> 02:32:55,770
Okay.

5079
02:32:55,770 --> 02:32:58,470
But you're throwing up
these objections that are,

5080
02:32:58,471 --> 02:33:00,940
that are just objections
are totally not objective.

5081
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:01,700
These are all,

5082
02:33:01,700 --> 02:33:04,530
this is all just a devil's advocate,

5083
02:33:04,531 --> 02:33:04,941
but then it's an,

5084
02:33:04,941 --> 02:33:06,060
it's an important thing to say.

5085
02:33:06,061 --> 02:33:07,050
but like I said,

5086
02:33:07,051 --> 02:33:09,990
when when you were living
under slavery and someone said,

5087
02:33:09,991 --> 02:33:10,141
hey,

5088
02:33:10,141 --> 02:33:11,280
we need to end slavery.

5089
02:33:11,410 --> 02:33:11,620
The,

5090
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:11,850
the,

5091
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:13,530
the devil's advocate was saying,

5092
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:15,120
but who's going to pick the cotton?

5093
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:16,253
And the answer is,

5094
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:17,580
it may understand.

5095
02:33:17,860 --> 02:33:21,810
I'm not saying that you should
have an oppressive government.

5096
02:33:21,930 --> 02:33:26,130
I'm saying can't we have people that we
really love and respect real leaders?

5097
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:29,040
Because if you look at a
guy like bill clinton now,

5098
02:33:29,041 --> 02:33:30,870
now that he stopped chasing
tail and everything,

5099
02:33:31,050 --> 02:33:31,670
you know,

5100
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:32,420
you think he stopped,

5101
02:33:32,420 --> 02:33:33,253
he think he stops.

5102
02:33:35,290 --> 02:33:35,641
He'll think.

5103
02:33:35,641 --> 02:33:36,830
So imagine those,

5104
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:39,360
those girls and their hard drives,

5105
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:41,010
clinton picks.

5106
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:42,530
If they wouldn't stop there,

5107
02:33:42,531 --> 02:33:43,351
be clinton dick pics,

5108
02:33:43,351 --> 02:33:43,591
man.

5109
02:33:43,591 --> 02:33:45,360
Don't you think there'll
be worth so much money?

5110
02:33:45,390 --> 02:33:46,680
How can the girls keep your mouth shut?

5111
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:48,840
do you know how many
people clinton is killed?

5112
02:33:49,430 --> 02:33:50,850
I wonder how many people clinton's killed.

5113
02:33:50,851 --> 02:33:51,301
You think he's filled?

5114
02:33:51,301 --> 02:33:52,440
A lot of people know,

5115
02:33:52,441 --> 02:33:53,760
but I think after you suck his dick,

5116
02:33:53,761 --> 02:33:54,750
you get a little briefing.

5117
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:56,460
Do you think that.

5118
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:58,530
Did you ever read the strange
death of vince foster?

5119
02:33:58,590 --> 02:33:58,811
You know,

5120
02:33:58,811 --> 02:33:59,700
the story that guy,

5121
02:33:59,870 --> 02:34:01,230
it's one of the guys involved.

5122
02:34:01,231 --> 02:34:04,050
And somehoW or another he had some sort
of connection to that giant real estate

5123
02:34:04,051 --> 02:34:07,490
deal that the clintons were
involved in were fucking this.

5124
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:07,651
Yeah,

5125
02:34:07,651 --> 02:34:09,230
that's what I'm talking about there.

5126
02:34:09,430 --> 02:34:13,770
There was a guy that went around
that had this list of 70 people that

5127
02:34:13,771 --> 02:34:15,210
mysteriously died around.

5128
02:34:15,210 --> 02:34:17,980
The clinton family might
just be how things are done.

5129
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:21,100
It might just be how at a
certain point in government,

5130
02:34:21,101 --> 02:34:23,050
everybody just knows
that's how shit's done.

5131
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,370
And it's always been that way.

5132
02:34:24,930 --> 02:34:25,480
And you know,

5133
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:26,950
here's the zapruder film.

5134
02:34:27,130 --> 02:34:27,963
I mean it's just,

5135
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:29,020
oh,

5136
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:30,100
he's been that way.

5137
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:30,963
It seems like.

5138
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:31,871
I mean,

5139
02:34:31,871 --> 02:34:34,000
you don't bomb out all the
things that obama said.

5140
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:34,331
You know,

5141
02:34:34,331 --> 02:34:36,730
you think about the stores
of obama being in Hawaii,

5142
02:34:36,731 --> 02:34:38,050
smoking pot with his friends.

5143
02:34:38,230 --> 02:34:38,771
His friends had.

5144
02:34:38,771 --> 02:34:40,320
obama would go interception step.

5145
02:34:40,330 --> 02:34:41,200
They don't take the joint.

5146
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:44,240
It would asshole fat stoner.

5147
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:44,711
Yeah.

5148
02:34:44,711 --> 02:34:47,660
What was the news that obama was a star?

5149
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:48,701
He was an asshole.

5150
02:34:48,701 --> 02:34:49,534
Stoner.

5151
02:34:49,750 --> 02:34:50,291
Yeah.

5152
02:34:50,291 --> 02:34:50,560
I mean,

5153
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:52,270
unless everybody's already high.

5154
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:53,590
And it's just funny.

5155
02:34:53,690 --> 02:34:54,523
It's kind of funny.

5156
02:34:55,650 --> 02:34:56,580
It could be an inside job.

5157
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:59,310
If everybody's already baked
and you just pointlessly court.

5158
02:34:59,311 --> 02:35:01,150
He's the guy always buying the weed,

5159
02:35:01,151 --> 02:35:01,511
you know,

5160
02:35:01,511 --> 02:35:02,100
and it's like,

5161
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:02,920
I'm a heavyweight,

5162
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:03,940
I'm going to buy the weed.

5163
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:04,420
So,

5164
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:09,420
or it can be a selfish dick asshole
power broker who's murdering people as a

5165
02:35:09,590 --> 02:35:10,960
president of the United States.

5166
02:35:12,310 --> 02:35:16,360
It was a strange time when obama won
the nobel peace prize and then they sent

5167
02:35:16,361 --> 02:35:18,280
30,000 more people to Afghanistan,

5168
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:19,540
like a boiler

5169
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:23,333
change.

5170
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:24,400
It was so strange.

5171
02:35:24,401 --> 02:35:24,850
It was like,

5172
02:35:24,850 --> 02:35:25,480
wow,

5173
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:27,460
this is the part in the
movie where you got go,

5174
02:35:27,461 --> 02:35:28,600
what the fuck?

5175
02:35:28,730 --> 02:35:29,000
You know,

5176
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:32,440
this is a part of the movie to watch,

5177
02:35:32,441 --> 02:35:34,300
but it's like an episode of a giant,

5178
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:38,020
giant episode of the watchman if like
they continued to make the series.

5179
02:35:38,021 --> 02:35:38,561
Did you see the,

5180
02:35:38,561 --> 02:35:39,250
uh,

5181
02:35:39,250 --> 02:35:40,083
the watchman?

5182
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:41,170
You don't watch any moviEs,

5183
02:35:41,171 --> 02:35:42,004
man.

5184
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:43,130
You know what?

5185
02:35:43,130 --> 02:35:44,650
It moved from the cultural loop.

5186
02:35:45,030 --> 02:35:46,030
What do you make it fun?

5187
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:48,160
I watched documentaries.

5188
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:49,450
That's where you get your fun.

5189
02:35:49,570 --> 02:35:50,260
Really.

5190
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:50,621
Like I said,

5191
02:35:50,621 --> 02:35:51,430
I go to the gym,

5192
02:35:51,430 --> 02:35:51,731
I go to,

5193
02:35:51,731 --> 02:35:52,600
I go to mma,

5194
02:35:52,630 --> 02:35:53,020
that's fine.

5195
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:53,980
I run with my dog,

5196
02:35:54,010 --> 02:35:54,431
I go,

5197
02:35:54,431 --> 02:35:55,264
I go to wholefoods,

5198
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:56,950
I go to target when I need to,

5199
02:35:57,190 --> 02:35:58,690
and I'm in my apartment.

5200
02:35:58,691 --> 02:35:59,590
I'm a total homebody.

5201
02:35:59,890 --> 02:36:03,130
And you just working constantly
making videos in the prize.

5202
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:04,473
Yeah,

5203
02:36:04,870 --> 02:36:05,703
that's good man.

5204
02:36:05,710 --> 02:36:07,380
but kind of have some fun in this life.

5205
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:08,233
It is,

5206
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:09,370
is.

5207
02:36:09,370 --> 02:36:10,290
Do you ever go to olive garden?

5208
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:11,621
Know brian,

5209
02:36:11,621 --> 02:36:12,041
you kid to,

5210
02:36:12,041 --> 02:36:13,930
to all gardenIng in one episode.

5211
02:36:13,931 --> 02:36:15,250
You're overdoing yourself.

5212
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:17,830
You're becoming a parody
of your own creation.

5213
02:36:18,010 --> 02:36:18,843
Stop it.

5214
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:21,640
Stop before you ruin this
fucking beautiful show.

5215
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:22,830
Um,

5216
02:36:22,830 --> 02:36:24,610
I'm totally not disagreeing
with you by the way.

5217
02:36:24,611 --> 02:36:25,630
When we talked about anything,

5218
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:26,500
It's just I just,

5219
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:26,670
uh,

5220
02:36:26,670 --> 02:36:29,950
I'm a devil's advocate sort of a guy
and I think the effort explore whenever

5221
02:36:29,951 --> 02:36:31,180
someone gives me absolute,

5222
02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:32,410
that's when I automatically go,

5223
02:36:32,470 --> 02:36:32,700
oh,

5224
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:33,370
what about this?

5225
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:34,203
And it's not that I'm,

5226
02:36:34,270 --> 02:36:34,720
you know,

5227
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:36,400
and people will argue with
me on twitter and I'm like,

5228
02:36:36,401 --> 02:36:37,230
I agree with you too.

5229
02:36:37,230 --> 02:36:37,680
I'm not,

5230
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:38,330
I'm not,

5231
02:36:38,330 --> 02:36:43,330
I'm not committed to any version of
the future that I think is going to be

5232
02:36:43,810 --> 02:36:44,500
optimum,

5233
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:48,340
but I'm not averse to the idea that
someone could be in a position where they

5234
02:36:48,341 --> 02:36:52,570
could benevolently guide people instead
of the idea of run us like a government,

5235
02:36:52,870 --> 02:36:53,321
you know,

5236
02:36:53,321 --> 02:36:57,370
and be able to be involved in some sort
of fucking crazy gun running scheme and

5237
02:36:57,580 --> 02:37:00,850
evoke executive privilege where you
don't have to talk about the crazy gun

5238
02:37:00,851 --> 02:37:05,290
running scheme that they sold guns to
mexican drug dealers and one of them

5239
02:37:05,291 --> 02:37:06,490
killed the us federal agent.

5240
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:07,690
You don't have to talk about that.

5241
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:10,570
Not in my vision of what's possible.

5242
02:37:10,571 --> 02:37:12,910
I think you have to be accountable
for all your information.

5243
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:16,580
You have to be accountable for all
your duties and it should be a place of

5244
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:17,301
benevolence.

5245
02:37:17,301 --> 02:37:18,350
I don't think that's possible,

5246
02:37:18,351 --> 02:37:22,010
man with technology too is
happening with your podcast.

5247
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:23,330
I'm sure it's happening with this pot.

5248
02:37:23,410 --> 02:37:23,570
No,

5249
02:37:23,570 --> 02:37:23,681
no,

5250
02:37:23,681 --> 02:37:23,811
no,

5251
02:37:23,811 --> 02:37:23,931
no.

5252
02:37:23,931 --> 02:37:27,080
I mean in a real simple mechanical sense,

5253
02:37:27,081 --> 02:37:28,760
the way that technology is empowering,

5254
02:37:28,970 --> 02:37:29,241
you know,

5255
02:37:29,241 --> 02:37:30,140
google glasses,

5256
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:33,470
pretty soon we're going to have facial
recognition embedded in contact lenses.

5257
02:37:33,471 --> 02:37:33,950
Right?

5258
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:36,710
And to the extent that you want
to make your information public,

5259
02:37:36,940 --> 02:37:40,350
you'll people will be able to scan your
face and see your reputation and it'll

5260
02:37:40,370 --> 02:37:40,880
be your rep.

5261
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:42,710
There'll be some way of
accounting for your reputation,

5262
02:37:42,711 --> 02:37:44,510
be allegedly that pops up.

5263
02:37:44,511 --> 02:37:47,440
If people want to see that
your yelp score stars,

5264
02:37:47,950 --> 02:37:51,050
you're going to be able to like we're
all in that laser thing that they have at

5265
02:37:51,051 --> 02:37:54,800
the tsa agents checkpoints now where
they shoot the laser and read all your

5266
02:37:54,801 --> 02:37:55,430
shit.

5267
02:37:55,430 --> 02:37:57,590
You're going to have that
embedded in your glasses.

5268
02:37:57,591 --> 02:38:00,620
It's all going to be a part of
this system of accountability.

5269
02:38:00,621 --> 02:38:04,700
And it's weird because you know everybody
should be uncomfortable about how

5270
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:06,050
privacy is going away,

5271
02:38:06,051 --> 02:38:06,920
but if anything,

5272
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:11,240
you get the government out of it and you
decide what your level of invasiveness

5273
02:38:11,241 --> 02:38:11,540
is.

5274
02:38:11,540 --> 02:38:13,700
And that's what's so cool
about this technology,

5275
02:38:13,701 --> 02:38:17,360
empowering people to do things that we
think we need government for that we

5276
02:38:17,361 --> 02:38:18,170
really don't.

5277
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:21,050
And it's now with the technology
as superfluous as it is,

5278
02:38:21,230 --> 02:38:21,541
it's,

5279
02:38:21,541 --> 02:38:21,661
it's,

5280
02:38:21,661 --> 02:38:22,640
it's easy to see it.

5281
02:38:22,641 --> 02:38:23,660
You can see it coming.

5282
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:24,351
I see What you're saying.

5283
02:38:24,351 --> 02:38:27,680
what you're saying is that people are
going to have to act together and instead

5284
02:38:27,681 --> 02:38:30,410
of government they're going to have to
form some sort of a sense of community.

5285
02:38:30,740 --> 02:38:32,990
It's just really hard to do that
when the numbers are so big.

5286
02:38:33,230 --> 02:38:37,250
We're just not designed to deal and be
able to manage hundreds of millions of

5287
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:39,920
people when one person
is in charge of that,

5288
02:38:39,921 --> 02:38:41,150
it's almost ridicuLous.

5289
02:38:41,151 --> 02:38:41,271
Well,

5290
02:38:41,271 --> 02:38:42,410
who's in charge of the internet?

5291
02:38:42,411 --> 02:38:43,610
You know that's the high though.

5292
02:38:43,611 --> 02:38:44,510
That's where it's happening.

5293
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:45,361
That's what's beautiful,

5294
02:38:45,361 --> 02:38:48,620
but the internet paradigm is shifting
right now at least can't really make

5295
02:38:48,621 --> 02:38:49,700
physical things.

5296
02:38:49,850 --> 02:38:50,350
You know,

5297
02:38:50,350 --> 02:38:53,870
a manifest themselves as easily
as a group of people can.

5298
02:38:53,960 --> 02:38:54,081
Well,

5299
02:38:54,081 --> 02:38:55,790
our civil disobedience beach party,

5300
02:38:55,791 --> 02:38:58,550
that was a group of people breaking laws
and standing up to the man the other

5301
02:38:58,551 --> 02:39:02,030
day happened on 24 hour notice because
I got a facebook and a twitter account.

5302
02:39:02,450 --> 02:39:03,200
Right?

5303
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:05,100
Well you dug holes and

5304
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:07,573
start.

5305
02:39:07,650 --> 02:39:08,510
it's a start.

5306
02:39:08,511 --> 02:39:12,680
We're working on the tax revolt for
when obamacare is fully implemented.

5307
02:39:12,681 --> 02:39:12,941
You know,

5308
02:39:12,941 --> 02:39:13,774
but like this is,

5309
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:17,420
this is how you start is by
celebrating civil disobedience.

5310
02:39:17,430 --> 02:39:20,540
And second is the
conversations that you've,

5311
02:39:20,541 --> 02:39:20,870
um,

5312
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:23,960
you started on this podcast
and the topics that you,

5313
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:25,760
you're so passionate about.

5314
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:29,720
This is really how it starts because now
there's some dude right now that is on

5315
02:39:29,721 --> 02:39:30,230
the train,

5316
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:34,220
on his way to work and he listens to this
podcast every day and these ideas are

5317
02:39:34,221 --> 02:39:39,170
imprinting in his head and they're
helping him or influencing him in his

5318
02:39:39,171 --> 02:39:40,940
decision and what he's
going to do witH his future.

5319
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:44,450
And that's where I think
everything is starting.

5320
02:39:44,451 --> 02:39:45,740
I think everything right now,

5321
02:39:45,770 --> 02:39:50,510
what we're seeing as far as the changing
of the world is nothing compared to the

5322
02:39:50,511 --> 02:39:55,370
people that are growing up with
the internet from baby to grown up.

5323
02:39:55,371 --> 02:39:56,810
Because that's a totally different.

5324
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:58,700
They're not gonna.

5325
02:39:58,700 --> 02:40:00,740
You're not gonna be able to
sell them donald rumsfeld.

5326
02:40:00,741 --> 02:40:01,480
Bullshit.

5327
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:04,130
You're not gonna be able to sell
though dewey decimal system,

5328
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:05,031
horse shit.

5329
02:40:05,031 --> 02:40:05,390
no.

5330
02:40:05,390 --> 02:40:08,000
They're going to google
and know on a fucking note,

5331
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:08,990
it looks like a laptop,

5332
02:40:08,991 --> 02:40:10,160
but it fits in your pocket.

5333
02:40:10,510 --> 02:40:12,020
You can fucking say,

5334
02:40:12,021 --> 02:40:12,231
man,

5335
02:40:12,231 --> 02:40:15,180
these other kids that are their teachers
and calling them on their bullshit

5336
02:40:15,181 --> 02:40:15,630
because they,

5337
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:15,900
they,

5338
02:40:15,900 --> 02:40:18,750
they know that public schools are
government run indoctrination centers.

5339
02:40:18,751 --> 02:40:18,991
You know,

5340
02:40:18,991 --> 02:40:19,800
you saw that,

5341
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:20,640
that made headlInes.

5342
02:40:20,641 --> 02:40:23,490
Ignore all those schools are just
cheap as fuck as what they are.

5343
02:40:23,491 --> 02:40:25,220
They have no money and everybody suck.

5344
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:26,790
What is the purpose they
serve to government,

5345
02:40:26,791 --> 02:40:27,031
man?

5346
02:40:27,031 --> 02:40:27,151
No,

5347
02:40:27,151 --> 02:40:27,811
it's more than that.

5348
02:40:27,811 --> 02:40:29,820
There's a reason government
has taken over education.

5349
02:40:29,821 --> 02:40:30,000
It's.

5350
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,350
This is the dumbing down.

5351
02:40:31,590 --> 02:40:34,200
You look at the federal department
of education instituted like what?

5352
02:40:34,201 --> 02:40:34,441
Forty,

5353
02:40:34,441 --> 02:40:39,300
50 years ago when we were at or near the
top of every international educational

5354
02:40:39,301 --> 02:40:40,230
ranking system.

5355
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:41,540
Now we're down like 30,

5356
02:40:41,570 --> 02:40:42,150
40.

5357
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:43,710
It's not by accident.

5358
02:40:43,711 --> 02:40:44,640
It's by design.

5359
02:40:44,820 --> 02:40:47,340
What I've seen to be dumbed down
and not question government.

5360
02:40:47,341 --> 02:40:50,190
They want to control the curriculum so
you don't learn about topics like what

5361
02:40:50,191 --> 02:40:51,001
we're talking about now.

5362
02:40:51,001 --> 02:40:52,710
This is why they don't teach real history.

5363
02:40:52,711 --> 02:40:52,990
They've been.

5364
02:40:52,990 --> 02:40:54,000
Who is thinking,

5365
02:40:54,030 --> 02:40:54,421
man,

5366
02:40:54,421 --> 02:40:55,470
this is the real problem with that.

5367
02:40:55,471 --> 02:40:56,790
I think it's more incompetent.

5368
02:40:58,010 --> 02:40:58,200
No,

5369
02:40:58,200 --> 02:40:58,620
you're right.

5370
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:00,990
No incontinent product of the paradigm.

5371
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:05,190
People don't benefit and profit
from making the schools better,

5372
02:41:05,191 --> 02:41:06,840
so it's easy to keep them suppressed.

5373
02:41:06,990 --> 02:41:10,500
It's not that there's some sort of a
strategy to try to keep people stupid.

5374
02:41:10,680 --> 02:41:13,230
It's that there's no money to
be made for making people smart.

5375
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:15,350
So why should they try
so they don't trust.

5376
02:41:15,351 --> 02:41:16,320
So tHe underfunded schools,

5377
02:41:16,330 --> 02:41:17,340
so when things get cut,

5378
02:41:17,490 --> 02:41:19,770
cut the fucking teachers
pay for fuck math suck.

5379
02:41:19,771 --> 02:41:21,080
My dick cut her pay.

5380
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:22,500
So that's what we need
to balance the budget,

5381
02:41:22,501 --> 02:41:23,070
which we do.

5382
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:26,130
Cut the school no more wrestling
and that's where it's coming from.

5383
02:41:26,131 --> 02:41:29,670
It's not coming from some fucking
grand poobah plot with as much assholes

5384
02:41:29,790 --> 02:41:31,950
standing in the middle of
a field burning in effigy,

5385
02:41:31,951 --> 02:41:33,570
deciding how people stupid,

5386
02:41:33,970 --> 02:41:34,600
incompetent.

5387
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:37,350
It's incompetent conspiracy.

5388
02:41:37,351 --> 02:41:38,600
What can be described by incumbents?

5389
02:41:38,601 --> 02:41:38,851
Comments?

5390
02:41:38,851 --> 02:41:39,720
I learned that from work,

5391
02:41:39,721 --> 02:41:40,491
especially with government,

5392
02:41:40,491 --> 02:41:41,490
government workers,

5393
02:41:41,491 --> 02:41:42,000
right?

5394
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,320
Government fucking workers.

5395
02:41:43,321 --> 02:41:43,920
That's the.

5396
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:46,290
That is the tap out job of all time.

5397
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:46,651
you're like,

5398
02:41:46,651 --> 02:41:46,920
I'm not.

5399
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:47,880
I got no ambition,

5400
02:41:47,881 --> 02:41:48,151
man.

5401
02:41:48,151 --> 02:41:49,920
You know what I gotta do you
know what you want me to do?

5402
02:41:50,310 --> 02:41:52,080
This is the reason and
it's not by accident.

5403
02:41:52,081 --> 02:41:57,000
The first thing they cut from the
curriculum is your ability to see what is

5404
02:41:57,001 --> 02:41:57,834
happening.

5405
02:41:58,320 --> 02:41:59,153
What is that?

5406
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:00,053
What's going to help you?

5407
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:01,690
They don't shit teachers to folks.

5408
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:02,380
They don't teach.

5409
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:02,940
They don't teach.

5410
02:42:02,940 --> 02:42:03,773
Well the august,

5411
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:05,520
they don't teach cIvics anymore.

5412
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:07,680
He put you in a room with a teenage kid.

5413
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:08,670
That's a nice guy.

5414
02:42:08,850 --> 02:42:09,540
And uh,

5415
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:12,060
when a water put you in
a room and a teenage kid,

5416
02:42:12,061 --> 02:42:13,630
that's a nice guy and he lets test,

5417
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:15,600
tells you to go to all
his favorite websites.

5418
02:42:15,780 --> 02:42:18,140
Can you guys just go to websites
all day and you learn shit?

5419
02:42:18,141 --> 02:42:19,020
Now look at the cnn.

5420
02:42:19,021 --> 02:42:19,411
Look at this.

5421
02:42:19,411 --> 02:42:20,430
This is a story right here.

5422
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:22,140
This is how the egyptian
god got in government.

5423
02:42:22,270 --> 02:42:24,330
I hear this now you go
like this and you find out.

5424
02:42:24,331 --> 02:42:27,390
Well they were actually worse off with
the new government in Egypt because

5425
02:42:27,391 --> 02:42:28,400
they're even more crazy.

5426
02:42:28,430 --> 02:42:29,670
The muslim brotherhood.

5427
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:30,541
Oh shit.

5428
02:42:30,541 --> 02:42:34,650
I mean you can get more education and
have a couple of hours with a curious

5429
02:42:34,651 --> 02:42:37,350
person and a computer then you
can out of most school day.

5430
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:37,510
Well,

5431
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:40,590
this is one of the things that that's
happening in America right now.

5432
02:42:40,591 --> 02:42:44,910
This will we call the libertarian mind
melt and It's kind of a phenomenon we see

5433
02:42:44,911 --> 02:42:45,870
people going through.

5434
02:42:46,470 --> 02:42:47,251
We used to joke like,

5435
02:42:47,251 --> 02:42:49,620
what's the dIfference between a
minnaar kissed and an anarchist?

5436
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:50,160
You know,

5437
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:54,510
someone who kissed someone who
believes in government limited to the

5438
02:42:54,511 --> 02:42:56,520
constitution or to specific principles,

5439
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:56,941
you know,

5440
02:42:56,941 --> 02:43:00,270
the government should only be used for
this or that as opposed to really we

5441
02:43:00,271 --> 02:43:02,400
should evolve past government
and that expression.

5442
02:43:02,401 --> 02:43:03,190
A menard kissed.

5443
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:03,940
How are you spelling it?

5444
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:04,400
Am I on?

5445
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:05,280
I'm on invest.

5446
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:05,840
Minimal.

5447
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:06,673
That's exactly.

5448
02:43:07,170 --> 02:43:09,720
And ron paul is often
confused as them in our case,

5449
02:43:09,721 --> 02:43:09,901
you know,

5450
02:43:09,901 --> 02:43:10,150
he's,

5451
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:10,410
he,

5452
02:43:10,410 --> 02:43:11,980
he presents a monarch is

5453
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,640
platform as an immediate
practical transition of going
back to the constitution

5454
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:17,500
or at least getting government
restrained to what it's,

5455
02:43:17,610 --> 02:43:17,870
you know,

5456
02:43:17,870 --> 02:43:19,960
legally authorized to do supposedly.

5457
02:43:20,430 --> 02:43:21,730
And his,

5458
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:23,680
his end goal though is
a volunteer society.

5459
02:43:23,681 --> 02:43:25,570
And when I interviewed him for my tv show,

5460
02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:28,190
we talked about this and he
says that he is a volunteer.

5461
02:43:28,191 --> 02:43:30,100
It's all human interaction
should be free of force,

5462
02:43:30,101 --> 02:43:30,861
fraud and coercion.

5463
02:43:30,861 --> 02:43:31,510
And when,

5464
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:31,760
when,

5465
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:32,890
when you really get that,

5466
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:33,571
you know you're,

5467
02:43:33,571 --> 02:43:35,290
you're okay saying I don't know,

5468
02:43:35,540 --> 02:43:38,510
when you look to the future
and you're okay saying law,

5469
02:43:38,630 --> 02:43:39,940
when we don't have slavery,

5470
02:43:39,941 --> 02:43:41,530
I don't know who's going to pick the con.

5471
02:43:41,531 --> 02:43:46,531
I don't know if we're going to have big
machines that do that are going to pick,

5472
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:51,910
pick the cotton for us and then spit out
t shirts like we don't know how that's

5473
02:43:51,911 --> 02:43:53,350
gonna happen and who's
going to build the roads.

5474
02:43:53,350 --> 02:43:56,410
We don't know what's the exact system
that the market is going to be able to do.

5475
02:43:56,411 --> 02:43:57,160
Who's going to do it?

5476
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:58,000
People are going to do it.

5477
02:43:58,001 --> 02:43:58,930
People are gonna do it peacefully.

5478
02:43:58,931 --> 02:44:03,590
And when you understand that government
is not going to be potholes everywhere

5479
02:44:03,591 --> 02:44:06,280
and nothing is ever going
to get to that part,

5480
02:44:06,281 --> 02:44:07,150
lazy bitches,

5481
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:10,320
they're gonna show up late half ass day.

5482
02:44:10,330 --> 02:44:12,520
The hospital's going to smell
like armpits and listen man,

5483
02:44:12,521 --> 02:44:12,820
I don't know.

5484
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:13,930
People are ready for that yet.

5485
02:44:13,990 --> 02:44:14,980
I see what you're saying.

5486
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:16,420
we both want improvement.

5487
02:44:16,421 --> 02:44:17,254
I see whaT you're saying.

5488
02:44:17,260 --> 02:44:18,760
I don't know if I'm
married your system though,

5489
02:44:18,761 --> 02:44:19,480
man.

5490
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:21,200
I don't know if I'm married
to this crazy people.

5491
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:22,030
People use,

5492
02:44:22,030 --> 02:44:23,410
people will go system,

5493
02:44:23,530 --> 02:44:24,030
people are,

5494
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:24,250
are,

5495
02:44:24,250 --> 02:44:26,470
are going through this
and and in the course of.

5496
02:44:26,471 --> 02:44:26,940
I mean we've,

5497
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:28,260
we've been talking for a few hours.

5498
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:29,470
Then of course if a conversation,

5499
02:44:29,710 --> 02:44:32,560
it's very hard for someone
to really shed their,

5500
02:44:32,561 --> 02:44:35,950
their attachment to violence
because that's what it is.

5501
02:44:35,950 --> 02:44:39,310
YOu have an comparing violence though the
government doesn't necessarily have to

5502
02:44:39,311 --> 02:44:41,590
be violent if it evolves
in the council 10 minutes,

5503
02:44:41,591 --> 02:44:45,190
you just got the 10 minute warning at
three hours are fucking thing becomes a

5504
02:44:45,191 --> 02:44:45,970
pumpkin.

5505
02:44:45,970 --> 02:44:46,380
Oh,

5506
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:46,930
we're done.

5507
02:44:46,930 --> 02:44:48,610
Well that's the definition
will of government.

5508
02:44:48,611 --> 02:44:49,810
It's all backed up by force,

5509
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:53,440
but I know that that is an option,

5510
02:44:53,470 --> 02:44:57,490
but I don't necessarily believe that the
idea is that everything you're doing,

5511
02:44:57,491 --> 02:44:59,370
you're doing the threat of violence,

5512
02:44:59,371 --> 02:45:01,810
so we're just using different terms of
threat of violence is only there for

5513
02:45:01,811 --> 02:45:04,450
people that don't want to subscribe
to the standards of the community.

5514
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:05,620
I'm doing whAt I'm saying.

5515
02:45:05,621 --> 02:45:09,400
I'm defining government as the
use of violence in that sense.

5516
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:10,031
So you're just,

5517
02:45:10,031 --> 02:45:10,391
you're just,

5518
02:45:10,391 --> 02:45:12,440
you just have a broader
sense of what government is.

5519
02:45:12,460 --> 02:45:13,600
Only the use of violence.

5520
02:45:13,601 --> 02:45:14,710
If things go wrong,

5521
02:45:14,890 --> 02:45:18,460
it's not the use of violence or if
someone disagrees with the majority,

5522
02:45:18,470 --> 02:45:19,570
that's just shit cops.

5523
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:22,630
It's just shit that anybody who
doesn't want to pay for wars,

5524
02:45:22,850 --> 02:45:25,300
you can protest all you want as
long as you keep paying your taxes,

5525
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:26,320
they'll still be a war.

5526
02:45:27,130 --> 02:45:27,850
Right?

5527
02:45:27,850 --> 02:45:29,770
I see what you're saying that your
money's going to go to that anyway.

5528
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:33,400
But what would be a beautiful thing if
you were able to vote whether or not your

5529
02:45:33,401 --> 02:45:34,234
money went to the war,

5530
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:34,870
boy,

5531
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:38,980
would award be different than if you could
like check off of what someone should

5532
02:45:38,981 --> 02:45:42,910
introduce that they should say you get
to vote whether or not any of your tax

5533
02:45:42,911 --> 02:45:44,550
dollars ever get you anything.

5534
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:46,540
Military has to be road worldwide.

5535
02:45:46,541 --> 02:45:46,871
Yep.

5536
02:45:46,871 --> 02:45:47,441
And you'd be like,

5537
02:45:47,441 --> 02:45:48,460
fuck you.

5538
02:45:48,580 --> 02:45:52,980
If you could actually decide
to pay less taxes or more tags.

5539
02:45:53,650 --> 02:45:54,550
What I'm advocating,

5540
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:58,970
that's exactly what I'm advocating in war.

5541
02:45:59,470 --> 02:46:01,000
The wars would be really small,

5542
02:46:01,001 --> 02:46:04,720
just like cold up fights between
a couple of extra dollar.

5543
02:46:04,721 --> 02:46:05,950
Just so keep me safe.

5544
02:46:06,170 --> 02:46:06,720
ExactlY.

5545
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:07,553
Be free,

5546
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:10,340
free to watch people drive

5547
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:11,780
around in a circle.

5548
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:14,300
Listen,

5549
02:46:14,300 --> 02:46:15,111
ladies and gentlemen,

5550
02:46:15,111 --> 02:46:16,130
we're going to get through this.

5551
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:20,450
I don't know if it's going to be the adam
call cash model or if it's going to be

5552
02:46:20,451 --> 02:46:23,150
the terence mckenna mayan apocalypse,

5553
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:25,100
2012 model.

5554
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:26,590
I don't know what the
fuck's going to happen,

5555
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:27,630
but we're going to get through this too.

5556
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:27,920
Man.

5557
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:28,940
I feel really bad now.

5558
02:46:28,941 --> 02:46:32,720
I spent time answering your questions
and talking about why do that.

5559
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:33,350
I always,

5560
02:46:33,350 --> 02:46:34,460
because I wanted to ask you,

5561
02:46:34,461 --> 02:46:34,880
I wanted.

5562
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:35,711
I wanted you to.

5563
02:46:35,711 --> 02:46:40,460
I want to get Your your mentorship and
tap your wisdom and see about what you

5564
02:46:40,461 --> 02:46:42,990
think I should be doing differently
because you're not listening to anything

5565
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:44,030
that you're doing what you want to do,

5566
02:46:44,031 --> 02:46:46,070
and I think what you want
to do is educate people,

5567
02:46:46,071 --> 02:46:46,904
enlightened people,

5568
02:46:47,210 --> 02:46:48,590
express information,

5569
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:50,270
and I think that's a beautiful thing.

5570
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:51,380
That's why you're so happy.

5571
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:53,750
You're happy because you're
genuinely doing good things.

5572
02:46:53,751 --> 02:46:57,080
You're happy because you're genuinely
affecting people in a positive way.

5573
02:46:57,290 --> 02:47:00,980
You're putting out a positive blast
of energy and information and allowing

5574
02:47:00,981 --> 02:47:03,730
people to empower their thoughts
and allow people to realize that,

5575
02:47:03,731 --> 02:47:04,011
hey man,

5576
02:47:04,011 --> 02:47:04,850
I'm not crazy.

5577
02:47:04,851 --> 02:47:05,780
I'm a nice person.

5578
02:47:05,781 --> 02:47:07,040
There's other people like that out there.

5579
02:47:07,041 --> 02:47:10,790
There's other people that believe
in truth and what real liberty is.

5580
02:47:10,940 --> 02:47:14,120
Liberty is having the liberty to do
what you want and we're not affecting

5581
02:47:14,121 --> 02:47:14,690
people.

5582
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:18,200
Having the ability to roam
anywhere unrestricted.

5583
02:47:18,201 --> 02:47:22,100
You don't have to be fucked
with by someone that is
just there because there's a

5584
02:47:22,101 --> 02:47:24,580
job opening and that job
opening is controlled.

5585
02:47:24,581 --> 02:47:27,050
People enforce this shit that's
written down on this piece of paper,

5586
02:47:27,290 --> 02:47:28,340
so you're doing great already.

5587
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:28,581
Well,

5588
02:47:28,581 --> 02:47:29,420
that's exactly what talking.

5589
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:30,260
Keep.

5590
02:47:30,260 --> 02:47:31,760
Keep on doing what you're doing,

5591
02:47:31,761 --> 02:47:32,031
man.

5592
02:47:32,031 --> 02:47:32,864
Just do what you're doing.

5593
02:47:32,910 --> 02:47:34,730
That's what I'm going to do
and that's what brian does.

5594
02:47:35,060 --> 02:47:36,350
We know what the right thing to do is,

5595
02:47:36,351 --> 02:47:36,501
man,

5596
02:47:36,501 --> 02:47:38,900
we all have an internal compass
is telling you what to do.

5597
02:47:39,110 --> 02:47:42,380
She's got to figure out a way to avoid
all the pitfalls in life that can keep

5598
02:47:42,381 --> 02:47:45,080
you from accomplishing that
are going in that direction.

5599
02:47:45,440 --> 02:47:46,460
Everybody's is different.

5600
02:47:46,461 --> 02:47:47,300
You just got to find it.

5601
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:48,800
You dirty bitches.

5602
02:47:48,801 --> 02:47:51,050
This is not a fucking self help show.

5603
02:47:52,150 --> 02:47:53,270
What have you done to debate?

5604
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:53,690
Do.

5605
02:47:53,690 --> 02:47:54,381
Thank you very much.

5606
02:47:54,381 --> 02:47:56,600
We talked about masturbating
for like an hour an hour.

5607
02:47:56,630 --> 02:47:57,160
Well,

5608
02:47:57,160 --> 02:47:57,590
that's,

5609
02:47:57,590 --> 02:48:01,070
that's a good amount of time to take off
if you ever want to come back and do it

5610
02:48:01,071 --> 02:48:01,251
again,

5611
02:48:01,251 --> 02:48:01,401
man.

5612
02:48:01,401 --> 02:48:02,000
Let's do it again.

5613
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:02,781
Do it again in the future.

5614
02:48:02,781 --> 02:48:03,500
If you're ever in la,

5615
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:04,120
les again,

5616
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,540
and now that you're a
legal medical patients,

5617
02:48:06,790 --> 02:48:08,620
I'm sure you have to come
back and get medicated.

5618

02:49:06,191 --> 02:49:08,370
A few more tickets left in thursday.

5652
02:49:08,371 --> 02:49:09,450
There's a few more tickets left.

5653
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:11,190
So there's more than one show on friday.

5654
02:49:11,250 --> 02:49:11,431
Yeah,

5655
02:49:11,431 --> 02:49:12,031
there's two shows.

5656
02:49:12,031 --> 02:49:12,864
What time of day?

5657
02:49:13,010 --> 02:49:15,690
I think 8:30 and 10:30.

5658
02:49:15,750 --> 02:49:18,120
I got two shows friday in san diego.

5659
02:49:18,121 --> 02:49:19,880
Last gentleman's comedy company,

5660
02:49:19,910 --> 02:49:20,880
one of them's already sold out.

5661
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:21,831
So come on down.

5662
02:49:21,831 --> 02:49:22,501
You dirty freaks.

5663
02:49:22,501 --> 02:49:25,440
This is my first experience at comic con
and if you're listening to New Jersey,

5664
02:49:25,441 --> 02:49:29,370
we have another civil
disobedience swimsuit protests
on the boardwalk in asbury

5665
02:49:29,371 --> 02:49:30,420
park this saturday,

5666
02:49:30,421 --> 02:49:31,380
July 14th.

5667
02:49:31,440 --> 02:49:33,000
You're not allowed to wear
swimsuits on the boardwalk.

5668
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:34,640
It's punishable by a thousand dollars.

5669
02:49:34,650 --> 02:49:36,000
Five days in jail.

5670
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:39,630
What kind of content is this?

5671
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:43,440
We're standing up to the man that is
not a cop that is a glorified revenue

5672
02:49:43,441 --> 02:49:43,921
collector.

5673
02:49:43,921 --> 02:49:47,670
That is sometimes so is that a piss poor
job of managing that fucking community?

5674
02:49:47,670 --> 02:49:50,970
It might be just because they don't want
girls with thongs around little kids

5675
02:49:50,971 --> 02:49:51,804
that are on the pier.

5676
02:49:51,810 --> 02:49:54,700
Why let them learn young to see that?

5677
02:49:54,750 --> 02:49:55,561
Take a good look.

5678
02:49:55,561 --> 02:49:56,394
Right and haven.

5679
02:49:56,870 --> 02:50:01,350
I gotta get one more plug in if I'm to
sperm veterans for ron paul who are so

5680
02:50:01,351 --> 02:50:04,290
inspired like I am by his message
to be on this philosophical journey.

5681
02:50:04,291 --> 02:50:07,380
We're going to be marching
on the rnc in tampa.

5682
02:50:07,381 --> 02:50:08,640
August 27th.

5683
02:50:08,970 --> 02:50:10,100
Be there for paul fez.

5684
02:50:10,770 --> 02:50:11,603
Hold on.

5685
02:50:12,030 --> 02:50:16,350
You just say you're going to march
outside in tampa in fucking august.

5686
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:18,480
Eight miles preposterous.

5687
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:19,651
I was in fallujah.

5688
02:50:19,651 --> 02:50:20,221
What do you expect?

5689
02:50:20,221 --> 02:50:20,821
That's crazy,

5690
02:50:20,821 --> 02:50:21,031
man.

5691
02:50:21,031 --> 02:50:22,080
You got to kill some old people.

5692
02:50:22,081 --> 02:50:24,970
We're going to go salute ron paul because
he's woken so many people up there.

5693
02:50:25,190 --> 02:50:26,060
Drive air,

5694
02:50:26,370 --> 02:50:27,460
air conditioning and shit.

5695
02:50:27,480 --> 02:50:28,860
Maybe we'll wave a flag out the window.

5696
02:50:28,861 --> 02:50:30,630
You can drive and meet us
there just to get a tattoo.

5697
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:31,860
we're going to salute ron paul.

5698
02:50:31,861 --> 02:50:32,990
I'm not walking outside side.

5699
02:50:33,210 --> 02:50:33,601
Listen,

5700
02:50:33,601 --> 02:50:34,360

5701
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:35,700

02:50:37,891 --> 02:50:38,190

5706
02:50:38,190 --> 02:50:38,671
Like I said,

5707
02:50:38,671 --> 02:50:39,121

5708
02:50:39,121 --> 02:50:39,450

02:50:57,841 --> 02:51:01,980
We've got a kat von d and I are in
talks of doing a podcast next week.

5724
02:51:01,981 --> 02:51:03,630

5725
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:04,493
I'll let you know.

5726
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:05,700
We're working that out.

5727
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:08,550
You guys are giving me a hard time for
hitting on the wheat chick on the air.

5728
02:51:08,551 --> 02:51:10,110
You guys are talking to porn stars.

5729
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:10,990
Kat von d's are poor.

5730
02:51:10,990 --> 02:51:12,030
So she's a tattoo artist.

5731
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:12,811
Oh my bad.

5732
02:51:12,811 --> 02:51:13,101
I've been.

5733
02:51:13,101 --> 02:51:14,370
I'm talking about brian earlier.

5734
02:51:15,130 --> 02:51:15,650
What are you talking?

5735
02:51:15,650 --> 02:51:16,320
Oh yeah,

He has.

5738
02:51:17,581 --> 02:51:18,500
He does podcasts with them.

5739
02:51:18,510 --> 02:51:19,500
He's actually doing a podcast.

5740
02:51:19,550 --> 02:51:21,930

02:51:25,591 --> 02:51:26,011
Desk squad.

5744
02:51:26,011 --> 02:51:27,900
That team and solar than me.

5745
02:51:27,990 --> 02:51:28,311
Oh,

5746
02:51:28,311 --> 02:51:30,390
this is nothing cool about that.

5747
02:51:30,391 --> 02:51:31,680
All right folks,

5748
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:33,510
thanks for all the love.

5749
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:37,140
I can't say it any more
succinctly clearly than that.

5750
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:38,100
Thanks for everything.

5751
02:51:38,100 --> 02:51:39,270
Thanks for the twitter messages.

5752
02:51:39,480 --> 02:51:40,800
Thanks for all the positive energy.

5753
02:51:41,010 --> 02:51:43,260
Thanks for basically
being a part of all this.

5754
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:44,640
I don't even know what the fuck this is,

5755
02:51:44,641 --> 02:51:47,700
but something's going down
the love aleutian strap in.

5756
02:51:47,701 --> 02:51:48,534
I don't think it's that.

5757
02:51:49,290 --> 02:51:51,360
I think taking off as a species.

5758
02:51:51,361 --> 02:51:51,811
Get ready.

5759
02:51:51,811 --> 02:51:52,360
Alright man.

5760
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:53,220
Maybe see you.
