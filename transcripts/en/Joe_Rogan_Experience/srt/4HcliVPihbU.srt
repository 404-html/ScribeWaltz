00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,560
Six,
five,

2
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:00,880
four,
three,

3
00:00:00,881 --> 00:00:01,680
two,
one.

4
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:03,150
But

5
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,830
suck it.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,440
I always just want to start off a 
podcast by just saying suck it.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,090
Suck at the Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by [inaudible] dot 

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,210
com.
If you go to o,

9
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,060
n n I t dot Com and enter the code name 
Rogan.

10
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:29,061
You can save yourself 10 percent off any
of our groovy supplements I'm on.

11
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:34,281
It is a company that tries to provide 
you the best supplements and a strength 

12
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:37,560
and fitness and health and nutrition 
stuff available.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,130
Essentially find cool shit online.
Um,

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,230
that the,
that I use in real life that I buy and 

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,870
the best trends in fitness as far as 
like battle ropes and kettle bells.

16
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:51,450
And we have this new thing called a 
steel bill.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,850
It's like a,
it's like,

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,470
oh look a giant fucking sandbag that you
toss around.

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,770
We're just always kind of trying to 
constantly add to our things that we 

20
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,590
make available online.
But it's this one,

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,060
it's called a steel bell.
It's like a,

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,390
it's like a bag filled with like metal 
pellets and you lift it up and fucking 

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,660
throw it around and shit.
Got a video for whatever use you and 

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:17,730
then we,
you know,

25
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,040
we have like um,
medicine balls and shit.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160
I actually just started doing a lot of 
that stuff with medicine ball medicine 

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,740
balls and battle ropes and I've been 
getting into

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,010
a lot of the workouts you would do with 
the,

29
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,880
with the,
um,

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,480
with the one piece bathing suit over 
shoulder and those kind of guys.

31
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,520
One piece bathing suit over your 
shoulder.

32
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,430
Like Oh.
Oh yeah,

33
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:36,820
yeah,
yeah,

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,310
yeah,
yeah.

35
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:40,490
Well it was like a tank top shorts.
Yeah.

36
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:42,480
Like old school,
strong man type shit.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,710
Yeah.
It does seem like it would toss us heavy

38
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,280
ball back and forth for awhile.
Yeah.

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,720
Um,
so any of the shit that

40
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,810
sell is stuff that's been shown to be 
the best for whatever.

41
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:58,700
For strength and fitness for health and 
nutrition.

42
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,500
We're just trying to sell you the 
coolest shit that we can find.

43
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,250
Including killer bee honey,
that's the latest thing.

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,640
I have no idea if it's any better than 
regular bee honey.

45
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:10,641
It's probably not a,
but it's fucking killer bee honey and 

46
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:11,280
this honey.
I'm trying to drink more honey.

47
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,750
Actually,
it's from killer bees in.

48
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,690
It really took killer bees and they 
stole their fucking hunting.

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,910
Have you got checked out already?
Love it.

50
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,010
What's wrong with your throat?
I just lose it a lot.

51
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,130
Like he's been losing his voice a lot 
really.

52
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,940
But I've been taking more care of the 
uh,

53
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,140
but um,
I'd been screaming a lot on stage over 

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,140
the last six months.
Yeah,

55
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,100
a lot more often to customers sets.
Instead of stop screaming my other 

56
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,100
options,
write a joke.

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,090
You could go to o n n I t dot Com.
Get some fucking killer bee honey and 

58
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,240
drink a whole candidate.
Shit.

59
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,730
See if it helps you.
I will see if it gets your pussy ass 

60
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,451
back in line.
I throw a temper tantrum once because 

61
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:50,451
hunting.
What the fuck?

62
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,060
What happened to the girl if you go to 
the other on it.

63
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,040
Oh,
and I take a bank.

64
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,940
Yeah.
He got really

65
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,470
good title company or something.
Other fun words.

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,850
Fuck it.
As a.

67
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,980
we're also brought to you by hover.
Hover.com

68
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,010
is a company that is owned by Ting.
Have basically a one company called two 

69
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,720
cows.
I believe,

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,660
and it's a company that's been around 
since 1994,

71
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:22,220
it's one of the largest domain name 
registers in the world and hovers a part

72
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:26,450
of that and what hover is trying to do 
is make you know,

73
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
just like they did with ting,
try to make you know,

74
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,550
an evil free domain name company.
They don't believe any heady heavy 

75
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:37,190
handed selling or aggressive cross 
selling.

76
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:42,191
They don't bleed and hide and 
functionality or requiring extra 

77
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:45,461
payments for things that should be 
including with domain name management 

78
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,470
like so they just make it really simple 
and easy.

79
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:53,471
They offer 23 top level domains and they
also have it set up so that you can do 

80
00:03:55,851 --> 00:04:00,440
all of this through hover.com,
forward slash Rogan and if you do that,

81
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,950
you save 10 percent off your domain name
registrar.

82
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Can I just add a.
They have a no charge for the who is 

83
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,091
privacy,
which is a big deal because places like 

84
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,790
go daddy and all these other places.
They might have a good rate,

85
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,130
but you're getting.
You're not getting anything extra.

86
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:20,030
That's why when you try to register 
through one of those other companies,

87
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,980
you're going after page after page like,
no,

88
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:22,880
I don't want that.
No,

89
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:23,860
I don't want that,
you know,

90
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,870
I don't want that.
Was this actually gives you a know who 

91
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,630
is privacy with no charge,
which is a,

92
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:34,631
at what I get on all my domains because 
you have to give your real address and 

93
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,440
if you don't,
they,

94
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,380
they,
they will just be like,

95
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,400
all right,
you were taking your domain away from 

96
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,400
you.
And then people write as like,

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,400
as like business.
Yeah.

98
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,710
Whatever.
People who deals with you and like,

99
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:44,870
shut up.
Why don't you have my address?

100
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,760
It's really scary that they make you do 
that.

101
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,630
So what this a company that has hovered 
a,

102
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,460
they give you that no charge the who is 
privacy,

103
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:54,920
which covers that up for you.
It's just says,

104
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,500
you know,
this is registered to blah blah blah.

105
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,810
It's just like a fake thing.
So that's really good deal.

106
00:04:59,811 --> 00:04:59,890
Right?

107
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,800
Actually,
yeah,

108
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,210
that's pretty,
that's pretty slick.

109
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,440
Um,
and it's,

110
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,550
uh,
like I said,

111
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,370
it's the same,
the,

112
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,760
the ethics behind the company,
the same as behind Tang.

113
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,050
There's trying not to rip anybody off 
and you can make a lot of money not 

114
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,050
ripping people off,
you know,

115
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,180
especially people are loyal.
So go,

116
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:19,181
uh,
go check it out and save 10 percent 

117
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,280
hover.com
forward slash rogen 10 percent off your 

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,770
domain name registrations,
aren't you dirty fox?

119
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:26,090
We're here with Ari Shaffir who will be 
joining me Friday,

120
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,080
February first and Mandalay bay.
Oh yeah,

121
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,030
with the Great Joey Diaz at massive fuck
where the waves are.

122
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,950
Cue The music bitch.
Maybe.

123
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,660
There we go.

124
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,320
Sweet.

125
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,450
Heavenly Jesus.
We're back.

126
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,230
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much and welcome aboard.

127
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,630
Powerful Arash fear.
How do you do that stuff?

128
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:02,820
Brian?
Spitting down stuff.

129
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,880
How does he do it?
Yeah,

130
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,850
he's a master at using a fake turntable.
Oh Wow.

131
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,260
That's cool.
I like that.

132
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:17,261
And make them look like turntables to 
instead of just pushing a lever or 

133
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:17,261
something.
Yeah,

134
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:21,981
they're crafty.
These fucks with their ipad technology 

135
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,530
with the things they've done.
We had that Neil degrasse Tyson guy on 

136
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,481
the podcast yesterday.
I've been seen videos on him for a long 

137
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:29,481
time,
so a lot of fun,

138
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:29,970
man.
Really,

139
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,020
really interesting guy.
Yeah.

140
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,870
What an inspirational dude.
Super Cute.

141
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Great response for the podcast.
Except for me talking about the moon 

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,250
landing,
almost universally hated.

143
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,430
Hated.
It was.

144
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,020
I want to just say that it was not my 
idea to talk about that.

145
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,370
That's something that he wanted to talk 
about in advance.

146
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,680
It's sort of alluded to the fact that he
was going to bring that up.

147
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,010
Whoops.
That's my laptop.

148
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,500
The she got mad at Ralph and maybe once 
because were all sitting around like 

149
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:58,800
late night in Vegas or something.
And Ralphie goes,

150
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,660
so tell me about that.
What do you think about the moon landing

151
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:01,780
and the edge of this motherfucker?

152
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,930
What are you going to start it?
Serious thing.

153
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,170
We went into the psychology of a looking
for a hidden things and how fascinating 

154
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:19,620
they are too,
but we're talking about the,

155
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,640
the idea of that if there's a planet 
there somewhere outside of Pluto that 

156
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:27,120
they believe might exist to successful 
theory,

157
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,450
what was he as.
This is a thing called the Kuiper belt 

158
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,330
is a massive amount of asteroids that 
are out there,

159
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,200
but they think it's very possible that 
there's a large planet that's out there,

160
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:42,201
but it's so far away it has no 
reflection of light from the sun and we 

161
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:45,201
can't even see it,
but we're sort of guessing by some of 

162
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:45,600
the things that have gone on in that 
area as far as like a.

163
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,760
He goes,
yeah,

164
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,100
and so we were talking about that and I 
was just commenting on how weird it is 

165
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,961
that we have this desire to find shit 
that's not there when the shit that we 

166
00:07:57,391 --> 00:08:01,110
know is there,
you really haven't looked into it all.

167
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,950
Like I've really not looked into Jupiter
that much.

168
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,980
You know?
I mean I kind of know that it's a gas 

169
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:09,980
giant.
Got The spot on it.

170
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:09,980
Yeah.
It's,

171
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,620
I know that a shoemaker levy hit it,
this comment and blew up and I know that

172
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:15,660
recently they found another common 
impact.

173
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,150
I know like little things,
but like as far as like,

174
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,190
like the real

175
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,490
know as far as like it's a fascinating 
thing and all the information is readily

176
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:30,340
available and right there,
but instead I'm like,

177
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,960
man,
they might be hidden.

178
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:36,400
Planted out there.
The planets that are here,

179
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:38,230
I don't give a fuck about.
I don't even.

180
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm so bored with the moon.
The moon didn't exist.

181
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,400
Then one day above you is a fucking 
Mooney.

182
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:50,401
Be shitting your pants.
You'd be freaking out that the planet 

183
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:51,070
was that close.
Everybody would be going nuts.

184
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,310
You just wouldn't.
People would just be sitting down and 

185
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,310
parks just looking up,
staring that moon.

186
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,070
If it was a new thing,
it was like you'd have four parks filled

187
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,290
with people.
They would come and cities and gather up

188
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,150
and they would try to make sense of 
their.

189
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,170
Yeah,
there's some new thing is invaded their 

190
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,280
atmosphere.
It's floating above their planet.

191
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,020
That would freak people out,
but instead like,

192
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:17,021
oh yeah,
it's the moon because it's always been 

193
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:17,021
there.

194
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:21,420
It's always been there and when 
sometimes you look up and you see like 

195
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,200
Saturn,
you seem like virgin was offering one 

196
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
for 10 grand,
not even a crazy amount,

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,090
like 10 grand.
Would you go for it?

198
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,090
I would have to.
You'd have to be a few years in.

199
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,670
I would have to see it first.
Fuck that.

200
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Because you know someone's not going to 
make it back.

201
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,930
I got a matter of time.
I mean it's like we know it's a matter 

202
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,380
of time with air flight,
you know there's some,

203
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,660
some plane somewhere is going down.
Oh yeah.

204
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,240
Just like some car somewhere is gonna 
crash.

205
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,870
So are you willing to die in space?
That's the real question.

206
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,250
Are you willing to die in space?
That wouldn't be bad at diamond space.

207
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,370
Forget A.
because at least they sort of find your 

208
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:03,370
body like maybe generations,
they're gonna.

209
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,090
It's gonna be a long time because the 
first thing they have to do before they 

210
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,021
do anything is the day after they're 
going to do commercial space flight 

211
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:10,021
where it's just the orbit,
the earth,

212
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,560
so they'll probably do that for a few 
years.

213
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,800
I have stations where people can go to.
Have you seen what the things look like?

214
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,300
They like.
It looks like a plain sort of divergence

215
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,240
ship to use to go into space,
but everyone just has a seat.

216
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,740
Yeah,
I mean you have seats.

217
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:25,180
I don't know how many seats there are on
it.

218
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:30,181
I mean it's.
I'm sure it's more complicated than a 

219
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:33,001
plane,
but it essentially looks like some sort 

220
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,450
of a double a hold plane.
It looks weird.

221
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,910
It doesn't look like a spaceship.
I thought it would look like a spaceship

222
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,040
and you can dock with the.
With the people up there.

223
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,090
Yeah.
I think that's the plan for the future.

224
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:45,490
I don't know if that's what they're 
going to do initially.

225
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,730
I think.
I think there's probably a bunch of 

226
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,641
options on the table.
Just take him out there and then bring 

227
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:53,641
them back.

228
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:53,641
Yeah.
That's a space you got to think.

229
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:56,760
How long can people deal with that?
You know what?

230
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,770
If you're up there with some dude who 
hasn't taken us pack salt and fucking 

231
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,070
blows a gasket,
you got to make a person proof.

232
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,110
Yeah,
you gotta make it person proof.

233
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,780
This would be a lot of good going mad.
Seeing the whole Earth Day.

234
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,340
I'm like,
Oh,

235
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,000
oh,
there's clothing.

236
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,430
No,
God,

237
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:10,450
I've wasted my life.
Well,

238
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:11,670
when you were in,
um,

239
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,850
when you're on a fan,
one of those fighter jets,

240
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,390
they have like a thing under your seat.
Deca pull out and inject yourself and 

241
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,441
you go flying through the air on a 
fucking parachute and you can't have 

242
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:29,530
those space.
You can't have that shit.

243
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,560
You got to make sure that this asshole 
is like,

244
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,810
if this thing's going down,
you don't have any say in it.

245
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,510
You have no control over the buttons.

246
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,750
It is kind of weird that like regular 
flights don't have at least parachutes,

247
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,380
you know,
you'd think that they would.

248
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,690
She's underneath each seat.
You just don't kind of.

249
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,800
And we've got about 10 minutes.
Get everybody out here.

250
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,360
Thank you.
Understand how fast you're growing.

251
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,960
Yeah,
but I mean like a last resort,

252
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,820
you know,
I'd rather have that than a seat cushion

253
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:59,000
I could use as a flotation device.
I'd rather have a parachute as if like,

254
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,230
okay,
this shit's going down.

255
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:02,150
I'm going to try.
I don't know how to use this thing,

256
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:02,990
but I'm just going to try it.

257
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,150
That would make sense.
That would make sense,

258
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:08,840
but you would have to be willing to 
somehow or another open up a window or a

259
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:12,470
door while that fuckers in the air 
stewardess would have to do it for us.

260
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,560
No,
I don't think you understand what 

261
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,871
happens to your body when you're flying 
500 miles an hour and you jump out into 

262
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:22,520
the air.
Like,

263
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,030
dude,
you got down with a trooper.

264
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,520
He said you got knocked out a lot.
Yeah,

265
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,070
you're going to get knocked unconscious.
You're not going to be able to breathe.

266
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,430
You're going 500 miles an hour with your
face and you're still going 500 miles an

267
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:33,940
hour when you jump out.
Okay.

268
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,980
You really have to wrap your head around
that because you're being protected by 

269
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,740
this tube to the point where you're 
completely unaware of the velocity.

270
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,280
You're flying through the fucking air 
when you just get shot through it and 

271
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,640
just let go.
Oh,

272
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,820
and by the way,
if you hit a bird,

273
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:48,120
you can explode.
Yeah,

274
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,340
yeah.
Guess what?

275
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,720
You wouldn't get one for awhile.
Now

276
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,090
the other option is pavement inside of 
it.

277
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,210
Target that you're playing.

278
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,240
That's probably the best way.
That way you know you're done.

279
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,060
You know you don't want to fucking sort 
of survive.

280
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,360
What happens if you.
If everyone was leaving the plane with 

281
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,360
your flotation device,
but you forget yours and it's like,

282
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,050
but you're only like an aisle or two 
ahead of where you started.

283
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Do you have to go back?
Do you think there's any chance people 

284
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,181
will let you back there?
Maybe if he'd scream I needed a 

285
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:14,181
flotation device,
but that's so such a.

286
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:17,790
We needed a name for that stupid thing.
Facilitation of US flotation device,

287
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,590
if she can be used as a flotation 
device,

288
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,000
should be a buoy thing.
A hell have a fucking name,

289
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,580
but we think that there's something with
Latin.

290
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,980
Yeah.
Something should ever fucking name.

291
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,140
Where's my flotation device?
A flotation gives me more life.

292
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,370
Live on the water.
There's the picture of Neil Degrasse 

293
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,280
Tyson discusses simulation theory.
Suspiciously Asian looking person 

294
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:46,240
appears behind it.
What was that?

295
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,370
You.
It's Brian has always said that like 

296
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,470
when you start talking about simulation 
theory in Asia and will show up.

297
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,980
Sounds like French and that to let you 
know that you're.

298
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,910
That.
Yeah,

299
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,550
it is.
It is really all just a simulation.

300
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,520
It was actually somebody that somebody 
photoshop that in.

301
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:03,420
No,

302
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,630
no,
that's actually Mike Brown who was on 

303
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:08,630
that pointless podcast following this,
that he came early.

304
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,050
I met so many photoshop.
The writing.

305
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,610
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

306
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,780
Oh No.

307
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Puppets.
Bigger issue here.

308
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Then the Asian Person Chem trails,
floating leather letters talking about 

309
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:34,920
us.

310
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,910
I'm Mike.
Um,

311
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,030
he said he was like a big time mixmax 
mixing shop.

312
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,740
He was really cool.
He does video mixing.

313
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,700
So instead of doing like deejaying with 
Odey,

314
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,070
he takes video clips and mixes like 
videos and stuff

315
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,720
like that.
Oh yeah,

316
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,100
yeah,
yeah.

317
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,670
Let's throw one out.
What is a.

318
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,080
What is it about a.
let me find tall dicks.

319
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,230
Just dicks going into Dick's and 
splicing.

320
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:05,090
Becoming Celtic.
Dick's to here.

321
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:08,120
We're going to Mars.
People are really.

322
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,820
When was this Dutch people?
Twenty,

323
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,030
20,
19.

324
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,190
Ain't gonna make it or taking volunteers
now.

325
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,250
Well,
that's why Neil Tyson says that's what 

326
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,171
we need.
We need somebody else going to go there 

327
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:20,171
first and that's the only way we'll go 
to Mars.

328
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:20,720
You know,
like let some males pave the way.

329
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,740
I didn't do a good job guys.
That was his reasoning behind the idea 

330
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,550
that,
you know,

331
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:27,980
the,
the,

332
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:31,720
the racist to the moon was won by the 
Americans.

333
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,750
Then it was pretty much over like the 
Russians didn't even want to go to the 

334
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:36,750
moon.
What's the point?

335
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,460
The United States already there.
Here's Mike Relm.

336
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:42,461
He remixes an old spice commercial.
How can I smell like space shows?

337
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,420
That's easy.

338
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,830
I'm going to vote and he has a whole 
bunch of different ones.

339
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,590
Like this one,
you know what kind of stuff,

340
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,310
but I'm not gay,
but very sexy video.

341
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,000
It's really funny.
So confident man with his shirt off,

342
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,950
he's making silly noises with his mouth.
Oh,

343
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Scott Pilgrim.
I don't know if you've ever seen that 

344
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,471
movie.
It was a really great guy having sex 

345
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:35,690
with a girl from behind.
What was the other thumbnail?

346
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,640
I don't know.
Someone's horning.

347
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,920
Hold on.
This is.

348
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,480
I don't know if you saw a whatever it's 
called.

349
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,360
Here it is.
Scott Pilgrim

350
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,690
mixing ludicrous gas and

351
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,560
Oh,
Internet.

352
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,530
Check out his.
The people that people at home that are 

353
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,121
listening or anyone in the car.
This is what he did is he spliced the 

354
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:29,350
Scott Pilgrim movie with the ludicrous 
music video and voices and their know 

355
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,300
how to feel about mashup songs.
Some of them are great.

356
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,490
Yeah,
but it's just had originally you would 

357
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,041
like or it's just the two of them.
Two of them coming together doesn't 

358
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,160
bother me,
but you know what bothered me and I,

359
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,400
I like kid rock at that last kid rock 
song was like a combination of sweet 

360
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:48,930
home Alabama and something else.
You know,

361
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,010
know I spent doing

362
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,890
that a lot lately.
Yeah.

363
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,050
But it's just,
I didn't.

364
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,550
It was like,
man,

365
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,200
this is like,
it feels like.

366
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,680
It's like when vanilla ice was doing ice
ice baby,

367
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,330
it was like under pressure.
Was the rift,

368
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,270
is that under pressure riff?
At least in the mashups.

369
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,290
Like you can clearly tell which songs 
we're using.

370
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,900
We're not trying to say this is our 
stuff like kid rock stuff.

371
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:11,901
You don't know.
I mean I guess as a tribute and you 

372
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:11,901
know,
it was a really popular songs,

373
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:12,720
so what the fuck do I know?
But I'm like man,

374
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,870
I would rather hear the actual songs.
Yeah.

375
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,330
That's how I feel sometimes with the 
mashups sometimes,

376
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,330
but it just feels lame.
Have you ever heard good though?

377
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,390
Voodoo problems?
No child and 99 problems.

378
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,590
That's crazy.
They're sort of catchy,

379
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,330
but then I feel like I shouldn't like 
them.

380
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,590
Plagiarists Nah,
they tricked you.

381
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,660
Sometimes it's awesome.
It's some,

382
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:40,000
some of them don't work with me.
Some of them don't say unhip.

383
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,520
Yeah,
I,

384
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,480
I wasn't into it that much until I heard
that 99 problems.

385
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:48,270
Voodoo child mix.
That shit is so good.

386
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,060
Fuck yeah.
It's like one of the greatest songs.

387
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,210
Somebody get mashed up your Song 
Boutique Fernando with so many police.

388
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,640
Listen how good this is.

389
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,290
This shit works isn't actually the one 
that I'm used to.

390
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,230
What about that?
On the Godzilla soundtrack?

391
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,210
This is a different person.
He did that like 15,

392
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,500
16 years ago.
Well,

393
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,000
they did it together.
Who?

394
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,960
There was Robert Plant.
They actually did a song together,

395
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,970
but it was a Zeppelin song though.
There was that all that cashmere I was 

396
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,491
kind of.
Which was ridiculous because like you 

397
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:43,491
mean if you're going to like duplicate a
song,

398
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:46,360
like you do some shit from houses of the
holy that no one remembers.

399
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,210
You don't come out with cashmere.
I like that.

400
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:54,211
That's a classic wrapping aerosmith.
Did that walk this way because that was 

401
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,940
pretty fucking cool.
That was pretty cool.

402
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Yeah.
And when run DMC did their version of 

403
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,290
walk this way,
it was.

404
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,200
Aerosmith was like the idea of the video
is like them rehearsing next door.

405
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:13,201
These rappers and rappers are really 
unimpressed and we can't play arm knew 

406
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:14,080
this answer.
Atlanta real.

407
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,080
It's like one of the corniest most 
hokiest videos together,

408
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,100
you know,
especially because like Steven Tyler 

409
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,351
gets crazy with his mic stand.
He breaks through the wall where the 

410
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:25,351
rappers are,
you know,

411
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:25,780
and then they have respect for each 
other.

412
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:30,781
Like bitch,
get the fuck out of it would have 

413
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:31,480
dragged him through the hole in the wall
you just made.

414
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,620
It looks like an old lady at his crazy 
hair.

415
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,650
Fucking handkerchiefs on his head.
They would have beat the fuck out of 

416
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:40,650
him,
man.

417
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,070
It's so weird to see that guy as a on 
American idol

418
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,360
when people get old,
it's going to have.

419
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,570
No,
I don't,

420
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,880
I don't expect it.
So you don't expect.

421
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,950
I have not grown up even remotely other 
than my responsibilities have widened 

422
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,150
again.
So my mindset,

423
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,720
I mean I guess I'm at,
I'm sort of a little bit more 

424
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:06,720
disciplined 15 more years,
20 more years,

425
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,750
but it happens to all of them.
Howard Stern.

426
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,800
Yeah,
but I think it's all in.

427
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,830
First of all,
you got to make sure that you're having 

428
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,121
fun.
You got to make sure the friends that 

429
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,311
are also having fun,
you gotta like keep a community of 

430
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:20,311
people together.
That's what these people are all.

431
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:21,970
They're not keeping community.
People think that comes with a lot of,

432
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:22,840
um,
a lot of them,

433
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:24,970
they go solo and you know,
they just,

434
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:29,971
it's fucking them and the wife and 
occasionally go on stage and just get 

435
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:29,971
weird.

436
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:31,140
It's like a,
you reconsider revitive.

437
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,810
Something happens new again.
They get old and you know,

438
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:38,470
they always love to use that quote is 
one quote that I've used.

439
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,910
I've used it to show me a young man.
It's on the liberal.

440
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,250
I'll show you a man without a heart.
Show me an old man.

441
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,800
It's not conservative and I'll show you 
a man who has no brain.

442
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,810
Oh Wow.
Why?

443
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,530
Because he's mostly.
People are just a bunch of weak cuts.

444
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,440
At a certain point in time.
You got to really tell people to man up.

445
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,950
Uh,
I was having a conversation about 

446
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,621
boulder today with Mrs Rogan and we were
talking about how we really loved 

447
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,850
boulder and we even loved hippies until 
we lived in boulder.

448
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,020
Why?
Well,

449
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,570
when you live around hippies,
like when they're the majority,

450
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:13,990
when.
Yeah,

451
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,200
when,
when there's more than a,

452
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,420
you know,
a small percentage of hippies when 

453
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,611
they're around all the time acting where
it gets really annoying like there they 

454
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:23,950
can be fucking annoying.

455
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,020
Refreshing anymore.
There's so many kids that were like 

456
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,020
young kids that were begging for money.
Oh,

457
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,820
there was like,
what's,

458
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:31,570
what's the young kid?
Twenties.

459
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,150
Oh,
okay.

460
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,850
Like young just sitting there like 
sitting there with like asking for money

461
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,630
and I don't know if it's the,
maybe I just saw too many of them and 

462
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,890
maybe it was just really rare,
but it just seemed like in the owner,

463
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,930
the amount of like young people that 
were like just sort of like asking for 

464
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:51,370
people to help them.
You know what I'm saying?

465
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,390
Yeah.
That's like that in San Francisco and 

466
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,390
hate now.
Exactly.

467
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,370
And look,
there's nothing wrong with being in a 

468
00:22:59,370 --> 00:22:59,370
position where you need people to help 
you.

469
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,940
We've all been there.
It's not that,

470
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,130
but I've never been in a position where 
I'm sitting down with a fucking piece of

471
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,690
cardboard box open and I'm hoping 
somebody gives you money,

472
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,170
you're not doing anything unless I'm 
missing your whole past and you're 

473
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,850
completely mentally challenged enough 
and it's amazing that you're even 

474
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,280
sitting there and that you wrote please 
help.

475
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,590
Right,
but what's their feeling?

476
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,830
People just kick in and then you know,
you have money for dinner and he can 

477
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,650
give us a dollar for parking.
Like it was.

478
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,090
It was.
It becomes a kind of a weird.

479
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,550
Becomes a kind of a weird thing where 
you're like,

480
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:41,551
okay,
you guys need some discipline in your 

481
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:44,191
life.
It's one thing to a peaceful and loving 

482
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:44,191
and.
But the,

483
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:48,110
the real problem with the hippie life is
that it's a life of meandering,

484
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:53,180
a life of the world.
I'm sure that my next meal find its way 

485
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,680
to me.
I don't know how I'm going to do it,

486
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,810
but I'm sure my next meal will find its 
way to me.

487
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,740
I have trust in the universe and that 
kind of thinking.

488
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,830
They were like hippies that there.
Yes,

489
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,710
there was quite a few.
Yeah,

490
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,850
we.
Yeah,

491
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,310
there was.
It was really annoying,

492
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:07,640
man.

493
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,850
It was a was a,
there was a lot of really cool people 

494
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,820
don't get me wrong.
The majority were really cool,

495
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,760
like it's like 90 percent of them were 
fucking outstanding human beings.

496
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,940
The people there in boulder,
but the 10 percent of these fucking 

497
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,870
knuckle heads,
it wasn't even 10 percent.

498
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,670
It's just you've run into them all the 
time.

499
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,300
For the most part it was fine,
but when it kind of knowing,

500
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:34,301
it's like when you're holding the baby 
and they're asking for money and you're 

501
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:34,301
like,
come on man,

502
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:37,870
get the terminator where yeah,
I'm holding a baby and you're coming up 

503
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,770
trying to beg money.
Like I'm not really into like dealing 

504
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,590
with you right now.
Weird guy with strings.

505
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,260
You making the mistake of making eye 
contact a little bit.

506
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,130
It's like,
Oh fuck,

507
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,720
you're talking and everything.
Like what?

508
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,270
How did you get to this point where you 
need money from strangers?

509
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:55,270
Like there's,
there's must be some fucking shit 

510
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,061
decisions along the way.
Maybe I could help you with that better 

511
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:58,220
than just giving you $5 towards a 
homeless cup.

512
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:01,460
Once he said it was just a summer,
it was just like something to do.

513
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Be Homeless.
You could catch from the government but 

514
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,260
just know.
No,

515
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,260
not homeless,
but just the begging like,

516
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,150
oh,
gotta leave out other way.

517
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,890
Wow.
Yeah.

518
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:10,850
It's a weird thing,
man.

519
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I think it's really important to be 
surrounded by people that are also 

520
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:19,730
trying to get shit done,
that people that are having fun,

521
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,940
people that are enjoying their lives,
people that are trying to accomplish 

522
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,371
things.
And I don't mean in a materialistic 

523
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:30,041
sense.
I mean more in a creative sense in 

524
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:30,041
anything.
Like when you're like,

525
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:34,241
well you were just putting together like
you're special and you just recorded a 

526
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:34,990
special like a year after your last 
question.

527
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,820
I know that was a big deal for you,
but when you did that,

528
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:39,080
you know,
when you said that you do that,

529
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,670
I got inspired.
You know,

530
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:45,671
I get inspired when I hear other people 
really working at something towards 

531
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:46,960
something and really.
Yeah,

532
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,450
yeah,
yeah,

533
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,230
yeah,
absolutely.

534
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,170
But it becomes,
it's exciting,

535
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:54,230
you know,
I think it's super important and I think

536
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:59,231
that if you're a,
if you're not around people that are 

537
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:00,290
like that,
you can get fucking dull.

538
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,530
You can fall apart,
you can let this push in your 

539
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:05,530
outstanding person without doing 
anything.

540
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,940
There's nothing going on in your life,
you,

541
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,590
you like.
Why would you think that you're going to

542
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:11,510
keep growing?
You're not challenging yourself.

543
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,190
You're hanging out with your wife all 
the time,

544
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:18,191
you're not going anywhere and then all 
of sudden you're hosted American idol 

545
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:18,191
and I'm going,
what the fuck?

546
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:18,800
Yo,
what the fuck?

547
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,100
Where's the journey?
Yeah,

548
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,030
I know what you mean though.
Yeah.

549
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:26,090
When other people are doing shit,
you're like,

550
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:27,560
oh,
I mean it's very.

551
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,600
Yeah,
when other people were doing things,

552
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,520
it's very inspirational.
It's super,

553
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:36,521
super important.
And if you don't surround yourself with 

554
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:40,000
other people that are exciting and 
interesting and that you can have 

555
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,730
conversations with man,
you're going to have a shit life.

556
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,310
It's really that simple.
And that's people just sort of accept

557
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,410
that.
Do you think the people who like pair up

558
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:48,090
with people,
let's say other couples,

559
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:51,920
let's say that like to go traveling,
that'll probably help you travel,

560
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,010
just being next door to somebody who's 
just like does nothing and then you just

561
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,320
have your barbecues,
your house once in a while and that's 

562
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,021
it.
My parents lives were much better when 

563
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,240
my stepdad was working for this friend 
of his and they all lived in the same 

564
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,381
town.
They would all do things together when 

565
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:12,381
they were in Pennsylvania,
it's like their,

566
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,960
their life became more of like there was
a community thing going on there,

567
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,170
you know,
that's like,

568
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,280
that's very big for people.
So we,

569
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,330
we get loose sight of things because we 
think that what's really important is a 

570
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:29,180
career or you know,
getting yourself financially 

571
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,480
established,
buying your first home,

572
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,100
getting some told like that's what 
you're supposed to want you,

573
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,300
you,
it is they,

574
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,230
these are desirable things,
but without community their shit.

575
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,960
Yeah.
You can be a rich motherfucker living by

576
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:47,961
yourself,
crying your eyes out at the top of a 

577
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:49,851
hill and that's real.
I talked to a real estate guy wants a 

578
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,060
while ago and just move like it was like
an hour and a half north of La.

579
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:56,061
It's like it's you don't just for a few 
years and then you can go back and like 

580
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:56,061
what,
what are you talking about when you were

581
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:59,460
talking about buying a house because 
it's way cheaper houses and it's like,

582
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,620
what?
But I have to live there.

583
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,450
She's not just like,
wait.

584
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,960
I'm like,
I'm not going to live there.

585
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,600
You know,
the desert.

586
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,050
He can get a whole acre for $180.
Okay.

587
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,530
I mean,
what are you doing every day that's 

588
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,661
worth the amount of money that you would
say if you bought a home in the Nevada 

589
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,870
desert?
Living my life.

590
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:22,230
I talked to the guy once it's a while 
living in a truck stop.

591
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,680
Just being like a salesman of the front,
you know,

592
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,750
like a store.
And I was like,

593
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,880
how was that?
Because you got to go crazy by herself a

594
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:34,881
little bit.
I met this guy of like Vancouver or 

595
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:34,881
something and he goes,
yeah,

596
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:34,881
that's why I'm not there anymore.
Well,

597
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,650
because it was so fucking lonely,
you wouldn't see anyone except strangers

598
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:40,120
and very briefly,
oh Jesus,

599
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:41,940
that must be crazy.
That's like a prison.

600
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,690
It's not like,
oh,

601
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:45,330
get away from everybody for a little 
while and then it becomes your life.

602
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,370
Yeah.
I am of the opinion.

603
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Especially as I get older,
that is not healthy to be away from 

604
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,301
people.
I think you have to have some sense of 

605
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:56,301
community and they're loners or any,
any,

606
00:28:56,301 --> 00:29:00,520
any person that just wants to be by 
themselves alone in the woods all the 

607
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:00,520
time,
you know,

608
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,340
like no friends,
not saying hi to people.

609
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,870
Keep an eye on that motherfucker because
you know,

610
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,810
that's some uni bomber type shit.
I think it's,

611
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,900
I think it's this.
I think every person has a different 

612
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:11,900
level of how much they need other people
around them.

613
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,660
Yes,
and at some point they'll just be a 

614
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:16,660
curve,
like don't need anybody,

615
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,111
don't need anybody.
And then when somebody like 10 minutes 

616
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:19,111
in the back,
there were people,

617
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:19,500
I need people with some people that can 
be 10 days.

618
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Yeah,
I'm good for two days without saying 

619
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:24,680
anybody I can do that.
Really,

620
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,050
I like a day every now and then I'm just
decompression decompression day where I 

621
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,801
don't have to talk to anybody.
I could just sit and chill and get some 

622
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:34,680
reading done and you know,
maybe watch a documentary or something.

623
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:36,450
No,
just literally not communicated at all.

624
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,890
Your underwear.
It's nice.

625
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,880
Yeah,
those days are nice,

626
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,980
but they're just so rare.
But most important thing

627
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,950
is that you're stimulated on a regular 
basis.

628
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,790
You know,
you gotTa,

629
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:51,791
you gotTa have people around you that 
are stimulating and as soon as you get 

630
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,471
stuck in some sort of a rut where you 
don't have anything going on with your 

631
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:58,090
mind or it's challenging you,
you can have slowly rot away.

632
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,280
You're going to fall into that Rut to,
yeah,

633
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,440
I bet for.
Fuck yeah.

634
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,890
Yeah.
You,

635
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,120
we need a bunch of different things.
We need to be stimulated by our 

636
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,580
interests.
Whatever our interests are,

637
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:14,581
whether you're interested in cooking or 
whether it's carpentry or whether it's 

638
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:16,480
drawing or whether it's fucking golfing.
Whatever your interests are,

639
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,730
those dumb shits are important in your 
life.

640
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,790
Okay?
Interests are important because 

641
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,810
interests stimulate your mind,
interest in the job you have.

642
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,010
You fucking hate.
Yeah,

643
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,350
let's talk about it later.
So that's not your interest.

644
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,580
You.
Most people.

645
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,590
It's not.
If it is your lucky as fuck.

646
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,980
If you're a comedian and you know,
you actually love comedy man.

647
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:39,300
What have huge,
huge fucking blessing that is.

648
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,660
But you know,
for a lot of folks what they're good at 

649
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,900
and what they make can make a living and
it's not really what the thing is.

650
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,410
So they,
you know,

651
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,430
they go bowling on the weekends so they,
you know,

652
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,480
go through some duck hunting but they 
find something that stimulates them and 

653
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,311
I never really,
I kind of didn't understand that even 

654
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:01,411
though I was doing all those things,
it took me a long time to sort of piece 

655
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:04,801
that together.
Some people do open my comedy like that 

656
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:05,060
in their forties and fifties,
just first coffee shops.

657
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Yeah.
And it's not like I'm not trying to be 

658
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,160
successful.
It's just like doing it.

659
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,140
Then when you think about it,
they act as the same no matter what.

660
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,170
Sure.
If you're painting on your back porch 

661
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,170
with a grandmother or painting because 
your seller ship for a million dollars,

662
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,650
you're still just trying to make a good 
painter.

663
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,750
Yeah.
If you're doing it the right way,

664
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,140
it will be exactly the same.
It's for the joy of that.

665
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,130
The joy of the creation.
Yeah.

666
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:24,910
Yeah.
I mean,

667
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:29,911
I'm like you like if I have any one flub
anywhere in a bit it will drive me 

668
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,510
crazy.
If there's a hiccup in the jug,

669
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,540
there's a transition job that just seems
artificial shit will drive me crazy so I

670
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:43,990
could rush for an hour and 10 minutes 
where they just loved it and I'd get off

671
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:46,810
the stage.
I'll bet that fucking on the fucking bed

672
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,050
sucks.
I got to fix that fucking bed and that's

673
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,880
all I'll think about.
You know,

674
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,460
I can but it's Sydney,
Australia,

675
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:55,330
but I did that for awhile.

676
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,260
I was like,
I got no fucking.

677
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,250
It was just like for months,
but those are.

678
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,690
But as you work through something,
right?

679
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,750
Yeah.
You sort of Hash them out on the stage 

680
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,701
and I think is another thing that 
happens when you're working out new 

681
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:11,221
materials that you get to the point 
where you said it so many times that as 

682
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:11,710
your,
as you're saying it,

683
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:14,680
your brain seeks new ways to approach 
it.

684
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Oh,
because you like an isolation chamber 

685
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,710
for your fucking material material.
It's almost like a mantra.

686
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:23,140
Like you say it so many times,
it loses its meaning.

687
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,610
So as you're saying,
if you find like God saying this again,

688
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,950
you have some new way and or it could be
this and then you all of a sudden you go

689
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:33,040
into a new direction just to entertain 
yourself.

690
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,510
I mean how many times have you done 
that?

691
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:39,511
Gone down like completely ridiculous 
paths with a bit where it's like babies 

692
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:40,100
with big dicks

693
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,990
and machine guns and they fucking.
And then like doing,

694
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,020
it could have a machine gun safety latch
that was one machine doesn't seem 

695
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,410
possible,
but those kind of like ridiculous 

696
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,160
territory of your peanuts would be 
lacking and you might do one of those 

697
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,410
and it would only work that night and it
was for that night,

698
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:02,411
but every now and then you do one of 
those and then there'll be a piece in 

699
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:02,820
there that becomes a new chunk.
Yeah.

700
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,560
You know?
Yeah.

701
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,160
That's how you

702
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,470
fine things.
That's how I do it way I find.

703
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Yeah,
I do that in the writing itself through 

704
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:12,500
both.
It's a.

705
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,600
But I,
I find I get a lot of ideas lately from 

706
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,940
driving around with the car radio off 
often do that.

707
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,900
I do that when I'm,
when I'm,

708
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,950
I don't allow myself when I'm looking 
for the next storyteller show and I've 

709
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,120
thought of one yet,
you know,

710
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,920
I don't let myself use the radio.
Oh,

711
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,320
I get it done.
I like it.

712
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,730
Yeah.
That's smart.

713
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,390
Yeah.
There's something about the act of 

714
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,720
driving without a radio that your mind 
has to take in all those things.

715
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,430
You can't tune it out.
Yeah.

716
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,960
I saw a study that when you're on the 
phone,

717
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,640
even when you have an ear buds in or 
whatever,

718
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,700
your,
your peripheral vision goes down 20 

719
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:47,700
percent,
not me.

720
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,310
Okay,
well maybe.

721
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:52,390
But the studies show Super Douchey guy 
that's invulnerable,

722
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,090
but yeah,
but because your mind is not focusing on

723
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:56,500
that.
My mentality,

724
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:02,030
my mentality is I see everything always.
I'll rock that test and I got a 180 

725
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:04,240
degree vision of doctors.
They tested my site.

726
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,880
I saw to the right and left further than
any known him.

727
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,350
Wow,
that's amazing.

728
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,430
So don't worry about me with the fucking
ear buds or you're by yourself.

729
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,490
I'm sorry to tell you about yourself.
Super Douchey guy who never get sick.

730
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,200
I never get sick.
Where do you live?

731
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:21,960
In a plastic bubble.
You fucking cunt.

732
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,160
Got Sick.
Who are you?

733
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:29,161
Do you not eat pussy?
Every now and then you're going to get 

734
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:29,161
sick.
Okay.

735
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:29,161
Things are going

736
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:32,240
go wrong already even tried cheese 
sticks.

737
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,210
I'm not into that.
I'm totally organic.

738
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,950
I love that stimpson monster.
That your mushrooms.

739
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,680
No,
not that,

740
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:40,840
but when was like people say,
I don't,

741
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,770
I don't do that.
If I've never tried it,

742
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,170
right,
well they don't do it.

743
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:46,010
Then he goes,
I don't react well to psychedelics.

744
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,160
Those type of drugs because aren't 
getting any mushrooms.

745
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:50,360
It goes,
which ones have you done like that?

746
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,320
He goes,
oh,

747
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,130
no,
Campbell soup.

748
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,960
What would you know?
Why would you know if you don't do that?

749
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:59,961
Well,
Campbell mushroom soup it fucking trip 

750
00:34:59,961 --> 00:34:59,961
me out.
Took him back to high school,

751
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:01,710
flying through the hallways,
but now everything was blue.

752
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,730
Yeah.
Well there's people that are scared and 

753
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:07,730
rightly so,
you know,

754
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,121
for.
I don't encourage anybody to do 

755
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:11,121
anything.
In the beginning I did,

756
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:12,960
when I first started doing dmt and I did
mushrooms,

757
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,130
I was like,
fucking do it.

758
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:15,200
You should do it.
Go do it.

759
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,230
But now I feel like if you're not 
compelled to do it,

760
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:21,960
you shouldn't do it.
If you're not drawn into doing it,

761
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,600
you shouldn't do it.
And if you don't have a deep,

762
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:26,190
deep,
deep desire to do it,

763
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,910
I don't know about it might have 
developed with desire.

764
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,390
Yeah,
I,

765
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,690
yeah,
maybe.

766
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,850
But that's up to you.
That's you.

767
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,190
There's books out there,
there's videos you can watch.

768
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:40,191
There's artists,
articles you can read without too much 

769
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:40,191
investment

770
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:41,570
in your time and you can learn a lot of 
shit about silicide man,

771
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,590
you can learn a lot of shit about the 
history of it.

772
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:46,260
You can learn a lot of shit about the 
positive benefits on personality,

773
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,030
so if you want to do it,
go ahead.

774
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:51,480
But I'm not talking to you about it.
It says I can't do it anymore.

775
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,730
It was just.
I've talked to too many Wackos,

776
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,190
too many,
too many loons,

777
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,150
too many people that are in the cult of 
the mushroom and do the sacred mushrooms

778
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,730
going to get through all this?
Yeah.

779
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,730
Sometimes you're like,
all right,

780
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,220
easy.
I don't know what you mean by that.

781
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,630
Or they'll give you mushrooms.
Sometimes.

782
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,050
He's like,
Dude,

783
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I can't like.

784
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:09,600
Well right now.
I'm like,

785
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,200
am I doing it right now?
We're not doing mushrooms together.

786
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,520
Mr S FBI agent,
you would never do that.

787
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,530
Would you know?
It's weird to do mushrooms in front of 

788
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,040
people with people you don't even know.
I don't even smoke weed.

789
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,740
Oh yeah,
I'm done.

790
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,230
No,
it's just too much weirdness out there,

791
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:33,231
man,
and it all came from this guy in 

792
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:33,970
Cleveland that I'm positive was a comp.
What happened?

793
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,590
Said it was a cop.
He's asking me,

794
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,370
where did you get some dmt?
He was saying you don't want to get some

795
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:45,030
dmt crew cut on and like a like a 
fucking.

796
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,580
It was like a flight jacket.
Like I was looking at the way that guys 

797
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,021
dress and the fact that he's by himself 
and I'm looking at the fact that he's a 

798
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:58,671
shitty actor.
Like he was like acting when he was 

799
00:36:58,671 --> 00:36:58,671
talking to me.
I'm like,

800
00:36:58,671 --> 00:36:58,671
what are you talking about?
He goes,

801
00:36:58,671 --> 00:36:59,610
yeah,
you did that DMT,

802
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:00,390
right.
You know where to get it.

803
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,460
I go,
are you fucking for real?

804
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,010
Asking me if I know where to get illegal
drugs.

805
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,770
And when I said it like that loud,
he walked away.

806
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,310
Oh really?
Yeah,

807
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,020
because he got embarrassed and he walked
away.

808
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,450
He was like,
good cover.

809
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,890
You talk so good about it.
Friend to a friend.

810
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,250
Somebody wants something bad coming up 
to me asking me if where I can probably 

811
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:23,430
just a dumb person.
Oh No,

812
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:23,870
no,
no,

813
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:24,300
no,
no,

814
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:25,830
no.
It wasn't stone.

815
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:27,330
That's the thing.
Do you think it was a cop?

816
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,420
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure it was gone.

817
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,630
Well.
I have pretty good instincts,

818
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:30,420
man.
I mean,

819
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:34,290
I'm guessing obviously the little edge 
could grow in my imagination over time,

820
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,230
but I was very convinced that this guy 
was fishy as fuck.

821
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,420
Did you wait?
You know,

822
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,430
when people are lying to you know,
you know someone's bullshitting you or 

823
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,430
they're up to something.

824
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,920
Yeah,
there was something.

825
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
He was up to something and I've entered 
into a few of those circumstances 

826
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,000
though.
Anyway,

827
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,230
was like,
what am I doing this yourself?

828
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:49,990
And it's like,
oh,

829
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,190
well that's why when I said it loudly,
I said,

830
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:57,750
are you seriously asking me if I can get
you illegal drugs?

831
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,270
And then he just fucking got out of 
there.

832
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,350
He was like,
I am.

833
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,510
It's just too loud.
I was saying it loud and like group of 

834
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,920
people that were waiting in line to take
pictures and he just bolted.

835
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,290
Hey man,
Nuer gets dmt.

836
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,270
Can I get a gun from you?
A nice guy.

837
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,090
It's people that just really want the 
information.

838
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:17,250
They don't think like that.
They're asking another human.

839
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,680
This guy was asking me to get him 
something.

840
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,110
I was like,
Jesus Christ.

841
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:23,090
Dude.
Brian deese.

842
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Macquarie with strangers.
A stranger with weird.

843
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,140
Have you seen the trailer,
the red band trailer for a movie?

844
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,220
What's already new movie?
What's the red band trailer?

845
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,650
The inappropriate conduct.
And what is this?

846
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,650
It's a sketch movie.
He's in it a lot too.

847
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,940
Uh,
Laurie's along with,

848
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,990
uh,
along with,

849
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,270
uh,
Lindsey Lohan,

850
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:48,840
your favorite Lindsey wetlands.
And check this out.

851
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,880
Adrian Brody character.
This isn't even out yet.

852
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,400
What happened in this Adrian Brody?
Sorry.

853
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,670
Now make me gag.
Pinch off the guy that brought you this 

854
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:12,580
slept shop.
Oh,

855
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,170
I remember you telling me about this.

856
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:20,980
Okay.

857
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:26,900
Coke.

858
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,620
Yeah.

859
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,270
Chris Brown.

860
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,520
God,
what was that like?

861
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,550
Slanted.
Do Africa get the chicken to tell them 

862
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,710
about the bathroom sector?
The sector.

863
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,270
Those assholes.
Okay.

864
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:09,010
Was like,
I just think I heard my dick.

865
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,650
That is wrong.
Can I shoot you Adrian Brody in his 

866
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:27,840
finest performance since the pianist 
suckling pig.

867
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,770
He's.
Now you're ready to blow.

868
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:35,150
I'm just going to push your stool in 
real slow comedy.

869
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,060
How do you get through life like this?
Man,

870
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,030
this is crazy.
I still studied.

871
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,230
How does this help me drive this month?

872
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,370
Oh my God.
Already explained yourself.

873
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,470
Sketch.
Maybe I was only responsible.

874
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,500
The ones I did the sketches.
You did look like the world with real 

875
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,230
people.
Racist things.

876
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,090
That was great,
man.

877
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,090
I thought you were done with amazing 
racist.

878
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:06,070
She brought it back.
Yeah.

879
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,360
Somebody finally was able to put the 
money into it to do it right.

880
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,380
Which one did you?
Well,

881
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,030
you don't want to tell us.
Don't tell us what the gags.

882
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:16,031
Where shouldn't.
Obviously there was that wine to African

883
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,150
black folks.
Did you apologize to them?

884
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,700
Tell them it was a sketch.
How did they accept it?

885
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,710
Not really.
There's still mad at you.

886
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,720
That's not mad at me.
Black folks,

887
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,850
black jokes and be careful with that 
song.

888
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,030
He got

889
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,060
worked up to that point.
Rarely will people like,

890
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,600
oh,
okay,

891
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,520
cool.
I'm sorry.

892
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,760
What did you tell them?
Like how do you bring them down?

893
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,100
I didn't bring him down me to.
Oh,

894
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,070
you mean off off the emotional cliff?
Yeah,

895
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,440
yeah,
yeah,

896
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:45,890
yeah,
yeah.

897
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,700
You just get them to sign stuff and so 
you know,

898
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,120
I'm really sorry.
It's just.

899
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,860
But they still look at you like,
yeah,

900
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,210
I know.
Yeah,

901
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:00,220
you can run it.
You taken a crazy chance when you're 

902
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,220
just out there in the world running it.
A random folks.

903
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,300
Yeah.
Luckily most people are not murderers.

904
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,800
That's the boat thing.
It's in Santa Monica.

905
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,380
Oh,

906
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,630
but if I was joy ideas,
I'd say,

907
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:20,631
what the fuck is wrong with you?
What's the fuck is wrong with you dog?

908
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,730
I'm Monica.
I think it's coming up.

909
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,060
Got Chicken and a came after you dress 
like a gang banger.

910
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,370
Was he in fact a gang banger?
Who was that guy right there?

911
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,910
It looks so easy and ended up UAE.
I don't know.

912
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,330
The guy attacks.
You look it up.

913
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,920
It looks like he's a Dr Dre or somewhat 
dude.

914
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,390
It's just a plaid shirt.
He's dressed very gangsta like who's the

915
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:47,970
guy with the chicken?
Who's the other guy with you?

916
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,220
That was Dante.
Dante,

917
00:42:50,221 --> 00:42:51,180
the comedian.
Dante,

918
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:56,181
the comedian,
and he's offering them chicken dressed 

919
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:57,380
like a slave masters that was going on.
Then she's free,

920
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,610
man.
You can't let it get in their mouth.

921
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,220
Wow.
That looks hilarious.

922
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,820
Dante get hit or just you just may even 
safely on the boat.

923
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,470
Good for him.
He's a smart man.

924
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:14,190
Stay outside the blast range.
Just like we're going to order the 

925
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,190
Caprio from Django unchained.

926
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,760
You see emily,
what'd you think?

927
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,380
It's pretty good.
Pretty good fucking movie.

928
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:25,381
Yeah,
he knows how to make a good goddamn 

929
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:25,381
movie.
He makes things entertaining.

930
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:26,440
You know?
Even when it's off a little bit,

931
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:28,020
he's still fucking.
It's still funny shit.

932
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,140
Three hours,
man.

933
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:33,370
It was really fun to watch like the life
of Pi.

934
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,880
Everybody tells me that I've appraised 
in imaging movie come out yet.

935
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:42,510
I've seen it.
I've finished leap leap in the life of 

936
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,291
Pi that's supposed to get.
If you get a complete Karma Dharma from 

937
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,370
broadridge,
peaceful place,

938
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,400
whether I'm a vegetarian and I went to 
the Buddhist statues crying one Buddha 

939
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,750
beside his life of Pi.
He lived a life of Pi lives.

940
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,940
It lives on a boat with a tiger for a 
month.

941
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,100
Then it became friends,
shut the fuck up and will not go for 

942
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:08,800
him.
I'm not a child.

943
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,210
I'm not a fucking child.

944
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,710
Wouldn't the tiger fish forum and they 
bring them both?

945
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:17,711
I can.
I don't think the tiger willing to jump 

946
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:17,711
in the water and catch things for that 
guy.

947
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,440
I don't think they were really friends.
Bullshit movie.

948
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,260
You think the was.
He saw tiger on a boat,

949
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,780
the guy and then it's like,
oh beautiful.

950
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,570
Oh my God.
I got killed by a tiger that tiger off.

951
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:33,630
Even temporarily,
like he took a tuna from the tiger and 

952
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,690
he screamed at him and slap something on
the ground.

953
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,720
The idea that the tiger would go for 
that in a boat.

954
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,320
The Fuck Outta here,
man.

955
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,130
That's like a hamster telling you what 
to do.

956
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,160
That's what that's like.
It's like imagine you coming home and 

957
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,861
the hamsters telling you what to do.
You mentioned being in a boat and the 

958
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:51,930
hamsters telling you that it's going to 
eat and you're not going to get to eat.

959
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,550
You'd be like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

960
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,280
He'd grab that stupid thing and you'd 
kill it and you eat it.

961
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,870
That's exactly the tiger would done 
that.

962
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:59,270
Maybe we should have been two minutes 
long.

963
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Tiger season.
Look not only at the tiger was like 

964
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:06,370
hiding in the boat for like a whole day.
Spoiler alert.

965
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,980
You're going to be on a boat for a month
with the fucking tiger.

966
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:15,981
You have to do.
I mean there's gotta be some suspension 

967
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:15,981
of disbelief.
People love the book.

968
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:16,890
What did he do?
He just yelled at him because I ain't go

969
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:19,940
to use my friend.
We are one the tiger and I took griller.

970
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,230
We were.

971
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,410
We survived.

972
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,530
Iv is a beautiful visual movie that 
Angley guys a bad black mountain.

973
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,170
Did he did it?
That was beautiful visual too.

974
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:35,590
I don't know that.
I think singly isn't him?

975
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,230
I think so.
Brian,

976
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:38,430
you have seven computers in front of 
you?

977
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,380
Yeah.
Why don't you find that out?

978
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,580
What are you doing?
Surfing the web.

979
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,600
No.
Was looking up this crazy shit about 

980
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:46,600
Adam Carolla.
I don't know if you heard about what?

981
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,580
What is it?
He's one of the first podcasters to get 

982
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,860
sued by who,
for what a,

983
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,440
this big company that owns a bunch of 
patents,

984
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,920
uh,
when,

985
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:58,790
after Adam Corolla and the people that 
make,

986
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,920
uh,
some other podcasts that's pretty big 

987
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,860
and there are suing them,
I believe something.

988
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,560
See how stuff works.
Dot Com.

989
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,070
Uh,
it's about a playlist.

990
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,040
So it looks like.
What's a playlist?

991
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
Do you mean?
Uh,

992
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,450
this company called Personal Audio Llc.
Uh,

993
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:22,451
did a patent infringement lawsuit 
against apple recently in one and now 

994
00:46:22,451 --> 00:46:24,500
they're going after podcasters.
What are they suing for using the,

995
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,020
using the algorithm to do a list?
Yeah.

996
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:31,820
They're not really saying much yet and 
I'm Corolla hasn't sent anything yet,

997
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:35,360
but it's a Adam curl.
So I continue to say girls aren't funny.

998
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,810
I love the opportunity to lift others up
on it,

999
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,500
but it says that a personal audio is web
a website.

1000
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,500
The company says its patents.
A pioneer techniques now commonly used 

1001
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:50,870
today in portable players,
smartphones,

1002
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:52,160
tablets,
and other products.

1003
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,520
And it says that,
and it lists several pants from music 

1004
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:57,520
playlists,
podcasting,

1005
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,420
personalized recommendations and auto 
audio messaging.

1006
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,450
So is it like,
did he have a application that they're 

1007
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,421
saying infringed on a patent?
I know it sort of sounds like it seems 

1008
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:08,030
like this company has patents and 
podcasting,

1009
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,670
so I don't know what that means because 
it can't just be like,

1010
00:47:10,671 --> 00:47:15,671
Hey,
I put an audio file up and now you're 

1011
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:15,671
suing,
you know,

1012
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:18,700
so it has to be something about maybe he
has his own personal app and something 

1013
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,130
in that App.

1014
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,630
Well that's why I say that because smart
phones and tablets,

1015
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,220
that's,
that's why it looks like it.

1016
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,770
I'm hoping you don't really need calls 
to sue somebody.

1017
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,740
You can just sue.

1018
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,210
That's true.
And then it's out there.

1019
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,270
Yeah.
But I'm sure that they just won a 

1020
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,780
million dollar a lawsuit against apple 
so that they have going on here.

1021
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,130
Oh.
So maybe there's some sort of 

1022
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,360
application that apple has available.

1023
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,410
Probably some kind of playlist thing 
that's involved with making the APP and 

1024
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:52,600
uh,
because they want.

1025
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,390
It also says that they,
it's an involved with making the APP.

1026
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,600
They've,
they've entered the license agreements 

1027
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:00,600
with Sirius Xm radio,
coby,

1028
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Samsung,
Amazon,

1029
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,700
Motorola,
and have.

1030
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:07,050
Yeah.
So it looks like there's companies that 

1031
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,881
are actually entering licensing 
agreement agreements against probably 

1032
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:09,190
some kind of playlist thing or 
something.

1033
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,390
Huh?
That's interesting.

1034
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:15,391
Yeah.
So I guess it's probably the personal 

1035
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:15,650
apps that are doing it.

1036
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,900
Oh,
that's what you asked me if I have my 

1037
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:20,900
own APP.
Yeah.

1038
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:20,900
Oh yeah.
That's interesting.

1039
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,270
I have an APP but I didn't make,
wouldn't it be the maker of the APP?

1040
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:30,260
So I don't think I'm responsible for a 
fan made am I can't be.

1041
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,040
I didn't know that.
Can't.

1042
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,680
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna stop everybody from making.

1043
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,420
I mean look,
it would be stupid.

1044
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:39,570
Like they're making something for free 
that other people can enjoy.

1045
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:40,940
Why would I stop that?
That's true.

1046
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,280
And also it makes me wonder if like 
companies like Lipson who offers like 

1047
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,700
free APP.
I wonder if that makes lipson 

1048
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:50,860
accountable or every single one person 
who does that.

1049
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,900
Oh my God,
everyone's fucked if that's the case.

1050
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:53,860
Yeah.
Well,

1051
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:54,970
because it was like if,
if,

1052
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,240
if somebody makes printing supplies,
like they haven't done anything wrong.

1053
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:01,420
If you fucking cop just pirate a bunch 
of shirts.

1054
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,030
That's true.
Makes San Francisco 40 niners shirts.

1055
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,050
Yeah,
that's true.

1056
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

1057
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:11,221
How do you doing it is?
Do you think this is a real picture of 

1058
00:49:11,221 --> 00:49:11,221
Photoshop?
Because it's very.

1059
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:16,250
Oh my God.
Oh God,

1060
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:21,381
I hate that word by it.
The whole giant fucking rant on twitter 

1061
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:24,180
about that,
but no hit and people were saying that,

1062
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:26,310
oh,
it's supposed to represent like,

1063
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,570
you know,
not,

1064
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,600
not having hate now it just represents 
no trend represents celebrities.

1065
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:34,680
They're like,
look at me.

1066
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,150
I'm there to.
I'm cool too.

1067
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,300
It's the dumbest idea ever that the way 
to avoid hate is to draw on your face 

1068
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,901
and cover your lips with tape.
How much it's been nice to have to be 

1069
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:48,081
anti gay just because you're against the
fucking look of an ad campaign and why 

1070
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:51,531
does Amparo looks so gay in this photo?
He looks like he's wearing maker gate 

1071
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:52,380
them up.
They gave them on Photoshop.

1072
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:54,380
Right?
Like given blush and no know.

1073
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,820
It's just how they shot it.

1074
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,130
Yeah.
That's an odd little thing there and let

1075
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,360
her know,
hey,

1076
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,040
I saw that on so many people's pages,
the table.

1077
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,010
So many people walk in and then 
everybody's like,

1078
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,530
I want that too,
but it's not supporting the thing.

1079
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,540
It's about a trendy DM message.
Like the way to stop pain is to put tape

1080
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:14,610
over your mouth.
Like what?

1081
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,290
What do you.
What does that represent?

1082
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,940
Blow jobs.
What kind of image is that?

1083
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,770
A piece of tape over your fucking mouth.
How?

1084
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,110
How about just smiles?
How about people?

1085
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,610
Smile.
Yeah.

1086
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:27,010
What's the table with us?
That's the silence.

1087
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,040
Sure.
There's a reason for it.

1088
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,430
The reason is to get us to talk about it
comes out.

1089
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,350
That means you can't have cake come out 
of your mouth.

1090
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,990
Yes,
but that is not the hateful one.

1091
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,780
Or not saying he's not the hey buddies.
Not the hateful ones.

1092
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,240
There's all these celebrities,
all these different people that put tape

1093
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,580
over their fucking mouth and wrote no 
hate on their face.

1094
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,630
They're dumb or they got talked into 
doing it by a chick.

1095
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,790
That could be it too.
I wonder if anyone trying to put tape 

1096
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,391
over their mouth and put it over there 
in those two and then started to 

1097
00:50:55,391 --> 00:50:55,391
suffocate a little.
I think.

1098
00:50:55,391 --> 00:50:59,390
I think they would suffocate and 
trendiness sort of thing before they 

1099
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,570
would run out of air,
you know,

1100
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,950
hate and it's an h with a red eight 
because it's mission eight.

1101
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,770
Proposition eight was the,
the,

1102
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,660
the,
the,

1103
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,520
the proposition that made it illegal to 
have gay marriage.

1104
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,550
But why tape over your fucking mouth,
man,

1105
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:16,100
and why you have to draw on your face.
Okay.

1106
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,560
This beautiful,
sexy as fuck.

1107
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,690
Ever looked back.
Really at him,

1108
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,440
right?
He's got crew.

1109
00:51:23,441 --> 00:51:24,650
Palm it in his hair.

1110
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,440
He's got the little.
I looked like a fucking novella star.

1111
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,520
He looks awesome.
Yeah.

1112
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,240
Yeah.
Well we wish them luck.

1113
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,720
Lawsuits.
I wouldn't have sex with a guy like 

1114
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:36,720
that,
but I would want to hang out with them.

1115
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,210
He's a good dude.
He's a very good deal with those.

1116
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,830
Is You ever talked to him?
Have you ever done a show?

1117
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,480
It was fun guy,
man.

1118
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:42,800
I think I tried to get me on twitter to 
promote,

1119
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,790
especially when it comes out.
Yeah.

1120
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:49,791
He said he's a fun guy to talk to.
He's a motherfucker got so much 

1121
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:52,400
interesting shit going on in his head 
all the time.

1122
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:57,430
My friend listens to him and he said he 
just loves the David Allen greer 

1123
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:57,560
episodes because when Adam crawls,
like I got to do um,

1124
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,620
sponsors with mount,
so no cursing and David Allen greer 

1125
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,180
refuses to comply and then you just 
wasted.

1126
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,820
He goes,
you know,

1127
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,960
go to stamps.com
for all your content con con shit 

1128
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,180
comment.
She's like,

1129
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,950
keep doing that.
So the way he does commercials too,

1130
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,960
he,
this is how most people are doing it.

1131
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:19,990
They,
they break up the show into like little 

1132
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:19,990
chunks.
They do a bunch of them,

1133
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:22,190
they'll do like four of them.
They'll do them like every 15 minutes or

1134
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,990
half hour,
whatever you're going to do,

1135
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,020
but,
and then just say,

1136
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:25,540
okay,
here,

1137
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:30,550
this next segment,
this next hour is brought to you by so 

1138
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,711
and so.
That's just stops the whole flow of the 

1139
00:52:32,711 --> 00:52:32,711
conversation.
They just start reading paper.

1140
00:52:32,711 --> 00:52:37,670
Yeah.
And they've asked me to do that same 

1141
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,670
thing and I,
I can't do it.

1142
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,880
I get why.
That'd be a good one.

1143
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:40,550
But then people would put that in the 
beginning.

1144
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:41,960
Let's keep out of the way in the 
beginning.

1145
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,130
People skip right over that shit.

1146
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,500
Yeah,
but so what?

1147
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:50,501
That's fine too.
So what you know and sometimes they 

1148
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:50,501
don't.
And by the way the,

1149
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:54,730
the ads like a lot of times we've talked
bad shit during the ads and sometimes 

1150
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,541
they're funny and yeah,
we have to get to the user code named 

1151
00:52:58,541 --> 00:52:59,030
Rogan and Seritos shut off.
We get to all that stuff,

1152
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:01,910
but at the end of the day it's fun.
So fun.

1153
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,200
Yeah.
The show still free,

1154
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,240
you know,
we still have to pay for bandwidth and 

1155
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,240
everything like that,
but I refuse to interrupted if your,

1156
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,480
if your whole podcast was just the 
commercial part and you're like,

1157
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,410
you,
you Rogan Diaz and a red band.

1158
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,720
It was like three people here.
That would still be a very entertaining 

1159
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:20,720
pocket.
Oh yeah.

1160
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:20,720
We could.
Especially.

1161
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,670
We still had the flashlight.
We could have missed the flesh.

1162
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,200
I can't wait.
I get to see the site next week.

1163
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:25,990
I'm so happy

1164
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,150
you could say porn awards

1165
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,200
bring you some.
I have a gang of him.

1166
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:30,580
I told you they're just sitting in my 
office.

1167
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,980
Did you hear that?
Good news about the.

1168
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:33,480
Doug.
Stan hope trial by the way.

1169
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:38,481
That's fucking awesome.
The judge rules a ruling allows the 

1170
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:42,890
comics a duck.
Stan hope to release video accusing at 

1171
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:42,890
the port.
Saint Lucie,

1172
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:43,980
man of molestation.

1173
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:45,560
Whoa.
Court.

1174
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:50,830
So I'm doug and Andy Andrews just had a 
video of this guy who apparently 

1175
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:59,360
molested andy when he was young and he 
promised Andy a car.

1176
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,540
He had video of him doing what?
He had to a video of him accusing this 

1177
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,810
guy and the guy broke down.

1178
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,330
He also claimed that he served him 
alcohol,

1179
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:11,160
shown them Porno Porno movies like,
like he,

1180
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:12,830
he molested him like crazy

1181
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:19,770
to be quite about.
It's not press charges when you're 

1182
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:19,770
getting older.
Is that what it was?

1183
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,460
It's,
it's gonna.

1184
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,680
It's during a recorded.
During in January ninth,

1185
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,290
2009.
Performance of down and dirty on HBO.

1186
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:29,860
And they went and got the guy and they 
found him where he lived and,

1187
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:35,220
and I,
I forget how they got him to do an 

1188
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:35,220
interview with something else.
Right Joe?

1189
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,930
Yeah.
I don't know how they got them to do it.

1190
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,050
Somehow or another.
Got them to a meet and do the uh,

1191
00:54:41,051 --> 00:54:46,051
the interview where he accused him of a 
sexual predator.

1192
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,420
Wait,
so he paid them off to not talk?

1193
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,950
No.
They sued them somehow or another,

1194
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,980
the guy whose videos get released to 
doug and Andy saying,

1195
00:54:56,981 --> 00:54:57,940
don't release that.
Yeah,

1196
00:54:57,941 --> 00:54:58,630
I guess.

1197
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:04,400
Well,
several times from 1976 to 1981.

1198
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,230
Those are good years.
Those were good years.

1199
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,940
A massage them twice.
Why is it a five year period?

1200
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,740
And then when he was between 11 and 13

1201
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,750
can't count.
That's so fucked up,

1202
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:20,030
man.
So far they want to release this video,

1203
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:20,900
this guy,
this guy,

1204
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,700
this guy counterfeiting and crying.
The Guy said,

1205
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:26,340
uh,
you know,

1206
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:27,720
you were a sexual predator.
Me.

1207
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:28,850
Andy said that.
And the Guy said,

1208
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:33,851
uh Huh.
And the judge just ruled in favor of 

1209
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:33,851
Andy and said,
you can release us.

1210
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:33,851
Yes.

1211
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:35,440
Wow.
There hasn't been any comment.

1212
00:55:35,441 --> 00:55:37,030
If he's going to release it,
stand up.

1213
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:38,950
Says when and how the videos were 
released.

1214
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:41,410
It's up to andy that this is all andy's 
deal.

1215
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,350
I'll get out there though.
I guarantee that it'll get out there.

1216
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,990
Wow.
I'm sure it's,

1217
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,480
yeah,
I wonder why can't you like,

1218
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:54,510
I don't want to fucking.
I'm a black male and I'm putting this 

1219
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,030
video out of him saying what he did.
It's not.

1220
00:55:55,031 --> 00:55:58,360
The Punch was not worse.
He's just admitting to the thing he did.

1221
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,470
Right.
You know?

1222
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,530
Well,
you know what,

1223
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,010
with a lot of those guys,
it's about being exposed.

1224
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,680
Like once you're exposed to sexual 
predator,

1225
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:10,510
I can't imagine that they'd got away his
whole life and got away with it.

1226
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:12,840
I mean probably is already a sexual 
Predator somewhere.

1227
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,340
Wait til they find out.
You really think they got away with it 

1228
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,181
all this time.
It seems like the pretty policy that's 

1229
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:22,120
so fucked.
I just always assumed that if someone is

1230
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,240
out there and molesting and they,
they try to keep doing it and then get 

1231
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,180
caught because he can't do anything now 
because it's been over what,

1232
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:29,800
seven years or whatever it is.

1233
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,760
What is the statute of limitations 
expires and child molesting her.

1234
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,690
So you can just talk about it.
Thanks.

1235
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,300
So right.
And the ball doesn't get arrested.

1236
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,220
That's Kinda fucked.
I don't know.

1237
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:44,700
I know the statute of limitations 
limitations apply to everything it does 

1238
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,240
not apply to and there's federal statute
of limitations.

1239
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:47,150
Is there a state statute of limitations 
as well?

1240
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:47,860
Like if you say,
Hey,

1241
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:52,861
I killed jfk and he had proof,
they're probably still going to do 

1242
00:56:52,861 --> 00:56:52,861
something.
How old were you?

1243
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:57,130
This would be a great segment.
It's time for Brian redbands law advice.

1244
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,160
Hey,
I'm half.

1245
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:02,710
Watch that because somebody.
But it was 10 years ago.

1246
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,150
Do you think I can tell them about it 
now?

1247
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,830
Oh yeah.
That's plenty of time.

1248
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,820
You should brag about it to the family 
and if they do anything you can sue them

1249
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,040
and do the guy tell you he was a cop 
knows they don't tell you you're a cop,

1250
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:13,420
you're fine.

1251
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,180
Get off Scott free.
They did that in breaking bad was 

1252
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:19,870
something early on with somebody who's 
like trusted a cop and he was like,

1253
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,750
you'll copy goes because you got to tell
them that if you already I need set.

1254
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,400
It sold them and he goes,
you,

1255
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,890
what are you talking about?
Yeah.

1256
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:33,070
It's a weird sort of a myth that you 
have to tell someone.

1257
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:34,810
If they asked her,
are you a cop?

1258
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,780
I think there was always like hookers 
and movies would ask the Johns,

1259
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:42,810
are you a cop?
Did you get arrested for getting a 

1260
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:42,810
hooker in college?
No.

1261
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,090
Is that real?
Did you get arrested in college?

1262
00:57:43,091 --> 00:57:43,840
No,
it's just a joke.

1263
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,900
Got completely drunk.
The only thing I learned in college is 

1264
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:48,900
avoid hookers with walkie talkies was a 
joke.

1265
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,450
It was just a joke.
Oh,

1266
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:49,820
okay.

1267
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,220
No,
that's a complete fabrication.

1268
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,040
That was back in the days when I used to
write jokes.

1269
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:59,770
Jokes.
That's a good to have to once in awhile.

1270
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,240
Yeah.
There's a good,

1271
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:06,241
like a good solid one liner to pull you 
out of a ditch or to just set the stage 

1272
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,790
as long as it's like a good crisp one 
could have a complete game changer.

1273
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:17,680
Just like completely changed the tempo 
of where the show's going.

1274
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,950
Man,
there's a trailer for this new Kevin 

1275
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,200
Hart movie.
Kevin Hart apparently has this new 

1276
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,391
standup movie coming out and you see 
like the size of the crowds he's 

1277
00:58:27,391 --> 00:58:31,231
dealing.
Holy shuts the one with fucking pyro 

1278
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:31,990
techniques.
Yeah,

1279
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:32,790
I did.
They didn't show any,

1280
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,800
the PYRO,
I guess they're trying to save that as 

1281
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:37,870
fun.
But in the trailer they didn't show it.

1282
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,400
No,
but I mean you're talking about like,

1283
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,020
it looks like 18,000
people.

1284
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,330
It looks like the UFC.
He's doing massive places.

1285
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:46,090
Two crazy good for him.
Good for him.

1286
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:48,220
That's great for comedy.
Anytime a guy,

1287
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,930
people exposed to comedy.
Yeah.

1288
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:52,420
And anytime a guy that's that big,
you know,

1289
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,130
who does that?
Well,

1290
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,060
that's just stimulates the whole sort of
a comedy movement.

1291
00:58:58,061 --> 00:58:59,440
Like I see that like,
wow,

1292
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:02,620
like where were all these people like 
five years ago when there were all these

1293
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:03,570
people for any,
uh,

1294
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,670
any other comedian.
Well,

1295
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:09,671
there they were out there.
The fans are out there because nobody 

1296
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:09,671
had done anything that really resonated 
with them.

1297
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,270
With this guy,
you know,

1298
00:59:10,271 --> 00:59:14,050
they get them access to somehow.
Well he's the hot young guy,

1299
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,040
you know,
as far as like,

1300
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:17,500
uh,
especially like young black comedians.

1301
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,330
That's why cat Williams was upset at 
him.

1302
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,380
I took over his spot.
Yeah.

1303
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,010
Apparently,

1304
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,360
you know,
science was the hip one.

1305
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:25,730
Remember that especially did when you 
had all the celebrities come up,

1306
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:31,090
somebody from like little John or 
somebody come up and like do a lot by 

1307
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:34,340
Katt Williams and in his prime is still 
one of my all time favorites when he 

1308
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,891
says his especially was amazing looney 
behaviors he's involved with these days,

1309
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:42,470
whatever he goes off in front of a black
crowd on Michael Jackson.

1310
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,090
Yeah.
The honest way.

1311
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,220
The way everyone's ignoring,
like stop it.

1312
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:51,340
Like as a child molester,
you would never trust him with your 

1313
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,340
child,
you know,

1314
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,950
to a black audience.
They were like,

1315
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:53,960
what?
And he just fucking set it right at them

1316
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:55,430
over and over again.
It was like wow.

1317
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,900
He,
he beat them down with it,

1318
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,370
know,
beat them down with it.

1319
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,320
He's.
He was hilarious.

1320
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,330
He was fucking.
I mean maybe,

1321
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,340
maybe still is.
Maybe this is all trolling.

1322
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,770
Didn't.
What's his face?

1323
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,470
Joaquin Phoenix.
Troll everybody for a year.

1324
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:13,940
A year and we just saw cat and that new 
movie trailer where member,

1325
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,130
it's a documentary.
They talking about the new movie.

1326
01:00:19,131 --> 01:00:20,420
That's a scary movie.
Five.

1327
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,890
Oh yeah,
there's a,

1328
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,500
he's in a trailer where he goes,
nobody in the trailer.

1329
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:29,590
Oh really?
Well that's his whole thing was just a 

1330
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:29,590
big troll.
Right.

1331
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:29,590
It's just so we can like make a movie 
about it.

1332
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,681
Yeah.
That was the other guy's walking 

1333
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:33,681
phoenix.
Yeah.

1334
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:33,681
Yeah.
That was his thing.

1335
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:35,510
He was going on letterman pretending 
he's nuts.

1336
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,400
And what did he do?
He made a.

1337
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,410
They made a whatsapp.
Yeah.

1338
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:42,530
He was a rapper for awhile and he would 
fall down on purpose.

1339
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:47,930
No problem with that is then when 
anybody like Brittany Spears shaves her 

1340
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,680
head or Katt Williams goes crazy.
Like,

1341
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,620
Nah,
maybe it's just the publicity.

1342
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:52,540
So yeah,
I mean like,

1343
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:52,860
no,
no,

1344
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:55,160
no,
these people are in a bad place.

1345
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,780
Well,
Brittany,

1346
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,030
experience for sure.
Yeah,

1347
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:03,040
I think it's being like a hot girl 
singer like that has got to be one of 

1348
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:06,290
the.
Especially someone who's famous.

1349
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,530
Is that chickens?
Yeah,

1350
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,060
it's gotta be.
The pressure's got to be unimaginable to

1351
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:16,061
grow up in that pressure.
You have to go from being a mouseketeer 

1352
01:01:16,061 --> 01:01:16,061
to be a grown.
What?

1353
01:01:16,061 --> 01:01:17,720
Celebrities?
Other level of fame.

1354
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,040
Oh yes.
That worldwide.

1355
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:19,800
You know,
you can't,

1356
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:21,950
your bus gets mobbed.
Yeah.

1357
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,890
You know,
and does she even have her kids?

1358
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,330
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

1359
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,160
Yeah.
I think Kay feds got the kids,

1360
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,880
like when they don't even,
they don't give you your kids.

1361
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:36,881
Man.
That's not good because the state 

1362
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:36,881
saying,
I know noted the Richmond,

1363
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:37,580
but just like,
listen,

1364
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:39,330
this guy is,
he loves these guilty.

1365
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,750
Almost always give it to the girl.
Dude,

1366
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,520
I don't know how it's set up.

1367
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:47,510
It's got to be rare though,
that take kids away from the mother,

1368
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:49,160
the Scott.
It's not when they're.

1369
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:51,320
Everyone's healthy,
everyone's healthy.

1370
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:54,000
The kids generally stay with the mother.
They're less.

1371
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,120
Unless there's an agreement.
Ferguson's monologue about Brittany 

1372
01:01:59,120 --> 01:01:59,120
spears.
Yeah.

1373
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,270
It was really nice.
Yeah,

1374
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,000
it was very heartfelt.
You know,

1375
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:06,410
there's,
there's a certain amount of us that want

1376
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:09,920
to kick somebody when they're down.
They want to mock someone,

1377
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:14,921
whether it's Lindsay Lohan or whether 
it's anybody that's Paris Hilton or you 

1378
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:16,370
know,
when everyone is getting some,

1379
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,170
you know,
everyone's shitting on someone they want

1380
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:20,670
to just pile on.
They want to jump in.

1381
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,880
And whether it's about Brittany,
Brittany Murphy,

1382
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:26,220
or whether it's Brittany spears or 
whether it's Liz,

1383
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:29,760
will any of these girls don't like 
people love a lot this week.

1384
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,450
A small part of you was.
She was.

1385
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,000
I mean that thing with her when,
you know,

1386
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,480
when,
when she was falling apart and she ended

1387
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:38,490
up dying and then her husband died.

1388
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,520
Like all that shit.
Drugs,

1389
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:45,530
man doing heavy opiod.
Brittany Murphy had opiates in our 

1390
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,080
system.
This dude,

1391
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:51,081
there's so many people out there that 
are having problems right now with 

1392
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:51,081
opiates.
It's which one's opiates?

1393
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,490
Oxycontin's.
Heroin.

1394
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,700
Morphine.
I know a lot of jokes about,

1395
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:01,730
about pill sometimes.
And then when I go to the Midwest 

1396
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:01,730
sometimes my drug stuff,
I'm like,

1397
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:01,730
ah,
you guys aren't going to get my.

1398
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,030
And then I realized during that trip I 
was like,

1399
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:04,920
oh,
this is where this shit is from.

1400
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Anything else to do?
I shouldn't talk about school with 

1401
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:11,850
Brittany Murphy.
I'm assuming it was,

1402
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,080
it was oxycontins.
Now that I say that,

1403
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:16,630
I'm like,
no,

1404
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:21,300
it like a speed thing.
But it was in the system.

1405
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,920
I will.
Let's see what guy.

1406
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:27,921
That scene where m&M fucked her in the.
In the warehouse when she just spit on 

1407
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:28,290
her hand and put it down there.

1408
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,820
What a good kid.
God,

1409
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:30,990
that was hot.
Was it?

1410
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,100
Remember that?
From eight mile.

1411
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,340
Did you beat it off so that at all?
Oh yeah.

1412
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:36,720
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

1413
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:37,620
I was right.
Sorry.

1414
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:42,360
Multiple medications at present.
Elevated levels of hydrocodone.

1415
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,680
That's oxy?
Yep.

1416
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,520
Acetaminophen.
Aspirin?

1417
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,390
Yeah.
Cold medication.

1418
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:53,391
She's a cold ass honky chloro fen or m?
A L meth amphetamine.

1419
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,250
Oh my God.
She had meth in her.

1420
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:06,660
Jesus Christ.
This chick had a crazy cocktail man.

1421
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,300
Intel inside hydrocodone.
Hydrocodone.

1422
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:14,330
Okay.
And then I guess I gave her a headache 

1423
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,851
so she took some tylenol.
So we'll see the medicine in their 

1424
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:16,230
system.
Doesn't that sound a party?

1425
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,190
They're going to end meth amphetamine.
I think l methamphetamine.

1426
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,870
Is that the same?
No idea.

1427
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,820
Brian.
You ever do from Mexico?

1428
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:34,140
Let's Google it and see what pills do 
the.

1429
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,460
I don't do any pills.
I do once in a while we'll do some molly

1430
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:39,900
if that's around.
Yeah.

1431
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:40,880
No.
Okay.

1432
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,350
No,
no,

1433
01:04:41,351 --> 01:04:41,640
no,
no.

1434
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,070
I want to get that.
Not adderall,

1435
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:46,170
but that pill,
that other stuff.

1436
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:51,360
Adderall.
Methamphetamine is a level meth 

1437
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,910
amphetamine.
And what it is is a cold medication.

1438
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,060
It's a nasal decongestant.
Really?

1439
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,010
Yeah.
It's a vassal,

1440
01:04:57,090 --> 01:05:02,090
diaster vasyl constructor,
which is the active ingredient using 

1441
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,150
some over the counter nasal 
decongestants.

1442
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,860
So she was basically,
she was taking oxys and she got sick.

1443
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,770
Might have also been snorting the oxys 
well that's,

1444
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:14,100
she died from sickness.
She didn't die from the drugs.

1445
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:14,940
Oh really?
Yeah.

1446
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,010
Well,
much like Duisburg would.

1447
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,610
He would,
by the way,

1448
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:21,280
we do have someone who's got to debate 
Peter Duesberg.

1449
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:26,610
We have a professor of biology,
heavy duty phd dude who's down for the 

1450
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:28,440
program that he's a professor Tyson to 
do it,

1451
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,070
but he's going,
he's going to do it.

1452
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,050
Um,
so,

1453
01:05:31,051 --> 01:05:33,640
uh,
but I think much like his assertions,

1454
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,980
he,
he was saying he says a lot of crazy 

1455
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,720
shit about HIV that HIV only exists in 
the immune system.

1456
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:42,070
People that are already compromised.
And then what's really going on is those

1457
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,080
people are partying.
Well that's what she was doing.

1458
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:46,750
She was partying so hard that she was 
sick as fuck.

1459
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:51,810
So while she was sick as fuck,
he's taken all his nasal decongestants 

1460
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,541
and really what it was is her body was 
too weak to fight off anything because 

1461
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:56,390
she was as red lining and on heroin.
That's what was going on.

1462
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,580
Scary scary stuff.
But yeah,

1463
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,450
when,
when he,

1464
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,330
um,
when he separated himself from the pack,

1465
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:09,390
Craig Ferguson did,
when he did that thing about Britney 

1466
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:12,301
spears,
he said just a little girl is totally 

1467
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,060
got a problem.
She's got a substance abuse problem and 

1468
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:15,060
were making fun of it.
Like,

1469
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:15,060
it's fine.
She's a mom.

1470
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:15,640
She's fucking up her life.

1471
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:20,690
Tell Brittney today.
Can anyone watch Jay Leno anymore?

1472
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:24,180
More than anyone watched that?
Jay Leno enjoy it.

1473
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:29,190
Which age group is watching that?
I was Kimmel at 1130 now he beat a 

1474
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,870
Letterman is for show to us.
Good ratings.

1475
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,570
Gjelina was always been nice to me.
I'll always be nice to him.

1476
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,060
And we both liked cars.
Yeah.

1477
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:36,610
But man,

1478
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,590
well you should crazy

1479
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,710
walking thing.
All of it is just like,

1480
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,700
who are you playing to?
Hey,

1481
01:06:46,701 --> 01:06:49,720
you know the names of the people that 
are like being nice folks.

1482
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,830
Folks that when we were striking for 
Sag,

1483
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:59,831
I got my sag card by striking down the 
commercial strike of whatever it was 12 

1484
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:00,260
years ago.
And uh,

1485
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,080
he drove by and honked and like put his 
hands up,

1486
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,700
leaving his mansion in one of his 100 
automobiles.

1487
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:11,470
And what'd you guys any money though?
I got to pay for all this shit.

1488
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,980
I've never seen a guy on earth that has 
more cars.

1489
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:19,380
That must seem like such a job after a 
while.

1490
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,510
Maintaining those cars.
No.

1491
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,590
Doing that for 30 years.
Five days a week.

1492
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,480
The tonight show.
Fucking loves it though.

1493
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,430
We'll look.
I love doing this.

1494
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:27,240
You know,
I mean,

1495
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:30,420
this is obviously not the tonight show.
It's a lot easier.

1496
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,640
We just call it a day.
You want to say we're not doing this.

1497
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,520
That's what's beautiful about it,
but I love doing it.

1498
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:40,521
You know what I'm saying?
For him like the tonight show that one 

1499
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:41,310
hour a night that he does.
It's fucking exciting.

1500
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:42,630
Yeah.
He enjoys it.

1501
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,810
He likes being a funny guy with some 
funny shit to say.

1502
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:49,340
He likes sitting down and interviewing 
people and stories as material on stage.

1503
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,100
Yep.
Wow.

1504
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,830
Real stages.
Yep.

1505
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,300
He goes to the and comedy and Magic Club
every Sunday night,

1506
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:59,301
man,
every Sunday night he works out his 

1507
01:07:59,301 --> 01:07:59,301
monologue for the week.
Yep.

1508
01:07:59,301 --> 01:07:59,301
Yeah.
Got a bunch of jokes.

1509
01:07:59,301 --> 01:08:04,281
He wrote himself,
has comics over the eat fried chicken 

1510
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:04,281
and they write jokes.
How do you not love the guy?

1511
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,730
He's just doing shit that you don't 
like.

1512
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:08,610
He's just doing some Perry Como Shit.
You know what I mean?

1513
01:08:08,611 --> 01:08:10,350
He's doing some fucking,
you know,

1514
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,110
it's just whenever he says,
what's the news today?

1515
01:08:13,111 --> 01:08:14,370
I'm like,
why do you care?

1516
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,950
Why should he get a little edgy

1517
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,910
now?
And again,

1518
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:18,380
it's just,
you know,

1519
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:20,840
that job is not that.
That job is almost like,

1520
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:24,130
it's like you're a host,
you know,

1521
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:24,840
your,
your,

1522
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,350
your friendly host to get to get a 
couple of chuckles.

1523
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:32,470
You're not there to make any big points.
You're just there to sort of get 

1524
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,040
everybody grinning and then bring out 
the people that are selling books.

1525
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,680
Bring out the guy who's got a movie 
coming out,

1526
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,490
bring out this.
Pat would get like,

1527
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,650
I'm not into it,
but that's me.

1528
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:44,710
Maybe like I said,
some people really like talking to 

1529
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:44,710
celebrities to today.
I got up at eight,

1530
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,980
no,
9:00

1531
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:50,981
in the morning on Sunday and drove,
drove down to bellflower to play in a 

1532
01:08:50,981 --> 01:08:55,421
pool tournament.
How many fucking people excited to do 

1533
01:08:55,421 --> 01:08:59,591
that?
It's a tiny fraction of the world's 

1534
01:08:59,591 --> 01:08:59,591
population.
In fact,

1535
01:08:59,591 --> 01:08:59,870
if you told them they were going to do 
that,

1536
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:01,250
they'd be like the flood.

1537
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,330
I don't want to go play 30 am fucking 
suck at pool and I'm not going to get up

1538
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:07,550
in the morning and then drive all the 
way the fuck down there,

1539
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,740
but to me it was like,
let me get up,

1540
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,660
have a good breakfast,
try to get some coffee in me,

1541
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:13,580
wake up,
get there early and Knox and balls.

1542
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:16,040
As soon as you finished off in that 
tournament,

1543
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:17,120
went right back to another one.
Yeah,

1544
01:09:17,121 --> 01:09:20,030
I play it again on Monday night because 
Sunday night it didn't play good.

1545
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,800
I was not awake,
man.

1546
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:26,830
My.
I think if I'm ever going to play in a 

1547
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,110
tournament in the morning,
I gotta at least do some calisthenics,

1548
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:30,410
like I think maybe some jumping jacks or
something like really?

1549
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:36,240
Yeah,
maybe run up a couple flights of stairs 

1550
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,430
or something because I feel like my eyes
couldn't see that good yet.

1551
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:42,430
I was like,
I was like blinking a lot and my arm 

1552
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:42,430
wasn't loosened up.
I was just,

1553
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,150
I was still stretching.
I'd barely,

1554
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:49,151
you know,
being a week for like two hours or 

1555
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:49,151
whatever it fucking was when I,
when I first started playing.

1556
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:53,390
So I realized that like I need more 
preparation.

1557
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,760
If you're going to do something like 
toms to people on the phone,

1558
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,970
get loose a little more around.
It's really fun though.

1559
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,630
Stretch beforehand?
No,

1560
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:02,540
but I stretched during it sometimes like
you're like one out.

1561
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:04,370
So not my chance to shine.
I'll just sort of like,

1562
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,050
you know,
put my leg on something that's,

1563
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:09,270
you know,
I wear a batman outfit Bro.

1564
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:15,730
And a Cape and were a Mexican mask and a
n a n a fucking coward.

1565
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,410
Intimidate people.
If somebody came into a pool,

1566
01:10:18,411 --> 01:10:20,240
I'll just like that wanting to actually,
I'm going to be like,

1567
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:21,250
you're not getting my action.

1568
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,440
Do unique thing about pool is that 
nobody gives a fuck about anything else 

1569
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:31,430
in the poolroom except can you play.
That's like all they ever care about.

1570
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:36,460
It's like it's a.
it's like a place like pool halls are a 

1571
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,451
place where you have a whole group of 
people that are addicted to a very 

1572
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:44,110
specific activity and that's hugely 
important to them in that comedy.

1573
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,290
No,
no,

1574
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:45,710
no,
no.

1575
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:48,930
Like if you meet a guy in comedy and the
guy doesn't do stand up,

1576
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,900
it never bothers you or even if he's 
bad,

1577
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:52,610
but like a bigger guy,
a little,

1578
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:57,611
but it's not going to be like,
that bothered me for years I had to 

1579
01:10:57,611 --> 01:10:57,611
learn how to get over that.
When I came to the store,

1580
01:10:57,611 --> 01:11:01,931
I learned to get over that because there
was guys that are genuinely loved and I 

1581
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:05,171
would see there every week and I give 
them a big hug and I just have to leave 

1582
01:11:05,171 --> 01:11:06,200
the room and they went on stage,
but I realized as a person,

1583
01:11:06,201 --> 01:11:09,020
he's a great guy.
He's just whatever limits him up there,

1584
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:11,150
everyone's got their own struggles to 
get there or whatever.

1585
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:12,230
Their potential is.
Not that great.

1586
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:13,800
Whatever it is,
but it's like.

1587
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,620
But if you had a pool hall and you can't
play,

1588
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:18,270
they have no respect for,
you know,

1589
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:21,960
if the president was in the pool hall 
and he was fucking make it shitty shots,

1590
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:24,600
I just shake their head.
This motherfucker can't even get out.

1591
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:30,570
It's just,
it's a weird thing when people lock onto

1592
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,600
one obsession together and like a group 
of golfers all just getting good people 

1593
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,650
and I mean it's not even always about 
getting good at.

1594
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:41,220
Sometimes it's just about being obsessed
with a thing like people,

1595
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,160
people fantasy,
fantasy games,

1596
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,510
you know,
fantasy football.

1597
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:48,030
Even they'll get together and like 
games.

1598
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,450
Those people always want to tell you 
about their Goddamn fucking roster.

1599
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,920
Can't believe Erin foster.
All we did was six more yards to the 

1600
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,370
end.
And then he goes,

1601
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:04,820
why would anyone,
even the people in your league aren't 

1602
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,910
entertained by this?
Did you hear about that junior,

1603
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,250
how you say his last name,
junior sale during the sale,

1604
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,500
the guy who committed suicide,
they,

1605
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:15,501
um,
they found that he had cte had chronic 

1606
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:15,840
brain disease.

1607
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:16,710
Yeah,
I saw the headline.

1608
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:17,190
What does it,
you.

1609
01:12:17,191 --> 01:12:18,480
That's what it was.
It's from traumatic.

1610
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:21,630
That was,
that was a football related to suicide.

1611
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,620
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

1612
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:23,820
Yeah.
It's so true.

1613
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,630
Traumatic brain disorder,
they uh,

1614
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,610
yeah,
it's bad.

1615
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,490
It's very bad when people are 
intentionally leaving the brains over to

1616
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,770
study.
So the other football players don't have

1617
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:33,570
to go through this and it's multiple.
Yeah,

1618
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,780
I'm starting to think football.
Yeah.

1619
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,900
Um,
you know,

1620
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,960
I think um,
it's very important to figure out like 

1621
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,220
when this starts happening and how to 
cut it off.

1622
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,230
Like I think you can take a few hits as 
a young man and I think you could take a

1623
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:50,880
few knockouts in fighting.
You could get,

1624
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,260
it could be fun your later years,
but how many Kenya?

1625
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,210
I don't think they know.
They don't know and it varies.

1626
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:58,770
That's another problem.
It's also.

1627
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:00,600
I read this thing about a guy who 
committed suicide,

1628
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:03,540
who got knocked unconscious,
high school football player,

1629
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:04,650
real friendly.

1630
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:09,650
Nice.
Everyone loved them and then they sat 

1631
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:12,771
him out and he did this stuff that was a
stimulating to his mind.

1632
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,080
He went to a concert,
played a bunch of video games and 

1633
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:18,720
committed suicide and they were like,
yeah,

1634
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,430
you're supposed to take off from all 
that.

1635
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,820
Barely read if anything,
but like sit alone.

1636
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,870
No loud music because he played video 
games and went to stimulate his mind too

1637
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:28,920
much.
It was just in his,

1638
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,630
in his concussed mind.
Couldn't handle it.

1639
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,640
So it just went out and killed himself.
Yeah,

1640
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:37,641
he got super depressed.
They called him down for dinner and he 

1641
01:13:37,641 --> 01:13:39,030
was like not coming down.
Hanging God Jesus is coming.

1642
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,060
I mean,
he showed no signs of depression prior 

1643
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:44,060
and they were like,
this can easily be caused by concussions

1644
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,870
until they're out of your system.
There's so much they don't understand.

1645
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:51,650
Yeah.
The the kind of concussions that you 

1646
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:51,650
get,
and football too,

1647
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:54,030
boy,
you get people running at you.

1648
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:59,340
Of course when you're running that way 
and they're running this way and also 

1649
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:04,461
it's like the ones where you don't get a
concussion and you just get wrong over 

1650
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:07,911
and over and over again.
You're hitting helmets with other 

1651
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:07,911
people.
In fact,

1652
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:11,181
they say that that's the biggest issue.
It's not even the actual concussions 

1653
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:12,400
themselves.
It's subconcussive trauma

1654
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:17,400
that accumulates.
They're saying that that's why people 

1655
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:17,400
who've never been knocked out in the 
gym,

1656
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:22,171
they.
There's been hit so many times and then 

1657
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:23,140
all of a sudden out of nowhere,
for whatever reason,

1658
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:28,141
they're just their brain breaks and then
they can't get hit anymore and you can 

1659
01:14:28,141 --> 01:14:31,861
hit them and they just fall down.
Like it's a weird thing that happens to 

1660
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:32,050
guys just.
They just lose their chin.

1661
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,930
They completely lose their chin and 
it's.

1662
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,860
It's seen that the UFC enough to have.
Once you get knocked out once,

1663
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,760
I don't know if it's because you're 
probably a little slower and that's why 

1664
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,791
it got knocked out,
so you continue to get slower or just 

1665
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:46,791
your Chin is opened up.
Well,

1666
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,550
actually talked to chocolate Dell about 
this case.

1667
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:52,270
I was thinking of to what Chuck said is 
that first of all,

1668
01:14:52,271 --> 01:14:56,440
chuck was legendary for his ability to 
take a punch land touchable.

1669
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:59,440
Just.
He just was tough as fuck.

1670
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:02,350
He would bite down on his mouthpiece and
swing at,

1671
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:07,380
you know,
like Alistair overeem and him fought in 

1672
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,700
pride in the Grand Prix.
The two.

1673
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:09,370
Oh,
200,

1674
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:13,060
three pound Grand Prix.
I think their version of it,

1675
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:18,061
they didn't call it light heavyweight.
I think they called it middleweight and 

1676
01:15:18,061 --> 01:15:20,530
allister put it on him in that first 
round man tagged him.

1677
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:25,690
He didn't with some vicious shots,
but chuck Liddell just gritted down and 

1678
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:30,211
eventually cracked out there with an 
overhand right and had them wobbled and 

1679
01:15:30,211 --> 01:15:30,460
then jumped all over him and stopped 
him.

1680
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,730
If he was,
a lot of other guys would have went down

1681
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:34,820
in that first round.
He's like,

1682
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,260
chuck was just so tough.
You couldn't stop him.

1683
01:15:38,261 --> 01:15:42,580
His mind was so strong he was coming at 
you and he was so determined and what he

1684
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:47,581
said was that his body recognized that 
his mind was going to make it take more 

1685
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:51,730
damage so it's body would shut off.

1686
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,870
His consciousness would actually shut 
itself off because it starts to evolve.

1687
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,680
It had known that this guy,
this leads to damage.

1688
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,740
When you get hit like this,
if you let this guy drive you,

1689
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,010
he's going to keep going until the 
wheels fall off and he'll,

1690
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:08,620
he'll take 100 shots to the head,
just deliver one,

1691
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,690
and then you got to deal with the 
consequences of that.

1692
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:14,470
So the body would shut itself off early.
So we need to be getting.

1693
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,840
You get tagged and your brain just says 
that's it.

1694
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:19,510
Check please.
And just wants to shut you off.

1695
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,500
Wow.
So if you look in like chuck's this last

1696
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:24,980
fight with rich Franklin,
you know,

1697
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,640
perfect example because he looks in 
tremendous shape.

1698
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:30,190
He looks fucking scary.
I mean he's really ripped.

1699
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:35,550
His wife is a fitness enthusiast and she
got him like eating healthy and wearing 

1700
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:40,951
a like a,
a heart rate monitor and doing all this 

1701
01:16:40,951 --> 01:16:44,131
shit that he'd never done before and 
Kennedy's calories every day and eating 

1702
01:16:44,131 --> 01:16:45,040
really healthy foods,
so he got in super good shape,

1703
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:47,170
so he was down for this rich Franklin 
fight,

1704
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,380
broke rich Franklin's arm with a big 
kick in the first round,

1705
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:54,970
maybe rich Franklin fucked going into 
that round and chuck is just going after

1706
01:16:54,971 --> 01:16:59,200
him and he gets clipped with a punch 
that five years ago he would have ate it

1707
01:16:59,201 --> 01:16:59,920
like a cookie.

1708
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:03,040
He would have just ate that punch and 
just fucking swing done it,

1709
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,020
but it's his brain said,
check,

1710
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:10,021
please just shut them off.
And it was literally not a case of 

1711
01:17:10,021 --> 01:17:12,800
ability and not a case of will,
but in case of his,

1712
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:17,900
his just take too many shots,
so that's what happens according to him 

1713
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,800
and chuck and he would know better than 
anybody.

1714
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,290
What makes sense.
He's very honest about it.

1715
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,470
Then once you have been exposed,
like you're just done,

1716
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:27,471
you're done.
The first time probably it was already 

1717
01:17:27,471 --> 01:17:27,970
your body and made the decision to get 
knocked out of bodies,

1718
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,230
like just go off anytime it happens,
it's bad.

1719
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:35,231
Whether it's the first time or the last.
It's always bad when you get a 

1720
01:17:35,231 --> 01:17:35,231
concussion.
There's never a good concussion,

1721
01:17:35,231 --> 01:17:40,000
but I think it did really varies for 
some people they can get knocked out a 

1722
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:40,670
few times.

1723
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:45,670
It'd be fine.
For other people it's like one knockout 

1724
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:46,670
could change their entire life and it's 
all those.

1725
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:51,671
You have to think about all the shit 
that happened and when you were young 

1726
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:51,671
too,
but you don't really remember.

1727
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:51,671
I mean,
how many times did you hit your head?

1728
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:56,710
I hit my head a bunch of scars all over 
the back of my head that aren't just my 

1729
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,990
hair transplants,
like big ass scars.

1730
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:03,080
I could bring my husband child being 
like one of those oversized puppies on 

1731
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,110
the linoleum floor and just like running
machine and smash get up,

1732
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:11,111
run again.
I had way too much energy and that just 

1733
01:18:11,111 --> 01:18:11,570
no direction for it at all.
I was always getting hurt.

1734
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,310
Yeah.
I was always doing stupid shit.

1735
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:18,340
You know when you're a young guy,
like if you ever seen those videos of 

1736
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,970
those young teens in Russia that are 
always doing insane things like they.

1737
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:25,060
They did a bungee cord,
homemade bungee cord off the roof of a 

1738
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:25,300
building in the middle of the winter 
break.

1739
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,700
No,
but this girl hung onto this bungee cord

1740
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:31,190
that it looks like they made it with 
some fucking cables.

1741
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:36,191
They found.
She jumps off the fucking roof 

1742
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:36,191
screaming.
Wow.

1743
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:37,700
And there's another one of these Russian
kids that are on a beam.

1744
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:42,701
It's 900 feet above the fucking ground,
900 feet in.

1745
01:18:42,721 --> 01:18:47,721
This guy is walking this tightrope above
this beam and videotaping and at the 

1746
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:49,320
same time,
and you will shit your pants when you're

1747
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,880
so high up.
I was a kid man before I got into 

1748
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,401
martial arts.
I did all kinds of stupid shit that I 

1749
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:57,740
could have done from.
I jumped on the back of a train and hung

1750
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:00,320
on as a train.
Went from stop to stop.

1751
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:04,800
Really man.
I hung onto a train on the outside.

1752
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,990
Me and my friend Jimmy,
we both.

1753
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:11,950
This is a newton and we hopped on a tee.
It was fucking terrifying thing was 

1754
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:14,990
going so fast with so stupid because 
when you're a teenager,

1755
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:17,510
when you're 14 years old or whatever the
fuck we were were just.

1756
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:19,720
You just do it.
Just do this dumb.

1757
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:24,730
You don't know the consequences are 
possible consequences and you also want 

1758
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:28,381
to like prove to your friends you're not
scared and you want to do something 

1759
01:19:28,381 --> 01:19:31,001
crazy,
so they'll talk about you do that with 

1760
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:31,970
everyone isn't doing that with their 
emotions,

1761
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:33,890
their heart for awhile.
Your pour yourself into.

1762
01:19:33,891 --> 01:19:38,891
Some girls can't do that anymore.
Your body starts to like protect itself.

1763
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,940
Boy,
he's in love.

1764
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,440
Like when you're 15,
yeah,

1765
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:48,290
you can lose your whole identity,
but you also become a sex addict.

1766
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:53,320
You know,
once you start fucking and you realize 

1767
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:53,320
like,
oh my God,

1768
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,650
like this crazy feeling the flavor.
You don't.

1769
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:59,060
You can never really understand quite 
how good sex feels until you have sex.

1770
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:01,610
However you.
I think it was.

1771
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:06,670
What else?
I think the actual intercourse was like 

1772
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,410
a month before my 16th birthday.
That's.

1773
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,010
That seems too

1774
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,090
young to me.
Oh,

1775
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:11,580
you don't know what the fuck you doing?
I was laying.

1776
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:15,240
It was a late,
late bloomer.

1777
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:16,410
I was 23.
Yeah,

1778
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:18,060
23.
Well,

1779
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:23,061
I'm,
I'm pretty sure my girlfriend was not a 

1780
01:20:23,061 --> 01:20:24,450
virgin at the time.
I had a miscarriage at 15.

1781
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:28,190
Was that a no toilet?
No,

1782
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,010
no.
The girl was doing.

1783
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:31,380
Duh.
I remember looking at it going,

1784
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,920
wait.
She really had her miscarriage in a 

1785
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:36,920
toilet.
Yeah,

1786
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,650
a gross looking what did it and if that 
was just watching that and she had the 

1787
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:40,200
baby.
Can you imagine how different that would

1788
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:41,010
be?
Oh,

1789
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:46,011
your whole life.
Someone just told me something that I 

1790
01:20:46,011 --> 01:20:46,230
have to look up because I just 
remembered that about sheep.

1791
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,800
Know about sheep that you can have sex 
with a sheep and it conceives like some 

1792
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:55,210
sort of an embryotic fetus that always 
gets a board.

1793
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,160
It would always,
um,

1794
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:56,980
a miscarriage.

1795
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:01,680
She passed the third closest.
A vagina then a human.

1796
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:02,760
Yeah.
I'm,

1797
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,490
I'm not.
I'm going to find out.

1798
01:21:08,491 --> 01:21:10,290
Um,
is there any more weed in here?

1799
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,030
Of course there's,
there's always weeding here.

1800
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:12,900
Oh,
you got yours.

1801
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:17,940
Legitly all in one.
I'm trying to find whether or not this 

1802
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:23,331
is true and if it's not true,
I'm going to be very upset with people 

1803
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:26,781
on twitter.
A lot of people were going crazy that 

1804
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,160
you said that a hydro coating is not.
People are saying it's not oxy.

1805
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,050
Oxy,
oxy,

1806
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:32,990
hydrocodone.
Vicodin.

1807
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,320
Oh,
she had Vicodin,

1808
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,540
so it was viking thing.
Okay.

1809
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:37,650
That's not,
I don't think,

1810
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:41,790
or vicodins and opiate.
All that Shit's gross.

1811
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:46,020
All it is is bad or whatever.
This poor girl.

1812
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,820
My point remains.
It's like she was.

1813
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:49,290
Um,
thanks for the correction.

1814
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:50,880
Vikatin opiate.

1815
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:54,300
Yes.
Viking in as an opiate.

1816
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:55,810
Um.
Yeah.

1817
01:21:55,811 --> 01:21:56,250
It's.
Yeah,

1818
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,680
that's exactly what it was.
If I could in his hydrocodone.

1819
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,470
Okay.
Now we know it's all opiates,

1820
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:06,471
man.
So essentially it's all the shit that 

1821
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:06,471
we're in Afghanistan for.
Allegedly.

1822
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:09,030
Allegedly.
Have you ever done a vicodins?

1823
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,710
Oh yeah,
tons of times.

1824
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,260
I did vicodins once and I don't like it.
I don't like it.

1825
01:22:14,261 --> 01:22:15,030
Okay.
We talked about this.

1826
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:17,220
We both don't like Vicodin.
That's right.

1827
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,710
It's hydrocodone.
Hydrocodone is vicodin.

1828
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,300
Oh really?
Yeah.

1829
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,140
What's oxy?
Oxycodone?

1830
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:23,990
Yeah.
Ahcccs.

1831
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:28,560
Oxycodone.
Hydrocodone is a Vicodin oxycodone,

1832
01:22:28,561 --> 01:22:30,620
I guess.
Oh yeah,

1833
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:35,550
I took out a bunch for like for like 
after a surgery it really stops you up.

1834
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,610
It's.
Yeah,

1835
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:40,170
shit at all.
It's just you don't get shit done.

1836
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:41,130
It's just.
Oh yeah,

1837
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,500
I think it's for like,
well,

1838
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,750
some people use it differently.
My friends have used it.

1839
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,060
I mean I like it when I'm in pain to 
cover the pain,

1840
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:49,650
but then it's like I won't be doing 
anything right,

1841
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,550
but some people love fucking killing all
the pain.

1842
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,520
One of those and a beer and it's like I 
mentioned,

1843
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:59,550
it's a good night.
There's no way you can impregnate a 

1844
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:00,840
fucking sheep and I can't even believe 
I'm looking this up.

1845
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:04,860
I was in the middle of the middle of 
doing this.

1846
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:05,930
Just make it up.

1847
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,530
Mike.
How can I say it?

1848
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:07,970
No,
no,

1849
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:08,280
no,
no.

1850
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:13,600
The third closest vagina.
Someone said it to me and he's not a 

1851
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:13,600
dummy.
That's what was.

1852
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,520
It was a very successful man.
Is it just whatever we put in there 

1853
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:17,890
fills up a sack.
Well,

1854
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:21,370
there's a thing that people need to stop
doing with shit like this.

1855
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:24,370
Just go google it and then tell me,
Oh,

1856
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:29,450
know I heard,
don't just tell me that a sheep can get 

1857
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:31,570
pregnant from a fucking dude.
Son of a bitch can put this.

1858
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:36,580
Apparently this is a very math because 
there's a lot of these questions ever 

1859
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:38,880
all over this.

1860
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:43,920
While humans can impregnate apes,
they cannot impregnate.

1861
01:23:43,921 --> 01:23:45,860
She'd gotten pregnant apes.
Wait,

1862
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,240
what?
Backed that up?

1863
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:49,360
Fuck back that up.
Okay,

1864
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:50,440
let's see.
Can the human.

1865
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,770
Well,
that's that humanity.

1866
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,540
You know,
we played that a couple of days ago.

1867
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,190
Um,
the uh,

1868
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:02,310
the weird chimpanzee that people 
suspected was a hybrid they thought of 

1869
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:05,050
because he walked straight up.
It had like a hairless face.

1870
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:06,510
It's really,
really unusual.

1871
01:24:06,511 --> 01:24:07,080
They said,
no,

1872
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,070
no,
it was just so fucked up champ.

1873
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:12,530
Just like a bunch of wacky things going 
on with its,

1874
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,910
with its genetics.
But when you looked at it,

1875
01:24:14,911 --> 01:24:17,180
it was really.
You've never seen seen that humanity.

1876
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,690
Oliver's name's Oliver Post.
Face up,

1877
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:24,691
Brian,
just so you can a human and I'll look 

1878
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:24,691
up.
Can a human in pregnant an ape?

1879
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:26,200
What's his name again?
Oliver.

1880
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:31,300
The commands that humanity can,
the human and pregnant and a I say no,

1881
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,700
I say someone was wrong.

1882
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:36,220
That seems like it shouldn't be allowed 
by nature.

1883
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,880
They had to work really hard to get a 
donkey and a fucking horse together.

1884
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,940
Okay.
It looks like they tried to do it in the

1885
01:24:42,941 --> 01:24:45,640
19 twenties.
Who did?

1886
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,070
Well,
here's the issue to chimpanzees.

1887
01:24:48,071 --> 01:24:51,190
Have the United States government did.
Oh,

1888
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:53,150
that's not.
That looks like Jeff Scott.

1889
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:54,930
How dare you?
That's it.

1890
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,280
That's it right there.
The gray,

1891
01:24:56,281 --> 01:24:58,030
the black and white one because it was a
long time ago.

1892
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,740
Look at his face.
It's really weird.

1893
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:05,070
It's got no hair on it.
That's a hard one too because it's a 

1894
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:05,290
closer look at the other one.
Look at that one.

1895
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:06,550
The far left.
The far left.

1896
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:11,340
Far left up above that.
Yeah.

1897
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,870
Looks like that.
Looks like a monkey to right.

1898
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,370
That looks like someone put glasses.
That's not real though,

1899
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:16,180
Dude.
They took.

1900
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:18,310
What's her name?
Who's the black guy?

1901
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:21,220
He makes other movies.
Chimps have 48 chromosomes.

1902
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:23,380
No,
makes like a one movie.

1903
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:24,070
What?
Tyler Perry.

1904
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,270
Tyler Perry.
Chimps have 48 chromosomes in,

1905
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,610
humans have 46,
so it really doesn't make sense.

1906
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,590
Apparently that they could.
They could mate.

1907
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:36,100
So if a fetus,
horses and donkeys at the same amount of

1908
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,490
chromosomes.
What about tigers and lions?

1909
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:44,940
What the chromosome.
All Tigers and lions can make that 

1910
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:44,940
become a lagger.
Yeah.

1911
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:45,430
Yeah.
The laggers are barren,

1912
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:47,020
right?
Exactly.

1913
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,350
Same with mule.
Talking to horse.

1914
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:54,410
Yeah.
A lot of times hybrids can't breed for 

1915
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:55,750
some strange reason because God says no.
God says you're going to go around me so

1916
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:57,520
much.
You fucked up Mr.

1917
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:00,460
Rock Bass.
I wore a diaper all day on Tuesday,

1918
01:26:00,461 --> 01:26:02,950
son of a bitch.
How that just shit in it.

1919
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,020
Interesting.
No,

1920
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,790
I pissed in it.
Um,

1921
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,970
and that felt weird.
I pooped in my and yeah,

1922
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,540
he had his whole joke used to do about 
it.

1923
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,500
Yeah.
This is,

1924
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,360
depends on what they make them,
like underwear looking now.

1925
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:16,460
Yeah,
they're really great.

1926
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,460
I pooped and then went to target.
Oh,

1927
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:20,380
with it in there?
Yeah.

1928
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:25,390
I pooped at target.
So apparently they tried to make like a,

1929
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:30,590
an ape pregnant with human sperm and 
tried to do it.

1930
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,570
And the 19 twenties,
but it didn't work.

1931
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:35,630
Doing using artificial insemination.
They were trying to do it.

1932
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:39,110
Fox,
what if they did you know what,

1933
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,930
if there was some real island of Doctor 
Moreau shit out there.

1934
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,640
This is half human.
Half Champ.

1935
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,680
Yeah,
I'd be okay with that.

1936
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:48,050
Would you be okay with like taking a 
trip to go watch them?

1937
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,160
Security like machine guns,
Israeli Mossad.

1938
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,300
How about that?
Okay.

1939
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,610
But I'm saying he's not walking around 
the grounds like,

1940
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:57,920
uh,
like he's parsed part owner of the place

1941
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:02,240
that he's not treated like an equal as a
think of giant plexiglass wall.

1942
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:07,390
Watching from watching them that way.
Not like having to hate you and hate 

1943
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:07,640
you.
You made a half a monkey.

1944
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:10,200
Chimps are mean as fuck.
And people,

1945
01:27:10,201 --> 01:27:12,240
I mean is fuck fly.

1946
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:17,510
He's half dog,
half human.

1947
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,350
That was a great movie.
Yeah,

1948
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:22,400
I said it again.
They kept it alive.

1949
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:23,870
That's what I already have a different 
makeup.

1950
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,290
That was a remake.
Jeff Goldblum was a bad motherfucker.

1951
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,230
He was such a bad motherfucker that you 
talk about his version of the fly,

1952
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:35,590
you know,
it's like you've talked about 

1953
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:36,581
Frankenstein.
You go all the way back to launch 

1954
01:27:36,581 --> 01:27:36,581
Cheney,
you know y'all Boris Karloff don't go to

1955
01:27:36,581 --> 01:27:36,620
the new one.
Yeah,

1956
01:27:36,621 --> 01:27:40,670
you don't go into a fucking hero.
You go to Boris Karloff Frankenstein,

1957
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,450
the flathead and the bolts and shit.
That's what Frankenstein's fucking looks

1958
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:47,460
like.
But not with the fly.

1959
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,650
The fly.
Go with Jeff Gold.

1960
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,450
Not The black and white one.
He nailed it.

1961
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,050
He was so creepy.
He was so good.

1962
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,300
That was when he was young.
He was a shut in his life.

1963
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,410
Yeah,
he was an animal man.

1964
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:02,030
He only wanted to do his hot girlfriend.
Whatever reason.

1965
01:28:02,031 --> 01:28:03,800
Gina Davis,
Gina Davis,

1966
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,390
you remember when he would,
um,

1967
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:10,450
he got fucked up.
Like he was becoming more and more of 

1968
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:12,771
the fly.
So we started going out to places and 

1969
01:28:12,771 --> 01:28:12,920
fucking with people and wrestling with 
dudes.

1970
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:16,880
He break his arm back.
He's twitching and shit and fucking like

1971
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:21,881
crazy.
And he impregnated her fly thing with 

1972
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:23,690
member know what happened.
I don't know.

1973
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:25,310
I think,
I don't think it lived.

1974
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:30,311
I mean I think she probably an abortion 
or something or the end of the movie 

1975
01:28:30,311 --> 01:28:30,311
ended.
I don't remember.

1976
01:28:30,311 --> 01:28:34,481
I haven't seen it in like 10 years,
but I remember it was fucking awesome 

1977
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:37,781
movie because I was always like,
I would always watch star trek and the 

1978
01:28:37,781 --> 01:28:42,060
beam up part,
you know Captain Kirk owns the original 

1979
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,270
and you know when Scotty beam me up and 
they will all of a sudden you.

1980
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:44,840
I'm like,
wow,

1981
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:49,841
they're going to do that some day,
some day they're going to be able to 

1982
01:28:49,841 --> 01:28:49,841
make you disappear and then reappear 
somewhere.

1983
01:28:49,841 --> 01:28:50,540
Yeah,
but remember,

1984
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:53,930
every now and then there'd be some fuck 
ups and someone would come out dead.

1985
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,080
They would come out with all fucked up 
from the trends or the transport them to

1986
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:01,290
know,
to know coordinates in route.

1987
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,550
You just stuck in space flying around.
Yeah.

1988
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,720
It's amazing.
I used to do those things,

1989
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:09,270
but with the next generation where they 
set up and let go,

1990
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:12,020
always phase has already been like it's 
been fired.

1991
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,390
They're like,
oh,

1992
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:14,010
disable it.
Like they were about to kill somebody on

1993
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:14,940
the surface.
Right,

1994
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:15,600
right,
right.

1995
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:17,850
Yeah.
The,

1996
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:22,870
the idea that stores,
what are they being the end of this 

1997
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:22,870
table.
You know,

1998
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:24,360
what's really stupid about the next 
generation?

1999
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,400
No Internet.
They all had fucking.

2000
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,780
They all had ipads.
I bads.

2001
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,160
Yeah.
Then ipads,

2002
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:35,190
ipads.
He didn't know what it was back then.

2003
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:40,370
Did he go online ever?
He did something with it and I'm like 

2004
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:40,680
this just kind of like the remote 
control for the ship.

2005
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:43,740
I thought in his quarters.
In his quarters he.

2006
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,070
Yeah,
he was a good read on stuff.

2007
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:52,150
Oh,
he could read on that before the actual 

2008
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:52,640
ipad.
Oh Wow.

2009
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,730
I wonder if that's what they got the 
idea.

2010
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:58,731
I'm just remembering this now.
I do not remember ever seeing anybody 

2011
01:29:58,731 --> 01:30:02,781
going online,
but I guess that would be implied if 

2012
01:30:02,781 --> 01:30:02,781
their funding was on tap.
Yeah.

2013
01:30:02,781 --> 01:30:03,790
Here's Picard's IPAD.
Yeah,

2014
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:04,890
but that's not.
Not.

2015
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:06,150
Not to email.

2016
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:12,450
What year was this?
This is fucking 90.

2017
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:15,300
Maybe before I understand that.
No,

2018
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,130
no,
not 90.

2019
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:19,300
Is that a book or is that an actual 
extensive tablet?

2020
01:30:19,301 --> 01:30:23,250
A tablet.
Have we been able to access any of those

2021
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:28,251
records?
We did do this stupid goggles on and 

2022
01:30:28,251 --> 01:30:31,941
Maddy,
you're telling me you can fly to other 

2023
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:31,941
planets.
You making me wear this shit?

2024
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:36,120
Definitely not past like 94 95 and he's 
got the smart cover on the back of it.

2025
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:38,010
You can tell.
That doesn't even make sense.

2026
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,280
Well,
I've been so wise is to see that coming.

2027
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,840
Oh,
because it's so obvious,

2028
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,780
but do you see it at all to get to see 
it?

2029
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:50,860
No.
You don't see the height it very 

2030
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:50,860
cleverly that because they haven't 
invented it yet.

2031
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,670
Does apple owe them money?
Because it seems like they invented that

2032
01:30:53,671 --> 01:30:58,671
shit.
Seems like I'm stealing a bunch of shit 

2033
01:30:58,671 --> 01:30:58,671
from people.

2034
01:30:58,671 --> 01:31:01,250
Have you guys noticed,
I'm starting to notice this trend that 

2035
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,910
apple since steve jobs left starting to 
fuck up a little.

2036
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:05,130
What do you mean?
They definitely learned new things.

2037
01:31:05,131 --> 01:31:08,700
They're doing the new maps.
Thanks Steve Jobs never would have never

2038
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:13,701
let that stay.
He never would have let that go on his 

2039
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:13,860
watch and everybody.
Now it's like keeps messing up.

2040
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:16,460
Like the iphone five ain't that much 
better than the forest.

2041
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:21,470
I like the screen size.
A little bigger screen size and you're 

2042
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:22,530
given a battery.
What do you expect it to have?

2043
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:28,160
You give?
You're giving a better life for their 

2044
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:28,410
daily five is way worse.
Yes,

2045
01:31:28,411 --> 01:31:30,870
it is.
Hold on,

2046
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:31,560
hold on,
hold on.

2047
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:33,900
This is silly.
We can't say that more than twice.

2048
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,010
You got to stop there or people will 
fucking switch to the Jaguar show.

2049
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:44,430
Everyone's complaining about it.
A battery life,

2050
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:49,580
but it's not.
It doesn't really do anything better 

2051
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:49,580
than the iphone,
Florida.

2052
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,220
It did for us.
I mean there's only so much you can do.

2053
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,420
There's nothing.
There's no.

2054
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:54,750
Don't release this brand new thing like 
it's the newest.

2055
01:31:56,120 --> 01:32:01,120
Okay.
What you're doing though is sticking up 

2056
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:01,990
for apple no matter because people are 
not that much better.

2057
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,900
I enjoy a bigger screen.
I enjoy the four g lte.

2058
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,830
I enjoy the faster internet.
I enjoy all of the better camera.

2059
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,170
I enjoy it.
I use the phone more than I use anything

2060
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:20,330
in anything more than anything I own.
I use my phone

2061
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:22,860
the most.
Is that much better than the forest.

2062
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:27,950
So you have the talk and capabilities 
and then what else for us both support.

2063
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:33,010
You get faster Internet.
Well there's a lot of capital.

2064
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,280
Well,
the I,

2065
01:32:34,281 --> 01:32:38,970
I feel sucky,
still can't use it with her cover letter

2066
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:44,280
cover.
You cover this cover is the shit I got 

2067
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,210
to cover that slides out so it clips 
onto my pockets.

2068
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:47,680
I never lose it and I can just get a 
wide hole big enough.

2069
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:53,220
Why'd you buy the cheap ones that you 
get for like the whole wants to.

2070
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,290
They're all messed up.
So good.

2071
01:32:56,291 --> 01:33:01,291
And the overwhelming consensus says that
the iphone five battery life is way 

2072
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:06,541
worse than the iphone four.
It seems like they're doing major 

2073
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:07,410
complaints.
Brought a lot of complaints online.

2074
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:13,040
Oh,
people that have actually tested it and 

2075
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:13,160
it's supposed to have the same

2076
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:14,180
battery.
Well,

2077
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:15,550
the issue,
first of all,

2078
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:16,360
the issue,
uh,

2079
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,560
with verizon is the lte.
When you're on the lte.

2080
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:23,260
Look,
if you use any internet on the lte,

2081
01:33:23,261 --> 01:33:28,261
that shit will burn battery stuff.
Burns it ltd on my 10 son of a bitch.

2082
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:32,500
Um,
it's okay.

2083
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,660
It's definitely worse.
Battery life.

2084
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,720
I guess it's a better camera.
That's doesn't inspire me as much.

2085
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,630
Yeah,
there's like,

2086
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:41,380
there's something good to it.
It's a good camera when people ask me if

2087
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:42,040
they should get it,
I'm like,

2088
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:47,070
yeah,
I mean you don't need it if you really 

2089
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:47,070
need a phone,
but don't upgrade isn't worth that much.

2090
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:48,470
So here's the,

2091
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,460
here's the actual Gizmodo,
a battery life for the iphone five,

2092
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:57,110
iphone four s and for a,
it's pretty much out of here.

2093
01:33:57,111 --> 01:33:58,840
You,
uh,

2094
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,520
it's a pop up,
about eight hours.

2095
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:03,220
Talk for the five,
the four ss,

2096
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:05,390
eight hours talk.
The four is seven.

2097
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:08,870
And then for the iphone five for on the 
web is eight hours.

2098
01:34:08,871 --> 01:34:10,610
The four es,
six hours,

2099
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,920
uh,
and the iphone four is six hours.

2100
01:34:12,921 --> 01:34:15,920
And then maybe it's because it keeps 
searching for the Wifi,

2101
01:34:15,921 --> 01:34:18,080
it's 10 to nine.
I'm telling you right now,

2102
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:23,260
know exactly what it is.
Is your apartment sucks for any kind of 

2103
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:23,260
service?

2104
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:24,000
Yeah,
but even when I'm out I,

2105
01:34:24,001 --> 01:34:26,380
it goes down faster,
but my apartment.

2106
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:29,870
Here's the,
here's another issue.

2107
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:31,840
The same with the four in the forest.
And hold on,

2108
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,540
there's an apple update.
Have you,

2109
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:38,470
or if you've been updating your phone,
do you update your address for optics?

2110
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:40,430
But do you do it?
Do you have whenever that.

2111
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:41,760
Okay.
Because uh,

2112
01:34:41,761 --> 01:34:46,761
there was an update to update,
made a significant impact on the 

2113
01:34:46,761 --> 01:34:48,570
batteries already lives in a place I 
lived there with the four.

2114
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,880
Yeah.
But that I wouldn't notice a difference.

2115
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:52,540
You are still in the same spot 
connecting

2116
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:57,540
to a different network or connecting to 
lte instead of connecting to the older 

2117
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:59,540
three.
G meaning there's three g everywhere.

2118
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:04,750
There's not as much lte everywhere.
If you take your phone off lte and put 

2119
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:08,861
it on three g,
then you'll have the similar battery 

2120
01:35:08,861 --> 01:35:11,321
life,
but you're living in a place where it's 

2121
01:35:11,321 --> 01:35:11,321
constantly searching for

2122
01:35:11,321 --> 01:35:12,000
la though.
Even when I go out though,

2123
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:12,460
it does.
Uh,

2124
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:13,480
I,
uh,

2125
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:16,800
I have to take what I said back is 
actually the Ios.

2126
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:20,400
It was killing the IPAD.
I guess it is.

2127
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:21,260
Okay.
No,

2128
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:23,760
it is iphone five,
iphone five and ipad mini.

2129
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:26,250
They were both having a problem with Ios
six point.

2130
01:35:26,251 --> 01:35:28,060
Oh two.
And it was a,

2131
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:33,750
it was a killing the battery life that I
never changed right away.

2132
01:35:33,751 --> 01:35:37,080
I always let some shit sit out there for
awhile when people start complaining and

2133
01:35:37,081 --> 01:35:39,200
then they fix it.
And then you can get it.

2134
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:42,390
I do find it amazing though.
It just seemed more fuck in the system.

2135
01:35:42,391 --> 01:35:47,391
I'm finding amazing.
They're constantly coming up with new 

2136
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:47,391
shit.
I mean,

2137
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:47,460
I think it's a,
it's incredible.

2138
01:35:47,461 --> 01:35:49,350
And I think the iphone five,
even though it's not,

2139
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:54,470
it's not perfect.
I think we're being a bunch of whiny 

2140
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,470
cons.

2141
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:55,230
It's still a fucking amazing phone.
It's amazing.

2142
01:35:55,231 --> 01:35:56,520
I mean five years ago,
I mean,

2143
01:35:56,521 --> 01:35:59,460
this thing I do,
I conduct so much business from this.

2144
01:35:59,461 --> 01:36:00,500
I tweet,
you know,

2145
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:02,670
I,
I call my management.

2146
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,570
For us it's better,
it's faster,

2147
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:08,250
it's faster,
it gets,

2148
01:36:08,251 --> 01:36:09,810
it gets like image.
Like you know what?

2149
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:14,811
I really see it when people send me 
images or if they said because people 

2150
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:18,621
will send me like a little video strip 
prove I can actually improve them on my 

2151
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:21,810
igert.
Like go like when we're doing log into 

2152
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,620
that anymore.
We were doing some stuff with my standup

2153
01:36:22,621 --> 01:36:27,621
special.
They would send me some clips and I 

2154
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:27,960
could just put on my earphones press 
that I could download three,

2155
01:36:27,961 --> 01:36:32,961
four megabytes on an email attachment 
like that with lte and watch it.

2156
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,580
It's way faster than just regular three 
g,

2157
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:40,581
it's just way faster.
Something that would take like four 

2158
01:36:40,581 --> 01:36:40,581
times as long and I'm not even exactly

2159
01:36:40,581 --> 01:36:42,830
and it's a great hot spot.
Like when I have my,

2160
01:36:42,831 --> 01:36:44,650
like my,
my ipad mini,

2161
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,290
like I can just sit there and turn on my
hot hotspot.

2162
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:52,320
Now I have four g lte,
which is like Dsl or faster Internet on 

2163
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,500
my ipad.
So it's great for hotspotting to you.

2164
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:57,250
It's the network bands is a huge deal

2165
01:36:57,410 --> 01:37:02,410
when it comes to getting online or when 
it comes to looking at movies or even 

2166
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:03,570
looking at pictures.
You can't fuck with those.

2167
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,910
Those galaxies,
those android phones,

2168
01:37:05,911 --> 01:37:09,540
those giant galaxies.
Their screens are fucking huge.

2169
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:11,700
Huh?
They have the Samsung Galaxy s three and

2170
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,100
the galaxy note and the galaxy.

2171
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:19,420
This is the way to go the seven inch 
ipad because if you're going to look at 

2172
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:22,901
anything,
why don't you do it on this one of the 

2173
01:37:22,901 --> 01:37:24,470
bigger fits in your pocket,
unless you get a painter's pants back.

2174
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,780
Maybe paid painter's pants.

2175
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,920
Yeah.
Can I go get you a car?

2176
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:32,220
I used to wear cargo pants when I did.
Fear factor when you wore cargo pants.

2177
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:34,020
I remember those days when you wore 
those pants.

2178
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:37,320
Oh,
what the hell,

2179
01:37:37,321 --> 01:37:37,590
man?

2180
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:43,750
Uh,
so you count on the old iphone four is 

2181
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:43,750
you can't go on the lte.
Huh?

2182
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:47,140
The four s's go four G,
which is slowly with atnt.

2183
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:50,760
Yeah.
With 18 t only with verizon four g lte.

2184
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:52,260
He is faster than that.

2185
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:54,650
Do you?
Um,

2186
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,680
do they the

2187
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,840
phone version of the IPAD mini yet?
Or?

2188
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:01,580
It works.
It gets on.

2189
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:04,620
So when my phone says lte and when it 
says four G,

2190
01:38:04,621 --> 01:38:06,210
which one's moving faster?
Lte.

2191
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:11,970
Shit.
That's what doesn't get that money is 

2192
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:11,970
potts.
Is that the deal?

2193
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:11,970
Well,
not where you live in,

2194
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:12,420
around Hollywood.
It's right here.

2195
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:17,540
Yeah.
Why would it get it in Hollywood where 

2196
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:17,540
there's a billion people?
Why?

2197
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,010
Why have good service there?
It doesn't make any sense.

2198
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:22,560
It's like Anthony Bourdain is convinced 
that China's going to overtake the earth

2199
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,770
because the,
the,

2200
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:28,850
the,
their work ethic and the way they get 

2201
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:28,850
shit done and how quickly they get shit 
done.

2202
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:28,850
It's like really ever seen anything like
it.

2203
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:34,100
He goes,
you could be out in the middle of a 

2204
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:34,100
fucking massive forest.
No people anywhere in sight.

2205
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,930
Five bars.
It's like,

2206
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:40,940
it's crazy.
You get cell phone signals everywhere 

2207
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:43,131
and they put up a city and like a week 
trying to throw up a city and they're 

2208
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,140
just going crazy over everything.

2209
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,950
Industrious worker ants.
What do they think?

2210
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:51,951
It's like a the world of warcraft where 
you just build up your area and don't 

2211
01:38:51,951 --> 01:38:51,951
attack,
and then when you do attack it,

2212
01:38:51,951 --> 01:38:53,920
like what other people are so 
overwhelmed by?

2213
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:56,580
Well,
if he just came over here on boats would

2214
01:38:56,581 --> 01:39:01,581
be fucked.
If China wanted to destroy the United 

2215
01:39:01,581 --> 01:39:05,120
States,
I'll let us do is get every Chinese 

2216
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,060
person from China come over to America 
and just start walking.

2217
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,050
What are you going to do is walk across 
the entire continent.

2218
01:39:10,051 --> 01:39:11,280
We're going to do it.
You gonna arrest everybody.

2219
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:16,281
You don't have the resources.
They would overwhelm us just by sheer 

2220
01:39:16,281 --> 01:39:19,791
numbers.
How soon before the Chinese Americans 

2221
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:19,791
would say,
fuck it,

2222
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:19,791
let's just torn up.
I can't tell.

2223
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:22,220
They would learn.
Chinese gets some of those folks.

2224
01:39:22,221 --> 01:39:24,210
I wouldn't blame them with those Rosetta
stones.

2225
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:25,980
Have you ever tried to use that?
You ever tried to learn a language?

2226
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:31,180
Um,
if I'm downloading this stuff and 

2227
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:33,270
they've never listened to it many times 
it's very hard.

2228
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:36,090
It's very hard actually.
Speak Hebrew.

2229
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:37,830
I mean,
I can understand a little bit,

2230
01:39:37,831 --> 01:39:39,060
but I can't.
You can't be.

2231
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:40,380
You used to be fluent.
Right?

2232
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:43,410
I can get by basically if you think if 
you went back to Israel,

2233
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:45,110
you would like,
notice how I said that.

2234
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,790
Israel.
I didn't say Israel as Israel.

2235
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:50,110
Israel.
If you went back there with you,

2236
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:51,420
how long would it take,
do you think?

2237
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:54,390
Before you could be fluent again?
I have to leave like Jerusalem.

2238
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:55,980
Oh really?
Why is that?

2239
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:59,040
Because how many English speakers are in
Jerusalem?

2240
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,950
Everybody.
Real.

2241
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:06,010
Oh yeah.
And they're almost all center of town 

2242
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:06,010
and stuff.
Every business owner knows English.

2243
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:07,080
You cannot get by without it.
We really know.

2244
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:08,640
It's just,
it's silly to try not to.

2245
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,060
Is the tourist trade over there big?

2246
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:16,100
What is a fucking tourists director for 
his big potter really hurts him for 

2247
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:16,100
that.
For him to spend some money.

2248
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:18,960
People really took a plummet this most 
recent.

2249
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,780
The Intifada?
Yeah.

2250
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,290
What does,
what does that mean?

2251
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:24,270
Intifada or uprising?
The uprising.

2252
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:26,700
The Palestinian.
Twelve years now.

2253
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:28,230
Okay.
That and that,

2254
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:33,350
that constant threat of violence.
I think it's probably recovered from 

2255
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:34,040
there since the beginnings of it in the 
last few years,

2256
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:39,050
been more peaceful.
If they could just keep a little fake 

2257
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:41,841
violence going on and keep people out,
it's probably a good move in terms of 

2258
01:40:41,841 --> 01:40:44,080
like those people that would go there,
like the Christian missionary types that

2259
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:46,830
settles in the settlements when they're 
lucky to keep building new settlements.

2260
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:49,830
Those are the Americans coming over.
Really the Americans that they're like,

2261
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:54,831
yeah,
we want to help reclaim the land of 

2262
01:40:54,831 --> 01:40:54,831
Israel.
So all those fucking Zionists.

2263
01:40:54,831 --> 01:40:55,000
Whoa.
I go back.

2264
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:58,570
So the Americans come over and they want
to help reclaim Israel.

2265
01:40:58,571 --> 01:41:00,760
So they're settling.
Where in the,

2266
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:06,210
um,
argued lands and whose side are they on 

2267
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:06,820
Israel's.
So they're coming over,

2268
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:08,560
they landed and they want to live in 
Israel.

2269
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:09,880
And guess what?
This is part of Israel.

2270
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,980
And the way we can show that by building
a house right here.

2271
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:17,010
Oh my God,
you're next to someone else's house and 

2272
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:18,940
you have a watchtower and a garden.
So are they American Jews?

2273
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:19,870
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2274
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:22,030
Oh,
so you like s sympathizers,

2275
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:25,690
but you guys put up with is really 
wrong.

2276
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:27,650
I'm going to go over there and support 
there.

2277
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,560
There would be people that would do it 
sort of like,

2278
01:41:29,561 --> 01:41:30,220
you know,
like that.

2279
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:34,080
I'm American talent man character.
The other one guy walk out.

2280
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:36,640
John Walker.
Lynn's I want to say those who went over

2281
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:38,980
there and I've been obsessed with that 
show.

2282
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:41,250
Homeland a really seen that show.
No,

2283
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:46,260
I just downloaded the first season.
It's fucking good and the sector have 

2284
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:50,890
been fucking better and I was not even 
remotely into seeing it until I did,

2285
01:41:50,891 --> 01:41:55,300
but a lot of it revolves around him 
being a prisoner because you hear Claire

2286
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,800
Danes what?
Forget it.

2287
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:58,090
A bitch can act or ask her.
Yeah,

2288
01:41:58,091 --> 01:41:59,890
she's good though.
She can act her ass off.

2289
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,300
I loved her.
My so called life,

2290
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:03,700
I never saw that because I'm a man.
Well,

2291
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:07,590
I was a little boy who sided with her 
and jared leto and how hard.

2292
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,790
It wasn't high school.
Did you really side with them?

2293
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:11,020
Oh yeah.
It definitely hurt.

2294
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:16,021
She was awkward.
It wasn't one of the popular kids just 

2295
01:42:16,021 --> 01:42:16,021
like me,
man.

2296
01:42:16,021 --> 01:42:19,410
Yeah.
Just like she knows what I'm going 

2297
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:19,410
through.
I hear you bro.

2298
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:20,590
I fucking Lido Guy.
What about him?

2299
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:23,180
He was okay because he let he let Claire
Danes be cool with them.

2300
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:28,230
Wow.
Nineteen 68,000.

2301
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:33,100
One a space odyssey.
Love to watch that.

2302
01:42:33,101 --> 01:42:38,101
It's based on.
I see his version of the future is 

2303
01:42:38,101 --> 01:42:38,101
really interesting.
Well,

2304
01:42:38,101 --> 01:42:38,101
they already watched that.
They had.

2305
01:42:38,101 --> 01:42:40,120
I just saw it again recently.
I've only did my taxes last year.

2306
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:45,390
God Damn.
Two thousand one and didn't they have a 

2307
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:47,350
2010 the year we make contact or 
something like that was another one that

2308
01:42:47,351 --> 01:42:48,010
was not cool.
Brooke.

2309
01:42:48,011 --> 01:42:49,750
I don't think it wasn't Kubek.
No,

2310
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,760
I think they just said,
look,

2311
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:52,960
let's keep it out.
Keep it going.

2312
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:54,570
Who the fuck?
Let them do that.

2313
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:57,550
Hollywood like they do everything.
Fucking Twat.

2314
01:42:57,551 --> 01:43:02,551
Bags.
Speaking of Hollywood like they do 

2315
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:02,551
everything.
Steven Spielberg pushed back,

2316
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:02,560
uh,
our friend,

2317
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:05,560
um,
the robot apocalypse guy,

2318
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:07,850
pushback annual h Wilson.
Yay.

2319
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,240
Fucking police were supposed to do that 
movie.

2320
01:43:10,241 --> 01:43:15,241
There were supposed to do the robot 
apocalypse movie and apparently pulled 

2321
01:43:15,241 --> 01:43:15,241
out of it.

2322
01:43:15,241 --> 01:43:16,150
Spielberg did.
Yeah.

2323
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:21,320
You know why?
Because he doesn't want allowed 

2324
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,650
apocalypse and his movies,
his version of the world is everything 

2325
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:22,650
always turns out a.
okay.

2326
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:23,560
Well,
I don't know if it's that.

2327
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:26,080
I mean,
I think it's probably that he's tired.

2328
01:43:26,081 --> 01:43:31,081
The guy just got done doing lincoln.
It was a huge movie that took forever 

2329
01:43:31,081 --> 01:43:31,870
to.
She wasn't going to do an apocalypse.

2330
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:33,020
Well,
you know,

2331
01:43:33,021 --> 01:43:34,390
he's a science.
So science fiction,

2332
01:43:34,391 --> 01:43:36,790
fucking movie dude.
Robot apocalypse.

2333
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,840
How would they get to do that and still 
keep that worldview of like,

2334
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,890
well,
I'll be okay because in the end,

2335
01:43:41,891 --> 01:43:43,940
the good guys probably when.
Oh,

2336
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:49,020
maybe that'd be nice.
So we walk out of there feeling good 

2337
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:49,020
about yourself.
That's good.

2338
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:51,070
So they always hated about his movies.

2339
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,980
Well,
it's really interesting that you say 

2340
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:56,980
that because,
uh,

2341
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:01,270
some of the choices that he made his 
early is early movies you said he would 

2342
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:01,270
never make now.
Like,

2343
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:05,920
yeah,
like in close encounters of the third 

2344
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:05,920
time,
you remember when Richard Dreyfus leaves

2345
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,670
his family to go with the aliens?
He said he would never do that.

2346
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:09,320
Now he would say family's more 
important.

2347
01:44:09,321 --> 01:44:10,680
He's to stay with his family.
Yeah.

2348
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:13,090
That's something a single guy would 
think,

2349
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:18,640
you know,
a single guy with thank fuck these wife 

2350
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:18,640
and kid.
Look,

2351
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:18,640
I love you baby.
But you know,

2352
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:19,370
you're gonna have to take care of that 
kid.

2353
01:44:19,371 --> 01:44:20,710
I'm going off with the aliens.
Yeah,

2354
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:26,230
that wouldn't.
You would be the shittiest fucking 

2355
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:29,291
parent to ever live at.
It's nice enough that you saw the 

2356
01:44:29,291 --> 01:44:29,291
aliens.
Okay.

2357
01:44:29,291 --> 01:44:30,050
You saw him.
You know they exist.

2358
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,630
Thank you for showing yourself to me.

2359
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:34,580
But I'm going to go back to work.
I got I gonna.

2360
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:37,130
What am I going to do that with you?
Why can't my kid.

2361
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:38,900
I'm not.
I'm not going to fucking go fly with you

2362
01:44:38,901 --> 01:44:40,460
to another planet.
That's why.

2363
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:45,461
Would that be good?
You wouldn't even be able to talk to 

2364
01:44:45,461 --> 01:44:45,461
them.
It would be a fucking mess.

2365
01:44:45,461 --> 01:44:49,110
I mean,
thinking about the experiences that he 

2366
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:50,471
had with them in the movie,
it wasn't like they were a bundle of 

2367
01:44:50,471 --> 01:44:50,471
joy.
He's so excited to go with them.

2368
01:44:50,471 --> 01:44:51,470
Why?
Because they have better ipads.

2369
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,560
Different.
What is it?

2370
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:54,950
18.
Gee,

2371
01:44:54,951 --> 01:44:56,090
we got to go.
You know,

2372
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:57,000
what is it?
What?

2373
01:44:57,001 --> 01:45:02,001
Why would they want?
Why the fuck would you want to go and 

2374
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:02,001
party with aliens?
They're little knock into them.

2375
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:06,881
They fall down immediately.
Probably heads crack open because 

2376
01:45:06,881 --> 01:45:07,270
they're these giant heads coming out 
used to violence at all.

2377
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:09,230
They're probably super soft.
You know,

2378
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:11,630
just you could accidentally break them.
I bet.

2379
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:11,790
All

2380
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:16,860
right.
Now all it Spielberg movies were like 

2381
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:16,860
happy endings.
You only wants Schindler's list,

2382
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:18,110
but he did it.
He did.

2383
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:21,690
It was a fucking holocaust movie and he 
still talks about overcoming and meeting

2384
01:45:21,691 --> 01:45:23,310
all these survivors.
Yeah.

2385
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:27,000
He managed to do that no matter what,
but no one left the schindler's list.

2386
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:32,180
That was the great happy.
You think that saving private Ryan was 

2387
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:35,571
cute at the end.
It was kind of sweet at the end with a 

2388
01:45:35,571 --> 01:45:35,930
guy who's got his family there with 
them.

2389
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:40,160
It's all supporting the fact that he's 
spent his life.

2390
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:43,970
Does he fucking goes over stuff and just
rewrite it so that he can.

2391
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,650
I don't remember the twelfth one.
What color?

2392
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:49,380
Purple twilight.
He directed this season,

2393
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,510
but in the end he always makes 
everything okay.

2394
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:56,511
Even fucking the robot movie where he's 
still got to go see his mom one last 

2395
01:45:56,511 --> 01:45:58,830
time.
We'll that a robot movie like I robot or

2396
01:45:58,831 --> 01:45:59,010
something.

2397
01:45:59,170 --> 01:46:00,350
A robot.
You know what?

2398
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,180
He's awesome making known.
The kid replaced.

2399
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:05,730
Why would you make another dressing 
part?

2400
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:08,100
Has the other ones were awesome because 
the other ones don't look.

2401
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:14,420
Look at the old ones.
The old ones on the TV doesn't look so 

2402
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:14,420
great.
Well,

2403
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,380
that's not true.
I just saw Jurassic Park the other day.

2404
01:46:16,381 --> 01:46:18,540
I thought it was fucking great.
Really?

2405
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:22,110
The dentist was looked fake to you.
I remember the first time I saw them,

2406
01:46:22,111 --> 01:46:23,980
I was on the edge of my seat going,
this is amazing.

2407
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:27,210
I saw on TV and it was like,
I didn't think they look fake at all.

2408
01:46:27,211 --> 01:46:32,211
You thought they looked fake.
He's too busy making real steel to who 

2409
01:46:32,211 --> 01:46:33,150
is speaking?
We'll steal one.

2410
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:37,510
Executive producer.
How dairy?

2411
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:41,160
It looked good in the previous real 
steel look.

2412
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:43,170
Good.
I like robots at fight.

2413
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,270
When you taught me he didn't do I am 
legend.

2414
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:46,220
No,
no,

2415
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:49,400
no.
Who was that don't know.

2416
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:49,990
Is that the guy?

2417
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:53,490
Didn't momento no,
he did ai though.

2418
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,370
That's what it was.
That was a good one.

2419
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:56,690
Yeah,
that was a good one.

2420
01:46:56,810 --> 01:46:58,640
I mean he's,
he's a brilliant director,

2421
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,960
but it's kind of interesting.
These guys that uh,

2422
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:04,670
they get older and they just get kind of
softer.

2423
01:47:04,671 --> 01:47:08,150
Like George Lucas or conservative.
It's not just more conservative,

2424
01:47:08,151 --> 01:47:11,460
but they lose their vitality.
There's,

2425
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:15,270
there's no spark inside of their work 
anymore.

2426
01:47:15,271 --> 01:47:17,690
It's so very strange thing that happens 
with some folks.

2427
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,610
It doesn't happen to everybody.
Like with George Carlin,

2428
01:47:19,611 --> 01:47:24,611
it never happened.
That guy was fucking grind and get out 

2429
01:47:24,611 --> 01:47:24,611
to the day he died.
Some guys,

2430
01:47:24,611 --> 01:47:27,980
it doesn't happen.
It's some guys they get better in time.

2431
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:30,440
Clint Terentino's,
he's not slowing down.

2432
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:35,770
That guy is fucking awesome.
That django movie was a real fucking 

2433
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:39,290
movie and with real crazy ass dudes 
eaten by dogs.

2434
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:43,580
Crazy ass fucking movie.
He's not slowing down at all,

2435
01:47:43,581 --> 01:47:44,630
but something happens to.

2436
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:48,470
Some of them were they just becomes 
pausing Lucas.

2437
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:54,070
Here's the worst worst.
You'd go back and we'll watch star wars 

2438
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:58,091
one at the time in the error when I saw 
that was a fucking masterpiece.

2439
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,520
She's peckish now.
It's so cheesy.

2440
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:02,780
Dish and you're like,
what?

2441
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,220
How is that?
Even if I was six,

2442
01:48:04,221 --> 01:48:09,221
I don't think this should be Jonesville 
bad or that the latest one.

2443
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:10,200
Oh,
Dr.

2444
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:11,270
Rayzman.
What about the earlier ones?

2445
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:16,450
The other ones of those early ones are 
great and when he was getting pussy and 

2446
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:17,930
shit,
remember when that girl and kissing each

2447
01:48:17,931 --> 01:48:20,850
other and now he's like an old man.
It's fucking back hurts.

2448
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:22,590
Can't whip the whip.
That good

2449
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:25,430
students were coming onto them.
Snakes.

2450
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,620
It's blinking and the the on the islands
of Britain.

2451
01:48:28,621 --> 01:48:29,610
I love you.

2452
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:33,760
Number.
Short round little Asian kid.

2453
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:37,540
Yeah.
He went from being like the anymore stud

2454
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:41,730
professor guy to be in someone's dad.
You know that.

2455
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,840
That's what happened.
He lost it all.

2456
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:46,000
Somewhere along the line he was like,
someone's who's,

2457
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:50,040
you know,
like Harrison Ford's character was like,

2458
01:48:50,110 --> 01:48:51,580
now he's like someone's Dad.
It's like,

2459
01:48:51,581 --> 01:48:52,630
Oh,
you rascally the kids.

2460
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:57,580
I'm just here to get that crystal scroll
like you back to the early one.

2461
01:48:57,581 --> 01:49:02,581
We had a runaway from fucking giant 
boulders that were set his traps and 

2462
01:49:02,581 --> 01:49:05,410
he's trying to get these artifacts and 
the first one was great and making a new

2463
01:49:05,411 --> 01:49:05,620
one.

2464
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,420
One five,
five.

2465
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:12,520
I'm glad.
At least they got star wars away from 

2466
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:12,520
Lucas.
Yeah,

2467
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:12,870
they gave it to Disney.
What are they going to do with it?

2468
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:17,900
They're going to have.
Maybe rapunzel is going to be in star 

2469
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:17,900
wars.
That's going to have.

2470
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:23,580
Well,
at least the creature could be theater 

2471
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:23,580
like the would be adorable.
Don't you have this idea that like,

2472
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:24,650
well they can't fuck it up,
this,

2473
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:26,430
this thing.
They can't mess it up completely,

2474
01:49:26,431 --> 01:49:27,240
but then you realize like,
no,

2475
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:29,250
just property to somebody.
They can do whatever they want to.

2476
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:31,140
They could ever puzzle in there.
Yeah.

2477
01:49:31,141 --> 01:49:36,141
Why not?
They could do whatever the fuck they 

2478
01:49:36,141 --> 01:49:36,141
wanted and be fine.
There's nothing we could do about it.

2479
01:49:36,141 --> 01:49:40,310
I'm worried about Pixar lost in star 
wars with flying to the galaxy and 

2480
01:49:43,981 --> 01:49:47,470
they're just going to Indiana Jones 
popping out of their fucking helmets.

2481
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:55,440
You Imagine?
Yoda gets together with Mickey and 

2482
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:58,171
teaches.
Mickey had a fight and then it's like 

2483
01:49:58,171 --> 01:49:58,171
the first one.
When was the,

2484
01:49:58,171 --> 01:50:02,191
uh,
the sword was the sorcerer in his 

2485
01:50:02,191 --> 01:50:02,191
apprentice?
Sorcerer's apprentice.

2486
01:50:02,191 --> 01:50:02,191
Was that as,
um,

2487
01:50:02,191 --> 01:50:04,060
the Mickey Mouse one?
Oh yeah.

2488
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,020
Sorcerer's apprentice,
I think.

2489
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:06,220
Yeah.
That was that what it's called?

2490
01:50:06,221 --> 01:50:08,110
Fantasia.
Fantasia musical.

2491
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:13,170
Yeah.
It was fucking amazing little piece of 

2492
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:13,170
work.
But I mean,

2493
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:13,420
it's essentially,
you know,

2494
01:50:13,421 --> 01:50:17,350
about a magician's apprentice who fucks 
up and everything goes terribly wrong.

2495
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,540
Right?
Isn't that what it does really?

2496
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:20,440
It's just like,
look at what we can do now.

2497
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:24,880
Look at where we can go.
How could that be any different?

2498
01:50:24,881 --> 01:50:27,640
If he was hanging out with Yoda,
if he was hanging out with Yoda and it'd

2499
01:50:27,641 --> 01:50:29,080
be like very simple,
you know,

2500
01:50:29,081 --> 01:50:30,820
like he would.
Yoda would tell him,

2501
01:50:30,821 --> 01:50:32,260
you know,
to force,

2502
01:50:32,261 --> 01:50:34,840
you must,
and then he would go off and fuck up and

2503
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:35,990
turn everything into a river.

2504
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:41,240
It's the same.
Add Yoga or add yoga.

2505
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:46,320
Yoga a Yogi man.
Dude.

2506
01:50:47,801 --> 01:50:50,170
Yoga is like some ancient Hindu 
wrestling.

2507
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,740
A stretches are.
Yeah.

2508
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,510
I've heard of that.
You're holding poses.

2509
01:50:56,360 --> 01:51:01,360
I'm going to get rolfed tomorrow.
What does that have a bulging disc in my

2510
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:03,030
back.
I have a back issue or my,

2511
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:08,080
my.
I've had a back injury that have 

2512
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:08,100
reoccurred so many times that the disc 
is starting to uh,

2513
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:11,350
get inflamed and they're like slightly 
protrudes.

2514
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,430
Failing.
Yeah.

2515
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:13,720
Not,
not too bad.

2516
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:15,670
It's not like I don't need surgery or 
anything like that,

2517
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,000
but one of the things they do to relax 
attention to areas of sin called Raul 

2518
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,351
thing,
which is supposed to be like a lot like 

2519
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:25,730
getting raped by pliers.
Sounds off or what do they do?

2520
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:29,680
Rip Your fucking skin apart.
It tear your muscle away from your bone.

2521
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:32,080
Smash it and rip it apart.

2522
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:37,080
Yeah.
I suppose nothing like painful it 

2523
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:37,080
rebuild fl.
Rolfing.

2524
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,490
Ruffling what's ruffling.
Rolling on the floor laughing.

2525
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:44,970
Oh,
do well if you guys heard of that 

2526
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:48,440
letter,
the less have you heard of us or being 

2527
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:48,440
big.
What does that,

2528
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:51,730
that sport where they get in a giant 
ball and they roll with it.

2529
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:52,880
Something.
Just dive in that right?

2530
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:56,590
It's just two Russian guys off a fucking
cliff.

2531
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:57,760
Wow,
dude.

2532
01:51:57,761 --> 01:51:59,740
There's a video of it by going off the 
cliff.

2533
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:04,770
Si Senor Brian.
I think it's called absorbing a giant 

2534
01:52:05,381 --> 01:52:06,640
ball.
Hold on.

2535
01:52:06,641 --> 01:52:10,860
Guy Dies absorbing.
Let me say this,

2536
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:12,880
but Wayne Coyne does,
and the flaming lips concepts.

2537
01:52:12,881 --> 01:52:15,610
He walked into the crowd.
As long as he doesn't do that.

2538
01:52:15,611 --> 01:52:17,700
Yeah,
it's scary.

2539
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:20,190
It's so scary,
but it up.

2540
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:22,990
Don't just share it yourself.
Yeah.

2541
01:52:22,991 --> 01:52:24,400
The Internet here sucks.
The fat one,

2542
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:26,740
but only mobile mode only for another 
month.

2543
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:30,080
Speaking of Internet,
my special passive aggressive.

2544
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:34,800
We have available for presale fast.
She'll dot com.

2545
01:52:35,570 --> 01:52:38,440
It'll be available tomorrow on for 
Presale Presale,

2546
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,140
and when does it sale?
I think February fifth.

2547
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:41,640
Oh,
okay.

2548
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:44,710
So they have to just hold their dicks 
for two weeks.

2549
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:50,050
That's 20 percent off.
We look at this fear.

2550
01:52:50,341 --> 01:52:51,390
Worst Marketer ever 20th.

2551
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:56,320
This was supposed to be a thrilling ride
down,

2552
01:52:56,321 --> 01:53:00,670
a ski slope,
inflatable ball ended in tragedy for the

2553
01:53:00,671 --> 01:53:03,310
to Russia and men inside.
One of them died.

2554
01:53:03,311 --> 01:53:05,770
The other was badly injured when the 
absorb,

2555
01:53:05,771 --> 01:53:10,771
as the transparent globe is called,
veered off course and went over a cliff 

2556
01:53:10,771 --> 01:53:13,870
in the Caucasus mountains.
This video shows they're terrifying.

2557
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:18,871
Ride.
At one point the man recording the 

2558
01:53:18,871 --> 01:53:21,541
footage can be heard,
telling people the ball won't roll away 

2559
01:53:21,541 --> 01:53:21,541
and that everything's gonna.
Be Okay,

2560
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:26,910
but eventually the ball did roll to a 
Rocky Ledge and bounced over at going 

2561
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:29,110
down the side of the mountain,
but it's really fast absorbing.

2562
01:53:29,111 --> 01:53:33,280
Started in the 19 nineties in New 
Zealand at is now done around the world.

2563
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:38,790
This accident has prompted the head of 
Russia's emergency rescue services to 

2564
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:42,631
demand that safety rules for winter 
sports being forced into the big move.

2565
01:53:43,090 --> 01:53:45,790
That's a big move.
And forest winter safety rules.

2566
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:52,710
We have rules for fun in the last shy.
You can just get in bowling.

2567
01:53:53,370 --> 01:53:58,370
Golf cleats to mix us.
Bad Russians don't really smile.

2568
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:03,140
They did say do fade or smiles.
There's a Russian.

2569
01:54:03,141 --> 01:54:08,141
I wouldn't have a dick and I'm okay.
You're going to have to deal with that 

2570
01:54:08,901 --> 01:54:10,580
one.
Russian use,

2571
01:54:10,581 --> 01:54:12,680
Bungee cord.
Heisman Bungee Bun,

2572
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:14,020
g,
G,

2573
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:16,280
or a J.
G,

2574
01:54:16,281 --> 01:54:16,780
e

2575
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:20,590
cord off roof.
Here's the.

2576
01:54:22,610 --> 01:54:23,750
Oh,
you don't need to see a man.

2577
01:54:23,751 --> 01:54:24,770
It's a sadness.

2578
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:28,780
The other one's trapped with the other 
one.

2579
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:33,590
Dead like he fell.
You're bouncing like that.

2580
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,530
You're clashing heads.
He yells.

2581
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:40,180
Don't say those people are going to be 
fine.

2582
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:45,190
Don't worry.
Look at the city,

2583
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:53,120
and that's when they realized that I'm 
sure has a stroke.

2584
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:56,310
It's going down that cliff.
That's it.

2585
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:00,290
Black.
Oh my God.

2586
01:55:00,291 --> 01:55:01,460
Look at it.
Hit those rocks.

2587
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:04,880
Boom,
boom,

2588
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:06,560
boom.
Oh my God.

2589
01:55:06,561 --> 01:55:07,070
Your Dad.

2590
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:12,900
Shit.
One of the other had to be alive with a 

2591
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:16,100
friend next to him.
Still rolling down a hill and still 

2592
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,330
probably having a little bit funky 
unconscious to Brian.

2593
01:55:18,331 --> 01:55:20,460
Look up because the last part was like,
oh yeah,

2594
01:55:20,461 --> 01:55:22,760
yeah.
We can look up Russian

2595
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:27,790
kids with a death wish.
Bungee Russian kids with a death wish.

2596
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:34,210
Bungee WII U N G E B U N G U P and 
again,

2597
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:36,690
get your Dick Check,
son.

2598
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:39,470
His Shit's broken.
You can't hold your mud.

2599
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:41,480
Get me one of those.
A coconut waters.

2600
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:42,790
Oh,
coconut waters.

2601
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:43,770
Jealousy to.
Oh,

2602
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:43,970
well,

2603
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,240
they're our favorite.
Bryan.

2604
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:47,010
In fact,
they're so good.

2605
01:55:47,011 --> 01:55:49,980
They make other coconut water.
Tastes like toilet water.

2606
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:55,100
I agree with that.
I can't even buy that other shit that 

2607
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:55,560
you get in a fucking carton.
That nonsense.

2608
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:57,670
Whatever it is.
I do not like it with the Puck,

2609
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,450
but that's my own personal.
Then I don't mind the pub.

2610
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,730
The pub makes me feel like it's real.
Yeah,

2611
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:07,731
I'm alive.
You know what I drank as a juice that I 

2612
01:56:07,731 --> 01:56:08,370
just found out was a Jew as a juice 
juice as a drink.

2613
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,290
I drank the uh,
you know,

2614
01:56:09,490 --> 01:56:12,840
behind go behind the bar.
And you had the tap for orange juice.

2615
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,110
I've been drinking that by the glass 
pool thinking it was real juice.

2616
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:21,170
No,
it turns out it's just some chemicals 

2617
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:21,170
and water.
Yeah.

2618
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:21,410
He needs to.
Dude.

2619
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:28,430
Tap your kid in a decade.
You're the kid that went to Mcdonald's 

2620
01:56:28,921 --> 01:56:30,450
at that orange drink.
Orange juice.

2621
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:32,190
No,
go for me guys.

2622
01:56:32,191 --> 01:56:33,900
I'm going healthy.
Just give me some of that other stuff.

2623
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:35,630
Don't you know anything about 
fermentation?

2624
01:56:35,650 --> 01:56:37,110
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

2625
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:40,570
Just finding this out.
This is the kids.

2626
01:56:40,571 --> 01:56:41,550
These are the Russian kids.

2627
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:42,750
They.
They made a fake.

2628
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:47,190
They made their own bungee jump.
Bungee cord tied into this bitch.

2629
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:50,310
Watch this.
Put the headphones on.

2630
01:56:50,311 --> 01:56:51,050
Duty.
You got to hear that.

2631
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:54,480
I'm not telling you.
Look it up.

2632
01:56:54,481 --> 01:56:55,370
Crazy.
These kids are.

2633
01:56:55,580 --> 01:57:00,580
They're holding onto this rope.
They tied it to a chimney slider out 

2634
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:08,810
through the bottoms of smashing in the 
building.

2635
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:15,860
They haven't controlled this.
Haven't thought this through right now.

2636
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:17,720
How did they get her back up?
Wow.

2637
01:57:17,721 --> 01:57:19,380
I barely do.
They kind of let her down.

2638
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,350
She's hanging.
They're hanging onto her,

2639
01:57:22,351 --> 01:57:24,660
so they sought slowly let her down.
They're holding it.

2640
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:25,500
Yes.
Jude,

2641
01:57:25,501 --> 01:57:28,220
Russians are crazy.
Weight related.

2642
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,780
Video related video.
Andrew dice clay.

2643
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:35,670
What is up with this backflip fair?

2644
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:39,880
I watched a dices,
a showtime special.

2645
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,210
It was very funny.
It was very funny what's going on here,

2646
01:57:43,211 --> 01:57:45,090
but backflip fail.
But she's in a phone.

2647
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:47,380
No backflip fail.
Let's see what goes on here.

2648
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,030
A bridge?
Yeah,

2649
01:57:49,031 --> 01:57:51,310
right when she's about to do it.
A dude behind her.

2650
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:54,910
Sister,
she starts her,

2651
01:57:54,911 --> 01:57:55,810
period.
You grow.

2652
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:59,780
Your sister's hotter than you.
Oh Wow.

2653
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,570
Look how beautiful that is.
Man.

2654
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,360
That looks like Canada and the side.
That looks fantastic.

2655
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:05,970
Oh No.
This girl's not going to do what I think

2656
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:10,980
she's going to do.
Is this like off a cliff or some shit 

2657
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:10,980
off of bridge?
Oh No,

2658
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:11,070
don't,
don't,

2659
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:11,820
don't,
don't,

2660
01:58:11,821 --> 01:58:14,530
don't do this.
Oh my God.

2661
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:15,950
Oh,
don't do this.

2662
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:20,680
Oh,
you fucking assholes.

2663
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,970
Put that video up.
But she was pregnant and

2664
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:27,220
she has.
She missed thing.

2665
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:32,380
You know?
That's basically the bit that I do on 

2666
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:35,681
stage when I talk about Mr Han's,
like when someone's sent me that first 

2667
01:58:35,681 --> 01:58:36,410
video,
this is exactly the feeling you get.

2668
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:37,550
Like when?
When Brian,

2669
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:39,560
remember when I'm coming to your place 
and you showed me two girls,

2670
01:58:39,561 --> 01:58:42,010
one cup the first time it hits you in

2671
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,090
the bone,
you can't.

2672
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,410
You like,
what's next?

2673
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:49,590
The fuck is gonna happen here and how 
many times you've seen someone do 

2674
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:50,930
something like that and then just die.
I mean a bunch.

2675
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:56,390
I've seen a bunch of people just to get 
disintegrated in car accidents and flip 

2676
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:58,540
over Atlanta their fucking head in a 
puddle of blood and raw.

2677
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:00,730
I saw videos of people run over by 
trucks.

2678
01:59:00,731 --> 01:59:05,731
I've seen everything I've seen way more 
than the average person by the age of,

2679
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:07,180
you know,
whatever.

2680
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:10,780
100 would have seen if they lived 20 
years ago.

2681
01:59:11,710 --> 01:59:14,530
Oh yeah.
Way More online with that.

2682
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,890
And you've seen countless more get those
experiences.

2683
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:20,850
Yeah.
Same people being beheaded them.

2684
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,660
Oh,
I like not.

2685
01:59:22,661 --> 01:59:27,661
I don't like,
but they don't just chop their heads 

2686
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:30,781
off.
They cut them slowly off so they're 

2687
01:59:30,781 --> 01:59:30,781
screaming and making a lot of grass.
There.

2688
01:59:30,781 --> 01:59:35,341
Head is getting cut off.
Well that was the most fucked up thing 

2689
01:59:35,341 --> 01:59:38,461
about when they.
When they first caught that American 

2690
01:59:38,461 --> 01:59:38,461
perlman or something.
Yeah.

2691
01:59:38,461 --> 01:59:39,670
Daniel Perlman maybe.
Yeah.

2692
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:43,570
When they first did that to him and then
they showed them actually doing it.

2693
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:44,650
No Way.

2694
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:47,310
Oh my God,
look at this kid.

2695
01:59:48,030 --> 01:59:51,370
Oh my Lord.
Look at what he's doing now.

2696
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:53,790
He's doing pushups.
He's doing chin ups,

2697
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:57,480
like in space and he's doing it.
It's a thick bar.

2698
01:59:57,481 --> 02:00:00,750
He's hanging onto to,
oh my God,

2699
02:00:00,751 --> 02:00:03,230
this kid is scary and he's.
He's doing awesome self.

2700
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,490
I'll just kid bad enough.
Fall.

2701
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,450
Please don't tell me what.
Where is his mother?

2702
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:11,700
Yeah,
this kid is crazy.

2703
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,800
How's he up there?
He's up there.

2704
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,020
What's the.
What's the video game?

2705
02:00:18,021 --> 02:00:23,021
You got to stab people swinging castles,
touching himself and landing on the bar 

2706
02:00:23,121 --> 02:00:28,121
again and just having confidence that he
can support himself with his monkey 

2707
02:00:28,121 --> 02:00:30,230
hands.
Andrew dice clay comes up again.

2708
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:35,150
No,
the

2709
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:39,150
know that you're into is special.
He yelled at a woman for laughing in the

2710
02:00:39,151 --> 02:00:41,540
wrong place.
She was laughing though.

2711
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:46,550
What the fuck you doing?
You're ruining my daughter in the wrong 

2712
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:50,010
spot.
It's so ridiculous.

2713
02:00:50,730 --> 02:00:55,730
It's like his character to me,
especially because I know him know his 

2714
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:56,910
character.
Me because like if you didn't know him,

2715
02:00:56,911 --> 02:00:58,890
you think he's making movies like a 
really a mean guy,

2716
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:00,560
but he's not a mean guy at all.
He's,

2717
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:01,810
he's a nice guy.
He's just.

2718
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:03,450
He's just,
he's crazy.

2719
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,120
He's crazy.
But he's not like.

2720
02:01:05,190 --> 02:01:10,190
He likes to fuck her.
People likes to fuck with the practical 

2721
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:10,190
joker,
but his comedy,

2722
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:11,310
because I know him,
it's like I dunno,

2723
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:14,910
it's like twice as funny.
Ridiculous on purpose.

2724
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:20,090
Like we went to see him in Vegas and he 
was so pickled that me and Norton and 

2725
02:01:20,090 --> 02:01:24,621
Bobby Kelly came backstage and you just 
come back to the states and Anthony 

2726
02:01:24,621 --> 02:01:28,080
Kumina and later we were so happy to see
him and he was so happy that people came

2727
02:01:28,081 --> 02:01:31,800
to see him and he was like,
I don't do no,

2728
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:36,860
no research.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking 

2729
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:36,860
about it.
They're just making it up.

2730
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:40,940
He was in the back of the kitchen,
is the comedy store talking and he got 

2731
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:44,501
off stage and he goes,
I said that I would slap your walnut bag

2732
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:47,570
with my.
I forget what it was.

2733
02:01:48,690 --> 02:01:53,690
So stupid,
but they keep paying me so I'll keep 

2734
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:53,690
doing it.

2735
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,300
Yeah,
he's a that,

2736
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:59,280
that style of comedy.
It's just like,

2737
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:03,110
to me it's no different than like,
like how many people like ACDC.

2738
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:04,790
Okay.
I love ACDC.

2739
02:02:04,791 --> 02:02:07,460
They've got some great songs,
but some people don't like it.

2740
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:08,780
Yeah,
but not only that,

2741
02:02:08,781 --> 02:02:11,750
but think about what they're saying.
I'm on the highway to hell.

2742
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:15,590
Are you really,
really silly bitch.

2743
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:20,360
It's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous shit,

2744
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:25,540
but you kind of go along with them 
because it's ACDC and they're saying 

2745
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:26,870
it's rock and it's bad ass song.
When when dice is like,

2746
02:02:26,871 --> 02:02:29,390
here's the.
You suck in my area.

2747
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:33,010
If anybody else did that,
you would build lamer.

2748
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:33,740
Yeah.
He'd be like,

2749
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:34,940
Oh my God,
you're so lame.

2750
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:35,780
And like,
what?

2751
02:02:35,781 --> 02:02:36,650
How old are you are?
Come on.

2752
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:40,520
If some guy went up on one of the shows 
that we have with the ice house,

2753
02:02:40,521 --> 02:02:45,521
some guy that you know,
Brian's cousin knows this guy was going 

2754
02:02:45,521 --> 02:02:45,740
to be 10 minutes or he's really funny.

2755
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:47,150
He goes,
goes on stage.

2756
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:49,190
He's like,
here's to you suck in my.

2757
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:52,580
If you know that didn't exist.
If dyson never done that,

2758
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:55,100
we'd be like,
who is this lame fuck?

2759
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:58,550
Here's to use sucking my dick.
Get that guy out of here.

2760
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:01,610
Yeah,
but when dies does it.

2761
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:04,790
It's somehow hilarious.
Hilarious.

2762
02:03:04,791 --> 02:03:09,791
I had that with a lot of my friends,
whether they do something that I find 

2763
02:03:09,791 --> 02:03:11,801
funny,
other people find just so rude or it's 

2764
02:03:11,801 --> 02:03:12,670
funny when you see a guy like Mike 
holtzman character,

2765
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:17,210
you immediately start laughing at when 
you see and then they'll go on stage and

2766
02:03:17,211 --> 02:03:22,211
you'll see people not get it or not.
Not Understand that it's an act and get 

2767
02:03:22,211 --> 02:03:26,381
like super offended.
Like we were in the front of the comedy 

2768
02:03:26,381 --> 02:03:26,600
store and this lady came out and she 
just goes,

2769
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:27,950
I just want you to know that you were 
really,

2770
02:03:27,951 --> 02:03:29,750
really funny and we really enjoyed 
ourselves,

2771
02:03:29,751 --> 02:03:32,960
but someone needs to take the microphone
away from that man.

2772
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:39,240
Okay.
Because he's not well and I don't think 

2773
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:41,411
indulging him.
You know what he's saying is funny and 

2774
02:03:41,411 --> 02:03:41,411
you want to be like,
well,

2775
02:03:41,411 --> 02:03:44,060
I don't even have to look at it.
Is Shut your fucking mouth.

2776
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,560
Shut your mouth.
Stupid face.

2777
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:50,590
What are the crowd?
Half clear out now it's harder and he 

2778
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:50,840
attacked jail for being stupid.
Wasn't even that.

2779
02:03:50,841 --> 02:03:52,970
He was doing something about Mexicans,
long blowers.

2780
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,400
I put a booger in somebody's drink this 
week.

2781
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:01,360
She left.
I tried to cut her off and like this 

2782
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:01,430
girl is already more.
James says right off the bat,

2783
02:04:01,431 --> 02:04:04,190
she's already too drunk and then she 
starts to orient the audience.

2784
02:04:04,191 --> 02:04:06,360
See you put put a bug.
Yeah,

2785
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:08,530
absolutely.
She went to the bathroom.

2786
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:10,490
That place closed down to the health 
violations.

2787
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:14,480
People eat your boogers.
Her friends saw you were a grown man.

2788
02:04:14,481 --> 02:04:15,380
You in your thirties.
You haven't.

2789
02:04:15,410 --> 02:04:16,910
People eat your boogers.
Drink,

2790
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:19,540
drink.
My blogger friends saw it was.

2791
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,080
She's speaking to a point.
I was like,

2792
02:04:21,081 --> 02:04:22,790
I'm giving you the chance to do it 
before me.

2793
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:25,580
Do you think she just swallowed it or do
you think she felt it and was aware?

2794
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:26,750
No,
I think just swallowed it.

2795
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:30,350
Probably didn't know.
Probably don't know if you really fucked

2796
02:04:30,351 --> 02:04:34,400
up because people can understand once 
you're drunk.

2797
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:38,380
You don't need to keep drinking.
You be in a good place already.

2798
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:39,680
You do if you have demons,
Ari?

2799
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:40,530
Yeah,
I guess so.

2800
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,270
That's the thing.
So maintain.

2801
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:45,450
You're assuming that people drink to 
have a good time.

2802
02:04:45,870 --> 02:04:47,340
A lot of people don't drink to have a 
good time.

2803
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:50,130
They drink to get fucked up because they
want to escape reality.

2804
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:51,580
Yeah,
but that's also a good time for it.

2805
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:53,130
I mean,
I guess it's escape reality,

2806
02:04:53,131 --> 02:04:56,280
but it's also like whatever I drank to 
get drunk wasn't escaping anything.

2807
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,770
He'd be.
He'd been to logical since.

2808
02:04:58,771 --> 02:05:02,430
When have you liked the average person?
When you see it running,

2809
02:05:03,170 --> 02:05:05,400
like in college and stuff,
you're just like,

2810
02:05:05,401 --> 02:05:08,760
you're allowed to drink so you do it 
because it's new.

2811
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,940
Not every college kid is running away 
from their demons.

2812
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,920
Most of them aren't.
They're just getting fucked up.

2813
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:14,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

2814
02:05:14,701 --> 02:05:16,470
Most of them,
they're learning how to get fucked up,

2815
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:19,200
but a lot of people are running from the
demons.

2816
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,160
Yeah,
I guess so.

2817
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:22,890
They just try to get blasted.
That's amazing.

2818
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:26,460
Really drinking alone at a bar feels 
more like that to me.

2819
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:28,110
Does he drink alone at a bar?
I don't know.

2820
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:29,350
I'm picturing that,
you know,

2821
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:34,370
like grizzled,
pure Koski type character as opposed to 

2822
02:05:34,370 --> 02:05:34,370
just like,

2823
02:05:34,370 --> 02:05:37,100
that's perfect pressure pressure.
So maybe it will

2824
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:42,370
and get drunk during the day.
You have a problem unless you're in a 

2825
02:05:42,370 --> 02:05:45,281
good place like Cancun on the beach.
If you wake up and have lunch and I'm 

2826
02:05:47,601 --> 02:05:50,240
going to have a beer at lunch,
why are you drinking?

2827
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:51,740
Right.
There's no reason.

2828
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:52,690
Yeah,
well no.

2829
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:55,490
Maybe a beer with a sandwich or 
something like that,

2830
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:58,880
but what if you want to get like a shot?
That's when you start.

2831
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:04,180
Yeah.
My Dad said he came back from work one 

2832
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:06,221
day and he had some some booze at launch
on a lunch meeting and his boss kind of 

2833
02:06:06,221 --> 02:06:09,440
smelled it on his breath and he said he 
saw the look and then he was like,

2834
02:06:09,441 --> 02:06:11,000
that's it.
No more drinking the day time.

2835
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:16,240
Yeah.
People make too many assumptions about 

2836
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:16,240
you.
Yeah.

2837
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:19,151
You don't want that.
You don't want them to put you in that 

2838
02:06:19,151 --> 02:06:19,151
sort of category.
Yeah.

2839
02:06:19,151 --> 02:06:22,770
It's a funny thing when you really think
about how responsible people actually 

2840
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:24,590
are with alcohol.
If you think about how available it is,

2841
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:28,160
if you're over 21,
did they ever stop you from drinking?

2842
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:29,750
No.
You could always drink.

2843
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:30,980
Oh,
unless you've done some shit,

2844
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:33,410
but if you do some shit like Lindsay 
Lohan,

2845
02:06:33,411 --> 02:06:35,900
how to wear like an ankle bracelet that 
tells you when you're drunk.

2846
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:40,070
How long can they keep that on you?
They can't make that permanent.

2847
02:06:40,071 --> 02:06:42,320
Right?
Can they make a rule?

2848
02:06:42,321 --> 02:06:42,830
Were like,
look,

2849
02:06:42,831 --> 02:06:44,360
we'll let you roam around the street 
fuck head,

2850
02:06:44,361 --> 02:06:49,361
but you got to wear an ankle bracelet 
that tells us if you're drinking soon 

2851
02:06:49,361 --> 02:06:49,361
enough though,
to the CSA,

2852
02:06:49,361 --> 02:06:50,360
you want to fly,
wear an ankle stuff for the next month.

2853
02:06:50,990 --> 02:06:54,710
You'll do that soon.
That's not a bad idea for people who are

2854
02:06:54,711 --> 02:06:56,300
fucking crazy.
You know,

2855
02:06:56,301 --> 02:07:01,301
if you want to control someone who just 
can't handle their alcohol and you 

2856
02:07:01,301 --> 02:07:01,700
realize you get to a certain point in 
time like,

2857
02:07:01,701 --> 02:07:06,701
listen dude,
you've been arrested for drunk driving 

2858
02:07:06,701 --> 02:07:06,701
twice.

2859
02:07:06,701 --> 02:07:07,490
You've been in five different assaults.
You've been so we're going to do stupid.

2860
02:07:07,550 --> 02:07:09,710
We're going to keep you from drinking.
You haven't stopped drinking,

2861
02:07:09,711 --> 02:07:12,080
so this is the way you can be a free 
man.

2862
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:17,140
You wander around,
you have a great time for tenants' 

2863
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:19,430
rights rule.
We find that you drink and you're 

2864
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:19,430
obviously not in control of your 
faculties.

2865
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:20,450
When you're drinking it forever,
you stupid.

2866
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:22,830
Yeah.
Put a price on them for like,

2867
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:28,270
yeah,
but then who's to decide whether or not 

2868
02:07:28,270 --> 02:07:29,921
you should wear that bracelet and 
freedom ain't free and that's when 

2869
02:07:29,921 --> 02:07:29,921
fucking Alex Jones

2870
02:07:29,921 --> 02:07:33,690
14th is trying to put a bracelet on you 
to tell you when you can have some Jack 

2871
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:35,510
Daniels.

2872
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,900
How do you feel about this gun control 
thing?

2873
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:43,870
Um,
I feel like it's a very complex issue 

2874
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:46,620
and it's first of all,
the idea that anybody should be able to 

2875
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:48,130
have fucking military grade weapons I 
think is ridiculous.

2876
02:07:48,690 --> 02:07:50,600
But it comes from it.
Go ahead.

2877
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:55,210
And also,
I think the real issue is not the.

2878
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:57,760
I mean this is a fucking cliche,
but it's not the gun.

2879
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:03,060
The real issue is what would happen to a
person to make them grow up to be 

2880
02:08:03,731 --> 02:08:05,600
someone who could be a school shooter 
ready?

2881
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:06,940
Oh yeah.
That's a mental health issue.

2882
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:09,760
She explored 100 percent.
And by the way,

2883
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:11,080
can I just say this,
Obama,

2884
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:13,780
for the obamacare parts of Obamacare,
they're already put into place,

2885
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:16,420
which is you have to cover mental health
if you're going to cover for everybody,

2886
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:21,860
for all your means that I don't get 
mental health coverage because it's not 

2887
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:22,930
cost effective because they can't afford
doing that.

2888
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:24,520
So they cannot.
They can't let it.

2889
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:29,860
They can't give it to anybody.
I find it amazing how so many people are

2890
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:34,920
so adamant against people or taxpayers 
paying for healthcare,

2891
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:40,320
but don't express nearly the same amount
of concern about your money being used 

2892
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:44,590
for war.
It's really kind of shocking because the

2893
02:08:44,591 --> 02:08:47,110
war money,
it's like where is it even going?

2894
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:52,111
It's going into another part of the 
world where you're most likely never 

2895
02:08:52,111 --> 02:08:54,100
going to visit unless you're in the 
military and it's all going to tanks and

2896
02:08:54,101 --> 02:08:58,780
it's craziness you've seen on TV and 
people are just shelling out their money

2897
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:01,420
in taxes and no one cares.
But the moment someone says,

2898
02:09:01,421 --> 02:09:01,840
Hey,
you know,

2899
02:09:01,841 --> 02:09:04,360
maybe we should make it so that people 
can get some help.

2900
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:06,850
Hey,
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.

2901
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:08,620
Can fucking week pussy,
you know,

2902
02:09:08,621 --> 02:09:09,670
there's something about,
you know,

2903
02:09:09,671 --> 02:09:11,380
we don't need health care,
you know,

2904
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:14,410
what we need is to get back to what made
America great.

2905
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:16,840
And as corporations having all the 
control,

2906
02:09:17,430 --> 02:09:19,270
you know,
they think that separations are going to

2907
02:09:19,271 --> 02:09:24,271
become corrupt.
They're run by people and people are 

2908
02:09:24,271 --> 02:09:24,271
corruptible.
They will always fuck up.

2909
02:09:24,271 --> 02:09:26,530
You give somebody power,
there's a chance they will fuck up.

2910
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:31,680
It's not even just a fucking up.
There's a weird diffusion of 

2911
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:34,501
responsibility thing that happens when 
you are many steps removed from the 

2912
02:09:34,501 --> 02:09:37,720
actual deed and you're involved with 
many other people.

2913
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:42,460
They say it's easier to rape.
A woman in a crowd was woman in front of

2914
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:42,560
one.

2915
02:09:42,650 --> 02:09:44,030
I can see that.
It becomes like,

2916
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:45,470
well,
I'm not responsible for this.

2917
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:47,300
They would tell you this,
this study,

2918
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:48,740
fuck,
it wasn't Pfizer,

2919
02:09:48,741 --> 02:09:51,860
but it was some drug company about polio
vaccines.

2920
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:55,670
They were giving me these polio vaccines
to these African kids.

2921
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:58,370
And um,
but they were lying to them.

2922
02:09:58,371 --> 02:10:00,980
It wasn't a polio vaccine was just 
another drug that we're testing.

2923
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:03,080
And the polio vaccine in 90 percent of 
them.

2924
02:10:03,081 --> 02:10:04,310
And 10 percent on the game of the,
um,

2925
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:05,020
the,
uh,

2926
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:06,550
whatever it's called,
the sugar pill,

2927
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:12,520
because that's a control group.
So the 90 percent of them took the new 

2928
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:15,050
drug that we're testing all died.
Well under 10 percent of them got polio.

2929
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:20,440
Jesus,
because they weren't even getting the 

2930
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:21,941
vaccines.
They were thought they were being 

2931
02:10:21,941 --> 02:10:21,941
tested.
Ouch.

2932
02:10:21,941 --> 02:10:26,440
Yeah.
And that's just what some corporation 

2933
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:26,440
does that make more money.
That's just a normal sort of situation.

2934
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,350
It's over there.
Don't worry about it.

2935
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:29,630
Exxon has that with a rape,
the land,

2936
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:33,830
wherever they go and just buy out their 
government and say new rules.

2937
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,160
Well,
I was trying to get John Perkins on and 

2938
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:39,160
I'll try again.
Um,

2939
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:41,690
now that we have matt stags on the case,
are you hearing us Matt?

2940
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:44,510
Go get the economic hitman guy because 
he's a,

2941
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:47,600
he's a fascinating guy.
He used to do that for the government.

2942
02:10:47,601 --> 02:10:49,970
He will go and the,
Oh there's Alex Jones.

2943
02:10:50,410 --> 02:10:55,410
You will not take our guns.
Jon Stewart reacting to Alan.

2944
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:03,160
So taking away all the guns.
But now I get it.

2945
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:07,060
Now I see what's happening.
So this is what it is.

2946
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:12,990
They're paranoid.
Fear of a possible dystopic future 

2947
02:11:12,990 --> 02:11:17,440
prevents us from addressing our actual 
dystopic present.

2948
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,020
We can't even begin to

2949
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:22,360
too many uses of the words that stupid.
Stop it.

2950
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:24,350
I understand.
You live in New York and you're Jewish.

2951
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:26,600
They got sick.
He is huge.

2952
02:11:26,601 --> 02:11:27,620
Cold.
During this thing,

2953
02:11:27,650 --> 02:11:31,850
like did he come in any way?
Just because it was such a crazy story.

2954
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:35,510
Talking about Alex Jones is off the 
rails.

2955
02:11:35,511 --> 02:11:36,710
Man.
I get it though.

2956
02:11:36,711 --> 02:11:39,590
With the military grade weapons.
The point was never to be able to hunt.

2957
02:11:39,591 --> 02:11:44,591
We're at the point was able to drive off
the government and you're not going to 

2958
02:11:44,591 --> 02:11:44,591
do it with a fucking six pistol.
Will.

2959
02:11:44,591 --> 02:11:49,010
The idea is to protect yourself against 
threats to this nation,

2960
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:52,640
both domestic and abroad.
That's the idea is that,

2961
02:11:52,641 --> 02:11:57,641
you know,
they had to worry about being overtaken 

2962
02:11:57,641 --> 02:12:00,371
from within.
That's why you have the right to bear 

2963
02:12:00,371 --> 02:12:00,371
arms and you know,
everybody says,

2964
02:12:00,371 --> 02:12:04,241
well,
those book when people had muskets and 

2965
02:12:04,241 --> 02:12:04,241
this and that,
the government's corrupt now that it was

2966
02:12:04,241 --> 02:12:04,490
then.

2967
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:09,550
But by the way,
the government had muskets as well back 

2968
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:12,371
then and now the government doesn't have
any and they didn't have the ability to 

2969
02:12:12,371 --> 02:12:12,371
arrest you for no reason.
You know,

2970
02:12:12,371 --> 02:12:17,231
I'm not saying that you should go and 
fucking overtake the government with 

2971
02:12:17,231 --> 02:12:17,231
forest because I definitely don't 
believe that.

2972
02:12:17,231 --> 02:12:19,070
But what do you think is the way to get 
rid of people?

2973
02:12:19,190 --> 02:12:22,430
I think that the issue is not people 
being armed.

2974
02:12:22,490 --> 02:12:24,020
The issue is crazy.
People.

2975
02:12:24,050 --> 02:12:27,980
The issue is disenfranchised people.
The issue is people that have legitimate

2976
02:12:27,981 --> 02:12:30,830
mental problems.
The issue is diagnosing them.

2977
02:12:30,831 --> 02:12:35,831
The issue is trying to figure out how 
the fuck a person becomes that 

2978
02:12:35,831 --> 02:12:38,150
sociopathic fucking psychopathic killer.
How does that.

2979
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:40,250
That's.
That's our real problem.

2980
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:45,580
Because when you look at the actual 
numbers of human beings and you look at 

2981
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:48,791
the actual numbers of human beings with 
guns and then you look at the actual 

2982
02:12:48,791 --> 02:12:48,791
numbers of crimes,
like people like to say,

2983
02:12:48,791 --> 02:12:50,090
oh,
England has no guns,

2984
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:51,860
so they have no gun crimes.

2985
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:56,570
That is absolutely true.
They have like 30 or something shootings

2986
02:12:56,571 --> 02:12:58,880
every year.
It's like nothing compared to the United

2987
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:00,950
States.
But if you look at the overall number of

2988
02:13:00,951 --> 02:13:05,570
armed people in Britain to the overall 
number of armed people in America,

2989
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:10,840
it's really kind of shocking that we 
have as few murders by guns that we do 

2990
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:14,681
and rose to the murders by guns,
like a good 70 percent of the assault 

2991
02:13:14,751 --> 02:13:19,751
rifle type killings or gang related or 
really high percentage of them have to 

2992
02:13:19,911 --> 02:13:22,880
do with gang violence.
We're going to tell you that's it.

2993
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:26,240
That's why up mean largely an economic 
issue,

2994
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:29,570
largely a poverty issue.
And then a drug dealing issue.

2995
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:33,450
A couple of different aspects of our 
society that are obviously sick,

2996
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,370
you know,
the,

2997
02:13:34,371 --> 02:13:38,400
the illegal access to drugs,
meaning that anybody sells drugs,

2998
02:13:38,401 --> 02:13:40,500
that's criminal.
That's one,

2999
02:13:40,530 --> 02:13:43,140
that's one aspect that leads to 
organized crime,

3000
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:43,740
you know.

3001
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:46,200
And then the other aspect of course is 
poverty.

3002
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:49,170
People growing up,
disenfranchise needing someone somewhere

3003
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:54,171
to belong to.
They become a part of gangs and gangs 

3004
02:13:54,171 --> 02:13:54,171
are fucking huge and they're killing 
each other.

3005
02:13:54,171 --> 02:13:54,290
I mean it's,
it's,

3006
02:13:54,291 --> 02:13:58,920
it's a super common thing that they use 
those types of weapons in,

3007
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:01,260
in gang.
I wonder like drive bys and stuff.

3008
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:02,430
Yeah.
But I look,

3009
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,410
I don't think everybody should have 
access to those guns.

3010
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:06,540
That's where I parked from the average 
person.

3011
02:14:06,541 --> 02:14:09,270
I think if you have a reason to have 
those guns,

3012
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:11,780
that's one thing.
But if you're.

3013
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:16,850
I mean,
if you were looking for something to 

3014
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:16,850
protect yourself,
um,

3015
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:17,910
do you really need machine guns?
I mean,

3016
02:14:17,911 --> 02:14:20,760
can you get by with a shotgun?
Can you get by with a rifle?

3017
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:25,940
I mean,
the idea is that if somebody wanted to 

3018
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:30,021
go and kill a bunch of people,
it would be far harder if you had 

3019
02:14:30,021 --> 02:14:31,380
something like a single loading rifle or
shotgun.

3020
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:34,050
But then the argument of course from the
NRA people would be,

3021
02:14:34,051 --> 02:14:37,760
well,
if you really want to apply the language

3022
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:41,070
and the declaration of independence,
the Second Amendment being that you have

3023
02:14:41,071 --> 02:14:46,071
the right to bear arms,
the idea means that you have the right 

3024
02:14:46,071 --> 02:14:49,341
to protect yourself against whoever it 
may be who easily could be overpowering 

3025
02:14:49,861 --> 02:14:51,450
you.
They can have more fire power than you.

3026
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:55,140
So if you have what they have and you 
have a 50 caliber machine gun,

3027
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:56,850
you have what they have,
they,

3028
02:14:56,870 --> 02:15:01,870
you're,
you're on an equal playing field and 

3029
02:15:01,870 --> 02:15:03,651
they can't come and take your land.
The problem is they won't let you like 

3030
02:15:03,651 --> 02:15:06,590
doesn't happen at Waco.
When they started taking a bunch of 

3031
02:15:06,590 --> 02:15:06,590
weapons,
well they also fucking their kids.

3032
02:15:06,590 --> 02:15:10,700
But who knows if that's true because 
that's the first thing I was there and 

3033
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:13,400
blew them all up.
If you want to go and get somebody to 

3034
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:14,000
come and become a threat to the powerful
person in government,

3035
02:15:14,130 --> 02:15:15,150
they're just going to wipe you out.

3036
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,780
And that's why people in Libya and need 
actual machine guns to make change.

3037
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:24,010
They can't do it through voting and 
we're starting to not be able to do it 

3038
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:24,010
through voting either.
You're right.

3039
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:25,320
And I honestly,
the more I look at it,

3040
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:28,050
the situation we have here with our 
government not representing us,

3041
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:31,570
I only really see one way around it.
Oh,

3042
02:15:31,670 --> 02:15:36,670
he's talking crazy talk.
This is the end of this podcast and if 

3043
02:15:36,670 --> 02:15:36,670
you want to continue,
this conversation will be on there.

3044
02:15:36,670 --> 02:15:40,560
Skeptic tank available on itunes and the
part of me will be paid by Jason Team.

3045
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:42,480
Um,
yeah.

3046
02:15:42,481 --> 02:15:43,250
Well,
I mean,

3047
02:15:43,251 --> 02:15:45,340
I don't know how the government has 
bigger businesses.

3048
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:50,360
They are,
would exceed any control if they don't 

3049
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:52,491
have to and they no longer have to.
Well the problem is it's eating itself.

3050
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:58,700
See the access to information that the 
government has now and the ability to 

3051
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:02,241
wire tap phones,
the ability to spy on people's lives is 

3052
02:16:02,241 --> 02:16:05,031
now eating itself because the fucking 
FBI investigated CIA,

3053
02:16:05,470 --> 02:16:09,540
another director of the CIA is no longer
there because they went digging into his

3054
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:10,110
privacy.

3055
02:16:10,590 --> 02:16:12,000
That's what happened.
I mean they're,

3056
02:16:12,001 --> 02:16:15,540
they're spying on each other.
It's fucking spy versus spy.

3057
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:19,470
Our tax dollars being spent to expose a 
guy getting some pussy.

3058
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:25,040
Do you think if you,
if you could go back and remove every 

3059
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:25,800
great leader,
every man of power.

3060
02:16:25,801 --> 02:16:28,050
If you're military combat,
especially military.

3061
02:16:28,230 --> 02:16:31,840
I mean you're talking about a in David 
betray us that had been in Baltimore for

3062
02:16:31,841 --> 02:16:36,841
a long time.
He had seen a lot of death and you're 

3063
02:16:36,841 --> 02:16:38,820
going to deny him some extra pussy.
Do you think that his sensual?

3064
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:41,250
Yeah.
And a hot chick who's young,

3065
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:42,820
that's what he got.
The whole thing was in trouble for.

3066
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:44,500
Yeah,
that's what he got in trouble for.

3067
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:48,760
But it also had to do somehow or another
relating it to Bengazi,

3068
02:16:48,761 --> 02:16:52,900
the attack on Libya where they were 
woefully unprotected.

3069
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:56,770
Their information failed them.
And they attack those people in the.

3070
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:58,160
Killed The American,
uh,

3071
02:16:58,570 --> 02:16:59,820
American ambassador.
Yeah.

3072
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:05,100
So there's that as well that they 
believe is somehow or another connected 

3073
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:08,281
to it.
And they made up that story that it was 

3074
02:17:08,281 --> 02:17:08,281
all about some movie.
Yes.

3075
02:17:08,281 --> 02:17:08,281
Yes.
That was through.

3076
02:17:08,281 --> 02:17:10,120
It was really amazing.
She made up a story,

3077
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:11,620
eat up a story.
These fucks.

3078
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:16,800
They made up a story about this all 
being inspired by a crazy bad movie,

3079
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:24,620
a web movie that most likely was,
was sponsored and made by the spooks 

3080
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:30,400
that they made it themselves.
They really hired some actors and they 

3081
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,170
put together a Shitty fucking propaganda
movie and they made it themselves.

3082
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:34,190
Not only that,
the people that were in the movie,

3083
02:17:34,191 --> 02:17:37,120
he said that they said certain things,
but then when they watched the movie,

3084
02:17:37,121 --> 02:17:38,830
other words were dubbed into their 
mouths.

3085
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:39,880
Oh really?
Yeah,

3086
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:45,080
so the idea was that this movie was just
created as a scapegoat and then everyone

3087
02:17:45,081 --> 02:17:50,081
would react to that movie,
so while we can't bow down to these 

3088
02:17:50,081 --> 02:17:53,040
Muslims or like you've got to be up at 
least aware of their feelings and that 

3089
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:54,160
just throwing us off the real trail.

3090
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:56,590
Have you ever seen that movie?
Saw pieces of it?

3091
02:17:56,610 --> 02:17:58,390
It's fucking unbelievably bad.
Oh yeah.

3092
02:17:58,391 --> 02:17:59,060
It's like,
like,

3093
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,250
like,
like Peter Term.

3094
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:01,610
Yeah,
exactly.

3095
02:18:01,690 --> 02:18:04,490
Someone who's just a complete madness 
just ended up here,

3096
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,640
doesn't know what he's doing.
It's like America world police.

3097
02:18:06,641 --> 02:18:08,620
If it was people just got a video 
camera,

3098
02:18:08,970 --> 02:18:09,730
isn't it Brian?
If you,

3099
02:18:09,731 --> 02:18:12,300
if you've seen it pull up.
Yeah,

3100
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:14,830
it's like America worldly when it's like
I'm an actor,

3101
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:17,110
I have to go and save the world.
Like ridiculous,

3102
02:18:17,111 --> 02:18:19,420
crazy cheesy dialogue,
but not funny,

3103
02:18:19,421 --> 02:18:20,380
you know,
not on purpose.

3104
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:23,260
What they're trying to do is really make
a really,

3105
02:18:23,261 --> 02:18:28,261
really dumb propaganda movie to justify 
the reason why these terrorists would 

3106
02:18:28,261 --> 02:18:29,500
sent to warships over there.
Almost instantly.

3107
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:29,860
I'm like,
wait,

3108
02:18:29,861 --> 02:18:30,970
what's happening?
Tell you what,

3109
02:18:30,971 --> 02:18:35,320
man is a guy who was a mob deep,
deep in the world of intelligence.

3110
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:37,930
Since I've been addicted to homeland,
I understand.

3111
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:42,010
Be a little bit alien to you don't know 
how the system works.

3112
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:45,370
I've become a fan of the CIA from doing 
homeland option that showed.

3113
02:18:45,371 --> 02:18:45,990
Yeah,
fuck yeah.

3114
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:51,180
That show literally changes my opinion 
on what it must be like for the CIA to 

3115
02:18:52,511 --> 02:18:57,511
try to thwart terrorism and it makes me 
understand why they would want to take 

3116
02:18:57,511 --> 02:19:02,251
rights away.
I still don't agree with their ability 

3117
02:19:02,251 --> 02:19:03,961
to do so,
but I understand the kind of shit that 

3118
02:19:03,961 --> 02:19:04,730
they probably only do you have to deal 
with.

3119
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:06,060
The only problem with taking their 
rights away.

3120
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:07,960
It's not.
If it's from a reason it's been good.

3121
02:19:07,961 --> 02:19:09,730
It's that let's say your,
your,

3122
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:14,820
your reasons are pure.
Like I just want to go after terrorists 

3123
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:15,100
when there's fewer full terrorists.
Well what happens?

3124
02:19:15,101 --> 02:19:18,280
The next guy who was in office who might
not share your sentiment about fair,

3125
02:19:18,310 --> 02:19:19,750
that's an.
That's an old statement.

3126
02:19:19,751 --> 02:19:24,751
The man.
You're saying yes to today's not the 

3127
02:19:24,751 --> 02:19:26,611
same man.
You're going to have to say yes to 20 

3128
02:19:26,611 --> 02:19:28,231
years from now.
If you give someone access to your 

3129
02:19:28,231 --> 02:19:28,231
privacy today and he's a good guy,

3130
02:19:28,231 --> 02:19:33,190
that doesn't mean that you know,
we can have a new Nixon or he's not 

3131
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:33,190
going to turn into a bad guy.
Yeah.

3132
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:34,970
So y'all gonna start abusing my power.
That's an always start from scratch.

3133
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Yeah.
And didn't that happen with the 

3134
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:40,000
president of Egypt?
This guy gets in,

3135
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:40,040
gets elected.
The Muslim Brotherhood is like,

3136
02:19:40,041 --> 02:19:41,560
you know,
I decided I made a dictator,

3137
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:44,840
no immune to prosecution.
And they were like,

3138
02:19:44,841 --> 02:19:45,910
hey.
And he goes,

3139
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,920
no,
I have to in order to be able to run a 

3140
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:50,920
good government.
And people are like,

3141
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:50,920
no,
no,

3142
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:50,920
no,
no,

3143
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:52,160
because what we just got away from doing
that shit.

3144
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:57,220
Hilarious.
The guy tried gangster right off the 

3145
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:57,220
bat.
I,

3146
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:57,220
you need get to be here.
He gave on it,

3147
02:19:57,270 --> 02:19:59,690
gave him oh great.
Foreign power.

3148
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:01,000
Well he's,
you know,

3149
02:20:01,001 --> 02:20:04,160
he's fucked now know they're going to be
looking sideways at him forever.

3150
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:06,170
I mean he was the savior who was the 
new.

3151
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,570
You can't just do that.
Of course they should kill them.

3152
02:20:10,350 --> 02:20:13,310
Thinking about Carolyn anymore,
no killing anymore.

3153
02:20:13,330 --> 02:20:18,330
Extended to stop.
They just keep going for a little while 

3154
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:18,330
longer.
That's the problem.

3155
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:18,440
They get rid of the one guy and then 
they're like,

3156
02:20:18,441 --> 02:20:20,090
let's get more people.
That's what they didn't like.

3157
02:20:20,091 --> 02:20:21,280
The French.
Right.

3158
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:26,410
You know all those things too,
where you got to think all those dudes 

3159
02:20:26,410 --> 02:20:29,180
in Libya kill every one of those dudes.
That fucking stuck sticks up his ass.

3160
02:20:29,181 --> 02:20:29,910
All that shit.
Yeah.

3161
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:33,290
Those guys are just running around out 
there that want to kill more people.

3162
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:35,250
Maybe somebody killed them.
Excited.

3163
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:37,640
Get all fired up.
Killed Kadafi.

3164
02:20:37,970 --> 02:20:42,970
I wonder if they do like public speaking
engagements like they do the clubs out 

3165
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:46,031
there is a dime.
I took the stick was close to table.

3166
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:50,980
The time was now I shut the stick up his
ass and everybody's.

3167
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:53,470
Yeah,
they throw their shoes.

3168
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:56,500
Tell us.
Did he say

3169
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:59,590
scheme?
He was used to cook cellular was nothing

3170
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:05,980
that he wanted more.
He wish he had it everyday of his life 

3171
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:07,530
with a bowl of milk in the morning and 
sticking his eyes.

3172
02:21:10,350 --> 02:21:13,150
He didn't even react.
The shoved a stick up his house.

3173
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:17,650
He was in total shock,
just react that much or period at all.

3174
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:20,970
Apparently he was in full shock.
Wow.

3175
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:26,390
They dragged that guy out.
He couldn't believe he was out there 

3176
02:21:26,390 --> 02:21:27,480
with the regular people.
The look on his face Qaddafi's.

3177
02:21:27,570 --> 02:21:32,570
That is one of the best.
Like it as far as like a peek into what 

3178
02:21:34,171 --> 02:21:39,171
happens when a dictator gets overcome by
the rebels and you actually get to watch

3179
02:21:40,051 --> 02:21:42,150
it.
I've never seen that before where we saw

3180
02:21:42,151 --> 02:21:42,780
it.
We were there.

3181
02:21:42,830 --> 02:21:43,860
Yeah,
we were there.

3182
02:21:43,890 --> 02:21:48,890
We knew that doesn't exist anywhere in 
history and it was on a fucking cell 

3183
02:21:48,890 --> 02:21:48,930
phone camera.

3184
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:49,810
No.
Hello.

3185
02:21:51,790 --> 02:21:54,910
He's fucking freaking out and covered in
blood and looking for someone to come in

3186
02:21:54,911 --> 02:21:56,230
and rescue them and has someone ever 
comes.

3187
02:21:56,231 --> 02:21:58,810
They're sticking sticks up his ass.
They just fucking start shooting them.

3188
02:21:58,990 --> 02:21:59,920
Wow.
Yeah.

3189
02:21:59,921 --> 02:22:00,430
They,
they,

3190
02:22:00,431 --> 02:22:03,040
they dragged that guy around on the roof
of a car.

3191
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:08,310
It was amazing.
I mean it was like literally everything 

3192
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:09,550
that you would see like in a movie about
a dictator getting overthrown,

3193
02:22:09,551 --> 02:22:14,551
but you never saw that before.
And to see the look of terror on his 

3194
02:22:14,551 --> 02:22:18,841
face and to know that man,
that is a story that has been playing 

3195
02:22:18,911 --> 02:22:22,540
itself out exactly the same way over and
over.

3196
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:25,180
Throughout time.
You changed dictators.

3197
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:25,900
That's the way

3198
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:28,270
that's the normal route.
What is that?

3199
02:22:28,340 --> 02:22:33,340
That phrase that the tree of liberty 
must be occasionally watered with the 

3200
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:39,990
death of enemies and patriots under his 
end patriots.

3201
02:22:41,100 --> 02:22:42,870
Pinterest fighting.
I think that's the quote,

3202
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:48,320
but yeah,
the idea that you just need in order to 

3203
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:48,320
stay,
you want,

3204
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:51,490
you want liberty every now and then you 
gotta fuck some people up because the 

3205
02:22:51,490 --> 02:22:55,610
normal pattern that people follow for 
whatever reason is once they get into 

3206
02:22:55,610 --> 02:22:56,970
position of being able to tell what 
people what to do,

3207
02:22:57,150 --> 02:22:59,040
they separate them from those other 
people.

3208
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:02,820
Did I seen that the comedy store had it 
where managers worked as a.

3209
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:04,810
When I worked as a security guard,
I,

3210
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:08,010
I worked for a few months as a security 
guard in a concert place.

3211
02:23:08,011 --> 02:23:13,011
Every night we're shutting up drunks and
every night and it became us versus 

3212
02:23:13,011 --> 02:23:13,011
them.
And I wasn't a cop.

3213
02:23:13,011 --> 02:23:17,600
We couldn't arrest anybody,
but I got to see and I would have to 

3214
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:20,901
tell people,
you can't bring your booze and he can't 

3215
02:23:20,901 --> 02:23:20,901
bring bottles,
and he came and they would yell at me,

3216
02:23:20,901 --> 02:23:20,901
fuck you.

3217
02:23:20,901 --> 02:23:23,160
And it became us versus them and we all 
banded together,

3218
02:23:23,161 --> 02:23:25,020
all the security guards in our 
attitudes.

3219
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:27,480
Least cons coming in.
Fucking assholes.

3220
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:32,600
Like right away,
even though you're hired to make sure 

3221
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:32,600
everyone's having a good time.
Well,

3222
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:33,300
you're hired to keep everybody from 
bringing in booze.

3223
02:23:33,301 --> 02:23:38,301
Mostly our main job was we would be 
there at the beginning like James Taylor

3224
02:23:38,311 --> 02:23:43,311
to play and all these people who just 
going bring a nice bottle of wine goes 

3225
02:23:43,311 --> 02:23:43,311
he,
James Taylor.

3226
02:23:43,311 --> 02:23:44,520
You can't bring bottles of wine to a 
place that sells wine.

3227
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:49,840
Okay.
So when you get there and we take your 

3228
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:49,840
wine.
So we'd have to take people's bags.

3229
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:53,151
We opened them up.
Do you have anything in here that we 

3230
02:23:53,151 --> 02:23:53,151
should know about?
No.

3231
02:23:53,151 --> 02:23:53,151
Did you bring any alcohol in a bottle?
No.

3232
02:23:53,151 --> 02:23:54,570
What's this?
He pulled out a bottle of wine plunk.

3233
02:23:54,850 --> 02:23:58,410
It didn't kick them out,
but you'd put the wine in like a bucket.

3234
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:03,620
So at the end of the night we'd have 
giant garbage buckets with booze,

3235
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:05,520
nice.
And everybody's like,

3236
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:06,370
you're good,
fuck.

3237
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:11,390
Then we took their boots.
Like that was the attitude of all the 

3238
02:24:11,390 --> 02:24:13,791
people that work there.
And so if you work there like you 

3239
02:24:13,791 --> 02:24:14,390
develop that sort of attitude too,
like everybody's like,

3240
02:24:15,030 --> 02:24:16,650
yeah,
relationship,

3241
02:24:17,290 --> 02:24:20,730
security guard or a great woods.
But granted I was 18,

3242
02:24:20,731 --> 02:24:23,610
19 and I recognize it as it was 
happening.

3243
02:24:23,611 --> 02:24:25,230
And then I was like,
this is fucking,

3244
02:24:25,730 --> 02:24:28,340
that's the same thing as Tsa.
They're going to do the same shit.

3245
02:24:28,430 --> 02:24:33,430
Exactly the same shit.
And I finally realized this now with 

3246
02:24:33,430 --> 02:24:37,061
somebody,
it's like people they excuse it always 

3247
02:24:37,061 --> 02:24:38,531
made me troubled with Tsa while they're 
fucking infringing on our rights and 

3248
02:24:38,531 --> 02:24:39,290
looking through all my shit and make me 
take my shoes off.

3249
02:24:39,291 --> 02:24:41,120
And all this stuff is,
is,

3250
02:24:41,121 --> 02:24:42,680
um,
is uh,

3251
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:44,300
uh,
they're just doing their jobs.

3252
02:24:44,390 --> 02:24:47,090
It's not their fault individually,
but I tell him to go fuck themselves.

3253
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:48,350
It's still,
they're just doing their jobs.

3254
02:24:48,770 --> 02:24:50,360
Well,
why is that an excuse?

3255
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:55,900
You know what you're doing.
You're taking a job fucking with people 

3256
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:56,450
because it's the job.
You're allowed to do whatever you want.

3257
02:24:56,451 --> 02:25:01,451
We'll see.
I don't think because someone check 

3258
02:25:01,451 --> 02:25:01,451
attached to it.

3259
02:25:01,451 --> 02:25:01,820
I don't think Tsa fucks with people for 
the most part.

3260
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:04,130
I have not had a single problem with 
Tsa.

3261
02:25:04,131 --> 02:25:07,130
I have not seen a single problem with 
Tsa ever

3262
02:25:07,430 --> 02:25:09,510
except for like when I mentioned go 
through this exercise,

3263
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:10,370
things they didn't test

3264
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:12,610
well,
those extra things.

3265
02:25:12,611 --> 02:25:15,950
Which ones?
The ones that spin the penis.

3266
02:25:16,290 --> 02:25:17,780
Yeah,
the ones they didn't test,

3267
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:18,550
but they were just like,
oh,

3268
02:25:18,551 --> 02:25:20,170
we'll take their word for it.
Or The guy who owns it,

3269
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:25,230
what I read according to what I've read 
and the that you get inside a plane is 

3270
02:25:25,230 --> 02:25:27,880
way worse than that and it's not 
something to worry about.

3271
02:25:28,570 --> 02:25:33,570
I would love if they just actually put 
out the tests they did instead of hide 

3272
02:25:33,570 --> 02:25:33,570
it.
It's a good idea.

3273
02:25:33,570 --> 02:25:34,450
Yeah.
And or allow independent testing.

3274
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:39,480
It's a good idea,
but I think that what they're worried 

3275
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:39,480
about,
right or wrong,

3276
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:42,040
I disagree with it because I think there
should be full disclosure always when it

3277
02:25:42,041 --> 02:25:44,770
comes to things in regard health and 
radiation and shit like that,

3278
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:50,190
but they don't want to release the fact 
that you get a lot of radiation on a 

3279
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:50,190
fucking plane.

3280
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:54,540
You get so much radiation on a plane 
that sometimes they have to fly 

3281
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:58,021
different paths because they're solar 
flares and you're flying in weird spots.

3282
02:25:58,361 --> 02:26:03,361
Yeah,
you can fly in areas where there's too 

3283
02:26:03,361 --> 02:26:06,121
much solar activity and it's fucking 
British gamma radiation closer to the 

3284
02:26:06,121 --> 02:26:06,121
sun.
Well,

3285
02:26:06,121 --> 02:26:08,710
you're fucking 30,000
feet and space.

3286
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:10,600
You know,
you're really high up there,

3287
02:26:10,601 --> 02:26:15,601
man.
Little metal tube and you're getting 

3288
02:26:15,601 --> 02:26:16,090
blasted by gamma rays.
You're really close to,

3289
02:26:16,091 --> 02:26:16,720
uh,
you know,

3290
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:19,810
you're close to space,
closer to space by.

3291
02:26:20,650 --> 02:26:22,130
What is it?
What is 30,000

3292
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:23,410
people at three?
How many miles is that?

3293
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:24,960
How many was it?
Five thousand miles.

3294
02:26:24,961 --> 02:26:29,080
Miles.
Five hundred miles is a 5,000

3295
02:26:29,081 --> 02:26:30,280
feet is a mile,
right?

3296
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:32,710
So yeah,
you're high up there man.

3297
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:37,830
So apparently that is not good for you 
and they don't want people to really 

3298
02:26:37,830 --> 02:26:40,570
dwell on that because it's,
there's radiation in all things,

3299
02:26:40,571 --> 02:26:42,550
there's radiation and trees,
what have you.

3300
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:47,550
So what do you think?
They don't want people to dwell on it 

3301
02:26:47,550 --> 02:26:47,550
because if you start telling people,
if some,

3302
02:26:47,550 --> 02:26:49,120
listen man,
next time you're on a plane,

3303
02:26:49,121 --> 02:26:54,121
why don't you do it for a skeptic tank,
bring a geiger counter geiger counter 

3304
02:26:54,121 --> 02:26:55,180
and I go,
you go online on Amazon.com

3305
02:26:55,181 --> 02:26:58,990
and get something that is a radiation 
reader and see if it works that way.

3306
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:00,850
I mean I don't know if that's how it 
works.

3307
02:27:00,851 --> 02:27:02,230
I think that's how you would do it 
though.

3308
02:27:02,530 --> 02:27:04,900
So anyway you would,
you would get that and you know,

3309
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:10,020
get a reading and then compare that 
somehow or another you would have to 

3310
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:11,680
fucking get a reading off of one of 
those x ray machines at the airport.

3311
02:27:11,681 --> 02:27:13,630
But they wouldn't let you do that.
But if you did,

3312
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:18,690
I bet the plane would probably be at 
least as radioactive if not way more.

3313
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:21,310
What I've read is that it's more.

3314
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,790
But again,
how much information is really available

3315
02:27:24,791 --> 02:27:27,970
out there about those folks and make 
your putting ingredients on everything.

3316
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:31,030
You shouldn't have to get fucking x 
rayed everywhere.

3317
02:27:31,031 --> 02:27:36,031
It's just the it people want to blow 
things up all the time and it's always 

3318
02:27:36,031 --> 02:27:39,190
planes.
It's like when is it going to happen?

3319
02:27:39,191 --> 02:27:40,330
We're enough.
Cuts.

3320
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:43,930
Blow up a mall where every time you go 
to the mall you have to put your fucking

3321
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:48,931
change in a bucket and go through and 
then someone's going to be stealing 

3322
02:27:48,931 --> 02:27:48,931
watches and shit.
They're just like,

3323
02:27:48,931 --> 02:27:51,640
they do a tsa every now and then you get
a rogue employee.

3324
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:52,840
I hate it when they.
When they fight,

3325
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:55,750
where they,
when they catch some guy as news company

3326
02:27:55,751 --> 02:28:00,751
will catch some guys stealing who works 
for the airline and the airline is the 

3327
02:28:00,751 --> 02:28:04,191
only reaction is they no longer work 
here that have been been been 

3328
02:28:04,191 --> 02:28:04,191
terminated.
It's like,

3329
02:28:04,191 --> 02:28:07,051
no,
you should fucking put print off for 

3330
02:28:07,051 --> 02:28:07,051
trial.
Yeah,

3331
02:28:07,051 --> 02:28:08,140
stealing while the representing the 
government should have been way worse.

3332
02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:10,270
They don't try and they just fucking say
they're out.

3333
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:11,460
That's it.
They're out.

3334
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:13,150
Just like the prettiest.
That's the worst thing that'll happen to

3335
02:28:13,151 --> 02:28:18,151
him or her out.
I guess they figured that the prisons 

3336
02:28:18,151 --> 02:28:21,221
today are so fucking overcrowded and the
justice system is so understaffed and 

3337
02:28:21,221 --> 02:28:22,190
overworked.
If I knew my only

3338
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:27,220
fucking repercussions were that I don't 
have this job where I get to steal 

3339
02:28:27,220 --> 02:28:27,920
anymore just to like crazy still.
Yeah,

3340
02:28:27,921 --> 02:28:29,830
until you get caught and then now you 
don't get to steal anymore.

3341
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:34,840
Either way.
I don't want to steal some steel wire 

3342
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:36,890
can.
It's really funny when they get super 

3343
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:37,580
ghetto at the TSA station,
like someone will say something.

3344
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:38,640
It was,
oh no,

3345
02:28:38,641 --> 02:28:39,120
no,
no,

3346
02:28:39,121 --> 02:28:40,560
no.
I wasn't involved with that.

3347
02:28:40,590 --> 02:28:41,980
I wasn't involved with that.
Like,

3348
02:28:42,150 --> 02:28:43,840
Oh,
I know you were with that guy

3349
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:50,200
and the like,
don't forget that like this is their 

3350
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:53,320
security officers for the government,
but just he has just sort of dumb people

3351
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:55,160
are just folks who that's the job of 
that.

3352
02:28:55,161 --> 02:28:56,480
You get started.
Raise your hands.

3353
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:58,040
This is what I always say.
I can't raise my hands.

3354
02:28:58,490 --> 02:28:59,820
Why I'm,
I'm,

3355
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:02,450
I'm not under arrest.
Am I doing things that make me seem like

3356
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:04,100
I'm under arrest?
So when you go through the thing,

3357
02:29:04,101 --> 02:29:06,000
you won't raise your hands.
Whoa.

3358
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:07,640
Yeah.
And they say,

3359
02:29:07,641 --> 02:29:08,570
why not?
You don't trust me.

3360
02:29:08,571 --> 02:29:10,700
I'm like,
I don't trust the company you work for.

3361
02:29:10,701 --> 02:29:12,410
And the fact that you work for them.
No,

3362
02:29:12,411 --> 02:29:13,760
I don't trust you.
Who are you?

3363
02:29:13,790 --> 02:29:16,220
Some lady.
So when you go through security,

3364
02:29:16,221 --> 02:29:17,810
do you cause a stink,
do you say?

3365
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:19,530
Usually I try to time it up.
Any Jew?

3366
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:21,050
I'm not here.
I don't say it like that.

3367
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:23,270
But when they had the pat me down,
like we got to patch it down.

3368
02:29:23,271 --> 02:29:24,320
Did you say you prefer that?
I'm like,

3369
02:29:24,321 --> 02:29:25,370
no,
I don't prefer that.

3370
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:27,170
But if you could give me no fucking 
options,

3371
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:30,040
do whatever the fuck you want to talk.
Oh yeah.

3372
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:31,370
Fuck them.
Fuck them.

3373
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:34,730
You could tell me.
You tell Brian to go from punch somebody

3374
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:37,520
and then he does it really mean Brian,
you shouldn't have done that.

3375
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:38,030
But it's like,
no,

3376
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:38,330
no,
no.

3377
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:40,010
He gave me.
Rogan gave me 20 bucks.

3378
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:42,160
So it was just my job.
So I was working okay.

3379
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:45,480
That's a bit extreme,
but they're just going to have rights.

3380
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:48,560
They're making us all feel really bad,
but they're just doing a job.

3381
02:29:48,561 --> 02:29:49,610
They're not.
They're just doing.

3382
02:29:49,611 --> 02:29:51,880
Their job is not an excuse.
Right?

3383
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:52,700
Wouldn't be if there were

3384
02:29:52,750 --> 02:29:55,270
being violent to you,
but I think the analogy is not fair.

3385
02:29:55,300 --> 02:30:00,300
It's like they're not getting you there.
Just making sure you don't have bombs 

3386
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:00,340
and most likely you don't have bombs.
See for you,

3387
02:30:00,341 --> 02:30:00,820
you're like,
well,

3388
02:30:00,821 --> 02:30:01,930
look at me.
I'm fucking.

3389
02:30:01,931 --> 02:30:04,040
I'm a handsome young man.
Um,

3390
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:04,630
obviously

3391
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:10,750
now I'll just search your shit just 
because they're just making sure you 

3392
02:30:10,750 --> 02:30:10,750
don't have bombs.

3393
02:30:10,750 --> 02:30:11,100
But they are.
They're allowed.

3394
02:30:11,101 --> 02:30:12,870
That's the agreement that we've all 
made.

3395
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,670
We've given up a little slice of 
freedom.

3396
02:30:14,940 --> 02:30:17,810
And so because some monkeys want to go 
on one guy,

3397
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:23,780
one man,
let me think about all the people that 

3398
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:23,910
have done fucked up shit on planes.
It's an for whatever reason,

3399
02:30:23,911 --> 02:30:28,911
our fear of flying,
which is very real along with the 

3400
02:30:28,911 --> 02:30:32,160
terrorist need to send a big message by 
making a huge event happen.

3401
02:30:32,610 --> 02:30:34,760
Planes like a perfect thing for that,
you know?

3402
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:36,720
And so that's why we got to watch out.
It's like,

3403
02:30:36,721 --> 02:30:41,721
it's too good for it.
So we to put air marshals up there as 

3404
02:30:41,721 --> 02:30:45,021
dudes are secretly a cops that are 
hanging out with reactionary to a time 

3405
02:30:45,021 --> 02:30:46,290
where room.
Can you spawn air marshals?

3406
02:30:46,291 --> 02:30:49,350
Do you ever seen one seen someone's gun 
or anything like that?

3407
02:30:49,351 --> 02:30:51,740
Like peeking out from other shoulder 
notice?

3408
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:57,190
Either when I feel like fake.
They're always the ones that are always 

3409
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:58,440
sitting on the plane before.
You don't know why that wasn't.

3410
02:30:58,590 --> 02:30:59,520
Yeah.
But how,

3411
02:30:59,521 --> 02:31:00,810
what?
Why would they do that?

3412
02:31:01,050 --> 02:31:03,360
Then you would know what you think they 
would go.

3413
02:31:03,361 --> 02:31:06,260
They would they be in first class or 
they'd been way back way,

3414
02:31:06,270 --> 02:31:08,340
way back.
But I know a couple people that actually

3415
02:31:08,341 --> 02:31:12,090
sat down next to him and they talked 
about them being the air marshal too.

3416
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:13,360
That was a dude trying to get some 
poster.

3417
02:31:13,361 --> 02:31:13,650
Yeah.

3418
02:31:14,030 --> 02:31:16,180
Really what?
I'm out here for freedom.

3419
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:18,500
Where the girls told you?
Yeah.

3420
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:19,980
Fighting for freedom.
I want to

3421
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,890
see my gun zip.
Oh that's not my gun.

3422
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:23,670
But you could hold that.
Just lock the door.

3423
02:31:24,090 --> 02:31:26,310
Just locked the door in the bathroom and
saying cockpit.

3424
02:31:26,490 --> 02:31:28,080
Oh that's not that easy.
What if everybody.

3425
02:31:28,460 --> 02:31:33,460
He locked the door,
the plane lands everybody insides debt 

3426
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:34,630
that went and fucking kill everybody and
then they can't take over the planet.

3427
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:35,580
Everyone died anyway

3428
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:37,250
when died.
Anyway,

3429
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:42,260
they opened up the door and everybody,
those kills the guy spending on locking 

3430
02:31:43,081 --> 02:31:44,220
the door.
I just shot you theory.

3431
02:31:44,221 --> 02:31:49,221
Full holes employed a navy seal.
I'm saying as opposed not as opposed to 

3432
02:31:49,221 --> 02:31:49,800
the air marshal as opposed to all the 
fucking things they do with that.

3433
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,890
There was a good book called the strain,
I should say.

3434
02:31:52,891 --> 02:31:55,020
It was a half of a good book.
It was.

3435
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:58,740
It started off really good and then it 
turned to shit towards the end.

3436
02:31:58,741 --> 02:32:00,780
It was almost like he just wanted to 
finish it.

3437
02:32:01,170 --> 02:32:05,750
So they just like it was.
I'm not Benito del Toro was,

3438
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:10,580
who's that fucking director?
Did Pan's labyrinth or labyrinths that,

3439
02:32:10,850 --> 02:32:12,260
that,
that name that we're,

3440
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:13,440
um,
what's that guy's name?

3441
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:16,660
Guillermo Labor.
And what is elaborative?

3442
02:32:16,750 --> 02:32:21,750
Feminist Library.
That's one of those words that I never 

3443
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:21,750
say I only want.

3444
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:25,130
I read a few words were you like,
I don't think I've ever asked him.

3445
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:28,340
Try to throw that into a sentence like 
dystopian.

3446
02:32:28,750 --> 02:32:33,750
I mean,
I know how to say that because it's 

3447
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:33,750
fairly easy,
but we'll at Berlin.

3448
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:33,980
This.
What was that?

3449
02:32:33,981 --> 02:32:34,910
Uh,
what's that dude's name?

3450
02:32:34,911 --> 02:32:39,911
Guillermo del Toro.
Wiremold toe at the beginning of the 

3451
02:32:39,911 --> 02:32:44,261
book is fucking bad ass and starts off 
with a plane and I started talking to 

3452
02:32:44,261 --> 02:32:46,250
everybody in a plane being dead.
I can't figure out what the fuck happen.

3453
02:32:46,251 --> 02:32:47,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

3454
02:32:48,410 --> 02:32:50,690
But the kind of puts it vampires.
They don't have big fangs.

3455
02:32:50,691 --> 02:32:54,100
They have like this thing was like,
no,

3456
02:32:54,110 --> 02:32:54,590
no,
no.

3457
02:32:54,650 --> 02:32:59,010
The other one strand the strain.
It's all a book.

3458
02:32:59,330 --> 02:33:00,940
Was that a Michael Crighton book?
No,

3459
02:33:01,810 --> 02:33:05,030
I'm thinking of something else where 
maybe it's not the strain.

3460
02:33:05,570 --> 02:33:08,960
Guillermo del Toro.
Hey Guillermo,

3461
02:33:09,740 --> 02:33:14,740
I,
I'm reading a book that you would 

3462
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:14,740
fucking love,
um,

3463
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:17,060
the uh,
sex at dawn guy on your,

3464
02:33:17,061 --> 02:33:18,920
on your podcast as well.
Yeah.

3465
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:21,500
Keep telling me that he was great.
We had,

3466
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:23,740
we got them a little too high.
Really got it.

3467
02:33:23,770 --> 02:33:28,370
I guess that aren't used to it.
That can like a

3468
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:29,360
yes,
go under.

3469
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:31,640
I think me and Brian like it a little 
too much.

3470
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:33,680
You like it?
The strain?

3471
02:33:33,790 --> 02:33:35,060
Oh,
the strange name of the book.

3472
02:33:35,061 --> 02:33:40,061
I was right.
I think we like it a little when we see 

3473
02:33:40,061 --> 02:33:40,061
a guy falling apart.

3474
02:33:40,061 --> 02:33:40,290
You like it.
This is like,

3475
02:33:40,330 --> 02:33:42,030
there's something about seeing that we'd
hit.

3476
02:33:42,031 --> 02:33:43,410
I'm like,
and you just,

3477
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:46,440
you just hear that fucking sunshine on 
my love song.

3478
02:33:48,050 --> 02:33:49,030
Doot,
doot,

3479
02:33:49,090 --> 02:33:49,860
doot,
doot,

3480
02:33:49,890 --> 02:33:53,190
doot.
Do you just see the fear grip them?

3481
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:55,620
Sometimes you can't see it in people or 
they're just like,

3482
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:57,300
you're like,
you've been acting weird and like,

3483
02:33:57,360 --> 02:33:58,330
oh,
you're super stone.

3484
02:33:58,331 --> 02:34:01,500
That's what we did is we used to dis 
will use to encourage it.

3485
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:02,800
It's sort of my same year approach

3486
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,110
to,
to uh,

3487
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,950
mushrooms.
I used to encourage it.

3488
02:34:05,951 --> 02:34:07,930
I used to say come on and get high with 
us.

3489
02:34:07,931 --> 02:34:08,920
No,
you'll be fine.

3490
02:34:08,921 --> 02:34:10,750
You'll be fine.
Not Everybody's going to be fun.

3491
02:34:11,150 --> 02:34:12,490
We're smoking if you'd like somebody 
going out there.

3492
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:13,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

3493
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:18,600
I mean we've got people that like,
seem like they would be like big time 

3494
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:21,571
stoners.
These are all the time we were getting 

3495
02:34:21,571 --> 02:34:25,351
is like really high grade shit.
And if they're not on a medical program,

3496
02:34:25,421 --> 02:34:30,421
who knows,
they might be getting weed from a 

3497
02:34:30,421 --> 02:34:30,421
friend,
you know,

3498
02:34:30,421 --> 02:34:30,700
they might have like a little bit like,
hey we smoke weed every now and then.

3499
02:34:30,850 --> 02:34:31,750
Which,
what does that mean?

3500
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:34,190
It might mean like the way I drink,
like if,

3501
02:34:34,490 --> 02:34:36,850
if I'm going to go out I might have a 
beer or two,

3502
02:34:36,910 --> 02:34:39,970
but I don't sit at home and drink beer 
at home,

3503
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:42,190
but I'll get high and right.
You know,

3504
02:34:42,191 --> 02:34:45,160
my body's used to getting high.
Like I know what I'm doing when it comes

3505
02:34:45,161 --> 02:34:47,620
to my body goes,
I know what to do with this.

3506
02:34:47,710 --> 02:34:49,900
We're good.
But to a lot of people,

3507
02:34:49,901 --> 02:34:52,570
this is like a once a week thing.
Once every two weeks.

3508
02:34:52,571 --> 02:34:54,040
Things and you,
you know,

3509
02:34:54,041 --> 02:34:55,030
you try to keep up with

3510
02:34:55,260 --> 02:35:00,260
can captain silly and he passes you that
choice with a silly little.

3511
02:35:02,070 --> 02:35:03,140
We have like one hit,

3512
02:35:03,210 --> 02:35:04,620
like I'm good.
Like what are you talking like,

3513
02:35:04,621 --> 02:35:08,130
oh you know your limits and you go down,
you concentrate on the fucking cat.

3514
02:35:08,131 --> 02:35:11,580
He's going to cat on his shirt with a 
suicide vest.

3515
02:35:12,190 --> 02:35:15,580
But I ain't got to be so high one in 
Calabasas.

3516
02:35:15,581 --> 02:35:20,581
I fell asleep at a light red light.
It's like a man.

3517
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:23,140
I think I smoked too much.
I'm like,

3518
02:35:23,170 --> 02:35:24,070
no,
this shit's not.

3519
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:29,800
You don't have the good stuff.
It was like the strongest way to do that

3520
02:35:30,641 --> 02:35:34,700
shit to people now that's rude.
I err on the side of caution and I think

3521
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:36,430
already what?
You weren't smoking weed back then?

3522
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:39,070
Like not as much anymore.
Once in a long while.

3523
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:41,050
Once every couple of months or 
something.

3524
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:42,700
It was,
it wrecked me.

3525
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:44,880
I remember when you just completely.
Yeah,

3526
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:46,930
getting hydrated every day.
I go,

3527
02:35:46,931 --> 02:35:48,220
well how long have you been doing that?
About a month.

3528
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:48,730
A little bit.

3529
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:52,780
That was really funny.
I was like,

3530
02:35:52,781 --> 02:35:53,720
well,
what made you,

3531
02:35:53,721 --> 02:35:54,670
uh,
what made you change?

3532
02:35:54,671 --> 02:35:55,630
I'll never forget this.
He go,

3533
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,450
I try to have more fun.
Hi.

3534
02:35:59,140 --> 02:36:01,810
I'm having more fun than my fucking.
I got this gift,

3535
02:36:01,811 --> 02:36:04,150
big care package to you and Eddie went 
into Atari.

3536
02:36:04,151 --> 02:36:05,590
His old place.
Yeah.

3537
02:36:06,010 --> 02:36:07,060
And I at the time of year,

3538
02:36:07,260 --> 02:36:12,260
my license.
And it was my first hire ever been to 

3539
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:12,260
the weed store that no one knew.
So I was in there like,

3540
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:12,500
oh my God,
I'm in a store,

3541
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,810
I should just leave,
I shouldn't like infringe on anybody's.

3542
02:36:16,010 --> 02:36:21,010
And then at some point he's making care 
packages for you and for Eddie and the 

3543
02:36:21,010 --> 02:36:22,230
guy behind the counter goes,
so I make one for this other guy too.

3544
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:24,170
And he's like,
yeah,

3545
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:25,580
yeah.
Everybody kept packages.

3546
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:28,380
So I had like six,
eight different strains of weed at home.

3547
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:30,450
And if I don't have to save it for 
anything,

3548
02:36:30,451 --> 02:36:31,290
I'll go through it.
Yeah.

3549
02:36:31,291 --> 02:36:32,730
That guy got out of the business,
right?

3550
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:33,630
Yeah,
I think he's out of the business.

3551
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:35,160
I think they all get out of the 
business.

3552
02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:40,230
Yeah.
They're trying to figure out what the 

3553
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:40,830
hell they're going to do in Washington 
state now and in Colorado because of the

3554
02:36:40,831 --> 02:36:44,190
legality issues that go in there and 
fucking march on Washington.

3555
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:49,340
The real question is who's going to be 
the first crazy fuck to open up a store 

3556
02:36:49,340 --> 02:36:51,720
and try to sell weed because it doesn't 
seem like you can sell it.

3557
02:36:51,960 --> 02:36:55,650
It seems like you could have it and it's
legal to have and you can grow it.

3558
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:57,660
It's legal to grow like up to a certain 
amount of plants.

3559
02:36:57,661 --> 02:36:59,090
I think they made it.
Yeah know,

3560
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:04,100
like a reasonable amount,
like five or six plants or something 

3561
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:06,081
like that,
but what you can't do is you can't sell 

3562
02:37:06,081 --> 02:37:06,081
it.
Selling it as an issue.

3563
02:37:06,081 --> 02:37:10,690
It's not legal to sell now,
which is really defeats the purpose of 

3564
02:37:10,690 --> 02:37:14,250
the idea of legalization should be taxed
revenue man or one of them anywhere.

3565
02:37:14,310 --> 02:37:16,610
He should not legal your right.
One of them.

3566
02:37:16,790 --> 02:37:18,170
Good point.
Very good point actually.

3567
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:19,610
Yeah.
It's a.

3568
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:21,620
They should be able to make money off 
that man.

3569
02:37:21,621 --> 02:37:24,580
The state should make money and it 
shouldn't be something that benefits not

3570
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:26,500
just the growth of your own self.
Well,

3571
02:37:26,510 --> 02:37:28,190
listen man,
there's a budweiser plant.

3572
02:37:28,520 --> 02:37:30,200
I'm in Van Nuys.

3573
02:37:30,910 --> 02:37:35,910
I pass by it all the time.
It's like one that Grove Budweiser on 

3574
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:42,550
only refreshing buds.
That's great that that Budweiser plant.

3575
02:37:42,570 --> 02:37:45,330
I think it's in.
Van Nuys is great for the community.

3576
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:46,600
It's a big,
big.

3577
02:37:46,601 --> 02:37:51,601
I mean the employees,
a lot of people that require that money 

3578
02:37:51,601 --> 02:37:51,601
for their livelihood,
right?

3579
02:37:51,601 --> 02:37:53,250
Employs.
Who knows how many people.

3580
02:37:53,251 --> 02:37:54,750
It's a huge,
huge builder,

3581
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:56,580
a giant parking lot.
I can only imagine.

3582
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:59,370
Nothing wrong with Budweiser.
Okay,

3583
02:37:59,580 --> 02:38:04,410
but why can't we'd have that same sort 
of status in a community?

3584
02:38:04,411 --> 02:38:07,890
Like why wouldn't it be looked on the 
law the way it should be like that.

3585
02:38:07,891 --> 02:38:12,891
It's a commodity now.
Like you can help the in the 

3586
02:38:12,891 --> 02:38:12,891
neighborhood.
It can help.

3587
02:38:12,891 --> 02:38:12,891
I mean if we have the.
Oh,

3588
02:38:12,891 --> 02:38:17,100
there's a big weed farm here.
They employ like 700 people in this 

3589
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:17,720
community and know everybody's fucking 
waving,

3590
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:19,560
but it makes a good living.
They're selling weed.

3591
02:38:19,580 --> 02:38:21,930
The government gets the tax revenue from
it.

3592
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:27,260
That is so possible and it's really kind
of amazing that it's taken this long 

3593
02:38:28,051 --> 02:38:33,051
before.
Just the seeds get planted for that to 

3594
02:38:33,051 --> 02:38:36,561
be possible because the amount of money 
that a community could make off of 

3595
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:38,840
selling marijuana and the amount of tax 
revenue,

3596
02:38:38,850 --> 02:38:43,850
you get it.
You could literally change agricultural 

3597
02:38:43,850 --> 02:38:43,850
area.

3598
02:38:43,850 --> 02:38:45,150
She would just have to have the FDA step
in a little bit.

3599
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:48,740
Make sure people aren't growing and like
really shitty conditions with Salmonella

3600
02:38:48,741 --> 02:38:50,030
can get out or anything like that.

3601
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:55,500
Well,
they need to like look at shitty 

3602
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:56,380
conditions for a lot of different foods 
that we ingest on a regular basis.

3603
02:38:56,381 --> 02:39:01,381
Mycotoxins are something that we've.
This stuff that I'm drinking this 

3604
02:39:01,381 --> 02:39:03,180
bulletproof coffee stuff that the shit 
coffee.

3605
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:04,030
No,
this is.

3606
02:39:04,031 --> 02:39:07,510
I'm trying to not drink starbucks.
I love you.

3607
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:09,700
You're very convenient.
However,

3608
02:39:09,910 --> 02:39:14,910
according to the Dave Asprey,
there is a very common to have 

3609
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:18,961
mycotoxins which are fungus,
like different types of toxic fungus 

3610
02:39:20,501 --> 02:39:22,930
that grows on coffee.
They also grow on corn.

3611
02:39:22,931 --> 02:39:27,910
They grow in a bunch of different things
and he says that one of the bad feelings

3612
02:39:27,911 --> 02:39:32,911
that you get from drinking coffee,
it's because your body is dealing with 

3613
02:39:32,911 --> 02:39:34,340
the fact that you just ingested a bunch 
of boys and feelings from coffee.

3614
02:39:34,341 --> 02:39:35,930
That I get the greatest feelings ever.
Summer.

3615
02:39:35,950 --> 02:39:36,670
No,
I have.

3616
02:39:36,671 --> 02:39:41,671
I have.
I've actually gotten like sleepy after 

3617
02:39:41,671 --> 02:39:42,070
drinking coffee before and I can never 
understand what the fuck that was.

3618
02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:43,450
And someone said it's because you had 
80.

3619
02:39:43,451 --> 02:39:46,720
Yeah.
That doesn't work with this stuff.

3620
02:39:46,721 --> 02:39:51,721
I don't get sleepy when I take this 
stuff because the extra stuff is put in 

3621
02:39:51,721 --> 02:39:51,721
there,
you know?

3622
02:39:51,721 --> 02:39:55,411
It's because mycotoxins occur when the 
coffee beans are not processed 

3623
02:39:55,511 --> 02:40:00,511
correctly.
That between the time of growing them 

3624
02:40:00,511 --> 02:40:00,550
and between the time you getting them 
somehow or another,

3625
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:05,560
they sat in a funky place.
They develop some mold and that shit's 

3626
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:07,510
not good for you.
This stuff that he gets is from a single

3627
02:40:07,511 --> 02:40:12,511
source.
It's like the company that grows it 

3628
02:40:12,511 --> 02:40:12,511
packages it and they take care of 
everything.

3629
02:40:12,511 --> 02:40:14,910
They make sure that they have very non 
life conditions,

3630
02:40:14,911 --> 02:40:16,620
you know,
whatever the fuck they use to do that.

3631
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:22,070
He swears by that and now when I drink 
this stuff and it also has grassfed 

3632
02:40:22,070 --> 02:40:25,680
butter in it and you blend it and butter
and mct oil,

3633
02:40:25,770 --> 02:40:27,180
which is what's the grass fed butter?

3634
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:32,240
Grass fed butter is butter that comes 
from grass fed cows because apparently 

3635
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:36,540
all the cows that we're getting from 
milk and all the cows that we're getting

3636
02:40:36,541 --> 02:40:41,541
for food for the most part,
unless you're looking for grass fed 

3637
02:40:41,541 --> 02:40:42,780
meat,
they're eating corn and corn is not what

3638
02:40:42,781 --> 02:40:44,930
a cow supposed to eat.
When cows eat corn,

3639
02:40:44,931 --> 02:40:47,670
they get fat as fuck.
That's why they so delicious.

3640
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:49,920
When they get all those layers and 
marbles,

3641
02:40:49,921 --> 02:40:54,921
you know,
you get a nice fat steak and it's got 

3642
02:40:54,921 --> 02:40:54,921
all that marbling,
it'll cook sop and Oh,

3643
02:40:54,921 --> 02:40:56,220
it's popping in juicy.
Getting hungry.

3644
02:40:56,221 --> 02:40:57,210
Look at.
You're excited.

3645
02:40:57,750 --> 02:40:59,370
Well,
that's not normal.

3646
02:40:59,490 --> 02:41:02,850
When a cow has is grass fed,
they have much less fat.

3647
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:04,940
I mean they have like a little bit of 
fat on there,

3648
02:41:04,980 --> 02:41:07,740
but they're far more lean and it's a 
really different kind of tasting meat.

3649
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:10,200
It's much healthier system.

3650
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:12,680
Yes.
It actually works to burn fat it,

3651
02:41:12,690 --> 02:41:15,250
it builds muscle better.
It's a tremendous like,

3652
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:18,930
like people were athletes swear by the 
effects of grass fed meat.

3653
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,480
It's just very expensive.
Now.

3654
02:41:20,910 --> 02:41:23,130
Would that help you if you just ate it 
once in a while?

3655
02:41:23,131 --> 02:41:24,990
It was.
Got to fully switch like gluten,

3656
02:41:24,991 --> 02:41:29,991
we're gonna have to get completely 
edited system before you start saying 

3657
02:41:29,991 --> 02:41:29,991
that affects.
Um,

3658
02:41:29,991 --> 02:41:32,430
I would think that if you want to get 
the utmost benefit,

3659
02:41:32,431 --> 02:41:37,431
you would want to take it completely out
of your system and then you could still 

3660
02:41:37,431 --> 02:41:37,431
have cheat days,
but like it,

3661
02:41:37,431 --> 02:41:40,170
would it be worth somebody for somebody 
once in a while when they can be like,

3662
02:41:40,171 --> 02:41:41,910
you know what,
give me the grass fed beef still.

3663
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,710
Yeah.
Why don't I don't hear it every day,

3664
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:46,280
but I try to eat it as much as I can.
I,

3665
02:41:46,460 --> 02:41:46,950
I,
you know,

3666
02:41:46,951 --> 02:41:48,750
I just,
it's really inconvenient.

3667
02:41:48,750 --> 02:41:50,640
That's the problem.
It's hard to find,

3668
02:41:50,641 --> 02:41:53,850
but it's way more common than it was 
just a few years ago.

3669
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:58,050
People because of guys like rob wolf 
because of guys like Dave Asprey,

3670
02:41:58,070 --> 02:42:03,070
who is a huge,
huge proponent of grass fed meat and 

3671
02:42:03,070 --> 02:42:03,520
grass fed milk and grassfed,
uh,

3672
02:42:03,730 --> 02:42:04,370
the,
the,

3673
02:42:04,460 --> 02:42:07,890
the butter that you get from it.
Like the butter that you get from a corn

3674
02:42:07,891 --> 02:42:10,980
fed cow is sick and so it's different.
Yeah.

3675
02:42:11,050 --> 02:42:13,200
The butter tastes different.
It's got a weird sort of a,

3676
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:18,620
I dunno,
it was just a slightly different flavor 

3677
02:42:18,620 --> 02:42:18,620
to the butter,
slightly different flavors.

3678
02:42:18,620 --> 02:42:21,750
It's been able to roam out fruit groves 
because they're free roaming.

3679
02:42:21,870 --> 02:42:26,870
The meat tastes different game and the 
color is different.

3680
02:42:26,980 --> 02:42:29,310
Yeah.
Oh really?

3681
02:42:29,311 --> 02:42:29,820
Yeah,
I,

3682
02:42:29,821 --> 02:42:34,821
I,
I thought that was because there were 

3683
02:42:34,821 --> 02:42:34,821
weak bitches.
I was like this little pussy ass.

3684
02:42:34,821 --> 02:42:36,420
They don't eat insects.
Yeah.

3685
02:42:36,421 --> 02:42:41,421
This,
the type of wild insects and larva and 

3686
02:42:41,421 --> 02:42:41,680
shit that they dine on,
you know?

3687
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:47,420
Yeah.
That's what apparently a changes the 

3688
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:47,420
color,
their flesh salmon.

3689
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:48,900
So they should have that.
They're also dyed pink.

3690
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:49,770
Yeah.
But no,

3691
02:42:49,771 --> 02:42:49,950
no,
no,

3692
02:42:49,951 --> 02:42:54,951
but those are,
those are the reasons why they died and 

3693
02:42:54,951 --> 02:42:58,190
those are the ones that are pawn fed Sam
and apparently something along those 

3694
02:42:58,190 --> 02:42:59,610
lines.
But apparently like nutrition wise,

3695
02:42:59,790 --> 02:43:04,790
it's really not that much a difference.
A real like a lot of people think there 

3696
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:04,790
is.
But then again,

3697
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:06,540
I mean I don't know exactly what you're 
measuring when you.

3698
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:11,130
I mean how many salmon filets get broken
down by vitamin content?

3699
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:12,490
How often are they doing that?
I mean,

3700
02:43:12,491 --> 02:43:17,491
what,
what control group where they work in 

3701
02:43:17,491 --> 02:43:17,491
front,
you know,

3702
02:43:17,491 --> 02:43:17,850
what tests that they've done on salmon.
Am I just talking out of my ass?

3703
02:43:17,870 --> 02:43:19,660
Ari?
Fear control of it,

3704
02:43:19,661 --> 02:43:20,410
right?
Yeah.

3705
02:43:21,410 --> 02:43:26,410
I Dunno.
I just can't think those pellets can be 

3706
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:26,410
as good as all those bugs they eat.

3707
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:26,410
Yeah,
that's probably better.

3708
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:28,990
That's an actual.
When wild salmon tastes better.

3709
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:31,720
Does it tastes different?
It tastes different.

3710
02:43:31,770 --> 02:43:36,770
Yeah.
Saw that juicy bug juice you're getting 

3711
02:43:36,770 --> 02:43:36,770
in there.
Delicious bug juice.

3712
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:37,660
Well,
I,

3713
02:43:37,661 --> 02:43:38,260
I,
you know,

3714
02:43:38,261 --> 02:43:40,090
a lot of people don't like the taste of 
game.

3715
02:43:40,240 --> 02:43:45,240
You know,
a lot of people like they think that 

3716
02:43:45,240 --> 02:43:45,240
Venice and tastes funky and I've never 
had bear.

3717
02:43:45,240 --> 02:43:47,920
Have you ever had parents who.
Where's who sorts bear?

3718
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:51,240
You've got to go somewhere.
Special Shit.

3719
02:43:51,490 --> 02:43:53,920
According to Steven now,
who'll be on the podcast Monday.

3720
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:55,360
Hala.
Praise Odin.

3721
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:57,700
A corner.
Steven Rinella.

3722
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:02,470
If a bear is eating blueberries and the 
spring fucking delicious.

3723
02:44:02,770 --> 02:44:07,770
You said when they get out of there,
right when they get out of their dens 

3724
02:44:07,770 --> 02:44:08,710
and they start eating massive amounts of
blueberries.

3725
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:11,200
Apparently they taste so good.
The bear does.

3726
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:16,230
Yeah.
If you find a baptist near blueberries 

3727
02:44:16,230 --> 02:44:16,930
and they eat a shitload of blueberries,
that's most their diet like blue flesh,

3728
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:19,960
like they're fat,
they're fat is like blue,

3729
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:21,760
like he saves their bear fat.

3730
02:44:22,190 --> 02:44:24,830
He's seems like cooks with it and shit.
Yeah.

3731
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:26,650
Yeah.
Apparently it's unbelievably good.

3732
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:27,370
Like,
but,

3733
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:32,580
but it can vary.
Like if you get a bear and like New 

3734
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:34,890
Jersey,
like you apparently don't like to eat 

3735
02:44:34,890 --> 02:44:34,890
brown bears.
People like to eat black bears.

3736
02:44:34,890 --> 02:44:36,580
Brown bears don't taste good because 
brown bears are mostly predators.

3737
02:44:37,150 --> 02:44:38,670
So they're full of meat.
Yeah,

3738
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:40,120
they're full of meat.
They're mostly,

3739
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:43,090
there are a lot of them are full of fish
like grizzlies,

3740
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:46,060
but a black bear.
A lot of what the is vegetables.

3741
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:51,480
So when you,
when you get them and they eat like a 

3742
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:52,150
lot of blueberries are delicious.
But if they're eating like your garbage,

3743
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:57,180
like you know,
suburban New Jersey has a real problem 

3744
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:57,180
with bears and just eat whatever they 
can find.

3745
02:44:57,180 --> 02:45:01,770
Black bears get into suburban 
neighborhoods like place where like Jim 

3746
02:45:01,770 --> 02:45:05,430
Brewer lives and shit like that.
And they go and they tip over garbage 

3747
02:45:05,430 --> 02:45:08,851
cans and they just eat all of the 
people's food and they become a real 

3748
02:45:08,851 --> 02:45:11,521
problem because once they know that they
can come into a neighborhood and eat 

3749
02:45:11,521 --> 02:45:13,060
garbage and everybody's a little bit 
through anything.

3750
02:45:13,150 --> 02:45:18,150
So they.
So they opened up hunting season on 

3751
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:18,150
them.
So when they open up hunting season,

3752
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:22,201
um,
then people went out and hunted these 

3753
02:45:22,201 --> 02:45:23,701
bands,
but they found out the bears that were 

3754
02:45:23,701 --> 02:45:23,830
near people that tasted like shit 
garbage,

3755
02:45:24,130 --> 02:45:24,640
you know,
they're,

3756
02:45:24,670 --> 02:45:29,670
they're just fucking donuts and whatever
the fuck they find in a parking lot 

3757
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:29,750
somewhere and never see the wild boys 
were,

3758
02:45:29,751 --> 02:45:34,751
they were,
they had tried to lower bear into their 

3759
02:45:34,751 --> 02:45:34,751
tent.
Yeah.

3760
02:45:34,751 --> 02:45:36,790
Those were like that video,
that chick doing the back flip.

3761
02:45:36,791 --> 02:45:41,791
I could barely watch him.
Look what the fuck do you ever see the 

3762
02:45:41,791 --> 02:45:42,700
one where they were throwing a ham 
around and these hyenas,

3763
02:45:42,701 --> 02:45:44,520
they're playing.
Keep away.

3764
02:45:46,210 --> 02:45:47,570
We're trying to.
We're trying to eat it.

3765
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:48,880
They're nipping at them.

3766
02:45:51,490 --> 02:45:54,460
Can literally break right through your 
arm.

3767
02:45:54,780 --> 02:45:58,630
It would just bite through your arm and 
your hand would fall one side.

3768
02:45:58,750 --> 02:46:03,750
And the rest of your arm would go lamp 
and they would take that piece out of 

3769
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:04,720
the middle out and it'd be gone.
And it's cool.

3770
02:46:04,750 --> 02:46:06,370
That's the heinous.
Now snap.

3771
02:46:06,460 --> 02:46:08,400
Wow.
Fuck that.

3772
02:46:08,410 --> 02:46:13,410
I love that.
How about the one when he got up in the 

3773
02:46:13,410 --> 02:46:15,560
tree and the lion climbed up and got on 
top of him and just started touching his

3774
02:46:15,561 --> 02:46:20,480
hat and didn't kill him.
Remember that Brian on the podcast.

3775
02:46:21,340 --> 02:46:26,340
So great.
I got so close so many times out of his 

3776
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:27,380
fucking mind.
Fucking mind in jacket.

3777
02:46:27,381 --> 02:46:32,381
He hooked himself or the nipple with a 
hook and then they us for real man by 

3778
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:38,250
his guys are so nice.
I know.

3779
02:46:38,470 --> 02:46:40,760
When did that become cool to like hurt 
yourself?

3780
02:46:40,850 --> 02:46:41,390
Scare me.

3781
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:43,340
Yeah.
But why?

3782
02:46:43,360 --> 02:46:43,790
What,
what,

3783
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:45,020
what?
America was ready for it.

3784
02:46:45,150 --> 02:46:46,790
I got rid of Tom Green where it's like,
oh,

3785
02:46:46,791 --> 02:46:48,410
we love these things,
but this is victim us.

3786
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:53,430
We want to be seen enough.
Alright Ladies and gentlemen,

3787
02:46:54,140 --> 02:46:56,270
let's bring this bitch home.

3788
02:46:56,390 --> 02:46:57,350

3799
02:47:20,330 --> 02:47:22,430
very happy with this fellow.
I'm super stoked man.

3800
02:47:22,431 --> 02:47:23,630
I was really happy.
It was all my fans.

3801
02:47:23,631 --> 02:47:25,250
It's all different than comedy central 
ones.

3802
02:47:25,410 --> 02:47:29,750
They don't tell you what to do,
what to just you do it on your own sense

3803
02:47:29,810 --> 02:47:30,440
of free.

3804
02:47:30,770 --> 02:47:33,110
It's beautiful.
We live in amazing times,

3805
02:47:33,111 --> 02:47:33,610
man,
for,

3806
02:47:33,611 --> 02:47:38,000
for artistic creativity,
for freedom,

3807
02:47:38,001 --> 02:47:43,001
for to be able to put your own shit out 
there and to be able to do like what 

3808
02:47:43,001 --> 02:47:43,001
we're doing right now.
You know,

3809
02:47:43,001 --> 02:47:47,790
we have like a legit show somehow or 
another that reaches millions of people 

3810
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:49,970
somehow or another,
you know,

3811
02:47:49,971 --> 02:47:52,470
and through that platform,
you know,

3812
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:54,340
you really could do what you want,
you know,

3813
02:47:54,440 --> 02:47:59,440
and I'll be in Edmonton at the comic 
strip through in that material was 

3814
02:47:59,440 --> 02:47:59,440
almost thought 90 percent of that 
material.

3815
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:00,640
So see it there for.
Yeah,

3816
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:05,680
go see it there.
First you fox because he's not going to 

3817
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:06,680
be out on video you can download until 
February fourth.

3818
02:48:06,681 --> 02:48:09,110
So you've got to give them time to come 
up with some new shit.

3819
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:10,780
I mean he just recorded it.
Okay.

3820
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Don't get a lot of you comedy nerds 
skill touchy about the new material and 

3821
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:16,950
cut the guy some slack,
you know,

3822
02:48:16,980 --> 02:48:19,010
don't feel like some of your bits.

3823
02:48:19,010 --> 02:48:24,010
And I'm like if you saw one of my bits,
it might've been maybe one come back to 

3824
02:48:24,010 --> 02:48:26,930
the second show and say the same thing 
twice in a weekend,

3825
02:48:26,931 --> 02:48:31,931
which I don't,
I don't usually I have one that I'm 

3826
02:48:33,471 --> 02:48:34,850
working on.
You fucker.

3827
02:48:35,500 --> 02:48:39,080
I'm a thank you to everyone for 
supporting the podcast.

3828
02:48:39,081 --> 02:48:43,070
We appreciate the fuck out of it and I 
appreciate even even the criticism.

3829
02:48:43,071 --> 02:48:44,390
I really do.
Without it,

3830
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:46,160
I would like criticism wouldn't be as 
good.

3831
02:48:48,110 --> 02:48:49,330
That's cool.
Thank you.

3832
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:54,520
It's just people that get angry like so 
many people were angry at me because of 

3833
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:54,520
the loon talk,
you know,

3834
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:55,610
look,
you don't have to get angry.

3835
02:48:55,611 --> 02:48:57,680
It's stupid.
You're getting a free podcast.

3836
02:48:57,830 --> 02:49:00,670
There's don't need to be angry.
Oh yeah.

3837
02:49:00,680 --> 02:49:05,680
You like it.
You don't like it if you have something 

3838
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:07,121
constructive.
I really do believe that all of the 

3839
02:49:07,121 --> 02:49:07,121
constructive criticism that I've ever 
heard,

3840
02:49:07,230 --> 02:49:10,800
whether it was from my time time hosting
that fear factor,

3841
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:16,070
whether it's from doing the UFC 
commentary or whether it's from doing 

3842
02:49:16,070 --> 02:49:19,671
comedy,
I really believe that that's made me 

3843
02:49:19,671 --> 02:49:19,671
better at what I do.

3844
02:49:19,671 --> 02:49:23,030
Even some of the country shit,
it's like puts things just to know that 

3845
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:25,230
someone could see you that way.
Valid or not.

3846
02:49:25,940 --> 02:49:26,490
Uh,
so,

3847
02:49:26,491 --> 02:49:28,380
uh,
go check it out on twitter.

3848

3849
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:38,360
He drops bits of knowledge all 
throughout the day and he's a real 

3850
02:49:38,551 --> 02:49:43,551
inspirational sort of a character.
Like the other day someone was asking 

3851
02:49:43,551 --> 02:49:46,551
for babysit advice and he said,
call Casey Anthony the way to go,

3852
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:50,270
son of a,
B,

3853

and I'll be in Chicago with Joe Rogan.
Yeah,

3854
02:49:52,291 --> 02:49:53,730
that's right.
We're going to be in Chicago.

3855
02:49:53,731 --> 02:49:55,260

02:50:05,821 --> 02:50:08,420
Aka Joey Diaz.
And uh,

3861
02:50:08,460 --> 02:50:13,460
just uh,
you could find that shit on ticket 

3862
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:13,460
master or you can go to my twitter.

3863
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:14,100
You could find it up there or you can go
to Joe Rogan.net,

3864
02:50:14,101 --> 02:50:19,101
my newly redesigned website.
And from there you can actually buy my 

3865
02:50:19,101 --> 02:50:19,930
new comedy special.
Oh yeah.

3866
02:50:19,931 --> 02:50:24,931
I guess I'm supposed to be promoting and
it's five bucks drm free.

3867
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:27,430
It's the best shit I think I've ever 
for.

3868
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:32,600
It means you can put it on any device.
You can download a copy it I just asked.

3869
02:50:32,791 --> 02:50:37,791
Please don't steal it.
Don't put it on a torrent site or 

3870
02:50:37,791 --> 02:50:37,791
anything like that.
That's your best one you've ever done?

3871
02:50:37,791 --> 02:50:37,791
I think so,
yeah.

3872
02:50:37,791 --> 02:50:39,270
I think I'm better now than I've ever 
been before.

3873
02:50:39,390 --> 02:50:42,710
Definitely had the most experience being
a comic on this one.

3874
02:50:43,290 --> 02:50:45,060
I mean,
I liked my last one.

3875
02:50:45,061 --> 02:50:46,590
I really liked shiny,
happy jihad.

3876
02:50:46,591 --> 02:50:48,240
I really liked talking monkey's in 
space.

3877
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:51,110
Like I think everything that I've done 
since I stopped doing fear factors,

3878
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:52,280
my best stuff,
you know,

3879
02:50:52,470 --> 02:50:54,360
from that 2006 on.

3880
02:50:54,370 --> 02:50:54,780
Yeah,
yeah,

3881
02:50:54,781 --> 02:50:55,440
yeah,
definitely.

3882
02:50:55,441 --> 02:50:57,240
But I think this is the best one at all 
of them.

3883
02:50:57,660 --> 02:50:59,400
I just think I'm better at it,
you know?

3884
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:03,600
It's just a matter of spending time and 
practice reaction has been really good.

3885
02:51:03,690 --> 02:51:04,130
Yeah,
man,

3886
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:06,510
it's been almost universal.
I'm super,

3887
02:51:06,511 --> 02:51:07,710
super,
super happy with it.

3888
02:51:07,950 --> 02:51:10,740
Some people,
there's a few complaints only that I had

3889
02:51:10,741 --> 02:51:13,020
talked about some of the subjects on the
podcast,

3890
02:51:13,021 --> 02:51:18,021
but that's impossible to avoid.
I'm doing podcasts for three hours a 

3891
02:51:18,021 --> 02:51:21,471
day,
so when you care about this stuff you 

3892
02:51:21,471 --> 02:51:23,240
talk about on stage,
it's going to bleed over to regular 

3893
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:23,240
conversations because you're not making 
it up because your real feelings.

3894
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:23,730
Yeah,
yeah.

3895
02:51:23,731 --> 02:51:24,660
No doubt.
No doubt.

3896
02:51:24,750 --> 02:51:29,750
I mean it's a.
This whole podcast connection with 

3897
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:32,991
standup is it was very unexpected and 
start off a bit on the podcast and be 

3898
02:51:32,991 --> 02:51:32,991
like,
oh,

3899
02:51:32,991 --> 02:51:33,240
let me think more of that.

3900
02:51:33,890 --> 02:51:36,480
You saw the first germination of an idea
all the time,

3901
