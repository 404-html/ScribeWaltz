1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,440
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,330
Joe Rogan podcast by nine,

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,600
ladies and gentlemen,
the drunken himself,

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,180
Danieli Bolelli my friend.
How are you?

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,920
Pleasure and honor to be.
Or again,

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,570
always a pleasure and honor to have you 
here,

7
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:25,190
brother.
House going.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,390
If you hear anything in the background,
some giggling.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,870
Danielle,
these beautiful little daughter is here 

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,670
to babysit and plans didn't work out so 
we'll,

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,270
we'll make it happen.
But I'll feel weird about swearing.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,340
Well,
you should see what comes out of her 

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,340
mind with on a regular basis.
So yeah,

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,791
my daughter gives me a hard time or my 
wife rather gives me a hard time for 

15
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,690
swearing in front of our daughters.
It's like there's like some period where

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,750
your is a certain point in time.
We not allowed to swear.

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,990
When they hit like 18,
you can say whatever the fuck you want 

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000
anything before.
Then people get a little squirrely.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,600
Of course

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,010
it's hilarious because you know you 
can't help it.

21
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:01,660
You know you're going to listen to some 
music.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,760
You're gonna not even crazy stuff,
but like,

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh yeah,
she like Katy Perry at some point and so

24
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:07,540
I'm like,
okay,

25
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:12,541
whatever.
Are you listening to your song and then 

26
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:12,541
she was a steal a couple of years ago.
She was tiny.

27
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:17,460
She goes into school and she started 
singing to her teacher and their 

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,460
teacher's like,
oh,

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,130
cute song.
You have such a beautiful voice,

30
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,400
and she started going like upms like a 
beach.

31
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,060
I should know.

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Please do you know the pc police is 
trying to take the word bitch out of our

33
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,590
vernacular,
which is the latest one.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,880
Align the new retard W.
I won't let go.

35
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,360
Retard.
I don't care what you say.

36
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,070
It's not a medical term.
It's,

37
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,780
it's no,
it's to retard is to slow down,

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,840
is to be behind the curve.
To be retarded is to be slow.

39
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,090
It has nothing to do with down syndrome 
or any diseases I may have to abandon 

40
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,540
eventually,
but for right now,

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,810
fucking staying strong,
staying strong with retard and I'm 

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:01,810
staying strong with pitch.
What's bad with bitch?

43
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,780
Exactly.
Well,

44
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:07,781
it's a derogatory term for females.
It's part of the Patriarchy to engender 

45
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,200
stand.
You know,

46
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:11,270
you'd done understand because you're a 
white male.

47
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:13,490
You need to check your privilege.
Mr Kelly,

48
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,460
have you not checked your privilege?
Yeah,

49
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,320
I saw your tweet about checking your 
pedigree,

50
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,990
realized I was thinking about checking 
my privilege yesterday.

51
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,570
I didn't though.
I thought about it.

52
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:27,640
I thought about the fact that he 
wouldn't be.

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,800
Even though it's a way that people can 
silence you.

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,060
I mean that's essentially what it is.
I mean the idea behind it has some 

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,060
merit.
You know,

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,631
the idea that there are people that have
privilege in life and they need to 

57
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,940
understand that.
I think it's a valid term when you're 

58
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,601
talking about minorities and poor people
and people on welfare and people in 

59
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,960
foreign countries that have no 
healthcare and they're poor,

60
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,980
I believe support 100 percent that,
but it gets used a crutch to silence 

61
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:05,131
people and it gets used as a crutch for 
people who lack the intellectual vigor 

62
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:06,880
to engage in an honest debate and 
discussion.

63
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,830
They say,
you need to check your privilege.

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,940
I love watching videos of people that 
are just really not that bright,

65
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,690
but they're like getting involved in 
those debates and they have that weapon.

66
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Check your privilege.
It's like it's like a fighter that 

67
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,060
doesn't really know how to box,
but as an awesome overhand,

68
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:27,061
right.
That overhand rights in the other boxes 

69
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:31,020
like pitch,
get out of here with that overhand 

70
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,581
right.
I didn't see that shit coming a mile 

71
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:32,581
away.
Check your privilege.

72
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:35,050
So not that easy.
You're fucking argument sucks.

73
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,140
No,
I mean I get it because there are the 

74
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,140
people who are,
oh,

75
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,150
you know,
we live in a colorblind society.

76
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,160
Everything.
There is no more risk season.

77
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:47,161
We can all be equal and if you are 
trying to argue anything but you are a 

78
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:51,241
reverse racist,
then I can see how some of these guys 

79
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:53,491
that are addicts themselves because they
are ignoring the fact that there's a 

80
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:55,870
whole history behind it and when they 
say we started the race evenly,

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,270
it's like,
well somebody has their shoots.

82
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,220
Things tie together for 50 years,
bullshit not.

83
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,660
And so he's like,
no,

84
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,610
the reason the way you've been raised,
that's bullshit.

85
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:11,611
But at the same time when you turn 18 to
everything is about what happened 200 

86
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:12,640
years ago is like,
come on man.

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,520
It's a fine balance there.
There's a website that a twitter handle 

88
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,050
that I don't,
I don't follow them on twitter because I

89
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,520
don't want them to know that I follow 
them,

90
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,030
but what I did is I bookmark them and I 
go to her page all the time.

91
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,480
That's.
And her thing is about being child free,

92
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,630
Hashtag child free and I mean this 
woman's entire fucking twitter feed is 

93
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:40,771
all about how happy she is that she 
doesn't have a child and it's one of 

94
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:40,970
those,
you know,

95
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,500
me thinks the does protest too much.
You know,

96
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,420
it's like when you go to it,
it's like,

97
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,530
oh my God,
like is this,

98
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:51,280
your whole existence is like being happy
that you don't have a child.

99
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,030
Like this is so bizarre.
It's a bizarre hang up,

100
00:04:55,031 --> 00:05:00,031
but that bizarreness is that,
that's a characteristic of human beings.

101
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Like they can get caught up in a bunch 
of different weird ways of thinking and 

102
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,841
one of them can be just fucking 
meandering on and on constantly about 

103
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:12,310
racial issues.
Oh yeah,

104
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,770
of course.
And it works.

105
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,610
By the way.
Have you seen Al Sharpton's girlfriend?

106
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,740
Jesus?
Louisa.

107
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,420
Really?
Oh my God.

108
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,040
That good?
Oh my God,

109
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:26,041
she's a fucking 10,
a young 10 with their arms around this 

110
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,170
crusty old dinosaur fucking suitcase.
Pimp will have these sharp on the Dead 

111
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
Sea.
It is Lee officially dead.

112
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,060
I don't know.
Fucking thousand.

113
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,040
Seven hundred and 50.
He's disgusting.

114
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,130
He's just a creep.
He's just a suitcase pimp,

115
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,690
you know?
It was just one of those guys.

116
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,691
It's just a hustler.
He figured out his way through that 

117
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:49,720
Tawana Brawley case where it was some 
false rape accusations.

118
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,340
He was blaming all these white people.
It's again,

119
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,840
it's the same thing.
Race,

120
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,880
pimp.
Look at her kapow.

121
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,330
Oh,
oh.

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,030
And that's just one picture.
By the way,

123
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,260
this is a weird thing that happens with 
people's heads when they lose weight.

124
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,990
You when people get really fat,
their heads get big.

125
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,110
That's how sharp sharp to now.
He lost a lot of weight.

126
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:12,820
He has stomach stapled and that's only 
one photo over.

127
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,980
She's 35 years.
Ah,

128
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,680
well,
good for.

129
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,960
Yeah.
What do they talk about?

130
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,210
Crayons.
Shit.

131
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,950
She's not that young.
Actually.

132
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,380
Thirty five is pretty stylish.
Beautiful.

133
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,090
Somebody is not watching their little 
show.

134
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,690
Somebody is sitting in Danielle Ebola,
his lap,

135
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,840
Kiehl's demons or no,
she's.

136
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,850
She's done.
Didn't say hi to everybody.

137
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,540
Okay.
I'll hug you the whole time about that.

138
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,390
You can sit in my lap.
Watch your show.

139
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,660
Be the first show ever were a little kid
is here during the podcast.

140
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,100
Yeah,
that should be.

141
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,080
You're so cute.
I'm going to have to let it slide.

142
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm going to have to just these ones to 
watch TV or anything.

143
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,500
What time?
Well,

144
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,820
right now it is a 1:10.
You can watch tv if you want.

145
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,820
Do you want to?
She's watching her show mode or less.

146
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,430
That was when my daughter was three was 
one of the coolest moments ever.

147
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,560
My daughter was three wounds.
Skin.

148
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,110
I took their scared.
Skim Skim when?

149
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,180
When one daughter was two and the other 
one was for.

150
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,980
That's when I started skiing.
Yeah.

151
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,270
I just think it's good to just get kids 
doing shit as much as possible.

152
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,470
I'd take them to dance class and 
gymnastics and I teach them martial 

153
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,341
arts,
but I think it's good to just get them 

154
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:45,071
used to traveling and doing things,
but when she was three we are putting 

155
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:50,381
all this stuff into her little bag and 
she's a little badge carriers how we 

156
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:53,741
travel and she likes to pull her own bag
and she didn't have her helmet in the 

157
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:58,121
bag and she had everything zipped up and
right when she finished up and I'll buy 

158
00:07:58,121 --> 00:07:58,121
my honey didn't put your helmet and she 
goes,

159
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:03,060
shit,
something so adorable.

160
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,060
I bought a three year old gone and my 
wife and I would just like,

161
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,150
oh no,
she didn't do it right.

162
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,860
So what's that?
Bid Sees what I.

163
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,550
The deal that I struck with her was,
I don't care if you do it around me.

164
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,290
I get it.
That light to wait too.

165
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,510
But you do not.
There are places.

166
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,480
Where do you do at school?
Around other kids.

167
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:26,800
He,
Frodo,

168
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,900
fewer teachers?
No,

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,150
I told him so one day we were driving 
home from school and she let slip up,

170
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,790
something like that.
I,

171
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,930
she does shit and I'm like,
is she looked at me?

172
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:36,920
He's like,
don't worry,

173
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,880
I don't say it.
That's cool.

174
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,370
I just say here and I'm like,
okay,

175
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,810
that's fair.
And so she sees that she had to go ahead

176
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:45,600
and so she liked.
She just kind of got.

177
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,220
Yeah.
It's um,

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
it's tricky because it's a totally 
acceptable for adults in normal 

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,970
rational,
but you know,

180
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:01,320
it's not in certain circles.
It's that whole thing.

181
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:06,321
The whole censorship in language thing 
is such a bizarre aspect of being a 

182
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:10,491
human being.
These forbidden words that we use that 

183
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:10,800
essentially are interchangeable with 
words that are okay.

184
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Like what drives me crazy is when 
someone goes fricken fricken guy with 

185
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,240
his fricking thing,
like I hated nuts.

186
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,270
Oh whoa.
What kind of bizarre corporate world we 

187
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,761
live with Applebee's existence.
Are we floating through here fricken 

188
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:25,761
night?
That I should be nuts.

189
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,460
It's weird.
It's weird and it's why.

190
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,820
I mean,
I don't Overdo,

191
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,730
wait,
the fight can check it out,

192
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,240
but I don't try to censor myself around 
there in anything you do in anything 

193
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,120
that I do is kind of like dc is how I 
am,

194
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,450
right?

195
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,470
This is.
I'm now going to out of my way to make 

196
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,470
it extra weird.
But I'm like,

197
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,430
oh I am is I am.
And I like talking to kids.

198
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,390
Not exactly like they are adults because
I'll do today aren't right.

199
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,610
But at the same time,
not treating them like they are fucking 

200
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,011
stupid.
Where are you just studied them like a 

201
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:58,011
Google God,
that kind of stuff all day long.

202
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:58,380
It's like,
come on man,

203
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,800
it kids that are way smarter than.
You'll give them Canadian too.

204
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,200
And if you,
if you work with them like that from the

205
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:09,201
get go,
they will surprise you with time and 

206
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:09,201
time again with the stuff that they can 
say back to you.

207
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh,
without a doubt.

208
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:14,961
I remember when I was a little kid,
people I still to this day remember 

209
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:15,930
people treated me like I was more on and
talking to me stupid.

210
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm gonna.
Remember thinking why?

211
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,010
When I have kids,
I'm never talking to them like that,

212
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,960
so I talked to my kids like they're my 
friends,

213
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,020
like I'm very sweet to them and very 
nice and very understanding if they're 

214
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:28,920
crying about something that doesn't make
any sense,

215
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,410
but I,
when I explain something to them,

216
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,860
I explained it to them like an adult and
I know their heads only that big,

217
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,250
so it can't possibly be smartest man.
Smart man.

218
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,830
They are my six year old can read now.
Wow.

219
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,950
Which is interesting because I had a 
shirt on the other day that said nine 

220
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:48,980
fucking oranges because,
uh,

221
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,720
I had this a bit in my act is based on a
true story where,

222
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,760
um,
I had my,

223
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,510
a power cut off in my house because I 
didn't pay my bill.

224
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,460
In fact,
when I was young I was very responsible.

225
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,130
I wasn't even broke.
I just didn't pay my bill.

226
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,050
And so the guy came by and turn the 
power on.

227
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,240
It seemed like a nice guy.
And after we turned the power on and go,

228
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:11,241
hey man,
I had an orange tree in this yard of 

229
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:11,241
this House I was renting.
And I go,

230
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:12,090
if you want to grab one of those 
oranges,

231
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:12,450
man,
I go,

232
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,670
they're really delicious.
And he goes,

233
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,040
oh,
okay,

234
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:19,041
thanks.
So the guy goes out there and he takes 

235
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,520
nine fucking orange and I swear to God,
man,

236
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,290
I was 20,
I want to say maybe 26,

237
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:30,291
27 time.
That was 20 years ago and to this day 

238
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:33,570
there's still times I'm in my car and 
I'll be driving around.

239
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:38,520
I'll just go nine fucking orange and 
talked about it on stage.

240
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,010
And it's really true.
It is a true story.

241
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:46,011
And so this dude gave me this tee shirt 
at one of my shows that just said nine 

242
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:46,011
fucking orange.

243
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,540
Orange is on it.
I wish I had it on right now.

244
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,580
That's great.
But I,

245
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,850
I worked for one of the shows,
one podcast I worked for.

246
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,030
But anyway,
uh,

247
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,410
I,
I brought it home and my daughter goes,

248
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,680
I know what that says.
That's a bad word.

249
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,400
Bad word.
That's a bad word.

250
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:07,401
A busted.
Why didn't even know she knew that word 

251
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:09,430
first of all.
I mean she's the are a couple of once in

252
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:11,860
a tiny moment.
My wife runs a tight ship.

253
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,170
Really?
I try to.

254
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,270
I try to keep it,
keep it very pg.

255
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,990
You can try only once,
but that our thighs.

256
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I remember when she was tore something 
where I drop something and for the rest 

257
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:27,430
of the day she went on repeating doc doc
doc and I'm like,

258
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,420
I'm glad you think it's a doc.
What I say,

259
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,180
yes,
that's what I said.

260
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,420
What I ended up and it's like there's no
way.

261
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,020
No Way.
It's impossible.

262
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,150
Yeah,
there it is.

263
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,540
Brian Cowen,
Bryan countered I nine fucking orange.

264
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,150
I see the fucking is covered by my name,
but it's nice when I said that wasn't 

265
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,020
Brian Count when I got back from a 
hunting.

266
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,740
So that one was before hunting or 58 
after.

267
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:54,490
Yeah,
yeah,

268
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,590
no,
we did two,

269
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,990
two podcasts in row.
One before and one after hunting.

270
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,290
We went up to this island,
Prince of Wales in the middle of Alaska.

271
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,640
Terrible trip.
The well,

272
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,680
it was beautiful though.
It was beautiful.

273
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:11,080
It was a great trip.
It was just unsuccessful hunting trip,

274
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,380
but there was.
What was great about it was when I came 

275
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,720
back home,
I really appreciated civilization.

276
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,670
Oh yeah.
I really.

277
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,370
We slept in a tent.
It was wet.

278
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,320
Everything was wet.
Sleeping bag was wet.

279
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,980
It was just.

280
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,260
It was miserable.
It's like 40 degrees.

281
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,150
Just poured every day.
It was so much humidity that like inside

282
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,350
the tent,
like I would turn.

283
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,980
I had this little miner's light.
Anything like a forehead light.

284
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,490
I turned it on and you'd see the entire 
tent was filled with little floating 

285
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,030
beads of water.
It was just that much humidity in there.

286
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,350
When did you guys go with the first week
of October?

287
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,400
It was too late.
Yeah,

288
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,480
it's late.
Yeah.

289
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,510
It was too late for the area that we 
were hunting in because the deer had 

290
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:54,880
already moved down.
We were at the top where the water is,

291
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,920
where the lakes are,
and the deer had already moved down.

292
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,620
There's water up there.
Lakes that have no fish,

293
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,860
giant lakes that are lakes that are only
there because of rainwater.

294
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,650
Wow.
Giant lakes of rainwater and he drank it

295
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,580
because there is no beavers.

296
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,430
He just dip your thing right in the 
water.

297
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,000
We drink right out of the lake.
That's beautiful in itself is beautiful.

298
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,950
It is.
It's amazing in that sense.

299
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:17,000
Like I was prepared for diarrhea 
everyday.

300
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,200
I bet that it never came.
They were saying if you get Giardia,

301
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,290
like you wouldn't get Giardia.
Giardia comes from animal poop and the 

302
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,280
only way you would get that as if there 
was a beaver up there,

303
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,930
but um,
you could like run into a bear and bear 

304
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,200
could have pooped in there because 
that's a bear poop in your mouth.

305
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,250
Yeah,
that would be.

306
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Yeah,
I can see how it sinks would be more 

307
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:38,700
fun.
Yeah.

308
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,701
But it's such an enormous lake.
The odds of you getting any substantial 

309
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:41,701
amounts.
I mean,

310
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:46,500
the reality is unfortunately we're 
constantly getting fecal matter and 

311
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,540
stuff in your body and like,
even if you're a person who only eats 

312
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,201
plants,
they say that one of the best ways that 

313
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,641
vegans get vitamin B 12 is from bugs 
that they inadvertently eat that are on 

314
00:14:58,581 --> 00:14:59,210
their food.

315
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,540
Just kind of hilarious that the other 
day I handed out this glass of wine to 

316
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:09,671
this lovely lady and she grabbed it and 
she goes about this secret and she 

317
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:09,950
looked and she's like,
oh,

318
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,010
there's a bag inside,
and she handed it back to him and I 

319
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,291
think I was already buzzed.
Then after that I look at it and was 

320
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:17,291
like,
just shrug my shoulder.

321
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,340
I'm down the bug into wine,
and it was tasty.

322
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,280
Nice.
Bugs don't taste nearly as bad as people

323
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:23,960
think.
They do take it from me.

324
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,070
From my days at fear factor I have.
I've eaten quite a few bugs.

325
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,230
It's more in your head?
Yeah,

326
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,500
there's anything.
I mean I wouldn't go for like nasty.

327
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,440
We are looking cockroach from outer 
space kind of thing,

328
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,450
but you know,
little box or whatever.

329
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,280
No big deal.
I had a Madagascar hissing.

330
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,290
Cockroaches like the site,
remember pagers.

331
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,010
That's a pager.
That's Matt,

332
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,420
giant Madagascar,
hissing,

333
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,920
cockroach.
I think they were referred to.

334
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,480
That's pretty good.
Australian,

335
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,580
they're not bad man.
Now was.

336
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,230
I guess you know what it is,
is not.

337
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,330
The thing itself is what he does.
Crawled through.

338
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,340
It's all in your head.
Yeah.

339
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,800
It really is all in your head with was 
crawl through.

340
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,580
Yeah.
Disgusting.

341
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,520
But the ones that we got,
they were raised on a farm,

342
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,570
you know,
they were raised for movies and stuff 

343
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,400
like that for show business.
It's really in decades,

344
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,570
ultra sun,
let's say.

345
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,830
Isn't that amazing that there's so many 
cockroaches,

346
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,860
there's so much of a need for 
cockroaches that there is someone who 

347
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:20,860
raises them for television that I've 
never heard before.

348
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,940
Crazy.
That's that seed that is take the ride 

349
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:25,940
and they would have millions of them.
Man.

350
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,070
These guys that have cockroaches.
But I was around them so often it just 

351
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,400
became nothing.

352
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,560
Right.
And I've watched people eat them and you

353
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,510
know,
I forget what it was.

354
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,860
Oh,
it was um,

355
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,400
one of the girls from a soap opera.
It was like a celebrity fear factor and 

356
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,031
I made her a deal that if she ate,
she ate one of the cockroaches to move 

357
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:50,171
on,
that I would eat a cockroach and she 

358
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:50,270
wouldn't even eat a cockroach.
She ate a worm instead.

359
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,870
Like I would rather eat a roach than a 
worm.

360
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,020
But even from my book,
see a boardroom I think is filled with 

361
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,020
dirt.
Yeah,

362
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,120
probably.
I mean the dirt.

363
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,180
But then again it could approach is not 
exactly a rap being himself day and 

364
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,070
night and taking showers is.
I'm telling you,

365
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,900
eating,
it was like,

366
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,490
it was very,
like no taste at all.

367
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,090
Very mild.
Just exploded in my mouth and I crunched

368
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:15,650
it.
But it was a very mild.

369
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,260
Like if I had to,
if I was starving,

370
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:22,370
I would eat a bowl of those things.
No problem.

371
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,010
If they're starving,
I think that are too many things.

372
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:29,960
That one doesn't say.
It makes you a gag a little just because

373
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,530
it just feels gross in your mouth.
Reality of like the actual flavor of it.

374
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,210
It's not that bad.
Not too bad.

375
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,780
Nice.
It's not.

376
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,160
No worries.
Yeah.

377
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,070
People are saying that in other 
countries that bugs are becoming like a 

378
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,890
viable form of protein.
Oh yeah.

379
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,980
They say it's really clean.
Protein is less fattening than most 

380
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:50,980
other types of proteins.
So

381
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,070
yeah,
if you can get over the disease grows 

382
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,070
supposed to be actually good for you.
Yeah,

383
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,580
probably not.
Just less fat.

384
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,650
I mean,
how much fat is in a bug?

385
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Yeah,
I would imagine next to nothing super 

386
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:03,680
lean,
right?

387
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Yep,
Yep.

388
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,090
Yep.
So they even have like cricket,

389
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,660
like snacks that you can buy.
I'd like hiking places.

390
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,880
The SELAC please.
Cricket bars.

391
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,150
I've done that before.
There wasn't a sound coming out of her 

392
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,150
ears.
Ear Buds.

393
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I was wondering what that was.
I thought maybe someone was outside 

394
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,720
cranking music of these things fell off 
and I need to just.

395
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,490
Okay.
You come to listen to the other one.

396
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,290
I'll just.
A lot of days went up.

397
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,120
She's so adorable.
It's all right,

398
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,590
man.
Yeah.

399
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,620
I had that before with a friend of mine 
was from Wahaca,

400
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,990
Mexico and so one of their traditional 
thing,

401
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,620
they will have this entire plates field 
with crickets and you know,

402
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,140
he didn't grow up where you grew up out 
here.

403
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,880
Right.
His parents are all into that stuff.

404
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:47,970
So one day he's like,
I have to try after try he order a seat.

405
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:51,420
That is what huck and restaurant.
And he just looked at it and I could see

406
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,540
he's about to throw up like any cycled 
that.

407
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,660
Right.
He's just like,

408
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,440
come on,
it's not that bad and I have to say 

409
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,170
them,
you can eat them,

410
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:06,171
but I can think of about 10,000,
572 things that are better than that are

411
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,020
not the tastiest in the world and you,
they look at you,

412
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,620
they are,
they are not that tidy so they have 

413
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:15,620
their eyes so that you can clearly see 
them.

414
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm crunching on some creek.
A tie right now is it?

415
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,230
But why is that?
Why is that gross?

416
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,060
But like a lobster is okay.
No,

417
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,560
I mean there are some stuff that I agree
with you some seeing sir.

418
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,830
It's thought that social conditioning 
season you just broke up with the idea 

419
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,730
that that's normal and that it's normal,
but otherwise it's not.

420
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:35,400
It's just as we are,
does a bunch of other stuff.

421
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Yeah,
because I mean essentially like crabs 

422
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,531
and lobsters and crustaceans,
they're really like bugs are bugs that 

423
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:46,191
just live in the ocean or water bugs and
lobster or one of the few things that I 

424
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:51,291
can't quite.
I mean the whole thing of boiling them 

425
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:51,580
alive.
That freaks me out really.

426
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,800
I mean,
other stuff,

427
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:54,120
he's like,
I have no problem.

428
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:56,010
You know,
you second the hunting thing,

429
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:56,700
you know,
you go out,

430
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:59,700
you hand and anamolies footy as a good 
life and you killed them.

431
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,920
You eat them.
Totally make perfect sense to me.

432
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,790
Boiling alive.
Something actually involving torture to 

433
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,210
make sure that you get to eat it.
I feel like I can't eat something else.

434
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,320
You know?
I can eat and again,

435
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,410
it doesn't have to be a vet I can eat.
I have no problem with the whole eating 

436
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,880
meat thing or writing or any of that.
Just the pain of pirates.

437
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,170
She's like,
come on man.

438
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,610
Well,
if it makes you feel better,

439
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:24,060
they say that lobsters lack the nerve 
endings to feel pain.

440
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:24,870
Really?
Yeah.

441
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:29,871
It's.
Will they also regenerate limbs and 

442
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:29,871
stuff?
A lobster loses a leg.

443
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:32,610
It just grows rack in that case.
But you're on the lobster.

444
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,650
Yes.
If you really wanted it humanely,

445
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,651
eat lobster,
you just hack their arms off and they 

446
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:42,171
just keep letting them grow their arms 
back clause.

447
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,580
You could do that.
It would work.

448
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:46,890
I don't know how long it would take to 
regenerate a claw,

449
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:48,280
but they,
they regenerate

450
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,250
the same way like crocodiles.
Do they regenerate as well?

451
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,680
Some lizards do.
I remember when I was a kid,

452
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:58,681
I went to,
my maternal grandfather was in by the 

453
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:00,340
seaside and you know,
I would hardly ever see him.

454
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,860
So it was kind of a new thing and he was
already weird enough.

455
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,380
And when they um,
I'm thirsty,

456
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,330
I wake up in the middle of the night,
I go to the fridge,

457
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:09,910
I opened the fridge and he's fucking 
giant lobster,

458
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:14,911
jump out of the features,
start running away because I was like,

459
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,880
what the hell out.
The weird thing about lobsters is they,

460
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:26,241
they live in the ocean,
but you can ship them in a box and they 

461
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:28,510
don't even have to be in water and they 
get to you,

462
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:32,350
like from Maine and they're all live 
everyday in Vegas.

463
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:35,230
They have lobster shipped in from Maine 
to the restaurants.

464
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,520
Just like how the hell,
like how the,

465
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,860
what are these things like they don't 
even have to breathe.

466
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,110
I know like how many days can they go 
without breathing?

467
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,570
I have no idea,
but it's freaky is definitely fakey.

468
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,090
Yeah,
freak as it comes.

469
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,240
She needs some sort of a television show
for this to work television show right 

470
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,240
there.
She's not watching.

471
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,780
Watching.
It's more interesting to interrupt.

472
00:21:58,781 --> 00:21:59,950
We should have worked this out,
man.

473
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:04,951
I would've brought my kids over.
Then you could have a little party and 

474
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:07,500
we just heard yelling and fucking play 
would have been wild and crazy over 

475
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,920
there.
Yeah.

476
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,050
I don't know what it,
what it feels,

477
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:16,051
but the one thing I do know is when you 
throw a lobster in the water and the 

478
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:16,051
water boils,
they tried to get out.

479
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,410
Yeah.
So I'm not buying it.

480
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:18,760
Yeah.
I don't buy it either.

481
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,570
It sounded a little weird to me.
The convenient thing that people say,

482
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,620
it's like,
no,

483
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,360
they don't feel anything.
They like it.

484
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:26,980
Actually.
It's like a sonar to them.

485
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:31,981
You know?
It's like they have these pleasant sawn 

486
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:34,390
and all of a sudden the day die 
peacefully and go to lobster heaven and 

487
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,280
all is good to hear music and they just 
expire.

488
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,370
They want to go to their dad.
Relative lobster was been in your Paul 

489
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,920
to before and they are uniting lobster 
heaven and all is well and a well.

490
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,010
One thing that is interesting about like
prey animals like deer and antelope and 

491
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,551
stuff is that they believe now that like
when an antelope gets captured but like 

492
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:57,310
a lion or something like that.
Then when the lion bites down on it that

493
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:00,460
it's brain floods with chemicals and an 
almost sort of gives up,

494
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,770
like it kicks a little bit,
but it just sort of gives up and it 

495
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,821
doesn't fight like ses if lack of a lion
captured like a Predator,

496
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:14,350
you know,
some other Predator like a leopard or 

497
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:14,350
something like that.
They would fight for their rights.

498
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,830
They would go crazy and make screaming 
noises and everything.

499
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,890
But antelopes just like,
oh,

500
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,970
this is just my place in the world to 
pray.

501
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,230
I got cold,
so okay,

502
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:26,140
I'll check it out next to life.
We'll see soon.

503
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,850
Come back as a draft or some shit.
What's your take on that kind of stuff?

504
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Do you,
do you actually send my believing 

505
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:35,880
reincarnation w what's your take?
Um,

506
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,110
I don't not believe in it because I 
think the idea of life itself is so 

507
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,590
bizarre.
The idea that we have a soul,

508
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,740
that we have consciousness that we can 
see through our,

509
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,530
that we navigate with sound and feel and
memory.

510
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,040
I mean,
it's,

511
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,300
it's so,
so,

512
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:54,320
so bizarre that reincarnation is not 
outside of the question.

513
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,960
I mean,
I don't,

514
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,840
I don't know if there is such a thing as
a soul.

515
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,350
I don't know what this life is.
I don't know.

516
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:08,280
Like there's this life.
Is this a finite experience where you,

517
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:13,281
you're born and then you die?
Or are you drifting in and out of 

518
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,820
parallel experiences every time you go 
to sleep and wake up.

519
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,090
I mean,
are you on the same timeline constantly 

520
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,360
when you wake up and you have this 
memory of your existence in this life 

521
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,360
that you,
uh,

522
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,400
are you sure that that's exactly how 
everything goes?

523
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,540
I mean,
just because all the people in your life

524
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,760
seemed to think that that's everything,
how everything goes.

525
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,970
How do you know that you didn't go to 
bed last night with a totally different 

526
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,691
existence and wake up with a memory of 
this life that you're living right now 

527
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,050
just completely embedded in your head.
And we don't know.

528
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,080
That's negative.
Fame.

529
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,090
Moza,
Schwan's when the butterfly,

530
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:46,210
right to the whole,
uh,

531
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,120
uh,
ways to sage,

532
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:48,400
uh,
Twan.

533
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:49,930
So it was all like,
uh,

534
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,640
they asked him about these many say I 
had this dream that I was a butterfly,

535
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:55,580
but now I'm puzzled because I don't 
remember anymore.

536
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,590
I don't know if I'm really transformed.
I was dreaming that I was about their 

537
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,770
flight or if I'm actually a butterfly 
and this is the butterflies dream,

538
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,560
thinking that she's trans.
So.

539
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,440
And that's the paradox off.
You'll never fucking know.

540
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,500
No,
I had a really intense dream once that 

541
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,251
was so realistic that to this day it 
haunts me because I was some sort of an 

542
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:22,891
animal,
like a wolf or something along those 

543
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,430
lines.
And we were sneaking up on this deer and

544
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,020
the deer herd,
like a branch snap or a leaf move.

545
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,940
And I could smell fear.
And I remember smelling fear,

546
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:38,941
like smelling the tingling in this 
animal's body as it was thinking about 

547
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,420
bolting as it was wondering whether or 
not it heard anything.

548
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,600
And I also remember smelling water.
I could smell the water that was 

549
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,600
dripping.
And then I woke up.

550
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,730
I remember thinking like,
what the fuck is going on?

551
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
Because I remember there was other 
similar animals near me,

552
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,090
some wolf like animals near me.
And we were like communicating without 

553
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,040
words in some sort of strange primitive 
way.

554
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,650
It was a very short dream,
but I woke up.

555
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:03,580
But I remember thinking,
wow,

556
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:08,581
that was an intensely realistic 
experience because I didn't feel like 

557
00:26:08,581 --> 00:26:10,210
while it was going on,
I wasn't like,

558
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,700
oh,
I'm a person that thinks it's a wolf.

559
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,610
You know?
It was like I was in this.

560
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:18,700
This animal's mind of course could 
easily be imagination.

561
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,000
Sure.

562
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,230
But then again,
it's some of those dreams.

563
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,450
I know exactly what you mean,
but some of the things that are weird,

564
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:26,780
there's a staff that I know what I've 
experienced.

565
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,480
And then sometimes there's something 
that clicks seen that he's like,

566
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,690
this is not part of my life,
this is what I'm feeling right now is 

567
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,490
way beyond the range of my experience.
This is not part of the game.

568
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,570
And that's what I find.
I find it creepy,

569
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,630
you know,
I find it really interesting like you 

570
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,250
ever seen the legends of the fall,
which I really liked the movie.

571
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:50,850
I could only watch it with at one time 
and I could never watch it again because

572
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:53,430
he freaked the hell out.
There was one scene where,

573
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:58,431
um,
if you guys are gonna Watch legends of 

574
00:26:58,431 --> 00:26:59,250
the fall and you plan to do it,
skip the next main articles.

575
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:03,680
I'm going to give spot from spoiler from
20 years ago.

576
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,670
Not exactly big spoiler,
but there's that scene where,

577
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,710
uh,
Brett's but brother get killed in one 

578
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:13,710
word.
One,

579
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,330
he goes berserk and he kind of goes 
behind enemy lines and he,

580
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:16,600
uh,
end the next CEO,

581
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,760
sees you seek coming back into camp and 
he's covered in blood.

582
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,880
He has a German scalps all over him and 
he's walking through the camp and 

583
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,220
everybody's opening up to let him go 
through nobody's saying award.

584
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,320
There's the sense of,
and there's the sense about him that 

585
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,201
he's kind of larger than life.
He has done this crazy thing of going 

586
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,030
single handedly again,
killing probably 10,

587
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,650
15 guys,
something insane,

588
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,550
and yet there's this sense of extreme 
sadness.

589
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:49,551
Like all that power,
all that warrior ability doesn't give 

590
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:51,360
him what he truly needs,
which he still got back his loved ones.

591
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:56,361
You know that.
So that combination of extreme larger 

592
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:59,150
than life power and torque tragedy that 
you can do,

593
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:01,020
you know,
that hold that power doesn't really help

594
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:01,200
you.

595
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,100
When I saw that scene,
he was so familiar in a way that it's 

596
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,100
not mine,
you know,

597
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,910
it's no out my life up until that point 
that been.

598
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:12,990
He had no parallel whatsoever in my 
experience.

599
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,290
And he wasn't like any other movie where
I see something and he's like,

600
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:21,291
oh cool.
I can kind of relate to that on some 

601
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:21,291
degree.
Any heat me like,

602
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:25,790
oh my God,
I know that feeling so damn well and 

603
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,060
that I think about it like where do I 
know that feeling,

604
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:32,061
you know,
20 years ago or whenever I saw legends 

605
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:32,061
of the fall,
um,

606
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:32,490
and there's nothing in my life to mirror
that.

607
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,600
Not even a tiny bit.

608
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,710
The imagination is such a wonderful,
incredible thing.

609
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,770
It's just,
it's so impossible to really understand 

610
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,010
the boundaries of the imagination and 
people can imagine memories.

611
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,250
I mean,
there's been moments where people have 

612
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,960
been talked into remembering things by 
like through experiments,

613
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,950
like through with,
with someone would counsel them and give

614
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:03,951
them a memory of the past and then coach
them through this memory and then time 

615
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:06,540
will go on and they'll think that that 
was a real memory.

616
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,060
Oh yeah.
And what does that mean?

617
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,140
The imagination itself is such a bizarre
aspect of being a human being.

618
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,290
The ability to like this wolf thing that
I had in my mind essentially that was my

619
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,490
imagination.
I mean,

620
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:25,491
the only other option is what is it a 
suppressed memory from my genetics from 

621
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,600
a long time ago when I was some sort of 
an animal,

622
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:35,630
but you know,
I mean the idea of evolution is 

623
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,781
essentially that human beings in 2014 
are the result of millions of years of 

624
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,730
change,
of natural selection,

625
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:47,731
of all these different slow processes 
that have led us to being this thing 

626
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,090
that we are today.

627
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,600
But this thing has a direct link to 
whatever the fuck survived from that 

628
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,000
gigantic asteroid that hit the Yucatan 
and was what?

629
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,980
Some in one and a half miles deep,
like slammed.

630
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,320
The thing was like five,
five miles deep into the earth within 

631
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,380
the first,
second and a half.

632
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,980
Killed everything.
Everything larger than,

633
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,400
you know me,
I think Mckenna used the term a chicken.

634
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:19,570
Everything larger than a chicken.
So just like as a point of reference and

635
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,350
just weird little mammals,
rat things survived.

636
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,170
So somehow or another from 65 million 
years ago,

637
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:30,470
those weird little rat things that 
survived became CEO,

638
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:30,880
right?
Yeah,

639
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:35,881
exactly.
Hold the my mouse around us as 

640
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:35,881
inevitable.
What is,

641
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,860
you know.
But,

642
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,230
but there's no direct chain to any 
wolves.

643
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,650
There's no direct chain to any mean.
Even the lower hominids were even the 

644
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,420
ones that ate meat.
They did.

645
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,870
There weren't on all four.

646
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,890
They weren't.
So there's no.

647
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,390
I have no past with wolves.
Nope.

648
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,380
So if that's the case,
like what is that thing?

649
00:30:56,381 --> 00:31:01,381
Is that just total imagination?
Is it just the psychedelic chemicals 

650
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,350
that flood your brain during heavy rem 
sleep?

651
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:07,351
Just creating a,
a beautiful image for you to try to 

652
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:12,030
conceptualize and wrap your head around?
Or are you drifting in and out of 

653
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,070
realities?
Are you mean,

654
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,110
are you a monkey one day,
you know,

655
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,160
and then you go to sleep,
you wake up and you've done all,

656
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,790
you have your life and everything is 
normal.

657
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,980
But were,
were you a monkey yesterday?

658
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,150
Probably some would argue that a monkey 
right now,

659
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,760
while everybody argues that,
I mean it's obviously one of those 

660
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:39,001
stoner conversations that you have.
Like how do you know anything about 

661
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:41,110
that?
I don't know what you're saying.

662
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,870
Yeah.
But those,

663
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,380
those conversations are so common.

664
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,430
Like,
how do you know that,

665
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:49,020
you know when you go to bed and you wake
up and more than the youth,

666
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,100
same person,
but you don't know.

667
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,150
And that's the weird thing about going 
to bed is that everyone wants to do it.

668
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,820
Everyone wants to sleep and everyone's 
scared to die.

669
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,660
Everyone wants to shut off temporarily,
but no one wants to shut off 

670
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,050
permanently.
Oh Yep.

671
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,390
Is a very,
very odd existence because you know,

672
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,880
if there were any guarantees,
if throughly people,

673
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:14,970
that's why I don't really buy a lot of 
the religious people think they say I 

674
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,290
believe in an afterlife isn't that is 
like if you're really dgl,

675
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:21,610
it'd be way more relaxed about a lot of 
things in life because you wouldn't have

676
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:22,580
that fear of that is like,
well,

677
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:24,720
do I have to be afraid of.
There's nothing to be afraid of it.

678
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,750
It would be cool.
And he's like,

679
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:26,410
great,
you know,

680
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,240
I do my thing here.
Whenever I check out,

681
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,220
I check out and I go to this other cool 
place.

682
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,250
Evidencing is great.
There's no reason to fear the Fed,

683
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:38,251
that people are obviously not thrilled 
with the notion of dine makes me think 

684
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,860
that they don't believe it half as,
as they actually do it.

685
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,210
Well,
belief systems are very strange.

686
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,400
It can,
it can really seem in your mind to be 

687
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,681
absolutely real and you will explain 
these beliefs to someone else and they 

688
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:56,181
will tell you that you're an idiot.
Like I was on a set once I was doing 

689
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:59,991
this thing and uh,
I was talking to this girl and her 

690
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:00,360
sister,
they seem totally normal.

691
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,810
And then the girl,
I don't remember what we were talking 

692
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,470
about,
it had something to do with gay people.

693
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,420
I don't remember what it was.
It was something like about gay marriage

694
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:17,421
or gay people.
They were talking about how the woman 

695
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:17,740
was saying that it's a sin.
It's.

696
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,820
And I thought she was joking.
I really thought she was joking because 

697
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:22,820
it was a set like intelligence such as 
like,

698
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,280
well,
it's a sin,

699
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,210
it's a sin.
And,

700
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,410
and,
and then I realized she was serious and 

701
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:30,410
I go,
um,

702
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,220
so you think that God created people 
that are gay and then he did it like as 

703
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:35,310
a goof,
like a trick.

704
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,160
Like what is that?
And she goes,

705
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,880
no,
no,

706
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,050
no,
you don't understand.

707
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,530
She said that this the devil scales of 
covering your eyes.

708
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,910
Wow.
And I said,

709
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:49,590
the devil scales are covering my eyes.
I'll never forget that term.

710
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,100
That's the devil scales.
I didn't know the devil Ed scale.

711
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,810
That's when it's starting to run.
What?

712
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,180
No,
no,

713
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:56,520
no.
I mean,

714
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:58,590
she was friendly.
She was just,

715
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,270
um,
who knows,

716
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,110
man,
who knows?

717
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:04,890
There was this girl and her sister and 
the girl,

718
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:08,310
the one that I was originally talking to
seem totally normal,

719
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,380
but her sister was just out to Liz 
launch.

720
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Right.
And that's the devil scales are covering

721
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,460
your eyes.
It was just about gay people.

722
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,050
That's.
No.

723
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,230
Yeah,
that's quite pretty key right there.

724
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,430
You admitted.
But it's like people pick and choose 

725
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:30,430
shit,
man.

726
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:30,430
I know this dude who is really 
religious,

727
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,610
but he has religious tattoos.
Like motherfucker,

728
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:35,270
you gotta read the whole Bible are not 
supposed to text.

729
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,220
I could have read all of it and that's 
supposed to tattoo yourself.

730
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,790
Funny.
In fact to me is like when people say 

731
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,620
either they are pro or against anyone 
really John seely because it's like when

732
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:48,830
somebody tells me they are Christiano or
Muslim or Buddhist or whatever,

733
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:51,890
that maybe he's not telling me anything 
really because as you say,

734
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,500
people pick and choose what they want 
out of that.

735
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,040
So one guy's way of being Christian.
Subtly awesome.

736
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:03,110
There are going to be super nice people 
and their belief system elps them being 

737
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,110
nicer people.
Yeah.

738
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:07,990
The next guy,
the our way of being Christian because 

739
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,691
they pick and choose the crappiest part 
out of the Bible is scary as hell and 

740
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,861
their way of being.
Christian is around 40 or life and also 

741
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:14,861
to me,
the label itself.

742
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:19,631
I'm not interested in an argument about 
whether one religion is good or bad 

743
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:23,560
because the reality is that every one of
them you're going to find at least some 

744
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,890
good part in some.
There's a lot more than in others,

745
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:26,570
but you're gonna find at least a little 
bit.

746
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,600
That's good in just about scene and 
usually I find also tons of crap I'm 

747
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,071
interested in which pirates will peak 
and allow those parts inform your 

748
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:36,630
behavior.
How do,

749
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,280
how do you behave based

750
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,830
on your beliefs?
That's what the interest me.

751
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,940
Yeah.
It's like like the idea of drugs,

752
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,250
like all drugs,
not just drugs.

753
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,420
The idea is like,
you know,

754
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:53,421
I'm,
I'm a religious person or I'm a 

755
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:53,421
Christian.
Well,

756
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:53,421
Fred Phelps.
Phelps was the Christian.

757
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:58,101
Right.
And then there's like rupert sheldrake 

758
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:58,101
is also a Christian.
This very,

759
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:03,230
very different ideologies at work here,
but they're both calling themselves 

760
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,150
Christian and Fred Phelps is just as 
evil mean creepy old fuck.

761
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:11,151
That eventually died.
Is rotted in his own filth and fucking 

762
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:11,640
anger.
Yup.

763
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,490
That's exactly how it is.
That's why to me,

764
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,530
even the whole antireligious,
the watson thing gets through romantic 

765
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,130
because it's like,
oh,

766
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,140
can stay on.
Sorry.

767
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,500
Terrible Muslims are all evil.
It's like,

768
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,960
do you really think every single one out
of millions of people who belong to the 

769
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,520
sinks,
they are all bad people,

770
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,210
man.
It's like there's,

771
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,250
there's the nice lady will pick the 
parts that are all about being nice to 

772
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,411
your neighbor and charity or whatever 
and that's or way of being Christian or 

773
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:43,431
Muslim or Buddhist or whatever the hell 
it is and he's awesome and there's 

774
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:46,731
nothing wrong with deep and he's 
actually pleasant and I'm sure we'd 

775
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:46,731
actually helps our life.

776
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:47,310
Either beliefs,
yes,

777
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,100
those are scary and anybody going by 
those beliefs.

778
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Then you see it in action and is not 
helping an old lady cross the street is 

779
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,930
chopping people set off because they 
don't believe the same thing you do.

780
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,020
That's where you get.
That's the freaky part,

781
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:03,780
but I don't even care what it's people 
and again,

782
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,900
always Saturday about which one is the 
one who does all this shit.

783
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,320
It's not even just 30 days alone because
if you look a communist,

784
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:11,960
dictatorship,
Nazis,

785
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,790
they've all done anything.
The name of it,

786
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
it's totalitarianism.
You know?

787
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:20,241
It's that idea of everybody needs to 
leave according to my way of life and 

788
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:24,100
anybody who doesn't need to be squashed.
That's the scary thing that I got really

789
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:29,101
self,
which a label is attached to it 

790
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:29,510
regardless of which set of clothes.
It's the site aware.

791
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,480
He's the same shit.

792
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,720
Yeah.
Ideologies or they're problematic 

793
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,160
because when you feel like you force 
yourself into like a framework,

794
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:43,161
you force yourself into a pattern.
Anything that's outside of that 

795
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,861
framework is like automatically not to 
be considered and when you have like 

796
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:50,280
rigid thinking anytime you ever really,
except like rigid thinking like,

797
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:52,500
Hey,
you shouldn't rob people.

798
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,240
Hey,
you shouldn't go around stealing.

799
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:56,400
You shouldn't around go around stabbing 
people.

800
00:37:56,401 --> 00:38:01,401
You shouldn't mean there's,
there's rigid things that in a sense 

801
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,551
that like a pretty clear cut.
It makes sense because they're causing 

802
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:04,830
harm and there's.
But there's also,

803
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:09,831
there's ideologies that are just,
you get locked into them and you're 

804
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:12,951
forced to think that way because of it.
Like people that will tell you that this

805
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:17,490
religion is correct because this 
religion is the truth and now they'll,

806
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,490
they'll force themselves to like be 
stuck in that little box.

807
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,510
Right,
and you don't want to admit that you 

808
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,980
ever fucked up and lived 20 years of 
your life believing in some nonsense so 

809
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,820
then you're stuck.
You're stuck in this little box and that

810
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:33,510
could be atheism just as much as it can 
be Christianity,

811
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,530
because I've met a lot of atheists and 
I'm like,

812
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:36,190
listen,
you're

813
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:41,190
in a religion,
you're just going to read the religion 

814
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,230
called atheism and they like want you to
proclaim.

815
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:46,231
You're an atheist.
Like I know this dude that's an atheist 

816
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:46,790
and he gets upset if I say,
I don't know.

817
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:52,220
You know,
I say that to me is the most honest 

818
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,960
thing you can say is on a about a lot 
about stuff of the universities.

819
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,780
I don't know because that's the reality 
of it.

820
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,700
He hasn't had any really extreme 
psychedelic experiences either.

821
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,200
None.
In fact,

822
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,150
he's very smart guy,
but his ideas are like only based on his

823
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:12,151
own personal experiences and what he's 
learned and what he's red and he's a 

824
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:12,850
very smart person.
He's very aware of religion,

825
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,880
but he's like so adamant about 
proclaiming there is no god and I'm 

826
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:18,760
like,
look dude,

827
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:23,761
I have seen things on mushrooms that are
way crazier than an old man with a book 

828
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:28,440
check in your name and the cloud and 
leading you to pearly gates and there's 

829
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,741
a bunch of people with wings.
I've seen some shit that's way crazier 

830
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:32,110
than that so that I don't think that's 
real,

831
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,200
but there's no evidence whatsoever in 
my,

832
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:35,910
uh,
in my estimation that that's,

833
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:41,010
that exists.
But the idea that there might be some 

834
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,580
universal consciousness that we want to 
describe as a god and it's just not this

835
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:49,801
old man in the clouds wearing robes.
It's just something maybe even beyond 

836
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:53,620
the realm of humanity beyond the realm 
of the possibility of us understanding.

837
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,130
I don't see any evidence for that,
but I'm not.

838
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,540
I'm not throwing it out.
Yeah,

839
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:00,050
exactly.
Exactly.

840
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:05,050
I mean,
if somebody and get some crappy 

841
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,050
fairytale that subs really poorly at 
Eaton and his bad screenwriting,

842
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,610
it doesn't take a genius to figure out 
what,

843
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:08,500
okay,
that's just bullshit and I can see it.

844
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,740
But if you define God in some other way,
how the hell do you know that,

845
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,570
you know,
once you're a drag,

846
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:18,370
just the most scholarly type of 
fairytale,

847
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,280
everything else is up for grabs because 
nobody really knows.

848
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:26,281
I mean universities.
That's why to me it's kind of hard to 

849
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:28,981
have the discussions about religions 
even like the books ever written about 

850
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:31,981
religion because usually people don't 
like organized religion is because they 

851
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,770
are big fans of um,
you know,

852
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,840
kind of a hardcore materialist worldview
where it's all about what you can see 

853
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,731
and touch and nothing else exist.
So then you write a book that pleases 

854
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:45,820
those guys and doesn't play the 
religious folks.

855
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,500
That's great.
You still have an audience.

856
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,990
But if you argue for something more sub 
though,

857
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,840
if you argue for sensing that's 
basically not dogmatic,

858
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,280
either religiously dogmatic or in a 
hardcore materialistic form,

859
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:59,920
dogmatic,
then you're shit out of luck in terms of

860
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:00,670
fighting.
And audience,

861
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:05,671
because you are,
there's no niche that you jumping to 

862
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:05,671
right away,
right?

863
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,450
It's not just one simple,
you know,

864
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:10,870
there's those guys that are going to be 
right behind you.

865
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,300
You're asking people to be aware on a 
moment by moment basis so they'd urgent 

866
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,650
just seemingly,
you know,

867
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,950
binding to a dogma,
spouting the ideology,

868
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,960
spouting the disease,
what we believe one,

869
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:27,961
two,
and three year asking people to leave 

870
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:29,800
life without relying on a damn recipe 
that you apply at every little thing you

871
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:33,790
run into when instead you to use their 
notes to use their eyes.

872
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,740
The situation right now I'm able to,
uh,

873
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,260
in this particular case,
I'm going to do what he's saying.

874
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,290
In his other case,
the same thing that work two minutes ago

875
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,510
is not appropriate and it's not the 
right thing to do.

876
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,830
It's kind of like in fighting,
you know,

877
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:48,590
it's like there's a rhythm to things.
There's a timing to things.

878
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:53,510
And going with that plan as a rigid 
plan,

879
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,730
going in with a plan is great,
but going with that are easy to plan.

880
00:41:55,731 --> 00:42:00,731
They are not going to change it 
regardless of what's in front of you is 

881
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:00,731
the recipe for death.
You know,

882
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:00,731
you're gonna.
Ask her up.

883
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,740
Same thing.
Why would the life in general bna 

884
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,540
different region to the applying the 
scheme to everything that comes your 

885
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:08,540
way?
I mean,

886
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,370
to me real talent is,
uh,

887
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,410
is mainly mobile to judge things.

888
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,720
I can hear them.
Fortunately the,

889
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:17,240
her little ear buds are picking up on 
the,

890
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:18,640
uh,
the,

891
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,740
the microphones.
Okay,

892
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,270
let's try it now.
Are you sure you don't want to watch TV?

893
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,470
That's ridiculous.
My kids watch tv every chance they get 

894
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,830
because I don't want to watch tv so I 
can always go.

895
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:34,280
Do you want to watch them to you?
Like it's a book that up?

896
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Yeah.
This is the greatest thing ever for 

897
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:40,560
travel,
man,

898
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,440
for travel.
You put on one of those things behind 

899
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:44,440
the headset and people will go,
oh,

900
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,330
why do that?
Why not have your kids like,

901
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,950
have a conversation with?
She's fucking for that session.

902
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:52,460
Only last so long.
Right?

903
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:57,461
It's just like educational cartoons now.
Cartoons like teach them how to spell 

904
00:42:57,461 --> 00:43:01,250
and teach them and they can sing along 
with it and learn phrases and words.

905
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,510
Do you have you ever heard of.

906
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,950
Well there's atheism obviously,
but there's a thing called atheism plus.

907
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,520
Have you heard of new towels?
New Religion.

908
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:15,690
It's A.
It's atheism plus a set of moral 

909
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,800
guidelines.
I call it de.

910
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,920
This is what I call it because it's like
it's all be a good person,

911
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,490
but I just think that's De,
you know,

912
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,500
and maybe like when it comes to things 
like racism and these sort of 

913
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,061
discussions or homophobia or any,
any sort of discussion about inequality 

914
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:40,460
or treating people in a very negative 
way because of something that they can't

915
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:44,810
control their sexual orientation or the 
way the skin they have,

916
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,030
what color they are,
what part of the world they're from.

917
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,300
I think anybody who's a good person sees
that in 2014 recognizes.

918
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:55,700
That's a fucked up way to think.
So these people,

919
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,520
this atheism plus thing,
they have like atheism.

920
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,250
So they're all saying there's no god,
there's No God,

921
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:05,330
there's No God,
but we want a set of moral guidelines to

922
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:10,331
live our lives by no sexual harassment 
and sexual harassment and feminist 

923
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:14,830
issues are big aspect of that.
It's mostly a lot of like really weak 

924
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:19,091
men,
placating to a lot of like angry women 

925
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:22,060
and they formed this group were they all
sort of get together and they have 

926
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,590
conferences and they just die each other
to death.

927
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,340
They say Dah.
It's all the same shit.

928
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:29,390
It's like it's all shit that you should 
already know,

929
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,340
like don't be racist,
don't sexually

930
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,800
harass women.
Absolutely don't rape.

931
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,540
Of course,
you know,

932
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,800
don't murder,
Duh.

933
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:38,400
You know,
like,

934
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:40,020
okay,
okay,

935
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,480
well how many times can we talk about 
it?

936
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:42,690
Right?
I get a certain point.

937
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:47,691
I've watched a bunch of their 
conferences online and it's hilarious 

938
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:51,150
because it's so fucking pedantic at the 
end of [inaudible] you get beaten to 

939
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:55,530
death by what they're saying.
It's like you should already know this.

940
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:56,910
Everyone should know this.
This is,

941
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,120
this is silly.
And I think that depends on what 

942
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,120
audience you're speaking to because you 
know,

943
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,450
for anybody was as same id,
sane human being shrewd.

944
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:09,530
I've learned these by the time and our 
five and it's like don and overweight 

945
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,550
that are we still talking about it?
Then of course there are a bunch of 

946
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:12,780
people that are not exactly same id 
saying you won beings.

947
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,330
So maybe for those guys he's a good 
message.

948
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,830
But I agree with you.
It's like to me,

949
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:20,910
my thing is like I use these diamond 
time again in podcasts and writing.

950
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:25,911
I always write the whole idea that rules
are for people who are too stupid to 

951
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:28,710
leave without the rules because you know
if you are smart you don't need them.

952
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,740
But it was because you know how to make 
the right call in every situation and 

953
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,560
you don't need anybody telling you,
look,

954
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:35,640
don't rape anybody.
It's like,

955
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,560
I don't need you to tell me.
I got it.

956
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:39,140
You know,
when you're in the situation,

957
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,470
I need the next thing.
The next.

958
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,550
No,
it's not gonna apply.

959
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:46,551
That's not that.
There's gonna be the exception to that 

960
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:46,830
role either seeing,
they're going to be exceptions,

961
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,350
but steel.
You're going to have the intelligence to

962
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:54,351
be able to make the right call.
He's Ui or somebody was coming to Mug 

963
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:54,351
me.

964
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,100
They made me punching your interface is 
a good idea.

965
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:58,920
You are somebody who is disagreeing with
me punching in the face.

966
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,750
You're crazy.
We a social pet,

967
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:05,810
you know,
you don't need a rule paddle knew when 

968
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:05,810
it's appropriate or not.
You know,

969
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,340
you,
you are able to make the right call that

970
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,010
Ben's.
Yeah,

971
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:13,250
and that's where he's freaking amazing 
that you can carry on a conversation 

972
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,830
with her squirming crawling on you.
This is not working nearly as well as we

973
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,070
were hoping it was going.
So it's a whole thing.

974
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:24,080
She was going to watch the television or
watch their little video or being,

975
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,950
you know,
cheaply.

976
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,670
Apologize.
No worries man.

977
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,380
I honestly thought that.
Yeah.

978
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:33,230
I also had higher hopes than,
uh,

979
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,950
than these.
Then again,

980
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:37,270
she's five painful.
It's,

981
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,430
yeah,
they just,

982
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,540
they are what they are five sometime,
you know,

983
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,820
she surprised me because she'll do 
things that I'm like,

984
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,220
really?

985
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,330
How the hell it,
like I had this conversation with 30 

986
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:50,330
other day where she's telling me,
um,

987
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:55,820
I don't like it,
that I'm so sensitive because every 

988
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:55,820
little thing,
you know,

989
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,670
I feel every scene too much when I'm 
happy,

990
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,400
I'm really happy when I'm sad.
I'm really sad and I'm like,

991
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,610
you have five already were having this 
conversation and then she goes,

992
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,500
even one step forward or she goes,
but you know what?

993
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,160
It's okay because at least when I'm 
happy I'm really super happy.

994
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:12,090
So I'll take the pain of when I'm really
sad thinking,

995
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,770
Jesus,
who are you again?

996
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,030
Let's try this.
So,

997
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:20,031
you know,
I get in those conversational when I'm 

998
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:20,031
like,
wait,

999
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:21,540
you are way bigger than five.
I can take you to do this and that.

1000
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:22,410
And then I realized,
no,

1001
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,410
she's a five-year-old curve that are 
limits to the game.

1002
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,590
But well there's this understanding that
comes with being a human being and 

1003
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:31,750
that's what she's got.

1004
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,450
She's just,
she's a human being with,

1005
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,710
you know,
how am I,

1006
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,640
what is it 100 months on the planet or 
something like that,

1007
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,650
you know,
there's lead me to not even imagine 

1008
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,170
trying to figure the world out with 100 
months of experience and I mean a year 

1009
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,890
of school or whatever.
She's I possible,

1010
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:56,310
but you do have that little human brain 
and then you're also juggling around 

1011
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:00,511
this,
this collection of words that you've 

1012
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,800
acquired and so you're trying to express
these ideas and thoughts and feelings.

1013
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:08,790
One of the themes that are coming out 
with the boat there from the get go is 

1014
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,520
that she not exactly now because she's 
not picking up on the frustration of it 

1015
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,901
all of the discussion,
but normally she has a seen a level of 

1016
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:16,960
empathy.
Not just for a kid,

1017
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,040
but like even for adults.
I see her.

1018
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:24,180
She's always,
whenever she sees somebody was having a 

1019
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:24,180
bad day,
it was really sad.

1020
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,510
She instantly goes to them.
She's trying to,

1021
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:30,511
like,
I've seen her at school where she'll go 

1022
00:48:30,511 --> 00:48:30,511
to a kid was like,
hey,

1023
00:48:30,511 --> 00:48:30,610
he's in bed.
The kid that you don't like.

1024
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:32,290
It was always giving you a hard time and
she's like,

1025
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:37,740
yeah,
but I still feel bad to look at what a 

1026
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,900
bad day these guys and she's going to 
like trying to call him for diamond to 

1027
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:39,900
this scene.
I'm like,

1028
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,390
Jesus,
man,

1029
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,420
you got a really nice nicer to me.
I thought maybe that's what it is.

1030
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,990
Maybe they.
I definitely think kids recognize things

1031
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:53,860
that their parents do that they don't 
think of the right way to handle things.

1032
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,090
Come up with their own sort of work 
arounds.

1033
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,010
It's pretty laborious either in school 
where she was clearly quoting Bob Marley

1034
00:49:01,011 --> 00:49:06,011
liquid.
She was going through a phase where Bob 

1035
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:06,011
Marley was called Marley.
Yeah.

1036
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:08,020
She goes,
I know she loved Bob Marley to death and

1037
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:08,690
she would,
um,

1038
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:14,340
she went to this key to us crying 
because his mom had laughed and was like

1039
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,590
in preschool or something.

1040
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,160
She was four and she started robbing the
kids back as the cutesy.

1041
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,460
And she say,
don't worry about thing.

1042
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,260
I every little thing is going to be all 
that.

1043
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:28,261
I really felt burt's that's a lariat.
She'll ever own the.

1044
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,010
We are seeing some that one day she's 
like,

1045
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:38,011
she asked me shooting the car and she 
asked me for it immediately on time for 

1046
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:38,011
Bob Marley and I'm like,
okay,

1047
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:38,110
no problem.
What Song do you want?

1048
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,270
Like two little birds.
I'm like,

1049
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,820
no baby,
it's three little birds.

1050
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,520
He's like,
no.

1051
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,380
I'm like,
what do you mean it's three?

1052
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,160
No one got shot.
So now there's two little dirt and I'm 

1053
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,160
like,
she's,

1054
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,120
that's morbid that really are going to 
play today.

1055
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,600
But yeah,
my daughter who's four,

1056
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,050
keeps asking me to take her hunting.
Really?

1057
00:49:58,051 --> 00:50:03,051
Yeah.
And I don't know if she's serious or if 

1058
00:50:03,051 --> 00:50:07,171
she misses me when I go away and she 
wants to do like she's never heard a 

1059
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:07,171
gunshot.
You know,

1060
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:11,921
there's,
I mean there's obviously no way she's 

1061
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:12,190
going to be a pullback in Arrow that's 
strong enough to kill an animal.

1062
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:14,440
So it's like that's not gonna happen.
No,

1063
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:19,441
of course.
But step one would probably get used to 

1064
00:50:19,441 --> 00:50:19,720
hearing gunshots.
I don't know.

1065
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,900
She's just so bored.
That held me.

1066
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:24,350
What's mad?

1067
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,460
Tiny

1068
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,930
pinch because you are driving me crazy 
square.

1069
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
He's settle down.
We can't put on a show for you or 

1070
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,390
something like that.
A television show for you to watch.

1071
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,140
Yeah,
baby,

1072
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:43,790
actually,
let's do this serious.

1073
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,940
Sit down and watch your show because 
unfortunately this is being seen by 

1074
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:54,200
thousands and heard by hundreds of 
thousands.

1075
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:00,340
The failing,
that's today's podcast about it at all.

1076
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:02,500
Like I said,
it's,

1077
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:08,570
you know,
that's one thing of becoming a father 

1078
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:08,570
and being around kids.
When I was really young,

1079
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:11,660
like when I was in my early twenties,
I would never be able to deal with it.

1080
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,540
Like little kids.
I'd be like,

1081
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,080
ah,
the guy brought his little kid,

1082
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:17,660
but like when I'm on a plane and like 
little kids crying,

1083
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:21,230
it doesn't bother me at all.
It used to drive me crazy,

1084
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:26,410
but when you have kids,
it's one of those things where you kind 

1085
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:26,410
of recognize.

1086
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,670
One of the things that happened,
the big shift that happened is I started

1087
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:32,840
thinking of everyone as being a baby at 
one point in time.

1088
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,020
Like one point in time,
Kim Jong Il was a baby.

1089
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,900
I know,
right?

1090
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,480
That's fucked up.
You know,

1091
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,900
like Edm.
He was a baby.

1092
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,110
All these weird people in the world,
you know that fucking Pistorius guy that

1093
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:46,790
shot his girlfriend throughout bathroom 
door.

1094
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,080
That guy was a baby.
Yep.

1095
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,320
Okay.
You know all these creeps and fuck ups 

1096
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:53,320
and assholes.
Babies.

1097
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,360
Gloria allred was a baby.
There was a cute little girl.

1098
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,630
Now she's fucking Robin.
People using the law.

1099
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:07,030
Just straight up rob dudes out much do 
you think is how much do you believe in,

1100
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,490
um,
whether it be dna or a soul or something

1101
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:13,790
like something that's purely uniquely 
about that person when they are born and

1102
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:16,190
that's part of our car or our culture.

1103
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,740
You're not a female's nurture versus 
culture debate.

1104
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:23,810
What?
What's your take on what's more 

1105
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:23,810
important in this?
I don't know.

1106
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,060
Well,
they have done studies where they've 

1107
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,491
taken twins that were separated at birth
that were adopted and they get them 

1108
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:33,460
together after not seeing each other 
entire life and they find out they liked

1109
00:52:33,461 --> 00:52:35,270
the same kind of music.
Really?

1110
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:35,620
Yeah.
They,

1111
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,840
they have very similar likes and 
dislikes.

1112
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:43,841
Their personalities are very similar.
There's a strong argument for nature 

1113
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:48,221
over nurture,
but there's no denying that nurture 

1114
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,310
plays a huge role as well.
I don't think it's either or.

1115
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,640
I think we live in a soup of 
possibilities and I think that you can 

1116
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:59,681
get super lucky with the amount of 
exposure that you have to positive and 

1117
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:04,781
even to negative things like there's an 
expression hard times make good people,

1118
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,510
you know,
and I do believe that in a certain sense

1119
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:13,511
that there's some experiences that 
children and adults even have that they 

1120
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:16,010
get through and it makes them more 
empathetic.

1121
00:53:16,011 --> 00:53:21,011
It makes them kinder,
make some more understanding and it 

1122
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:21,011
makes them stronger,
like more,

1123
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:25,430
more character.
Even though it's funny because you're 

1124
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:28,271
right,
I mean there's part of that that's 

1125
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:28,271
totally true

1126
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:31,190
and you do see that happen a lot and 
then you see somebody who through the 

1127
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,990
exact same thing and it makes them 10 
times more of an asshole.

1128
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:37,790
I got hurt so I'm going to hurt anybody 
else in the process and with them and 

1129
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:41,181
he's like that.
That's where you think like what is the 

1130
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:44,091
make these one person make a right turn 
and going in their actual where they 

1131
00:53:44,091 --> 00:53:47,511
become a kinder and nicer because they 
felt what it is to get hurt and what is 

1132
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:50,340
the other one may make the complete 
opposite turn and going in the direction

1133
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:52,780
of I got hurt so I don't care for 
anybody else.

1134
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:54,730
This feeding,
everybody has to pay for defendant.

1135
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,430
I go hurt once.
Yeah,

1136
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,300
it's weird,
right?

1137
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:02,160
It's like there's that moment where you 
can really make a 90 degree turn one way

1138
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:06,510
or another.
What is the make people make the choices

1139
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:06,990
they make?

1140
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,980
It's a very good question and it could 
be a lot of it could be genetics.

1141
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,540
I mean their epigenetics,
that the concept that people are passing

1142
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:19,240
down ideas through their DNA to their 
children is,

1143
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:24,360
is not without merit.
The idea that your ideas that the 

1144
00:54:24,701 --> 00:54:29,701
lessons you've learned in your life are 
not just stored in your brain but are 

1145
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:33,391
stored in every cell in your body and 
also stored in your genetic material 

1146
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:37,831
that passes on to your woman who gives 
birth to the baby and the baby has the 

1147
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,820
genetic material from both the mother 
and the father.

1148
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,580
I mean all of that is is real stuff,
man.

1149
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,640
All absolute real possibilities and it's
really incredibly fascinating.

1150
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:53,050
The idea that we are this soup of 
possibilities.

1151
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,520
We do exist in this very strange world 
of so many different things going on at 

1152
00:54:58,991 --> 00:54:59,710
the same time

1153
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,490
and there is something to.
Yeah,

1154
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:03,530
you're right,
because that's the experience part of it

1155
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:08,531
all where you got some kind of traumatic
experience that really changes your,

1156
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,740
your makeup the way you are as a,
as a person,

1157
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:16,770
as a human being and like.
And at that point to kind.

1158
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,570
I mean I've seen even on myself not I'm 
dealing with right now.

1159
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:23,210
I see how my brain has changed over the 
last 30,

1160
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,400
40 years in some ways,
you know,

1161
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,420
go the way.
In some ways really not in a good way.

1162
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,650
What way is in a bad way.
I think I do have.

1163
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:34,660
I didn't think so,
but now I'm coming to the realization 

1164
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:34,670
that I do have some serious ptsd,
you know,

1165
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:35,600
we're seeing,
you know,

1166
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:38,940
my wife died in my arms,
wasn't quite as a,

1167
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,470
Oh,
I can deal with dates.

1168
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,620
Sure.
Rationally understand us.

1169
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:47,650
She tap ins and nobody's seen goes.
But it did affect me to a different 

1170
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:51,161
level.
So I know I'd have to give you an 

1171
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:52,541
example.
I'll see that because of the way it 

1172
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:52,541
started with there.
He's like,

1173
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:53,170
when she got sick in the first scene,
that was,

1174
00:55:53,171 --> 00:55:54,530
it was like a tiny little thing.
It's like,

1175
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:55,580
oh,
my shoulder hurts.

1176
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:56,600
He's like a big deal,
right?

1177
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:57,320
It's like,
well,

1178
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,360
you went to the gym and you lift it too 
much.

1179
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:03,110
Whatever.
Something seeing that transformed me and

1180
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,150
I met throw for weeks to,
Oh man,

1181
00:56:05,151 --> 00:56:06,740
I can't move my arm anymore.
Oh,

1182
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:11,741
I can barely walk that.
All of that in such a short period of 

1183
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:12,170
time.
Now,

1184
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,360
every time there's something wrong with 
my body,

1185
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,250
I don't just think like,
oh,

1186
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:21,310
look at that weird little scene to them 
that I'm having my mind immediately 

1187
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,730
erased the whole sequence and I'm like,
I'm going to die tomorrow.

1188
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,490
Some horrible,
terrible disease.

1189
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,360
Anything.
I know better.

1190
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,770
Reich noted that stupid.
And I know that that's a fantasy.

1191
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,320
That's like puddle Jack Things,
things that are definitely not lpn and 

1192
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,110
if anything they are damaging and I 
still can't help it.

1193
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,810
They're still part of my brain that even
the conscious of the.

1194
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:44,170
I know it's stupid.
I still go there every single time.

1195
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:47,140
There's something wrong with my body.
And so he's like,

1196
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,480
man,
what do I need to do to change that?

1197
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:51,310
You know,
because he's almost like Pavlov's dogs,

1198
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:56,311
right?
Is Conditional response is immediately 

1199
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:56,311
the second something goes,
they're piled high,

1200
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:57,550
go with it.
And uh,

1201
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:03,050
and you know,
there are moments where I have control 

1202
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:03,050
over it and I can kind of come to this 
place.

1203
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,180
That's because I've seen horrible things
can happen at any moment.

1204
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,130
I actually try and sign and date and I'm
like,

1205
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,410
look,
you have no control over anything,

1206
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:16,411
so let's have fun right here,
right now because what the hell knows 

1207
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:19,171
what happened tomorrow?
That's the empowering part of it and I 

1208
00:57:19,171 --> 00:57:19,730
love it when I get that and I don't love
so much.

1209
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:21,940
And the other one,
which is that terror of,

1210
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,620
Oh shit,
something's gonna happen.

1211
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:29,220
Which you know,
inevitably something's going to happen 

1212
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,220
at some point,
right?

1213
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,220
I mean,
everybody dies,

1214
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,090
everybody gets sick.
That's just the nature of the business.

1215
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:36,100
But having that in the back of your mind
as a some time paralyzing thought,

1216
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,330
that's a whole different game.

1217
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,510
That's part of the problem with being a 
human being,

1218
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:41,430
isn't it?
You're the awareness,

1219
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,760
the awareness of your,
the finite nature of your existence and 

1220
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,690
the fact that it's coming,
whether it's tomorrow or 100 years from 

1221
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:49,690
now,
it's coming.

1222
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:54,410
You know,
if you told someone that they're going 

1223
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:54,410
to die in a thousand years,
I still freak out.

1224
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:57,920
Of course,
every year passes 999

1225
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,020
pithily and I mean that's just the 
noise,

1226
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,000
but there's a somewhat removed,
right?

1227
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,080
There's that intellectual,
existential anxiety and then there's 

1228
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,620
existential anxiety or for sort of like 
people who have seen the weather because

1229
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:16,621
of war or sickness or whatever.
People close to them die in horrible 

1230
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,470
ways.
It's not just an intellectual.

1231
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,790
Some point in the future or something 
bad is going happen is it's in the past,

1232
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:26,791
something bad is gonna happen in any 
second now can app and that's not a fun 

1233
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:26,791
way.

1234
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,990
No,
it's not the best way.

1235
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,190
It's not.
It's not good in any sense of the word.

1236
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,130
Living in the moment and being happy in 
the moment is very.

1237
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,360
It's a.
it's a very difficult thing to do.

1238
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:42,430
It requires.
It requires discipline and it also 

1239
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,230
requires that you develop like a pattern
of thinking.

1240
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,700
Yep,
and you didn't get.

1241
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,010
That's one of the things we were talking
about with the young people,

1242
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:53,011
like they automatically start blaming 
the world and hating on people for 

1243
00:58:53,011 --> 00:58:54,760
whatever has happened wrong to them to 
make people feel the way.

1244
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:59,761
I feel that there's patterns of thinking
that you can fall into like almost 

1245
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:02,620
automatically and once you have that 
pattern,

1246
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,210
it's a cut groove and that groove is 
very easy to slip into.

1247
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,340
It's very comfortable.
It's very simple.

1248
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,810
One of the things that psychedelics do 
is pull you out of that groove.

1249
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:13,580
Exactly.
They,

1250
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,620
they lift you above the motherboard and 
you get to see what the groove is.

1251
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,810
Oh,
this is just a pattern that I've created

1252
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:22,280
and it doesn't.
Not only is not empowering,

1253
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:27,281
it doesn't even make sense.
I'm going to live my life a fucking 

1254
00:59:27,281 --> 00:59:29,120
disaster.
I'm going to 60 more years of this.

1255
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:34,121
Then my heart's going to stop beating 
and I'm going to die an asshole that's 

1256
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,780
very easy to fall into.
It's very easy.

1257
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,120
It can happen to all of us if I go.
Oh,

1258
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:41,540
sorry,
go ahead.

1259
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:46,610
I was just going to say it's very hard 
to reset and even when you do reset,

1260
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:52,271
it's hard to continue that new pattern.
It's like it requires great discipline 

1261
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,460
and sometimes you've got to write things
down.

1262
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:58,040
Writing things down is big right now.
Writing things down,

1263
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,900
reading things,
positive affirmations.

1264
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:05,080
Nobody likes the idea that you go over 
someone's house and they have fucking 

1265
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,470
all these things written on the walls,
like today's a new day today.

1266
01:00:06,471 --> 01:00:08,480
We're going to go forth with strength 
and dignity,

1267
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,800
but doing stuff like that actually can 
benefit you.

1268
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:13,640
It can,
it can.

1269
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:18,641
Writing things on walls and you know,
having positive affirmations can help 

1270
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:18,641
you.

1271
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:19,380
Yeah,
because I mean some stuff,

1272
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:24,410
just because you know,
it doesn't mean that you don't need to 

1273
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:24,870
hear it again and again,
realize it because you know,

1274
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,890
most people know if you have read the 
books,

1275
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,900
if you have been alive long enough,
you probably know what's there is to 

1276
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,650
know you've already before.
The difference is transforming deaf from

1277
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:39,651
intellectual knowledge into actual.
It's part of your being part of 

1278
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:43,640
something that affects how you behave.
Both the old buddy and I'm amber Lyon on

1279
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:48,230
giving me the lecture about psychedelics
moved three times now regarding the,

1280
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,590
this is what you need to now.

1281
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,690
It's a fascinating case,
boys.

1282
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:57,691
She has.
I've never met anybody that I gave the 

1283
01:00:57,691 --> 01:00:59,920
suggestions to like I gave to her where 
they just fucking ran with it.

1284
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:02,140
Like she did that she had changed her 
life.

1285
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,150
Henneberry's it three,
she's a trip.

1286
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,560
I didn't meet her before,
so I don't know what the before looked 

1287
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:09,560
like.
Yeah,

1288
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,870
before she was a very rational,
serious journalist who was very 

1289
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:18,411
concerned about the future of humanity 
and our culture and in journalism 

1290
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,220
because she had seen the ugly side of 
the beast where she had reported on some

1291
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:28,221
horrific events in Bahrain and when she 
got back and try to put together the CNN

1292
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:31,200
piece,
they instead put out this fluff piece,

1293
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:35,010
like almost like a tourism propaganda 
video for Bahrain,

1294
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,470
Bahrain,
depending on how you set.

1295
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Um,
but then when I talked to her about 

1296
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Iowasca,
which by the way,

1297
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:42,880
I've never even done.

1298
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,130
I totally go do Iowaska.
That was the funniest thing of that 

1299
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:47,130
started at time.
Berkeley House.

1300
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:49,870
He's like John Globe about the down it.
And they say,

1301
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,430
you know,
that Joe never did right?

1302
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:51,760
She's like,
yeah,

1303
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:57,100
but I've done dmt a dozen times,
at least.

1304
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,480
Probably nine,
10 or 12,

1305
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,540
something like that.
But this the same thing.

1306
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,120
I mean,
it's,

1307
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,400
it isn't,
but it is.

1308
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,680
I mean,
it's the same psychoactive substance.

1309
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:07,450
In fact,
DMT,

1310
01:02:07,451 --> 01:02:11,860
the small global forum is a stronger 
version of a Iowasca,

1311
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:15,580
but I asked.
It tends to be a long spiritual trip,

1312
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:17,500
which I thought would really benefit 
her.

1313
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,250
You know,
that she was struggling it.

1314
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,700
Right.
And it sure did.

1315
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:21,240
I mean,
again,

1316
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,710
I,
I haven't seen them before.

1317
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:27,711
By the after is insane.
I mean seriously one of those people 

1318
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:28,770
that she glows every time I out with 
her,

1319
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:29,900
I feel happier.
She's,

1320
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,600
she's a drug.
You know what I mean?

1321
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:36,610
Is like in the same room,
improve the level of fat is I'm amazed 

1322
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:37,500
by her every time.
I'm just like,

1323
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,130
are you for real?
I'm like,

1324
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,050
I have never.

1325
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:45,410
I can think of too many people that I've
met that are that happy while she's 

1326
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:49,130
doing psychedelics,
every couple of months I was fucking hit

1327
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:54,140
it so hard from the moment I met her,
like I guess it was like two plus years 

1328
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,501
ago,
more than two years ago because we 

1329
01:02:57,501 --> 01:02:57,501
didn't have the studio.
So from that moment on,

1330
01:02:57,501 --> 01:03:01,940
when she went to the job,
she went to the jungle like a fucking 

1331
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,900
month after I brought her up,
maybe even less went.

1332
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,510
And even though they told her I didn't,
had never done I was,

1333
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,850
she's still fucking,
um,

1334
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:15,530
I think I knew that I told her to do it 
and I knew that it was the thing that 

1335
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:20,571
she needed.
Some people really need that they need 

1336
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:23,691
to go to a place and they need to 
experience this thing in this very alien

1337
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:29,061
form.
And it's so transformative because of 

1338
01:03:29,061 --> 01:03:30,000
the fact that you're in that place,
you know?

1339
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I mean,
I'm sure I could probably benefit from 

1340
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,000
it,
but my,

1341
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,250
what I like to do,
I mean,

1342
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:40,251
my thing,
I have a sensory deprivation tank in my 

1343
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:40,251
basement,
so I'm,

1344
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:43,160
I'm,
I'm sort of experiencing is as removed 

1345
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,821
as the jungle might be.
I'm removing myself from reality itself 

1346
01:03:46,821 --> 01:03:49,260
on this daily basis.
Not to say that I wouldn't still benefit

1347
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:52,200
from it,
but I wouldn't subscribe what I do.

1348
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:52,860
Right.
You know,

1349
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:54,300
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't prescribe rather.

1350
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:57,150
I wouldn't say what you need to do is 
get a tank filled up with water and he'd

1351
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,070
trip your fucking balls out and climbing
that thing.

1352
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:03,800
Like,
I'm not doing that right now.

1353
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:06,300
I have friends that come over.
They don't want to do the tank.

1354
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,610
Like I'm going to get in there.
Why?

1355
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,040
What's so scary about it?
I mean,

1356
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,190
reality is that fucking thing.
Oh,

1357
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:16,250
because the big fucking meat locker of 
reality and I need to do to that have 

1358
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:16,250
done it.

1359
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,100
I mean,
I've always liked.

1360
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,280
I always felt great or no.
Yeah.

1361
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:22,230
Maybe that's my mistake.
Have you been sober?

1362
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,850
Yeah,
I remember the first time.

1363
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:26,970
It was good to do it sober,
you know,

1364
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,040
amateur,
right?

1365
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,430
Gotcha.
Sure.

1366
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,680
Float tank,
uh,

1367
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:35,750
with an asterisk.
The asterisk is very important because 

1368
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,160
whatever the asked Rick can do the astro
can do in regular life.

1369
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:43,340
It's multiplied 10 fold inside of there 
because especially edibles,

1370
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:49,050
edible marijuana becomes a full blown 
psychedelic experiments and the that he 

1371
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,780
bolts for somebody who is like 11 
hydroxy metabolite.

1372
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:54,060
That's what it is.
Maybe that's the [inaudible] I've tried.

1373
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:59,090
Every time I've tried edibles is either 
too little where I don't feel it or I 

1374
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,080
feel like somebody grabbing the biggest 
basketball back in,

1375
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:01,860
but your way first and just slagged me 
off.

1376
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,820
Not Pleasurable.
Just like,

1377
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:08,100
oh my God,
where am I?

1378
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,430
What the hell?
Those are my favorite trips really does.

1379
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:16,470
We'll do.
I don't think them whether it happened 

1380
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,470
when they were over,
I learned the most from them.

1381
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:17,980
Like I like being scared that because I 
know

1382
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,270
I'm going to be okay,
but I don't know.

1383
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:20,470
I'm going to be okay.
Why it's happening.

1384
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,610
I think I got when I was maybe 15 or 16,
something like that.

1385
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:31,630
I did this.
I remember making these tea with ashish 

1386
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:35,790
and the.
We got a little carried away because 

1387
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,531
they were supposed to be a bunch of 
people doing that and it turned out to 

1388
01:05:37,531 --> 01:05:40,321
be only two or five years.
So the doors that were supposed to be 

1389
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:42,901
for like,
I think he was like half a gram per 

1390
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:42,910
person and the study was two and a half 
a gram per person.

1391
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,920
That's a lot.
So by the time we'd down it's,

1392
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,930
you know,
an hour goes by with teddy bowls is also

1393
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:48,370
messy because you don't feel it right 
away.

1394
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,380
So an hour goes by and you're like,
Eh,

1395
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:52,230
nothing happening.
Two hours goes by.

1396
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:52,870
I'm like,
really?

1397
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,370
Nothing steal.
What a waste.

1398
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,860
We throw that stuff away.
I go to sleep,

1399
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,650
I wake up two hours later and I'm just 
like,

1400
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,750
am I?
Where am I?

1401
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,870
And I pass out and I opened up my eyes 
again and like,

1402
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:06,710
where am I?
And I,

1403
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:11,340
and the next six hours go like these 
where I basically lose consciousness 70,

1404
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,900
30 seconds and I wake up,
where am I?

1405
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:16,960
Or Am I think after that I was like,
yeah,

1406
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:21,961
I don't think I'm doing too badly.
It even other times that I've done it 

1407
01:06:21,961 --> 01:06:22,690
was always not quite that bad,
but clothes.

1408
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,740
And I'm like,
yeah,

1409
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:26,620
I don't think it bolts are,
are men for me.

1410
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:27,550
Well,
there's,

1411
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:32,320
there's so many religions that have 
cannabis and cannabis eating as the base

1412
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,910
of their religion.
Hindu is,

1413
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,500
um,
there's so many,

1414
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:37,480
uh,
so many passages in,

1415
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:39,010
in ancient Hindu scripts.

1416
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:41,260
And I'm like,
if you look up,

1417
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,780
if you look up on,
on,

1418
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:45,490
uh,
on Wikipedia,

1419
01:06:45,491 --> 01:06:50,491
you can look up the f entheogenic use of
cannabis and shows all these different 

1420
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,150
times where people have used cannabis as
a psychedelic,

1421
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:56,290
like not just,
Oh,

1422
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,480
we're smoking a joint relaxed,
but when you eat it,

1423
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:02,020
you have these profound visions,
but you eat enough.

1424
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:07,021
Like Mckenna used to say that eating 
like large doses of marijuana was 

1425
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:08,650
equivalent to eating large doses of 
mushrooms.

1426
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,680
It's just a matter of having the courage
to eat too much code.

1427
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,810
You'll never get the crazy heart fast 
heart rate on a,

1428
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,960
on edibles.
You can.

1429
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:25,140
Yeah.
Because then you don't get a fast heart 

1430
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,301
rate,
but you get this panic sense like I'm 

1431
01:07:27,301 --> 01:07:27,301
never going to sober up.
Oh,

1432
01:07:27,301 --> 01:07:31,680
but not as a physical thing.
A physical thing like I've done like a 

1433
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:31,780
heart.

1434
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:36,810
Yeah.
Where I feel my heart start pounding 

1435
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:36,810
where I'm just like,
Jesus,

1436
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:40,621
I'm going like 120 beats per minute with
our son seeing which are not doing 

1437
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:41,800
exercise.
That's a bit much.

1438
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:46,860
I bet it's anxiety.
That probably as probably is because it 

1439
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,650
brings on a lot of anxiety.
Oh yeah.

1440
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,910
Heavy duty edibles make you really 
reconsider it.

1441
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:56,090
It's,
it's very difficult to live in the 

1442
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:58,891
moment on heavy duty edibles because it 
forces you to examine problematic 

1443
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:03,031
aspects of your past behavior,
assuming you'll still have an affluent 

1444
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:04,210
cdt because there are really tight.
So I'm just like,

1445
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:06,650
I'm not accepting,
not accepting a belief.

1446
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:07,630
I don't know.
Well,

1447
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,340
yeah.
Oh yeah.

1448
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:14,341
You can go too deep.
Not too long ago with the Rick Simpson 

1449
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:14,910
oil.
Oh yeah.

1450
01:08:14,911 --> 01:08:19,911
Yeah.
Which supposed to be great for health 

1451
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:22,511
and then you know,
the thing with the oil is that unless 

1452
01:08:22,511 --> 01:08:23,690
somebody preparing it for you in 
capsules or something,

1453
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:28,750
it's such a guesswork of trying to 
figure out which one is how many drops 

1454
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:28,880
you not put up.

1455
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:34,290
Yeah.
So I've done it where I take a tiny bit 

1456
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:34,290
and I feel nothing and I'm assuming it's
Ilt,

1457
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:38,530
but whatever.
I'm not feeling anything and I take a 

1458
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:38,530
tiny bit and one day I take a tiny beat 
plus a,

1459
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:42,851
my new school,
tiny micro drop more and I'm like 

1460
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:42,980
hitting the trees.
Right.

1461
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:45,590
I'm just way out there and I'm like,
whoa.

1462
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:50,740
What's also,
who's making those things know being 

1463
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,710
made in the same place where they make 
Tesla's?

1464
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:58,110
Yeah,
that's part of the problem when that's 

1465
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,360
why we did sell feudal.
Well,

1466
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:03,380
it's the plan.
You can kind of figure things out and 

1467
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,600
when you're smoking it you can sort of 
feel how it's going and you can stop.

1468
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:10,950
It's edible,
sees you take it and an hour later 

1469
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:11,450
you're in Florida.
Surprise to see what it's like.

1470
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:16,510
I was listening to this radio show the 
other day where people are complaining 

1471
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:17,180
about marijuana being stronger than it 
was when they were kids.

1472
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:22,181
Like this guy in his fifties who just 
recently tried marijuana again and he 

1473
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:25,931
was talking about how he overdosed.
I overdosed on marijuana and I swear to 

1474
01:09:25,931 --> 01:09:26,760
God,
how do you exactly.

1475
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:29,690
You almost went to the hospital.
I mean I barely got through it.

1476
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:34,691
I mean you can overdose.
I mean it was like going on like about 

1477
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:34,691
the pot today,
right?

1478
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:36,650
It's dangerous.
Like shut the fuck up.

1479
01:09:36,651 --> 01:09:41,651
What do you like?
The fact that someone can go on the air 

1480
01:09:41,651 --> 01:09:41,651
and say something like that,
that's bullshit.

1481
01:09:41,651 --> 01:09:46,511
It's what's it's.
It's not just like you could put a bad 

1482
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:51,351
thought in someone's head and I really 
believe that they could die from it 

1483
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:52,850
unless they have a computer people.
I'm talking from zero,

1484
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,580
zero

1485
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,300
ever.
No,

1486
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:58,580
never.
I'm going to be the first one.

1487
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,920
The first one to die.
I'm going to fuck it all up for 

1488
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,960
everybody else.
I want to be the first one to die.

1489
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:11,290
Right?
There was a guy who died in Colorado 

1490
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,751
because he jumped off a roof and they 
were trying to get rid of edibles 

1491
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:13,751
because in one fucking dipshit jumped 
off a roof.

1492
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:19,350
The thing is,
every single substance that's out there 

1493
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:21,310
is even the mosque held water.
If you drink too much water,

1494
01:10:21,311 --> 01:10:22,570
you can die from it.
Right?

1495
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:24,200
I mean,
he's like every single

1496
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,940
using gay too.
What's the con?

1497
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:28,710
Every tool.
Cars,

1498
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,060
everything,
skateboards.

1499
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,130
Everything is how you lose it.
I mean if we,

1500
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,570
if we based what kills you,
you know what's illegal?

1501
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,750
We would literally make everything 
illegal.

1502
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,200
Yeah.
It'll be number one.

1503
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:46,010
People have died from using computer,
computers are blown up on people and 

1504
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,010
they've died.
Right?

1505
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:49,170
Cell phones have blown up in people's 
pockets and they've been gravely injured

1506
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,450
or died from a cell phone.

1507
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,750
Let's find out.
Let's sound good.

1508
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,380
Anyways,
killed by cell phones.

1509
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,050
I'm going to say yes.
I'm going to say killed by cell phone.

1510
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:01,970
While you're finding out about the cell 
phone,

1511
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:03,640
let me take care of them.
Tiny monkey.

1512
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,290
Okay.
Okay.

1513
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:07,080
Okay.

1514
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:13,980
Don't answer the call while charging.
Urban legends man takes woman's cell 

1515
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,980
phone after she's killed by train.
Wow,

1516
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,770
that's dark man.
Killed by cell phone explosion.

1517
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,240
Okay.
Let's see.

1518
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:24,150
Gizmodo man killed by cell phone 
explosion.

1519
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:29,151
A Korean man was apparently killed by 
his LG cell phone today and this was a,

1520
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,110
by the way,
in 2007,

1521
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:37,010
they probably got old shit back then.
He was carrying the phone in his shirt 

1522
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:39,210
pocket when it exploded,
puncturing his heart and lungs.

1523
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:44,420
It happened in North Chung Cheong 
Province of Korea.

1524
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,000
As the man was working on a construction
site,

1525
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,400
he was found dead by one of his 
coworkers.

1526
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,520
Whoa.
Do you think his parents or his family 

1527
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:55,520
got some money?
Wendy's.

1528
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,830
This was North Korea now South Korea.
Korea says a Korean man.

1529
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,940
North Chung Chung.
It's just just as Korea.

1530
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:08,030
It doesn't say North or South Korea.
I'm assuming it's South Korea because 

1531
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,030
North Korea,
I think there are about 250 to six years

1532
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,440
away from seeing cell phones.

1533
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:14,520
Yeah,
this is.

1534
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:15,300
Yeah,
no kidding.

1535
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:16,560
Right.
Poor bastards.

1536
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:21,890
That's why the one of the craziest 
things about 2014 that we still have a 

1537
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:23,460
real live communist dictator running and
entire country.

1538
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:24,750
That's terrified.
Yep.

1539
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:25,910
Yep.
I this little goofy,

1540
01:12:25,911 --> 01:12:30,911
Chubby moon face motherfucker.
Who's the son of another goofy Chelsie 

1541
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:34,000
moon face motherfucker.
It's like that just.

1542
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,230
Yeah.
Or the Isis Guy.

1543
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:38,420
I mean sinks that really belong to the 
Middle Ages.

1544
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,660
Then you're like really dwindled shit.
Come on.

1545
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,640
This is where.
And on one end,

1546
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:48,641
you know,
you see humanity and we are so damn 

1547
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:48,641
advanced and we are doing these amazing 
things.

1548
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:53,410
And on the other end where dwayne steel,
the same sheets that were Dwayne 2000 

1549
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,040
years ago,
those isis guys are.

1550
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:59,080
They release videos on youtube to 
graphic horrific videos on youtube and 

1551
01:12:59,080 --> 01:12:59,960
then they don't get pulled.
Yeah.

1552
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:02,890
Until like weeks later he find out about
them like,

1553
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,630
I don't know how like a video gets 
pulled from youtube.

1554
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,900
I mean someone has to flag it I guess.
Yeah.

1555
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,220
And like maybe they're only sending it 
to the people that they know or,

1556
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:17,221
or whatever and they'll survive a while 
before but somebody put something up 

1557
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:21,581
like check this shit out.
And I went and clicked on a link and I 

1558
01:13:21,581 --> 01:13:21,581
was like,
Jesus,

1559
01:13:21,581 --> 01:13:23,450
this is on Youtube.
I know these guys shooting each other,

1560
01:13:23,451 --> 01:13:28,451
these shooting these guys while they 
were on the ground and then cutting 

1561
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:28,451
their heads off like all very,
very graphic.

1562
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:29,870
And I was like,
I can't believe this is on Youtube.

1563
01:13:29,871 --> 01:13:34,871
There's stuff out there that makes you.
I've seen the most disturbing things 

1564
01:13:34,871 --> 01:13:38,861
I've ever seen was this one thing he 
like somewhere in Africa or somebody 

1565
01:13:38,861 --> 01:13:41,270
suspected of being anxious and so they 
get of these people and set them on fire

1566
01:13:41,271 --> 01:13:43,580
and you know,
after awhile I was like,

1567
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:48,581
you know,
why the hell am I watching this done 

1568
01:13:48,581 --> 01:13:48,581
over?

1569
01:13:48,581 --> 01:13:50,300
I know that Ben,
so I don't need to see it in it's nuts.

1570
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:55,380
It's like straight out of the 39 minutes
or something in 2014 is all the progress

1571
01:13:57,681 --> 01:14:02,681
that we've gone through to get to this 
point in age and there's still some 

1572
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:02,681
people that just.
You could take them,

1573
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,780
you could shove them back to the year 
zero and they would fit called.

1574
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:08,770
Yes.
Yeah,

1575
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:09,560
it's both.
It's.

1576
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,860
There's that thing going on.
Human beings,

1577
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:13,090
man,
that spectrum.

1578
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:18,340
The broad spectrum of behavior where it 
almost seems like you have to have like 

1579
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,790
shitty people to appreciate the good 
people.

1580
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:27,180
Like I wonder if there's ever going to 
come a time where there's a legitimate 

1581
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:31,021
biological utopia where like human 
beings like where they achieve some form

1582
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:35,920
of enlightenment where everyone has 
reached the dust age.

1583
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:39,940
We're talking about like his atheism,
plus they rattle this onto themselves,

1584
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:45,210
but they should know better.
They're all fucking educated and going 

1585
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:45,830
to conferences and stuff like that.
They see.

1586
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,310
It's like they're preaching to the choir
essentially or,

1587
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:53,340
or propping themselves up on a nice 
moral high ground in front of their 

1588
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:58,381
peers.
But there's gonna come a time where the 

1589
01:14:58,381 --> 01:14:58,381
whole world is like that.
Is that possible?

1590
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:03,650
That would be an an I get what you're 
saying about you need the bad people to 

1591
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:03,650
their shade.
The good people.

1592
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:09,710
There's a general improvement of 
humanity going into more pleasant 

1593
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:12,980
direction.
We don't need the bad people just give 

1594
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:12,980
us a dvds,
a showing

1595
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,190
this is what the bad people experiences 
like.

1596
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,640
Whoa.
Really?

1597
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,420
And you know,
make people very nice.

1598
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,370
So you watch movies and you get almost 
like an experience

1599
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,040
without diving actually to deal with it 
because the whole restaurant,

1600
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:27,900
now that you've been here,
a religious devout are.

1601
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:30,970
You need to evolve in order to 
appreciate the good.

1602
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,530
Like to what degree man,
because we talk about human history,

1603
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,290
there has been so much evil that is like
really?

1604
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:41,650
I could actually do with one,
100 of that.

1605
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:46,651
I will learn the lesson.
I don't need to learn that same lesson 

1606
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:46,960
over and over again in such brutal nasty
fashion.

1607
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:52,650
There's something about the design of 
human history or nature or for that 

1608
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:53,320
matter,
because as you say multiple times.

1609
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:54,470
I mean,
when you look at nature,

1610
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:57,310
it's like it's not a soft,
fuzzy,

1611
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,810
happy animals running around the forest.
He's brutal.

1612
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,410
His fangs and close on the whole thing 
and it's like,

1613
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:08,580
yeah,
maybe if it's about appreciating the 

1614
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:08,580
good stuff,
there would be a gentler way to go about

1615
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,460
it.
Do we really have to go these hardcore?

1616
01:16:10,461 --> 01:16:11,260
It will make it happen.

1617
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:15,250
Yeah.
Nature is the most vicious motherfucker.

1618
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:20,251
A wall my friend was telling me about,
I'm watching this bear killed this 

1619
01:16:21,961 --> 01:16:24,780
female bear.
He was watching his grizzly bears.

1620
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:30,200
They were observing them and this male 
was trying to mate with this female 

1621
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,610
grizzly bear and the grizzly bear.
I didn't want to mate with them.

1622
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:34,290
She kept pushing them off and yelling at
him.

1623
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:38,070
I kept trying so hard to get her to meet
with them,

1624
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,550
but she didn't want to do it and then a 
new grizzly bear,

1625
01:16:41,551 --> 01:16:45,420
a new female came into the picture and 
the new female came into the picture and

1626
01:16:45,421 --> 01:16:50,421
started trying to get him to meet with 
her and he got angry that she was 

1627
01:16:50,421 --> 01:16:53,350
distracting him so he murdered her in 
front of the other business.

1628
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:58,640
Just tore her apart,
that just ripped her to shreds and he 

1629
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,841
said it was the craziest thing because 
all of a sudden this bear had its feet 

1630
01:17:02,841 --> 01:17:03,870
up in the air and it was just dead like 
within seconds,

1631
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:06,720
like a few seconds ago,
it had wandered into the camp,

1632
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:11,900
you know,
or into this little valley with these 

1633
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:12,490
were and tried to get this bear to me 
and he,

1634
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:17,890
he's a biologist and so he was observing
this stuff or if he's not a biologist 

1635
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:22,361
who works with biologists and it was 
observing this stuff and he said it was 

1636
01:17:22,361 --> 01:17:22,910
one of the most disturbing things he's 
ever seen in his life.

1637
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:27,940
He's a hunter.
He's lived his whole life hunting and 

1638
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:27,940
you know,
death is a normal,

1639
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:31,961
natural part of life to him.
But this to him freaked him out more 

1640
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:36,311
than anything I'd ever seen because he 
said it was so brutal and it was so 

1641
01:17:36,311 --> 01:17:36,311
instantaneous,

1642
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,750
you know,
it's just really crazy,

1643
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:43,751
man.
Do you ever do divert daily about the 

1644
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:43,751
rapists,
necrophilia docs,

1645
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:47,830
docs?
I didn't tell you about the rapists 

1646
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:47,830
necrophilia docs thing.
So I have to.

1647
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:48,240
So,
you know,

1648
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,780
cute little dogs,
they are adorable.

1649
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:54,200
I remember seeing docs beam bar naturing
out with an ag and I'm like,

1650
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:57,910
I never eat in Nag again.
Diane 18 doc again and poorly told that,

1651
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:03,060
you know,
you got into these romanticized cute 

1652
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:03,060
fuzzy thing.
Right?

1653
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:07,720
And then I start reading about docs that
apparently mailed docs are particularly 

1654
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:12,950
fond of raping female dogs and um,
but this is where it gets interesting.

1655
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:14,840
So they go out,
I'm sure maybe you've seen them in these

1656
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:19,870
super high speed chase where the female 
is that I need and there's like two or 

1657
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,440
three male run flying right behind her 
and in,

1658
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:26,441
during this high speed chases,
occasionally the female take the wrong 

1659
01:18:26,441 --> 01:18:28,730
turn and she ask us into something a 
three or a weekend or something.

1660
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:30,180
And then she,
uh,

1661
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:33,350
she broke her neck and die immediately.
But you know,

1662
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,490
bodies still warm.
So the one that'd be rapists,

1663
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:38,870
docs on poor suites,
the side,

1664
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:39,800
ah,
what the hell,

1665
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:41,750
we don't want to waste this.
So.

1666
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:46,160
And they just got on and have sex with a
dead corpse after that.

1667
01:18:46,161 --> 01:18:48,350
I'm like,
docs are back on the manual

1668
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,360
motherfuckers because you guys are mean 
and horrible and I'm going to each 

1669
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,060
again,
maybe this is show to all those people 

1670
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,060
that are trying to keep you from eating 
fog war,

1671
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,360
right.
You know,

1672
01:18:57,361 --> 01:18:59,370
that's a weird thing that California 
has.

1673
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,850
California has a law where you're not 
allowed to eat duck liver,

1674
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:07,910
but you can eat ducks because they were 
forced feeding these ducks if their 

1675
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,090
liver to grow and people found out to be
unbelievably cruel,

1676
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:13,980
I guess crueler than killing them.
Right.

1677
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:19,130
And eating them like force feeding them 
to get their livers to grow larger was 

1678
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,930
crueler than killing them.
Emi.

1679
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:22,590
Okay.

1680
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,630
I mean the,
you know,

1681
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:27,680
the stuff that's done in raising 
anymore,

1682
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,490
letting industrial level tend to be 
pretty fucked up,

1683
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:35,550
which is why even people who whine about
that but they do anything related to 

1684
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:39,601
whether you have land that already with 
any kind of meat is ridiculous because 

1685
01:19:39,601 --> 01:19:39,700
it's like hunting is a lot cleaner.
That way.

1686
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,880
You know,
you'll let the animal live its life be 

1687
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:44,880
for the end of every single commercial 
farming.

1688
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,591
Yet,
there's some nasty stuff happening at 

1689
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:49,591
the same time,
you know,

1690
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:50,670
there are limits to how far you want to 
take it because there's.

1691
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,410
They're not too many simple,
clean,

1692
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:58,440
painless,
easy ways to do seeing that still 

1693
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:58,440
deliver the goods that people that rely 
on.

1694
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,791
So it's a very.
That's why he's the same thing as the 

1695
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:05,101
stuff we were saying earlier.
Any kind of dogmatic position about 

1696
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:07,861
these either the scuttle animals,
they're just here for us to use an Okr 

1697
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:08,040
sweater and

1698
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,100
a software horribly or the poor little 
band.

1699
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:12,510
Nice.
You can touch anything.

1700
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,850
I've missed the boat.
Three colors,

1701
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,880
right?
They both have a point that they are 

1702
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:19,880
both ridiculous.
If taken too far.

1703
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:23,330
Have you ever seen the video of a woman?
She walks into a restaurant and tells 

1704
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:26,610
everyone in the restaurant that what 
they're eating is not food.

1705
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:27,870
It's violence.
No,

1706
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,250
and she.
She goes in,

1707
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:31,200
she tells everybody about her little 
girl.

1708
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,720
I want to tell you about my little girl 
and it's chicken.

1709
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:36,000
She's talking about.
Her name is snow.

1710
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,530
Have you seen it?
We've seen it.

1711
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:41,160
Jamie,
let me find it for you.

1712
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:43,380
We should play it because it's just so 
ridiculous.

1713
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:49,080
No,
that's not food.

1714
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:54,140
It's violence.
Are you done kid?

1715
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,370
We can.
We can.

1716
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,400
We can.
We can end this and next time you come 

1717
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,410
by I'll bring my daughter the otters and
we'll have a little party.

1718
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:08,400
They complain and rant goes viral.
This isn't food.

1719
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:13,401
It's violence.
Pull this up and we'll have you seen 

1720
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:19,251
with bill cosby did yesterday.
There was just that right before we 

1721
01:21:19,251 --> 01:21:19,300
started.
Lord,

1722
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,870
if you don't know what's going on about 
bill cosby,

1723
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:26,640
Bill cosby going to be very careful how 
I phrase this.

1724
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:32,240
Allegedly has raped a large number of 
women and allegedly has drug these women

1725
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:39,530
and I mean I find it hard to believe 
that 13 women would make something 

1726
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:44,240
that's a large number.
I mean it would have to be some massive 

1727
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,270
conspiracy dating back to the 19 
seventies just now being uncovered.

1728
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:48,180
So he put this thing on his website 
yesterday,

1729
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:49,650
like me.

1730
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:54,860
Go ahead and meme me with a photo of him
and the meme being the print that you 

1731
01:21:55,201 --> 01:22:00,201
can add a meme generator and his said,
happy Monday and these people just went 

1732
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:04,040
crazy.
I mean it,

1733
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,900
it went,
it got so ugly,

1734
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,530
like,
I mean one of them was like,

1735
01:22:10,531 --> 01:22:13,830
one of the first one was like more than 
a dozen women have accused me of rape.

1736
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,940
How can I hear you say no because he's 
got like headphones on.

1737
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,100
What do you mean you're pressing 
charges?

1738
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,090
I mean it's,
it's,

1739
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,390
these are the mild ones,
but I mean,

1740
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:27,090
what was he thinking?
He's a fucking idiot.

1741
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:32,120
What the hell was he thinking for?
A lot of people believe that someone who

1742
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:34,240
works for him did it on purpose.
Really.

1743
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:39,710
Someone who works for him knew that it 
was going to like someone who is like a 

1744
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,850
website designer.
We've got to think like website 

1745
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:43,850
designers.

1746
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,570
A lot of times younger people and maybe 
even a woman.

1747
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:46,100
Right?
You know,

1748
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,930
it was like this fucking piece of shit.
I can't believe I'm working for him.

1749
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,600
Or a guy who is sympathetic to what's 
going on and says,

1750
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:56,601
look,
how do I get this fucker that would 

1751
01:22:56,601 --> 01:22:56,601
actually be ged?
That's what happened.

1752
01:22:56,601 --> 01:23:01,100
That's great.
I mean they put a bunch of them that 

1753
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,820
were like really cute.
His on his website,

1754
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:07,850
like they,
they took some of the ones that people 

1755
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,231
had created that were pg rated,
but the amount that were raped related 

1756
01:23:10,231 --> 01:23:11,800
was so staggering.
Well,

1757
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:12,560
of course.
I mean,

1758
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:16,180
what's he like in the news?
What's has been like,

1759
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:21,210
what have you heard about him in the 
news over the last year has been the 

1760
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:21,210
story,
right?

1761
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:21,370
So it's like,
of course that's what's going to pop up.

1762
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:25,570
Of course that's what's going to happen 
and no one is a press charges is okay.

1763
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,330
I wonder how you could.
Because it's.

1764
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:30,250
It seems strange,
you know,

1765
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:35,800
it seems like if you don't have the 
physical evidence like,

1766
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:38,470
but you have 13 people telling a similar
story.

1767
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:43,890
I wonder how that works.
The pencils are from how long ago it is 

1768
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:44,410
because that's all statue of 
limitations.

1769
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:46,000
Is there a statute of limitations on 
rape?

1770
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:50,680
I'm as it and I think it is.
I think it is.

1771
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,980
I think there is,
isn't that would save that 77 guy.

1772
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,540
That's exactly what it is.
Right?

1773
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:58,160
This is a statute of limitations is 
wiser.

1774
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,340
Central limitations on something so 
horrible.

1775
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:05,670
Know.
It becomes tricky though because of 

1776
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:08,011
course once you wait to report it,
it's all physical evidence is gone and 

1777
01:24:08,011 --> 01:24:10,750
Danny,
you have to rely on a lot the newer kind

1778
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:13,120
of evidence that's a lot harder to make 
the case.

1779
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:18,490
There is also that.
The thing about memory right discussed 

1780
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:22,141
earlier that human memory is one of the 
worst pieces of evidence you could ever 

1781
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:22,141
get.

1782
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:25,330
There are people that I have had 
experiences with where they'll go,

1783
01:24:25,331 --> 01:24:30,331
hey,
remember when we did this and did that 

1784
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:30,331
and blah blah,
blah.

1785
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,300
I'm like,
we never even been in there with,

1786
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:33,310
you know,
you went with us like,

1787
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,350
listen man,
I've never been to South Dakota.

1788
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,360
Stop.
It didn't happen.

1789
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:39,170
Or they remember the wrong state or 
there.

1790
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,380
I mean,
people's memories are fucking terrible.

1791
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:46,620
They're awful.
Do you have this video will play this 

1792
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:46,620
and then we'll give her a chance.
Slicker.

1793
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:47,100
She looks,
she's done.

1794
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,730
We did like an hour and a half.
That's all good.

1795
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,560
Like you got to see this.
Watch this video.

1796
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:52,240
Please put your headphones on so you can
hear this stuff,

1797
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:55,210
but it's not plugged in anymore.
So you of course,

1798
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,250
hold on a second,
give it a chance.

1799
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,100
Did she yank it out?
Of course.

1800
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,320
It's like,
okay,

1801
01:25:02,321 --> 01:25:04,020
we'll just play this and then we'll end 
it.

1802
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:09,360
This is so ridiculous.
This woman walks in this restaurant and 

1803
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,540
there there's a whole group of people 
behind her.

1804
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,620
She walked into a restaurant and people 
are eating little girl.

1805
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:22,690
She was very abused for her entire life.
She was terrified.

1806
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,990
She has a very determined look in her 
eyes wherever she goes,

1807
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:31,790
and she was hurt and abused her entire 
life because of this establishment and 

1808
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:36,460
because of establishment,
she was locked away.

1809
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:40,180
She was hidden.
She got nobody there for her.

1810
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:45,930
She was crying.
She was scared every single moment and 

1811
01:25:46,301 --> 01:25:49,720
because they're useful as had run out,
she was going to be killed.

1812
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:55,240
Someone to blame and I can.
I can see you laughing.

1813
01:25:55,580 --> 01:26:00,310
It's not funny.
I went in there with other humans.

1814
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:04,610
I took her out of there.
She wouldn't be with me right now.

1815
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:10,090
She wouldn't be gone just like,
all right everybody today.

1816
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:20,250
There was other girls,
but they just wanted to live their life 

1817
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:31,730
and their bodies and every time you see 
someone eating somebody else's ags or 

1818
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:44,690
somebody else's body,
you are going to remember her name.

1819
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:50,500
Her name is a beautiful little girl and 
it didn't just violent is the best part.

1820
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:57,880
They all come in and they all have a

1821
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:01,380
sign like it's not just to say it.
They have to have assigned it.

1822
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:01,620
Hold on.

1823
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,810
I think of her name every time,

1824
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:15,460
like these fucking pathetic people that 
are just so lucky.

1825
01:27:15,461 --> 01:27:20,461
Their ancestors ate meat to get them to 
2014 idealistic little kids in this 

1826
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:25,680
video that you have the in the 
background.

1827
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:29,810
Say,
my girl is all perfect,

1828
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:35,210
but it's crazy.
She has this determined look in her 

1829
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:35,210
eyes.
She goes,

1830
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:35,210
no,
she doesn't.

1831
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:35,690
Okay.
Her expression never changed.

1832
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:39,490
She's a fucking chicken.
God dammit and crazy lady.

1833
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:44,270
That is one of my favorite videos ever 
because she's just so bonkers.

1834
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:46,540
Like I see you smiling.
Gee,

1835
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:49,120
I wonder why we're smiling.
Maybe because you're kind of crazy.

1836
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:53,320
You're walking into a chicken restaurant
with more people and Jamie's right.

1837
01:27:53,321 --> 01:27:55,880
There's more people came with her that 
were in the restaurant.

1838
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,820
What's the at like two in the afternoon 
and some flower.

1839
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,140
It was just so strange.

1840
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:07,860
She's a little girl,
just turban looking her wherever she 

1841
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,250
goes and she just went to live and 
people are eating her eggs.

1842
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:14,470
I guess what?
I eat my chicken's eggs and they don't 

1843
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:14,470
care at all.
You know why?

1844
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:14,760
Because the eggs don't become a chicken.
You fucking dunce.

1845
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,450
Yeah.
He just eggs.

1846
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,550
When you have chickens,
you can have chickens as pets.

1847
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:21,010
They provide you with free protein,
right?

1848
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,600
You give them food and they give you 
protein.

1849
01:28:23,601 --> 01:28:25,550
That doesn't hurt anybody.
It doesn't harm them.

1850
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:27,380
They have chickens.
They lay eggs every day.

1851
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:29,810
Right.
This idea that you're their milk.

1852
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:30,590
No,
no,

1853
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:31,530
no.
There's no chicken meal.

1854
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:37,610
Never seem to stay away from me.
They don't breastfeed,

1855
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:40,820
but this,
you know,

1856
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:43,160
that is the spectrum.
That's the spectrum.

1857
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:48,161
I mean,
sensitivity is important and 

1858
01:28:48,161 --> 01:28:48,350
understanding of nature's important.
I mean I've been accused,

1859
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:53,351
especially lately since I've last couple
of years since I started hunting of 

1860
01:28:53,351 --> 01:28:55,820
being cruel of doing it because you 
enjoy killing animals.

1861
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,680
I don't at all,
I mean I,

1862
01:28:57,681 --> 01:29:00,650
I enjoy hunting,
I enjoy bringing home the meat.

1863
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:05,370
I actually,
I think that the killing of the animals,

1864
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:06,770
the worst part of it,
the,

1865
01:29:06,771 --> 01:29:11,771
the,
the fact that you're able to take an 

1866
01:29:11,771 --> 01:29:13,590
animal out of nature though,
like in the most natural environment,

1867
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:18,591
possibly if I didn't exist,
that animal would be doing the exact 

1868
01:29:18,591 --> 01:29:19,860
same thing until I came along.
There was no influence whatsoever on its

1869
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:21,990
life and then all sudden boom,
it ends,

1870
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,250
which is going to end by wolves.
It's going to end by,

1871
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:28,080
especially where I was,
I was up in Canada where they have,

1872
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:33,470
they have so many wolves up there.
They have no limit on how many wolves 

1873
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:34,700
you can shoot serious that had begun to 
wealth football,

1874
01:29:34,701 --> 01:29:36,960
a huge population problem.
Huge.

1875
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,050
Like they have elk,
they have deer,

1876
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:43,620
they have moose and the wolves are just 
killing them left and right.

1877
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,110
While we were up there and we actually 
came upon,

1878
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:51,000
we saw all these ravens that were 
floating around this one area,

1879
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:54,000
so we're trying to figure out what it 
was that they were attracted to.

1880
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:59,150
So we went over to it and we found this 
moose calf that had been torn apart by 

1881
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:03,030
wolves.
This is the Moose calf.

1882
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:08,060
I'll put it up on my instagram later so 
you guys could see because you're not 

1883
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:08,750
going much left.
But this,

1884
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,140
oh,
it's just mangled.

1885
01:30:10,141 --> 01:30:13,050
It was crazy and it was wolves,
wolves,

1886
01:30:13,051 --> 01:30:14,670
it taking it from,
from its mother.

1887
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:18,510
And they just figured out a way to get 
ahold of it and just ripped apart.

1888
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,920
Cars,
devoured it,

1889
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:22,010
and it was hair all over the ground.
Everything.

1890
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,350
That's the reality of that life,
the get it.

1891
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:30,351
And then what's left?
The coyotes get that and then what's 

1892
01:30:30,351 --> 01:30:30,351
left,
you know,

1893
01:30:30,351 --> 01:30:33,870
any other scavengers get that.
That is a much more likely death.

1894
01:30:33,871 --> 01:30:37,060
And by hunter,
the hunter death is the least likely.

1895
01:30:37,061 --> 01:30:38,200
Yep,
absolutely.

1896
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:39,300
And in that sense,
again,

1897
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:44,301
to me it's like everything is going to 
die as long as they are not doing where 

1898
01:30:44,301 --> 01:30:46,470
you are wiping out with a species and as
long as they are not doing where you are

1899
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,620
at Dean and necessity pain to the 
process,

1900
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,660
then that's the nature of the business.

1901
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,000
Well,
what this woman is doing by running into

1902
01:30:54,001 --> 01:30:58,110
that restaurant and say it's not food,
it's violence,

1903
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:01,410
like you're kind of.
You're missing the whole point.

1904
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,530
You're missing the boat.
It's not violence.

1905
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:07,890
It's ending life so that you could eat 
it and yeah,

1906
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:11,850
it's kind of a crazy way to do it 
because we're detached from it.

1907
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,170
You're,
you're right about that.

1908
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:18,440
But again,
that's like a shitty communication 

1909
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,391
strategy because I'm sure she can have a
point where she's at it because there 

1910
01:31:20,391 --> 01:31:21,360
are issues that we.
Commercial farming that are nasty,

1911
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:22,590
terrible,
but you know,

1912
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,660
there's a way to communicate it to where
you are.

1913
01:31:24,661 --> 01:31:25,470
I would be like,
oh,

1914
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,880
you're right.
You'll make a good point.

1915
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:31,881
So maybe we can tweak the lows.
A tiny beat to do it in a more humane 

1916
01:31:31,881 --> 01:31:31,881
way.
Thought that they agree.

1917
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,570
You go like these are preaching to the 
choir.

1918
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:36,630
You only have like pan out there.
People who feel the exact same way.

1919
01:31:36,631 --> 01:31:39,560
You do agree with you.
Even if somebody is 80 percent,

1920
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,340
the other way you'll get are going to 
look at you and go like,

1921
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:43,560
Whoa,
you really went off the deep end.

1922
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,380
She's emotionally unbalanced and on top 
of that,

1923
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,960
that leads people to want to kill more 
chickens.

1924
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:54,440
It really does.
I mean I have this guy that I'm friends 

1925
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:58,341
with up in Alaska or in BC rather,
that runs this hunting camp and he would

1926
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:02,680
get these death threats from people 
because they would be hunting wolves and

1927
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:05,740
the reason why they hunt wolves,
they had one of their cows torn apart by

1928
01:32:05,741 --> 01:32:10,741
wolves.
These 30 wolves got ahold of a cow and 

1929
01:32:10,741 --> 01:32:11,830
ripped it apart while the people were in
the house and their hand.

1930
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:18,400
They look out the window and they see 
this wolves bringing down a cow and 

1931
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:18,400
kill.

1932
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,990
That is crazy stuff,
man.

1933
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:24,991
Do to look out your window and see this 
2000 pound animal get taken out by this 

1934
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,360
pack of wild,
murderous animals.

1935
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,220
It's pretty.
It's got to be pretty cool,

1936
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:35,310
but also pretty goddamn terrifying that 
fans and people do get killed by wolves 

1937
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:37,150
and they certainly did in large numbers 
back in the day,

1938
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:40,030
which is why the Little Red Riding Hood,
the big bad wolf.

1939
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,580
We don't think about that today because 
it's not an issue,

1940
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:47,581
but there was many,
many times throughout history where 

1941
01:32:47,581 --> 01:32:50,841
wolves and killed people,
if you google like wolf desk by people 

1942
01:32:50,841 --> 01:32:53,980
before we had eradicated like large 
populations of the wolves,

1943
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,470
there was actually a ceasefire in world 
war one.

1944
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,070
Remember that story?
Yeah.

1945
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:03,180
The Germans,
the Germans and the Russians actually 

1946
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:05,170
called a ceasefire because so many of 
them were getting killed by wolves.

1947
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:06,040
They said,
all right,

1948
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:07,210
let's just stop killing each other.

1949
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:11,310
Fuck these wolves up real bad.
We couldn't go back to kill each other.

1950
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:14,650
That's how nutty wolves are.
So these,

1951
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:17,050
these people were sending this guy death
threats,

1952
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:19,000
and he said,
every time you send me a death threat,

1953
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:24,001
I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts,
and so they stopped sending death 

1954
01:33:24,851 --> 01:33:26,740
threats,
not just stopped posting.

1955
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:31,960
This woman was like,
I'm going to post a new page every day 

1956
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:31,960
if you banned me,
I'm going to make a new name.

1957
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:31,960
And he goes,
okay.

1958
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:32,500
Every time you do that,
I'm gonna.

1959
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:34,300
Shoot a wolf in the guts.
Silence.

1960
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:39,380
Yeah.
I figured that the care of business 

1961
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,930
really is a way of communicating where 
he's just like,

1962
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,560
you think it's fun,
doesn't she thinks it's fun shooting the

1963
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:49,570
gun so far.
I mean there's really a way to 

1964
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:52,470
communicate to the guests of the job is 
like most people like to communicate and

1965
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,910
preach to the choir kind of way.

1966
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:58,950
Most people communicate in a way that's 
not going to see that anywhere you are 

1967
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:59,260
coming from the person they are talking 
with.

1968
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,950
They're only considering where they are 
coming through them and they want you to

1969
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,380
feel what they're feeling,
what they're thinking.

1970
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:10,381
Exactly.
Only they want to force their ideology 

1971
01:34:10,381 --> 01:34:12,370
on you and in that sense like veganism 
and vegetarianism is sort of a religion.

1972
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:15,160
Just like we're talking about atheism 
plus as a religion.

1973
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:19,190
So is being a Christian and so is being 
a mormon and you know,

1974
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,130
it's like its ideology.
It's all.

1975
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:22,280
It's all thought processes.
We,

1976
01:34:22,281 --> 01:34:24,250
you could label it and call it a 
religion.

1977
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,530
You could label it,
you know,

1978
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:27,280
call it a cult.
You could call it whatever you want,

1979
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,520
but it's just thought processes,
thought patterns that you want other 

1980
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:36,691
people to think.
You don't want them to express 

1981
01:34:36,691 --> 01:34:36,691
themselves and you can look at it from 
their point of view.

1982
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,630
No,
you just want.

1983
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:40,360
You want them to know and you're right,
this is not.

1984
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:42,070
Food is violence.
No,

1985
01:34:42,071 --> 01:34:43,690
it's food.
It actually is food.

1986
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:46,400
It's fucking chicken and I'm about to 
eat and you.

1987
01:34:46,401 --> 01:34:51,401
You crazy bitch.
You came in with all these meek fucking 

1988
01:34:51,401 --> 01:34:53,380
low blood sugar freaks holding up signs 
thinking you got to change the world.

1989
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:54,850
Changing Shit.
Go get a job.

1990
01:34:54,851 --> 01:34:56,530
What are you guys doing here at 2:00
in the afternoon?

1991
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:57,950
How are you feeding yourself?

1992
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,600
Do you have jobs?
What are you doing?

1993
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:04,640
Your fucking parents are putting you 
through schools that was going on here 

1994
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,850
and the thing there is like our many 
people's minds have you just changed by 

1995
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:07,670
doing zero,
zero point zero.

1996
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,880
So he's like,
even if you believe that you're 100 

1997
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,300
percent right in your message,
go back to the drawing board and look at

1998
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,160
that.
What you just did is bullshit because it

1999
01:35:16,161 --> 01:35:18,740
doesn't lead to any single person being 
convinced,

2000
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:21,260
so figure out a better communication 
strategy because you suck.

2001
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,330
Yeah.
She needs to get on some IOWASCA.

2002
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:29,680
Fucking elves would let her know.
Chickens are going to die no matter 

2003
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:29,680
what.
Bitch.

2004
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:29,870
Yeah.
I.

2005
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:31,820
Last time I did DMT,
I asked them about hunting.

2006
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,320
I asked it and I'm like,
okay,

2007
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:38,350
whatever.
That's literally what they said went 

2008
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:40,610
into,
and I had this thought in my head.

2009
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,430
I was like,
uh,

2010
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,730
his,
his hunting and is it,

2011
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:46,600
is it morally acceptable?
Is there anything wrong with hunting?

2012
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:47,180
And they're like,
it's fine.

2013
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:52,420
Of course they're like,
they're like showing me all these 

2014
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:52,420
different things about life.
Like,

2015
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:52,420
look,
you're going to die,

2016
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,020
dies.
Everything dies.

2017
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:59,021
It all goes into this thing and they're 
showing me all these fractal reality and

2018
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:03,370
I felt silly for asking that question 
that I have to tell you about that.

2019
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:08,380
My one and only dmt experience,
which is pretty fun because I did it 

2020
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,860
with Duncan Duncan.
He's hating it.

2021
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:15,920
Then he's like seeing God and the 
universe said he has these big smile on 

2022
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,670
his face and he's just like,
it's an I'm just like,

2023
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:23,500
I'm looking at him and I think you are 
the goofiest buster I've ever seen.

2024
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:27,830
Doesn't just laughing my ass off,
but I've not seen have him to seem and I

2025
01:36:27,831 --> 01:36:28,580
keep hitting it.

2026
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,850
So like there should be an at one point 
I think,

2027
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:34,760
whoa,
my perception is changing.

2028
01:36:34,761 --> 01:36:39,761
I am beginning to a vision because they 
see that Duncan ceiling is all warped 

2029
01:36:39,761 --> 01:36:43,181
and weird and then eventually come down 
from the experience and I realize that 

2030
01:36:43,181 --> 01:36:45,350
Dunkin is really just weird that it 
wasn't working.

2031
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:48,840
I was working in the sense that he was 
like the biggest,

2032
01:36:48,841 --> 01:36:50,250
uh,
it was like the biggest weed,

2033
01:36:50,251 --> 01:36:54,230
the high in the universe.
I had the big body high,

2034
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:59,350
you know,
I felt it really sinking into the couch 

2035
01:36:59,350 --> 01:36:59,610
and melting into the couch and I failed 
it.

2036
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:03,930
That like every thing was hilarious,
but I did not have a fish.

2037
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,300
Nope.
No one.

2038
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:07,430
And you know,
I took as much as Duncan beaten again.

2039
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:08,750
He was out there,
you know,

2040
01:37:08,751 --> 01:37:13,610
spacing out with Cosmo Molson 
discussion.

2041
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:18,611
You were like passing it back and forth.
So it's like you were getting at the 

2042
01:37:18,611 --> 01:37:21,521
same depth as what they do say that 
there's a certain percentage of people 

2043
01:37:21,521 --> 01:37:24,360
it doesn't work on and I'm sure that 
maybe the next time you take one more.

2044
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:29,410
What is it like a lot.
How long was after a while I was getting

2045
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:31,190
mad.
I was like,

2046
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:36,191
come on,
but we'd wherever,

2047
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:41,570
like I'll take a hit of weed and in the 
afternoon or in the evening and I'm 

2048
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:43,330
like,
I barely affects me.

2049
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,090
It's pleasant,
you know,

2050
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:46,190
he's reading glasses on,
but in a very male kind of way.

2051
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,190
If I do it before lunch,
I mean another,

2052
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:49,950
you won't.
I didn't.

2053
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:52,810
Once I met is a horrible mistake with 
David Seaman.

2054
01:37:52,811 --> 01:37:57,811
Like before it podcast he offered me 
that I took a hit and I didn't eat 

2055
01:37:57,811 --> 01:38:00,750
before and all of a sudden in the middle
of this podcast that he's like,

2056
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,170
I hear him talk and he heard that his 
voice is coming.

2057
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,510
The sentence is coming to an end and I'm
just like,

2058
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:12,160
oh fuck,
I don't know what I'm going to say.

2059
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:17,330
Oh my God.
Same substance,

2060
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:21,680
one heat versus painting another case 
and the 10 where it's like,

2061
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:25,610
it's also different kinds of weed to 
some really strong stuff,

2062
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,610
but that's a dmt things weird that it 
worked on Duncan and not you.

2063
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,400
I wonder if maybe it's one of those 
things,

2064
01:38:31,401 --> 01:38:36,401
man,
one of those things where you have that 

2065
01:38:36,401 --> 01:38:36,401
thing where you don't.
It doesn't work on,

2066
01:38:36,401 --> 01:38:36,730
you know,
maybe he was.

2067
01:38:36,731 --> 01:38:40,520
Find out a report after the next one.
Young lady.

2068
01:38:40,521 --> 01:38:43,730
You have amazing patients.
I'm very impressed with you.

2069
01:38:43,790 --> 01:38:46,110
We're going to end this podcast now 
because you are.

2070
01:38:46,111 --> 01:38:48,620
You're just going to score him yourself 
into a coma.

2071
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:54,020
Nikki's give daddy a kiss.
Alright,

2072
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:55,970
Daniella,
you're awesome.

2073
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:58,180
Next time we do this,
let's do it again and we'll,

2074
01:38:58,181 --> 01:38:59,820
we'll bring my kids will have a little 
party.

2075
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:01,220
You have a bunch of screaming back 
there.

2076
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:08,330
Much more or less boring guy.
Yeah.

2077
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,060
That's how we're going to do it.
Right.

2078
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:17,410
Thank you brother and your podcast.
Let people know how to get ahold of you 

2079
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:17,690
on twitter and your podcast.

2080
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:21,870
The Bolo lists in my first initial 
Daniel as a d,

2081
01:39:21,871 --> 01:39:26,871
e b o l e Lli on twitter,
and then a podcast is the drunken tower 

2082
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,040
with a t,
t,

2083
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,190
a o,
s t dot.

2084
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:33,960
If you guys look up Daniella calm,
which is Daniel plus,

2085
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:36,600
he at the end,
b o l e Lli.

2086
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:39,250
That probably refers you to every single
cells,

2087
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:44,270
so that would be the easier route and 
I'll just throw out there now I'm more 

2088
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,980
keen on a second podcast that's going to
happen at some point.

2089
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:50,450
There's a few dig artcore.
He stood in.

2090
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,460
You may dig this way.
It's but you know that's right now he's 

2091
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,090
on the back burner because I have to 
finish writing a book.

2092
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:59,820
I have to 17,000
things to take care of,

2093
01:39:59,821 --> 01:40:01,980
but hopefully by the beginning of the 
year or something like that.

2094
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,340
Beautiful.
All right man.

2095
01:40:03,341 --> 01:40:08,341
Thank you brother.
I really appreciate you coming on here 

2096
01:40:08,341 --> 01:40:09,160
and especially in tight circumstances 
like this will make it happen next time.

2097
01:40:09,161 --> 01:40:10,150
Okay,
I'll bring my kids.

2098
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,470
Thanks so much.
Little little kid party sound good,

2099
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,110

2100
01:40:20,111 --> 01:40:21,130

2102
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:27,570
Mark Gordon,
who's going to talk about a traumatic 

2103
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:29,950
brain injury and post traumatic stress 
disorder in soldiers were actually bring

2104
01:40:29,951 --> 01:40:34,951
on one of his patients who we're talking
about his experiences and hopefully we 

2105
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:38,230
could help some other folks out there 
that are experiencing a very similar,

2106
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:40,870
a similar situation.
So tomorrow.

2107
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:41,830
Much love.
See you soon.

2108
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,070
Hmm.

2109
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:54,010
We pulled it off.
