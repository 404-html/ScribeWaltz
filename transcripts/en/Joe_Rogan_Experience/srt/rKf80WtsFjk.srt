1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
Go to amazon.com forward slash Joe and
you will get one free audio book and you

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:08,310
can also try the service
for free for 30 days.

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:12,420
Amazon is an amazing service with
hundreds of thousands of titles.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,770
It is something you will absolutely
become addicted to if you are the type of

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,690
person that gets stuck in traffic a lot.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,850
I've completely abandoned radio.

7
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,410
I don't listen to anything anymore.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,540
I got a new car and my new card is
supposed to have XM radio but it didn't,

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,480
you know,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,313
and

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,800
so I'm supposed to like
drop it off at the,

12
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:32,920
uh,

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,690
the dealership,

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,680
first world problems,

15
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:35,514
anybody.

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,031
But,

17
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:36,864
um,

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,920
in the meantime I just started using my
iPhone in the car cause you know that

19
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:44,640
all Bluetooth's up now nowadays
and it works flawlessly.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,030
And I started listening to podcasts.

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,630
Oh really?

22
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,140
Yeah.

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,000
And most of it has been
this hardcore history.

24
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,320
And uh,

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,591
Dan,

26
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,270
I just started doing audio books as well.

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,630
I'm listening to a Carl
Sagan is demon haunted world.

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,333
And it's like,

29
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,060
why?

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,571
You know,

31
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,170
why just sit in your fucking
car listening to nonsense,

32
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,350
listening to dumb Djs and radios and you
could choose exactly what you listened

33
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,380
to.

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,710
I never even thought about it because I
always just relied on the XM cause opie

35
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,270
and Anthony are awesome and they're on it,

36
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,721
you know,

37
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:18,660
and I listened to them and I listened to
Howard and I would occasionally listen

38
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,111
to,

39
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,660
uh,

40
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:19,990
uh,

41
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,560
there was like an MMA show that they did.

42
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,394
And you know,

43
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:23,801
there's,

44
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:24,610
um,

45
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,040
the,

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,441
the,

47
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:25,560
uh,

48
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,790
sports guy for row,

49
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:27,570
I think it's pretty funny.

50
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,403
But other than that,

51
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,100
that was it.

52
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,640
I wouldn't,

53
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,120
you know,

54
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,330
like,

55
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,871
what am I doing?

56
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,140
I'm just just idly like
letting things come at me.

57
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,250
Like Channel Surfing instead
of choosing your watch.

58
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,890
Yeah.

59
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,250
And the beautiful thing about
audible is it's very like,

60
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,740
it's like a really extensive
collection of different kinds of books.

61
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:46,830
They have the war of art,

62
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,960
that Pressfield Book that
I talk about all the time,

63
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,670
they have the Stephen King books.

64
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,210
They have.

65
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,571
I mean,

66
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,280
it's just,

67
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,420
uh,

68
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,220
an awesome collection of
audio books and old shows.

69
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,900
They have a lot of standup comedy on it.

70
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,771
And a,

71
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:02,430
if you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

72
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,260
So go there,

74
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,130

75
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,430
It's fucking bad ass.

76
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,930
All right,

77
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,660
so good.

78
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,390
It's all good.

79
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,621
We're also bought two.

80
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,210
I know there's a long ass every,

81
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,130
a sponsor ads.

82
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,120
Okay,

83
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,090
so I'll to that next step also brought
to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,

84
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,361
n,

85
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:18,601
n,

86
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:18,751
I,

87
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:19,440
t.

88
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,741
A.

89
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,260
And a if you've never
been to on it before.

90
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,210
There's a lot of,

91
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,470
a lot of weirdness about that website.

92
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,041
You go there and you know,

93
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,180
what the fuck are you doing here?

94
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,490
What's,

95
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,830
what are you sound that's different today?

96
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,910
It looks like you guys,

97
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,910
you have a fitness equipment
that looks a lot like weapons.

98
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,420
You have maces and clubs and
something that looks like armor.

99
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,220
That's not what's going on folks.

100
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,150
That's not the dolce diet part from like
dolce with his ultimate grocery guide.

101
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,453
Um,

102
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,270
it's a company that's essentially
sells things for human performance.

103
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,381
And A,

104
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:52,080
I've said this so many times that it
sounds gross coming out of my mouth,

105
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,410
but I'm pretending that there's a
person out here has never heard it.

106
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,790
And that's where,

107
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,470
that's where I'm stuck.

108
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,170
That's my,

109
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
um,

110
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,940
that's my motivation.

111
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,750
And the Seattle primary
cares is the new a total.

112
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,020
Yes.

113
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,760
The new vitamin packs that is,

114
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,020
uh,

115
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,140
essentially with,

116
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,100
with a healthy diet.

117
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,360
It's a beautiful supplement.

118
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,480
We decided to go with a combination of,

119
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,670
we put a little bit of Alpha brain in it.

120
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,390
Um,

121
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,680
there's Spirulina,

122
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,840
which is God so fucking healthy for you,

123
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,880
a really healthy vitamin C.

124
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,490
The other listing of all
the ingredients is on,

125
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,120
um,

126
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,371
on,

127
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,210
on at.com as long as well as new mood.

128
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,440
So be aware of that.

129
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,041
If you,

130
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,670
uh,

131
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,590
if you take a Ssr i's,

132
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,190
I think they have the new mood.

133
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,391
It,

134
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,224
let me make sure,

135
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,130
because I don't think you're supposed
to really like a vitamin pack per se.

136
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,080
Like it's,

137
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,530
it's vitamins as well.

138
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,810
It's vitamins as well as,

139
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:44,050
uh,

140
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,160
other nutrients.

141
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,600
And the idea being that like
I take before every show,

142
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,450
I take four Alpha brains for
every show before the UFC.

143
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,550
I take four before I work out.

144
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,040
Like I,

145
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,681
I'm a,

146
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,720
I'm a big believer in supplementation.

147
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,920
I think it's like super important.

148
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:00,910
Um,

149
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,900
what this is is just like a
little bit of all the Groovy Shit.

150
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,940
There's like strong bone,

151
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,620
which is a bone supplement.

152
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,390
The shroom tech immune,

153
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,341
which is a,

154
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:13,840
a fascinating supplement
based on the quarter steps,

155
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:14,350
mushroom,

156
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,651
shroom,

157
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,670
tech sport and shroom Tech
Immune shroom tech sport is uh,

158
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,430
based on uh,

159
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,490
this quarter steps mushroom that um,

160
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:20,830
they,

161
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,340
they used in high herding a high
altitude hurting populations.

162
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:27,700
Notice that their cows would eat
these mushrooms and be more active.

163
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,841
So,

164
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,320
uh,

165
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,340
they started experimenting with
them and they found out that it,

166
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,540
I took four of them today
before I worked out.

167
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,471
Man,

168
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,800
it's amazing the difference between
when I take it and when I don't take it.

169
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,630
If I tell you one supplement
that on itself that is app,

170
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,250
you will absolutely feel it.

171
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,830
It's shroom tech sport.

172
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,060
That shit is incredible.

173
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:49,931
You know,

174
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:50,620
it's just,

175
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:50,901
it's,

176
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:51,120
it's,

177
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,620
if you're a like a
hardcore workout person,

178
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,010
you should check it out and check out
the science behind cordyceps mushrooms

179
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:58,360
because there's a bunch
of weird quarter steps.

180
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:58,750
Mushrooms,

181
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,970
like the type that
turned ants into zombies.

182
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,130
That's like a type of
quarter steps mushroom too,

183
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,440
but you don't want that kind,

184
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,520
but this a shroom tech
immune actually you're,

185
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,230
it tricks your body into thinking it's
got a cold and your body develops its

186
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:14,020
immune system to fight off
a cold that doesn't exist.

187
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,080
It's a really interesting
trickery that goes on.

188
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah,

189
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,610
it wasn't priced for,

190
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,080
is that per day?

191
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,093
Per Month?

192
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,371
What?

193
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,270
The bottles there?

194
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:24,790
Their bottles total primary pack,

195
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,331
is that what you're saying?

196
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,700
Which one of the 2,485
for those from tech thing.

197
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,301
Oh,

198
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:29,370
that's a bottle of them.

199
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,010
Okay.

200
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,660
Yeah.

201
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,940
You take one of us.

202
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,890
I take,

203
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,700
you could take,

204
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,290
let me see how many is in each bottle.

205
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,210
30 capsules and he just got down.

206
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,293
Just go down.

207
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:38,801
Well,

208
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:39,634
if you look,

209
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,480
look at it this way.

210
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,700
If you drink like a cup
of coffee at Starbucks,

211
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,540
it's two bucks.

212
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:43,870
Right.

213
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,120
If you want to get some
energy before you work out,

214
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:47,590
you grab a cup of coffee that's two bucks.

215
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,430
It's way more than two bucks,

216
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,120
right?

217
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,230
It's a little bit more how much?

218
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,280
Four bucks.

219
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,113
But I get to train to,

220
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,123
um,

221
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,230
I,

222
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,320
I guarantee you that,

223
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,880
uh,

224
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,713
you're,

225
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,261
you know,

226
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:03,261
like the amount of effect that you're
going to get is a worthwhile effect to the

227
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,640
point where you would
look at it the same way.

228
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,980
Looking at a cup of coffee before workout,

229
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,180
which I like to do too.

230
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:09,770
It's,

231
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,070
it has a real impact man.

232
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,371
This,

233
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:11,651
it's,

234
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,484
it's pretty sweet.

235
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,420
It's nice to have like there's
a lot of supplements like,

236
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:15,601
man,

237
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,434
am I feeling this?

238
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,300
But when I take shroom tech,

239
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:18,541
I'm like,

240
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,291
God damn,

241
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,310
this is a amazing,

242
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,230
it's amazing how much more pep you have.

243
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:22,951
You know?

244
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:24,270
I would like to see it measured.

245
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,040
We need to do it with athletics.

246
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,061
It's hard though.

247
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,000
It's like you,

248
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:28,131
you,

249
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,340
you do things with athletes.

250
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,130
You got to know like if it's the same guy,

251
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,080
you got to know like what
was his workout this week?

252
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,450
Did he lift weights this week
and not do it the other week?

253
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,291
Yeah.

254
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,020
How do you know like did he fuck
all night that he'd go to sleep?

255
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,053
It's like,

256
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,080
it's hard to like completely quantify
whether or not fitness supplements because

257
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:48,360
the edge they give you is fairly subtle.

258
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:48,871
You know,

259
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,310
like the edge and Alpha brain.

260
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,690
Fairly subtle.

261
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:51,920
It,

262
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,630
it actually used to be a
little stronger in Alpha brain.

263
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:55,141
It used to be,

264
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:58,430
have a little bit more of an effect
where I used to only take three or two,

265
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,041
like a tolerance.

266
00:06:59,041 --> 00:06:59,250
We're not,

267
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,390
but too many people had
an intolerance for it.

268
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,240
Don't highlight that woman's for judge.

269
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,073
Yeah,

270
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,010
don't do that dude.

271
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,850
That's Rudy.

272
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,170
Well maybe it's photo-shopped.

273
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,593
She was well,

274
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,541
she's agent.

275
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,160
Well there's a lot of um,

276
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,323
that have uh,

277
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,230
those booty genetics being a rude racist.

278
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,420
Oh,

279
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,750
because it's stereotypical
because of the earthquake.

280
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:21,410
The earthquake gave him
big booties on their butts.

281
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,870
Is that the pay all don't
live in Japan and fuck head.

282
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:28,610
There's a thing called China is
a million billion Asians there.

283
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,730
I know all about them.

284
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,500
Orient your,

285
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,260
your sound rude as fuck on it.com.

286

if you've been there before,

293
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:40,320
it's probably the total primary care.

294
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:40,830

295
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,830

It's in the way.

332
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,181

334
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:00,931

338
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,561
Yeah.

339
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,090
Try is going to be a wash.

340
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,700
All of that beautiful and
billion dollar apartments.

341
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,300
Oh God.

342
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,990
Fucked there.

343
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,321
Fuck.

344
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:11,160
That's going under water,

345
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:11,490
man.

346
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,050
How far up is it going to go into water?

347
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,891
It's going to be far.

348
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,900
Do you guys talking about the years?

349
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,190
There is without a doubt.

350
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,570
There's some raising of
the ocean levels and uh,

351
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:21,951
they're,

352
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,950
they're going to have an issue with Lara,

353
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,950
the increased frequency
of tropical storms and a,

354
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,610
their impact on the east coast.

355
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,970
And it's very likely that there's
portions of the east coast,

356
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:36,390
especially like the low areas
of New York and port cities,

357
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,370
they're going to get
hit hard by this stuff.

358
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,230
The Shit we saw in New Jersey.

359
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,910
They call that a hundred year storm,

360
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,040
but according to Shane Smith from vice.com
who I quote all the time cause he's

361
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,060
my man crush.

362
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,010
Um,

363
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,010
he says that those hundred year storms
are going to be placed again taking place

364
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:53,940
two and three times a year,

365
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,010
two or three times a year straight from
nothing from once every hundred years to

366
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:58,740
two or three times a year.

367
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,760
He said that's the future.

368
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,130
He said if the climate,

369
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,880
climate change happens at the base,

370
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,330
it's very difficult.

371
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,180
When will that happen to time?

372
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,420
I don't know.

373
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:09,931
They could,

374
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:10,890
it could happen soon,

375
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,540
but do you mean like a thousand years?

376
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,500
No,

377
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,741
no,

378
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:13,951
no.

379
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,060
Like within our lifetime,

380
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,780
the issue is that we've fucked up
the atmosphere so much that there's,

381
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,700
there's a negative effect
that's happening on,

382
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,593
um,

383
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,070
on the planet because of it.

384
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,330
Now it's very controversial and that's
the Republicans don't want to even,

385
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,960
it's like,

386
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,380
it becomes like a conservative
versus a liberal talking point.

387
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:34,831
Hi.

388
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,150
Why don't the Republicans care?

389
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,980
Because they think it's
going to inhibit business.

390
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,210
Okay.

391
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,050
It's really interesting.

392
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,520
It's a fascinating study because one hand,

393
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,700
they have a point that the climate on
the earth has changed radically over the

394
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,690
course of its existence.

395
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
And that,

396
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,070
you know,

397
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,450
during the dinosaur era,

398
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:54,701
the,

399
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:57,180
the climate was very
different than it is today.

400
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
And we also know there was an ice age
just 10,000 plus years ago or half of

401
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,170
North America was covered in ice.

402
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,790
So the climate has varied.

403
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,110
Um,

404
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,881
so we,

405
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:12,630
we know that regardless of
how humans have affected it,

406
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,550
the climate changes all the time.

407
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,830
So there's a lot of people that don't
want to look at some of the mitigating

408
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:20,664
factors.

409
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,650
And one of them is this,

410
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,830
the heating up due to carbon dioxide and
due to fluorocarbons and all the shit

411
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:29,850
that people use.

412
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,340
But you know what another
one is what cow farts.

413
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,970
Oh yeah,

414
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,990
it's really bad.

415
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,070
But we have a lot more cows now,

416
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:35,904
right?

417
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,900
We make all the cows probably congestion.

418
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,551
Well,

419
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:39,810
if you think back though,

420
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,390
to like maybe 10,000 years ago,

421
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,970
who knows how many counselor were
and there was also a mammoth.

422
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,310
Can you imagine what mammoths far too?

423
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,860
Like birds.

424
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,631
Think about,

425
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:49,440
how about buffalo?

426
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,310
Think about that shit.

427
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,840
Herds of Buffalo.

428
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,190
Think about how many
buffalo would be that farts.

429
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,070
Millions of buffaloes just
crack and farts all day.

430
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,570
That never talked about
that with the Indians.

431
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,733
The old times.

432
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,281
Well,

433
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:03,581
you know,

434
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,301
that's a real,

435
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,650
it's a real issue in India like this,

436
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:07,030
this,

437
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,690
the population like suffers
because of like anywhere you are.

438
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:13,840
If you're living around that
you're breathing in shit gas.

439
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,060
Yeah.

440
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,220
And that's what you breathing
in and it's a contributor to,

441
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,710
you know,

442
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,030
to,

443
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,560
to bad shit in the atmosphere.

444
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,393
It's methane,

445
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,020
it's methane and it's,

446
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,860
it's uh,

447
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,693
there's also,

448
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,910
there's other kinds of
toxins that are carried in a,

449
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:30,220
in that gas to what happened to India.

450
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,683
There's silly,

451
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,690
it used to be the place known for like
free thinking and Zen and now it's the

452
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,380
fucking gang rape plus.

453
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:38,891
Yeah,

454
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,340
right.

455
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,330
They went bad.

456
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,830
Something went wrong.

457
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,880
So the opposite.

458
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,070
I think it's an overpopulation issue.

459
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,470
I think when humans
get to a certain level,

460
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,890
life almost gets devalued and
they just lose their humanity.

461
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,060
I think that's why in China,

462
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,980
like with the overpopulation thing,

463
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,790
we've all heard horrific stories about
people drowning female babies and shit

464
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,710
because they can only have one baby.

465
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,760
You know there's madness.

466
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,250
That's,

467
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,720
that's absolute madness,

468
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,510
you know?

469
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,340
I mean that is,

470
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,560
that's humanities.

471
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,820
If once you've drowned your fucking baby,

472
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,770
like where are you going?

473
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,810
Like well what is this life about?

474
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,610
You've dragged your own
baby cause it was a girl.

475
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,800
What is this life for you?

476
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,110
And I understand that we need
girls to you fucking crazy asshole.

477
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,540
But it's everybody looks at her
and it'd be the ones having them,

478
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,261
but they're also,

479
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:30,190
there's so few they need like
there's so few resources there.

480
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,310
I mean it's terms of like there's so
much poverty that when a son is born that

481
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,860
song can go to work for you and that Sun
can like he can take over the business.

482
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,190
They can,

483
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,730
you know,

484
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,563
whereas they,

485
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,120
they feel like a woman can't do that.

486
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,740
Then a woman that was happening as much
now that like times have changed over

487
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,820
the last 25 years.

488
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:48,130
I'm sure it has there to change,

489
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,470
but I don't think it's changed
as much as it has here.

490
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,630
And when the pig dramas,

491
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,900
babies per capita,

492
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,010
no babies,

493
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,461
cause they're like,

494
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:54,701
Nah,

495
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,930
you know I can do accounting work.

496
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,801
Oh Man.

497
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,830
There was a horrible show on HBO about
people that were selling their kids

498
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,630
because China is so poor.

499
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,680
People would sell the kid,

500
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,570
they would sell them up to
like five and six years old.

501
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,673
And this guy,

502
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,370
this guy was yelling because his brother,

503
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,670
he was five and I think his brother
was younger than five and his dad was

504
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:15,550
selling his brother and he's just said
how he never forgave his dad because his

505
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,600
dad sold his brother,

506
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,710
his younger brother,

507
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,920
man,

508
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,251
I sold,

509
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:18,910
his brother,

510
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,230
sold them and he was like to,

511
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,130
you know,

512
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,370
sold them off to some fucking white
people or something and wanted her baby.

513
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,360
Oh that's not even a doctor
that's giving them money.

514
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,410
That's what's going on.

515
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,280
You know what?

516
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:31,840
People were buying babies.

517
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,180
It's better than stealing a baby.

518
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,500
Well I guess the whole
thing is just chaos.

519
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,130
It's just,

520
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,560
I think it's the same
issue as the India issue,

521
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,640
obviously different cultures,

522
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:44,260
but I think that kind of
overpopulation is really fucking bad.

523
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:44,860
And My,

524
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,120
my evidence is I feel better
when I'm in small towns.

525
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,190
Like when I go to boulder.

526
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,700
Yeah.

527
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,170
Or,

528
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,570
um,

529
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,381
like I was in,

530
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:54,950
um,

531
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,210
what's that place up in Utah
where everybody goes skiing,

532
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,050
fail.

533
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,560
Nothing yet.

534
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:00,681
No,

535
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,640
that's in Colorado.

536
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,781
Whatever it was.

537
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:03,890
Do Your valley or some shit.

538
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,220
Okay.

539
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,200
We went to Utah is really small to as
like so calm everybody's tribe and nice

540
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,034
and slow.

541
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,251
Yeah.

542
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,360
Nothing's getting done.

543
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,373
There's no art.

544
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,310
There's no chaos.

545
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,091
There's no craziness.

546
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:16,140
Has No bad ass music club
that you can go here.

547
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,870
Bad ass new bands coming up.

548
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,490
There's no comedy clubs up there.

549
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,530
But there's also like the less
of the negative impact of humans,

550
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,460
the constant influx of information
that we're getting from each other.

551
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,640
And I think it makes you go crazy when
it's too much to humanize everybody.

552
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,510
That's how it is in New York too.

553
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,040
It's like you don't look at
anybody who's like a person,

554
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,280
you know?

555
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,330
Then we'd nods her head and say,

556
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,010
hello.

557
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,770
Yeah,

558
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,820
New York is so odd,

559
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:38,570
man.

560
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,410
It's so odd.

561
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,941
It's,

562
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:40,320
it's a,

563
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,830
it's an experiment in con condensation.

564
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,740
It's an experiment and and
jamming people into tight places.

565
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,450
Yeah.

566
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,140
So many per per block.

567
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,120
Those apartments are ridiculous.

568
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,770
I looked at some people's apartments.

569
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:51,981
I'm like,

570
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,300
how the fuck is that?

571
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,460
How can you make people pay for that?

572
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,180
Then I went,

573
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,621
I went,

574
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:57,230
uh,

575
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,930
I saw a place that shower was
just opened into the kitchen,

576
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
like the shower door,

577
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,270
which just in the room and then
the bathroom was somewhere else.

578
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,130
Oh my toilet with somewhere else.

579
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:09,080
But the shower just opened
right there and I'm like,

580
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:09,914
what do

581
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,163
I,

582
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,510
well it is in its price range.

583
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:14,720
I'm like,

584
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,321
no,

585
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:16,130
I'll get a row.

586
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,240
So stupid.

587
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,580
No,

588
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,600
I finally found something.

589
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,410
It's,

590
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm,

591
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,530
I looked at some of them that my
friends had when I lived there.

592
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:24,610
I didn't live in New York.

593
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:25,810
I lived in new Rochelle.

594
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,770
I mean I lived in New York.

595
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:30,280
I just didn't live in the city cause
I had a car when I first came and I

596
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,450
couldn't afford to park it
there and I also couldn't,

597
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,780
um,

598
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,070
I needed to be able to drive to gigs a
lot and it was hard to get out of the

599
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:39,401
city.

600
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,330
It's not that easy.

601
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,141
So I was like,

602
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:41,411
you know,

603
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:41,640
and I,

604
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,280
I shouldn't,

605
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,000
I can't,

606
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,833
I can't live here.

607
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,000
But when you would tell people about it,

608
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,680
it was like a thing of shame.

609
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,030
It was weird that I would tell him I
lived in new Rochelle and then like

610
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,550
you don't live in the city if
you don't live in the city,

611
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:56,290
like they would look down on you.

612
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,440
I absolutely remember,

613
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,980
I remember it so much
that telling you today,

614
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:01,420
like when I said that I
didn't live in the city,

615
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,254
I live in new Rochelle.

616
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,560
It's almost like a feeling of shame.

617
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,870
Felt it you felt the thing of like,

618
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,713
yeah,

619
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,753
definitely.

620
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,780
I felt the,

621
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,320
um,

622
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,491
uh,

623
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:10,380
almost like an ad or inadequacy.

624
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,390
I have never observed a geographical
bias as much as New York to New Yorkers.

625
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,553
It's so weird.

626
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,850
There's nothing like it.

627
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,081
It's nothing like it.

628
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,070
They lose 12 players.

629
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,080
They would rate higher if
they came from New York.

630
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:22,923
Then from somewhere else,

631
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,460
House Jab,

632
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:26,870
Judah food as

633
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,280
Brooklyn tattooed on his back,

634
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,820
you know?

635
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,653
Yeah.

636
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,470
You know,

637
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,280
it's uh,

638
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,521
the,

639
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:31,791
the,

640
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,400
the I iPhone.

641
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm,

642
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,860
I'm from New York.

643
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,000
Toughness claims.

644
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:38,150
If you know you were in nom in this shit,

645
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,801
that's all it takes.

646
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:39,800
Flying overhead day.

647
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,893
Just relax.

648
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,501
There's a,

649
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,030
there's an issue also with,

650
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:44,300
uh,

651
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,130
people that can't it up
because of the weather.

652
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,900
You're going to get that.

653
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,500
You're going to get people cutting up,

654
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,070
you know,

655
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,100
the overpopulation plus
insanely shit weather.

656
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,990
Sometimes it gets,

657
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,860
it gets bad.

658
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,750
There's a lot of attitude there.

659
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,340
I wonder how long it's going to take
for you to get enough fight your first

660
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,373
couple,

661
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,551
couple of days.

662
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,710
You've got to have that start

663
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,243
again.

664
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,340
Yeah.

665
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,600
The only pick on guys.

666
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:09,841
That's,

667
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,674
sorry.

668
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,310
That's the best way to get into
fights around says try not to get hit.

669
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:15,790
Yeah.

670
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,980
Want to fuck around with big people.

671
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:17,800
Yeah.

672
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,210
Some people think that getting
hits like a badge of courage,

673
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,163
you know,

674
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,080
take one and then I feel my own
blood and that's what I get.

675
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,913
Crazy.

676
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,143
Hmm.

677
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,760
It seems like you're approaching this,

678
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,800
this whole endeavor in the wrong way.

679
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,280
Let's just talk hunter.

680
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,210
When they're not looking at you,

681
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,230
there's a whole a data
sheet in front of you.

682
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:38,400
Let's go over the numbers here.

683
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,610
Spleen.

684
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:39,770
Well,

685
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,480
you get benefit versus cost ratio.

686
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,980
See how my nose has no blood.

687
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,810
So I got to talk about
something because a,

688
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:49,790
on the podcast yesterday we
talked about this website where a,

689
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,341
this guy,

690
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:54,120
Lloyd Irvin has this a marketing
website and we were making fun of it.

691
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,310
And so he called me up today and uh,

692
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,080
he was upset that we made fun of it.

693
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,951
But I told him,

694
00:18:58,951 --> 00:18:59,161
I said,

695
00:18:59,161 --> 00:18:59,850
listen,

696
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,560
we can't make fun of something that's
not stupid and if something looks

697
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,400
ridiculous,

698
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,670
it's,

699
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,390
I mean like you insult people's
intelligence and that there,

700
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,300
it becomes humor,

701
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,620
you know?

702
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,790
And his attitude is very interesting
because he's a very successful marketer.

703
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,560
And one thing I gotta to say,

704
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:17,394
it's like it's,

705
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,180
I don't know,

706
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,540
like the,

707
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,710
the guys had some,

708
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,701
some issues.

709
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,360
I know,

710
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,400
but I don't know both sides of the story.

711
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,950
I just know all the bullshit and the
rumors that you hear on the Internet.

712
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,430
But as far as like what
he's been able to do,

713
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,350
he's a phenomenal marketer.

714
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,290
Like this guy figured out how to get
like way bigger schools than anybody else

715
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,710
has ever to do and then teaches people
how to do it and it's super effective.

716
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,000
He's the Whitney of Jujitsu,

717
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,373
the Whitney Cummings,

718
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,340
she,

719
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,670
she,

720
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,630
you love her dude.

721
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,950
You like bring her up all the time.

722
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,530
She's your example of like a hard worker.

723
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:48,900
Yeah.

724
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,733
Yeah.

725
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,300
Well the dude's definitely a hard worker,

726
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,070
but I think in that,

727
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,530
that that style of marketing,

728
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,810
it leaves you so open to be criticized.

729
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,710
And I'm aware of that personally myself
because of my involvement with on it

730
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,950
because there's been times where the
people at Onnit have made like an ad or

731
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,910
something or said something and add that.

732
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,110
I thought it was ridiculous.

733
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,300
So I made fun of it on the show.

734
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,720
I would come on the podcast and we
play the guide with the muscles.

735
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:16,890
That was like with the girl.

736
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,180
Remember that ad that we played?

737
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,210
When was it 20 tech make
talking about Kissing Mickey.

738
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:21,840
I talk.

739
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:21,991
Yeah,

740
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:23,130
the guy kissing his biceps,

741
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,040
but we don't have the other part
where there was like a girl.

742
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,420
They might have removed that immediately.

743
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,283
Why can't we get,

744
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,041
I'll get it.

745
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,341
I'll get it.

746
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,150
I'll tell RBC said,

747
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,550
well I don't know if that weight lifted
dude wants it out cause I remember his

748
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:36,600
girl was pissed that I talked about
and laughed at that and we met the guy.

749
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,690
Everybody knows now I'll
have Aubrey said it over.

750
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,730
I'll have Aubrey centered over,

751
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,150
but my point is I make,

752
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,650
I make fun of myself.

753
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,790
I think the only reason why someone would
not want to be made fun of is first of

754
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:50,081
all,

755
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:51,490
you think it would affect your business,

756
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,324
which is valid,

757
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,290
but also because you don't want to look
at the fact that what you're doing most

758
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:56,530
of it.

759
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:56,920
Yeah.

760
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,641
Well you make it fun of me.

761
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,910
It's like you should sign.

762
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,891
This is what I told them.

763
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,724
This is the other thing I told him,

764
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,001
boy,

765
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:01,900
cause I like Lloyd.

766
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,030
You know my interactions with
him have always been cool.

767
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,150
Even though I think the
marketing shits and salting,

768
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:07,901
I said,

769
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,220
you need to do this.

770
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,120
If you're going to do these things and
then give them to somebody to look at

771
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,590
somebody who's like a critical person,

772
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,011
it was going to go,

773
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:15,371
no,

774
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:15,611
no,

775
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:15,911
no,

776
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:16,181
no,

777
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:16,421
no.

778
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:17,170
Send them to me.

779
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:17,650
I'll tell him,

780
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,830
I'll tell you what the
fuck's wrong with it.

781
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,291
You,

782
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,420
you can't make people think
you think they're stupid.

783
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,330
You can't because then you're funny
because then you become funny.

784
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:28,560
You become a silly person when
you know you write drafts to your,

785
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,860
to to yourself.

786
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,390
He wrote an email to himself.

787
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,760
He got busted like writing an
email and a her tending it.

788
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,940
It was this expert that was
emailing him and his interest.

789
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,060
The way he looked at
it was very different.

790
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,750
Mr. Keith,

791
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,130
he was,

792
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,990
this is how he looked at
it was very fascinating.

793
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,831
He was like,

794
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:49,150
if you saw an ad on TV and a
celebrities endorsing something,

795
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,250
do you think they really say those words?

796
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,230
Like the reading something
that someone wrote?

797
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,800
Oh yeah,

798
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,210
so I,

799
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,300
I thought it was interesting,

800
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:56,410
like that's how he looked at it.

801
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:59,500
So he looked at it like he's
creating a bit of fiction,

802
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:02,770
but ultimately his product is legitimate.

803
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,820
That's how he looked at it,

804
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,650
which is I kind of,

805
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,330
I see that kind of a leap.

806
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:07,900
Yeah,

807
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,733
well not really.

808
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,723
Not really.

809
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,120
If,

810
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,830
if the product wasn't legitimate,

811
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,600
I would say yes.

812
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,700
But since the pro,

813
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I know for a fact that that guy has made
a lot of people a lot of money with his

814
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:21,341
techniques,

815
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,420
I guess marketing techniques.

816
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,330
He's made them a lot of
fucking money so it does work.

817
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,230
So it's interesting that he's
saying what he's saying is it like,

818
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,790
what are you doing for putting on a show?

819
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,601
Disney had that with,

820
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,400
with people come out of a
movie and everyone like,

821
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:33,551
oh,

822
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,061
it was great.

823
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,751
It was amazing.

824
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:35,650
And they kept out later.

825
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,900
They're all Disney
employees and it's like,

826
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,351
oh,

827
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:42,850
all the people that were saying that
you're making people believe that this

828
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:44,430
person is not the person misleading.

829
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,180
Treat them like they're fools.

830
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,230
And then it becomes funny.

831
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,850
We had a guy on our message board,

832
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:49,180
Brian,

833
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,080
I don't know if you remember this,

834
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,590
who was a musician and he started uh,

835
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,830
making threads about his
music under other names.

836
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:58,330
It didn't know that we
could find that out.

837
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,940
He didn't understand why the people
that are like not Internet savvy,

838
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:04,990
they don't understand that.

839
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,120
That actually happens a lot.

840
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,963
A lot.

841
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,160
I love when people got called
out on that when they're like,

842
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:09,551
okay,

843
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:09,811
flap,

844
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:11,110
oh spam or whatever it is.

845
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,230
You just know the type of writing
and everyone just calls you on it.

846
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,040
Well we would get that a lot when
we were we people and we still do,

847
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,060
when you ban people,

848
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:20,460
you really only band there,

849
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,723
their persona,

850
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,210
they can always come back always
like go through proxies or whatever.

851
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:27,130
And then those are like
the Internet savvy guys.

852
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,090
They know how to do it.

853
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,740
But like a guy like this musician
guy was just being a douchebag.

854
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,440
Like you're pretending you're music
is awesome and you tell anybody,

855
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,090
oh my God,

856
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,240
that Shit I've ever seen.

857
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:37,960
Like,

858
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,190
and maybe he's a good guy,

859
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,270
but sometimes people make shit decisions
and you might make a shit decision

860
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,040
because she grew up with
a bunch of fucking idiots.

861
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,560
All right?

862
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,070
It's not,

863
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,600
I'm not blaming you if you decided to
write a fucking thread and you know,

864
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,350
make some shit about your music
being awesome when it's really you.

865
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,090
I'm not blaming you.

866
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:57,200
I really am not.

867
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,420
But what I'm saying is you are,

868
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,870
you're a look at it.

869
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,190
Look,

870
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,450
look at your life as a mathematical
equation from birth to the point where you

871
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:08,060
find yourself making threads
about your own music.

872
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,540
Okay?

873
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,310
Clearly you're in debt.

874
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,210
You're,

875
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,440
you're in some sort.

876
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:14,630
You've not eve not balanced.

877
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:16,160
Your sheets are not balanced.

878
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,840
You're in some sort of a debt type
situation where you're functioning and

879
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:20,674
properly.

880
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,590
Right?

881
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,311
And what is that?

882
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,990
Is it because you didn't get enough love?

883
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,940
Is it because you didn't
get enough education?

884
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,250
Did you get enough love or education?

885
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,450
You were abused.

886
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,370
You grew up around illiterates.

887
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,323
You grew up around.

888
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,280
I grew up around religious folk.

889
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,110
It's something went wrong.

890
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:37,490
A lot of comics do that too though,

891
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,500
but they're weak bitches.

892
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,810
I think it's because I think it's
whatever you think your talent level is,

893
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,400
is not met by the,

894
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,090
um,

895
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,420
by the respects it's getting
and it just drives you crazy.

896
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,480
I ain't got to do something.

897
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,910
That's a really common thing with comics.

898
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:50,780
It was a cop.

899
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,340
I remember having it myself.

900
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:53,990
Completely unwarranted.

901
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,640
When I first started doing comedy.

902
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:55,821
Hi,

903
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:56,830
this is Bob Smith from it.

904
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,470
My frequency,

905
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,850
I'm calling about artists or fear fears,

906
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:00,650
a great young talent on this guy.

907
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,810
I saw him absolutely kill.

908
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,880
When you start off doing comedy,

909
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:09,370
you never realize that you're on
essentially like fourth grade,

910
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,040
10,

911
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,440
a 10 year path to competence.

912
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,281
You know?

913
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:13,670
And when,

914
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,810
when I started out,

915
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,250
I had done all these other things,

916
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:18,740
like athletic things and I had
gotten pretty good pretty quick.

917
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,030
It's stuff like martial arts.

918
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:20,781
So I was like,

919
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:23,150
I'm just going to get awesome
at this and just watch comedy.

920
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,120
Yeah,

921
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,640
no,

922
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,473
you need to.

923
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,820
And then somewhere along the
line you also realize you're,

924
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:29,010
you're,

925
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,590
you're learning yourself too.

926
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:32,000
You're not just learning jokes.

927
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:34,370
You're learning yourself through life.

928
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,780
Like standup is a,

929
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,261
is a,

930
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:38,270
an occupation and it's an art form,

931
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,340
but it's also a path of life.

932
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:40,880
Like there's,

933
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,170
it's like there's,

934
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:45,890
in creating anything you're
also finding out about yourself.

935
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
That's my theory on
why beginning standups,

936
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,810
we'll always do jokes about
how they can not get laid.

937
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:54,360
How they can't beat anywhere up there was
give over to the Kroger but you could,

938
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,230
you could take me sir
or Ma'am or whatevers.

939
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,640
But then they stopped saying that
because they hit whatever age.

940
00:25:59,641 --> 00:25:59,900
You're like,

941
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,201
oh no,

942
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:03,530
I can beat a few people up here
and I get laid once in a while.

943
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,820
I'm not going to this little kid anymore.

944
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,380
You get more confidence.

945
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,450
Your style of comedy too.

946
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,990
It's like you would never say that someone
could beat you up if you thought that

947
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:12,824
you could beat them up.

948
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,980
Cause that would sort of invalidate
everything else you're saying your,

949
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,020
your whole style of comedy is like,

950
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:19,220
well you might not want to hear this,

951
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:20,150
but here's the truth.

952
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,290
You know,

953
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,580
and as soon as you start pretending one
way or the other to sort of placate or

954
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,423
sometimes,

955
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,680
well it's new comics,

956
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:28,281
all we do that,

957
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:28,970
then it goes away.

958
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,820
Kind of feel like you have to do that
because you want to make them like you.

959
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,920
It's like so bad,

960
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:34,754
so bad.

961
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,760
That's the only,

962
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,740
that's the hardest part.

963
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:39,560
In the beginning it's like just
actually figuring out how to do it,

964
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,320
how to just get in front of people and
not look like a Douche bag and you don't

965
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:44,070
realize what you,

966
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,060
how do you come off either.

967
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,260
It's hard to figure that out.

968
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,340
So while it's not,

969
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:47,740
yeah.

970
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,481
And again,

971
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,680
I don't blame the people.

972
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:51,600
I don't want to talk to them
if they're bad at comedy.

973
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,330
It's very rare that I
want to talk to anybody,

974
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,210
but I don't blame him.

975
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,631
I don't,

976
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:54,931
you know,

977
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:55,740
it's like,

978
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,580
it ain't easy.

979
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:56,800
It's,

980
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,310
it's doesn't make a lot of
sense what you're doing.

981
00:26:59,311 --> 00:26:59,491
You're,

982
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,920
you're up there talking and
it makes people like laugh.

983
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,990
Like how the fuck does that work?

984
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,550
It's a long process.

985
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,410
So a lot of the secret like
what is going to be code unlock.

986
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,750
Yeah.

987
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,850
Well that's why classes or gross,

988
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,330
that's why people teaching those
classes are gross because you can't,

989
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,870
first of all the people that
teach almost invariably suck.

990
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,933
Yeah.

991
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,730
Okay.

992
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,690
Amy Schumer's pulling up.

993
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,591
That's the best.

994
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:22,801
Uh,

995
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:25,140
I told Peter Jennings
class once I audited it.

996
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,100
Yeah.

997
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,010
Oh Jesus Christ.

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:29,850

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:30,961
Oh,

1012
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,400
He's the only guy that I've ever actively
like cock blocked from going on a

1013
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:54,060
stage.

1014
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,451
Yeah.

1015
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:58,170
I told that story was Chris Mcguire
was fucking auditioning for Mitzi.

1016
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,033
Hey fucker.

1017
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,481
Amy Schumer,

1018
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,314
Michelle Ladies and gentlemen.

1019
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Chris Mcguire was a
auditioning for Mitzi and uh,

1020
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,130
he was going up at an open mic night
and for some reason she thought it'd be

1021
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:10,680
funny to let Peter Chan
host the open mic night.

1022
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,240
Like,

1023
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,200
I don't know what the
fuck that was all about.

1024
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,850
She's so crazy.

1025
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,960
She was so awesome,

1026
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:16,520
you know?

1027
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:16,960
Yeah.

1028
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,521
I know.

1029
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,810
I don't go to a store anymore,

1030
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,970
but she was awesome.

1031
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:25,440
Which would Mitzi short did like
her just keeping that place alive.

1032
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:26,820
Her creating that fucking place.

1033
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,953
The funny farm.

1034
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,880
It's amazing if you have all of these men,

1035
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,920
you've got to have one of these coco cafe.

1036
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:32,790
You don't drink coffee though,

1037
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:33,330
Huh?

1038
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,163
Is that caffeine?

1039
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,550
Caffeine.

1040
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,240
You drink soda?

1041
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,631
Nothing.

1042
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,111
Look at you.

1043
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:38,400
You fucking sexy bitch.

1044
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:39,480
It tastes healthy.

1045
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,010
It tastes like chocolate milk,

1046
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,230
but it's got a little
bit of caffeine in it.

1047
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,670
It's so delicious.

1048
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,710
They stay sent us a fucking
shitload of that stuff.

1049
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:47,941
Yeah.

1050
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:49,980
You wouldn't let them host
from McGuire showcase thing.

1051
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,191
Yeah,

1052
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:50,581
I wouldn't.

1053
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:51,300
I came in,

1054
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:51,600
um,

1055
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,150
and I called up the comic stores had
fucked that I'm hosting open Mike easily

1056
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,220
after news radio.

1057
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,510
Could have been in Fairfax,

1058
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,833
Fairfax,

1059
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,163
sure factor.

1060
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,310
So you hosted the open mic part,

1061
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,960
but the fucking with
five people in the room.

1062
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,381
Oh yeah.

1063
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:07,080
I started the show off at four in
the afternoon or whatever it was.

1064
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,983
Yes,

1065
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,943
I was there.

1066
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,530
I was there all night.

1067
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,450
It's the dregs until nine and then after
them I did like 20 minutes about Peter

1068
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,381
Chin about I couldn't let them.

1069
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:22,200
Hey you fuck hi ladies and gentleman.

1070
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:24,570
This is the part of the show where
Amy Schumer comes in and I get a hug.

1071
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,973
Hi Amy.

1072
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,140
We're full of Amy Schumer.

1073
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,370
Yeah,

1074
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,203
have a seat.

1075
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,943
What's up?

1076
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,093
What happened?

1077
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,611
Shit,

1078
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:42,060
I don't hear

1079
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,670
any volume anymore on who or what

1080
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,640
are you pulling it out?

1081
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,483
Your

1082
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,560
maybe you went deaf.

1083
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,591
Ooh,

1084
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:52,424
I like,

1085
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,091
that's weird.

1086
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:53,760
The died.

1087
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,920
Did you hit the buy button?

1088
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,160
You guys hear it though?

1089
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,000
Did you hit the mute button?

1090
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,491
Oh,

1091
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:58,650
that piece of shit.

1092
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,120
They send us these things,

1093
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,461
isn't there?

1094
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:07,090
Very nice.

1095
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,950
Skullcandy thank you for
sending us these things.

1096
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,900
However this fucking button sucks.

1097
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:11,734
A fat cock

1098
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,500
stupid button are cute though.

1099
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,220
Thanks.

1100
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,150
I'll sponsor like a poker player now.

1101
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:18,451
Oh,

1102
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:19,260
you think so?

1103
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,480
Let me go slow and make
us look more professional.

1104
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,210
Totally.

1105
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,531
Okay,

1106
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:23,010
good.

1107
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,741
Super Rare.

1108
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,574
Look at this.

1109
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,621
Look at this.

1110
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:26,530
You haven't been to this spot.

1111
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,060
I was going to go.

1112
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,661
When you saw the Werewolf,

1113
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:31,494
did you panic?

1114
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:31,950
Oh,

1115
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:32,970
I freaked out when I saw it.

1116
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,650
I forgot it was.

1117
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,200
There was a

1118
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,010
little warning would be cool.

1119
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,490
This is the greatest
thing that's ever existed.

1120
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,331
Really.

1121
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:43,370
There's been so much

1122
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,391
fucking Werewolf.

1123
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:49,224
I'm telling you.

1124
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,210
What a disappointment.

1125
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:52,044
Come on baby.

1126
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:52,923
You say,

1127
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,400
how long did you get
your freak on last night?

1128
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,280
What happened?

1129
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,830
I should have been drunk.

1130
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,790
Oh Shit.

1131
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,180
I was like to do a lot
of stuff and I was like,

1132
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,451
oh,

1133
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,284
it'll be funny.

1134
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,480
It'll be funny to be hungover
tomorrow having to do all this.

1135
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,280
You think it's funny to
be hung over it like shit.

1136
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,110
I just don't care about anything.

1137
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,180
That's totally like a junkie.

1138
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,350
[inaudible] yeah,

1139
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,821
you're right.

1140
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:24,654
I definitely

1141
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
skipping denial.

1142
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,040
Did you ever think that as a comic that
you can't be completely enlightened or

1143
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,030
you will stop being funny?

1144
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,510
Wait that I would never be completely

1145
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,070
like,

1146
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,480
you have to be a fuck up almost.

1147
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:45,080
She can't really completely have your
shit together or you will see cease to be

1148
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:45,950
as impulsive,

1149
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,540
hence cease to be as funny.

1150
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,110
I've no,

1151
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,350
I liked the idea that I would
ever strive to be enlightened.

1152
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:52,370
Like I just try to not kill myself,

1153
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,880
but I just try to keep
out of a depression.

1154
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,360
Maybe that was a grandiose
way of explaining it,

1155
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,040
getting out of bed in the morning.

1156
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,781
But do you,

1157
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:03,081
I mean,

1158
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:03,650
you seek,

1159
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,850
you seek personal improvement,

1160
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:05,560
right?

1161
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,470
You seek Saturday,

1162
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:07,310
you see clarity,

1163
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,460
so in,

1164
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,040
in,

1165
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,371
and that's,

1166
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:09,891
it's doing that.

1167
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:10,550
It's like,

1168
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,710
it's always the pursuit of enlightenment,

1169
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,250
but you just kind of always accept the
fact that you're never gonna get there.

1170
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,780
That's one of the reasons why people who
like claim to be enlightened or really

1171
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:21,321
pursuing it.

1172
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:21,710
Like,

1173
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:21,920
you know,

1174
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,980
Yogi style wood beads and
robes are so annoying.

1175
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,791
Cause because,

1176
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:26,301
you know,

1177
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:27,380
and I know no one's getting,

1178
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,421
it's not happening.

1179
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:28,820
Yeah.

1180
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,653
I don't think so.

1181
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,450
I don't know anything about poker so much.

1182
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,030
But,

1183
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,560
uh,

1184
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,393
I remember like,

1185
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,570
I think it was Jessica,

1186
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,540
some Jessica was playing
poker heads up and like,

1187
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,680
she obviously had been
reading the secret a ton,

1188
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:40,850
you know,

1189
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,500
and she was just like secret in it.

1190
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,790
And like it was just getting far.

1191
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,550
And then you just saw all
of a sudden she one hand,

1192
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:49,760
it was just like the secret
was gone and she lost it all.

1193
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:50,450
And it was like,

1194
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:50,871
no,

1195
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:51,291
you're not.

1196
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,580
You're like everybody else.

1197
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,021
There's no trick.

1198
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:55,160
You can't control life.

1199
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,180
We're all just going to have
to experience so much pain.

1200
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,710
What a weird notion.

1201
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,461
The secret.

1202
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:02,090
Yeah,

1203
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,930
it's really weird.

1204
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,570
It's really weird that they promoted that.

1205
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:09,080
You can just imagine that life would be
different and it would become different

1206
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,320
made essentially.

1207
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,181
That's the message.

1208
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:11,480
I mean,

1209
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,990
obviously there's more to it
than that normal talking about.

1210
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,500
I know what you say,

1211
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,750
but there's actually a
lot of good thoughts,

1212
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,810
thoughts in there?

1213
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,200
Well,

1214
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,510
there,

1215
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,540
there's some interesting ideas in there,

1216
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,880
but it's also misinterpret
quantum physics.

1217
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,790
Like the way they misinterpret the way,

1218
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,060
like the Observer.

1219
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,481
See,

1220
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,860
I saw that documentary.

1221
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,581
The first one,

1222
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:29,414
the um,

1223
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,081
the,

1224
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:30,711
the secret.

1225
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,040
And then there was another
one like through the,

1226
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,810
through the owner.

1227
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,860
The other secret.

1228
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,101
Yeah.

1229
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:34,581
Something like that.

1230
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,650
But they have this doctor

1231
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,850
a lot of secrets.

1232
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,220
His doctor quantum thing where they
show you that in measuring these quantum

1233
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:43,851
particles,

1234
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:45,770
it actually changes the
behavior of the particle.

1235
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:46,170
Yeah.

1236
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,660
Oh yeah.

1237
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,493
Cause someone is,

1238
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,370
someone is observing what's happening.

1239
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,080
But that's what it is.

1240
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,370
It's a lie.

1241
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,391
What it is,

1242
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:58,130
is the measuring of it itself changes
the reaction because you're measuring it

1243
00:33:58,131 --> 00:33:58,870
with something.

1244
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,610
Oh yes.

1245
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,520
So these quantum particles or our co,

1246
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,760
there's somehow another
measured and in measuring them,

1247
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,740
you change their behavior
because you're interfering.

1248
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,540
Measure my hangover right now.

1249
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,330
Well that makes sense.

1250
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,400
Made sense to me.

1251
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,901
Exactly.

1252
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:16,290
So all these people that feel like you
can change things by looking at them are

1253
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:17,190
just crazy.

1254
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,650
They just want to be able to
control everything like wizards.

1255
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,750
Well they love the idea
of things being managed.

1256
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:22,110
Yeah.

1257
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,411
You know,

1258
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:27,411
people love the idea of being able to
literally wish your way to a dream.

1259
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,220
Life isn't all about control.

1260
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,890
I had a photo of a house,

1261
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,370
three years living in it.

1262
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,000
Have you had to sit there conversations
like that you like from real people

1263
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:37,760
being like,

1264
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,260
oh,

1265
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,940
this is a picture of my
house I'm going to live in.

1266
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:40,540
And you're like,

1267
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,590
you're a Barista.

1268
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,800
There was a sweet girl who was so
think friends with Kelly Kirsten.

1269
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,700
She was friends with Kelly Kirsten and
she would come right Kelly Kirsten's

1270
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,870
comic or could have been
at one point in time,

1271
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,030
might have had one of the funniest
sets have ever seen in my life.

1272
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,433
Never really.

1273
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,570
It doesn't make me an orange peel back.

1274
00:34:58,571 --> 00:34:59,404
Hit the height.

1275
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,120
I thought she was going to write what
the bleep do we know that's the book.

1276
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,410
Yeah,

1277
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:02,830
that's it.

1278
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,760
That's secret number two.

1279
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:03,851
Okay.

1280
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,130
We're sort of friend comes around and um,

1281
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,700
you know,

1282
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,533
nice person,

1283
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,410
but she's like telling every,

1284
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,270
it was a weird thing.

1285
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:11,290
She wasn't bragging,

1286
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,300
but she was telling everyone like,

1287
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:13,750
what was,

1288
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,583
what was gonna Happen?

1289
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,430
You know,

1290
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,450
I ain't going to be married.

1291
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,150
I'm going to have a child and I'm
going to have a successful business.

1292
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,321
And A,

1293
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:20,890
we were like,

1294
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,230
okay,

1295
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,060
what,

1296
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,020
how's that going to happen?

1297
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,161
Uh,

1298
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:24,220
do you like you have a boyfriend?

1299
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:24,461
She goes,

1300
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:24,880
no,

1301
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,880
I have just seen the secret and I have
decided to live my life through its

1302
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:32,590
principles and it totally works.

1303
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:33,424
It's amazing.

1304
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:33,971
And I go,

1305
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:34,331
really?

1306
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:34,900
She goes,

1307
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,350
already,

1308
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,850
I feel my life getting better.

1309
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,760
I feel I'm definitely moving
in the right direction.

1310
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,810
All this is going to happen.

1311
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:41,950
I'm completely clear,

1312
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:43,600
so I'm ready for a healthy relationship.

1313
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,640
When you're ready for
a healthy relationship,

1314
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:46,570
that's when it finds you.

1315
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,910
And so she's saying all this stuff.

1316
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,430
I'm like,

1317
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:48,731
wow.

1318
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:49,061
All right.

1319
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:49,840
That's really cool.

1320
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,231
All right.

1321
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:50,861
It was a really weird,

1322
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:51,550
she was very nice.

1323
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,380
So it wasn't a negative
conversation at all.

1324
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,880
So then I don't see her.

1325
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:55,840
Um,

1326
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,150
we,

1327
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,300
I,

1328
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,560
I,

1329
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,730
the last I spoke to her
in that conversation,

1330
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,620
then I don't see her again until like
maybe a year and a half later she comes to

1331
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:06,040
the UCB and I'm doing a set of the UCB.

1332
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,750
So she comes by and I'm like,

1333
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:08,051
hey,

1334
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:08,900
how you doing?

1335
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:09,221
And she goes,

1336
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:10,270
we came to see your sat.

1337
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:11,170
And this now I go,

1338
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,800
I go,

1339
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,561
oh yeah,

1340
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:12,761
I go,

1341
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:13,360
thanks for coming.

1342
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,930
I go,

1343
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:14,990
last time I talked to you,

1344
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,240
you were like really into the secret,

1345
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,074
like what's going on?

1346
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,891
And she goes,

1347
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:18,161
I go,

1348
00:36:18,161 --> 00:36:19,490
I would love to hear like you progress.

1349
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:20,324
Just like,

1350
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,110
I don't know why it's not working.

1351
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,521
Oh Man,

1352
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,760
I really thought you were
going to say it like Cancun.

1353
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,870
Paul out of my life that I want out of
my life and my father got sick and I know

1354
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:34,720
I didn't ask for that because
you can't control the world.

1355
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,290
It's like,

1356
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:35,950
yeah,

1357
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,360
you're not getting sick has
something to do with you.

1358
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,380
But it was fascinating because like
in the text of my life it was like,

1359
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,200
you know how like people
that come in now your life,

1360
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,700
well not seeing this person like meaner,

1361
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,560
having this conversation with her and
then seeing her a year and a half plus

1362
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:51,520
whatever it was later.

1363
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:52,570
And then here's the results.

1364
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,790
It was like I get to like
splice the two of them together

1365
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,200
and we got to hear it,

1366
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,520
but not even have to have a
conversation without worrying.

1367
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,540
She like a lot of people
that are really into,

1368
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,500
that gets sucked into cults and a lot
of people that get sucked into religions

1369
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,630
or yoga or whatever,

1370
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,730
people they get,

1371
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:16,680
like some people like need something to
excite them to believe in some new piece

1372
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:17,514
of information.

1373
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,820
How this amazing I did all my life.

1374
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,910
I've been living without knowledge
that I am in control of my destiny.

1375
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:29,880
I create my universe.

1376
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,211
God,

1377
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,700
you just want to tell the people
that I've heard you before.

1378
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,440
I've heard people exactly like you before.

1379
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:35,820
I'm sorry if I'm not going to get into it.

1380
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,370
Yeah,

1381
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:36,810
yeah,

1382
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,880
but he can't be even rude if you

1383
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,200
you do that.

1384
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,360
Right?

1385
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,500
It's annoying when people,

1386
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,850
they,

1387
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,200
when they find something that they're,

1388
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,620
they look at you like you're you,

1389
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,440
you don't get it,

1390
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,630
then you will or,

1391
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,910
or they feel bad for you.

1392
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,070
Is everybody all that kind
of like smirk like you're,

1393
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:53,090
you're still where you are,

1394
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:54,020
but yeah,

1395
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,840
I was doing this,

1396
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,521
the meeting.

1397
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,980
You should come like that and you're like,

1398
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,311
no,

1399
00:37:58,311 --> 00:37:58,910
that's cool.

1400
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,710
Have Fun.

1401
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,710
I was doing this thing for VH one and a,

1402
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:04,720
there's a girl who's working
there seemed so nice.

1403
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:07,900
She seems so like normal
and friendly and uh,

1404
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,650
her sister was such a,

1405
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,070
like a,

1406
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,500
a religious freak that she,

1407
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,250
she was actually the first person that
I've ever met in my life who believed in

1408
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,490
Satan and she was telling me that
the reason why I can't see Satan,

1409
00:38:18,491 --> 00:38:21,580
the saint and scales were
over my eye and yeah.

1410
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,650
Okay.

1411
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,640
But you really have sessions for people.

1412
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,091
Well,

1413
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:25,241
I'm,

1414
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:26,074
I'm fascinated.

1415
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,790
He's,

1416
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm fascinated by people.

1417
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:31,290
If I get a chance to talk to someone
that actually is like that nutty.

1418
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,860
Yeah.

1419
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,251
But she,

1420
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:32,731
it was funny.

1421
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:34,350
It's like I feel bad for you.

1422
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:35,184
For Real.

1423
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,090
I feel bad

1424
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:36,391
for you.

1425
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:36,751
For Real.

1426
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:37,620
You don't believe that?

1427
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,540
Wow.

1428
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,800
Can't believe you don't believe that.

1429
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,700
It was so strange cause I was like totally
like dead facing the whole thing as

1430
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,910
if I was like watching like a show I like,

1431
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,520
Huh.

1432
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:47,671
Yeah.

1433
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:50,610
It just looks like serving
her because in her mind,

1434
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,650
by making me feel bad,

1435
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:52,830
like,

1436
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,090
like,

1437
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,740
like whenever anybody laughs at you or
they're trying to make you feel bad,

1438
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,360
like,

1439
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,193
oh,

1440
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,733
why are they doing?

1441
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,753
They're trying to,

1442
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,160
they're socially wrestling,

1443
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,150
you're socially wrestling,

1444
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:03,990
they try and take you down.

1445
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,590
Right.

1446
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,300
And whenever someone does that,

1447
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:09,570
it's like at that only works if
you don't know what it is like.

1448
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:10,830
So as soon as you know what it is,

1449
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,660
then it's just silly.

1450
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,070
It's just like a social cue.

1451
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:13,904
It's like,

1452
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,280
it's like just the most infuriating thing.

1453
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,840
And that's also their way of saying,

1454
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,280
and I don't think you
know what this means.

1455
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:19,760
Yeah.

1456
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,593
Yeah.

1457
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,290
God,

1458
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:21,440
it's,

1459
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,000
that really pisses me off.

1460
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,181
Oh,

1461
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:24,890
it's one of the grossest things ever,

1462
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,311
you know?

1463
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:25,511
And,

1464
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:25,960
and,

1465
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,540
and people that pretend that
they have secret information,

1466
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,171
you know,

1467
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:30,351
you're,

1468
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,280
you're pretending what?

1469
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,450
You've got some secrets.

1470
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,130
Can you think of this one MC on the road,

1471
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,850
those working with youth?

1472
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:35,980
No,

1473
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,710
he's a feature and he would,

1474
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:38,100
um,

1475
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,850
and you would come out and he would like
take his time and bring his coffee on

1476
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:43,050
stage with him before
he would go before me.

1477
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,751
But per tenant,

1478
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:44,340
you'd be like,

1479
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,080
he'd lay low in the
stool and he'd be like,

1480
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:46,890
so a woo.

1481
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,730
Where are you from?

1482
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,711
You know,

1483
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:50,130
like he's working the
crowd and I'm just like,

1484
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:50,761
dude,

1485
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:51,210
come on.

1486
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,320
And he'd come and he'd be like,

1487
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,283
uh,

1488
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,300
come to me and be like,

1489
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,171
you'll,

1490
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:56,070
you'll enjoy them.

1491
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,503
And I'm like,

1492
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,340
how to hear?

1493
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,640
Uh,

1494
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,231
well,

1495
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:02,430
I think it's gross.

1496
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,570
It's gotta be gross.

1497
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,500
You to have like these douchey guys
that trip on the fact that you're

1498
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,190
headlining.

1499
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,590
They're all,

1500
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:08,971
they all,

1501
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,410
everyone thinks that they
should be headlining.

1502
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:12,300
They're so annoyed that that I am,

1503
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,740
and I just explained,

1504
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,191
I'm just like,

1505
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:14,700
okay.

1506
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:14,911
Yeah.

1507
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:15,241
I'm like,

1508
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:15,511
God,

1509
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:16,440
you should be headlining.

1510
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,620
Like,

1511
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,890
I'll just do it for the ride.

1512
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,770
Yeah.

1513
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,603
Do you want to go back?

1514
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,700
Do you want me to bring you back up?

1515
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,283
I'll bring you back.

1516
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,710
Huh?

1517
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,140
Why don't you just bring
your own people on the road?

1518
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,340
No,

1519
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:26,620
no,

1520
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,401
I do that guy.

1521
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:29,320
I learned my lesson because I
kept getting paired with him.

1522
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:29,960
Like I,

1523
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,330
I chose Virginia and be like,

1524
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,733
oh,

1525
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,391
but you know,

1526
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:34,910
you try to,

1527
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,840
you try to bring your own person early
in the game and they're just like,

1528
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,590
no,

1529
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,970
here's your thousand dollars for eight
shows and we're pairing you with the club

1530
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:44,350
owners nephew.

1531
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,090
That's done it twice.

1532
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,080
He's going to do 30.

1533
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,890
I've never had a road
acts either one of you.

1534
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,030
They tried to sabotage you.

1535
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,320
Uh,

1536
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,153
I think every,

1537
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,533
everybody,

1538
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,440
everybody goes up before you
is essentially just try it.

1539
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,370
It's a complex plot to sabotage.

1540
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,170
You

1541
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:01,560
ruined.

1542
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,230
They all got together in the guy,

1543
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,430
that guy and then people who will
go up the way they bring you up.

1544
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,900
If somebody wants to sabotage me,

1545
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,580
the most aggressive move is to say,

1546
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,290
I hope you guys are ready,

1547
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,330
Fara lady

1548
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,270
trying to sabotage it or just not.

1549
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:17,931
By the way,

1550
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:20,360
if I ever bring you up now you know

1551
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,810
the show just so you can,

1552
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,480
if I ever area in a
position to bring you up.

1553
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,370
All right,

1554
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,203
so

1555
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,230
lady

1556
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,730
who likes ovaries and
the crowd just prepares,

1557
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,300
you know,

1558
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,030
the board and to go to the
bathroom and it's just so mean.

1559
00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:40,140
And when a lot of times,

1560
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:40,891
you know,

1561
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:44,280
even sometimes the girls will
do it like this next girl,

1562
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,290
she is a funny woman.

1563
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:46,921
Just all the words,

1564
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,670
the trigger words for people that make it

1565
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,650
upset and angry with
you before you even set,

1566
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,543
right?

1567
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,980
Yeah.

1568
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,870
Is it just a sign that
they're not accepting you,

1569
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,310
treating you differently?

1570
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,711
Yeah.

1571
00:41:58,711 --> 00:41:58,981
They're all,

1572
00:41:58,981 --> 00:41:59,880
they're trying to be,

1573
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:00,450
you know,

1574
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,040
they're trying to passive aggressive.

1575
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,531
Yeah.

1576
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:03,700
Well that's how you're taking it.

1577
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:06,700
I think also they feel like some dudes
just don't know what the fuck they're

1578
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:07,230
saying.

1579
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:07,470
Yeah.

1580
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,460
Just stammering up there low.

1581
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,303
Okay.

1582
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,240
Think it's aggressive.

1583
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,290
If a girl does it,

1584
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,040
it's aggressive because she knows.

1585
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,550
She knows.

1586
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,470
But then you'll let
people go on after you,

1587
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:21,681
you know,

1588
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:22,120
when you,

1589
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,790
you'll like come up the MC and maybe
it's someone you know and you'll make a

1590
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:26,601
joke about them.

1591
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:26,871
You know,

1592
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:27,530
you'll be like,

1593
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:27,990
all right,

1594
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,270
a great try if I can,

1595
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:29,661
whatever.

1596
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:30,494
It just has it.

1597
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,470
And then you do your whole hour and
then they come back up and they make

1598
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,300
reference to what you said an hour ago.

1599
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,150
And you're like,

1600
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,010
you've been thinking about
saying that for an hour.

1601
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,893
Yeah.

1602
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,443
I don't know.

1603
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,090
Uh,

1604
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,680
my best friends are female comics,

1605
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:50,030
so I don't know.

1606
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:50,864
I mean,

1607
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:51,910
I mean,

1608
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:52,100
oh,

1609
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,933
you know what it is,

1610
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:53,960
um,

1611
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,651
real competitive,

1612
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:58,760
like in a spa locker room
or the gym locker room,

1613
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,470
there's just this,

1614
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,120
there's something in the air,

1615
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,910
like we're all ready to
fucking kill each other.

1616
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,663
It's true.

1617
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't know why that is.

1618
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,060
And then the spa or,

1619
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:11,241
you know,

1620
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:11,631
but you know what,

1621
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:12,200
at the,

1622
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,300
where I box in New York,

1623
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:17,691
we're all like,

1624
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:20,570
sort of trying to like get
ready after we worked out and,

1625
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,570
but then there was like
this one big black check,

1626
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,270
this other like skinny white chick.

1627
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,231
And we were,

1628
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:27,840
yeah.

1629
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,171
And uh,

1630
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:30,460
and she was just annoying
and she was on her phone.

1631
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,431
So anyway,

1632
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:32,660
she leaves and then I'm like,

1633
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,291
you know,

1634
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,940
trying to bond with the black chick.

1635
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:35,960
Like we all try and do

1636
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:38,570
it.

1637
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:39,410
I'm just like,

1638
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,281
I'm like God,

1639
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:40,881
that girl.

1640
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:41,211
Right.

1641
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:41,870
And she's like,

1642
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,081
oh,

1643
00:43:42,081 --> 00:43:42,950
I didn't mind her.

1644
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,790
And I'm like,

1645
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,623
Shit.

1646
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,050
Yeah.

1647
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,261
I'm like,

1648
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:45,711
come on.

1649
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:46,544
And then she goes,

1650
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,950
yeah she sorta like came around,

1651
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:49,401
but I was like,

1652
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:49,761
you know,

1653
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:52,070
that girl was the worst so I'll reach out,

1654
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:52,731
you know,

1655
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:53,370
in the locker.

1656
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,440
But there's just like,

1657
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,350
there's just something in the
air where you're just like,

1658
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,450
but yeah,

1659
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,270
I don't know what it all girls or to
try to improve themselves as well.

1660
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:05,920
It's like a self improvement place
cause it's a gym is a soft fruit jam.

1661
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:06,071
Yeah.

1662
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:06,491
But you know,

1663
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:07,241
girls that go there,

1664
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:07,590
they're like,

1665
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,150
they're trying to,

1666
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,580
I'm trying to get my anger out.

1667
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,010
I'm trying to get some stuff out.

1668
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,580
Maybe it's that one.

1669
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,880
It's a little tension and
aggressive environment.

1670
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:16,961
It's all women.

1671
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:17,794
A spa,

1672
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,233
relax,

1673
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,570
relax.

1674
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,350
That makes more sense than a boxing gym
because you're going to get naturally

1675
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:27,220
get aggressive women I think at a
boxing gym or a high percentage of them,

1676
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:28,720
like a boxing gym for men.

1677
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:29,801
Like for MS,

1678
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:30,340
more aggressive,

1679
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,173
high MMA.

1680
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:31,641
They,

1681
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:31,910
they,

1682
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:32,140
there's

1683
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,870
some aggressive people there,

1684
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,050
but for the most part,

1685
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:35,470
no.

1686
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,630
Most part people chill
out because they train.

1687
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,573
Yeah.

1688
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,740
When you train a lot you,

1689
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:42,460
you get all your animosity
and anger out that way.

1690
00:44:42,461 --> 00:44:45,370
It's like the people that are actually
like some of the nicest people I know are

1691
00:44:45,371 --> 00:44:46,181
martial artists.

1692
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:46,930
Totally.

1693
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:47,500
Yeah.

1694
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:47,681
Yeah.

1695
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:48,970
The guys who I know that,

1696
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,050
but chickson a spa.

1697
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,913
That's weird.

1698
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,040
There's just some were even like in an
elevator and you can smell each other's

1699
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:56,510
vaginas,

1700
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,710
so it is it just you?

1701
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,660
I don't think that's it.

1702
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,770
Elevated our re dogs.

1703
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,690
What is that?

1704
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,640
I want to be the only
pussy smell in the room.

1705
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,960
Are you say that,

1706
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:11,840
but the reason why you guys have
coinciding menstrual cycles is pheromonal.

1707
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:12,181
Yeah.

1708
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:13,014
What's that?

1709
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:13,430
Yeah.

1710
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,440
What that is going to be like.

1711
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,880
You've never talked to her

1712
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,170
toes colored pills.

1713
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,540
That's ridiculous.

1714
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:28,830
That's not what your nails look like.

1715
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,680
Oh my God.

1716
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,791
Yeah.

1717
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:33,380
I don't know.

1718
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,320
Just pheromonal though.

1719
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:34,880
Hormonal.

1720
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:34,960
I

1721
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,230
think it's a chemical thing.

1722
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:36,880
Yeah.

1723
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,190
The,

1724
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,490
the,

1725
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,460
the hate that women have for
each other is hormonal chip.

1726
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:41,840
Bummer.

1727
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,770
But my best friends,

1728
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,550
honestly,

1729
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,560
my favorite people to be
around her are female comics.

1730
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:46,161
What about us?

1731
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:46,994
Bitch,

1732
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,980
I really take it or
leave it with you guys.

1733
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,180
So rude,

1734
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:51,800
but true by you as well.

1735
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,510
And the cords wrapped you up.

1736
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,523
Something's going on here.

1737
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,101
I don't know.

1738
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:55,934
It's hard.

1739
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,013
You don't know what you're doing.

1740
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,580
My first time in it.

1741
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,830
Maybe help Jamie run in
and take care of you.

1742
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,150
Just climb of there and
got an assistant finger.

1743
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,490
Their son assistant.

1744
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,230
Yeah.

1745
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,170
It's don't lie to him.

1746
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:08,290
Works for you guys.

1747
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,500
He's the guys are saying,

1748
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,880
is that a,

1749
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,370
is that a derogatory
term to say an assistant?

1750
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,070
Um,

1751
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:14,903
I don't know.

1752
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,920
You feel slighted?

1753
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,790
This is what I think.

1754
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:19,580
I think people shouldn't have labels.

1755
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,590
They were going to call him red band.

1756
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,793
Do work.

1757
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,101
Okay.

1758
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:24,080
Let's never label anyone anymore.

1759
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:24,440
No.

1760
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,220
People like,

1761
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,330
like working in a place.

1762
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:26,751
What are you doing?

1763
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,040
This guy's just a worker guy.

1764
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:28,911
Just doing his shit.

1765
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,750
We're all working together.

1766
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,561
President.

1767
00:46:30,561 --> 00:46:31,311
The guide.

1768
00:46:31,311 --> 00:46:34,340
Starting the [inaudible] here
at the Joe Rogan experience.

1769
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,870
Enterprise.

1770
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:35,810
You don't see color?

1771
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,710
I don't see detail.

1772
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:40,230
Your car.

1773
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,063
Okay,

1774
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:42,710
Darya.

1775
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:43,311
Hey Jamie.

1776
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:45,310
I'll have a skim.

1777
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,070
Listen,

1778
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,480
you're the one who I had to go
through five fucking [inaudible].

1779
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:49,563
You're going to do this.

1780
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,820
I knew I knew it.

1781
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:52,791
Yeah.

1782
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,061
Look,

1783
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:53,960
I know you're busy.

1784
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,880
I knew it was really hard and
she figured out and she's like,

1785
00:46:59,130 --> 00:46:59,390
um,

1786
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,721
she's like,

1787
00:46:59,721 --> 00:47:00,261
just give me,

1788
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:00,531
I'm like,

1789
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:00,771
no,

1790
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:01,670
you don't understand.

1791
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:02,840
It's not going to be okay.

1792
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:03,561
And she's like,

1793
00:47:03,561 --> 00:47:04,221
it'll be fine.

1794
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:04,360
What?

1795
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,193
She wanted my number.

1796
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:05,991
Yeah.

1797
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:06,471
I was just like,

1798
00:47:06,471 --> 00:47:07,060
no I can't.

1799
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,230
Yeah.

1800
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,320
Well publicists are for
the most part annoying.

1801
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,520
Twats cause most of them
are a really brutal,

1802
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,660
I missed the word Twat.

1803
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:14,870
Yeah,

1804
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,370
it's good to hear it anymore.

1805
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:21,020
But my publicist is actually a really
cool guy and my last publicist is actually

1806
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:21,510
a very cold,

1807
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:21,720
no,

1808
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,610
I don't like labels.

1809
00:47:22,611 --> 00:47:24,700
I just called my publicist like twice.

1810
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah.

1811
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,833
Twice.

1812
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,250
Twice.

1813
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:27,721
Get me an ass.

1814
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:29,000
Where am I supposed to go at 10.

1815
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:29,820
Hey,

1816
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,270
twice daily show.

1817
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:33,760
Come on and watch.

1818
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,390
Set it up.

1819
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,680
Is this not the daily show?

1820
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,613
Not Anymore.

1821
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,180
Oh,

1822
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,541
really?

1823
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:38,710
Hung over shit.

1824
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,573
I am,

1825
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:42,783
uh,

1826
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,803
uh,

1827
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,550
I don't drink much,

1828
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:46,863
but I will drink.

1829
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,310
I don't drink every day.

1830
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,120
That's what you're saying.

1831
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,990
Is that how you're rocking it?

1832
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,190
No,

1833
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,761
I can't.

1834
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:55,090
I have to like schedule when
I can drink Jack Daniels.

1835
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:56,500
Or are you just an beer or,

1836
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,610
I do like,

1837
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,940
like the feeling of being a little buzzed.

1838
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,020
Just so bad for your body though.

1839
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,820
I hadn't drank before last night for a
while because I was getting ready for

1840
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,063
Shit.

1841
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,773
Getting Ready,

1842
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,890
getting ready to shut your show.

1843
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,170
It was on comedy central when tonight.

1844
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,093
What's it called?

1845
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,600
Inside Amy Schumer.

1846
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:32,951
Amy Schumer.

1847
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,600
But that was already used by someone else.

1848
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,640
I want it to be called come
inside with Amy Schumer,

1849
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,120
but comedy central.

1850
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,720
Liz Phair song,

1851
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,550
hot white.

1852
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,990
It's like one of the greatest songs ever.

1853
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,700
There's nothing wrong with an ode to come.

1854
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,320
What are you talking about?

1855
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:54,730
Yeah,

1856
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,240
it is.

1857
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,021
It's fucking great.

1858
00:48:56,021 --> 00:48:56,854
It's a great song.

1859
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,380
Really never heard it.

1860
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,350
These are blurred out.

1861
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,340
Was it really [inaudible]
out of a gang bang

1862
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,330
and I'm like,

1863
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:14,531
wait,

1864
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:16,560
why are you so cool with believing

1865
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,720
what Whitney

1866
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,451
was telling me?

1867
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:24,700
Some of this stuff that you
guys wrote together and stuff.

1868
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:25,600
He was,

1869
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:25,900
yeah,

1870
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,381
he's awesome.

1871
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,940
But he was saying how
you have a really good,

1872
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:28,490
uh,

1873
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:29,140
uh,

1874
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,450
being able to like fuck with yourself.

1875
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:31,650
Oh yeah.

1876
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,683
Oh yeah.

1877
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:37,743
He's like a,

1878
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,120
he's like,

1879
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,270
you're just not my type.

1880
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,780
And then this guy tells me he
has aids on her third date.

1881
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,321
Are you,

1882
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:45,010
uh,

1883
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,300
are you enjoying the process?

1884
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:48,460
Like tell us what's making a show.

1885
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,070
It was so much work

1886
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,023
being a comic.

1887
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,110
I thought that was a lot of work.

1888
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,220
This is like ridiculous fucking
difference if you get another season.

1889
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:00,700
And I'm like,

1890
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,170
uh,

1891
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,860
when I slit my wrists I'm like,

1892
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:04,030
I'm so tired.

1893
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,410
Or would you rather just do stand up?

1894
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:08,803
I mean,

1895
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,753
I don't know.

1896
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,550
Does that work?

1897
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,383
That much work?

1898
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,390
It is a lot of work to do a show.

1899
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,610
I like really like the
show we made though.

1900
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,260
But it's so much fun to just to stand up,

1901
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:18,094
isn't it?

1902
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,420
It's your own show though.

1903
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,850
I'm proud of this shit.

1904
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,540
That's awesome.

1905
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,950
But I just feel like I
have nothing left in me.

1906
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,280
I'm like,

1907
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,770
all right,

1908
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,800
well well isn't that why you do a,

1909
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:27,441
so you know,

1910
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:27,801
you do.

1911
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:27,951
I'm,

1912
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:30,740
and then you take some time
off and go to The Bahamas.

1913
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,750
Can you picture taken
by in your underwear?

1914
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,200
Oops.

1915
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,150
I didn't know the photographer
that I paid was there.

1916
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,490
Why am I in my underwear in the cause.

1917
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,600
You want to get some press?

1918
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,430
That would not be smart for me,

1919
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,280
Dude.

1920
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,710
Bro,

1921
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,770
you're so wrong.

1922
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,061
Listen,

1923
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:47,450
you need to what Tyler Durden do and
I just have like my leg over my head

1924
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,080
in front of your iPhone.

1925
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,910
A couple fingers.

1926
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,420
Just do a vine myself.

1927
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,010
Like a bowling ball on this yourself.

1928
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,750
Like with the camera right there.

1929
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:01,700
I really don't think that that would,

1930
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:02,690
I think that would help me.

1931
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,553
It would help you.

1932
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,533
That would help me.

1933
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,421
You're a comic.

1934
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:06,254
You're not some failure.

1935
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,850
Some chick that's on the view.

1936
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:08,943
Our Chelsea,

1937
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,010
I've been,

1938
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,020
I just guest hosted the VA out of duty.

1939
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,893
Are you serious?

1940
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:15,883
That's hilarious.

1941
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,510
Is that crazy?

1942
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:20,970
A white lady still on fucking
wants to stockpile ammo.

1943
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,853
I'm just kidding.

1944
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,220
What's her name?

1945
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,190
The pretty blonde lady.

1946
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:25,580
Yeah,

1947
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,690
she's hilarious.

1948
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,810
I love how she yells when
she's in an argument.

1949
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:30,644
That's the best part.

1950
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,900
She yells ports angry.

1951
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,990
She just yells or point.

1952
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,550
I wonder if they're booking me more now
and wonder if I'll ever get into it with

1953
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,190
anyone.

1954
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:38,530
I mean,

1955
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,650
I just want to do a good job.

1956
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,390
Listen,

1957
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,400
you haven't gotten into it
without Elizabeth Chick yet?

1958
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,120
No.

1959
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,300
Are you being nice or something?

1960
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,741
Come on.

1961
00:51:48,741 --> 00:51:51,630
She's must've said something that
makes you want to like go whoop.

1962
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,311
No,

1963
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:57,200
I agree with all of her views and I have
the same views including your fears are

1964
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,034
Mexicans,

1965
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,460
Mexicans,

1966
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,731
Mexicans.

1967
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:03,300
What are the ones who
live in Miami called?

1968
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,860
Those are the best Mexicans.

1969
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,370
I don't really like any other ones.

1970
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,133
God,

1971
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,973
listen,

1972
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,780
this place feels like Mexico.

1973
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,280
This spot we're at.

1974
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,370
Just like the decorations like Mexico.

1975
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:17,810
Where the fuck you been in Mexico?

1976
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,513
Walls.

1977
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,910
Dead animal skulls.

1978
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,050
This is like home.

1979
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,850
This is like spring break.

1980
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,650
This is where I stay in Cancun.

1981
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,310
Did you see that video
on the Mexican drug?

1982
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:32,570
Lord cutting his girlfriend set off.

1983
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,220
Oh,

1984
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,500
it was on.

1985
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,333
Showed it.

1986
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,650
It show the cutting it off.

1987
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:36,300
Yeah,

1988
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,040
with a knife.

1989
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,873
It was on youtube.

1990
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,540
He got pulled off.

1991
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:38,960
I think still.

1992
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,480
I'm like,

1993
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,580
why they pull it off?

1994
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:41,020
No,

1995
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,250
no,

1996
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,083
no.

1997
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,413
I don't want to watch it.

1998
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,930
It's super graphic.

1999
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:45,831
Yeah.

2000
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:47,780
He holds her head up to
the camera and everything.

2001
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,080
My point is Mexico is fucking crazy.

2002
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,520
It is not going to Mexico.

2003
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,061
Do you ever watch,

2004
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:57,650
I survived where they kidnapped the
guy in Mexico and they keep him,

2005
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,900
hold him for ransom.

2006
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:00,734
Is that as a

2007
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,200
year?

2008
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,810
And they just make them like they shoot
him and they just make him sit in his

2009
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:09,020
own piss and shit and they'd
sleep deprivation is the thing.

2010
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,603
Woo.

2011
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,110
They play that loud music.

2012
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,273
Oh my God.

2013
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:14,120
Yeah.

2014
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,080
You don't want your kid to have to,

2015
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:18,470
Mexico really must hurt tourism.

2016
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:19,590
Just the lid on.

2017
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,113
It's like,

2018
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:22,521
oh,

2019
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:23,354
but you might die.

2020
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,223
You might not live.

2021
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,030
Yeah.

2022
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,331
I mean,

2023
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:26,020
people don't want

2024
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:26,950
to go to Afghanistan.

2025
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,281
Okay,

2026
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:28,114
look at it this way.

2027
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,450
Yeah.

2028
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:28,631
It all,

2029
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:28,920
I can't,

2030
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,010
I don't want to go to Afghanistan.

2031
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:35,220
You're way more likely to get shot in
Mexico than you are in Afghanistan.

2032
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,480
The amount of American troops that have
died in Afghanistan is not nearly the

2033
00:53:40,481 --> 00:53:43,210
number of people that have been
killed in the drug war in Mexico.

2034
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:44,140
Really?

2035
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:44,890
Oh yeah,

2036
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,000
it's way more.

2037
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:46,691
It's way more.

2038
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:49,090
It's like 10 times more
or something crazy.

2039
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:49,331
Yeah.

2040
00:53:49,331 --> 00:53:51,540
And nobody's like taking
Christmas to go to,

2041
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,800
if you're partying in Juarez,

2042
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:54,850
you fucked up.

2043
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,140
That sounds like a guy.

2044
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,360
Give your down having it
Amy Schumer away in Juarez.

2045
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:03,330
That dude will fucking bug out

2046
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,993
being vantage.

2047
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,910
There's gotta be some sort of a solution,

2048
00:54:10,911 --> 00:54:12,200
but I don't know what the
fuck it's going to be.

2049
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:12,990
You know,

2050
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:13,160
like,

2051
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,340
let's just never go to Mexico.

2052
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:14,511
Well,

2053
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:15,140
it's like,

2054
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,640
there's been times in
human history where w,

2055
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,051
you know,

2056
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:21,770
civilizations crumbled and
we're essentially watching
that happen in Mexico.

2057
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,800
We're watching our neighbor [inaudible]
humbling roiled in this ridiculous war

2058
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:31,640
where the drug dealers have billions of
dollars in tanks and fucking weapons and

2059
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:32,090
shit,

2060
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,130
and they hire mercenaries
to come over there.

2061
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,390
Is it mostly the border towns?

2062
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,230
Yes.

2063
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,590
Yeah,

2064
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:36,981
it's good.

2065
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:38,350
It's all quarterly lane.

2066
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,501
I don't know where,

2067
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:40,210
you know,

2068
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,630
they killed a bunch of
people in Aqua Polo,

2069
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:41,991
Carl,

2070
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:44,840
so I don't think there's a photo in a,

2071
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,920
in a fucking resort.

2072
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,930
They wonder a resort and
killed a bunch of foreigners.

2073
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:48,860
Ah,

2074
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,693
yeah.

2075
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,440
Yeah.

2076
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,210
Poor really bad.

2077
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:52,541
Oh,

2078
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:53,340
it's bad.

2079
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,130
They're touching the way
it was actually no from

2080
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:56,930
Bain.

2081
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,390
There were still silly
enough to go to acapulco.

2082
00:54:59,630 --> 00:54:59,930
Well,

2083
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,291
you know,

2084
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:02,060
they deserve it using this Lillian lists.

2085
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,440
That's just unacceptable.

2086
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:04,340
I don't know what happened.

2087
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,330
I don't know who it was.

2088
00:55:05,331 --> 00:55:06,410
I don't know what the story was,

2089
00:55:06,411 --> 00:55:07,131
but I know that it's,

2090
00:55:07,131 --> 00:55:07,431
you know,

2091
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:07,621
the,

2092
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:08,630
especially the border towns,

2093
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:10,070
they're incredibly dangerous.

2094
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,993
Yeah.

2095
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:15,110
I mean it's just people going down left
and right and getting know headless

2096
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:15,940
fucking body

2097
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,440
and it's not like it was safe before.

2098
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,250
No,

2099
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,200
no safe place.

2100
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,500
Yeah.

2101
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,940
It's interesting when a culture like
drastically changes over a fairly short

2102
00:55:24,941 --> 00:55:25,570
period of time.

2103
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:29,910
I used to go to Mexico and we just go
straight to the spring break thing on TV

2104
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,050
in like the late nineties you know,

2105
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:33,190
maybe like name names,

2106
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:36,220
like maybe even the early two
thousands it was like no big deal.

2107
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:36,560
Yeah.

2108
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,050
What was it like the grind.

2109
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,161
The grind.

2110
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:39,420
Yeah.

2111
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,930
Maybe you and Eric were on the ground.

2112
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:44,460
I remember we used to get
our pump on you this week.

2113
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,940
Told me how to shave my chest.

2114
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,110
I believe all of this.

2115
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:48,123
Sure.

2116
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:49,450
Yeah.

2117
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,283
Were dance partners.

2118
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,710
We're going to be the first gay
couple on dances with the stars.

2119
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,990
You guys fuck each other?

2120
00:55:55,991 --> 00:55:56,980
Just to be honest with you.

2121
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:57,903
For how long?

2122
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:58,571
For how long?

2123
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:01,360
Like an hour or I could watch
that longer than the head cutting.

2124
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,020
What'd you write?

2125
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:03,781
You Watch two guys.

2126
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:04,470
Fuck.

2127
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,120
Easier than it had never seen two guys.

2128
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:06,690
Fuck.

2129
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,523
Yeah,

2130
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,970
I find that hard to believe why mean
in real life or on the Internet.

2131
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:13,560
I've never even watched
it on the Internet.

2132
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,700
Pull it up for Brian.

2133
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,590
I'm not,

2134
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:16,300
I'm not.

2135
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,133
All right.

2136
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,820
That was hard to convince me.

2137
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,840
No.

2138
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,673
Okay.

2139
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,041
Brian,

2140
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,030
the only way this is gonna work.

2141
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,220
Take the monitor

2142
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,090
and um,

2143
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,080
don't scream.

2144
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,610
Don't scream the show.

2145
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,440
And then on that screen over there,

2146
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,660
you need to show two guys
fucking just for Amy.

2147
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,500
So well,

2148
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,101
it will never show.

2149
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:33,521
You can do that,

2150
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:33,920
right?

2151
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,270
The guys,

2152
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,700
I want it to be fine.

2153
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,563
He's going to find that

2154
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,860
mix has to flesh best to flesh.

2155
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:43,120
I actually invented that name.

2156
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,100
The guy's name is flash
mixed master six master flesh

2157
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,073
by accident.

2158
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:51,310
Yeah,

2159
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:51,940
right.

2160
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,550
Just fucks everybody
who shows up and slings.

2161
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:54,910
Dick,

2162
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,590
my name is cheese cream.

2163
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,930
Can I get a rap name?

2164
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:02,531
Well,

2165
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:03,364
my rap name be.

2166
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,930
I always felt like if we're
going to have a nickname,

2167
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:06,160
can't really nickname yourself.

2168
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,760
Knowing someone tried to
push their own nickname,

2169
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,850
they introduce you as their nicknames.

2170
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,013
Fuck

2171
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:15,300
my volleyball team.

2172
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:18,310
It didn't really catch on shrooms the for

2173
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,900
made your own nickname up.

2174
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:24,070
It means you have no friends.

2175
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,180
That's the only thing it means.

2176
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,170
Yeah,

2177
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:29,820
it doesn't make any sense other
than that crazy pub Fred's person.

2178
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,640
Hey guys,

2179
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,050
I'm going to be t rex.

2180
00:57:32,051 --> 00:57:32,321
You know,

2181
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:33,790
cause I'm always talking like this.

2182
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:36,383
Yeah,

2183
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:38,650
fighters.

2184
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,341
It's hilarious.

2185
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:41,500
Fighters come up with some
of the silliest nickname.

2186
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,730
They have to stick with it

2187
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:46,330
and it's there forever.

2188
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,500
Change like a Rory Macdonald,

2189
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,520
he used to call himself the water
boy and then he changed his to Aries,

2190
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,211
Aries,

2191
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:56,170
God of war.

2192
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:01,150
That's kind of interesting where you're
allowed to change your name change,

2193
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:06,070
but now I feel more like the god of war,

2194
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:11,483
the world,

2195
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,570
the god of war.

2196
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,490
It relates to like Mexico crumbling.

2197
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,510
I'm reading this.

2198
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:24,670
I'm listening rather to this podcast
that explains what the fuck is wrong with

2199
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,510
the Middle East.

2200
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:29,770
One of the reasons why the Middle
East is so backwards and fucked up.

2201
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,940
His Gingiss Khan,

2202
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,200
Genghis Khan rolled through
there in 1200 something.

2203
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:35,770
It wasn't gangs.

2204
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:40,270
It was actually his sons because he
was already dead and crushed Baghdad

2205
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:41,104
killing.

2206
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,500
They might've killed a million people.

2207
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,260
Is that people fucking gay guys talking

2208
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,390
to elderly fat guys.

2209
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,770
Fucking

2210
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,253
take it away.

2211
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:01,211
That's not cool.

2212
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:02,650
We're not going to get an honest reaction.

2213
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,610
As long as she's seen it.

2214
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:05,090
Now we can say that we were the first.

2215
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,060
Oh,

2216
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,260
she's looking right at it right now.

2217
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:11,973
Okay.

2218
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,411
Put it away.

2219
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:14,890
We're good.

2220
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,723
We're good.

2221
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:16,711
No,

2222
00:59:16,711 --> 00:59:16,780
no,

2223
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,170
no.

2224
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:18,003
That's enough.

2225
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,980
There's 69 they're

2226
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,930
blowing each other like two gentlemen.

2227
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:24,764
Who Cares?

2228
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,821
I call him.

2229
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:26,560
I'll fucking,

2230
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:26,740
yeah,

2231
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,060
I don't know.

2232
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:27,190
I,

2233
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:27,501
you know what?

2234
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:28,940
I didn't see them penetrating each other.

2235
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,080
That might've been a different vibe,

2236
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,910
but I didn't mind the
69 you've got to prove,

2237
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,430
see the accurate fucking right there.

2238
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,713
Clearly.

2239
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,180
I thought it was going to bum me out,

2240
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:42,014
but yeah,

2241
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,110
fuck him.

2242
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:43,930
That's okay.

2243
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:44,763
There you go.

2244
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:45,800
Well thank you guys.

2245
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,120
We got to do this together.

2246
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,073
You're welcome.

2247
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,650
The cons rolled,

2248
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:54,970
the Mongols rolled through Baghdad and
the 12 hundreds and killed everybody.

2249
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:58,000
Apparently Baghdad was
at one point in time,

2250
00:59:58,001 --> 01:00:00,250
like the most advanced city in the world,

2251
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,630
like their science,

2252
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,351
their literature,

2253
01:00:02,351 --> 01:00:07,120
their approach or in Islam itself was
responsible initially for like all sorts

2254
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:09,730
of like scientific and literary advances.

2255
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:14,731
And it was like a booming
like intellectual city and
Gingiss con like sent the

2256
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:17,340
guy or the what?

2257
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,470
The con it wasn't Gaviscon.

2258
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,653
Yeah,

2259
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:26,320
Iraqi soccer con and we rocking this all
when one to sent this guy a some sort

2260
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:26,940
of a letter,

2261
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:27,820
he sent a letter back.

2262
01:00:27,821 --> 01:00:28,654
They didn't like each other.

2263
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:32,200
So the Mongols just came in
and storm the city for weeks.

2264
01:00:32,201 --> 01:00:32,710
They just,

2265
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:33,160
they would,

2266
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,220
they would hurl human
fat that was on fire.

2267
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:40,660
They would kill people and light them
on fire and then it hurl it with like a

2268
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:41,590
catechol.

2269
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:44,470
So with slam onto the roofs
and start houses on fire.

2270
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:47,290
Cause apparently human fat burns
really good for a long time.

2271
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,400
Ah Dude.

2272
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:52,650
They would just flay fat off people and
like fill up catapults with it and light

2273
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:53,484
it on fire.

2274
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,960
They worked fucking crazy.

2275
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,131
These,

2276
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,420
these stories of what they did,

2277
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,350
they killed everybody.

2278
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,070
Now they killed as many as
2 million people in Baghdad.

2279
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,090
It was his little as a hundred
thousand or as many as 2 million.

2280
01:01:07,091 --> 01:01:09,220
It's really hard to tell from those days,

2281
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,680
but essentially it was
everyone who lived there.

2282
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,850
Most historians claim was around 800,000
which is an insane amount and the

2283
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,280
amount of humans they killed,

2284
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:21,010
all these people lit everything on fire,

2285
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:21,671
broke,

2286
01:01:21,671 --> 01:01:24,190
all anything that was made that was any,

2287
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:25,270
any advancements,

2288
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,590
but through all the writing in the water
and killed all the people that were

2289
01:01:29,591 --> 01:01:33,760
there killed everyone they said to the
river actually was black from the ink of

2290
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:35,190
the books that they had thrown in,

2291
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,950
destroyed all the writing and knowledge
hundreds and hundreds of years because

2292
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:39,730
they're the Mongols.

2293
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:44,730
They don't give a fuck the Mongols
where it should have good kingus Khan.

2294
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,780
Genghis Khan himself is responsible
for as many as 70 deaths,

2295
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,160
70 million deaths,

2296
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:52,240
70 million.

2297
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:52,701
Geez.

2298
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,340
Like him and the Mongols and his,

2299
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:57,550
his invasions and his conquering
different parts of the world.

2300
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,060
They,

2301
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,440
they're responsible for as
many as 70 million death.

2302
01:02:00,441 --> 01:02:01,030
Jesus.

2303
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:01,860
Brian.

2304
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,360
Like what we think about like,

2305
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:07,930
like Hitler layer didn't have shit on
this motherfucker cause this guy did it

2306
01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:08,950
all at a horse.

2307
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:10,983
Okay.

2308
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,250
Does up the Annie?

2309
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:14,050
Yes.

2310
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:17,510
He killed 70 million people
on horseback and kill.

2311
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,650
Kill more than 20 million.

2312
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,040
It's quite

2313
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,241
a few.

2314
01:02:20,241 --> 01:02:20,700
Really?

2315
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,533
Yeah.

2316
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,471
Fuck yeah.

2317
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:23,490
They all killed a lot of people.

2318
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:24,690
I've killed no one.

2319
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,620
What about you guys?

2320
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:26,671
I'm at zero,

2321
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:27,470
right?

2322
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:27,630
Yeah.

2323
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,830
You're not much of a conqueror.

2324
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,780
A couple of dogs and I was little.

2325
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:32,910
It's hard to wrap your head
around that kind of money,

2326
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:33,744
man.

2327
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,820
He kneeled on durable.

2328
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,013
Yeah.

2329
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,163
Dead

2330
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,000
terrible blood was on my knee.

2331
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:49,980
My mom didn't want us to get away so we
just put it in an empty tub and we were

2332
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,490
hanging out with the new terrible
and I nailed that and they killed it.

2333
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,033
That's a wrap.

2334
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:59,700
That's more depressing than the 70
million dead people in Baghdad or the head

2335
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:00,534
shopping.

2336
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,131
You're like,

2337
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:02,471
wow,

2338
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:02,851
Amy,

2339
01:03:02,851 --> 01:03:04,110
a way to bring it down.

2340
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:04,301
Oh,

2341
01:03:04,301 --> 01:03:04,651
okay.

2342
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:09,651
I thought we were just showing the sodomy
so lucky that there's no Gingiss con

2343
01:03:09,941 --> 01:03:10,774
today.

2344
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,370
It seems like it's just luck

2345
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,240
when someone like that comes along.

2346
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,610
It's like Dan Carlin is a name for him.

2347
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:22,230
He calls them historical arsonists.

2348
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,140
But like there's a very rare that
you get an Alexander the Great,

2349
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,180
or you get a Gig as are
you getting Napoleon,

2350
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,811
you know,

2351
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:28,660
or Cesar.

2352
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,180
Why when these guys come along,

2353
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,600
they just wreck shop for like 50 60
world change the world in 50 or 60 years.

2354
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:37,110
The God killed 70 million.

2355
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:42,310
So you've got a drastic change in politics
and people say never again campaign

2356
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,760
like a,

2357
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,390
we did like the fruit juice.

2358
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,960
The Muslims went into China.

2359
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,740
They said they killed anyone.

2360
01:03:50,741 --> 01:03:51,574
I don't want to forget.

2361
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:53,260
They didn't know they killed everyone.

2362
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,501
They did.

2363
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:54,334
They didn't care.

2364
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,370
Kill everyone.

2365
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:58,970
They would leave and then come back in
three days and kill everyone they missed.

2366
01:03:59,070 --> 01:03:59,190
Oh,

2367
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:02,320
like people that were hiding him because
they knew that people would hide.

2368
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,010
So I told my dad and the Israeli army,

2369
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,160
they told them somebody threw a grenade
into kindergarten once they found out

2370
01:04:07,161 --> 01:04:08,030
which village was from.

2371
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,770
I said kill everything moving.

2372
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,040
Oh my God.

2373
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:12,603
Yeah,

2374
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,673
yeah,

2375
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:14,621
yeah,

2376
01:04:14,621 --> 01:04:15,190
that's right.

2377
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,850
Wow.

2378
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:16,690
Holy Shit.

2379
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,793
Yeah.

2380
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:18,490
They said that the,

2381
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,323
the um,

2382
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,430
the Muslims had taken a,

2383
01:04:21,431 --> 01:04:21,890
um,

2384
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:22,530
a,

2385
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,620
a crew to go into China for the first
time to see what China was all about.

2386
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:30,550
Cause they heard all these rumors about
how much money enriches were in China

2387
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:34,690
and they had a gigantic army and the
Caribbean Shaw and they were going to go

2388
01:04:34,691 --> 01:04:34,841
in,

2389
01:04:34,841 --> 01:04:35,674
they were going to like,

2390
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,540
like they were eventually
going to invade China

2391
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,660
when they got their Christmas shows,

2392
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:43,120
me and Sha say,

2393
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,320
w boom.

2394
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,530
So when they go there,

2395
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:45,980
they just saw

2396
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:49,100
these white peaks in the background
that they thought were snow covered

2397
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:52,220
mountains that were
actually mountains of bones

2398
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:55,820
because in this time in this town,

2399
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,780
this is one town,

2400
01:04:56,781 --> 01:04:59,960
they killed 2 million people
and there's one area in China.

2401
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,050
The Mongols came in and killed everybody.

2402
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:03,351
Like,

2403
01:05:03,351 --> 01:05:08,351
we don't even understand what this kind
of carnage must have been like when you

2404
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:12,890
talking about 1200 and
when you think about today,

2405
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:17,360
like there's no group of humans that
everyone's a murderer and psychopath.

2406
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,840
Like you got thousand serial killers.

2407
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:22,880
They're not organized serial killers.

2408
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,110
Like look at al Qaeda.

2409
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,690
I mean how many people were going
out kind everyone's Terrell.

2410
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:25,890
Fred.

2411
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,421
I tried it.

2412
01:05:26,421 --> 01:05:28,250
Was it 30 dudes that are fucking crazy?

2413
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,420
I was Osama bin Laden.

2414
01:05:29,421 --> 01:05:32,120
They killed and he was living
with six people in the country.

2415
01:05:32,121 --> 01:05:34,790
At least serious raised entire cities.

2416
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:35,990
Just put,

2417
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,823
taking boulders.

2418
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:38,660
This is like your younger years ago.

2419
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:39,310
Wait,

2420
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:39,850
what city?

2421
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:40,683
I was in high school.

2422
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,570
Uh,

2423
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,940
I dunno when I was in high school.

2424
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,190
I was thinking of saying I started but
that's the guy who pulled those and

2425
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:49,670
killed,

2426
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,070
they killed everybody in the city
cause everybody cause they protested.

2427
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:52,670
Wow.

2428
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:53,503
Destroy the city.

2429
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:54,343
How many people?

2430
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:55,280
I Dunno.

2431
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:55,610
Wow.

2432
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:56,870
But it a lot like thousands.

2433
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,733
Thousands of people.

2434
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:58,603
Oh Wow.

2435
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,170
This is while it's still a high school.

2436
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,471
Yeah.

2437
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:01,580
Well let's don't let it get out.

2438
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:02,331
And coincidentally,

2439
01:06:02,331 --> 01:06:03,200
what part of the world is it?

2440
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:03,930
The same?

2441
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:04,300
Yeah,

2442
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,270
same part of the world.

2443
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:08,240
So he left so left people there.

2444
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:11,480
This is what happened to rape and
get the genetics when he came.

2445
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,721
Oh,

2446
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:12,320
they raped ever.

2447
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,030
All the women,

2448
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:16,640
they say that in one part
of the world and that Asia,

2449
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:17,450
that part of the world,

2450
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,960
more than 5% of the people that
live there have gang has cons.

2451
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:21,970
Um,

2452
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:22,803
them.

2453
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:23,481
Yeah,

2454
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:26,000
I think it's 5% I might have made
that at home or out of his own.

2455
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,410
Please do your own Google search.

2456
01:06:27,411 --> 01:06:27,511
Right?

2457
01:06:27,511 --> 01:06:28,520
So game of Thrones.

2458
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:28,730
Yeah.

2459
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:29,030
Yeah.

2460
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:29,620
But this guy,

2461
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:29,750
no,

2462
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,190
he's way crazier than game of Thrones.

2463
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:31,620
This,

2464
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,890
this is the craziest guy in human history.

2465
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:34,280
Yeah.

2466
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,720
Like everybody wants to talk about Hitler.

2467
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,060
Genghis Khan was way crazier than Hitler.

2468
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:43,210
They would storm into towns and just
kill everything out of the blue babies,

2469
01:06:43,551 --> 01:06:44,061
women,

2470
01:06:44,061 --> 01:06:44,990
children,

2471
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:45,531
rape,

2472
01:06:45,531 --> 01:06:46,760
kill everything.

2473
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:47,990
Kill everybody.

2474
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,770
They would take people and cut their
skin off and force feed it to them until

2475
01:06:51,771 --> 01:06:52,604
they died.

2476
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:53,860
They would do on skin.

2477
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:54,381
Yeah.

2478
01:06:54,381 --> 01:06:54,911
They do the,

2479
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:55,151
they,

2480
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:56,230
they killed people and yeah.

2481
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,350
What have you met her if they
were eating somebody else's skin?

2482
01:06:58,650 --> 01:06:59,261
Some of the low,

2483
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,290
I think I might rather eat my own skin.

2484
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:05,790
Then a stranger he would send
like even you and I know you.

2485
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:07,200
I think I'd probably still rather get my,

2486
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,160
my Mayan skin.

2487
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:09,530
He looks delicious.

2488
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:09,660
Oh,

2489
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,181
he does?

2490
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:10,560
Like he's,

2491
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:10,681
Oh,

2492
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:11,011
please.

2493
01:07:11,011 --> 01:07:11,511
He's adorable.

2494
01:07:11,511 --> 01:07:12,130
What about

2495
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:12,581
guy though?

2496
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:12,921
Fuck.

2497
01:07:12,921 --> 01:07:14,800
I would be very tender
that you barely knew.

2498
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:15,730
Yeah.

2499
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:16,660
What about fat woman?

2500
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:17,970
I'd be more tender.

2501
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:18,431
No,

2502
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:19,200
I can't eat a family.

2503
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:19,430
Yeah,

2504
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:20,860
you'd be filled with like a cigarette.

2505
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:21,291
He tastes,

2506
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:21,490
yeah.

2507
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:22,323
Ah,

2508
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:23,861
that's smoked.

2509
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:24,694
Smoked flavor.

2510
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,290
You might be right.

2511
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:27,620
That might sort of help this.

2512
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,020
You don't know til you try it.

2513
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:29,360
Yeah.

2514
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,250
Brian cut off some skin.

2515
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:30,750
Okay.

2516
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,540
Yeah.

2517
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,220
If we were to cook one of us,

2518
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,361
I would want to cook.

2519
01:07:34,361 --> 01:07:35,140
You me?

2520
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:35,530
Yeah.

2521
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:36,070
Why?

2522
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:36,590
Most muscle?

2523
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:36,760
No,

2524
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,900
I just went on my instinct.

2525
01:07:37,901 --> 01:07:38,111
What do,

2526
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,940
what do you think?

2527
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,221
Yeah,

2528
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,180
I was going to say
Brian for for most meat,

2529
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,350
but I don't know what makes
most meet tough to chew on.

2530
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,101
I know,

2531
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:45,910
I know.

2532
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,020
I think it would be good.

2533
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,560
Definitely want to be Jamie because
he's the one that he's doing this.

2534
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,411
How is this?

2535
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:51,244
Sure,

2536
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,610
Dan,

2537
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:54,443
this.

2538
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,020
Yeah,

2539
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,040
if you had to,

2540
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,380
if you had to a,

2541
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,380
if you will like trapped,

2542
01:07:59,440 --> 01:07:59,890
uh,

2543
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:04,240
in like one of those a Yukon things where
you got to eat someone university of

2544
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:04,950
Connecticut.

2545
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:05,540
No,

2546
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:06,373
no.

2547
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:07,643
Oh right.

2548
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,441
That makes more sense.

2549
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:09,610
Don't kill people in Connecticut.

2550
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:10,030
Need them.

2551
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,800
Why they're so boring.

2552
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:12,970
If it was like the Donner party,

2553
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,370
there was a couple when we were traveling

2554
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:16,790
from north,

2555
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:20,090
that was from Connecticut and you could
see these motherfuckers from a mile away

2556
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:22,490
and Joey Diaz and I would look
at him and I actually said,

2557
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:22,970
I go,

2558
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,710
I go look at these
Connecticut white people.

2559
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,950
I go look at them like that.

2560
01:08:25,951 --> 01:08:26,780
I think you could just tell.

2561
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,320
And he goes,

2562
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:27,561
he goes,

2563
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,270
how can you tell?

2564
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:28,671
And I go,

2565
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:29,900
look at the kids' shoes.

2566
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,520
The kid was wearing boat shoes.

2567
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,161
Oh boy.

2568
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:32,751
A young boy,

2569
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:33,584
he was like 10.

2570
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,900
And he's wearing boat shoes with shorts,

2571
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:38,220
with a belt on Beltane shorts.

2572
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,970
They don't grow up around enough black
people that they have fear in them.

2573
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:43,070
So they just do whatever they want.

2574
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:44,000
It's like no Portland,

2575
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,050
they're missing character.

2576
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:45,441
No,

2577
01:08:45,441 --> 01:08:46,460
it's worse than Portland.

2578
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:50,150
Way Worse Portland's way better
than Connecticut and Connecticut.

2579
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:53,600
You have all these like weird rich dads
that had been stealing money in the

2580
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:57,140
stock market the whole life and they pay
for these kids to go to private schools

2581
01:08:57,141 --> 01:09:00,140
where they all stare at each other cause
no one's getting any education at home

2582
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:04,160
because your mom's on pills and her face
can't move cause she shot botox into it

2583
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:08,270
and she's fucking Disney all day cause
she's got a Xanax addiction and all of

2584
01:09:08,271 --> 01:09:09,350
you to stare at each other.

2585
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,220
Just handled little whales on them
cause you think your alternative.

2586
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:15,710
But really you're just a
rich little piece of shit.

2587
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:17,180
You have a crest on your,

2588
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:20,420
you're crazy and you're going to start
fucking your male friends just cause

2589
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:24,770
you're so bored from your weight and
title life and your wife hates you.

2590
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,480
They were all traveling together.

2591
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:27,141
This,

2592
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:29,870
this woman didn't understand why
she had to take her shoes off.

2593
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:30,710
It was hilarious.

2594
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:31,870
They were telling us

2595
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,120
where this bitch has been living,

2596
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:35,871
but she goes,

2597
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,190
my shoes are open toed.

2598
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:38,340
You can see my feet and like,

2599
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,120
you have to take your shoes off.

2600
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,780
I belonged to equinox.

2601
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:42,710
Do you understand?

2602
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,330
It's like literally
arguing with her husband.

2603
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:44,870
She's like,

2604
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:45,830
it's open toed.

2605
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:47,360
I think you can wear
them over their husband.

2606
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:47,451
Like,

2607
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:49,670
what's he going to do fucker in the face

2608
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:56,360
or at least passes out and
just wakes up a learned person.

2609
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:56,910
Well,

2610
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:57,830
I can't do that again.

2611
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,073
Uh,

2612
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:01,190
he was tired at that point.

2613
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,093
Oh,

2614
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:04,610
we ain't breakfast.

2615
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,440
It was about to crash dog.

2616
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,190
I'm like,

2617
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:07,660
God,

2618
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,630
him in Connecticut.

2619
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:10,730
I'd like to see while
we were in Jersey too,

2620
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:11,271
which is the,

2621
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:11,640
it's,

2622
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:11,891
you know,

2623
01:10:11,891 --> 01:10:12,570
it was a,

2624
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:13,430
it was Connecticut.

2625
01:10:13,431 --> 01:10:15,920
People in Jersey and Joey
are going to Phoenix.

2626
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:16,260
Oh,

2627
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,093
you're doing that?

2628
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:23,020
Two of us at night by night.

2629
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,863
Thursday night.

2630
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,790
Please come on that week.

2631
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,800
The two of you come down that
week and we'll blow it up.

2632
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:30,411
Oh,

2633
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:31,244
it's next week.

2634
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:31,790
Okay.

2635
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:32,420
Come on.

2636
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,253
Come on next week.

2637
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,170
Tomorrow.

2638
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,060
Are you guys going to be here?

2639
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:35,860
Okay.

2640
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:36,650
Yeah,

2641
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:37,460
let's blow it up.

2642
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:37,881
That's right.

2643
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:38,714
It's may already.

2644
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:39,391
Do you love it?

2645
01:10:39,391 --> 01:10:39,650
It's fun.

2646
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:40,131
It was just like,

2647
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:41,030
just turned April.

2648
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:42,660
Wait,

2649
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,760
what fuck is going on?

2650
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:46,760
This winter was a joke.

2651
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:51,770
It was because we don't really have a
winter bad New York sucked to this winter.

2652
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:55,883
I,

2653
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:56,860
Hey,

2654
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,693
the weather,

2655
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,570
you know what he's like decided
that la people are too shallow.

2656
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,450
That's how you feel judged.

2657
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:09,130
What happened?

2658
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:11,690
And he's tired of bad about,

2659
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:12,524
uh,

2660
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,250
about the business out here.

2661
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:18,110
New stages is good and you know,

2662
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:19,380
a new people,

2663
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:19,940
new experiences,

2664
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:20,320
experience.

2665
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,630
Well comics to watch,

2666
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:21,910
you know,

2667
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,340
new styles of comedy.

2668
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,833
Oh,

2669
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,080
that goes into my train of thought.

2670
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:28,830
I want to go,

2671
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:29,520
here's my theory.

2672
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,790
A little bit of like 5% once a day
to a black check for like two months.

2673
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:33,480
Harlem shake.

2674
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:33,661
Yeah.

2675
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:34,500
Here's another party.

2676
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:37,650
You marrying a black church and after
the black chick doesn't work out,

2677
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:38,550
it will get the Julius.

2678
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,300
Oh,

2679
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,340
he married your mom.

2680
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,780
You Shit your pants again.

2681
01:11:46,781 --> 01:11:48,490
I'm not cleaning this.

2682
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:52,150
You mind if I introduced Mike,

2683
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,540
that girlfriend to you?

2684
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:54,460
I would just be ashamed.

2685
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:55,303
I'm like,

2686
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,151
here's my girlfriend,

2687
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:56,984
a viva.

2688
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,460
Viva.

2689
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,293
What happened?

2690
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,273
Bam

2691
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,423
tapped out.

2692
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,310
It's named after hand sanitizer.

2693
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:04,521
Yeah,

2694
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:05,354
you found it.

2695
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,613
Yeah.

2696
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,040
That's not good.

2697
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,870
Have you ever got that lecture?

2698
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:10,761
No.

2699
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:11,594
Shit.

2700
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,153
No.

2701
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,533
Oh,

2702
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:16,450
I'm going to and uh,

2703
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,580
I know some of the black guy.

2704
01:12:19,581 --> 01:12:20,414
We should push it.

2705
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,490
I have it set up earlier.

2706
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,150
I don't know.

2707
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,410
You have it set up like you said.

2708
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:25,980
Hey listen,

2709
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:27,771
what a fuck.

2710
01:12:27,771 --> 01:12:29,400
A black chick and you're black chick.

2711
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:30,740
So what's the secret?

2712
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,500
It's a secret secret to the world.

2713
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:33,891
He did.

2714
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:34,760
He used a secret.

2715
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:35,500
Smart.

2716
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,350
That's a beautiful thing.

2717
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,921
That secret.

2718
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:39,370
It really seems to weed.

2719
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:42,110
That'd be funny if you're inside
of a house and a family like you,

2720
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:47,111
just secret like a huge black cock guide
was the Black Hawk sit like 10 minutes

2721
01:12:48,591 --> 01:12:50,500
and meditate guys visit.

2722
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:52,110
So one day,

2723
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:56,180
one day a guy breaks into your
house at the exact moment he's here.

2724
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,021
How racist.

2725
01:12:57,021 --> 01:12:59,280
I just assume that a guy would
have to break in your house.

2726
01:12:59,290 --> 01:12:59,910
Really funny.

2727
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:03,980
Really funny to picture a Connecticut
woman sitting in her home like,

2728
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:04,641
oh,

2729
01:13:04,641 --> 01:13:05,540
you made it.

2730
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,090
And like she thinks this
guy is going gonna fuck her.

2731
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:07,821
And he robs her.

2732
01:13:07,821 --> 01:13:09,470
That's great clubs or over the head.

2733
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,110
That's great.

2734
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:13,730
Cut your finger off to get her rank
cause it's stuck on that thing cause she

2735
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:15,440
doesn't ever take it off
cause she's embarrassing.

2736
01:13:15,441 --> 01:13:17,750
Meant that she floated,

2737
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:19,520
she did our finger washes,

2738
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,211
eats everything.

2739
01:13:20,211 --> 01:13:23,060
Whenever you can't take it off
and blood diamond on her thing,

2740
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,610
she has to hack it off with a chainsaw.

2741
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:27,330
Hey,

2742
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,780
there's no way.

2743
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,640
It just won't do it.

2744
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,640
Not Quick enough.

2745
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,051
Meanwhile,

2746
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:34,100
she just wants to Black Hawk.

2747
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:37,110
He didn't even know that
we're giving it to her,

2748
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,150
but he's going to take her shit.

2749
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:38,670
Awesome.

2750
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,040
Didn't go fantasy and then be like,

2751
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:41,990
oh it's been working out
at all the way I want.

2752
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,150
Isn't it funny how that would
be horrific for one person,

2753
01:13:44,151 --> 01:13:45,220
but yet another chicken?

2754
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,320
Yes.

2755
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,020
Yeah.

2756
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:47,360
He'd be like,

2757
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,950
Oh this is my fucking day.

2758
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:49,431
Yeah.

2759
01:13:49,431 --> 01:13:51,250
Finally some gangster Dick.

2760
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,103
It's do it.

2761
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:52,481
If you don't,

2762
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:52,701
you don't.

2763
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:53,220
With black blackjack.

2764
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:53,690
If you,

2765
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,130
I've never been with a black check.

2766
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:55,531
One,

2767
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:55,710
two,

2768
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:56,630
three white so far.

2769
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:56,930
But um,

2770
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:57,050
I,

2771
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:57,261
you know,

2772
01:13:57,261 --> 01:13:58,031
I hope to branch out.

2773
01:13:58,031 --> 01:13:58,700
Yes.

2774
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,410
What about like any of the,

2775
01:14:00,411 --> 01:14:00,481
uh,

2776
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:01,730
alternative races?

2777
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:03,200
I've been Asians,

2778
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:03,980
the FMLA,

2779
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:04,700
I would,

2780
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,900
I'm open to whatever I,

2781
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:06,560
yeah,

2782
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,070
sure.

2783
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:07,221
No,

2784
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:09,500
I think if you've never dealt
with anything but white.

2785
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:10,130
Yeah,

2786
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:10,940
no way.

2787
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,773
Yeah.

2788
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,491
Wait a minute.

2789
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:13,240
First of all,

2790
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,600
why would you assume she has this
such an extensive sexual background?

2791
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:17,260
Because of her act?

2792
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,230
She's a cat.

2793
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:22,810
She seems like the type of cow that
guy sits a fucking gets to know her.

2794
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:24,100
Any hangs out for a while.

2795
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:24,431
Jesus.

2796
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:25,264
Whoa.

2797
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,210
She wouldn't have a bunch of different
relationships if I want to sleep with

2798
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:29,620
someone and happens real quick.

2799
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:30,520
Like within an hours.

2800
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,510
Yeah.

2801
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:32,500
Well there's nothing wrong with that.

2802
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:33,483
I Know

2803
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,460
Ryan and I were talking yesterday about
the different girls that we dated for

2804
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:41,110
like like a long time ago.

2805
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:46,360
Windup slept with him the first
day [inaudible] relationship,

2806
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,010
but yet to use it as a bargaining chip.

2807
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:48,710
It's just like,

2808
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:49,040
yeah,

2809
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:49,873
well,

2810
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,441
you know what?

2811
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:52,000
That's because you don't
have anything else to offer.

2812
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,200
That's usually what that's all about.

2813
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:56,230
Or maybe I've friends that just seriously
aren't ready and they need to really

2814
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:56,771
trust someone,

2815
01:14:56,771 --> 01:15:00,100
but if I physically am drawn to
somebody and I want to sleep with them,

2816
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,170
I gone wrong with that.

2817
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,070
There's nothing wrong with that.

2818
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:03,261
There were,

2819
01:15:03,261 --> 01:15:05,860
the problem with that is it too many
people in the world are assholes and so

2820
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:09,730
that doesn't work out well because every
now and then you fucking asshole and

2821
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:10,890
then you've got an ass hole in your life.

2822
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,230
You're like,

2823
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,063
ah,

2824
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:12,340
yeah,

2825
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,940
she got to know this person better for,

2826
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:14,893
yeah,

2827
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:16,400
you're right.

2828
01:15:16,401 --> 01:15:17,360
Then then you're done with them.

2829
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,740
Get to know them like you
introduced them again.

2830
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:22,850
You have sex with him again and again,

2831
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,080
and then you start hanging out with them.

2832
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:24,561
You get to know him.

2833
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:24,950
Then you go,

2834
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,311
oh,

2835
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,940
okay,

2836
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,830
I should have got to know you better
because I'm not really into your

2837
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:28,340
personality.

2838
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:28,611
Right.

2839
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:33,260
I would rather have known what a piece
of shit you are because that's the worst,

2840
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:36,200
like chicks getting dressed and she
tells a nigger joke and you're like,

2841
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:36,590
oh,

2842
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:38,630
oh wow.

2843
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,583
Christ.

2844
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,960
What wasn't even looking for reactions.

2845
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:46,910
You were saying it casually
and unapologetically.

2846
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:47,270
Yeah.

2847
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,571
He's like,

2848
01:15:47,571 --> 01:15:48,404
you know,

2849
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,503
they are.

2850
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:50,500
You're like,

2851
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:50,970
oh,

2852
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:51,803
okay.

2853
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,230
Not,

2854
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,640
let's take away the plan to meet.

2855
01:15:53,641 --> 01:15:56,370
My parents had sort of already blown them
because then at least you can get that

2856
01:15:56,371 --> 01:15:56,551
in.

2857
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:57,301
You can't do it after.

2858
01:15:57,301 --> 01:15:57,960
You know that.

2859
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,640
That's a good point for a guy,

2860
01:15:59,641 --> 01:16:00,630
but not for the girl.

2861
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:01,490
I Dunno.

2862
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:01,990
For girls,

2863
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,810
not such a good point,

2864
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:05,460
but I mean sometimes you sleep with
someone as a girl and you're not,

2865
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,710
you're not interested in
building something with them.

2866
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,760
They just want some sick.

2867
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:09,653
Yeah,

2868
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,490
that person's Day.

2869
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:12,310
Yeah.

2870
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,781
Yeah.

2871
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:13,770
There's nothing wrong with that.

2872
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,570
Does absolutely nothing wrong with that.

2873
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,800
I feel okay about it.

2874
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:20,610
The problem is it's too many people that
will let you think did something wrong

2875
01:16:20,611 --> 01:16:22,830
with that because they
actually want to fuck you.

2876
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:23,431
You know?

2877
01:16:23,431 --> 01:16:24,211
Especially girls,

2878
01:16:24,211 --> 01:16:28,680
girls take so much grief from guys that
really were attracted them like fucking

2879
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:29,310
whore.

2880
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,300
She's just fucking whore.

2881
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,111
It's kind of gross,

2882
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:31,321
right?

2883
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:31,651
You guys,

2884
01:16:31,651 --> 01:16:32,640
because they're weak.

2885
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:33,181
They're weak.

2886
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:37,350
Bitch ass bodies don't realize that
terrible feeling that they're having about

2887
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:38,490
this person is discussed.

2888
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,960
It's really just rejection,

2889
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,251
rejection.

2890
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:42,360
The fact they were ignored.

2891
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,380
You know who else does that?

2892
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,493
Other girls,

2893
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:44,821
those,

2894
01:16:44,821 --> 01:16:46,230
those that say,

2895
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:47,570
you know what happened,

2896
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:48,640
but with the Ohio case,

2897
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:52,590
that's Steubenville coast with a girl
was being dragged like other girls are

2898
01:16:52,591 --> 01:16:53,424
calling her a slut.

2899
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,210
Oh,

2900
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,320
makes me so mad.

2901
01:16:55,321 --> 01:16:57,150
I did nothing to help that one graphic.

2902
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:58,140
That's terrific.

2903
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:00,770
And I can't say the same thing at
their competitive nature or something.

2904
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:01,681
Wow.

2905
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:04,440
The thing about Amy talking about
chicks wanted to kill themselves in the

2906
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:05,640
elevator or each other.

2907
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,670
That's how you paraphrase.

2908
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:07,504
It doesn't work.

2909
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,650
That's why I can't trust the member.

2910
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:09,260
When Amy,

2911
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,160
she wanted to throw herself

2912
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,480
down an elevator shaft on,

2913
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,050
no,

2914
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:12,291
no,

2915
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:14,150
I didn't use my own
pitches with elevators.

2916
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:14,511
I wait.

2917
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:15,170
Hold on a minute.

2918
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,040
I don't think I said that.

2919
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,300
Yeah,

2920
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:17,960
that's doable.

2921
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,890
Thing was really upset,

2922
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:19,793
really was,

2923
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,893
well,

2924
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,130
what is that?

2925
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,840
Is that the family?

2926
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:28,250
Is it the people not talking to people
about the opposite sex being human

2927
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:28,730
culture,

2928
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:30,620
whole high school.

2929
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,960
It wasn't just one family.

2930
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:32,121
Yeah,

2931
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:32,661
you're right.

2932
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:33,500
Not only the high school,

2933
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:37,790
it was actually the adults because they
were hiding it because they didn't want

2934
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,040
it to fuck up the high school.

2935
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,250
It really is like crazy.

2936
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,150
It's everybody in the community
making these guys feel invincible and

2937
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:50,710
untouchable and you can do whatever you
want your gods right now you're got so

2938
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,780
crazy and I was his girl just really drunk

2939
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,880
and no one did anything to help her.

2940
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:58,820
Ooh,

2941
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,020
Jesus Christ.

2942
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,090
That's a ooh

2943
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:03,830
human nature.

2944
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,950
It's not like about this
one coach and do anything.

2945
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,550
You know Lars von Trier movies that
I think about that all the time,

2946
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:11,384
like just if,

2947
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:15,470
if humans are given the chance
they will become complete monsters.

2948
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,670
I think that's probably true.

2949
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,650
It's certainly possible.

2950
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,700
It's not fun to think about,

2951
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:19,881
well,

2952
01:18:19,881 --> 01:18:21,650
look at this fucking Mongol
thing we were talking about,

2953
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,750
there was not even a thousand years ago.

2954
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:24,140
This is,

2955
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,790
this is heart of darkness is every movie.

2956
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:31,310
It's all about like if you take away
society back to animals and more terrified

2957
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:31,671
of that.

2958
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:32,960
I mean we're all tear up.

2959
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:33,651
That's where my,

2960
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:33,921
these,

2961
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:38,360
the mad max movies and Zombie movies is
essentially the breakdown of society are

2962
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:39,770
terrified of women

2963
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,420
were just saying about that girl.

2964
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:45,254
Like everyone,

2965
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:46,400
the girls are scared.

2966
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,980
Like if I side with her then the
guys are going to turn on me.

2967
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:50,420
And it's like,

2968
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,060
and I think in the Muslim side,

2969
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,700
the way they like cover
yourself and you know,

2970
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,770
it's like people have this fear and people
get upset about somebody saying like,

2971
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,030
yeah,

2972
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:04,030
I'll sleep with someone when I want to
somehow can make a failed castrate it for

2973
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:06,650
some reason that I would
maybe make my own choice.

2974
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:08,570
And I think that uh,

2975
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,340
it's being raised by week bitches too

2976
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:20,370
when he's growing up that
not every woman he likes,

2977
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:21,360
it's going to like him.

2978
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:24,990
And you got to realize that it's
not their position to like you.

2979
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:30,160
You have to suck it up and either
improve yourself as a person,

2980
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:35,411
get away your whatever deficits or find
someone who does like you gotta be worth

2981
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:36,861
something.

2982
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:39,170
You have to actually have value.

2983
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:40,640
You have to be fun to be around.

2984
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:42,160
You have to be enjoyable to talk to.

2985
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:47,840
But people don't think
that in the beginning.

2986
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:49,550
They just want you to like them.

2987
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,390
Especially like spoiled people.

2988
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,600
We know like spoiled Shitty
dudes who like their dad.

2989
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:04,100
Like they can do no wrong.

2990
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,271
These kids,

2991
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:07,010
they show up and they're fucking assholes.

2992
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,190
It

2993
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,190
is guys and girls versions.

2994
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,620
I mean let's just call
a spade a spade here.

2995
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,750
Well this is what this
guy was talking about.

2996
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:16,800
This is why it's fascinating.

2997
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:17,640
The Mongol thing,

2998
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,620
because he said when Baghdad was raided
by the Mongols and they crushed the

2999
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:23,454
society,

3000
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:26,940
they basically started from scratch after
that with the people that were in the

3001
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:27,774
outskirts.

3002
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:30,420
I mean that is literally
what happened with Baghdad.

3003
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:32,940
They had a repopulate
Baghdad rebuild everything.

3004
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:37,941
He killed everyone and through all the
literature away so that they see that

3005
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:43,071
today they're just getting to the point
like culturally of where they were in

3006
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:47,700
2012 and I bet a lot of
those people were like,

3007
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:49,470
let's not go in right away to the city.

3008
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:50,700
Let's wait another three days.

3009
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:51,360
Yeah.

3010
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,780
But it's also like the
distrust and like they were,

3011
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:58,200
I started reading about it after listening
to this cause it's so interesting.

3012
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:02,040
I was like there's this people that equate
the whole distrust of foreigners and

3013
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:05,940
the outside world to being invaded by
the Mongols that apparently the Muslim

3014
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:09,840
religion and Islamic culture was
completely different back then.

3015
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,610
And it was like the Greeks,

3016
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,960
it was like the Romans.

3017
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:14,070
It was like people that were like,

3018
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:14,461
you know,

3019
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:19,140
actively trying to pursue education
and enrichment and science.

3020
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,950
It was a completely different type
of culture or either where they,

3021
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:25,350
I mean they thought they
had the greater army,

3022
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:25,561
the,

3023
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:25,821
the,

3024
01:21:25,821 --> 01:21:26,021
the,

3025
01:21:26,021 --> 01:21:26,161
the,

3026
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:26,994
the walls too.

3027
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,890
They thought they had the greater army,

3028
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:31,290
but they didn't understand
how gangster the Mongols are.

3029
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,420
The Mongols were throwing trees at them.

3030
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,100
They cut all their trees down.

3031
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:36,120
They took two weeks,

3032
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,090
they cut all their trees down everywhere,

3033
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,320
all around the city.

3034
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:45,470
And then they stack them up with giant
catapult and hurled them over the gates

3035
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:47,550
destroying everything in the city.

3036
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,010
So imagine Taylor,

3037
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:49,844
the Hobbit,

3038
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:55,860
12 a d and you're sitting
there full size palm trees,

3039
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:59,370
whirling or destroying mosques.

3040
01:21:59,371 --> 01:21:59,941
And they did this,

3041
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:00,331
by the way,

3042
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:04,170
for two weeks before they
started to go in just launching,

3043
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:07,080
launching fiery shit at them,

3044
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,130
launching,

3045
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,210
launching things,

3046
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:09,450
raw,

3047
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,680
launching rocks.

3048
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:12,120
They collected rocks,

3049
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,560
launching them into the city.

3050
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,180
So they basically over the walls,

3051
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,160
everything's getting pulverized,

3052
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,090
everything's getting crushed that can't
go outside the gates cause they keep,

3053
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:20,970
they can't get more food,

3054
01:22:20,971 --> 01:22:21,840
they can't get anything.

3055
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,040
And these motherfuckers,

3056
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:28,041
these crazy savage barbarian sociopath's
on horses with each guy at a horse.

3057
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:32,100
And then they had nine extra horses.

3058
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,030
So there's hundreds of thousands of
animals and people outside your gates and

3059
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:39,300
they're hurling trees at you
just waiting for you to give up.

3060
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,500
And everything's on fire.

3061
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:41,700
Everything's on fire,

3062
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:42,990
everyone's dying in front of you.

3063
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,010
And then boom,

3064
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:48,360
they come in and when they come in they
just cut down everyone running through

3065
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:49,194
the streets,

3066
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,770
cutting people in half
everybody they find dead.

3067
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,570
Everybody hiding dead.

3068
01:22:54,571 --> 01:22:59,250
Everybody in any mosque dead just
come in chopping heads off dead.

3069
01:22:59,400 --> 01:22:59,800
And they,

3070
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,440
they would do this and they
would completely clean out
an entire area like they

3071
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:06,990
changed entire course of human history.

3072
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:07,320
They weren't,

3073
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,180
they weren't looking to take survivors,

3074
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:10,853
survivors.

3075
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:11,970
If they took survivors,

3076
01:23:11,971 --> 01:23:15,180
it was only because they were at war with
someone else and what they would do is

3077
01:23:15,181 --> 01:23:19,350
take the survivors and put them in the
front lines and use them oftentimes as

3078
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:23,670
the the front who would push an army into
the town and people would be shooting

3079
01:23:23,671 --> 01:23:27,300
arrows at their own friends because their
own friends would be forced to be at

3080
01:23:27,301 --> 01:23:29,670
the front line of this army behind them.

3081
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:33,180
They would see the Mongols on their horses
and these people would have thousands

3082
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,280
and thousands of people just be
forced through the door of a,

3083
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:35,770
of,

3084
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,041
of a,

3085
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:37,170
of the gate of a,

3086
01:23:37,171 --> 01:23:38,310
of a city.

3087
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,910
Sure was insane times,

3088
01:23:41,911 --> 01:23:42,131
man,

3089
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:42,870
I love this stuff.

3090
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:43,411
Oh Man.

3091
01:23:43,411 --> 01:23:44,244
It's incredible.

3092
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,070
It's just so fascinating to know.

3093
01:23:46,071 --> 01:23:46,904
I am.

3094
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:51,720
I love watching the broad spectrum of
people in this life that we encounter,

3095
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:52,801
but this is this,

3096
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:53,460
this life.

3097
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:57,390
It's so interesting to see that people
just like you and I were living in that

3098
01:23:57,391 --> 01:23:58,224
world.

3099
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,160
It's like it's,

3100
01:23:59,161 --> 01:23:59,671
it's just,

3101
01:23:59,671 --> 01:24:01,200
it's the same species,

3102
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:05,550
the exact same species as you and I
are dealing with all over the world.

3103
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:05,971
It's just,

3104
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:06,870
it was a thousand years ago.

3105
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:07,770
It's the same thing.

3106
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,570
I think we would have been

3107
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:10,980
bad ass is then you would
have been dead or rate.

3108
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,530
We'll like,

3109
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:15,770
do you have an extra leading up to
all leading up to my rape and yes,

3110
01:24:15,771 --> 01:24:16,610
of course I do.

3111
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:20,660
How good am I gone on one to 10
my voice is a 12 and you know it.

3112
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,920
So they kept you around and then what?

3113
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,340
You would have become
more than Gingiss cons.

3114
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,183
Wives.

3115
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:25,670
All right.

3116
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:26,660
You could be the funny wife.

3117
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:27,561
I'd be like,

3118
01:24:27,561 --> 01:24:28,250
you guys did.

3119
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,150
Have you heard this one?

3120
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:32,360
Remember when he killed
that first 30 million?

3121
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:33,770
Well listen to this one.

3122
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,733
Yeah.

3123
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,110
I don't know.

3124
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:37,601
Yeah,

3125
01:24:37,601 --> 01:24:38,510
it'd be good to have in Washington.

3126
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:39,770
We're just so lucky.

3127
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,960
We live in the the e everybody's on phone.

3128
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:44,900
Yeah,

3129
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:45,760
this guy does suck.

3130
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,820
I mean the world does suck.

3131
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,091
I mean,

3132
01:24:47,091 --> 01:24:49,700
there are things that happen like
in Boston when these two assholes,

3133
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:53,970
but there's not 100,000 of 'em
on horses storming into Boston

3134
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:57,720
telling everyone you ever heard that Mel
Gibson movie showing everybody made was

3135
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,020
wasn't innovation Apocalypto yeah,

3136
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:03,560
with all the Gringo get the Gringo,

3137
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:04,603
the beaver,

3138
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,910
the beaver beaver,

3139
01:25:07,911 --> 01:25:09,830
they shot and then he went
crazy and they're like,

3140
01:25:09,831 --> 01:25:10,431
fuck,

3141
01:25:10,431 --> 01:25:11,360
what are we going to do with this?

3142
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:12,230
Well,

3143
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:14,520
they had to know he was crazy
when they're shooting that and,

3144
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:15,670
but I didn't know if he would go bullshit.

3145
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:17,360
This shit over there
hadn't gotten out earlier.

3146
01:25:17,361 --> 01:25:17,960
They should,

3147
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,470
I guess it had celebrities are
protected while he had that one,

3148
01:25:21,471 --> 01:25:24,910
a shadow where the cops pulled them
over when he started ranting about Jews,

3149
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:25,460
I'm not going to do,

3150
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:25,551
oh,

3151
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:26,061
we were all like,

3152
01:25:26,061 --> 01:25:26,271
yeah,

3153
01:25:26,271 --> 01:25:27,140
we kind of see that.

3154
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,590
That's the sign of a real
crazy person when you don't,

3155
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,431
if you're getting racist,

3156
01:25:31,431 --> 01:25:32,390
but straight to Jews,

3157
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,273
that's like,

3158
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,811
that's true.

3159
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:36,231
I mean,

3160
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,810
that's not just like you're skipping over,

3161
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:39,561
you know,

3162
01:25:39,561 --> 01:25:40,970
but even though you're a Jew,

3163
01:25:40,971 --> 01:25:42,170
I fucking agree with you.

3164
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,033
Yeah,

3165
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,943
absolutely true.

3166
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,311
You know,

3167
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:46,530
people might discount that
because of the of your,

3168
01:25:46,531 --> 01:25:47,490
your Judaism.

3169
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:48,420
Judaism.

3170
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,253
I think it's true though.

3171
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:50,030
It's so true.

3172
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:53,310
What is something about the conspiracy
folks who've always go Jew build a

3173
01:25:53,311 --> 01:25:54,144
burger,

3174
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,850
let's build a burger.

3175
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,370
The badges out controlling
the world's economy.

3176
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,241
You don't even know.

3177
01:26:00,241 --> 01:26:00,930
I don't know,

3178
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:01,491
like build a bear,

3179
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:02,370
but with hamburgers.

3180
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,030
Yeah.

3181
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:05,240
Not Build a bear for the Burger.

3182
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:06,500
That's a good idea for you.

3183
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,731
Build a burger.

3184
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:10,250
Like make it look like a bank
would take over an old bank

3185
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,220
and turn into a burger place where you
build a burger and everybody wears like

3186
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:16,820
fucking Richard Nixon masks and all that.

3187
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:17,920
No,

3188
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,071
no.

3189
01:26:18,071 --> 01:26:18,240
Look,

3190
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,073
look,

3191
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:20,720
look like you're in a cult.

3192
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:21,821
Do you,

3193
01:26:21,821 --> 01:26:22,300
um,

3194
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,920
did you ever hear Bohemian Grove?

3195
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:25,780
Do you know this real thing
that they actually do?

3196
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,683
Really interesting.

3197
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:31,390
We're all the world's top like
financers and bankers and world leaders.

3198
01:26:31,391 --> 01:26:32,201
People from all over the world.

3199
01:26:32,201 --> 01:26:37,180
Like the Bush family's been going to
this place forever and they know it's

3200
01:26:37,181 --> 01:26:37,510
called.

3201
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:38,141
It's called,

3202
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:38,680
um,

3203
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,000
well the,

3204
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:43,070
it's called Bohemian Grove and the APP,

3205
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:48,120
the thing that worship is called Molek
and Molek is this our God and they burn

3206
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:48,760
a,

3207
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,780
they have a sacrifice.

3208
01:26:49,781 --> 01:26:50,740
They burned in effigy.

3209
01:26:50,741 --> 01:26:52,570
Like Alex Jones is crazy.

3210
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:54,040
We all know the Alex Jones is crazy.

3211
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,330
He's a fascinating dude.

3212
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,601
You know,

3213
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:56,980
he believes that it
conspiracy and everything,

3214
01:26:56,981 --> 01:27:01,390
but he actually snuck in and got video
footage of these fucking rituals these

3215
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:02,080
people do.

3216
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,010
So you're having all these world
leaders and they're wearing robes.

3217
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,440
Alex Jones slipping.

3218
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:08,560
Not even one of his guys.

3219
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:09,790
They didn't know who he was back then.

3220
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:10,541
He was,

3221
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:11,500
he was nobody back then.

3222
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:12,710
And I think he actually got caught.

3223
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:13,800
I know if he got caught,

3224
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,780
he saw them all like Brooke doin well,

3225
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,350
they had hidden camera footage of these
fucking people going through this uh,

3226
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,230
this ritual.

3227
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,740
And it's like these people
there are there weird fuckers,

3228
01:27:23,741 --> 01:27:24,120
man.

3229
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:24,220
Yeah,

3230
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,080
they really do do weird shit.

3231
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:27,910
That's like conspiracy theory shit.

3232
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:28,630
Like,

3233
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:30,250
like the skull and crossbones.

3234
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:31,810
That's real.

3235
01:27:31,811 --> 01:27:32,860
It's really weird.

3236
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,101
Yeah.

3237
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:35,600
Like the juicy Kubrick's eyes wide shut.

3238
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,310
Yes.

3239
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:41,050
Apparently that's like based on real
things that some of these weird groups do.

3240
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:41,870
Oh really?

3241
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:42,460
Yeah,

3242
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:45,730
they're just so rich and
board all do Kabbalah.

3243
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:46,793
Also

3244
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,810
the type of checks that
you can bang it off.

3245
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:58,060
You're in one of those
mass parties in Greenwich,

3246
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:58,960
Connecticut.

3247
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,680
Oh my God.

3248
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,500
Are we going to get a 32 year olds?

3249
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,770
Gigantic fucking huge ballroom.

3250
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:09,760
That's actually a part of some guys manner
and you all show up and give the keys

3251
01:28:09,761 --> 01:28:12,250
to the Valet and put your mask on.

3252
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:20,410
Especially because if they really
are complicit in some shady shit,

3253
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:25,480
whether it's they're doing like scams
and stealing money or whatever the fuck

3254
01:28:25,481 --> 01:28:26,050
they're doing,

3255
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:30,460
you're going to want the person
who's with you to like to be all in,

3256
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:31,210
you know?

3257
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:31,690
And if you,

3258
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:35,950
you know that you like their waste swap
in and you're part of some crazy group

3259
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:36,811
like you're,

3260
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:37,021
you're,

3261
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:38,560
you guys are fucking each other.

3262
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:40,110
Yeah.

3263
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:41,640
I mean you guys are living you.

3264
01:28:41,641 --> 01:28:43,120
Everyone's living in this crazy,

3265
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:43,391
you know,

3266
01:28:43,391 --> 01:28:45,500
you're going home power on me.

3267
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:49,260
You want to fuck your friends
wives that to fuck your friend.

3268
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:50,860
Well don't they always.

3269
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,243
Whenever someone,

3270
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:55,750
when they're trying to get
people into elite groups,

3271
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:59,770
they always like make you do
shit that you don't want to do.

3272
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,940
Like that's a big part
from the crips to rich.

3273
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,470
Well it's like,

3274
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,161
yeah,

3275
01:29:05,161 --> 01:29:06,390
if you want to be a part of a group,

3276
01:29:06,391 --> 01:29:07,410
you got to sacrifice,

3277
01:29:07,411 --> 01:29:07,861
you get something,

3278
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:10,240
you got to prove you're down while we're
to shoot somebody just because they're

3279
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,870
flush your lights at me just do it.

3280
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,630
Does that thing in game of Thrones
where the Khaleesi is like she gets,

3281
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:18,840
she gets this army and they all
to be a part of this elite army.

3282
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,270
They all had to kill a baby
in front of its mother.

3283
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,640
But that's like standard shit.

3284
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:24,630
Like throughout history,

3285
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,340
you're going to be a
part of some crazy group.

3286
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:27,630
You got to do something nutty.

3287
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:33,170
So these people that are like fucking
rig in the economy and stealing billions

3288
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,530
of dollars like these east Hampton cunts,

3289
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:35,970
I wanna just go to one of those parties.

3290
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,620
I just want to see a dragon.

3291
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,490
Like there's a part of me was like,

3292
01:29:41,491 --> 01:29:44,310
I bet there's a drawing in some
way or do you think there's a drag?

3293
01:29:44,311 --> 01:29:45,480
Dragons used to exist?

3294
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:47,550
Like why are there so many
dragons in human culture?

3295
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,031
Oh,

3296
01:29:48,031 --> 01:29:48,900
I hope so.

3297
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:49,680
God.

3298
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,513
Yeah,

3299
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:51,960
cause it was dragons.

3300
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:53,700
Not just in China,

3301
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:55,890
but there's dragons in
Europe at the same time.

3302
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:56,970
I think they were dragons.

3303
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:57,211
Look,

3304
01:29:57,211 --> 01:29:58,160
I'm not some return.

3305
01:29:58,161 --> 01:29:59,370
I don't think they were Unicorns,

3306
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:00,263
but there were,

3307
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:00,680
right.

3308
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,110
Yeah,

3309
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,550
I know.

3310
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,950
Do you think they breathe
fire or is that just a breath?

3311
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:06,461
No,

3312
01:30:06,461 --> 01:30:07,294
they breathe fire.

3313
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,140
Well,

3314
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,610
the Komodo dragons,

3315
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:10,953
those are nuts.

3316
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:12,970
Maybe because Komodo dragons,

3317
01:30:12,971 --> 01:30:13,750
if they bite you,

3318
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:14,770
even if you survive,

3319
01:30:14,771 --> 01:30:16,480
like you're going to die from the saliva.

3320
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:17,320
The toilet.

3321
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:17,531
Yeah.

3322
01:30:17,531 --> 01:30:18,310
Massive.

3323
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,200
They have a botulism in their saliva.

3324
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:20,891
Yeah.

3325
01:30:20,891 --> 01:30:21,490
They were just,

3326
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:23,110
their mouths are fucking the worst.

3327
01:30:23,111 --> 01:30:26,140
Just festering bacteria.

3328
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,670
I think you'd probably run fasten you.

3329
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,210
Yeah.

3330
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:30,460
They're the biggest
lizard on earth next to,

3331
01:30:30,461 --> 01:30:31,300
I think they're actually even

3332
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:31,640
bigger.

3333
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,690
The Harker picture yourself,

3334
01:30:32,691 --> 01:30:32,901
Bob.

3335
01:30:32,901 --> 01:30:33,170
We can,

3336
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,480
we'd get behind a tree.

3337
01:30:35,481 --> 01:30:35,641
What?

3338
01:30:35,641 --> 01:30:36,660
I catch them around corners.

3339
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:37,420
It's like,

3340
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:40,940
and you don't make your
songs the sooner the Lizard.

3341
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:41,913
Yeah.

3342
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:42,620
Bigger.

3343
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:43,880
But aren't they bigger than,

3344
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:46,540
so how has the Komodo
dragon the biggest drag?

3345
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:47,463
The biggest lizard?

3346
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:48,493
I don't know.

3347
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,770
Are they bigger than crocodiles?

3348
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:51,520
I think so.

3349
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,320
Can you guys watch my
television show tonight?

3350
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:54,161
Fuck yeah.

3351
01:30:54,161 --> 01:30:54,820
Bitch.

3352
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:56,680
10 30 and comedy Central Police Watch it.

3353
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,430
Um,

3354
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:59,830
and it's called inside Amy Schumer.

3355
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:00,820
Amy Schumer.

3356
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:03,410
This is what he said that
he had me laughing when
you're all doing a spy scene.

3357
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,410
Wow.

3358
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:05,000
Oh,

3359
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,660
the shows,

3360
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:08,790
they always like the
guys get to do cool shit.

3361
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:09,690
And the girls are always like,

3362
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:10,231
all right,

3363
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,490
and you just have to suck his dick.

3364
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,650
So here's what we're
doing with the mission.

3365
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:14,400
Yeah.

3366
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:14,800
But where'd you,

3367
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,780
everyone had a code name?

3368
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:18,063
Yeah.

3369
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:19,290
Yeah.

3370
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:20,970
It was like all super bad ass.

3371
01:31:20,971 --> 01:31:22,170
And then mine was butterflies.

3372
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:23,710
Butterflies.

3373
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:26,070
Creepy eating a deer.

3374
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:26,943
Oh Wow.

3375
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,050
That's a Komodo Dragon.

3376
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:28,470
Sorry.

3377
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:29,303
Yeah.

3378
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,350
Wipe your mouth.

3379
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,370
There are monsters.

3380
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,140
Komodo dragons.

3381
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,240
Hawkin animal man.

3382
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:36,263
God,

3383
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:38,203
I bet there's some,

3384
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,830
I bet it could people
in Connecticut on those.

3385
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:40,550
Oh,

3386
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:41,440
look at this with a,

3387
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:42,920
they're feeding together on a car.

3388
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:43,801
Oh,

3389
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:44,790
that's like walking dead.

3390
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:45,620
Yeah,

3391
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:46,051
exactly.

3392
01:31:46,051 --> 01:31:46,884
Like walking dead.

3393
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,220
The ones getting over the top when I
looked at it by accident and I want to go

3394
01:31:50,221 --> 01:31:50,870
hang on,

3395
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:51,110
just

3396
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,750
pulling chunks out of this thing.

3397
01:31:52,751 --> 01:31:54,530
It's ruthless fucking animal.

3398
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:56,120
How many babies or shoot,

3399
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,820
10 10 episodes.

3400
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,200
All done.

3401
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:58,560
Ready?

3402
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,261
They're all done.

3403
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:00,010
So you go on vacation

3404
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:00,390
now.

3405
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:00,730
Well that's,

3406
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:03,370
I'm going to put to New
Orleans for a month.

3407
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:04,880
Nice and right.

3408
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,630
I ain't getting new new new writing.

3409
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,110
We'll get that thing standing up on a
time lags pulling that deer out of a tree.

3410
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:13,950
What if you see that coming out of here?

3411
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:16,630
Maybe they hung it.

3412
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,040
So whatever the fuck it is,

3413
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,560
maybe they hung it so that people can,

3414
01:32:19,561 --> 01:32:19,990
uh,

3415
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,310
see it either right away.

3416
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:22,840
And then,

3417
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,620
I don't know what I would
do after that fucking day.

3418
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,250
Chasing after you did it.

3419
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,150
See the thing is,

3420
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:30,280
maybe that's where the
idea of dragon's came from.

3421
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:30,630
Cause they're,

3422
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:30,940
bro,

3423
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,740
they like fire and that breath,

3424
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:34,390
but it's really just that they're there.

3425
01:32:34,391 --> 01:32:36,250
So live as fucking toxic.

3426
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:36,810
You know,

3427
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,290
I feel like they would have
found a bone or something.

3428
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:40,450
Fire-Breathing bone.

3429
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:40,841
Look,

3430
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:41,710
they breathe fire.

3431
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,430
Trust me.

3432
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,920
Could you imagine if there wasn't an
animal that actually could breathe?

3433
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,430
Fire?

3434
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:46,210
God Damn.

3435
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:47,590
Monsanto would copyright it.

3436
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,470
They would go here and be like,

3437
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:49,060
it's ours.

3438
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:49,330
Yeah.

3439
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:49,720
They'd be like,

3440
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,500
we own it.

3441
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:54,340
And then they would just have fucking
fires and weird cities for no reason.

3442
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:56,140
Like all of a sudden Detroit's on fire.

3443
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,180
See Dragons walking through
the fucking streets.

3444
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,391
Well,

3445
01:32:58,391 --> 01:32:59,860
if you're going to light one city on fire,

3446
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,053
that's a good spot.

3447
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:02,123
Oh no,

3448
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,700
that's not what I was saying.

3449
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,693
Oh,

3450
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,633
magic.

3451
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:09,760
I think a crocodile is
technically a reptile.

3452
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:10,990
Yeah.

3453
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:12,950
Don't know what the difference
in reptile and Lizard is.

3454
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,140
Think there's a difference.

3455
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:15,670
I think that's why,

3456
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:20,060
because I don't believe that
crocodiles are large or large.

3457
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,600
It was a snake.

3458
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:24,010
A snake is a reptile as well.

3459
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,480
You know towels.

3460
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:26,560
Crocodiles are reptiles,

3461
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:28,063
so

3462
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:30,623
they just kicked in.

3463
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:31,851
Amy,

3464
01:33:31,851 --> 01:33:32,381
we're here for you.

3465
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:33,290
We're giddy because you're,

3466
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:33,611
you're,

3467
01:33:33,611 --> 01:33:34,241
you're awesome.

3468
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,700
And where around Jim Narcissism.

3469
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,070
I will believe that you really mean we,

3470
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:40,700
we were Giddy to have you here.

3471
01:33:40,701 --> 01:33:41,534
We're very excited.

3472
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,420
Why don't we get to see you
like once a year or something?

3473
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,720
Every time I come to la
I ask us to come see you.

3474
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,260
Let's try to do things more often.

3475
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:52,070
He did one night

3476
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:56,470
Moontower that the festival in Austin.

3477
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,600
Is that a comedy festival?

3478
01:33:59,020 --> 01:33:59,620
No.

3479
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,361
How's that work?

3480
01:34:00,361 --> 01:34:02,960
Is that like south by southwest but
they don't pay for Shit and they just

3481
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,680
pay for shit south by
southwest sent me something.

3482
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:08,523
It was hilarious.

3483
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:10,160
We will pay you a hundred no,

3484
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:10,381
no,

3485
01:34:10,381 --> 01:34:10,491
no,

3486
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:10,701
no,

3487
01:34:10,701 --> 01:34:10,831
no,

3488
01:34:10,831 --> 01:34:11,080
no.

3489
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,930
It said we will give you a free
pass to go see other shows.

3490
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:16,090
It's worth $1,500.

3491
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:19,000
They price that way cause they give it
out to everybody and they don't give you

3492
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:19,840
a companion pass.

3493
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,660
I've thought it was the most
ridiculous shit I've ever heard of it.

3494
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:25,451
It's not cool.

3495
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:25,881
And they end,

3496
01:34:25,881 --> 01:34:29,530
the shows are all sold out at south by
southwest and in return they will give

3497
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:31,560
your email address out to everyone.

3498
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:34,330
I have still been getting letters
saying we'd love your band.

3499
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:37,180
I had to beg for hundred
where you'll have your band.

3500
01:34:37,181 --> 01:34:38,014
Really,

3501
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:40,380
you get there.

3502
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:40,690
They're like,

3503
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:42,580
can you flyer for this band?

3504
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:43,983
You're like,

3505
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:45,730
why does anybody still do it?

3506
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,790
Because it's a cool festival but it's
kind of less go way more like this.

3507
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:49,900
It's a burrito stage now.

3508
01:34:49,901 --> 01:34:52,740
It's becoming way more
corporate Rido stage.

3509
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:55,510
Those are delicious.

3510
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:56,681
I listened.

3511
01:34:56,681 --> 01:34:57,890
I'm not on Doritos.

3512
01:34:57,891 --> 01:34:57,980
I

3513
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,070
love the fact they've moved into Taco
bell and started taking over with the cool

3514
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:01,630
ranch.

3515
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:02,460
Great merger.

3516
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,290
What a great merge.

3517
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:03,891
Amazing.

3518
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:05,210
And it's always good for you.

3519
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,410
So good for you.

3520
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:08,540
People don't know that
you're really good for Ya.

3521
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:10,820
Austin is the fucking shit.

3522
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:11,920
Yes it is.

3523
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:15,020
It's almost worth dealing
with their bullshit just so
you can go on stage there.

3524
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,830
I just don't like the idea of them make
a Dunkin made a whole video about it.

3525
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:21,620
Don't get were pull up
Dunkin's video come out.

3526
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:22,520
It's hilarious.

3527
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:23,061
Yeah.

3528
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:25,190
Pull up Duncan Trussell
on south by southwest.

3529
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:25,480
Yeah.

3530
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,900
Cause he made a whole video about it,

3531
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:29,410
which like really kind of
encapsulated it in a whole area.

3532
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:31,280
So that's how I realized
I was doing it last year.

3533
01:35:31,281 --> 01:35:32,320
And then like most show was like,

3534
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:32,601
I was like,

3535
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:32,931
you're not doing,

3536
01:35:32,931 --> 01:35:33,860
I thought you were doing south by cause.

3537
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:33,981
No,

3538
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:34,761
I switched on the pages.

3539
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:35,060
I was like,

3540
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:36,240
Oh yeah,

3541
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,353
I shouldn't be on that one.

3542
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,020
It's not a greedy thing.

3543
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:40,710
It's just like what is justice?

3544
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,530
What is the festival about?

3545
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:43,460
It's about art.

3546
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:43,941
Okay.

3547
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:45,410
How come the artists aren't getting paid?

3548
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:46,610
Like who's getting paid?

3549
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:47,900
You're making a salary.

3550
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:48,481
You're making,

3551
01:35:48,481 --> 01:35:49,670
are you guys make a profit?

3552
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:50,391
Like how's this work?

3553
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:54,200
People here who've paid to
get in so people paid to
get in and where's the money

3554
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:54,381
go?

3555
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:55,250
Does it go to charity?

3556
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,150
It goes to charity.

3557
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:56,983
I kinda get it.

3558
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:58,430
But it's got to all go to charity.

3559
01:35:58,431 --> 01:35:58,700
Yeah.

3560
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:00,230
That means you can't get paid either.

3561
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,880
They're giving you the salary.

3562
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:02,490
Ah,

3563
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:03,130
no,

3564
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:03,291
no,

3565
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:03,441
no,

3566
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:04,101
not this one.

3567
01:36:04,101 --> 01:36:04,791
Not this one.

3568
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:05,890
This has been done a billion times.

3569
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:06,763
Go to the cloud one.

3570
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,633
Not this one.

3571
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:09,740
The clown one.

3572
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,310
Yeah.

3573
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:12,290
Don't do the fucking Hitler One.

3574
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:13,041
It's so stupid.

3575
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,870
It's not even a real Hitler be one thing.

3576
01:36:14,871 --> 01:36:16,960
If it was like footage of the
real Hitler getting crazy,

3577
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,950
that's like an actor playing Hitler.

3578
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,720
The best of all those
were watching him with,

3579
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:21,561
with Jeff Ross.

3580
01:36:21,561 --> 01:36:23,060
And so who else are the parking lot?

3581
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:25,280
But although the good folk Hitler on that,

3582
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,173
on that scene,

3583
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,690
they just resell title ever.

3584
01:36:27,691 --> 01:36:28,524
They're crying.

3585
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:33,080
They told me I'd have to pay for my
airfare and hotel and then I wouldn't get

3586
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:34,280
paid to reform.

3587
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:37,810
I decided to call a clown and
offer her as similar deal.

3588
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:39,260
That's really funny.

3589
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:39,841
Yes.

3590
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:40,261
Hello?

3591
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:41,094
Can you hear me?

3592
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:42,501
Yes,

3593
01:36:42,501 --> 01:36:43,334
I can hear you.

3594
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:44,060
Hi there.

3595
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,010
My name's Melissa with Cranston.

3596
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,040
I wanted to find out,

3597
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:53,061
do you ever,

3598
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:56,210
do you ever travel out
of state to perform?

3599
01:36:58,760 --> 01:36:59,593
MMM,

3600
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:00,391
I need,

3601
01:37:00,391 --> 01:37:00,660
I,

3602
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,410
I haven't so far,

3603
01:37:02,411 --> 01:37:03,340
but why?

3604
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:04,061
Well,

3605
01:37:04,061 --> 01:37:08,530
we are throwing a kids
party out here in Austin,

3606
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:09,364
Texas.

3607
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:10,533
Um,

3608
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,160
it's it the Fisher House,

3609
01:37:12,161 --> 01:37:17,161
which is a pretty prestigious a
house in the party's going to be.

3610
01:37:17,711 --> 01:37:18,011
Well,

3611
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:20,620
it takes a lot of the elites,

3612
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:23,090
Austin elites and all.

3613
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:27,520
We've heard great things about you
on the Internet and we want a clown,

3614
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:28,510
the kid party.

3615
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:30,750
I wanted to see if you'd
be interested in performing

3616
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:32,450
well.

3617
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:32,781
I mean,

3618
01:37:32,781 --> 01:37:33,450
hey you,

3619
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:34,283
um,

3620
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:35,870
and you already checked with clown,

3621
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:36,860
like in that area.

3622
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:37,650
We want,

3623
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:42,060
we want you a clown from out of state,

3624
01:37:42,061 --> 01:37:44,070
and this is a very prestigious party.

3625
01:37:44,071 --> 01:37:44,491
Of course,

3626
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:49,200
we wouldn't be able to pay you or pay
for your airfare or for your lodging,

3627
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,230
but we'd love for you to perform
and it'd be great for your resume.

3628
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,231
Oh wait,

3629
01:37:54,231 --> 01:37:54,830
but you're,

3630
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:57,910
but you wanted me to come in
that and not pay for anything

3631
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,280
good

3632
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,630
for your crown resume.

3633
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:01,990
Uh,

3634
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:02,950
we want you to come out.

3635
01:38:02,951 --> 01:38:04,180
We can't pay for lodging,

3636
01:38:04,181 --> 01:38:06,850
airfare or pay you to perform right

3637
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:07,321
now.

3638
01:38:07,321 --> 01:38:12,321
I know this is a joke phone call or
something because this is a little funny

3639
01:38:13,261 --> 01:38:13,981
because that it,

3640
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:15,870
that it would cost me money to do it.

3641
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:16,500
She's so,

3642
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,370
it would be good for your resume.

3643
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:20,330
Okay.

3644
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:21,960
I resume take poop.

3645
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:24,740
We're a party in Austin
when I perform in La.

3646
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:28,090
Well you would be able to meet some,

3647
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:28,460
uh,

3648
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:29,231
there'd be some,

3649
01:38:29,231 --> 01:38:29,950
uh,

3650
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:30,491
pretty,

3651
01:38:30,491 --> 01:38:34,560
pretty well known musicians would are
going to be attending this party and also

3652
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:39,570
we'll be able to give you a couple of
free tickets for shows while you're in

3653
01:38:40,271 --> 01:38:41,104
town.

3654
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:42,730
Yeah,

3655
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:43,930
I'm really not interested.

3656
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:45,410
Okay.

3657
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:50,050
Doesn't clean air act the performer to
come all the way there and then not pay.

3658
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:51,990
Why'd you do it though?

3659
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:52,873
Right?

3660
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,860
Well if you want to like a real
posts or the year before consider.

3661
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,671
Are you done with it now?

3662
01:38:58,671 --> 01:38:59,510
You figured it out now.

3663
01:38:59,640 --> 01:38:59,930
Yeah,

3664
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:00,321
the cow.

3665
01:39:00,321 --> 01:39:00,770
I was going,

3666
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:01,551
if I wanted to go,

3667
01:39:01,551 --> 01:39:03,800
just go and just hang it up.

3668
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:04,640
But yeah,

3669
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:05,450
maybe get a guest Bob.

3670
01:39:05,450 --> 01:39:07,100
Maybe not like why would
I go there for that?

3671
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:11,360
I would just also what's already
on my resume then your resume.

3672
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:12,380
Oh my God.

3673
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:13,640
Is it on your card?

3674
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:17,660
Have any former weren't even going to
pay you until we found out that you work

3675
01:39:17,661 --> 01:39:18,860
for free in Texas.

3676
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,341
And we were like,

3677
01:39:19,341 --> 01:39:21,800
God Damn Chelsea,

3678
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:22,791
when they had,

3679
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:25,490
they realized they had only
booked one woman or zero women.

3680
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,040
It was two years already.

3681
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:27,470
They had,

3682
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:28,580
but they had offered us all,

3683
01:39:28,581 --> 01:39:29,271
but we just like couldn't,

3684
01:39:29,271 --> 01:39:29,730
nobody took,

3685
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:30,081
okay.

3686
01:39:30,081 --> 01:39:30,291
Yeah.

3687
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,820
That always gets like
know what they fucking,

3688
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:32,600
they offered it.

3689
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:32,781
Yeah.

3690
01:39:32,781 --> 01:39:33,351
They were like,

3691
01:39:33,351 --> 01:39:33,600
no,

3692
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,281
it was bad press.

3693
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:35,510
Like you have no women's like Oh Fox.

3694
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:36,530
Like to called Chelsea.

3695
01:39:36,531 --> 01:39:36,711
Like,

3696
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:36,861
Hey,

3697
01:39:36,861 --> 01:39:37,580
can you come down and you go,

3698
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:38,000
yeah,

3699
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,870
you're paying me.

3700
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:39,741
I know why you're calling.

3701
01:39:39,741 --> 01:39:40,490
Yeah.

3702
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:40,851
And they're like,

3703
01:39:40,851 --> 01:39:41,420
fuck fine.

3704
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:42,890
We'll pay you on a stage and age.

3705
01:39:42,891 --> 01:39:45,380
Some people she demanded
it and it was like,

3706
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:45,730
yeah,

3707
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:46,610
they have the money.

3708
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:48,470
I don't Larry.

3709
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:48,950
Yes.

3710
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:50,900
That is so funny.

3711
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:51,231
Wow.

3712
01:39:51,231 --> 01:39:52,220
That her being like,

3713
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:54,920
but you have other
aren't their local cloud.

3714
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:57,200
That's really what we are.

3715
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:01,100
It's actually a speaking opportunity.

3716
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:01,790
Oh,

3717
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:02,390
your resume.

3718
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:03,290
That's how they look at it.

3719
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:05,360
It really is like just a total,

3720
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,230
it's a chance to break as a
musician and south by southwest,

3721
01:40:09,231 --> 01:40:12,380
but not as a comedian opportunity man.

3722
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:14,360
Oh that's so funny.

3723
01:40:14,361 --> 01:40:19,361
He was a 45 minute discussion and he
can receive a complimentary gold badge,

3724
01:40:19,911 --> 01:40:23,420
a $1,350 value.

3725
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:26,240
We will give you an interactive sessions,

3726
01:40:26,241 --> 01:40:28,610
events and express.

3727
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:28,820
Yeah.

3728
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,040
It was like our rate of one night.

3729
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:32,210
[inaudible] funny actually,

3730
01:40:32,211 --> 01:40:35,450
I guess they offered me a
hotel as well as hotel access.

3731
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,720
That's a very ambiguous
because I what it means,

3732
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:40,460
it means you get first
in line for a hotel.

3733
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:42,720
They have all these people
that they give hotels too,

3734
01:40:42,721 --> 01:40:45,590
but they only have like 200 that means
you're allowed to pay for the hotel.

3735
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:45,831
Oh,

3736
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:46,790
that's hilarious.

3737
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,680
Hotel access so they can
make sure you get a hotel,

3738
01:40:51,681 --> 01:40:52,514
but you pay for it.

3739
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:53,050
Yeah.

3740
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,090
Oh that's so cute.

3741
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,090
Cool.

3742
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,620
That's so hilarious.

3743
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:59,410
Oh my goodness.

3744
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,570
People are so fucking crazy.

3745
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,410
Yeah,

3746
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:03,370
but Moontower was cool.

3747
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,210
It's,

3748
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:05,590
it's an interactive session panel.

3749
01:41:05,591 --> 01:41:06,870
I guess it's not even doing standup.

3750
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:08,800
Taking a 2.0 bitch,

3751
01:41:08,801 --> 01:41:09,521
you ain't going nowhere.

3752
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:10,354
We locked you in.

3753
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:11,943
We're in the valley.

3754
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:13,540
We are in the valley.

3755
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:14,374
You can't go.

3756
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,641
What are you going to go?

3757
01:41:15,641 --> 01:41:16,630
You get somewhere better to go.

3758
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,493
We got here.

3759
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:18,713
They didn't do a good

3760
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:20,950
bullshit shows.

3761
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:22,300
This is promotion.

3762
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:23,134
This is helping you.

3763
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:24,790
The Amish inside.

3764
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:26,170
Amy Schumer tonight

3765
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:28,750
through live tweeting,

3766
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:31,373
tweet it,

3767
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:32,920
tweet.

3768
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,753
I'm like,

3769
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:35,800
he's playing dumb cause
he doesn't want to do it.

3770
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:36,130
No,

3771
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,120
he doesn't really do tweet.

3772
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:39,340
It really is retarded.

3773
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,240
But you know where he does.

3774
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:41,130
He does Facebook.

3775
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:46,600
I've ever seen his rants
on Facebook are hilarious.

3776
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:48,370
She is the funniest you.

3777
01:41:48,371 --> 01:41:49,720
You would love him.

3778
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:52,930
We hung out together in a,

3779
01:41:53,450 --> 01:41:55,420
in Canada together,

3780
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,950
inflammatory waits for the responsible
until somebody takes it seriously and

3781
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:01,390
then just goes back and forth with them.

3782
01:42:01,391 --> 01:42:01,841
Meanwhile,

3783
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:03,420
starting a new inflammatory posts.

3784
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:04,820
Put them.

3785
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,340
He's just on there nonstop

3786
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,233
jokes.

3787
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,641
Well,

3788
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:10,640
it's a good way to right?

3789
01:42:12,630 --> 01:42:13,630
You get a fat supply.

3790
01:42:13,631 --> 01:42:14,330
Retards.

3791
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:17,520
He didn't know him and I
just read them on Facebook.

3792
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,840
It's a crazy person.

3793
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:24,550
One of the writers forwarded me that.

3794
01:42:24,551 --> 01:42:26,520
Kurt was responding to comments.

3795
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:31,660
He was actually was responding to

3796
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:36,010
comments like,

3797
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:49,710
it's really important out of women,

3798
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:50,850
women comics,

3799
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:56,130
there's probably only 10 ever that are
really funny and you're one of them.

3800
01:42:57,690 --> 01:42:58,151
You know?

3801
01:42:58,151 --> 01:42:58,984
That's crazy.

3802
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:02,080
How many women even had been funny ever

3803
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:07,523
being a dickhead?

3804
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:07,811
Let's say.

3805
01:43:07,811 --> 01:43:08,644
We can think of a bunch right now.

3806
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:10,280
Felicia,

3807
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,170
Michael's,

3808
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:12,813
Joan Rivers,

3809
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:13,973
rivers.

3810
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:16,063
There's a bunch of

3811
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:19,060
fucking hilarious.

3812
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:20,950
She's fucking hilarious.

3813
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:22,240
That girl does not get her do

3814
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,190
really funny.

3815
01:43:25,191 --> 01:43:25,871
That'll shock you.

3816
01:43:25,871 --> 01:43:26,704
Go see her.

3817
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:28,600
There's a bunch of
girls we never heard of.

3818
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,440
I'm sure.

3819
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:29,891
I'm sure.

3820
01:43:29,891 --> 01:43:30,724
But how many

3821
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:33,740
countries there?

3822
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:36,890
A hundred I now

3823
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:40,543
know that are good.

3824
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:41,803
Seven.

3825
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:44,883
Seven.

3826
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:48,400
That's a random number

3827
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:52,750
we judging funny because Rocky Lynn,

3828
01:43:52,751 --> 01:43:53,660
I know you're funny.

3829
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:54,494
You're funny.

3830
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,700
Funny he said,

3831
01:43:55,701 --> 01:43:55,911
but,

3832
01:43:55,911 --> 01:43:56,580
but he was like,

3833
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:57,050
like,

3834
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:57,350
I was like,

3835
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,471
oh,

3836
01:43:57,471 --> 01:43:59,690
how was his set like to
ask you about a comic?

3837
01:43:59,691 --> 01:43:59,931
And he goes,

3838
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:00,764
he kills.

3839
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:01,340
And I'm like,

3840
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:01,521
yeah,

3841
01:44:01,521 --> 01:44:02,151
what was he funny?

3842
01:44:02,151 --> 01:44:02,480
He goes,

3843
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,190
respect the kill.

3844
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,151
And I was like,

3845
01:44:05,151 --> 01:44:05,984
okay,

3846
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:09,260
Somebody's lame that is killing
and so many land that's bombing.

3847
01:44:09,261 --> 01:44:12,050
I'd way rather have
somebody that's doing well.

3848
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:15,800
You can watch a tell like kind of bomb
once in a while and you're still like,

3849
01:44:15,801 --> 01:44:18,740
this is the funniest shit I've ever
seen in my life where he's just always

3850
01:44:18,741 --> 01:44:20,240
fucking around and
coming up with new shit,

3851
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,113
you know,

3852
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:21,860
if he wanted to.

3853
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:25,190
But it's always hold at classics
and just slaughter isn't,

3854
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:25,401
oh,

3855
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:26,480
he's so fucking funny.

3856
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:27,261
Well,

3857
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,094
it's another way.

3858
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:28,610
He's,

3859
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:29,421
he's a real comic,

3860
01:44:29,421 --> 01:44:30,200
you know,

3861
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,000
there's not so many like real comics.

3862
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,730
There's a lot of like weird people
that you have to hang out with.

3863
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:35,720
Why you're doing real comedy.

3864
01:44:35,721 --> 01:44:37,160
Like the guy who was one of the actors,

3865
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,950
the guy was opening for the annoying
to what you were just talking about

3866
01:44:39,951 --> 01:44:40,550
earlier,

3867
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:41,383
who

3868
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:43,330
you'll enjoy them,

3869
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:45,260
enjoy them.

3870
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:46,610
That's not a real cup of coffee.

3871
01:44:46,611 --> 01:44:47,230
Coffee.

3872
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:47,831
That guy's a dick.

3873
01:44:47,831 --> 01:44:48,664
Wad

3874
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,073
totaling up.

3875
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:51,680
No,

3876
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,360
he was probably 45

3877
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:56,173
even better

3878
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:59,510
older guys that are
featuring and then I'm like,

3879
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:00,443
Ooh,

3880
01:45:00,690 --> 01:45:01,060
Ooh.

3881
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:01,680
It's like,

3882
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,031
yeah man,

3883
01:45:02,031 --> 01:45:02,480
you're great.

3884
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,130
Then the more they like
say they support you,

3885
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,150
the more you just see the venom.

3886
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:05,630
Like,

3887
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:05,811
no,

3888
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:06,280
you're great.

3889
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,113
Yeah,

3890
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:08,683
my kids love you.

3891
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:09,470
You're like,

3892
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:11,000
you want me to die in the parking lot?

3893
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:14,510
There's always those weird older dudes
used to be at the store that always used

3894
01:45:14,511 --> 01:45:15,344
to give the vet.

3895
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:18,920
Those guys that have been around a long
time and they could barely feature on

3896
01:45:18,921 --> 01:45:19,370
the road.

3897
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:22,300
They barely even featured
on the road to success.

3898
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:24,200
You're really successful,

3899
01:45:24,201 --> 01:45:25,080
but people don't,

3900
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:26,270
people aren't mad at you.

3901
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:29,403
Well,

3902
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,060
I guess I'm in New York,

3903
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:33,710
but I never hear of anybody hating on you.

3904
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:35,593
Pretty Nice,

3905
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,720
but people are nice that still just get
shit because people are upset about it.

3906
01:45:40,721 --> 01:45:41,554
There was

3907
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,450
an opportunity to talk.

3908
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:45,650
When you're talking on the podcast,

3909
01:45:45,651 --> 01:45:48,030
people get a chance to
like if you see somebody,

3910
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:48,191
yeah,

3911
01:45:48,191 --> 01:45:49,240
you see somebody in a movie,

3912
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,251
fuck that guy.

3913
01:45:52,251 --> 01:45:53,150
That guy's a piece of shit.

3914
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:02,050
Fear factor when,

3915
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:02,890
but when you,

3916
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:04,130
you see a person,

3917
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:06,020
like a podcast allows you like,

3918
01:46:06,021 --> 01:46:06,440
okay,

3919
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,860
I see like no,

3920
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:09,050
I'm not no perfect person.

3921
01:46:09,051 --> 01:46:09,861
There's no perfect person,

3922
01:46:09,861 --> 01:46:10,850
but I'm not a bad guy.

3923
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:14,600
I tried to be nice many as often as I can.

3924
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:16,760
It's like as many opportunities
to be nice as possible.

3925
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,623
I try to take,

3926
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:20,180
but you're always going to get
someone who doesn't like yet.

3927
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:23,660
There's always going to be people that
are haters no matter what they look at

3928
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:27,290
you or the movement of hate toward
you ever at all from anyone.

3929
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,153
Well that's sweet.

3930
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:29,413
Thank you.

3931
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,440
Thanks for now.

3932
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,000
I'm sure someone out
there will prove me wrong,

3933
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,640
but now

3934
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:38,510
you're in the public and someone
is always going to hate you,

3935
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:39,471
but not comics.

3936
01:46:39,471 --> 01:46:41,750
I think we all like care about
what comics think about us and

3937
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:45,020
jealousy and whatever.

3938
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:47,630
But yeah,

3939
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:49,693
uh,

3940
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:50,581
people were like,

3941
01:46:50,581 --> 01:46:50,651
yeah,

3942
01:46:50,651 --> 01:46:51,120
for sure.

3943
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:51,341
I'm like,

3944
01:46:51,341 --> 01:46:52,150
watch them again.

3945
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:52,840
You'd be surprised.

3946
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:53,410
Yeah.

3947
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:54,010
Yeah.

3948
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:58,090
Well I definitely got that like from the
people that were like comedy purist or

3949
01:46:58,091 --> 01:46:58,480
so,

3950
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:02,560
but it's also because I was
always considered dirty and
for a long time that was

3951
01:47:02,561 --> 01:47:03,250
bad.

3952
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:03,581
Like,

3953
01:47:03,581 --> 01:47:03,910
um,

3954
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:07,780
when I first started out there was
a bad distinction that was being,

3955
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:07,961
oh,

3956
01:47:07,961 --> 01:47:08,321
he's got it.

3957
01:47:08,321 --> 01:47:09,310
He's a dirty comic.

3958
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:10,383
Like,

3959
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:11,171
Oh yeah,

3960
01:47:11,171 --> 01:47:12,004
for sure.

3961
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:14,350
You were cheap and you were,

3962
01:47:14,351 --> 01:47:14,870
um,

3963
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:15,880
you were going for cheap.

3964
01:47:15,881 --> 01:47:16,810
Why would they say that?

3965
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:17,350
Well,

3966
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:20,950
because first of all it was Boston and
it's kind of conservative a little bit

3967
01:47:20,951 --> 01:47:22,900
socially and it was also that,

3968
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,230
you know,

3969
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:24,063
although the very edge,

3970
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,710
it was also fairly conservative socially.

3971
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:31,740
And it's also that they had just this
movement and just sort of taking place

3972
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:34,380
where people had gotten the tonight
show and then gotten famous.

3973
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,680
It happened with teddy birds,

3974
01:47:35,681 --> 01:47:36,310
Ron,

3975
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:39,540
it happened with Steven Wright in a big
way and that they had gotten on these

3976
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:43,300
shows and gotten like this
public attention from television.

3977
01:47:43,301 --> 01:47:44,410
So everybody had a nice,

3978
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:46,060
had to have a nice television set.

3979
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:47,560
So the clean people got successful.

3980
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:47,980
Then you became,

3981
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:48,910
when you started thinking like,

3982
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:51,070
well that means they should get success.

3983
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:53,800
Clean equals like [inaudible] was good.

3984
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:54,250
Yeah,

3985
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:54,601
cleaning.

3986
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:58,630
It was good and dirty equals and I
was so confused because I was like,

3987
01:47:58,631 --> 01:47:58,811
well,

3988
01:47:58,811 --> 01:48:00,940
the reason why I got into
comedy is because I like,

3989
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:04,870
like Richard Pryor and I like Sam
Kinison and like the guy goes,

3990
01:48:04,871 --> 01:48:05,081
you know,

3991
01:48:05,081 --> 01:48:05,321
look,

3992
01:48:05,321 --> 01:48:06,880
you're not like this guy
said to me once like,

3993
01:48:06,881 --> 01:48:07,870
you're not dice clay.

3994
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:08,913
I go,

3995
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:09,391
no,

3996
01:48:09,391 --> 01:48:10,000
but,

3997
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,910
but dice clay like became dice clay.

3998
01:48:12,970 --> 01:48:15,940
Like he couldn't have been like really
good when he first started with all these

3999
01:48:15,941 --> 01:48:16,960
great form jokes,

4000
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:19,730
but he had a style that
he enjoyed and like,

4001
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:21,160
I'm pursuing a style that I enjoy.

4002
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,350
But Boston was very suppressive of that.

4003
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,280
They did not.

4004
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:24,551
Yeah,

4005
01:48:24,551 --> 01:48:24,761
no.

4006
01:48:24,761 --> 01:48:25,080
Dot.

4007
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:25,540
Yeah,

4008
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,470
it must be way worse.

4009
01:48:26,471 --> 01:48:29,260
I've always said it's way harder
for a woman to do stand up,

4010
01:48:29,261 --> 01:48:29,711
period.

4011
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:30,670
Because I think that,

4012
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:31,421
first of all,

4013
01:48:31,421 --> 01:48:35,140
there's a lot of bigoted men that don't
want to see a woman in a position of

4014
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:36,220
like the center of attention.

4015
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:37,420
Men don't like that shit.

4016
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:37,780
Yeah.

4017
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:41,380
And they want to be able to like stop
you or a clown you or they'll have their

4018
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:42,011
egos.

4019
01:48:42,011 --> 01:48:42,281
Well,

4020
01:48:42,281 --> 01:48:43,990
I'll force them to say,

4021
01:48:43,991 --> 01:48:44,360
sure,

4022
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:45,640
I want to render you powerless.

4023
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:47,030
When it's why people attack it,

4024
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:49,180
they'll like say something about your
physical appearance because that just

4025
01:48:49,181 --> 01:48:50,590
takes away all your power or something.

4026
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:51,370
Yeah.

4027
01:48:51,370 --> 01:48:52,120
But yeah,

4028
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:57,120
but also girls have way more of an
opportunity because there is a shortage of

4029
01:48:58,090 --> 01:48:59,290
really strong,

4030
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:00,310
um,

4031
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:00,990
working field.

4032
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:01,311
Like when a,

4033
01:49:01,311 --> 01:49:03,390
when a festival comes up or like,

4034
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:04,240
who's a killer?

4035
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:04,421
Like,

4036
01:49:04,421 --> 01:49:04,531
right.

4037
01:49:04,531 --> 01:49:06,760
We will come out here
and just own the room.

4038
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:07,150
Right.

4039
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:07,570
Which,

4040
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:10,990
which requires going on the road
and doing the work for a long time,

4041
01:49:10,991 --> 01:49:12,280
long time and uh,

4042
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,020
and,

4043
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:13,240
and,

4044
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:13,481
yeah.

4045
01:49:13,481 --> 01:49:14,201
And a lot of people,

4046
01:49:14,201 --> 01:49:15,034
it just doesn't get,

4047
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:15,873
get to there.

4048
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:16,813
Yeah.

4049
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:18,330
Yeah.

4050
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:20,910
Like the arrogance that you know,

4051
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:25,500
like a lot of like young comics have
like for a female comic it's a way more

4052
01:49:25,501 --> 01:49:26,520
slippery slope.

4053
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:26,790
Yeah.

4054
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:27,200
Yeah.

4055
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,910
It's really hard to give you a chance.

4056
01:49:28,911 --> 01:49:30,680
What before you're ready girls.

4057
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:31,180
Yeah,

4058
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:31,800
yeah,

4059
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,030
yeah and like the book
rooms ahead of time.

4060
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,000
Totally.

4061
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,620
Because I'm,

4062
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:37,470
because people,

4063
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:41,370
they want to have a woman in the lineup
they want or whatever and that can,

4064
01:49:41,371 --> 01:49:44,190
I mean just me getting on last
comic that early like that.

4065
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:45,600
That was crazy,

4066
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:50,630
but it was like how many were you in
before you got on last calmer to two years

4067
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:52,200
in all my God,

4068
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:56,880
where did you go on John Reape one wait,

4069
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,790
John wrote that was what year?

4070
01:50:00,810 --> 01:50:01,643
What year was this?

4071
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:03,260
I really

4072
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:06,121
had fun.

4073
01:50:06,121 --> 01:50:07,620
Went to was a really tough,

4074
01:50:07,621 --> 01:50:08,950
I went to that the first,

4075
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:09,171
second,

4076
01:50:09,171 --> 01:50:11,160
second was third and
then on the first one,

4077
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:18,403
I'm sorry ma'am.

4078
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:18,880
I'm like,

4079
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,370
now I just,

4080
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:21,900
I'm a dick.

4081
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,260
I shot those stories or shows.

4082
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:26,490
It's really nice to see you
have a moment of actual shame.

4083
01:50:26,491 --> 01:50:27,490
I've never seen that.

4084
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:28,890
I liked the guy I liked damn fan.

4085
01:50:28,891 --> 01:50:29,790
I liked that fan too.

4086
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:30,624
He's a nice guy.

4087
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:32,921
Yeah.

4088
01:50:32,921 --> 01:50:33,754
That was the,

4089
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:38,350
that was the first year that they did
last comic standing when they realize that

4090
01:50:38,351 --> 01:50:42,100
all these guys that were also in the
show that made it were also being managed

4091
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:42,934
by the producer.

4092
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:44,110
But cats.

4093
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:44,441
Yeah.

4094
01:50:44,441 --> 01:50:45,161
When everybody was like,

4095
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:45,701
wait a minute,

4096
01:50:45,701 --> 01:50:46,960
what the people that,

4097
01:50:46,961 --> 01:50:47,900
and then when you found out that you,

4098
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:48,170
the,

4099
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:53,170
the voting didn't really count that it
was just sort of a ceremonial voting.

4100
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:59,410
It really didn't matter whether or not
like that's why I drew Carey walked off

4101
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,770
and prep Butler Butler walked off.

4102
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:02,300
Yeah.

4103
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:04,270
Because they found out that
their vote was not really about,

4104
01:51:04,271 --> 01:51:04,511
hey,

4105
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:06,280
we're trying to make a show.

4106
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:09,910
We have the ultimate decision of who's
going to be more entertaining and it just

4107
01:51:09,911 --> 01:51:12,250
so happens that people going
to that are more entertaining.

4108
01:51:12,251 --> 01:51:13,084
I man and

4109
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:13,920
yeah.

4110
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,450
Amy or surprising,

4111
01:51:15,451 --> 01:51:20,330
a lot of paypal and the host and the
host and the host time manage what?

4112
01:51:20,331 --> 01:51:21,360
A cunt face.

4113
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:22,921
Oh God.

4114
01:51:22,921 --> 01:51:25,830
What a fucking a parasite
on the world of comedy.

4115
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:27,683
What do you mean?

4116
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:32,040
Who works with the agencies and
management companies are great people.

4117
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:33,510
Most of them are awesome.

4118
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:37,140
Most of them are all driven by being
proud of how they're living and inspiring

4119
01:51:37,141 --> 01:51:37,650
their kid.

4120
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:38,191
You know it's good.

4121
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:43,191
I have the original pilot of that on
VHS with Doug Stanhope Somebody's house.

4122
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:46,050
It's really hilarious.

4123
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:47,770
Someone else hosted after awhile,

4124
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:48,653
like Bill Bellamy,

4125
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:50,670
the host when I did it.

4126
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:51,150
Wow.

4127
01:51:51,150 --> 01:51:51,781
What happened?

4128
01:51:51,781 --> 01:51:51,951
Why?

4129
01:51:51,951 --> 01:51:52,620
Why Jay Morris?

4130
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:53,453
Stop doing it.

4131
01:51:54,090 --> 01:51:55,500
Trying to freshen it up a little.

4132
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,393
Is that what it was?

4133
01:51:56,790 --> 01:52:01,790
Trying to make it a hundred hyper kids
like black people [inaudible] black

4134
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,500
occasionally like those frowny
ice cube type black people,

4135
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:10,530
but for the most part we'd like
to keep them on the periphery.

4136
01:52:10,531 --> 01:52:11,364
We bring them in.

4137
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:13,411
Bell me,

4138
01:52:13,411 --> 01:52:14,430
it's not scary to me.

4139
01:52:14,431 --> 01:52:15,960
I'll tell you why right now.

4140
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:20,260
Is he back?

4141
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:22,490
I feel like Bill Bellamy's back.

4142
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:26,260
I don't know Bill Bellamy.

4143
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:26,580
Yeah,

4144
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:27,420
I know he's on the road.

4145
01:52:27,421 --> 01:52:28,770
I see like places where like

4146
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:31,021
friends.

4147
01:52:31,021 --> 01:52:31,510
Yeah,

4148
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:32,670
different like jail.

4149
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:33,071
Yeah.

4150
01:52:33,071 --> 01:52:33,820
That's the only way,

4151
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:34,653
you know,

4152
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:37,103
next week

4153
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:39,321
say that.

4154
01:52:39,321 --> 01:52:44,321
But like I love going like weird little
clubs and especially because when I go

4155
01:52:44,451 --> 01:52:45,130
I'll go with like,

4156
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,010
or Brian or

4157
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,210
Dunkin or Joey,

4158
01:52:47,211 --> 01:52:48,560
if you can go with friends.

4159
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:49,843
It's always fun.

4160
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,590
Like I've never had a
bad time in the road.

4161
01:52:51,591 --> 01:52:53,090
I can't remember the Youngstown,

4162
01:52:53,091 --> 01:52:53,930
Ohio was not good

4163
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,393
the last time.

4164
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,780
Was that the one at the
behind the dance club?

4165
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:03,100
Yeah.

4166
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:03,470
Yeah.

4167
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:03,711
Yeah.

4168
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:04,544
That place.

4169
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:06,950
Cleveland's Cleveland's true.

4170
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,810
Chicky because it's
economically challenged.

4171
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:12,860
It's very much so,

4172
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:14,203
yeah.

4173
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:16,090
There's spots where you know,

4174
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,000
kids are growing up.

4175
01:53:17,001 --> 01:53:18,800
We're just no fucking hope in their town.

4176
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:19,663
You know?

4177
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,700
Right now where he goes,

4178
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:23,481
he goes,

4179
01:53:23,481 --> 01:53:25,040
here's a conversation you ever here?

4180
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:26,090
I'm going to Detroit.

4181
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:26,511
Okay.

4182
01:53:26,511 --> 01:53:27,344
Have Fun.

4183
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:28,793
And he said,

4184
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:31,490
yeah,

4185
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:32,660
you just ate up as material

4186
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,140
premise for his next special.

4187
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,313
I'll go to Detroit.

4188
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:41,413
How Fun.

4189
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:42,410
Chad.

4190
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:43,490
He's so fucking funny.

4191
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:49,730
He does Dallas.

4192
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:49,920
Oh,

4193
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:50,753
that's a classic.

4194
01:53:52,230 --> 01:53:54,830
It's impossible to jerk
off to that in 2013

4195
01:53:59,120 --> 01:53:59,990
that was funny.

4196
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,033
I don't remember.

4197
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:02,690
Are you picturing the carwash?

4198
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:09,560
James' old points really fun.

4199
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:10,161
First of all,

4200
01:54:10,161 --> 01:54:10,431
Dave.

4201
01:54:10,431 --> 01:54:10,971
So funny.

4202
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:14,020
Like off the cuff and
heres a bunch erotic.

4203
01:54:14,021 --> 01:54:16,020
He's got like sheets and
sheets of material and he,

4204
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:19,790
he looked pretty watches the porn goes
over stuff and like he really takes it

4205
01:54:19,791 --> 01:54:21,550
super seriously on it.

4206
01:54:21,870 --> 01:54:22,730
And then the accuracy,

4207
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:23,870
super respectful

4208
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:29,210
to talk about these films that
they made that were iconic.

4209
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:29,771
Oh,

4210
01:54:29,771 --> 01:54:31,320
he has them come back on

4211
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:35,720
with Debbie Dallas.

4212
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:42,140
I did it with a Ginger Lynn.

4213
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:43,190
Oh Wow.

4214
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:46,010
Brian,

4215
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:46,843
no sex.

4216
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:52,150
She was on my first ever comedy
album in 1999 she did a like a,

4217
01:54:52,330 --> 01:54:54,020
an introduction to this song that I wrote.

4218
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,590
You just randomly placed together or

4219
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:58,700
I forget how I got in touch with her.

4220
01:54:58,990 --> 01:54:59,661
I think,

4221
01:54:59,661 --> 01:55:00,230
uh,

4222
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:02,060
I think I'd met her through Howard Stern.

4223
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:03,440
I think when I did a,

4224
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:04,520
the Howard stern show,

4225
01:55:04,521 --> 01:55:05,360
I met her on that.

4226
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:06,330
Was it that or did it?

4227
01:55:06,331 --> 01:55:08,090
It was the comedy store
and that's how I met Jen.

4228
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:09,300
Jenna Jamison come,

4229
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:10,880
we'll walk them through
a porn and make a wish.

4230
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:14,180
Say that again if you're calm while
watching her porn and make a wish,

4231
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:15,890
what happens to everybody to
get in touch with somebody?

4232
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:17,301
Is that how it works?

4233
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:18,500
Like a secret used a secret

4234
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:21,463
project.

4235
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:24,320
Amy,

4236
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,840
how do you attribute your hard
work if you didn't use the secret?

4237
01:55:26,841 --> 01:55:27,450
I mean,

4238
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:28,760
how did you attribute the success?

4239
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:31,790
Is that what it is?

4240
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:32,623
I think,

4241
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:36,710
I guess all the pain.

4242
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:39,290
I was funny as a kid though.

4243
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:41,620
Yeah,

4244
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:43,650
but then it was totally
my defense mechanism.

4245
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:43,980
How will you

4246
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,221
funny.

4247
01:55:44,221 --> 01:55:44,510
All right.

4248
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,200
What do you like if someone says,

4249
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:47,123
how are you finding,

4250
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:47,900
what is it?

4251
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:48,540
Let's start.

4252
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:49,380
I used to just do,

4253
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:50,423
uh,

4254
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:50,910
uh,

4255
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:51,930
Eddie Murphy routines,

4256
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,830
pretended they were my own.

4257
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:53,160
Oh,

4258
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,300
my fourth grade.

4259
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:54,730
I'm like,

4260
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:57,330
I tell women to get out of the
car and you can't do that anymore,

4261
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:58,590
these days to kick you out of the car.

4262
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:00,360
And my friends are like,

4263
01:56:00,361 --> 01:56:01,950
that's not your experience at all.

4264
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:02,221
I'm like,

4265
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:02,371
no,

4266
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:03,204
it is.

4267
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:04,490
Draw.

4268
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:08,280
How's driving driving yesterday
you guys weren't even around.

4269
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:08,551
Yeah.

4270
01:56:08,551 --> 01:56:09,001
Then I was like,

4271
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:09,121
oh,

4272
01:56:09,121 --> 01:56:11,130
I think I got a ice on this on my own.

4273
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:14,280
I used to tell my friends
like Richard Pryor routines.

4274
01:56:14,281 --> 01:56:14,670
Yeah.

4275
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:15,840
Sam Kinison routines.

4276
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:16,671
Oh yeah.

4277
01:56:16,671 --> 01:56:17,610
I would like redoing them.

4278
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:18,580
Redoing,

4279
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:19,620
put your own spin on them?

4280
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:20,071
No,

4281
01:56:20,071 --> 01:56:20,311
no,

4282
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:20,491
no.

4283
01:56:20,491 --> 01:56:21,750
Say like the guy did it.

4284
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:24,450
I didn't try to pass them off as
my own when I said like the guy,

4285
01:56:24,451 --> 01:56:25,920
I don't figure that I might've once,

4286
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:26,490
oh no,

4287
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:27,323
I can't remember it.

4288
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:29,500
Heating sand up you,

4289
01:56:29,710 --> 01:56:31,210
you may like maybe the talent for it,

4290
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,260
that rhythm and whatever.

4291
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:32,780
Yeah.

4292
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:34,760
I sometimes um,

4293
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,560
uh,

4294
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:38,230
sat on Youtube where
they're covering my jokes.

4295
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,330
They do that Amy Schumer stuff.

4296
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:40,690
Yeah.

4297
01:56:40,690 --> 01:56:41,141
And My,

4298
01:56:41,141 --> 01:56:41,471
I'm like,

4299
01:56:41,471 --> 01:56:43,180
can you guys have them take that down?

4300
01:56:43,181 --> 01:56:43,480
Like,

4301
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:45,280
and it'll be a girl like butchering it,

4302
01:56:45,281 --> 01:56:45,680
you know,

4303
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,590
just like it's so embarrassing.

4304
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:50,830
They should be able to do that.

4305
01:56:50,831 --> 01:56:53,500
Be like cover bands in
front of an audience.

4306
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:53,721
Yeah.

4307
01:56:53,721 --> 01:56:54,400
Well man,

4308
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:54,760
see Ya.

4309
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:55,900
That was like his whole thing.

4310
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:58,420
Let me use essentially it was just
really good at doing your shit.

4311
01:56:58,480 --> 01:56:59,170
Do they say like,

4312
01:56:59,170 --> 01:56:59,291
oh,

4313
01:56:59,291 --> 01:57:00,041
in front of an audience?

4314
01:57:00,041 --> 01:57:00,970
Not like in front of the camera.

4315
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:01,420
Yeah,

4316
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:01,691
no,

4317
01:57:01,691 --> 01:57:02,920
it's in front of an audience.

4318
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,360
Or they say this an Amy Schumer joke.

4319
01:57:04,361 --> 01:57:04,750
I like,

4320
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:05,320
no,

4321
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,760
they just do it and then they do it.

4322
01:57:06,761 --> 01:57:08,590
But it'll say like,

4323
01:57:08,591 --> 01:57:10,890
you know in the description
like this is Amy.

4324
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:14,080
They don't say it while she's being
interviewed and not like she's about to do

4325
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,430
all of Amy Schumer should.

4326
01:57:15,431 --> 01:57:16,420
She just stole your shit.

4327
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:18,290
I'm like,

4328
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:20,230
can you at least be good at it?

4329
01:57:20,231 --> 01:57:21,100
Can you kill with it?

4330
01:57:21,101 --> 01:57:25,150
But she likes to use for like doing your
shit in front of some strangers because

4331
01:57:25,151 --> 01:57:27,510
the problem is if she
doesn't say it and then they,

4332
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,690
that's a hundred people,

4333
01:57:28,691 --> 01:57:29,340
whoever,

4334
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,310
how many it is,

4335
01:57:30,311 --> 01:57:31,990
who don't know that that's your job.

4336
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:32,470
Right.

4337
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:33,910
And so if you ever go and do it,

4338
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:35,210
I saw those jobs.

4339
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:36,870
That's fucking man,

4340
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:39,460
that shit hole.

4341
01:57:39,490 --> 01:57:41,180
You stole those from Mindy?

4342
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:42,770
Yeah.

4343
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:43,270
Yeah.

4344
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:44,090
It's fucked up.

4345
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:44,241
Yeah.

4346
01:57:44,241 --> 01:57:44,810
I was just like,

4347
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:45,680
I just asked my manager,

4348
01:57:45,681 --> 01:57:47,000
can you get that taken off of Youtube?

4349
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:47,480
Maybe?

4350
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:47,780
No.

4351
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:48,800
Do you remember your lawn?

4352
01:57:48,801 --> 01:57:49,400
Gold?

4353
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:49,531
Yeah,

4354
01:57:49,531 --> 01:57:49,770
I still,

4355
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:50,050
yeah.

4356
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:50,570
Yeah.

4357
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:50,960
Well,

4358
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:51,231
you know,

4359
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:52,310
when he first started,

4360
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:54,050
he does impressions of Comedians.

4361
01:57:54,051 --> 01:57:55,230
He's a really good impression as,

4362
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:57,920
but he wouldn't watch them
who would do a comedians,

4363
01:57:57,921 --> 01:58:01,430
but he would do it with their
material and that people like,

4364
01:58:01,431 --> 01:58:02,264
hey man,

4365
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:03,490
stop fucking doing it.

4366
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:03,871
Yeah,

4367
01:58:03,871 --> 01:58:04,051
no,

4368
01:58:04,051 --> 01:58:04,831
that's not okay.

4369
01:58:04,831 --> 01:58:07,070
You have to be like this is it.

4370
01:58:07,071 --> 01:58:07,650
Yeah.

4371
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:08,760
It was the wizard of Oz.

4372
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:10,440
We did you see the comedian?

4373
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,140
Yes.

4374
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:11,650
What?

4375
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:11,970
What?

4376
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:13,830
I was just going to say the same thing.

4377
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:14,411
Oh No,

4378
01:58:14,411 --> 01:58:14,570
no,

4379
01:58:14,570 --> 01:58:14,790
I didn't.

4380
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:15,151
What am I?

4381
01:58:15,151 --> 01:58:16,140
God laughs Penn.

4382
01:58:16,141 --> 01:58:17,760
There's a guy doing an
impression of Louis.

4383
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:18,421
Oh my God.

4384
01:58:18,421 --> 01:58:18,751
It's great.

4385
01:58:18,751 --> 01:58:19,850
Fucking right.

4386
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:21,463
No,

4387
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:22,170
pull it up.

4388
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:22,870
Pull it up.

4389
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:23,520
Pull it.

4390
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,740
He's half black shell.

4391
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:29,450
Half black is black.

4392
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:30,150
Sorry.

4393
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:30,983
Yeah.

4394
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:31,850
Yeah.

4395
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:32,220
Right.

4396
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:32,720
Look at him.

4397
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,390
Leave his face.

4398
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:33,510
Oh,

4399
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:34,430
I'm really snarling.

4400
01:58:34,431 --> 01:58:34,690
He's like,

4401
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:35,091
what have you.

4402
01:58:35,091 --> 01:58:36,050
You're going to make a half black kid.

4403
01:58:36,051 --> 01:58:36,651
That's what we going to do it.

4404
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:37,850
We can fuck that black chicken.

4405
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:38,853
I can see

4406
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:43,020
guys will look like the
hippest Brooklyn cobble pro.

4407
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:44,910
That's the kind of black
Jack I want to go to.

4408
01:58:44,911 --> 01:58:47,370
Like clubs where they
play Brazilian music.

4409
01:58:47,690 --> 01:58:48,950
Putting it out there with the secret.

4410
01:58:48,951 --> 01:58:49,870
You're going to get it already.

4411
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:55,130
So funny.

4412
01:58:55,131 --> 01:58:58,980
He does a commercial for his next special,

4413
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:00,960
it's really funny.

4414
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:02,960
Okay,

4415
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,760
crank it.

4416
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:04,990
He is a modern day.

4417
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:08,170
He is the most original artists.

4418
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:09,790
Since art was invented.

4419
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:14,590
I did write some more material on a
coffee that most comedians right in their

4420
01:59:14,591 --> 01:59:15,424
lifetime,

4421
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:17,883
every hour

4422
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,620
it's filmed his most daring special.

4423
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:25,100
I don't know why the
chicken cross the road.

4424
01:59:25,101 --> 01:59:26,500
I know some sort of doctor.

4425
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:27,660
That's right.

4426
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:32,090
You Louis Ck is retelling all the greatest
classic jokes in only how it looks

4427
01:59:32,091 --> 01:59:32,924
like a

4428
01:59:42,090 --> 01:59:43,480
fucking other chip.

4429
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:50,240
Huffington post declares

4430
01:59:51,970 --> 01:59:52,803
even walks

4431
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:58,223
stupid.

4432
01:59:58,270 --> 01:59:59,103
There's no,

4433
01:59:59,270 --> 02:00:02,510
this is the inevitable backlash
of the avalanche of success.

4434
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:04,730
Louis Ck is experience.

4435
02:00:08,570 --> 02:00:09,530
I don't know.

4436
02:00:09,531 --> 02:00:10,670
Maybe because six

4437
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:18,320
thinks that everything he does is the
greatest in the world and nobody can tell

4438
02:00:18,321 --> 02:00:18,830
him what to do.

4439
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:21,560
So he's all shelter on the wall.

4440
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:25,003
What club is that?

4441
02:00:26,990 --> 02:00:28,420
Where is it?

4442
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,210
Art makes Vishy look like a fucking hat

4443
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:38,973
comedian.

4444
02:00:38,990 --> 02:00:40,400
So what's the name of that place again?

4445
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:42,770
The laughing devil have
often goes into Brooklyn.

4446
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:44,240
He's in New York.

4447
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:44,800
In Brooklyn?

4448
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,410
I think so.

4449
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:45,760
Oh No.

4450
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:46,593
Long Island.

4451
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:47,673
Silly.

4452
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:48,300
Where's that?

4453
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:48,540
Well,

4454
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,050
it's like Brooklyn or Queens.

4455
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:52,910
How many different clubs
are there in New York now?

4456
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:54,050
In 2013.

4457
02:00:55,670 --> 02:00:56,300
Eight.

4458
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:57,650
Eight in the city and the city.

4459
02:00:57,730 --> 02:00:59,150
You know how fucking crazy that is?

4460
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,070
Stop and think about that.

4461
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:05,270
What other city in this God damn
country has eight comedy clubs.

4462
02:01:05,330 --> 02:01:06,980
La doesn't even have any comedy clubs.

4463
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:08,533
Maybe.

4464
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:09,493
What does La have?

4465
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,300
Let's let's look at la in La.

4466
02:01:11,301 --> 02:01:11,661
The city,

4467
02:01:11,661 --> 02:01:12,710
we got the laugh factory.

4468
02:01:12,711 --> 02:01:13,550
We've got the comedy store.

4469
02:01:13,551 --> 02:01:15,530
We got the Improv and then

4470
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:17,500
man,

4471
02:01:17,501 --> 02:01:18,191
when I heard it,

4472
02:01:18,191 --> 02:01:18,260
we're

4473
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:20,300
not pay money.

4474
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:21,620
Pay Money.

4475
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,140
That's not it.

4476
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,020
That's not a real common cause.

4477
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:26,210
That's a place where people who are
scared of real comedy clubs go to cuddle.

4478
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:28,993
They should pay.

4479
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:30,230
I'll be on the record with that.

4480
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:30,800
They should pay.

4481
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:31,633
Should pay,

4482
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,210
pay Jesus Christ.

4483
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:35,720
Um,

4484
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:36,553
um,

4485
02:01:36,770 --> 02:01:37,920
I've been there mixed nuts,

4486
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:38,880
places like that.

4487
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:39,713
Maybe

4488
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:40,350
the,

4489
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:41,150
ha ha ha ha.

4490
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:42,230
Ice Ice House.

4491
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:46,350
Flappers so sex Connie Mack banks.

4492
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:47,680
We're going outside.

4493
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,170
No,

4494
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:50,080
we're outside putting
governors of her though.

4495
02:01:50,090 --> 02:01:50,241
Yeah,

4496
02:01:50,241 --> 02:01:50,661
you're right.

4497
02:01:50,661 --> 02:01:50,991
You're right.

4498
02:01:50,991 --> 02:01:51,450
You're right.

4499
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:52,000
Yeah.

4500
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:52,833
We'll wait.

4501
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:54,710
You can't even include Pasadena then.

4502
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:55,260
No.

4503
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:55,490
Yeah,

4504
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:57,290
we can pull through the ice house.

4505
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:58,333
The seller.

4506
02:01:58,360 --> 02:01:59,151
That's where we have,

4507
02:01:59,151 --> 02:01:59,984
yeah.

4508
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:03,250
What else are we now you're
over that with them now.

4509
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:04,340
I'm sorry.

4510
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:05,190
Already traded.

4511
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,740
I would live in New York.

4512
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,570
You can we give you Joe Derosa?

4513
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:11,300
He's one of my best friends.

4514
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:13,940
I liked New York and I
could live in New York,

4515
02:02:13,941 --> 02:02:16,340
but only if I had a place upstate.

4516
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:17,720
Like I could live,

4517
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:18,561
I could live in New York.

4518
02:02:18,561 --> 02:02:19,570
I know cross does that.

4519
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:21,320
He told me like 50 acres

4520
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:25,730
and acres.

4521
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:26,270
But uh,

4522
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:27,840
there's a lot of people
will do it that way.

4523
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:31,580
They have a place up there where they
can go on the weekend and you go and you

4524
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:33,200
see grass and you hear birds,

4525
02:02:33,201 --> 02:02:33,351
you know,

4526
02:02:33,351 --> 02:02:34,070
like a human.

4527
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:35,420
There's a lake within
a mile of your house,

4528
02:02:35,421 --> 02:02:35,601
you know,

4529
02:02:35,601 --> 02:02:36,260
that kind of shit.

4530
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:36,650
Yeah.

4531
02:02:36,650 --> 02:02:37,820
That's a dope way to do it.

4532
02:02:38,230 --> 02:02:38,360
Yeah.

4533
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:39,350
My manager has a place,

4534
02:02:39,351 --> 02:02:40,340
I want to say what island,

4535
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,640
but he goes out there and
goes fishing and such,

4536
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:43,950
so shut up,

4537
02:02:43,951 --> 02:02:44,784
bitch,

4538
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:46,430
fucking ruin everything.

4539
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,820
He has his place on an island
and he has to go there.

4540
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:50,810
Like there's no cars.

4541
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:54,890
He goes there that everyone rides bikes
around and he goes there by ferry and

4542
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:57,440
then he has a house there that he
goes to and this fucking nothing.

4543
02:02:57,441 --> 02:02:58,101
It's just chirp.

4544
02:02:58,101 --> 02:02:58,934
Chirp.

4545
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:01,010
Not really.

4546
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:01,550
Okay.

4547
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:02,383
Fire,

4548
02:03:04,490 --> 02:03:05,211
fire island.

4549
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:05,451
Yes.

4550
02:03:05,451 --> 02:03:06,830
He's on fire a little bit.

4551
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:08,240
He doesn't even have to
be gay to go to firearms.

4552
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:08,601
I know.

4553
02:03:08,601 --> 02:03:10,070
I've been there and it's a blast.

4554
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:10,850
I'm gonna say it.

4555
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:11,683
We'll have to be gay.

4556
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:13,550
I have to get out of here.

4557
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:14,960
Get Out of here because I love you guys.

4558
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:15,853
Please let the function.

4559
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:16,461
Can I get a hug?

4560
02:03:16,461 --> 02:03:17,660
Come over here because I want a hug.

4561
02:03:17,710 --> 02:03:19,540
We're going to wrap this up with you.

4562
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:23,440
Ari and I will continue to
talk for another five minutes
about you while they're

4563
02:03:23,441 --> 02:03:23,890
hugging.

4564
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:27,670
I'll just say that this Friday I'm at
the empower bullshit fear with Joe Rogan

4565
02:03:27,671 --> 02:03:28,331
and Bill Burrs,

4566
02:03:28,331 --> 02:03:29,440
my farewell to Los Angeles.

4567
02:03:29,441 --> 02:03:34,441
I love Ari Shaffir so much that I'm
flying in for the show and then I'm taking

4568
02:03:35,771 --> 02:03:37,400
the car to the Improv.

4569
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,553
Good and that hug.

4570
02:03:39,610 --> 02:03:40,443
Yeah,

4571
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:41,453

4572
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:42,350

4573
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:42,960
Is it up?

4574
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:43,793
Fill it

4575
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:46,140
up so much.

4576
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,270
You're a,

4577
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:49,130

4578
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:49,420
uh,

4579
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:50,890
what happened on America's got talent?

4580
02:03:50,891 --> 02:03:51,400
Hold on.

4581
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,480
Before you get into that,

4582
02:03:52,481 --> 02:03:55,540

4583
02:03:55,541 --> 02:04:00,541

10 30 Tuesday at 10 30 and 30.

4584
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:02,260
You know what that means?

4585
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:03,080
It means you're edgy.

4586
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:03,191
No.

4587
02:04:03,191 --> 02:04:03,731
Like she said,

4588
02:04:03,731 --> 02:04:03,911
she,

4589
02:04:03,911 --> 02:04:04,081
she,

4590
02:04:04,081 --> 02:04:05,730
she was right after a new tosh.

4591
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:06,720
Edgy.

4592
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:07,180
That's good.

4593
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:08,290
That's a perfect spot.

4594
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,430
That's pretty bad ass.

4595
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:10,751
God Damn,

4596
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:12,010
that's an awesome spot for you.

4597
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:13,090
Congratulations.

4598
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:13,570
Thanks.

4599
02:04:13,570 --> 02:04:14,770
We were supporting the fuck out of you.

4600
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:15,550
All right.

4601
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:16,383
Come back again.

4602
02:04:16,420 --> 02:04:17,253
All right.

4603
02:04:17,410 --> 02:04:19,870
Don't get too big for
your Britches for us.

4604
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:21,533
Oh wait,

4605
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:25,210
I'm saying don't cause I don't
mean to say that for a girl,

4606
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:25,631
a girl.

4607
02:04:25,631 --> 02:04:26,464
You can't say that.

4608
02:04:26,650 --> 02:04:26,951
A Guy,

4609
02:04:26,951 --> 02:04:28,900
you can say you don't get too
big for your britches and they,

4610
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,201
they're like,

4611
02:04:29,201 --> 02:04:29,860
I got it.

4612
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:30,210
Yeah,

4613
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:30,561
that's it.

4614
02:04:30,561 --> 02:04:30,920
Girl.

4615
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:31,130
Joe,

4616
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:34,360
did you hear what happened on a America's
got talent or the guy that stole

4617
02:04:34,361 --> 02:04:34,990
material?

4618
02:04:34,990 --> 02:04:35,160
Great.

4619
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:35,850
Yeah,

4620
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:36,970
the Greg Wilson.

4621
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:38,340
Apparently he stole

4622
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:43,020
a bit and it just so happens that
the guy's bit was the a warm guy.

4623
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:44,063
Yeah.

4624
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:45,680
Yeah,

4625
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,870
it's the original game guy was frank.

4626
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,510
Nick tr zero.

4627
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:50,413
Yeah.

4628
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:51,290
And uh,

4629
02:04:51,530 --> 02:04:53,450
I guess it's really ridiculous.

4630
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:54,350
Well,

4631
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:54,890
you know,

4632
02:04:54,890 --> 02:04:57,040
apparently here's what bothered me more.

4633
02:04:57,041 --> 02:04:58,120
I was talking to a boat show about it.

4634
02:04:58,720 --> 02:04:59,000
Greg.

4635
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,130
I've never heard anything about that.

4636
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:00,720
Really.

4637
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:01,553
Joey Joe,

4638
02:05:01,570 --> 02:05:02,590
he told me it doesn't really.

4639
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:03,513
Yeah.

4640
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:04,330
Uh,

4641
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:07,930
but the problem is when anybody does a
bit like how about we all notice this and

4642
02:05:07,931 --> 02:05:08,171
it's like,

4643
02:05:08,171 --> 02:05:08,920
yeah,

4644
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:09,680
we have,

4645
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:09,880
right?

4646
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:12,760
So if some guy who's going to
start calming seven years from now,

4647
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,170
he's also going to notice to
think he thought of it too.

4648
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:15,460
Yeah.

4649
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,293
Something similar.

4650
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:18,460
What bothered me more
was Freaknik Tero said,

4651
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,980
I've been doing this for
15 years and we're like,

4652
02:05:20,981 --> 02:05:21,814
what?

4653
02:05:22,690 --> 02:05:24,310
15 years?

4654
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:26,380
Shoot yourself.

4655
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,510
Stop.

4656
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:28,390
So in that bit,

4657
02:05:28,391 --> 02:05:28,720
yeah.

4658
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:29,650
What are you doing?

4659
02:05:29,651 --> 02:05:29,861
Okay.

4660
02:05:29,861 --> 02:05:30,131
No,

4661
02:05:30,131 --> 02:05:31,150
thievery is never good,

4662
02:05:31,151 --> 02:05:32,560
but what are you doing?

4663
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:35,290
He's going Catskill style.

4664
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:36,670
Not doing it every day.

4665
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:37,001
You know,

4666
02:05:37,001 --> 02:05:40,900
like maybe he's been doing it
for hopefully fun crowd warmup.

4667
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,250
But let's be honest,

4668
02:05:42,251 --> 02:05:45,220
a lot of those guys that wind
up with that kind of act,

4669
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:47,020
they do keep going like this.

4670
02:05:47,230 --> 02:05:51,040
We know those guys that don't get like
TV spots and not on comedy central that

4671
02:05:51,041 --> 02:05:51,970
do the same act.

4672
02:05:51,971 --> 02:05:52,070
Yeah,

4673
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:56,170
and they were like middle acts and they
tour round like with the lesser roast.

4674
02:05:56,450 --> 02:05:57,290
Yeah.

4675
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:58,520
It's just keep that going.

4676
02:05:58,640 --> 02:05:59,061
Listen,

4677
02:05:59,061 --> 02:06:00,140
when I went to go buy to think,

4678
02:06:00,141 --> 02:06:00,410
right,

4679
02:06:00,410 --> 02:06:01,250
like you could get a Mac,

4680
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:02,420
got your lifestyle.

4681
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,320
I'm still thinks she went
and won't put his act on Hbo.

4682
02:06:06,710 --> 02:06:09,090
You know that because
then you lose your rank.

4683
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:13,783
There's a lot of good jokes.

4684
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:14,541
He won't,

4685
02:06:14,541 --> 02:06:16,280
he won't put it on a a special,

4686
02:06:16,281 --> 02:06:18,830
he doesn't release any material
and think about Jay Leno.

4687
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:22,730
Jay Leno has been a standup for a long
time and my friend continues to stand up.

4688
02:06:22,731 --> 02:06:23,180
He doesn't,

4689
02:06:23,180 --> 02:06:24,680
my friends in San Francisco just saw him.

4690
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:27,020
He was just at a corporate event.

4691
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,093
What they think of him.

4692
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:29,630
They thought he was okay,

4693
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:33,080
but apparently some people said that
he was a a little bit too risque,

4694
02:06:33,081 --> 02:06:34,670
which is hilarious.

4695
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:35,631
I was like,

4696
02:06:35,631 --> 02:06:36,710
what are you even saying?

4697
02:06:36,711 --> 02:06:38,720
I don't even know what the fuck
words just came out of your mouth.

4698
02:06:38,870 --> 02:06:39,830
A little too risky,

4699
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:41,330
but he's doing the same shit.

4700
02:06:41,331 --> 02:06:41,541
I mean,

4701
02:06:41,541 --> 02:06:43,070
he can write jokes if he wants,

4702
02:06:43,071 --> 02:06:47,270
but if you stop and think about the
amount of people that have cds and like,

4703
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:50,630
like think about like what does that,

4704
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:53,210
I see just the guy saying,

4705
02:06:53,211 --> 02:06:57,440
I saw frank do that muted fighting couple
bit 15 years ago with the Ice House in

4706
02:06:57,441 --> 02:06:58,040
Pasadena.

4707
02:06:58,040 --> 02:06:59,840
It was his closer and it killed.

4708
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:00,171
Oh,

4709
02:07:00,171 --> 02:07:02,210
that's what someone said
when the guy was on TV.

4710
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:03,203
Yeah.

4711
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:04,073
Um,

4712
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:05,280
yeah,

4713
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,113
just the fuck on.

4714
02:07:08,570 --> 02:07:11,850
I would say that if television
at all respect Stanhope,

4715
02:07:11,990 --> 02:07:13,880
which at this point we
all know they don't,

4716
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:15,073
they clearly don't.

4717
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:16,550
If they had all respect to stand up,

4718
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:18,620
they wouldn't pass the
guy to the next round.

4719
02:07:18,830 --> 02:07:19,730
That was the first reaction.

4720
02:07:19,731 --> 02:07:19,881
I'm like,

4721
02:07:19,881 --> 02:07:20,151
well,

4722
02:07:20,151 --> 02:07:20,511
it was funny.

4723
02:07:20,511 --> 02:07:21,830
We'll get into a patsy the next round.

4724
02:07:22,110 --> 02:07:22,401
It's like,

4725
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:22,531
no,

4726
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:22,831
no way.

4727
02:07:22,831 --> 02:07:23,601
They pass something.

4728
02:07:23,601 --> 02:07:24,630
That controversy alone,

4729
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:24,970
she said,

4730
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:25,071
well,

4731
02:07:25,071 --> 02:07:26,570
we can't take you until
we have this worked out.

4732
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:27,990
Oh.

4733
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:29,370
But I thought they
kicked him off the show.

4734
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:32,550
Then I think later that frank was so
mad and then they kept talking about it.

4735
02:07:32,551 --> 02:07:32,731
They're like,

4736
02:07:32,731 --> 02:07:32,941
okay,

4737
02:07:32,941 --> 02:07:33,570
let's just not,

4738
02:07:33,570 --> 02:07:34,320
let's just not,

4739
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:34,501
well,

4740
02:07:34,501 --> 02:07:36,310
I think they didn't
know that it was stolen

4741
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:37,720
until he was actually doing it.

4742
02:07:37,721 --> 02:07:39,140
And then while he was doing it,

4743
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:43,240
the warm up guy came over to the producers
and was talking to them and was in

4744
02:07:43,241 --> 02:07:44,860
fee and it was thinking
of interrupting it.

4745
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:45,340
Yeah.

4746
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:47,020
So for them to pass him or to say,

4747
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:48,250
well will pass you for now,

4748
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:48,521
like,

4749
02:07:48,521 --> 02:07:49,750
like Howard stern was there too,

4750
02:07:49,751 --> 02:07:50,260
right?

4751
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:50,710
Yeah.

4752
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:50,980
Uh,

4753
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,910
they would have had to just say,

4754
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:52,151
okay,

4755
02:07:52,151 --> 02:07:55,330
we're going to overlook what we
think may very well be the truth.

4756
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:57,100
We're just gonna overlook
it because you did well.

4757
02:07:57,580 --> 02:07:58,000
Well,

4758
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,130
if you say you've never heard,

4759
02:07:59,140 --> 02:07:59,291
see,

4760
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:01,480
I don't know anything
about the dude's act.

4761
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,240
The Greg when he calls
himself the Greg Wilson.

4762
02:08:04,250 --> 02:08:04,780
Yeah.

4763
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:06,370
I don't know anything about it.

4764
02:08:06,371 --> 02:08:06,521
Sorry.

4765
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:08,320
I've literally never seen him.

4766
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:09,550
I didn't recognize him.

4767
02:08:09,551 --> 02:08:11,080
I've never heard a word out of his mouth,

4768
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:13,690
but so I can't say.

4769
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:14,350
Yeah,

4770
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:15,183
so I haven't,

4771
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:19,030
but Joey told me that he heard the guy
was a thief and that he cleaned up his

4772
02:08:19,031 --> 02:08:19,820
act like immediate,

4773
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:21,580
been a thief at one point in
time and clean up his act.

4774
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:23,830
But that could be a bullshit rumor too.

4775
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:24,560
It's like if,

4776
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,050
if the guy doesn't have a reputation,

4777
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:28,570
if you're saying he doesn't and
he's driving to La all the time,

4778
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:33,420
it is kind of possible that two guys
could have a super similar premise and now

4779
02:08:33,421 --> 02:08:36,160
going to say what both went down the
same exact road and went to the same

4780
02:08:36,161 --> 02:08:36,611
places.

4781
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:36,941
Maybe,

4782
02:08:36,941 --> 02:08:37,950
but it wasn't watching it.

4783
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,730
It wasn't like what does
it is exact version.

4784
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:41,980
His version and the ritual.

4785
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:42,833
Yeah,

4786
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:43,650
you do.

4787
02:08:43,650 --> 02:08:44,483
Okay.

4788
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:45,820
You little bitch.

4789
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:47,111
Okay.

4790
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:48,520
So we're going to watch right now.

4791
02:08:48,521 --> 02:08:49,390
This is the uh,

4792
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:54,510
supposedly original Frank Nikki Taro
and this guy and a girl car fight.

4793
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:56,110
It's called.

4794
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:56,943
Yeah.

4795
02:08:57,370 --> 02:08:58,300
So for 15 years,

4796
02:08:58,301 --> 02:09:00,220
just think better be home
like a Samurai sword.

4797
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:02,470
Every flight hit a car
between a guy and a girl.

4798
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:03,080
Sit back.

4799
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:03,913
Enjoy.

4800
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:04,601
Okay.

4801
02:09:04,601 --> 02:09:06,550
So he's doing his impression
of where he sits on the stool

4802
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:09,400
for the folks on iTunes.

4803
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:09,830
People on,

4804
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:11,330
usually like I can see some real,

4805
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:14,890
I'm starting off as the
guy who's driving that.

4806
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:15,740
I'll become the girl.

4807
02:09:15,741 --> 02:09:16,730
Did I make that clear?

4808
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:19,790
Do you guys need cliff
notes with this shit?

4809
02:09:19,791 --> 02:09:22,490
Are you saying you guys aren't Ucla?

4810
02:09:22,491 --> 02:09:22,881
Come on,

4811
02:09:22,881 --> 02:09:23,830
you're loyal and Mariana.

4812
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:25,491
Oh No,

4813
02:09:25,491 --> 02:09:26,324
he did.

4814
02:09:27,050 --> 02:09:28,160
I started off as the guy.

4815
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:31,090
I don't get that shot.

4816
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:36,710
Yeah,

4817
02:09:36,710 --> 02:09:37,451
he's a guy going,

4818
02:09:37,451 --> 02:09:38,170
what?

4819
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:38,331
Oh,

4820
02:09:38,331 --> 02:09:38,650
I get it.

4821
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:39,191
It's in the car.

4822
02:09:39,191 --> 02:09:39,970
So you can't see.

4823
02:09:39,970 --> 02:09:40,803
Right.

4824
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:41,381
That's the idea.

4825
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:42,490
So he's doing what?

4826
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:44,180
He's doing all this shit.

4827
02:09:44,181 --> 02:09:45,070
It gives it a finger.

4828
02:09:45,071 --> 02:09:46,240
He's going crazy.

4829
02:09:51,370 --> 02:09:51,730
Okay.

4830
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:53,120
Now I could say he's doing,

4831
02:09:53,690 --> 02:09:55,270
I haven't seen the other guys.

4832
02:09:55,271 --> 02:09:55,510
Yeah,

4833
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:56,343
Greg's yet.

4834
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:59,590
They can't say this is easily
something that anyone could think of.

4835
02:09:59,640 --> 02:09:59,740
Oh,

4836
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:01,720
it's when you see a couple of
getting into a fight and call.

4837
02:10:01,730 --> 02:10:01,940
Yeah,

4838
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:02,200
yeah.

4839
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:02,620
Oh yeah,

4840
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:03,453
absolutely.

4841
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:04,540
Well,

4842
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:05,530
it's just a bunch of like,

4843
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:06,730
this guy turns on the rate.

4844
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,560
This guy turns on the radio to ignore her.

4845
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:09,453
Yeah.

4846
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:11,080
And he keeps getting really,

4847
02:10:11,081 --> 02:10:12,160
really upset by himself.

4848
02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:13,660
It's really boring.

4849
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:17,200
He doesn't go for the ice
on the ground right now.

4850
02:10:17,201 --> 02:10:19,600
He's doing the girl and now he's like,

4851
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:22,120
I was giving me the finger.

4852
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:24,250
I didn't notice it the first
time he had to push his finger.

4853
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,020
That's one thing.

4854
02:10:25,020 --> 02:10:25,853
Or like girls do.

4855
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:27,850
They don't even know how to do it right.

4856
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:30,640
But it's basically a bunch
of like mimicking that.

4857
02:10:30,641 --> 02:10:31,200
You're upset.

4858
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:31,550
All right.

4859
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:31,900
All right.

4860
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:32,051
Now,

4861
02:10:32,051 --> 02:10:33,240
have you seen this before?

4862
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:33,891
All right,

4863
02:10:33,891 --> 02:10:36,590
so does he do any like particular cues?

4864
02:10:36,591 --> 02:10:37,570
That would be something that

4865
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:37,910
like,

4866
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:38,151
all right,

4867
02:10:38,151 --> 02:10:40,580
he pulled out of that turning
on the radio to drown her out,

4868
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:41,000
right?

4869
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:41,241
No,

4870
02:10:41,241 --> 02:10:41,991
it's not in the second one.

4871
02:10:41,991 --> 02:10:42,231
Okay,

4872
02:10:42,231 --> 02:10:42,681
let's see.

4873
02:10:42,681 --> 02:10:43,580
The other guys now.

4874
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:43,821
Well,

4875
02:10:43,821 --> 02:10:44,420
I get it.

4876
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:45,530
I get what this guy said.

4877
02:10:45,531 --> 02:10:46,890
There's no joke.

4878
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:50,150
He would cross and they both go to like,

4879
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:52,150
I think it might both go to like a beach.

4880
02:10:52,151 --> 02:10:52,984
I at the end.

4881
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:53,651
Oh,

4882
02:10:53,651 --> 02:10:54,880
willing maybe,

4883
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:56,130
but there's no crime.

4884
02:10:56,530 --> 02:10:59,060
There's crime to get all the details.

4885
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:01,713
It was pretty boring.

4886
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:03,620
He did this for 15 fucking union.

4887
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:04,381
All right.

4888
02:11:04,381 --> 02:11:06,080
So now they're like still
arguing back and forth.

4889
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:06,953
Okay.

4890
02:11:07,140 --> 02:11:08,490
I've skipped ahead a little bit.

4891
02:11:10,230 --> 02:11:12,120
It's basically for the
folks listening to this.

4892
02:11:12,121 --> 02:11:14,880
This is fucking Twitter trophy
on the screen at the same time.

4893
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:15,830
No,

4894
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:16,380
no.

4895
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:17,310
Get them both done with.

4896
02:11:17,790 --> 02:11:18,121
All right,

4897
02:11:18,121 --> 02:11:20,960
so it looks like the
girl and the guy do that.

4898
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,380
Someone would make us put screen.

4899
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:26,890
Imagine if like he exactly
copies every movement.

4900
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:27,733
Every movement.

4901
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,820
That would be easier.

4902
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:30,023
Chateau.

4903
02:11:30,650 --> 02:11:34,020
You could shadow over it
and the guy's honking and

4904
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:38,850
people go around.

4905
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:39,683
I think,

4906
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:40,550
I don't know.

4907
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:42,390
He's leaning over it that Greg doesn't do.

4908
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:44,431
Okay.

4909
02:11:44,431 --> 02:11:44,880
Come on.

4910
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:45,713
I can't do this.

4911
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,030
This is death.

4912
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:51,430
Scroll to the very end and
it showed the blowjob part.

4913
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:52,283
Yeah.

4914
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:54,011
Okay.

4915
02:11:54,011 --> 02:11:54,844
It's coming.

4916
02:11:57,690 --> 02:11:58,141
He says,

4917
02:11:58,141 --> 02:11:58,740
come on.

4918
02:11:58,740 --> 02:11:59,340
Come on.

4919
02:11:59,340 --> 02:11:59,750
Whoa.

4920
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:00,583
What's that?

4921
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:02,000
Okay.

4922
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:02,610
Okay.

4923
02:12:02,610 --> 02:12:03,120
Okay.

4924
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:03,953
God Damn.

4925
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:04,771
Oh,

4926
02:12:04,771 --> 02:12:05,690
maybe it wasn't a coach up.

4927
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:06,810
Maybe just put his hand on her.

4928
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:08,633
He put her hand on

4929
02:12:09,010 --> 02:12:14,010
[inaudible].

4930
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:15,690
Oh yeah.

4931
02:12:15,690 --> 02:12:19,020
He acted like he acted like

4932
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:20,650
put your head down to give a blow job.

4933
02:12:21,390 --> 02:12:22,223
Jeremy Hall.

4934
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:22,820
Jeremy House.

4935
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:22,960
Oh,

4936
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:23,550
enjoy Jeremy.

4937
02:12:23,550 --> 02:12:23,681
Oh,

4938
02:12:23,681 --> 02:12:24,330
he was middling.

4939
02:12:24,330 --> 02:12:24,670
Okay,

4940
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:27,270
so now here is Great Wilson's.

4941
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:30,270
They'll smash brothers
must love this coverage.

4942
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,700
They got their sign in the back.

4943
02:12:33,190 --> 02:12:34,023
Twins.

4944
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:53,803
That's funny.

4945
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:04,641
Same thing.

4946
02:13:04,641 --> 02:13:05,131
Exactly.

4947
02:13:05,131 --> 02:13:07,750
Now he's actually be a
little bit more animated.

4948
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:09,370
Greg's kind of wilder

4949
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:12,370
and then he's doing the girl.

4950
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:16,493
She's mocking him.

4951
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:23,970
But here's the thing,

4952
02:13:24,030 --> 02:13:25,320
if he did see that guy,

4953
02:13:25,321 --> 02:13:26,154
do it,

4954
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:28,650
and then it doesn't
matter if it's different.

4955
02:13:28,651 --> 02:13:28,920
Yeah,

4956
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:29,753
he stole it.

4957
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:30,653
Yeah,

4958
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:31,740
but do you know,

4959
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:32,070
how do you

4960
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,550
know this gets some e this could easily
be something that someone else thought

4961
02:13:35,551 --> 02:13:35,890
of.

4962
02:13:35,890 --> 02:13:37,320
It's super possible.

4963
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:38,970
Like here's a perfect example.

4964
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:43,170
I remember when Tony Hinchcliffe the
other day wrote that joke about how the

4965
02:13:43,171 --> 02:13:44,220
pope got on Twitter.

4966
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,153
Yeah.

4967
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,430
It makes sense because the
Twitter just turned seven.

4968
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:47,940
Yeah.

4969
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:49,920
Well turned out someone else
has said that same joke.

4970
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:52,510
I actually told him that.

4971
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:52,751
I was like,

4972
02:13:52,751 --> 02:13:52,811
oh,

4973
02:13:52,811 --> 02:13:53,281
I saw that.

4974
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:54,190
It goes from where it goes.

4975
02:13:54,191 --> 02:13:54,431
I don't know.

4976
02:13:54,431 --> 02:13:55,190
A while ago.

4977
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:55,640
Yes,

4978
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:56,270
no,

4979
02:13:56,270 --> 02:13:57,310
please tell me you didn't just,

4980
02:13:57,390 --> 02:13:57,740
I'm like,

4981
02:13:57,740 --> 02:13:57,891
yeah,

4982
02:13:57,891 --> 02:13:58,520
I think so.

4983
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:01,040
He thought that someone
else stole it from him,

4984
02:14:01,550 --> 02:14:01,941
you know,

4985
02:14:01,941 --> 02:14:02,840
and it was like this and meet.

4986
02:14:02,841 --> 02:14:03,021
Well,

4987
02:14:03,021 --> 02:14:03,440
you know,

4988
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:06,350
well we could say even
though we know it's not true,

4989
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:10,400
but that is the same thing can be said
for your wall bit with them and see a

4990
02:14:10,401 --> 02:14:11,200
thing.

4991
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,580
This is something that a lot
of people don't know about.

4992
02:14:13,581 --> 02:14:15,590
This is kind of crazy crazy thing,

4993
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:18,110
but the wall bit with the
Carlos Admin CF thing,

4994
02:14:18,530 --> 02:14:19,580
when people said that,

4995
02:14:19,581 --> 02:14:19,890
uh,

4996
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:21,020
well who would build the wall?

4997
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:21,860
Mexicans,

4998
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:26,030
that was like always joke with people
don't realize is that when Ari came up

4999
02:14:26,031 --> 02:14:26,864
with that bit,

5000
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:31,220
there wasn't even really a plan to build
a wall where soccer is just starting to

5001
02:14:31,221 --> 02:14:31,760
run.

5002
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:32,930
It was a joke,

5003
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:37,610
like Ari made a fake premise and then
made a joke about a fake premise and then

5004
02:14:37,730 --> 02:14:40,220
through the ridiculousness of real life,

5005
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:45,230
they actually did start proposing that
we build a wall next to Mexico and that's

5006
02:14:45,231 --> 02:14:47,270
when all these dudes start stealing it.

5007
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:48,740
But when our he did it,

5008
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:50,990
he was actually the line about,

5009
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:53,960
that's how I know that
you came up with it first.

5010
02:14:54,150 --> 02:14:54,220
No,

5011
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:54,480
no,

5012
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,170
they don't have that.

5013
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:55,780
Yes.

5014
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:56,690
So what's the problem?

5015
02:14:56,691 --> 02:14:57,051
Really?

5016
02:14:57,051 --> 02:14:57,171
What,

5017
02:14:57,171 --> 02:14:59,180
who also thinks that we
should get a wall of here,

5018
02:14:59,181 --> 02:14:59,600
but then be like,

5019
02:14:59,600 --> 02:14:59,691
oh,

5020
02:14:59,691 --> 02:15:00,290
who would build it?

5021
02:15:00,290 --> 02:15:03,620
It could be a way to go if not from me
seeing him in the back laughing at my

5022
02:15:03,621 --> 02:15:04,030
jokes.

5023
02:15:04,030 --> 02:15:04,340
Well,

5024
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:05,450
not only that,

5025
02:15:05,451 --> 02:15:07,670
he actually did mirror you.

5026
02:15:07,671 --> 02:15:08,540
Exactly.

5027
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:09,950
He mirrored your motions,

5028
02:15:09,951 --> 02:15:10,551
your hands,

5029
02:15:10,551 --> 02:15:11,540
which was like your style.

5030
02:15:11,541 --> 02:15:11,750
Like,

5031
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:12,583
oh

5032
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:14,800
well this kind of looks
like he's marrying the same,

5033
02:15:14,801 --> 02:15:17,830
touching the leg first year
at the very end of the jokes.

5034
02:15:17,831 --> 02:15:21,550
He just went through the whole same shit
and then he's doing the hands and then

5035
02:15:21,710 --> 02:15:22,900
he was like looking over.

5036
02:15:22,901 --> 02:15:23,734
Yeah.

5037
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:24,041
Oh,

5038
02:15:24,041 --> 02:15:24,651
he just looked at,

5039
02:15:24,651 --> 02:15:25,141
we didn't get that.

5040
02:15:25,141 --> 02:15:26,170
He didn't do the blowjob part.

5041
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:26,381
No,

5042
02:15:26,381 --> 02:15:27,270
he just looked over it.

5043
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:28,710
We did a hand light touch.

5044
02:15:28,770 --> 02:15:29,800
All touched his leg.

5045
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:30,101
Yeah.

5046
02:15:30,101 --> 02:15:30,281
Well,

5047
02:15:30,281 --> 02:15:31,120
I mean what I'm saying,

5048
02:15:31,121 --> 02:15:33,910
it's the same set up of the
exact same ending with that.

5049
02:15:33,911 --> 02:15:35,050
That was the punchline.

5050
02:15:35,110 --> 02:15:36,190
I totally say.

5051
02:15:36,191 --> 02:15:37,024
I totally said,

5052
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:38,073
okay,

5053
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:39,550
well you know I moved here.

5054
02:15:39,551 --> 02:15:40,450
Frank and Nicole tear on.

5055
02:15:40,451 --> 02:15:42,400
You're the only one you've
seen doing this for 13 years.

5056
02:15:42,890 --> 02:15:43,840
Fifth 15 I'm so,

5057
02:15:43,850 --> 02:15:44,683
yeah,

5058
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:48,580
I caught the man short is is dead
actually Greg stopped doing it I guess,

5059
02:15:48,581 --> 02:15:49,500
but like it's,

5060
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:50,410
it must be tough to be like,

5061
02:15:50,411 --> 02:15:51,040
what the fuck?

5062
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,371
That's the all,

5063
02:15:51,371 --> 02:15:53,050
I'm the only one who's ever done that.

5064
02:15:53,051 --> 02:15:55,510
But it's like maybe
not maybe other people,

5065
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:59,620
but if you find out about it and he was
doing at first you kind of have to drop

5066
02:15:59,621 --> 02:16:00,454
it.

5067
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:01,510
You kind of have to drop it.

5068
02:16:01,511 --> 02:16:01,901
It's too,

5069
02:16:01,901 --> 02:16:02,681
it's too close off.

5070
02:16:02,681 --> 02:16:04,180
Freddy to this once about about,

5071
02:16:04,181 --> 02:16:04,451
uh,

5072
02:16:04,451 --> 02:16:07,360
about something he had and
some young black comics.

5073
02:16:07,361 --> 02:16:08,500
I do what I do that same joke.

5074
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:08,741
He goes,

5075
02:16:08,741 --> 02:16:09,574
okay.

5076
02:16:09,610 --> 02:16:09,850
He goes,

5077
02:16:09,850 --> 02:16:11,500
I'm saying I do that
same exact joke in front.

5078
02:16:11,501 --> 02:16:11,920
He was like,

5079
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:12,110
well,

5080
02:16:12,110 --> 02:16:12,910
enjoy it.

5081
02:16:12,910 --> 02:16:13,743
Yeah,

5082
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:14,881
I'm doing it too,

5083
02:16:14,881 --> 02:16:15,130
I hope.

5084
02:16:15,130 --> 02:16:15,970
How does it work for you?

5085
02:16:16,030 --> 02:16:18,580
Well Brendan Walsh and I had
that situation where Brandon was,

5086
02:16:18,581 --> 02:16:20,440
she worried that I stopped
that he was steelo right?

5087
02:16:20,610 --> 02:16:21,091
And I said,

5088
02:16:21,091 --> 02:16:21,421
no,

5089
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:21,591
it's,

5090
02:16:21,591 --> 02:16:23,300
it's a fucking joke about a fleshlight.

5091
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:27,510
Like there's a lot of like obvious
connections to like joking around license.

5092
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:28,201
And I told them,

5093
02:16:28,201 --> 02:16:28,591
by the way,

5094
02:16:28,591 --> 02:16:28,860
I'm,

5095
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,640
I'm done with it.

5096
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:31,540
That was on like my last special.

5097
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:31,780
Yeah.

5098
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:32,471
So it's like,

5099
02:16:32,471 --> 02:16:33,400
it's over already.

5100
02:16:33,401 --> 02:16:34,570
I already stopped doing it.

5101
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:35,030
Yeah.

5102
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:36,540
Whatever she told me once,

5103
02:16:36,541 --> 02:16:36,931
he was like,

5104
02:16:36,931 --> 02:16:39,780
I have something that's real similar
to what you're doing and I put it on,

5105
02:16:39,810 --> 02:16:40,051
I was like,

5106
02:16:40,051 --> 02:16:40,201
oh,

5107
02:16:40,201 --> 02:16:41,034
let's stop.

5108
02:16:41,190 --> 02:16:41,340
[inaudible]

5109
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:41,760
yeah.

5110
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:42,593
If,

5111
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:44,280
if you doing it now,

5112
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:46,260
and a guy had been doing it before,

5113
02:16:46,261 --> 02:16:48,360
like I didn't want
Brendan to stop doing it,

5114
02:16:48,390 --> 02:16:48,900
but,

5115
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:49,170
uh,

5116
02:16:49,170 --> 02:16:50,160
I wasn't going to get it done.

5117
02:16:50,161 --> 02:16:50,510
It.

5118
02:16:50,510 --> 02:16:50,930
Yeah.

5119
02:16:50,930 --> 02:16:51,240
I would,

5120
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:51,640
I mean,

5121
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:51,861
I,

5122
02:16:51,861 --> 02:16:52,180
I mean,

5123
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:53,490
I already read it rather,

5124
02:16:53,491 --> 02:16:54,324
um,

5125
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:55,380
wasn't doing any more,

5126
02:16:55,381 --> 02:16:56,460
not that it was going to stop doing it.

5127
02:16:56,490 --> 02:16:57,240
I wasn't doing anymore,

5128
02:16:57,240 --> 02:16:58,440
so it didn't matter to me,

5129
02:16:58,610 --> 02:16:59,170
but I mean,

5130
02:16:59,170 --> 02:17:00,300
it's on a special,

5131
02:17:00,570 --> 02:17:00,991
you know,

5132
02:17:00,991 --> 02:17:04,320
and I think honestly that he absolutely
came up with it on his own because it's,

5133
02:17:04,321 --> 02:17:04,660
it's,

5134
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:06,180
it's unnatural premise.

5135
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:07,750
The best is working the booth.

5136
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:10,270
One night after that Chinese spy plane,

5137
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:11,980
the American spy plane went down,

5138
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:13,330
almost hit us Chinese spy plane.

5139
02:17:13,331 --> 02:17:14,560
And what did they took our spy plane.

5140
02:17:14,590 --> 02:17:15,190
Yeah.

5141
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:15,461
And,

5142
02:17:15,461 --> 02:17:16,150
uh,

5143
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:21,150
I watched six comics that night make
a joke about his name being long way.

5144
02:17:21,550 --> 02:17:22,150
Yeah.

5145
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:22,941
Six comments.

5146
02:17:22,941 --> 02:17:24,220
It's to the point where the
audience is turning around.

5147
02:17:24,221 --> 02:17:24,401
It's like,

5148
02:17:24,401 --> 02:17:25,360
what's going on here?

5149
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:26,650
What is this a prank on us?

5150
02:17:26,651 --> 02:17:26,771
Like,

5151
02:17:26,771 --> 02:17:27,604
what's happening?

5152
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:28,720
But everyone is like,

5153
02:17:28,721 --> 02:17:30,820
I saw the story and yeah.

5154
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:34,250
Well that was so obvious
and then you realize,

5155
02:17:34,710 --> 02:17:35,543
yeah,

5156
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:36,090
yeah.

5157
02:17:36,090 --> 02:17:37,710
Well I had that Obama joke like,

5158
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:38,280
uh,

5159
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:39,510
about change and I was like,

5160
02:17:39,511 --> 02:17:42,420
oh brother always trying to get money
out of my pocket or something like that.

5161
02:17:42,421 --> 02:17:42,780
And yeah,

5162
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:43,261
I saw that.

5163
02:17:43,261 --> 02:17:43,560
Like,

5164
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:44,880
I think he saw Joey Diaz do it.

5165
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:45,000
Yeah.

5166
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:45,081
Yeah.

5167
02:17:45,081 --> 02:17:48,100
That's why I think you lose touch if
you don't hang out at clubs at all.

5168
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:50,240
Cause you lose touch with
what everybody's doing.

5169
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,410
Especially when it
comes to current events.

5170
02:17:53,930 --> 02:17:54,800
If there's an issue,

5171
02:17:54,801 --> 02:17:56,960
a big thing that happens automatically,

5172
02:17:57,500 --> 02:17:58,251
people are going to try to,

5173
02:17:58,251 --> 02:17:58,390
right.

5174
02:17:58,390 --> 02:18:01,090
Jeff Warren had a crocodile hunter joke
about let's put them in a different

5175
02:18:01,091 --> 02:18:03,610
situation with real
people that are dangerous.

5176
02:18:04,210 --> 02:18:04,630
You know,

5177
02:18:04,630 --> 02:18:05,650
everyone had that.

5178
02:18:06,550 --> 02:18:06,791
Well,

5179
02:18:06,791 --> 02:18:10,000
I mean even dom Irrera had it
fucking crocodile hunter job.

5180
02:18:10,060 --> 02:18:10,830
Everybody did.

5181
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:13,990
I love with ains squeezed the
testicles of this coca dial.

5182
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:16,570
Like everybody just
accepts it to the Russian.

5183
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:17,130
Yeah.

5184
02:18:17,130 --> 02:18:22,130
Do you think that there's also clubs in
Los Angeles that are on like the comics

5185
02:18:22,171 --> 02:18:26,730
that hang out there plus they don't
police each other as much as like say like

5186
02:18:26,731 --> 02:18:27,840
the comedy store.

5187
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:29,440
Cause I know,

5188
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:30,181
I'll tell you what,

5189
02:18:30,181 --> 02:18:32,830
there was a situation at the
laugh factory for a while.

5190
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:33,723
Yeah.

5191
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:35,110
Where it was like a den of thieves.

5192
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:37,680
Well I heard that also
about the Haha yeah,

5193
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:38,180
I've heard of

5194
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:39,980
honestly I think that
video you made Brian.

5195
02:18:40,490 --> 02:18:40,760
Yeah.

5196
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:45,760
I think that video made comics that
hadn't started yet who are now anywhere

5197
02:18:45,831 --> 02:18:49,740
between seven years in and one year in
which would likely the ones who start

5198
02:18:49,741 --> 02:18:50,120
stealing.

5199
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:50,301
Yeah.

5200
02:18:50,301 --> 02:18:51,830
And the ones that are
around clubs all the time,

5201
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:54,560
those people are more
likely to look out for it.

5202
02:18:54,561 --> 02:18:55,370
Now.

5203
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:56,480
Those people are all the ones like,

5204
02:18:56,481 --> 02:18:56,631
hey,

5205
02:18:56,631 --> 02:18:57,740
I can't wait to catch somebody.

5206
02:18:57,741 --> 02:19:01,010
So I think it's like it has put
a serious dent in the problem.

5207
02:19:01,011 --> 02:19:01,110
Things

5208
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:02,040
that have happened since then.

5209
02:19:02,041 --> 02:19:05,550
Like the patent Oswald one they've got
out and you know there's been a few that

5210
02:19:05,551 --> 02:19:08,880
have gotten out where people got and
then just be those people are done man,

5211
02:19:08,881 --> 02:19:09,780
they got tortured.

5212
02:19:10,290 --> 02:19:13,740
It's over when you steal
a joke today and this day,

5213
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,260
like there's a difference between um,

5214
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:21,980
similar premises and and parallel
thinking and then someone who makes it.

5215
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:24,090
It's like obvious man.

5216
02:19:24,091 --> 02:19:28,100
When a guy makes a career out of
doing other people's shit every now

5217
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:29,960
and then they try to do
one of their own bits.

5218
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:32,030
When they tried to do
one of their own bits,

5219
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:35,480
well fucking brutally obvious that they,

5220
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:35,950
the,

5221
02:19:35,950 --> 02:19:40,460
the humor in these bits is impossible
for them to have also come up with that

5222
02:19:40,461 --> 02:19:40,911
other stuff.

5223
02:19:40,911 --> 02:19:41,744
It's not,

5224
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,920
it's not the same mind.

5225
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:45,230
I saw a guy in San Diego do it once.

5226
02:19:45,231 --> 02:19:47,120
One of the new guys there
was like 10 years ago.

5227
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:48,141
Struggle,

5228
02:19:48,141 --> 02:19:48,651
struggle,

5229
02:19:48,651 --> 02:19:49,131
struggle,

5230
02:19:49,131 --> 02:19:53,720
each promotion then crush on a bit about
taking off a girl's Bra that I saw on

5231
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:55,640
the tonight show like like three,

5232
02:19:55,641 --> 02:19:57,290
six months early or whatever it was.

5233
02:19:57,291 --> 02:19:57,561
And I was,

5234
02:19:57,561 --> 02:19:58,940
and then bomb bomb,

5235
02:19:58,941 --> 02:19:59,774
bomb done.

5236
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:00,733
I was like,

5237
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:01,980
yeah man.

5238
02:20:01,980 --> 02:20:02,280
Steely.

5239
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:04,070
I used to do this one bit about,

5240
02:20:04,130 --> 02:20:04,490
uh,

5241
02:20:04,490 --> 02:20:07,580
having an argument with an Arab guy about,

5242
02:20:07,610 --> 02:20:07,970
uh,

5243
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:10,250
w whose country is more bad ass.

5244
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,020
That someone came up to him and said,

5245
02:20:12,021 --> 02:20:13,310
you should be very careful.

5246
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:13,911
You know,

5247
02:20:13,911 --> 02:20:18,911
like it was so obvious that he wrote that
bit cause it was so dumb and retarded

5248
02:20:18,981 --> 02:20:23,090
and clunky and it was like so obvious
that a person who had been stealing for so

5249
02:20:23,091 --> 02:20:25,090
long like these I'll get hears.

5250
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:26,660
These are the ones you
came up with on your own.

5251
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:27,261
It's amazing.

5252
02:20:27,261 --> 02:20:29,000
You would think though he
would have the format down.

5253
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:30,400
No.

5254
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:32,770
Would at least know the form of no,

5255
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:33,171
this is not,

5256
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:35,120
they're not studying it like a scholar.

5257
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:37,940
They just a burning shit repeating things.

5258
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:38,720
It's like,

5259
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:40,430
it's like watching directions on your gps.

5260
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:41,720
You don't have no idea how to get there.

5261
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:42,471
What's also,

5262
02:20:42,471 --> 02:20:44,600
what happens is you
don't learn the language.

5263
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:47,090
There's like a real
subtle language of comedy.

5264
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:48,111
Like you know,

5265
02:20:48,111 --> 02:20:49,010
language of music.

5266
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:49,660
Yeah.

5267
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:54,260
Well very similar because
like comedy or like music,

5268
02:20:54,261 --> 02:20:57,170
it has a rhythm to it and
there's tension and release.

5269
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:57,831
Yes.

5270
02:20:57,831 --> 02:20:59,540
You can get away with the worst
joke if you've made it like,

5271
02:20:59,570 --> 02:20:59,871
oh,

5272
02:20:59,871 --> 02:21:00,680
what's this going to go?

5273
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:01,610
Oh it's the pledge joke.

5274
02:21:01,611 --> 02:21:04,280
Everyone laughs hard and you would think
that someone who knows how to repeat

5275
02:21:04,281 --> 02:21:06,080
that shit would also
know how to create it,

5276
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:06,980
but it's not,

5277
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:09,590
it's not how it works because you also,

5278
02:21:09,591 --> 02:21:14,540
the mentality that it takes to steel
is the exact opposite mentality that it

5279
02:21:14,541 --> 02:21:18,710
takes to sort of open up your mind and
be creative to like to be like empty and

5280
02:21:18,711 --> 02:21:19,071
creative.

5281
02:21:19,071 --> 02:21:21,980
Like the mentality of a person
who steals is very selfish.

5282
02:21:22,190 --> 02:21:23,001
It's very me,

5283
02:21:23,001 --> 02:21:23,181
me,

5284
02:21:23,181 --> 02:21:23,481
me.

5285
02:21:23,481 --> 02:21:25,970
It's very all about getting
it done and you know,

5286
02:21:25,971 --> 02:21:29,690
and getting successful and it has nothing
to do with the art of it is you're not

5287
02:21:29,691 --> 02:21:30,890
trying to be an artist at all.

5288
02:21:31,130 --> 02:21:35,210
Whereas like to be creative you
have to have an artist mentality.

5289
02:21:35,210 --> 02:21:36,320
You have to relax,

5290
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:38,440
you have to like let the ideas come to,

5291
02:21:38,441 --> 02:21:42,230
you have to respect the ideas
like the Steven Pressfield's book,

5292
02:21:42,231 --> 02:21:44,180
the war of art is all about the muse.

5293
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:46,280
Like whether or not the
muse is a real thing.

5294
02:21:46,310 --> 02:21:48,020
It's like the concept of like,

5295
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:52,220
like abandoning yourself to the
whim of imbues and working hard.

5296
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:53,960
They don't work hard and working hard.

5297
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:55,080
Uh,

5298
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:58,610
er got off stage the
store and he was like,

5299
02:21:58,611 --> 02:21:59,780
saw some new bit and he was like,

5300
02:21:59,781 --> 02:22:00,291
Oh man,

5301
02:22:00,291 --> 02:22:01,760
you just keep come up with new stuff.

5302
02:22:01,990 --> 02:22:02,421
And he's like,

5303
02:22:02,421 --> 02:22:02,601
yeah,

5304
02:22:02,601 --> 02:22:03,021
I got stuck.

5305
02:22:03,021 --> 02:22:03,161
I said,

5306
02:22:03,161 --> 02:22:05,390
let's just come so easy for you.

5307
02:22:05,391 --> 02:22:05,690
And it goes,

5308
02:22:05,690 --> 02:22:06,350
oh no,

5309
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:07,460
make no mistake about it.

5310
02:22:07,461 --> 02:22:08,780
This does not come easy for me.

5311
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:09,973
It's not an easy,

5312
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:10,873
but it's,

5313
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:12,020
but it is easy,

5314
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:12,920
you know,

5315
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:15,200
it's not easy and it is easy
once you get a habit for him.

5316
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,150
I think humans are just
a form of force of habit.

5317
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:17,660
Yeah.

5318
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:21,720
I've been much more lately
over the last couple months.

5319
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:24,290
It's kind of weird because I have
actually have like last time,

5320
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:25,361
but been,

5321
02:22:25,361 --> 02:22:26,460
I mean last time I busy.

5322
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:26,790
Oh,

5323
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:27,710
less time to do right now.

5324
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:27,990
Yeah.

5325
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:29,040
But I'm forcing it in.

5326
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:30,060
I'm making myself do it.

5327
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:31,470
Because you've got that
problem on news radio,

5328
02:22:31,471 --> 02:22:31,980
right?

5329
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:32,790
Oh yeah.

5330
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:36,150
During news radio when I first got
on TV I fucking didn't do shit.

5331
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,080
And that was a big jump up.

5332
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:38,003
Listen owners.

5333
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:38,791
Yeah,

5334
02:22:38,791 --> 02:22:39,061
yeah,

5335
02:22:39,061 --> 02:22:39,241
yeah.

5336
02:22:39,241 --> 02:22:42,000
Well I was tired all the
time cause you were on a set,

5337
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:43,800
especially in the beginning it was radio.

5338
02:22:43,801 --> 02:22:46,680
Eventually we got it down to her was
where it was like we didn't even have to

5339
02:22:46,681 --> 02:22:47,670
show up four days a week.

5340
02:22:47,671 --> 02:22:49,260
Like sometimes we only
did three day weeks.

5341
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:49,800
Sure.

5342
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:50,041
Yeah.

5343
02:22:50,041 --> 02:22:51,890
We would get the schedule this.

5344
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:52,081
Yeah,

5345
02:22:52,081 --> 02:22:55,350
we would get the script in that we block
it the next day and they would shoot it

5346
02:22:55,351 --> 02:22:55,831
the next day.

5347
02:22:55,831 --> 02:22:56,760
It was like three days.

5348
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:57,150
Yeah.

5349
02:22:57,150 --> 02:22:57,983
It was easy.

5350
02:22:58,170 --> 02:23:00,660
We knew and the writers
really good and it was,

5351
02:23:00,661 --> 02:23:01,260
you know,

5352
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:02,370
it got to a good point.

5353
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:03,680
But so what does it became?

5354
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:04,561
It was long,

5355
02:23:04,561 --> 02:23:05,430
long fucking hours.

5356
02:23:05,431 --> 02:23:05,971
I got lazy.

5357
02:23:05,971 --> 02:23:06,680
Yeah.

5358
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:07,130
I uh,

5359
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:10,020
I just stopped doing standup
and then I'm doing it.

5360
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:10,711
Well No,

5361
02:23:10,711 --> 02:23:11,191
I did it,

5362
02:23:11,191 --> 02:23:11,671
but I wasn't,

5363
02:23:11,671 --> 02:23:12,930
I wasn't writing anything new.

5364
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:17,130
I was like going up with the same old
shit over and over and over again for like

5365
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:17,970
two years.

5366
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:20,310
Like I didn't write anything
new for like two years.

5367
02:23:20,311 --> 02:23:21,100
It sounds,

5368
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:21,230
yeah,

5369
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:21,841
it was terrible.

5370
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:23,940
I mean I might have had
like a bit here or there,

5371
02:23:23,941 --> 02:23:24,840
but they were dog shit.

5372
02:23:25,170 --> 02:23:27,480
I just wasn't focusing on Connie at all.

5373
02:23:27,481 --> 02:23:29,970
I was working all day doing the
show and then after it was over,

5374
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:31,291
if I did a set,

5375
02:23:31,291 --> 02:23:32,370
it was like a maintenance set.

5376
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:37,700
I would just go up on the weekend and
just do like do bits that I had done.

5377
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:39,510
Just go through the motions.

5378
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:40,883
I wasn't good.

5379
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:42,000
I had lost my,

5380
02:23:42,001 --> 02:23:42,420
uh,

5381
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:45,690
my spark and I'd lost the thing that
actually got me to the dance and the first

5382
02:23:45,691 --> 02:23:45,951
book,

5383
02:23:45,951 --> 02:23:46,650
she got it back.

5384
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:48,090
I can see a lot of people
never gotten that back.

5385
02:23:48,390 --> 02:23:48,840
Yeah.

5386
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:50,400
Well that's what I told you.

5387
02:23:50,401 --> 02:23:53,590
I saw Tim Allen once and 10 hour and
hadn't done standup in a long time.

5388
02:23:53,591 --> 02:23:55,950
And then he went on stage and it was like,

5389
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:57,630
it was like a famous guy.

5390
02:23:57,631 --> 02:23:58,650
I've never done standup before.

5391
02:23:58,980 --> 02:24:03,000
You would never believe that he was like
this guy who like would dominate and

5392
02:24:03,010 --> 02:24:04,560
girl stand up with dominance.

5393
02:24:04,910 --> 02:24:05,580
Oh yeah.

5394
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:06,241
For the time.

5395
02:24:06,241 --> 02:24:07,074
He was great.

5396
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:11,190
He was moved and the alleys
punchlines and it was powerful stuff.

5397
02:24:11,191 --> 02:24:12,660
He was really good at the time,

5398
02:24:12,900 --> 02:24:13,111
you know,

5399
02:24:13,111 --> 02:24:13,531
like he,

5400
02:24:13,531 --> 02:24:15,150
like people wanted to go see that guy.

5401
02:24:15,150 --> 02:24:16,560
Like the reason why he got that show.

5402
02:24:16,610 --> 02:24:17,443
Cause Yeah.

5403
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:18,920
People loved them.

5404
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:19,430
I mean,

5405
02:24:19,430 --> 02:24:19,690
it was,

5406
02:24:19,690 --> 02:24:20,400
it was fucking,

5407
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:21,350
it was fucking good man.

5408
02:24:21,351 --> 02:24:22,620
I really remember him as a standup.

5409
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:23,633
It was good.

5410
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:24,451
It was good.

5411
02:24:24,451 --> 02:24:25,021
People liked it.

5412
02:24:25,021 --> 02:24:25,440
Cool.

5413
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:26,610
But he was not good.

5414
02:24:26,611 --> 02:24:27,151
When I saw him.

5415
02:24:27,151 --> 02:24:27,984
He was done.

5416
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:28,681
He was done.

5417
02:24:28,681 --> 02:24:29,221
It was over.

5418
02:24:29,221 --> 02:24:29,570
It was,

5419
02:24:29,570 --> 02:24:30,121
it was a mass.

5420
02:24:30,121 --> 02:24:30,811
He had done,

5421
02:24:30,811 --> 02:24:31,380
you know,

5422
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:35,970
seven years of home improvement had been
living this bel air mansion lifestyle

5423
02:24:35,971 --> 02:24:39,780
and completely out of the loop of comedy
and the grind and getting up there and

5424
02:24:40,220 --> 02:24:41,460
that you lose that field.

5425
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:42,330
Would that do to you?

5426
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:43,163
Well,

5427
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:44,250
my set,

5428
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:44,970
um,

5429
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:49,560
I had one set that I fucking eight deck
in front of the writers of Newsradio.

5430
02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:51,330
Oh yeah.

5431
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:52,830
I had one of my friends,

5432
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:53,100
uh,

5433
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:53,580
my friend,

5434
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:54,413
uh,

5435
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:55,140
Josh Lieb,

5436
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:59,220
who was a writer and I'm a couple of
other people that were there who I really

5437
02:24:59,240 --> 02:24:59,761
respected.

5438
02:24:59,761 --> 02:25:01,350
I liked them and they,

5439
02:25:01,410 --> 02:25:02,243
they went up.

5440
02:25:02,990 --> 02:25:04,720
So you know,

5441
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:06,660
it was really late to,

5442
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:07,620
there was no,

5443
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:09,060
there was no energy in the room,

5444
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,050
there was no energy.

5445
02:25:10,290 --> 02:25:10,970
It was like,

5446
02:25:10,970 --> 02:25:11,280
you know,

5447
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:15,120
I was getting on in the main
room at like 1:00 AM ish and um,

5448
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:17,580
it was like at after
don't ever invite people.

5449
02:25:17,581 --> 02:25:18,414
We'll see.

5450
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:19,520
I didn't know.

5451
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:20,341
Oh I didn't know.

5452
02:25:20,341 --> 02:25:22,440
I didn't know they wanted to
come see me when you get to work.

5453
02:25:22,441 --> 02:25:23,820
I'm going to be the
comedy store when I am,

5454
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:28,570
but it wasn't just the 1:00 AM cause I
could do that same 1:00 AM set now and I

5455
02:25:28,571 --> 02:25:30,790
would kill for whoever's there.

5456
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,650
I'd be fine cause I prepare.

5457
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:34,420
But I didn't know,

5458
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:37,210
first of all I hadn't been doing that
much standup and I hadn't written anything

5459
02:25:37,211 --> 02:25:38,860
new and I just wasn't smooth.

5460
02:25:38,890 --> 02:25:39,790
I was just bad.

5461
02:25:39,791 --> 02:25:41,470
It was awkward and I felt like Shit.

5462
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,300
And I remember leaving going,

5463
02:25:43,330 --> 02:25:44,080
God damn it,

5464
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:44,650
I can't,

5465
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:48,490
I was really upset with myself
because I've had some bombs before.

5466
02:25:48,491 --> 02:25:51,400
But like I could sort of
rationalize them like,

5467
02:25:51,430 --> 02:25:53,350
oh I wasn't ready for that time.

5468
02:25:53,351 --> 02:25:54,010
I wasn't doing,

5469
02:25:54,010 --> 02:25:56,860
I was already a real legit
headliner at that point.

5470
02:25:57,010 --> 02:26:00,610
Like I could go on the
road and kill for an hour,

5471
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:01,121
you know,

5472
02:26:01,121 --> 02:26:04,270
it wasn't like as good as
the stuff I'm doing now,

5473
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:07,180
but like some of my sex
jokes and all that stuff,

5474
02:26:07,181 --> 02:26:10,210
like some of the really old
stuff like it would kill.

5475
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:10,960
It was good.

5476
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:11,793
It was good stuff,

5477
02:26:12,150 --> 02:26:12,640
you know?

5478
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,050
But I was just,

5479
02:26:14,380 --> 02:26:16,390
I was completely out of sorts.

5480
02:26:16,570 --> 02:26:19,000
I was saying the words
without thinking about them.

5481
02:26:19,001 --> 02:26:23,680
I realized that I had completely left
my focus away from stand up and that

5482
02:26:23,681 --> 02:26:25,930
embarrassment forced me to really gear up.

5483
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:28,690
So then I started like doubling
and tripling up on my sats.

5484
02:26:28,691 --> 02:26:30,730
I started writing again and then within,

5485
02:26:31,570 --> 02:26:31,871
yeah,

5486
02:26:31,871 --> 02:26:34,060
within two years I did my
first album and it was,

5487
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:34,870
wait.

5488
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:35,201
Yeah,

5489
02:26:35,201 --> 02:26:36,340
I was already way better.

5490
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:39,490
I had completely turned it
around within two years.

5491
02:26:39,491 --> 02:26:40,211
I totally,

5492
02:26:40,211 --> 02:26:41,350
completely turned it around,

5493
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:42,641
but it was,

5494
02:26:42,641 --> 02:26:43,060
um,

5495
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:44,440
one of those things where I realized like,

5496
02:26:44,470 --> 02:26:44,831
Oh,

5497
02:26:44,831 --> 02:26:45,910
I'm a lazy bitch.

5498
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,410
Like I lost my,

5499
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:50,380
the thing that got me to show
business in the first place.

5500
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:51,940
It's amazing how few then whatever,

5501
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:53,200
whatever it does it spark you.

5502
02:26:53,201 --> 02:26:56,170
If you then just push like I'm a
comic and I'm going to write this.

5503
02:26:56,220 --> 02:26:56,660
Yeah.

5504
02:26:56,660 --> 02:26:58,780
You're suddenly turn out this great stuff.

5505
02:26:58,840 --> 02:26:59,200
Oh yeah.

5506
02:26:59,200 --> 02:26:59,560
Yeah.

5507
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:00,330
I'm a professional.

5508
02:27:00,330 --> 02:27:00,490
Yeah.

5509
02:27:00,490 --> 02:27:01,690
That's part of war heart.

5510
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:03,610
You just hired a professional
to write your stuff for you.

5511
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:04,420
Yeah.

5512
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:07,630
This part of the war of art is
being a pro and this is new book.

5513
02:27:07,631 --> 02:27:08,620
It's called going pro.

5514
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:09,370
Going pro.

5515
02:27:09,370 --> 02:27:09,810
Yeah.

5516
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:10,511
It's fucking great.

5517
02:27:10,511 --> 02:27:11,620
It's really inspirational.

5518
02:27:11,621 --> 02:27:12,490
It's bad attitude.

5519
02:27:12,491 --> 02:27:13,630
Like I'm professional comic,

5520
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:14,943
like you know,

5521
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:15,783
uh,

5522
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:21,000
the other day before a show I did this
show at the state theater and when a new

5523
02:27:21,251 --> 02:27:24,610
Brunswick we'll probably the best
set I've ever had in my life,

5524
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:26,320
one of them top 10 ever.

5525
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:27,371
So,

5526
02:27:27,371 --> 02:27:27,910
um,

5527
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:28,121
um,

5528
02:27:28,121 --> 02:27:29,260
before my set,

5529
02:27:29,290 --> 02:27:31,600
I'm in my hotel room and
I like had this attitude.

5530
02:27:31,601 --> 02:27:31,841
I'm like,

5531
02:27:31,841 --> 02:27:33,970
the next three hours I'm
going to work on my shit.

5532
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:36,210
And I don't do that usually before I,

5533
02:27:36,690 --> 02:27:37,240
no,

5534
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:37,811
before I show,

5535
02:27:37,811 --> 02:27:39,070
it's like I did a show last night.

5536
02:27:39,070 --> 02:27:39,903
I don't know how to do it.

5537
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:42,790
I don't like sit down
and go over all my shit.

5538
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:44,420
But I went over all my shit.

5539
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,600
I wrote on my laptop,

5540
02:27:46,601 --> 02:27:47,840
I wrote on paper to,

5541
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:52,360
I wrote set lists out on paper and I
wrote bits out on a lot and I worked for

5542
02:27:52,361 --> 02:27:53,080
hours.

5543
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:56,620
I dropped Joey off at five o'clock we
had an eight o'clock show and for two and

5544
02:27:56,621 --> 02:27:56,891
a half,

5545
02:27:56,891 --> 02:27:57,724
three hours.

5546
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:58,810
All I did was right.

5547
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:00,040
Wow.

5548
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:00,760
Yeah,

5549
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,420
it's amazing.

5550
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:02,770
And it was one of the
best shows I've ever had.

5551
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:06,460
It was like my mind was like
sparked by the time I got on stage,

5552
02:28:06,461 --> 02:28:08,200
we were working it out
already because I'm working,

5553
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:08,861
you know,

5554
02:28:08,861 --> 02:28:09,690
you got to,

5555
02:28:09,690 --> 02:28:11,230
there's a certain amount you can pull off.

5556
02:28:11,231 --> 02:28:11,591
Just do it.

5557
02:28:11,591 --> 02:28:11,771
Look,

5558
02:28:11,771 --> 02:28:12,041
I come,

5559
02:28:12,041 --> 02:28:13,900
I might have a great set right now.

5560
02:28:13,901 --> 02:28:15,370
You could just give me
a microphone and it's,

5561
02:28:15,371 --> 02:28:15,870
if it's,

5562
02:28:15,870 --> 02:28:16,440
if it's a crowd,

5563
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:17,273
my crowd,

5564
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:19,660
I can kind of get into a groove right now,

5565
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:22,100
but to have the best chance of that,

5566
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:24,980
you should really sit down
and go over your shit.

5567
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:29,000
And there was a couple of things that I
said in the set that I had written down

5568
02:28:29,001 --> 02:28:30,020
for the first time.

5569
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:34,010
That day you're going over your story
and I turned to get a new angle and that

5570
02:28:34,011 --> 02:28:35,450
new angle killed.

5571
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:38,690
There was a couple of new bits
and I had new taglines or angles,

5572
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:40,730
not just fresh but insightful.

5573
02:28:40,731 --> 02:28:42,650
Like I had hit a nerve like,

5574
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:42,861
oh,

5575
02:28:42,861 --> 02:28:43,670
here's another,

5576
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:44,810
none of nerve a vein.

5577
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:46,820
When you're thinking on stage,

5578
02:28:46,821 --> 02:28:47,601
if you're doing it through a bit,

5579
02:28:47,601 --> 02:28:48,351
like here's point a,

5580
02:28:48,351 --> 02:28:48,711
point B,

5581
02:28:48,711 --> 02:28:49,160
point c,

5582
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:52,550
oh it's sparking something in my head
and let's a super quick yes to put it in

5583
02:28:52,551 --> 02:28:53,420
between C and D.

5584
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:54,141
I can get it.

5585
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:56,300
But when you're beforehand
and your hotel room,

5586
02:28:56,620 --> 02:28:57,650
we got some between c and d like,

5587
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:58,503
oh hold on.

5588
02:28:58,750 --> 02:29:00,590
And you could take 40 seconds,

5589
02:29:00,591 --> 02:29:01,760
two minutes to think it out.

5590
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:02,870
And now it's like,

5591
02:29:02,870 --> 02:29:03,021
oh,

5592
02:29:03,021 --> 02:29:03,291
okay.

5593
02:29:03,291 --> 02:29:05,360
That's the time I needed that
I wouldn't have had on stage.

5594
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:05,841
You know,

5595
02:29:05,841 --> 02:29:07,430
I like talking about bombing.

5596
02:29:07,650 --> 02:29:08,060
Um,

5597
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:08,893
and I think it's,

5598
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:09,410
it's,

5599
02:29:09,410 --> 02:29:11,270
I like talking about when I was a loser,

5600
02:29:11,271 --> 02:29:13,610
I like talking about my failures in life.

5601
02:29:13,790 --> 02:29:18,050
I like talking about being
insecure because I've met
so many fucking people that

5602
02:29:18,051 --> 02:29:19,070
thank me for that,

5603
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:20,570
that thought that like,

5604
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:25,210
oh here's this guy's been on TV
and he's a host for the UFC calm.

5605
02:29:25,230 --> 02:29:26,063
Everything's groovy.

5606
02:29:26,330 --> 02:29:27,320
But there's no,

5607
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,190
there's no groovy man.

5608
02:29:28,191 --> 02:29:31,130
We're just people and it's
a weird ride for everyone.

5609
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:35,210
Maybe blowjob joke used to
suck a dick and I always,

5610
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:38,150
but sometimes it would alienate crowd.

5611
02:29:38,151 --> 02:29:38,451
Yeah.

5612
02:29:38,451 --> 02:29:39,290
They will get upset.

5613
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:40,700
Like what are you doing?

5614
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:42,380
Yeah.

5615
02:29:42,381 --> 02:29:43,131
And then it worked.

5616
02:29:43,131 --> 02:29:47,480
It worked it and worked it and it got to
where it's just every time I needed to

5617
02:29:47,481 --> 02:29:52,481
figure out a joke to make the biggest
taboo ever funny child molestation,

5618
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:56,630
the most horrible non funny thing.

5619
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:57,140
Well it's,

5620
02:29:57,140 --> 02:29:57,681
and people would say,

5621
02:29:57,681 --> 02:29:58,150
listen,

5622
02:29:58,150 --> 02:29:59,540
trouble state is never funny.

5623
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:00,730
Actually.

5624
02:30:00,730 --> 02:30:04,670
Turns out it's okay if the
girl's hot and it's a boy.

5625
02:30:04,820 --> 02:30:05,653
That's what Patrice said.

5626
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:08,420
But in the interview where they're like,

5627
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:09,780
have you ever seen her
vape truck is funny?

5628
02:30:09,781 --> 02:30:11,360
He goes get my last special,

5629
02:30:11,870 --> 02:30:16,870
three of them is there's a way to work
almost everything to the point where it's

5630
02:30:18,441 --> 02:30:21,470
funny and sometimes it's an
exercise just to try to get there.

5631
02:30:21,510 --> 02:30:21,720
Yeah,

5632
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:22,910
just to see if you can do it.

5633
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:23,661
By the way,

5634
02:30:23,661 --> 02:30:25,040
my specialist available right now.

5635
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:26,150
Boom son.

5636
02:30:26,151 --> 02:30:27,560
That's how your market shit,

5637
02:30:27,590 --> 02:30:30,890
it's called passive aggressive and you
can get it@arishaffir.com right at the

5638
02:30:30,891 --> 02:30:31,670
top of the page.

5639
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:32,690
And by the way,

5640
02:30:32,691 --> 02:30:33,860
I have heard nothing.

5641
02:30:33,890 --> 02:30:35,870
I would not lie to you
and I would not bullshit,

5642
02:30:35,871 --> 02:30:37,580
but I've heard nothing but
compliments about that.

5643
02:30:37,730 --> 02:30:39,860
So many people told me
is your best shit ever.

5644
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:43,520
And so so many people told me that
they liked it even more than your last

5645
02:30:43,521 --> 02:30:43,881
special,

5646
02:30:43,881 --> 02:30:47,300
which they liked the album
which we have right here,

5647
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:49,580
which is also available on Itunes,

5648
02:30:49,581 --> 02:30:51,650
which is a revenge for the Holocaust.

5649
02:30:52,450 --> 02:30:55,240
It's the evil Ari spider
going to both have the same,

5650
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:57,470
actually it's going after a Hitler bug.

5651
02:30:57,590 --> 02:30:58,290
Hitler flatter,

5652
02:30:58,290 --> 02:30:59,123
leave him alone,

5653
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:01,850
leave him there alone.

5654
02:31:01,870 --> 02:31:02,870
Revenge for the Holocaust,

5655
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:03,800
which was by the way,

5656
02:31:03,980 --> 02:31:05,690
number one on iTunes bitches.

5657
02:31:05,970 --> 02:31:07,040
Everything changed.

5658
02:31:07,041 --> 02:31:07,874
Everything

5659
02:31:09,170 --> 02:31:10,100
that changed everything.

5660
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:12,410
That was when they all
woke up and they go,

5661
02:31:12,411 --> 02:31:12,561
oh,

5662
02:31:12,561 --> 02:31:13,580
this guy's for real.

5663
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:15,020
Like I started going to clubs more.

5664
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:16,700
I was like,

5665
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:17,690
I could just do this.

5666
02:31:17,930 --> 02:31:20,580
They all realize that have a following,

5667
02:31:20,970 --> 02:31:21,803
you know,

5668
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,920
one of the opening for you.

5669
02:31:23,921 --> 02:31:24,450
It always like,

5670
02:31:24,450 --> 02:31:24,930
Oh yeah,

5671
02:31:24,930 --> 02:31:25,381
you're funny,

5672
02:31:25,381 --> 02:31:27,930
but you know it's tough to Dow man.

5673
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:31,890
I told you like at one point
in time I told you we were,

5674
02:31:31,891 --> 02:31:32,701
we were talking about,

5675
02:31:32,701 --> 02:31:33,320
I'm like,

5676
02:31:33,320 --> 02:31:33,950
well you had,

5677
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:36,690
you were like trying to figure out whether
or not you wanted to do this gig or

5678
02:31:36,691 --> 02:31:37,440
you had something else come up.

5679
02:31:37,440 --> 02:31:37,621
I go,

5680
02:31:37,621 --> 02:31:37,891
dude,

5681
02:31:37,891 --> 02:31:39,330
people are coming to see you.

5682
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:41,790
Like you've got to realize
they're coming to see you too.

5683
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:42,361
They,

5684
02:31:42,361 --> 02:31:45,180
and they will eventually
follow you somewhere there.

5685
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:47,760
There's not a lot of opportunities
to get in front of a thousand people.

5686
02:31:48,150 --> 02:31:49,740
You can get in front of a
thousand feet especially,

5687
02:31:49,741 --> 02:31:50,660
but then we were doing clubs,

5688
02:31:50,661 --> 02:31:51,630
so it'd be over a weekend,

5689
02:31:51,631 --> 02:31:52,800
the thousand people over the weekend.

5690
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:54,780
If you can get in front
of a thousand people,

5691
02:31:54,781 --> 02:31:57,870
you can make a thousand fans
and then it thousand fans.

5692
02:31:57,871 --> 02:31:59,040
How many of them going
to remember your name?

5693
02:31:59,160 --> 02:31:59,371
Well,

5694
02:31:59,371 --> 02:32:01,290
if they're real fans of ours,

5695
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:03,460
they're going to be paying
attention to this whole loop.

5696
02:32:03,790 --> 02:32:04,623
So you enough.

5697
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:05,101
Don't remember.

5698
02:32:05,101 --> 02:32:06,210
You don't remember you,

5699
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:07,073
they saw you.

5700
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:11,880
We started doing shows and then the
real highlight of it wasn't Toronto,

5701
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:12,930
which uh,

5702
02:32:12,930 --> 02:32:15,000
I have on my fucking phone somewhere,

5703
02:32:15,001 --> 02:32:15,780
but I'm not going to find it.

5704
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:17,730
I tried to find it the other
day when you weren't here,

5705
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:20,080
when were talking about
it in Chicago coming up.

5706
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:22,120
You went on stage Tripoli,

5707
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:22,780
Bro.

5708
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:23,160
Yeah,

5709
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:27,510
you went on stage and the
fucking place went crazy.

5710
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:29,093
Toronto,

5711
02:32:29,490 --> 02:32:30,630
Toronto Massey Hall,

5712
02:32:30,690 --> 02:32:31,160
Dude,

5713
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:33,420
it's 3,400 people in there.

5714
02:32:33,421 --> 02:32:34,350
And when you went on stage,

5715
02:32:34,351 --> 02:32:36,920
they were cheering for
like 30 solid second.

5716
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:38,910
Holy Shit.

5717
02:32:39,090 --> 02:32:40,380
Well that was when you realize like,

5718
02:32:40,381 --> 02:32:40,831
oh my God,

5719
02:32:40,831 --> 02:32:42,090
they're my fans too.

5720
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:46,290
And then you were off to the races and
then from there it's like all of a sudden

5721
02:32:46,291 --> 02:32:48,480
your headline and all these
places and you're selling out.

5722
02:32:48,481 --> 02:32:52,890
And all these places and sometimes
all it takes is like one tweet,

5723
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:53,890
boom.

5724
02:32:53,890 --> 02:32:54,390
Let them know,

5725
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:55,290
let them know like that guy,

5726
02:32:55,291 --> 02:32:56,460
you know he's here.

5727
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:59,070
Well that's the beautiful
thing about my Twitter page.

5728
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:00,530
Yeah.

5729
02:33:00,530 --> 02:33:01,363
And it's like,

5730
02:33:01,490 --> 02:33:01,890
it's,

5731
02:33:01,890 --> 02:33:02,281
it's like,

5732
02:33:02,281 --> 02:33:02,730
uh,

5733
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:03,181
it's like,

5734
02:33:03,181 --> 02:33:03,530
uh,

5735
02:33:03,530 --> 02:33:05,160
a new distribution center.

5736
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:05,701
It's like,

5737
02:33:05,701 --> 02:33:05,911
Oh,

5738
02:33:05,911 --> 02:33:06,510
Ari Shapiro,

5739
02:33:06,510 --> 02:33:07,380
governor special out.

5740
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:07,800
You know,

5741
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,600
Joey Diaz is in Montclair,

5742
02:33:09,601 --> 02:33:10,200
you know,

5743
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:11,790
Brian red bands in Sacramento.

5744
02:33:11,910 --> 02:33:12,600
Like you can,

5745
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:15,210
you can use it and like you,

5746
02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:17,730
you can just bump everybody up.

5747
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:19,230
Everybody just pushes,

5748
02:33:19,231 --> 02:33:23,040
everybody gets pushed into mainstream
and then everyone's got a career.

5749
02:33:23,070 --> 02:33:24,390
Toronto's soak such a good mark.

5750
02:33:24,391 --> 02:33:25,740
I'm going there the beginning of June.

5751
02:33:25,770 --> 02:33:26,630
Toronto's amazing.

5752
02:33:26,631 --> 02:33:27,690
I'm going outside Ontario.

5753
02:33:27,691 --> 02:33:30,270
I'm going to Hamilton in London just
cause I'm like this places that are two

5754
02:33:30,271 --> 02:33:30,901
hours outside,

5755
02:33:30,901 --> 02:33:33,030
let's go there to Toronto is the shit.

5756
02:33:33,290 --> 02:33:34,950
That's one of my favorite cities ever.

5757
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:35,731
The people are,

5758
02:33:35,731 --> 02:33:37,920
it's like a city with nice people.

5759
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:38,970
It doesn't even make sense.

5760
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:41,270
And I know there's some
Douche bags in Toronto,

5761
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:43,050
New York with Nice people.

5762
02:33:43,051 --> 02:33:43,500
Yeah.

5763
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:44,333
Nobody's angry.

5764
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:44,551
Well,

5765
02:33:44,551 --> 02:33:46,020
I'm sure some people were looking to you,

5766
02:33:46,021 --> 02:33:46,800
but it's like,

5767
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:50,640
it's a notice will be different tone
than the average American gigantic city.

5768
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:51,690
Toronto is a cool city.

5769
02:33:51,820 --> 02:33:52,160
Yeah.

5770
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:53,430
As is Chicago.

5771
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:55,770
Chicago is very much like that in America.

5772
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:57,420
I know Chicago gets a lot of murders,

5773
02:33:57,570 --> 02:33:58,051
but I'll tell you,

5774
02:33:58,051 --> 02:33:58,770
man,

5775
02:33:58,770 --> 02:34:00,360
I fucking love Chicago people.

5776
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:00,660
Yeah.

5777
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:02,040
There's some fun people.

5778
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:07,020
They're like the nicest kind of people
that you find a new drink so hard and

5779
02:34:07,021 --> 02:34:07,854
they eat hard.

5780
02:34:08,010 --> 02:34:08,760
Oh yeah.

5781
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:09,481
That's salary.

5782
02:34:09,481 --> 02:34:09,970
Hat.

5783
02:34:09,970 --> 02:34:11,750
[inaudible] Salad,

5784
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:12,151
sugar.

5785
02:34:12,151 --> 02:34:15,540
It is sugar all over pizza for like,

5786
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:16,681
what does that,

5787
02:34:16,681 --> 02:34:17,341
what do you it up?

5788
02:34:17,341 --> 02:34:18,270
This is the best pizza

5789
02:34:18,270 --> 02:34:19,740
in Los Angeles isn't it's Chicago.

5790
02:34:20,490 --> 02:34:21,323
Where's that?

5791
02:34:22,050 --> 02:34:23,220
Montereau valley.

5792
02:34:23,221 --> 02:34:25,800
California malicious though.

5793
02:34:25,801 --> 02:34:26,670
The guys from Chicago,

5794
02:34:26,671 --> 02:34:29,760
he's the one that always brings me
to where to they ding Dong shows.

5795
02:34:29,761 --> 02:34:30,630
Remember that guy?

5796
02:34:30,631 --> 02:34:31,710
Have you ever ate that pizza?

5797
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:33,420
Where's the playground valid?

5798
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:37,260
I think it's like an hour
away from Los Angeles,

5799
02:34:37,261 --> 02:34:40,140
but just brings up pizzas
for us all the time.

5800
02:34:40,141 --> 02:34:41,280
But it's so good.

5801
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:45,040
Do me a favor and put my Boston
date on the Twitter page.

5802
02:34:46,330 --> 02:34:47,050
You're going to Boston.

5803
02:34:47,050 --> 02:34:47,521
Uh,

5804
02:34:47,521 --> 02:34:48,550
I'm going in July.

5805
02:34:48,551 --> 02:34:49,510
There's a UFC there.

5806
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:49,931
What are you doing?

5807
02:34:49,931 --> 02:34:50,101
The,

5808
02:34:50,101 --> 02:34:50,560
the um,

5809
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:51,130
Wilbur?

5810
02:34:51,130 --> 02:34:51,963
Yeah.

5811
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,410
Well where the first
show is already sold out.

5812
02:34:53,440 --> 02:34:54,130
That's your hometown.

5813
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:54,840
Yeah.

5814
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:55,930
First show sold out,

5815
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:57,370
but I'm doing another one.

5816
02:34:57,850 --> 02:34:58,510
Um,

5817
02:34:58,510 --> 02:34:59,210
it's a,

5818
02:34:59,210 --> 02:35:00,250
it's August 16th.

5819
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:00,461
Oh,

5820
02:35:00,461 --> 02:35:01,720
it's August to him.

5821
02:35:01,750 --> 02:35:02,583
They just added that.

5822
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:03,731
That's hilarious.

5823
02:35:03,731 --> 02:35:05,110
It's already sold out and it's an August.

5824
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:07,041
That's your hometown?

5825
02:35:07,041 --> 02:35:07,780
That's a homecoming.

5826
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:08,291
Yeah,

5827
02:35:08,291 --> 02:35:08,920
man.

5828
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:10,360
Almost sold out in the first day.

5829
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:12,790
It's just when the tickets just
went on sale the other day.

5830
02:35:12,791 --> 02:35:14,000
I don't get to Boston and not for,

5831
02:35:14,001 --> 02:35:15,580
it's one of the best places
they were to perform.

5832
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:16,480
And I'm,

5833
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:18,100
maybe I'll fucking record my new shit.

5834
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:19,990
They're just the perfect time.

5835
02:35:19,991 --> 02:35:21,190
Boston do it back home.

5836
02:35:21,230 --> 02:35:22,590
You have two shows at a theater,

5837
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:23,873
a fight

5838
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:26,290
stuff,

5839
02:35:26,290 --> 02:35:26,900
right?

5840
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:27,490
No,

5841
02:35:27,490 --> 02:35:28,270
it's all new.

5842
02:35:28,270 --> 02:35:29,103
It's all new.

5843
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:31,640
It's 100% knew from my last special.

5844
02:35:31,641 --> 02:35:33,850
It was not one to decide not
to do it at comedy works.

5845
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:34,960
That's not a bad second.

5846
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:35,561
Yeah.

5847
02:35:35,561 --> 02:35:37,030
It's not fun to come home situation.

5848
02:35:37,060 --> 02:35:37,211
Well,

5849
02:35:37,211 --> 02:35:40,600
it's also like the Wilbur's a weird
theater cause it's a thousand people,

5850
02:35:40,601 --> 02:35:42,130
but they're all like right in your face.

5851
02:35:42,370 --> 02:35:46,030
It's like there's the bottom
level of like a club chairs,

5852
02:35:46,090 --> 02:35:50,200
tables and then it goes cedar
and the balconies fairly low.

5853
02:35:50,470 --> 02:35:52,030
There's still like right in your face,

5854
02:35:52,070 --> 02:35:52,870
you know,

5855
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:53,261
so,

5856
02:35:53,261 --> 02:35:53,820
uh,

5857
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:54,070
uh,

5858
02:35:54,070 --> 02:35:55,000
if I decide to do it,

5859
02:35:55,001 --> 02:35:56,530
I'll let you guys know if
I decided to do it there.

5860
02:35:56,531 --> 02:35:57,370
But you know,

5861
02:35:57,490 --> 02:35:59,380
like for emotional reasons,

5862
02:35:59,590 --> 02:36:01,480
it's probably a good place
to do it because it's like,

5863
02:36:01,481 --> 02:36:02,140
that is my,

5864
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:03,400
that's where I started started.

5865
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:08,850
I will always have a devotion to Boston
comedy and the Boston comedy scene and

5866
02:36:09,551 --> 02:36:09,821
you know,

5867
02:36:09,821 --> 02:36:10,660
it's like that's,

5868
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:14,230
there was no place like that in the 80s
there was no place in the world like

5869
02:36:14,231 --> 02:36:15,040
that spot.

5870
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:15,731
And you know,

5871
02:36:15,731 --> 02:36:16,640
and so like that,

5872
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:17,890
it's not like that anymore.

5873
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:18,130
You know?

5874
02:36:18,130 --> 02:36:22,240
I Know Austin has a scene and I know that
San Francisco has a scene and there's

5875
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:23,320
scenes all over the country,

5876
02:36:23,321 --> 02:36:25,990
but Boston doesn't have the
same scene that he used to have.

5877
02:36:25,991 --> 02:36:27,310
It used to have the US scene.

5878
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,840
It was the place.

5879
02:36:29,020 --> 02:36:29,471
It was like,

5880
02:36:29,471 --> 02:36:32,710
there was these media centers like New
York and la where everybody aspired to go

5881
02:36:32,711 --> 02:36:32,921
to.

5882
02:36:32,921 --> 02:36:37,540
But then as far as like the place where
that was just pumping out savages,

5883
02:36:37,750 --> 02:36:38,530
you know,

5884
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:38,771
like,

5885
02:36:38,771 --> 02:36:40,540
look at all the guys
that came from that era.

5886
02:36:40,541 --> 02:36:41,300
Anthony Clark,

5887
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:42,400
a lot of people don't respect.

5888
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:45,880
Now we're watching on TV and
lucky he was fucking bad.

5889
02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:46,960
Actually in the 80s.

5890
02:36:46,961 --> 02:36:47,411
I'm telling you,

5891
02:36:47,411 --> 02:36:50,890
Anthony used to kill
Louis C K David Cross,

5892
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:53,980
Nick Depaulo teres put Teresa Neal,

5893
02:36:54,090 --> 02:36:55,630
Bill Burr Dude.

5894
02:36:55,631 --> 02:36:56,890
Stop and think about that.

5895
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:57,660
Um,

5896
02:36:57,660 --> 02:36:58,490
uh,

5897
02:36:58,490 --> 02:36:59,740
but mark Marin,

5898
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:00,893
um,

5899
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:01,810
yeah,

5900
02:37:01,810 --> 02:37:02,201
dude,

5901
02:37:02,201 --> 02:37:04,630
these are all Boston guys and Steven.

5902
02:37:04,630 --> 02:37:04,961
Right?

5903
02:37:04,961 --> 02:37:06,340
But that was before Lenny Clarke.

5904
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:06,601
I mean,

5905
02:37:06,601 --> 02:37:09,310
you can keep going on and
on and on that one spot.

5906
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:09,881
That little shit.

5907
02:37:09,881 --> 02:37:13,700
Shithole city pumped out
a fuck load of comics.

5908
02:37:14,190 --> 02:37:15,620
High level comics,

5909
02:37:15,621 --> 02:37:16,130
man.

5910
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:16,700
Yeah.

5911
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:17,660
Greg Fitzsimmons.

5912
02:37:17,870 --> 02:37:18,180
Oh yeah.

5913
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:19,013
Did I forget Greg?

5914
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:19,281
Dude,

5915
02:37:19,281 --> 02:37:21,200
I did his podcast at cap city.

5916
02:37:21,201 --> 02:37:22,034
They did a live one.

5917
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:22,760
Greg had one.

5918
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:23,270
Yeah.

5919
02:37:23,270 --> 02:37:23,550
Uh,

5920
02:37:23,550 --> 02:37:24,530
but I was there for Moontower.

5921
02:37:24,531 --> 02:37:25,364
Anyway,

5922
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:26,270
so this is the,

5923
02:37:26,270 --> 02:37:26,631
this is,

5924
02:37:26,631 --> 02:37:27,950
it's Fitzsimmons,

5925
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:29,660
Janine Garafalo and Andy Kindler.

5926
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:30,320
Ooh,

5927
02:37:30,320 --> 02:37:30,591
yeah.

5928
02:37:30,591 --> 02:37:31,424
And me in the middle.

5929
02:37:31,530 --> 02:37:33,200
I'm just looking at all of
them at some point I'm like,

5930
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:34,580
what am I doing here?

5931
02:37:34,730 --> 02:37:35,180
Yeah.

5932
02:37:35,180 --> 02:37:37,040
Well Fitzsimmons in you makes sense.

5933
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:39,110
But he tend to,

5934
02:37:39,111 --> 02:37:41,660
when I started Fitzsimmons
is already like a made guy.

5935
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:42,291
Oh,

5936
02:37:42,291 --> 02:37:44,290
you mean as far as like status wise.

5937
02:37:44,370 --> 02:37:44,730
Yeah.

5938
02:37:44,730 --> 02:37:47,660
So you're still trying to accept the
fact that your religion at comic?

5939
02:37:47,870 --> 02:37:47,991
Yeah,

5940
02:37:47,991 --> 02:37:48,824
I guess so.

5941
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:49,970
I guess that's what it this,

5942
02:37:50,830 --> 02:37:52,310
while you're more legit than kindler.

5943
02:37:52,311 --> 02:37:53,091
I love Kindler,

5944
02:37:53,091 --> 02:37:54,710
but you're much more
legit than kindler you.

5945
02:37:54,711 --> 02:37:56,160
He can't sell out of club for a weekend.

5946
02:37:56,190 --> 02:37:58,940
I guess it's just that when I
shouldn't be mean about that.

5947
02:37:58,941 --> 02:38:00,300
But you start and I say that.

5948
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:00,550
Yeah.

5949
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:02,900
But I say that because I don't think
kindler gets the respect that he deserves.

5950
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:06,410
And I think also because Keller is kind
of like the ultimate back of the room

5951
02:38:06,411 --> 02:38:06,950
crowds.

5952
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:08,390
It's hilarious.

5953
02:38:08,391 --> 02:38:08,721
It's very,

5954
02:38:08,721 --> 02:38:08,961
very,

5955
02:38:08,961 --> 02:38:11,180
very funny whisker off a low,

5956
02:38:11,181 --> 02:38:13,220
like a political as fuck,

5957
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:16,070
but also really nice political as fuck.

5958
02:38:16,130 --> 02:38:16,850
Yeah.

5959
02:38:16,850 --> 02:38:18,230
She saw into that stuff.

5960
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:18,650
Yeah.

5961
02:38:18,650 --> 02:38:19,550
It's kind of a silly game,

5962
02:38:19,551 --> 02:38:19,940
right?

5963
02:38:19,940 --> 02:38:21,080
It's fucking shows over folks.

5964
02:38:21,140 --> 02:38:21,890

Yup.

5968
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:28,700
All right.

5969
02:38:28,701 --> 02:38:29,360
You fucks.

5970
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:29,960

5974
02:38:34,130 --> 02:38:34,490
Um,

5975
02:38:34,490 --> 02:38:37,130
I can tell you about all
the podcast sponsors again,

5976
02:38:37,131 --> 02:38:38,990
but I think you probably
heard all this shit before.

5977
02:38:39,350 --> 02:38:40,430
I have a spot cast.

5978
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:41,061
Oh,

5979
02:38:41,061 --> 02:38:43,490
he has a podcast called
Ari Shaffir skeptic tank.

5980
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:44,150
Yeah.

5981
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:45,170
Tom Rhodes was on this week.

5982
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:47,070
He's not necessarily even
skeptical about everything.

5983
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:47,990
That's just a good name.

5984
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:48,770
Yeah.

5985
02:38:48,770 --> 02:38:49,550
Just me questioning.

5986
02:38:49,550 --> 02:38:52,550
Just it is what it
[inaudible] powerful road dog.

5987
02:38:52,670 --> 02:38:53,503
Tom Rose.

5988
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:54,811
Sharon asked him,

5989
02:38:54,811 --> 02:38:54,950
he said,

5990
02:38:54,950 --> 02:38:55,461
where are you living now?

5991
02:38:55,461 --> 02:38:55,920
He goes in there.

5992
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:56,551
Nice shoes,

5993
02:38:56,551 --> 02:38:57,240
man.

5994
02:38:57,240 --> 02:38:57,810
Wow.

5995
02:38:57,810 --> 02:38:58,700
That's that.

5996
02:38:58,880 --> 02:38:59,910
Go spot the spot.

5997
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:02,490
That's a legit fucking crazy person.

5998
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:03,150
Yeah.

5999
02:39:03,150 --> 02:39:03,983
I couldn't do that.

6000
02:39:04,450 --> 02:39:04,840
Yeah.

6001
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:05,190
Good.

6002
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:05,910
But I can't now.

6003
02:39:05,910 --> 02:39:06,870
He met a girl and got married.

6004
02:39:06,871 --> 02:39:07,201
He was like,

6005
02:39:07,201 --> 02:39:08,011
if you want to do this,

6006
02:39:08,011 --> 02:39:08,850
you've got to pair down.

6007
02:39:09,270 --> 02:39:09,900
Whoa.

6008
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:10,440
Yeah.

6009
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:11,221
And she's down.

6010
02:39:11,221 --> 02:39:11,761
She's with them.

6011
02:39:11,761 --> 02:39:13,530
She said she goes with him
everywhere on the road.

6012
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:13,990
Two,

6013
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:14,560
three.

6014
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:15,480
How's their whole life?

6015
02:39:15,570 --> 02:39:16,710
Oh my God.

6016
02:39:16,770 --> 02:39:19,350
And every weekend is a club or festival.

6017
02:39:19,740 --> 02:39:20,430
Wow.

6018
02:39:20,430 --> 02:39:21,450
That's a woman that's willing,

6019
02:39:21,451 --> 02:39:22,620
willing to live your life.

6020
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:22,860
Yeah.

6021
02:39:22,860 --> 02:39:23,820
About her own life.

6022
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,430
But if that life is cool to see the world,

6023
02:39:26,490 --> 02:39:26,641
hey,

6024
