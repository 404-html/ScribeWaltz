1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,460
Did Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com but if

2
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,840
you've heard the podcast before,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,890
you already know that.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,140
So I'll spare you most of the nonsense.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,760
If you use the code name Rogan,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,130
you get 10% off any and all supplements.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,670
The supplements are the
best shit available.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,140
The Best Shit we can find.

9
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,020
We sell you the stuff
that we actually use.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,180
I've been a fan of nootropics long before
I ever got involved in being a a pitch

11
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:30,900
man.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,410
But uh,

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,410
I am a firm believer in healthy diet and
nutrients for your body and I believe

14
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,080
that nootropics are beneficial
for cognitive function.

15
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,914
I take them,

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,490
um,

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,480
and that's why we sell them.

18
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,260
Alpha brain is the best
combination of nootropics.

19
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:51,030
We know how to put together if
there was a better combination,

20
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:52,050
if there's a better way to do it,

21
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,890
we would do that way.

22
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,000
That's just what we do.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,590
The,

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,440
the whole idea.

25
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,580
But that sounded so douchey.

26
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,720
That's just what we do.

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,450
I sound like a girl who's
like talking about her team.

28
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:01,200
We win.

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,460
That's just what we do.

30
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,020
I apologize for that.

31
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,231
Look,

32
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,480
I had loved these fucking things and
sometimes I don't even know what I'm

33
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,020
saying.

34
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,771
It comes out of my mouth.

35
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,041
I'm like,

36
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:08,874
really dude.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,450
Yeah,

38
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,283
really dude,

39
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,760
if I had a chance to edit this,

40
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,510
it'd be way better,

41
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,343
but I don't.

42
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,160
Uh,

43
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,330
all the other shit that we sell,

44
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,650
whether it's hemp force,

45
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,030
we were selling you the best quality
hemp protein that is available,

46
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,210
it is sweetened with natural
sweeteners is called Stevia.

47
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,870
There's like one gram
of sugar in a serving.

48
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,310
It's completely negligible.

49
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:29,971
And the,

50
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,271
the,

51
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,630
the beneficial nutrients that
you get from it are fantastic.

52
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,950
It's got raw cocoa in it,

53
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,880
which is a,

54
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,470
an excellent antioxidant.

55
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,850
It also has Maka in it,

56
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,950
which is a testosterone booster,

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,330
very healthy root.

58
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,111
So the,

59
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:43,501
the,

60
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:43,830
the,

61
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,081
the,

62
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:44,670
the,

63
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,930
the hemp protein powder that
we sell is the highest quality,

64
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,450
highest protein content available.

65
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,770
So it's all substantial nutrition
and it tastes fucking great.

66
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,700
And we got kettle bells and battle ropes
and go get yourself some grass fed beef

TV desk squad.

76
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,890
Dot TV is where the year.

77
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,180
So those shirts that everybody who,

78
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:16,680
where do you get these death squad
shirts people wear at our shows?

79
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,990
Those are all available at desk squad.

80
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:19,501
Dot TV.

81
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,600
And they are the creation
of Brian Red band.

82
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,570
They are 100% his.

83
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,310
He doesn't,

84
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,591
it's like,

85
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:25,891
isn't it?

86
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:29,520
You're not just buying a shirt from
a guy who like commissioned artists.

87
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,354
Like if you,

88
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,160
if you buy any of my
higher primates shirts,

89
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,750
I pay a dude to draw those things.

90
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,150
Like Brian actually makes these cats,

91
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:37,621
you know,

92
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:38,580
love him or hate him.

93
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,040
They're,

94
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,080
they're trippy as fuck.

95
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,790
And the new one,

96
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,131
uh,

97
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,260
that the new cat is my
favorite cat for sure.

98
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,610
We've got to do something with that dude.

99
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,231
Oh wait.

100
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:45,921
Do you see the newer,

101
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,480
newer one that I'm working on right now?

102
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,720
Um,

103
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,310
I'm nervous because this
was so fucking nervous.

104
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,470
Do you think I'm nervous?

105
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,940
It's hard to fucking do this now.

106
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:53,181
I'm like,

107
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,860
I got to make it better than the last one.

108
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,030
They're so weird.

109
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,751
You know the,

110
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:00,030
the strapped up with dynamite
and fuck crazy looks at it.

111
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:00,800
So it's like,

112
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,210
what is the message here?

113
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,970
Like what the fuck is the message here?

114
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,850
He has probably that we,

115
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,700
I have a great park,

116
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,000
has a Tom Green is Steevo
at death squad ITV TV.

117
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:11,640
Right now we just put
as Kat von D and dead.

118
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,311
Oh,

119
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,121
that's okay.

120
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,740
This is the ones that you've
been doing on Mondays.

121
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,430
Yeah.

122
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,850
Yeah.

123
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,190
Lots of great podcasts at a desk.

124
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,120
One on iTunes.

125
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,690
We got Kevin Pereira if you've
ever seen attack of the show.

126
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,860
Kevin prayer was a host for the longest
time and now he has one of the best

127
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:27,880
podcasts on the Internet.

128
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,510
Yeah,

129
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,291
it's fucking awesome.

130
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,250
The dude is just,

131
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,280
he's so smart and he's so cool and he's
just so in the right groove all the

132
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,660
time.

133
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,960
I love talking to that guy and I love
his podcast and it's called pointless and

134
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:44,170
you can catch that on
iTunes and it's all always,

135
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,220
all this shit is free.

136
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,413
Always free.

137
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,291
It will keep it free.

138
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,060
Except my comedy special bitch.

139
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,960
You got to pay for that.

140
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,340
It's only five bucks though,

141
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,060
you know,

142
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,680
when Louis C K set out to do it.

143
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,900
I think if you have to look at like,

144
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:56,230
uh,

145
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,630
the best comics in the country right now,

146
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,050
I'd say Louis C K is like right
at the very top of the heap.

147
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,750
So when Louis C K puts
a comedy special out,

148
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:05,584
it's five bucks.

149
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,120
You can't make your six,

150
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,661
you know,

151
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,520
you got to do five bucks too stupid,

152
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:09,971
you know,

153
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,960
or four.

154
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,141
Well,

155
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,310
how about you be a little humble.

156
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,110
You're shit's worth about three 50,

157
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,220
you know?

158
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,521
But,

159
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,030
um,

160
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,481
the,

161
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:16,631
uh,

162
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,830
the ability to do that,

163
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,310
uh,

164
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,830
that Louie exposed was a huge,

165
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,051
I mean,

166
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,020
it was just an amazing new thing.

167
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,760
Like a light went off in
my head when I saw it,

168
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,121
I was like,

169
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:25,571
oh my God,

170
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,950
that's how I'm doing
everything from now on.

171
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,780
It's just like,

172
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,260
I wish I'd thought of it myself,

173
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,490
but I'm so glad he did.

174
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,863
And um,

175
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,870
it's available DRM free on Joe rogan.net.

176
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,621
It's only five bucks.

177
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:35,951
You can get it,

178
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:36,910
you can use paypal.

179
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,530
And Amazon and uh,

180
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,910
I paid for the whole thing.

181
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:42,810
I paid to get it produced
and filmed and edited.

182
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Any costs of gifted.

183
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,420
Like I sent one to my dad.

184
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,830
He just guided,

185
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,990
I just got an IPAD and apple TV.

186
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,610
So now he's all appling it out.

187
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:51,540
So I send them a,

188
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,190
I said it goes to his email.

189
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,770
He just clicks on it and downloads
it and then he could just,

190
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:56,220
you know,

191
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,851
streaming right.

192
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:57,870
Two is a TV.

193
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,360
That's great.

194
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,510
I always had that uncomfortable moment
when I have to talk to dude after he seen

195
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:02,740
my act for the first time.

196
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,770
Especially

197
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,603
the older guy.

198
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,983
He's already seen you.

199
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,620
Oh really?

200
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,790
Maybe you saw you like seven years ago
when we were there for the men of men of

201
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,140
color.

202
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,381
Oh,

203
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:11,500
the,

204
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,921
yeah,

205
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,521
that's right.

206
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,061
That's right.

207
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:13,271
Yeah,

208
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:13,630
we did.

209
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,463
That's right.

210
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,001
Yeah.

211
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:16,420
All right.

212
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,650
We'll start this podcast ladies.

213
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,100
Gentlemen.

214
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,270
Andrew dice clay is here.

215
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:20,740
Bitches respect,

216
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,433
experience.

217
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,920
[inaudible]

218
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,221
New Year's Eve.

219
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,054
You dirty fucks.

220
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,710
It's going down and drew mother
fucking dice clay where it will be.

221
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,041
How the,

222
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,790
how can I say it?

223
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,630
Showtime.

224
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,650
Showtime,

225
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,940
10:00 PM on showtime.

226
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,833
On showtime.

227
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,950
Is this something you've worked,

228
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:43,631
you've already filmed,

229
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,270
it's not going to be,

230
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,450
no,

231
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,600
I've shown this already.

232
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,180
You said you were very happy with it,

233
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,380
really happy with it.

234
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,130
But you know,

235
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,910
I really stayed on it from beginning 10.

236
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,030
I had a concept,

237
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,930
you know,

238
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,520
that I wanted to do as far as I'm
concerned the most like an ultimate

239
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,550
rock and roll standup show
to really bring excitement,

240
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,341
you know,

241
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,001
because like,

242
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:05,191
you know,

243
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:05,500
you know,

244
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,370
you're very animated on stage,

245
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,091
you know,

246
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,230
you're all over the place,

247
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,070
you move,

248
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:10,761
you know,

249
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,410
you could see that life and you,

250
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,280
you know,

251
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,370
and that's like the one thing that
always bothered me about Comedians,

252
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,160
that they don't know too
much about performance art.

253
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,300
Especially,

254
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:20,960
you know,

255
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,190
when the cameras are rolling,

256
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,060
everybody thinks that great and then the
cameras turn on and they stand like a

257
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:26,900
fucking mummy,

258
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,621
you know?

259
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:32,621
So I really wanted to give a real
edgy rock and roll's special.

260
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,310
And you know,

261
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,570
as you've met before,

262
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,321
my son's,

263
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:36,771
you know,

264
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,900
La Rocs opens the show.

265
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,243
Um,

266
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Eleanor Kerrigan,

267
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,141
you know,

268
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:42,960
who opens my,

269
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,930
my shows is in the special,

270
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:48,890
which you never even see an
opening act in a one hour special.

271
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,450
And it's just from the second
it starts to the second it ends.

272
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,290
It's just exciting and it's fucking funny,

273
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,281
you know?

274
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:58,850
And that's,

275
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,260
that's what I wanted to deliver.

276
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,090
I wanted to give people something that,

277
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:02,990
you know,

278
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,711
especially,

279
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:03,951
you know,

280
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,030
the way the world is today,

281
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:07,310
the whole political
correctness fucking shit.

282
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,091
You know?

283
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,020
And I wanted,

284
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,320
I made sure there was nothing
politically correct about this factual,

285
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,711
you know,

286
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,460
because you know what comics are
being put on trial in telling,

287
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:19,851
you know,

288
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:23,150
a gay joke or a black joke and you know,

289
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:23,510
now,

290
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,560
now the whole world,

291
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,131
what do you think,

292
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:25,371
you know,

293
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:25,880
when,

294
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,630
when Tmz stop and you go,

295
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,030
what do you think of,

296
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,893
you know,

297
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,500
you know,

298
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,220
Tosh,

299
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,641
you know,

300
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,970
Daniel tosh saying this,

301
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,531
I go,

302
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,820
it's a fucking joke.

303
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,230
Isn't that the point?

304
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,130
Are we allowed to comment
on what goes on socially,

305
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:40,431
you know,

306
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,264
in the world.

307
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,830
And since when is someone joking and
being serious at the same time since when

308
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,030
is that a real statement?

309
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,180
When someone's saying something
that's obviously ridiculous,

310
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,530
they don't really mean that.

311
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,580
You're so stupid,

312
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:53,780
you can't interpret that.

313
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,291
You can't,

314
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:54,801
you know,

315
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,251
why are we,

316
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,110
why are we running for office medians?

317
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,660
And the idea is that when,

318
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,130
when someone says something offensive,

319
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:01,964
that's a joke.

320
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,090
The idea is that somehow it's the exact
same thing as saying something offensive

321
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:07,821
about a person,

322
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,290
whether it's a racist thing or
a gay thing for being crude,

323
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,430
having an argument and
calling somebody a name.

324
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:13,880
No,

325
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,320
we're not saying it for an effect.

326
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,950
That's right.

327
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,470
And it's an art form and people,

328
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:18,830
you know,

329
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,310
this is,

330
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,671
you know,

331
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,770
a time where people need to really laugh.

332
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,101
You know,

333
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:22,760
I,

334
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,593
I really want that,

335
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,070
the New Year's Eve spot
because you also know,

336
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,933
you know,

337
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,040
especially cause that hurricane
happened on these coasts.

338
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,260
And I know a lot of people don't go out,

339
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:38,261
it's house parties and I just want this
stomachs to fucking hurt from the things

340
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:41,150
I'm saying on that stage.

341
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,541
Well listen,

342
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,620
I saw you in Vegas,

343
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,190
me and Norton and funny and Oh yeah,

344
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,440
yeah.

345
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,200
Red Band came Sam,

346
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,531
uh,

347
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:53,531
from a opiate Anthony show and we had
the fucking best time cause that's like,

348
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,040
it's a rare treat for me to be able to

349
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,290
go and just sit down and be
an audience member and enjoy.

350
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,193
Yes.

351
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,930
At a great show and seeing
somebody that won't aw,

352
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,950
no matter where.

353
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,401
You know,

354
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,510
the first time I even did Vegas years ago,

355
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,363
uh,

356
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,910
for,

357
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,450
you know,

358
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,300
for the comedy store when the
comedy store was at the dunes,

359
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,430
I got fired the second night,

360
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,361
you know,

361
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,290
full language,

362
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,573
you know,

363
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,570
and you know,

364
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,591
is this you?

365
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,000
Is this the new special yeah.

366
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,293
It,

367
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,191
yeah.

368
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:23,730
I want,

369
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:23,971
you know,

370
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:24,301
I didn't,

371
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,110
I didn't wear anything too
intense as far as an outfit.

372
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,330
I didn't want to go with the LVC jackets.

373
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,010
You know,

374
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,610
I went through it very street.

375
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,070
I want to stage to look street,

376
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,343
you know,

377
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,180
is show you put on in
Vegas was fucking awesome.

378
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,790
I really enjoyed it for this,

379
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,600
you know,

380
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,820
prepared for it in Vegas
and around the country.

381
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:45,654
But I did,

382
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,171
you know,

383
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,480
just pissed you had 28 weeks in Vegas.

384
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,051
You know,

385
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:50,310
I just wanted a tight,

386
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,510
because as good as you think it might
be when the cameras are rolling,

387
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,344
like I said,

388
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,120
you all going to fuck up a little,

389
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,770
you know,

390
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,140
you know,

391
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,140
like I was doing this one bit where I
left out a whole chunk of the bit because

392
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:09,000
I was so into like performing for the
crowd that after the show was over,

393
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:09,691
you know,

394
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:10,800
the producers were like,

395
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,490
you know,

396
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,720
my wife funes she goes,

397
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,010
you left out this,

398
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,000
this and this.

399
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,640
You know.

400
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,690
But that was the warmup,

401
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,560
you know?

402
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,690
And then the second show I came out to
just annihilate the crowd and the crowd

403
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,920
was,

404
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,191
you know,

405
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,000
it was bedlam.

406
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,400
It was as insane as I was,

407
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,810
you know,

408
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,460
was,

409
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,740
you know,

410
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,510
it was very reminiscent of my first
special as far as the audience reaction.

411
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,140
The energy.

412
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,351
Yeah.

413
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,760
We did it in Chicago.

414
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,500
I mean the band kicked ass.

415
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,571
I mean,

416
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,530
do you feel like you're
having like a resurgence?

417
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,940
It's,

418
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,630
it's a complete resurgence,

419
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,140
you know?

420
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,591
I mean,

421
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,290
just by the response of the people,

422
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:46,921
you know,

423
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:47,521
years ago,

424
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:47,791
you know,

425
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,710
when I would say certain
things with women,

426
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,430
you know,

427
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,580
it was the Ah,

428
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,000
you know,

429
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,100
that she say,

430
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,353
you know,

431
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,520
and today when I,

432
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,383
when I,

433
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:57,991
you know,

434
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,760
when I tell them what piglets
they've become duty years now,

435
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,770
they got that fist pumping in the air.

436
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:05,700
Like yeah,

437
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,361
dice,

438
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,194
dice,

439
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,820
you know,

440
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,401
for an error.

441
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,234
Right.

442
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,900
People are more accepting
of fucked up shit now.

443
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,920
But also people have changed because
a lot of what I talk about his sexual,

444
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,671
you know,

445
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:18,870
and women have changed.

446
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,700
They're the ones that wrote the material,

447
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,451
you know,

448
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:21,960
that,

449
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,793
you know,

450
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,101
you know,

451
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:24,060
in this day and age,

452
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:24,450
you know,

453
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,030
I had a call from a friend
of mine that was with a girl,

454
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,470
went out with a thought,

455
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,850
she was a sweet girl and you know,

456
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,360
they wound up just doing everything
imaginable to each other.

457
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,561
And he tells me,

458
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,240
so I call it the next day,

459
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,141
you know,

460
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:37,411
you know,

461
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:38,580
to see how she's doing,

462
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:38,911
you know,

463
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:39,691
letting her know,

464
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:41,130
like it's not forgotten.

465
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:42,120
Like I want to see you.

466
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,961
And she goes,

467
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:43,980
I'll call you right back.

468
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:45,330
And she never even called me again.

469
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:45,990
He said,

470
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,410
he goes,

471
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,180
I was the one night stand.

472
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,130
But that's how things have changed,

473
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,990
that they've become so aggressive.

474
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,200
You know,

475
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,760
you can't go by the face,

476
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,750
you can't go by.

477
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,231
Oh,

478
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,570
she's got that girl next door look,

479
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,261
you know,

480
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,370
and the next thing you know,

481
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,930
she's a contortionist view,

482
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,231
you know,

483
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:05,320
wrapping her feet around the back
of her neck while you're banger.

484
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,550
You know what I mean?

485
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,170
That's what it is today.

486
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,370
That didn't exist before.

487
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,581
Well,

488
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,100
you know why I didn't have one like that.

489
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,320
You know,

490
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,180
I haven't hit the contortionists thing,

491
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,350
but you know,

492
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,860
I always thought a woman
in the bedroom or you know,

493
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:21,551
in a subway,

494
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,620
wherever you might be
banging her at the time,

495
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,330
you know,

496
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,420
a dressing room,

497
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:27,280
whatever a but car,

498
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,114
whatever.

499
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,461
You know,

500
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,294
when Allie,

501
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,010
you know,

502
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,000
should be the kind of woman she wants
to be like that she doesn't have to hold

503
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:34,750
back.

504
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,060
Because I always felt like
a lot of relationships,

505
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,841
you know,

506
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:42,841
like I'm married now for the third time
and I feel a lot of relationships start,

507
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:43,690
you know,

508
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,490
splitting apart because people are an
honest at the beginning about what they

509
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:48,881
like,

510
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,170
how they like to be.

511
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:50,741
You know,

512
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:54,730
years ago a woman wouldn't let you know
all these little things that might,

513
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,270
you know,

514
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,560
push her buttons and sooner or later
she's doing it with some other guy because

515
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,900
she's now afraid to tell
you what she's about.

516
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,340
And you know,

517
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,690
I would always let a woman,

518
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:05,500
no,

519
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,620
just be the pig that you are.

520
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,780
If I had to say comedically,

521
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:11,441
you know what I mean?

522
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,640
Be what you want to be.

523
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:13,900
I don't judge that way.

524
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,651
Yeah.

525
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:19,090
I think slowly but surely everyone's
going to just be what they want to be

526
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:19,870
because of it.

527
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,051
Yeah.

528
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:20,290
But,

529
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,920
but when you,

530
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,400
when you were in a relationship
and you don't start out that way,

531
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,130
you know,

532
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,800
that's where the problems could,

533
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,720
could arise.

534
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,470
Awesome.

535
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,160
People grow in different directions,

536
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,431
you know,

537
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:33,520
that happens to one person would get
freaky or the other person wants to settle

538
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,354
down more.

539
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:34,870
Well,

540
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,620
you know what,

541
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,130
you know,

542
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,311
I,

543
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:36,671
you know,

544
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:37,241
I always said,

545
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,760
what guy that's with a woman for
a bunch of years in the audience?

546
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,031
I go,

547
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:40,930
what are you going to leave her?

548
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,360
Just the fallen hate all over again.

549
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,553
You know?

550
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,780
Cause it always starts out nice.

551
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,831
You know what I mean?

552
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:48,970
And then a couple of years later,

553
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:53,320
it's that fucking money grubbing
a hole all the way to plaintiff.

554
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,030
Yeah.

555
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,520
How was,

556
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,881
you know,

557
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,890
so is it possible to break that chain?

558
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,993
How do you break that chain?

559
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,331
You know,

560
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:59,164
we're doing good,

561
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,440
you know,

562
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,630
me and my wife doing good.

563
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,530
She seems happy.

564
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:03,460
She's always smiling.

565
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:04,710
You're always smiling when you weather.

566
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,201
Yeah.

567
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,250
She makes me happy.

568
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:07,300
We make each other happy.

569
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,430
Is it just a matter of
getting the right combination,

570
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,750
the right to humans?

571
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,560
You know what it is.

572
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,380
You really do have to search that out.

573
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,281
And you know,

574
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm not going to sit here and make like,

575
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,980
we'd never had an argument.

576
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:18,191
I mean,

577
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,024
she's Latin,

578
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,933
you know?

579
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:20,590
I mean,

580
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,000
it gets crazy sometimes,

581
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,970
but we always know that with tight,

582
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,010
that's what keeps you together.

583
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:27,251
I mean,

584
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,900
an argument happens with anybody,

585
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,240
but you got to know that,

586
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:31,481
you know,

587
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:35,170
you got all these other things in the
relationship that keep you together.

588
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,243
Right?

589
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,690
Yeah,

590
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:37,901
yeah.

591
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:38,650
If you'd just,

592
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,041
but that's,

593
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:39,311
you know,

594
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,210
but that's what I taught.

595
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,511
You know,

596
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:40,810
when I,

597
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,890
when I'm on stage,

598
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,180
it's a different side of me.

599
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:43,421
It's,

600
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,254
you know,

601
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,920
it's,

602
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,580
you know,

603
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,010
an animal unleashed that
when I'm on a stage,

604
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:53,011
I could just have the freedom to say
things the way I see it and paint these

605
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,711
crazy,

606
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:58,760
almost like pornographic
comedic cartoons for people.

607
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,940
And they laugh because
they know that doing it,

608
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,050
you know what I mean?

609
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,400
They know,

610
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:03,620
you know,

611
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,840
when you see a couple and you,

612
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:05,390
you do,

613
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,631
you know,

614
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:06,890
with similar in that thing,

615
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:11,780
you say what you feel onstage and whenever
you see those couples that look at

616
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:12,920
each other and laugh,

617
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,660
those are the couples that go,

618
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,010
how does he know?

619
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,830
How does he know what an animal I am?

620
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,091
You know what I mean?

621
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,350
How does he know this?

622
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,010
You know?

623
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,150
But that's research.

624
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,451
You know,

625
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,670
you go through life and
you learn different things.

626
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,533
Research.

627
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,051
Yeah.

628
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,290
It's gotta be research.

629
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,550
Yeah,

630
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,121
absolutely.

631
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,620
Everything is research really.

632
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,120
I was with a contortionist recently
and I thought it would be amazing.

633
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:34,421
I mean,

634
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,980
I always picture it would be amazing,

635
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:39,850
but she's always just really sore and
she always has a fucked up Chin because

636
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,500
there were Chin's always
on the floor and shit.

637
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:42,334
Like,

638
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,211
really?

639
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:43,600
Yeah.

640
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,470
And I'm a Chin Guy.

641
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,870
Like you have to have s I don't like
wait Chan's where it's just like,

642
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:47,131
Whoa,

643
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:47,430
whoa.

644
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,711
You know?

645
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,640
And then when it's,

646
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,720
when it's a nice Tampa,

647
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,770
it's all like scratched up and rashy
they use the bottom of the channel.

648
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,980
They're always on their chins.

649
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,051
Yeah.

650
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:57,160
That's interesting to me.

651
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:57,401
I,

652
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:57,671
you know,

653
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:58,780
I haven't hit that yet.

654
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,530
Wow.

655
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,790
We do any chin work.

656
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,150
There's no chin work and us.

657
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,770
What do you mean with the chin?

658
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,350
Because like when they do contortionist

659
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,233
don't lie to me,

660
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,510
our photo,

661
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,250
it's a good mobile
coming into the new year,

662
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,670
just fucking around with me.

663
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,770
I'm going to get 900% like a lot of times.

664
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,760
Well at Brown poodle photo for him.

665
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,530
Photo up at the Chins Chin.

666
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,420
Okay.

667
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,890
How would you even have that here?

668
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,770
She worked.

669
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,260
I have been,

670
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,093
and I say where she works,

671
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,730
but she,

672
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,563
she uh,

673
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:33,590
she would always be in a position where
her face is always on the ground in a

674
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:34,051
wet feet.

675
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:36,750
Go all the way over the
black brown hair like this,

676
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:36,961
you know,

677
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,090
so she's like sitting there like that.

678
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,610
Just her,

679
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,180
her,

680
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,470
whenever she's doing contortion is,

681
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:41,770
she's always on her chin here.

682
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:42,630
I started some photos.

683
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:44,280
If you look at a TV right there,

684
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:44,820
like,

685
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,653
uh,

686
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,190
absolutely the snow you don't see
like see like this right here,

687
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:52,980
like this kind of stuff where
she has her chin right here,

688
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,361
girl that,

689
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:54,910
you know,

690
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,460
this is not her to seven,

691
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:57,040
but

692
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,873
uh,

693
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,540
no,

694
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,700
he's just going seven year old woman.

695
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,543
This is a woman,

696
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,290
a woman.

697
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:06,831
See that,

698
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:07,710
that woman's legs,

699
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,863
she's doing

700
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,940
chins on the ground.

701
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,290
You'd never think about it.

702
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,430
Pick a torsion is always happy.

703
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,320
Patients are younger.

704
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,190
If you're stepping on a
head and you're in there,

705
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:15,851
you know what I mean?

706
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:16,630
That's no good.

707
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,700
So that just a weird
position to put your body.

708
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,563
Yeah,

709
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,520
that's not a position I could get
into one thing and then in sexy,

710
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,780
just don't think about it like,

711
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,121
yeah,

712
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:25,901
you look at their legs,

713
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,510
bend really far back when you were
putting them up above your legs,

714
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:29,344
but you're not going like,

715
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,771
all right now,

716
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:30,820
can you been in this backwards?

717
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:35,290
I just wouldn't make it a meatball or
to stretch what you check before you

718
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:35,800
begin.

719
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,131
No,

720
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:36,730
I don't.

721
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,563
It's easily,

722
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,020
it's probably better than a
chick with a hamstring pull up.

723
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,140
Yeah,

724
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,311
yeah,

725
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:41,451
yeah,

726
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:42,160
yeah,

727
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,540
yeah.

728
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,650
If it was the opposite,

729
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,551
like owl,

730
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:45,810
don't pull my leg out.

731
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,480
Be better off of the contortions.

732
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,853
That's funny to me.

733
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,770
Oh yeah.

734
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,190
Yeah.

735
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,610
See he looks like a nice guy,

736
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,444
right?

737
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,970
He looks like no,

738
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,470
but I'm saying it looks
like a regular nice guy,

739
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,840
but look what he's into.

740
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,950
Well,

741
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,130
you just gave it a shot.

742
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,690
In his defense,

743
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,250
he didn't necessarily say he was into it.

744
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,890
You've got a girlfriend right now.

745
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:08,980
Sure.

746
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,813
Yeah.

747
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,823
No,

748
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,910
nothing steady.

749
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,220
Yeah,

750
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,690
I have.

751
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:12,871
Yeah.

752
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:14,130
I have a steady in a,

753
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,370
yeah,

754
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,440
to what does that even mean?

755
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,050
It means he's retarded.

756
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,120
If you didn't know what you just went,

757
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,200
this is called a web.

758
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:22,800
A Web.

759
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,450
You got caught in a spiderweb,

760
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,190
the spiderweb of retardation.

761
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,020
It sticks to you and you're like,

762
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,741
oh my God,

763
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,660
I'm in this conversation
and I can't get out.

764
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,070
What the fuck did I do?

765
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:33,330
What did I engage him?

766
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,550
And you're trying to pull
yourself out of struggle,

767
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,290
but now you know we're into something.

768
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,520
What's going on?

769
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,170
I don't know why you're invested in this,

770
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,411
you know?

771
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,250
But what happened?

772
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,220
I'm just dating.

773
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,850
That's I guess the easiest way to say it.

774
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,770
I should say dating.

775
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,760
He's trying to,

776
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,593
you know,

777
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,611
I like you.

778
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:50,940
You know I'm not starving down.

779
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,650
You know I'm dating now.

780
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,940
That's what a girl says,

781
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,920
that she broke up with
a guy up to six months.

782
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:56,041
Well,

783
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,180
I'm starting to date.

784
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,303
You see what I mean?

785
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,671
Yeah,

786
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,000
I know.

787
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,090
Yeah.

788
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,550
I'm just trying not to jump
right into a relationship.

789
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,020
Very cool podcast here.

790
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,880
You can't use expressions like that.

791
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,310
Yeah,

792
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,143
you can't do,

793
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,801
you know,

794
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:08,491
and I like you,

795
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,070
we're friends.

796
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,990
What am I supposed to say?

797
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,263
You know,

798
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,870
I'm banging a few of them out,

799
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,713
right.

800
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,991
The show.

801
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:16,830
You know what I mean?

802
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,640
You know,

803
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,490
I throw a load this way.

804
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,090
I splurged all over this one before
I came to work just for a golf.

805
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,131
You know what I mean?

806
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:26,970
Things like that.

807
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:28,460
It needed the show.

808
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,770
You gotta realize you never got
to go back to this a podcast.

809
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:32,610
That's the beauty of that.

810
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,720
She can say what you want.

811
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,060
You never going to go back
to being an accountant again.

812
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,110
This will never haunt you.

813
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,580
It was he an accountant.

814
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,370
He used to sell computers.

815
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,150
Europe,

816
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,120
he's a good guy.

817
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,600
Very good guy.

818
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,060
But you know,

819
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,170
he's got to hit a mouthful.

820
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,840
It's a mass.

821
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:47,991
Well,

822
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:48,824
you're with them a lot,

823
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,740
but a mess and no doubt
that he's a great guy.

824
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:53,850
I'm just messing a good way.

825
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:54,690
Like what is,

826
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:55,261
what's going on?

827
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:55,420
I mean,

828
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,650
at one side of his mouth I'm pink,

829
00:19:58,651 --> 00:19:59,760
socking Asians,

830
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,590
making them pee a little.

831
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,670
But what I'm saying is
deciding your mouth.

832
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,970
You're talking about dating and on
the other side you're showing girls,

833
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,241
you know,

834
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,100
twisting themselves into pretzels.

835
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,930
But that wasn't really
like a sexual thing.

836
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,370
No,

837
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:13,591
no,

838
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:14,820
but it can be.

839
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,260
Yes,

840
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,620
because what he said,

841
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,810
that's what he saying.

842
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,120
Brian,

843
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,440
you just retarded yourself out.

844
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,850
Now you're cutting your own web,

845
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,130
your own weapons wrapped you right.

846
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,023
We'll leave him alone.

847
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,020
He's got it.

848
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,070
He's in his defense.

849
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,930
He's a very unusual dating situation.

850
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,620
It seems to be working out and he doesn't
want to talk about him in the air.

851
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,683
Right.

852
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,180
So what do you want to talk about
that we were talking about you.

853
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,030
We are,

854
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,770
we are,

855
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,150
um,

856
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,570
I try not to be so like crazy with myself.

857
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,980
I really tried to stay like grounded

858
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,270
in what I do because it does feel a little
crazy right now with what's going on.

859
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:54,970
Like you said about a resurgence and well,

860
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,460
you seem real excited
about comedy again to like,

861
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,740
you know,

862
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,540
you know what it is.

863
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,520
I've watched a lot of the specials and
when I spoke to showtime about this,

864
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,511
you know,

865
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:09,511
I had a couple of rules because I
even told my director a Scotsman Toya,

866
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,061
I said,

867
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:10,450
look,

868
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,390
you know you're going to
go through something now.

869
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,240
This isn't going to be like
the other specials you've done.

870
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,074
You're going to,

871
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,681
you know,

872
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:20,800
your head is going to change
color because of this.

873
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,311
You know,

874
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:22,870
you're going to go through it with me now.

875
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:26,050
You're going to be a different
man when you come through this.

876
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,670
And what was funny is

877
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,080
he,

878
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,540
when we were going to do the special,

879
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,310
he spoke to Joe does,

880
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,151
you know,

881
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:34,721
and he goes,

882
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:35,020
you know,

883
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,531
he taught me,

884
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:35,801
you know,

885
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:36,940
it goes to d as it goes,

886
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,361
you know,

887
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,130
I'm thinking of doing a special with dice,

888
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,880
what do you think?

889
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,271
And he goes,

890
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:43,330
well I think he's great but
you're going to go through it.

891
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,320
You know,

892
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
you know he's crazy when
it comes to these things.

893
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,343
And I am,

894
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,800
because all the way from the
performance to the editing,

895
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,990
I want it to be perfect.

896
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,580
I want people like,

897
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,420
like in a capsule because I really
don't want to do any more specials.

898
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:01,060
Like I'm going to do the road
now I'm just finishing up,

899
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,120
you know,

900
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,910
deal with the hard rock in Vegas,

901
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,200
a long term deal.

902
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,610
And you know,

903
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:08,530
I want to do what I do on the road.

904
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:09,010
Now.

905
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,950
What are you going to do at the hardrock?

906
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,170
Same thing you would do at the river.

907
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,590
Yeah.

908
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,423
Doing Monkey.

909
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,470
Uh,

910
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:13,691
yeah,

911
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm going to do like two
weeks at a clip and go into a,

912
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,220
uh,

913
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,820
what's the name?

914
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,653
Vinyl.

915
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,920
It's a rock club,

916
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,671
you know,

917
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,710
and like I said,

918
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,690
I base my act on rock and roll,

919
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,230
so I like a certain setting,

920
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,011
you know,

921
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,450
it's not that big of a room,

922
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:28,690
you know,

923
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,260
it's just there.

924
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,160
I was just in Vegas,

925
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:30,460
uh,

926
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,120
two weeks ago.

927
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,953
It's great.

928
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,370
The new hard rock is grain.

929
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,233
Well,

930
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,233
you know,

931
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:36,780
you know,

932
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,320
with what I do in that hotel,

933
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,400
it really fits.

934
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,090
And you know,

935
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,150
Vegas is somewhere I like to be a lot.

936
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,013
So,

937
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,291
you know,

938
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:44,801
on the road,

939
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:45,491
you know what it is,

940
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:47,260
you go into a couple thousand seats,

941
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:48,610
it's one time a year.

942
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,631
But Vegas,

943
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:51,220
I like doing like 20 weeks,

944
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,840
24 weeks a year.

945
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,951
And you know,

946
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,570
me and my wife just go nuts there.

947
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:56,860
We have a great time.

948
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:57,730
And you know,

949
00:22:57,731 --> 00:22:59,200
it's like a home away from home.

950
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,440
Why did you choose Vegas
to work out your shows?

951
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,320
Why'd you decide to do it
that way and not do it in la?

952
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:05,711
Well,

953
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:06,070
I was,

954
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,810
I was doing clubs around the country,

955
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,681
you know,

956
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,670
so I did that.

957
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,281
I did the,

958
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:10,601
you know,

959
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:11,520
like the governor's,

960
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,640
all those clubs,

961
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,151
you know,

962
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:13,450
but,

963
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,550
but Vegas was like a steady thing.

964
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,240
It was,

965
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,520
it almost became like my comedy store.

966
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,031
So,

967
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:19,360
you know,

968
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,390
I was at the Las Vegas Hilton
for a while working on it.

969
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,130
And then we went the Riv before the
Hilton and then we went back to the river

970
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,993
because I,

971
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,670
I was never into the room
at the Hilton to start with.

972
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:31,271
But you know,

973
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:31,810
you have,

974
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,171
you know,

975
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,004
I have a,

976
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,940
you know,

977
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,650
invest is in the show and you know,

978
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:36,484
we tried it,

979
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,460
but the river was a great room
to really just work it out,

980
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,140
do as long as set as I want,

981
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,520
and really just make everything
tight and develop the material with,

982
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,330
with an audience that's coming to see me.

983
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:50,840
So when you have the people
that are paying to come see you,

984
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,681
you know,

985
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,760
if the material is good,

986
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,960
because that's the fans.

987
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:56,810
Now when you go on places
like the comedy store,

988
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,970
you're going to get those
people that you know,

989
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,020
look at you and go,

990
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,550
what did he just say?

991
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,990
I want to leave now.

992
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:03,831
You know,

993
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,180
and I didn't want to deal with that.

994
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:06,680
I want the real audiences.

995
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,100
I thought that was a brilliant
idea to do it at the Riv,

996
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,530
uh,

997
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,010
for,

998
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,410
for that reason that you would
get all your people there,

999
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,590
but also because the place
has so much fucking history.

1000
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,030
Oh yeah.

1001
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,250
Such a crazy hotel.

1002
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,800
I get people that perform this,

1003
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,281
the,

1004
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:19,671
you know,

1005
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:20,660
from Sinatra,

1006
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,100
Sammy Davis to,

1007
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:22,760
uh,

1008
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,030
you know,

1009
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,340
comics like Milton Berle and you know,

1010
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:26,330
Jack Benny,

1011
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,711
who personally,

1012
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:30,530
I wasn't ever even fucking
in tow because like I say,

1013
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:31,364
I wasn't,

1014
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,390
I was never that much into standups.

1015
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,341
But you know,

1016
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:35,390
when you're on a stage that,

1017
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:35,601
you know,

1018
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,620
Sinatra was on,

1019
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:38,360
I did a lot of rooms like that in Vegas.

1020
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:40,570
I did 'em before they knocked it.

1021
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,503
Uh,

1022
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,210
what was the stardust?

1023
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,190
I did the status for a few years.

1024
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,730
Wow.

1025
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,640
And that was one of the best
stages because that stage,

1026
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,390
you know,

1027
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,030
you had the stage that you,

1028
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,130
you're on like this and then it had a,

1029
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,971
what's it called?

1030
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:59,600
Like a runway that went right
through the entire audience.

1031
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,060
And they don't build
stages like that anymore.

1032
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,790
So I was lucky enough to play some of
those Bally's hotel I did for 13 years.

1033
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,240
Isn't it crazy with those old Vegas
hotels that when they're done with them,

1034
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:12,440
they explode them?

1035
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,570
It's crazy because you know,

1036
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:15,404
I think,

1037
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,851
you know,

1038
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:16,220
pee,

1039
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,550
you know,

1040
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,550
I know a lot what goes on in Vegas and
like these people that just bought the

1041
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:24,980
Sahara want to make it like
more of a boutique hotel.

1042
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,814
Again,

1043
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,121
you know,

1044
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,460
for high role is not a lot of kids,

1045
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,091
you know,

1046
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:31,280
not a thousand floors up.

1047
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:31,941
You know,

1048
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:36,200
it was smaller place where people
really feel that old school Vegas feel.

1049
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,280
Right.

1050
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,960
And I also think they,

1051
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,990
this is really becoming
a place for comedy,

1052
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,831
not just comedy.

1053
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:45,860
Falive entertainment because of recession.

1054
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:46,071
You know,

1055
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:48,020
when people come to Vegas,

1056
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:48,980
if they're going to go to a show,

1057
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,780
they want to see somebody
familiar to them.

1058
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,500
Right.

1059
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:51,801
You know,

1060
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,380
so that's why a lot of
comics are moving there,

1061
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,280
you know?

1062
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,600
And that's why a lot of,

1063
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:56,871
you know,

1064
00:25:56,871 --> 00:26:00,800
you see people like share performing
that just sort of guns and roses there.

1065
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,610
You know,

1066
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,810
it's that type of place.

1067
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,950
Now they want to see
people that are fans of,

1068
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,090
they don't want to see just,

1069
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:08,361
you know,

1070
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:12,410
a bunch of midgets on Bungee cord
jumping around to the Beatles music.

1071
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,840
You know,

1072
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,760
you could probably do like a weekly
show in Vegas and never have to travel

1073
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:18,050
anywhere and just made people traveling.

1074
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,270
I want it to you.

1075
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,173
I want it to her,

1076
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:20,810
you know,

1077
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,130
I owe it to myself.

1078
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,910
I owe it to,

1079
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,870
to the fans that,

1080
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:24,620
you know,

1081
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,970
have been with me all these years.

1082
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm doing this a long time.

1083
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,800
So I really want to do
that big tour again.

1084
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,630
And I don't know how,

1085
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,290
how,

1086
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:33,651
you know,

1087
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:35,270
the kinds of rooms I'll do yet,

1088
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,201
but I mean,

1089
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,270
just on things that are on sale already,

1090
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:39,500
they're going through the roof,

1091
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,191
you know,

1092
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:41,420
and the special has an ed,

1093
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:42,860
but people know it's coming.

1094
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,160
And you know,

1095
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:45,420
ever since I did entourage,

1096
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:46,900
I have this whole new audience and,

1097
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:47,730
and they,

1098
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,780
and I'll always get that.

1099
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,550
When can I see a comedy special?

1100
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,840
You're doing a comedy special.

1101
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:54,030
So I really prepared for it.

1102
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:55,500
I really took it serious.

1103
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,371
You know,

1104
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:59,160
when I see guys preparing for specials,

1105
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,050
but just fucking around on stage,

1106
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,640
that bothers me.

1107
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,301
I'm like,

1108
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,800
they all want to be superstars.

1109
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:05,850
They all want to fill,

1110
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,150
you know,

1111
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,350
the staple center.

1112
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,540
But nobody's putting
in the work to do that,

1113
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,680
you know?

1114
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,180
And I know you're a hard worker.

1115
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:14,520
That's why I feel free
to tell you this stuff.

1116
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:18,270
And I know you give
everything you got on stage.

1117
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,410
I mean,

1118
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:19,920
you know,

1119
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,753
when,

1120
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,061
you know,

1121
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:21,840
it's funny,

1122
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,580
when I was coming up
you weren't run around,

1123
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,443
right.

1124
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,261
So you know,

1125
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:25,770
you had,

1126
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,120
you had myself,

1127
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,940
you had Sam Kennison who
was screaming his head off.

1128
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,960
And then one night I walk
into the store and I'm like,

1129
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,830
I'm seeing,

1130
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,071
you know,

1131
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,420
just style wise,

1132
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,020
almost a blend of Kennison
and me coming through you,

1133
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,290
but even more intense
when you would scream it.

1134
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,400
That's why I love them.

1135
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,563
I'm going,

1136
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,670
who the fuck is this?

1137
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,670
That the night I came in you were about,

1138
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,360
you know,

1139
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,410
deciding in your head.

1140
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:57,060
I could tell if you want to just smash
this guy's skull in and I'm going now.

1141
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,020
That's funny.

1142
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,071
You know what I mean?

1143
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:01,590
Because nobody came along since,

1144
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:01,980
you know,

1145
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,390
like I did an album called the data
left the died because Rick Rubin who

1146
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:07,980
produced five of my albums,

1147
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:08,221
you know,

1148
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,054
he did like,

1149
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:09,600
you know,

1150
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:09,831
he,

1151
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:10,230
he,

1152
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,870
he like he was the one that
brought wrap to the scene.

1153
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:15,820
He's the one that bought the
black Crowes and you know,

1154
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,190
bands like that.

1155
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:18,090
I mean he produced,

1156
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,511
you know,

1157
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,070
rolling stone albums,

1158
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,060
you know,

1159
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,410
and he say to me,

1160
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,870
you know it in the early nineties he'd go,

1161
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,160
you're the end of comedy.

1162
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,050
There's no way to go after this.

1163
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:28,980
You know,

1164
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,530
and then he has this maniac on stage.

1165
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,750
I mean I came in in the
middle of your acts.

1166
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,790
I had to like watch the way you walk,

1167
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,391
you know,

1168
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:37,710
because she would just,

1169
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,251
you know,

1170
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:40,410
this has got to be 15 years ago,

1171
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,660
maybe even more and you know,

1172
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:46,980
so you were so young and
just your face was beet red,

1173
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:47,970
you know,

1174
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,803
and I'm going,

1175
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,000
I know this guy,

1176
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,880
I didn't know your name cause I just
came walking in from the front door.

1177
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:54,840
I go,

1178
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,360
he's going to kill this
guy in the third row.

1179
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,860
And I don't know what over,

1180
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,090
it's a comedy show,

1181
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,130
but that's the shit that makes me laugh.

1182
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,780
And then one night,

1183
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,620
Eleanor,

1184
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,660
this is not even that long ago,

1185
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,240
I was destroying somebody in,

1186
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,781
you know,

1187
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,001
in,

1188
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:14,070
in the original room at the comedy
store and that's when you came up with,

1189
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,960
I love dice mean.

1190
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,430
And she told that to me.

1191
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:17,690
I go,

1192
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,371
does he really?

1193
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:18,581
He,

1194
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:19,350
she goes,

1195
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,430
he just loves you.

1196
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:24,180
And he loves when you get angry because
he knows you're really getting at,

1197
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,810
it was one of my favorite things at
the comedy store to be in the back.

1198
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:28,060
I would,

1199
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,390
we be,

1200
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,410
we'd be in the back talking and
someone would yell in the hallway,

1201
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,790
dice got a heckler.

1202
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,530
It's like we had a fish on,

1203
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,371
you know,

1204
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,410
it's like we got to now,

1205
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,201
you know,

1206
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:38,690
and we would all run in,

1207
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:43,600
in the back and just watch
you just eviscerate people
when you would get really

1208
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:44,890
mean when people look at you.

1209
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,230
Because I would really see,

1210
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,160
see I'm not fake on
stage and I'm emotional,

1211
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,460
so fun doing like a great
bit that I know is great.

1212
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,480
And in the middle of it,

1213
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,111
you know,

1214
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,390
I hear a guy yelling out little Bo peep.

1215
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,200
Yeah,

1216
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,210
I'm going to get angry at that person,

1217
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,260
you know?

1218
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,093
And uh,

1219
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,401
you know,

1220
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,590
it's not even about heckling that person.

1221
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,210
It's about knowing I've mentally
hurt him for years to come.

1222
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,590
But I like to know with great
timing and comedy scale,

1223
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,480
you got to stay with it.

1224
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:17,770
Yeah.

1225
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,410
But it's like you really want to
hurt the person I'm going to cross.

1226
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:22,244
You know what I mean?

1227
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,670
Now it's at the level
where we throw people out,

1228
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,450
you know,

1229
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:25,810
which,

1230
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,111
you know,

1231
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,730
first I'll have the heckle fight.

1232
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:27,851
Well,

1233
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,080
you did that in Vegas.

1234
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:29,540
You,

1235
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,610
you threw a guy out,

1236
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,690
the guy in the front row,

1237
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,100
two minutes into the show,

1238
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:35,740
the guy was so drunk he couldn't
even communicate with you.

1239
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,041
You like,

1240
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:36,874
this is not good.

1241
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,440
And I can't deal with that.

1242
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:38,831
It's like,

1243
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:39,970
why that drunk?

1244
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,991
I had a guy,

1245
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:44,230
I was at a governor's a few months ago.

1246
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,571
Do you remember this,

1247
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:47,081
Valerie?

1248
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,100
With the blind guy?

1249
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:48,940
Yeah.

1250
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,361
Okay.

1251
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:54,361
So this guy is just drunk and
he's wearing dark sunglasses.

1252
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,900
Just looking like a dice clone,

1253
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:56,734
you know,

1254
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,670
that guy's gotta be,

1255
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:57,881
you know,

1256
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,714
50,

1257
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,171
you know,

1258
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,010
or in his forties,

1259
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:00,790
whatever.

1260
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,100
So I'm going back and forth
with them a little bit,

1261
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:03,311
you know,

1262
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:03,761
I figured out,

1263
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,620
I'll always give a person a chance,

1264
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,120
but the guy now I get back into
the act and he starts in some more.

1265
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,230
So you know,

1266
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,681
you know,

1267
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,480
you got pretty tough bounces there,

1268
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:13,811
you know,

1269
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:14,410
and I go,

1270
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,131
do me a favor,

1271
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:17,650
get rid of this fucking
asshole of a human being.

1272
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:18,221
You know what I mean?

1273
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:19,780
Just throw them the fuck out.

1274
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,460
So now after the show,

1275
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:24,910
Don Jamison was opening for me that night
and he would sell his t shirts at the

1276
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:25,744
front of the club,

1277
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,583
you know,

1278
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,110
so he comes to the
dressing room and he goes,

1279
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,420
you just missed the greatest
thing I ever saw in comedy and go,

1280
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:34,601
why?

1281
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,111
What happened?

1282
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:35,890
He goes,

1283
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,221
you know,

1284
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:37,570
that guy you threw out,

1285
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,270
it took number one for bounces.

1286
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:41,830
He had like retarded strength.

1287
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,180
He goes,

1288
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,500
but he was blind,

1289
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,430
you know,

1290
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,500
and he was swinging his stick at them.

1291
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,400
He,

1292
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,240
he ran,

1293
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,440
he tried to run.

1294
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:55,030
And he smashed right into a wall and he
turned around and he was fighting these

1295
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:57,280
guys and he was winning.

1296
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,920
You know,

1297
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,210
going,

1298
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,550
he's coming back in the room,

1299
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,410
he's going to kick dices ass.

1300
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:02,921
I mean,

1301
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,540
that's what a comedy show is today.

1302
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,460
Who's going to kick somebody's ass?

1303
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,480
And I'm going,

1304
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,310
how the fuck did I know he's blonde.

1305
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,111
You know what I mean?

1306
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:11,411
The Guy,

1307
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:11,621
you know,

1308
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:15,730
I've had guys come to my show wearing
the glasses and the fingerless gloves.

1309
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,130
How am I going to know the guy?

1310
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:17,741
He's blind,

1311
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:17,981
you know?

1312
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,570
And then dragging them out of the room.

1313
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,690
He was starting to fight them
on the way out of the room,

1314
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,200
you know,

1315
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,760
which is entertaining to me,

1316
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,570
you know,

1317
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,160
this way I get to laugh a little,

1318
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:27,994
you know what I mean?

1319
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,511
You know?

1320
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:31,840
Why should the audience always be the
one to have a good laugh to make me

1321
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:32,740
fucking laugh,

1322
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,521
you know?

1323
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:34,570
So when Don told me,

1324
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,131
I went,

1325
00:32:35,131 --> 00:32:37,960
Don told me the story of the
blind guy really was laughing.

1326
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:39,220
It was very enjoyable.

1327
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,280
But the other side of me was I went to
throw him the guy out if I knew he was

1328
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:43,831
blind,

1329
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:44,121
that it,

1330
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:44,954
you know,

1331
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,883
how do you do that?

1332
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,490
You know,

1333
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,350
kicking a cripple that's a wheelchair.

1334
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,930
So was he hacking on w he was just,

1335
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:51,470
but it was,

1336
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,850
it was drunk and it was,

1337
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:53,871
you know,

1338
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,610
it wasn't coherent stuff.

1339
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:56,061
And I'm going,

1340
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:56,451
okay,

1341
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:56,711
ash,

1342
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:57,590
whole face,

1343
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,520
you know,

1344
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,001
which is,

1345
00:32:59,001 --> 00:32:59,270
uh,

1346
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,940
one of my newest Heco lines where,

1347
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,661
you know,

1348
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:04,550
if a guy's a real asshole,

1349
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,440
I'll tag them with that
name and I'll keep going,

1350
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,580
asshole face.

1351
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,850
And then I start getting angry and I go,

1352
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,030
I'm not saying you're an asshole.

1353
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:13,791
I go,

1354
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,180
I know you've been called that
a thousand times in your life.

1355
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,800
Goes to the kind of person you are.

1356
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,960
What I'm saying to you is,

1357
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:24,890
I think you have a face that
resembles a fucking asshole.

1358
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,340
And that's what I truly think of you.

1359
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,830
You know Damn Shit that you wake up in
the middle of the night when you go to

1360
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:31,490
take a leak.

1361
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:31,910
No.

1362
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,630
I'll tell you what happens
mentally when you say no,

1363
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:35,901
no,

1364
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:37,850
this is what happens with that c,

1365
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,980
let's say it's a guy in
Vegas with his friends.

1366
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:41,120
Hey asshole face.

1367
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:41,870
You know,

1368
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,240
so those friends that are with him now,

1369
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,760
these buddies of 20 years,

1370
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,590
you know that night they're
going to come on air.

1371
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,120
So face let's go have a drink.

1372
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,950
And it's funny the next day,

1373
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,540
even maybe even a week later,

1374
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,500
but three years later when the corner
house and the kids are picking up the

1375
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,930
phone to go and put ass
off face on the phone,

1376
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,430
that's when the guys call him.

1377
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,190
Why did I ever say a
fucking word at that show?

1378
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,850
Because now forever he's asshole face.

1379
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,220
That's a multi tiered solution.

1380
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,340
I like how you played that out,

1381
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,050
but I really think about that stuff.

1382
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:12,740
I go,

1383
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,170
what would hurt in the long run?

1384
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,730
That's like some humbling chest shit,

1385
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,350
right?

1386
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,183
Like if you call it,

1387
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,460
I've heard you call people and say,

1388
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:21,531
hey,

1389
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:22,880
you're a fucking asshole.

1390
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,150
They don't even hear it because
they've been called but to,

1391
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,670
but to tag them and let them know they
have a face that resembles an ace.

1392
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,380
No.

1393
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,860
Even if they don't just give them that,

1394
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:32,810
you know,

1395
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,640
normally the ones I pick out has it.

1396
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:35,840
And you know what I mean?

1397
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,250
I really looked for a guy that ha,

1398
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,160
I don't want to give a guy in
named that doesn't fit him.

1399
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,511
You know what I mean?

1400
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,990
So he's sort of Hash to
have a face that resembles,

1401
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:45,951
that's heckler.

1402
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,330
Herpes is what that's called.

1403
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:47,660
Yeah.

1404
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,660
It just keeps coming back to
haunt you because that's the fan.

1405
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,650
That was another time,

1406
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:55,510
you know,

1407
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,700
it,

1408
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,210
it's,

1409
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,481
you know,

1410
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,460
Max was with me and um,

1411
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,140
this,

1412
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,560
you know,

1413
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,550
this guy was fucking with Eleanor
on stage and his girlfriend I think,

1414
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:05,384
or his wife.

1415
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,960
So I come on stage and the
minute he opened his mouth,

1416
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:09,261
I'm like,

1417
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:10,730
throw this mother fucker around.

1418
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,301
Oh No.

1419
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:12,650
I wasn't on stage.

1420
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,410
And what happened was
I start yelling at the,

1421
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:16,244
uh,

1422
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,641
you know,

1423
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:17,680
the promoters of the shot.

1424
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,790
I go get that fucking guy out of the room.

1425
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,070
If he's bad with ty,

1426
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,640
he's not even gonna let me get started.

1427
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,850
But it wasn't good enough for
me that they throw him out.

1428
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,740
I come out the back door,

1429
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:28,820
I'm going to fight the guy,

1430
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,973
you know.

1431
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,390
Well Eleanor is stolen stage,

1432
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:32,601
you know,

1433
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,160
so I figured there's a little time,

1434
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,030
you know,

1435
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,920
and my wife Wa was yelling at your phone,

1436
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,230
is it my phone?

1437
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,481
What?

1438
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:42,030
Go fuck with these things.

1439
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:43,020
I don't know how he,

1440
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:43,891
unfortunately,

1441
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,650
I think you've also told that story.

1442
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,710
It's happy face,

1443
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,800
happy face.

1444
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,420
Yeah.

1445
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,080
And uh,

1446
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,410
wait,

1447
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,243
let me shut this.

1448
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,603
Who's happy things?

1449
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,010
Uh,

1450
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,420

1451
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,070
he's,

1452
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,710
he's with me for like 25 years already.

1453
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,760
He's a,

1454
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,920
he does security from it.

1455
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:59,070
He's into what you're into,

1456
00:35:59,580 --> 00:35:59,880
you know,

1457
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,361
with the fire.

1458
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:00,840
He's got,

1459
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,673
uh,

1460
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,040
you know,

1461
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,550
martial arts schools on the east
coast and his name's happy face.

1462
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:05,821
Well,

1463
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,860
it's names Mike Malandra,

1464
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,670
you know,

1465
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,020
but it's happy face.

1466
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,190
Everybody calls him happy for it.

1467
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:11,840
Yeah.

1468
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,360
Yeah.

1469
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,021
And you know,

1470
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:16,530
cause I'll always like tried to smile
at a guy when he's throwing them out and

1471
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,530
you know,

1472
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:17,930
he's,

1473
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,211
you know,

1474
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:19,560
he's a pretty deadly guy.

1475
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,500
And that's what I love
about him being happy face.

1476
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:23,670
I mean it's a great name.

1477
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,900
He got his job,

1478
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,770
you know how he got to get love,

1479
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:28,640
negative happy faces.

1480
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,360
A great fucking West.

1481
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,350
Also happy west as bad as good.

1482
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,860
Well happy faces with me like 25 years.

1483
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:42,861
And the way he got us the job was I would
work out in a gym in a Gold's gym in

1484
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:47,170
Jersey and we would just
start talking and you know,

1485
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:52,171
then we work out a little together
and he's happy faces about five,

1486
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:53,634
seven,

1487
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,690
you know.

1488
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,130
But he's not that big,

1489
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,700
you know.

1490
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,860
But he would talk about
his martial arts school.

1491
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:00,780
How his father taught him.

1492
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,830
They both had the school,

1493
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:02,131
you know,

1494
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:02,760
and he,

1495
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,120
you know,

1496
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,841
like you know,

1497
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:04,830
like a father,

1498
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:05,311
like son,

1499
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:06,630
he followed in his footsteps.

1500
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,170
So He's standing between
the two owners of the gym,

1501
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:11,610
which what animals?

1502
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,900
These guys were like,

1503
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:13,171
you know,

1504
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:16,080
the type that bench
three 50 a hundred times,

1505
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,400
you know,

1506
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,310
the big guys.

1507
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,530
So I said happy face.

1508
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,364
They go,

1509
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,421
you know,

1510
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:22,290
with my shows,

1511
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:22,801
I don't like,

1512
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:22,960
you know,

1513
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,660
we were talking about
him like working for me,

1514
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,730
cause I had club Soda
Kenny who's like six,

1515
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,930
five big,

1516
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,793
you know.

1517
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,850
And I said,

1518
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,220
so I looked at happy face
like he's the sniper,

1519
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,001
you know,

1520
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,140
they'd never see him coming.

1521
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:34,831
I go,

1522
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:36,360
but we don't like to hurt anybody.

1523
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,141
I go,

1524
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:38,430
so what I'm going to do,

1525
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,750
I'm going to try to get pissed,

1526
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:40,584
Jill,

1527
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,140
and you've got to stop
me without hurting me.

1528
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,540
And this guy put me down.

1529
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,130
My ass didn't even touch the ground.

1530
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,360
That's how fast he moved.

1531
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,890
But at first he's gone,

1532
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,360
I don't want to touch you.

1533
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:52,020
He goes,

1534
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,760
I came to the Meadowlands to see,

1535
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
you know,

1536
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:55,651
he goes,

1537
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:56,210
I can't,

1538
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:56,460
you know,

1539
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,731
I go,

1540
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:57,480
well that's the game.

1541
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,350
You can't hurt me.

1542
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,213
That's it.

1543
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,330
And he did this,

1544
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:00,870
move,

1545
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,290
this,

1546
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,160
this move on me.

1547
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:05,580
That just puts the department always
hurt you if you're resisting and hurt,

1548
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,630
you get hurt.

1549
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,470
Just scrambling.

1550
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,363
That's right.

1551
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,930
But he popped me down in that night.

1552
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:12,930
He was working for me and that
was the beginning of happy face.

1553
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,893
That's a nice name.

1554
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,530
I like it.

1555
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:16,771
Yeah.

1556
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:17,790
And I love his temper.

1557
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:18,810
When he gets mad.

1558
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,450
It's a lot of fun to make them get angry.

1559
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:21,631
You know,

1560
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:22,830
it's funny talking about like,

1561
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,530
cause he didn't like the
name Mike the Murderer.

1562
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,010
So that's fascinating.

1563
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:27,991
Well yeah,

1564
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:29,490
he starts screaming about that.

1565
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,720
Don't call me that,

1566
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,051
you know,

1567
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:32,460
it's a touchy situation,

1568
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,294
you know.

1569
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,081
You know what I'm calling,

1570
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:34,920
it's just a name.

1571
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:35,980
He but don't call me

1572
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,400
that,

1573
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,180
you know.

1574
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,511
Yeah.

1575
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,260
People don't want that murderous.

1576
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:39,770
No,

1577
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,650
but he's happy face for 25 years,

1578
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:42,760
so he's happy.

1579
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:46,390
But that's why he's calling me the comedy
store was always the worst place in

1580
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:50,200
the world for heckling because there
was no crowd control whatsoever.

1581
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,801
Nothing.

1582
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:51,310
Nothing.

1583
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:51,941
You would think.

1584
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:52,760
Like when I,

1585
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,060
when I lived in Boston
and we were at stitches,

1586
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,470
stitches is when,

1587
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:56,820
uh,

1588
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,450
that's where I did my first open mic.

1589
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,440
And uh,

1590
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,071
I had,

1591
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:00,340
uh,

1592
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,410
been really inspired by you,

1593
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,890
really inspired by a Kennison
and a few other guys.

1594
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:06,491
And I was,

1595
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:10,600
I was really like looking
forward to doing some,

1596
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,021
you know,

1597
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,760
trying to do some standup comedy.

1598
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:18,030
And you think back then like what the,

1599
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,670
what the face of comedy was
like and what it's like now.

1600
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,361
Yeah.

1601
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:26,830
See it's all like blank to me right
now and I'm not pitching on it,

1602
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,090
but I don't find,

1603
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:28,841
you know,

1604
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:30,200
I'll flip around the channels,

1605
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,390
just see if somebody is on,

1606
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:32,860
stopped watching for a few minutes.

1607
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,151
But like I say,

1608
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,030
these guys don't put a lot into their,

1609
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:36,864
um,

1610
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,290
into dead snow.

1611
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,630
There's nobody developing a persona,

1612
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,381
you know?

1613
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,340
And those are the kind,

1614
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,600
you might not realize it,

1615
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:44,590
but you'll have a persona.

1616
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,641
You know what I mean?

1617
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:47,110
People come to see Joe Rogan,

1618
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:48,220
they know what they're getting,

1619
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:48,880
you know,

1620
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,260
but there aren't too many guys.

1621
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:51,094
It's almost like,

1622
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,933
like,

1623
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,780
like white bread,

1624
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,651
you know,

1625
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:53,980
this,

1626
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,300
there's no persona up there.

1627
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:57,760
So even if the material's decent,

1628
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:58,631
you know,

1629
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:00,190
a lot of material has been done.

1630
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,290
A lot of guys covered the same subjects.

1631
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,350
I'd rather see a guy that's more
entertaining that I could go to.

1632
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:07,690
You fucking believe what
he's doing up there.

1633
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,030
That's the kind of act I like to see.

1634
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,450
When we were in Boston and we were
starting out and we're like looking at the

1635
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:14,171
face of comedy,

1636
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:16,450
the comedy store was always Maca.

1637
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,140
That was always like that fucking place
where you'd make the pilgrimage and

1638
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,300
everybody goes see the,

1639
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:25,510
these see this stage where you
performed the Kennison performance.

1640
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,940
Richard Pryor and let her,

1641
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,240
but when I got there and when I got there,

1642
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,910
like I forget who was on
stage with some road hack.

1643
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,451
Uh,

1644
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:34,661
the,

1645
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:34,841
the,

1646
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:37,250
the place was half fall and uh,

1647
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,450
some guy's yelling out shit in the back
of the room and no one's kicking them

1648
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:40,840
out.

1649
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,380
Nobody.

1650
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,981
And this was,

1651
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:46,300
this was like my first experience at
the commerce body guards at the Dorman,

1652
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,080
a comic.

1653
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,370
Nobody wants to get into it.

1654
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:48,911
Only Harris.

1655
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:49,551
Pete Harris.

1656
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:50,440
Pete would get down,

1657
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,001
get down,

1658
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:52,900
he would throw dudes out.

1659
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,150
I went to a Tony Danza knock him out.

1660
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:55,961
Oh really?

1661
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:56,240
Yeah,

1662
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,100
because you know how
condescending Harrison,

1663
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,900
you guys,

1664
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,810
Tony Danza box just wanted to come in.

1665
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,350
Yeah.

1666
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:02,880
Nicest.

1667
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,540
Kobe.

1668
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:03,790
You know,

1669
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,060
Tom,

1670
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,781
I don't know if you know,

1671
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:07,150
but he's just this friendly guy,

1672
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,680
kick ass,

1673
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,573
you know.

1674
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,540
And Harris gave him a hard time
and he put his hands on him.

1675
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,030
Uh,

1676
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,301
you know,

1677
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:17,500
like you can't just walk in and he just
gave them one shot and he went flying

1678
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,460
down the stairs.

1679
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,000
Wow.

1680
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,833
Really funny.

1681
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,441
Poor,

1682
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:21,310
really enjoyable.

1683
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,610
Harris's such an angry
guy for whatever reason.

1684
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:25,421
He's such an angry guy.

1685
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:30,130
It took me a year to get even the
tiniest compliment from that guy.

1686
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:30,671
Yeah,

1687
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:31,504
that's it.

1688
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,250
Negative,

1689
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:34,910
negative.

1690
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,061
Yeah.

1691
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,130
He just left the world he liked,

1692
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:38,660
just got on his motorcycle.

1693
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,300
But I do have to say when
the guy gave you props,

1694
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:42,134
it meant something,

1695
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,980
you know,

1696
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,320
I for some reason it did the back well,

1697
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,700
it would like him to be a
little bit more fair with them.

1698
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,040
You know what I'm saying?

1699
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:52,874
What you know,

1700
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,420
it's like getting a compliment from him
was like getting one from Mitzi for some

1701
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:59,870
reason it was called what it is cause
he was always there and he saw everybody

1702
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:00,380
before.

1703
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,080
That's true too.

1704
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,520
You know,

1705
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,360
whether or not to be
impressed with you or not,

1706
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,420
or whether or not you are
just bullshit in the crowd.

1707
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,040
But he was also just negative,

1708
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,510
but also the comedy store,

1709
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,441
I think,

1710
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:09,711
you know,

1711
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,030
somebody like you would like it.

1712
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,530
And myself was,

1713
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,720
that was the bad boy comedy club.

1714
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,733
It still is.

1715
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,470
You know,

1716
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,320
it's like you say it's a free for all.

1717
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:19,490
You go over to the Improv,

1718
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:20,600
which is a great club,

1719
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,321
but it's,

1720
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:24,320
everything is run at the comedy store.

1721
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:25,910
Nobody even knows who's running things,

1722
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:26,690
any madness.

1723
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,880
And it was more madness
then than it is now.

1724
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,680
I think it's probably a way better
managed now than it was back in the early

1725
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:33,980
days.

1726
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,760
But man,

1727
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,660
it was insane.

1728
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,300
But when I came along it was 94.

1729
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,980
That's when I was first
started performing there.

1730
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,580
And uh,

1731
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,413
I just,

1732
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,350
I was blown away,

1733
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,020
but it was like the
place was like crackling.

1734
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,710
It's like the magic of all those sets
in the walls and with the store you ever

1735
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:50,060
noticed.

1736
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,290
You could go there some nights,

1737
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:51,560
you know,

1738
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,191
the Sunday,

1739
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:53,001
Monday nights,

1740
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:55,130
and it's as fun as could be.

1741
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:55,964
And crazy.

1742
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,820
And then there were certain nights
when you come there like that.

1743
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,280
And just the vibe is bad.

1744
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,380
Just the wrong combination
of people that you go,

1745
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,540
you know what I'm getting at here.

1746
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,960
It's just that bad fucking vibe.

1747
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,420
And then just other nights just insane.

1748
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:15,254
Great.

1749
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:15,801
Yeah.

1750
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,510
It's an amazing club.

1751
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,170
You know,

1752
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,250
just the history.

1753
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,211
I still love it.

1754
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:21,300
I still love going there.

1755
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:22,910
I still love going on the stage.

1756
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,420
Yeah.

1757
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,420
I can't go back because of the
falling out that I had with them.

1758
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,323
I didn't know about that.

1759
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,880
The dementia issue,

1760
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,690
you didn't know,

1761
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,960
but you're not allowed back courses.

1762
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,791
I never went back.

1763
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,070
I never would go back when they,

1764
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:34,251
uh,

1765
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:35,330
they banned me from that and I'm like,

1766
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,500
you guys are out of your fucking mind.

1767
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:36,650
Yeah.

1768
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,950
But if he weren't banned then
you wouldn't be a comedy store.

1769
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:39,290
Ma,

1770
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,240
I got bandwidth for that Mitzi band.

1771
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:44,150
Maybe once for my j Howard Marshall Joke.

1772
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,880
I had this joke about,

1773
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:47,450
uh,

1774
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,950
about the old dude that,

1775
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:49,520
uh,

1776
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,090
that fucked and Nicole Smith and
I was one of my favorite jokes.

1777
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,080
It's a quick joke.

1778
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:54,914
She hated it.

1779
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,480
It was just about,

1780
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:56,830
you know,

1781
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:57,530
that everyone was saying,

1782
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:57,801
oh,

1783
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,520
it's such a,

1784
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,770
it's so sad to watch his poor old man,

1785
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,371
you know,

1786
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,204
and like,

1787
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,851
like he's,

1788
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:03,531
he's getting,

1789
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:06,230
he's getting robbed and this
woman's just here for his money.

1790
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:06,620
And I'm like,

1791
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,830
don't you think he knows
that was 90 years old.

1792
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,930
He made $1 billion from scratch.

1793
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,141
You know,

1794
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:13,850
chances are he's a tad crafty.

1795
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,990
Like how do you want him to die?

1796
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:16,760
And then it was this whole death scenario,

1797
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,730
like on you go off to
a bunch of dirty shit.

1798
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,870
And I love the bit,

1799
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,560
but it was a lie.

1800
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,690
It was about old people.

1801
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,760
She did not like it.

1802
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,430
And I think she banned me once for that.

1803
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,460
She banned me wants or something else too,

1804
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,680
but it will only take a little time.

1805
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,260
My kids were even banned from there.

1806
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,130
I had

1807
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,510
a thing with Paula years ago,

1808
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:35,730
like when I first broke up with my wife,

1809
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,451
you know,

1810
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:40,500
I'd always bring my kids to the
comedy store at night and you know,

1811
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,640
Eleanor would hang with them,

1812
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,503
you know,

1813
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,920
so one night,

1814
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,341
you know,

1815
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:45,210
I mean Dylan,

1816
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,230
who's now 18,

1817
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,471
you know,

1818
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:48,750
it was only 11 you know,

1819
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,231
and you know,

1820
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:49,571
I'm seeing,

1821
00:44:49,571 --> 00:44:54,571
I'm pulling in the comedy pulley had a
hamburger joint when he was 12 years old

1822
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:56,100
at the Westwood comedy store.

1823
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,130
So I know Paulie grown
up since he's that age.

1824
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,480
So he goes,

1825
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,860
how many times I got to tell you,

1826
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:03,420
don't bring your fucking kid in here.

1827
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,680
You know?

1828
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,513
And I was like,

1829
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,020
I already said that like that.

1830
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,220
But he was standing there,

1831
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,951
my kid was there,

1832
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:09,600
so I go,

1833
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,110
Dylan,

1834
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:10,650
I forgot,

1835
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,930
I think he was with Steve Simone.

1836
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,091
I go,

1837
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:12,451
Steve,

1838
00:45:12,451 --> 00:45:13,350
take them outside.

1839
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,400
You know,

1840
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,940
I go,

1841
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,720
you know,

1842
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,670
like I was going to have
to hurt him at that moment,

1843
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,361
you know,

1844
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:19,194
but I didn't want,

1845
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:19,471
you know,

1846
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:19,751
but I,

1847
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:20,460
I got,

1848
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,660
I didn't get physical,

1849
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:21,901
you know,

1850
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,100
you can't do that stuff,

1851
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,330
but poorly told his mother
that I threw a glass at him.

1852
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,760
So she banned me and the kids,

1853
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,810
you know,

1854
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,441
my kids were,

1855
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:34,150
Ben did 11 and 15 from the comment,

1856
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,981
which is so great.

1857
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:37,980
I go and my son Max loved
it because he understood it.

1858
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:39,510
He was old enough to understand it.

1859
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:40,670
And uh,

1860
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,880
and then one night Mitzi comes in and
Illinois was sitting with a and saying,

1861
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,151
no,

1862
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:45,331
no,

1863
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:46,410
that's not what happened.

1864
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,060
I was right in the
kitchen when it happened.

1865
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:49,590
He didn't throw a glass of poorly.

1866
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,371
She goes,

1867
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:50,911
if anything,

1868
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:53,040
he would have caved
his skull and you know,

1869
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,830
he just threw the glass in
the garbage on his way out.

1870
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:56,701
And she,

1871
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:57,091
you know,

1872
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:57,550
her voice,

1873
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:57,990
she's,

1874
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,171
well,

1875
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,960
I knew that Andrew went
through something like that.

1876
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:01,261
You know,

1877
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,280
he wouldn't go to that level.

1878
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,561
Yeah.

1879
00:46:02,561 --> 00:46:04,020
You wouldn't know.

1880
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,830
I would never,

1881
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:05,663
I was never,

1882
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,030
you know,

1883
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:06,930
that's not what I do.

1884
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,130
I can see you hitting somebody.

1885
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:08,730
Yeah.

1886
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,000
Well,

1887
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,833
you know,

1888
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,200
but I can't hit somebody
unless they try to hurt me.

1889
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:13,771
You know,

1890
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,490
it was more like I just laid into him
for it and on the way out of the kitchen,

1891
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:18,324
the back door,

1892
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,610
like through my glass
and it broke on the wall,

1893
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,151
you know,

1894
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:22,470
and the other garbage can there.

1895
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,900
But Paulie was out in the hallway.

1896
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:25,950
He was nowhere near it.

1897
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:26,671
But it was,

1898
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:27,041
you know,

1899
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:27,721
and we made up,

1900
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:28,111
of course,

1901
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:29,460
we're friends today and you know,

1902
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:31,110
we laugh about all the nonsense,

1903
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,160
but you know,

1904
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,780
it's just a crazy place.

1905
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,390
I mean sometimes tend to
show you would love this.

1906
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:37,560
You weren't even out there yet.

1907
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:38,731
This is like,

1908
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:43,731
I'm talking like 86 87 so me and Kennison
would be the last acts of the night.

1909
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:47,070
Every night she'd put us on back to back.

1910
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:51,990
And it was either he went on first or I
went on first and like to end the show.

1911
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,940
Sometimes if he'd go on first,

1912
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,541
you know,

1913
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,560
I'd be on stage.

1914
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:55,951
And you know,

1915
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:57,180
once he'd get bored with it,

1916
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,830
he'd throw a chair at me on stage and
then the whole fight would happen on the

1917
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:05,460
stage with called the would jump and
you would just see who's ever in the

1918
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:07,830
audience because the
audience is terrorists.

1919
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,420
They don't know what's going on.

1920
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:09,901
They don't know.

1921
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:10,500
You know,

1922
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,210
I'm falling over the front tables
knocking people love and people are just

1923
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:16,650
running out of the place.

1924
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,480
Like what the fuck is this?

1925
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:19,860
Like all breaks loose.

1926
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,900
There was so many great fake fights at
the comedy store cause that's the one

1927
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:26,070
thing comics lift to do.

1928
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:27,360
We love being children.

1929
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,233
Todd Barron,

1930
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,180
Tom like the king

1931
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,780
of that Shit.

1932
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,250
Let's talk to him last night about you.

1933
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:34,050
He loves you to death and uh,

1934
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:34,801
he's like,

1935
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:35,550
you should bring it up.

1936
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,480
How he used to,

1937
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,370
did he used to go on the
road with you or did you

1938
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,153
dawn,

1939
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,710
I would put don in whatever I was in,

1940
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,610
I would put him in,

1941
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,360
like,

1942
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,800
we wound up doing this,

1943
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,760
this crazy frank Stallone movie in Ixtapa,

1944
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,020
you know,

1945
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,260
uh,

1946
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,050
Mexico and we were stuck
there for like five weeks.

1947
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,280
And of course I made,

1948
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:59,030
I made dawn do like Alfred
Hitchcock and the movie,

1949
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,580
there was no call for Alfred Hitchcock,

1950
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,380
but I talked to producers into it,

1951
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:04,790
you know,

1952
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,200
and that's where he actually hurt,

1953
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,160
hurt his foot.

1954
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,620
You know how he's got like a bad foot.

1955
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,070
Yeah,

1956
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:10,761
he hurt his foot.

1957
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:11,000
Well,

1958
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,410
what happened with don?

1959
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:14,000
He always wants to fight me,

1960
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:14,721
you know,

1961
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:15,554
so,

1962
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,690
so one day,

1963
00:48:17,691 --> 00:48:18,081
you know,

1964
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:22,460
he starts in with me on the set and
it's all these Mexican crew members that

1965
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:23,990
don't even understand English.

1966
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,770
And he puts his foot like there was a
hole in the ground and he wouldn't go to

1967
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:30,620
the hospital after to fix it,

1968
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,520
you know?

1969
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,720
So to this day,

1970
00:48:32,721 --> 00:48:35,600
like he just moves the
wrong way and he's crippled,

1971
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,291
you know,

1972
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,470
he just falls down.

1973
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,840
And it was funny.

1974
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:44,260
What happened was I went back to a
Madison Square Garden in 2000 and it was

1975
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:49,730
Don's job at the time to come there
because he really wants to see it with my

1976
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:50,990
wife and my sons.

1977
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,740
So he was the problem on the plane because
what happened was he's walking down

1978
00:48:57,201 --> 00:49:00,070
an aisle and the foot goes and he's,

1979
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:00,430
you know,

1980
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,370
Don's emotional,

1981
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:01,940
you know,

1982
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,260
so he's screaming,

1983
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:06,710
laying on the floor and the flame scaring,

1984
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,560
scaring the entire flight,

1985
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,520
you know,

1986
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,490
and then they get him into a
chair and the foot felt better,

1987
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,121
you know,

1988
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:18,530
so it was that the cops were at the
airport to question him and I go,

1989
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,260
you a job was to just bring them here.

1990
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:22,280
That was the gift.

1991
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:25,370
You get to fly for nothing
and get a hotel room,

1992
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,270
bring them in and you cause a
problem on the fucking airline.

1993
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,680
But that's done.

1994
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,130
You know,

1995
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,990
that's who he is.

1996
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,500
You think he was his practical jokes?

1997
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,310
No.

1998
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,143
He was

1999
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,300
laying at norms.

2000
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:37,571
No,

2001
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:38,404
no,

2002
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,823
no.

2003
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,770
Really goes,

2004
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,480
his foot really goes,

2005
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:43,770
is it a broken foot?

2006
00:49:43,771 --> 00:49:44,604
Is it a ligament?

2007
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,070
I'm sure he'd like chips,

2008
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,990
something in his ankle and he
just wouldn't go to the house.

2009
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:49,321
He goes,

2010
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:49,471
well,

2011
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:50,430
they're going to do to me,

2012
00:49:50,431 --> 00:49:50,670
you know,

2013
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,290
he turns into this baby,

2014
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,813
you know?

2015
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,301
Oh yeah.

2016
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:55,620
And he would do the road with me,

2017
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:56,041
you know,

2018
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:58,880
and I had it when he
would do the road with,

2019
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,080
I would just take them with
me when he would do the road.

2020
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:01,914
I had a,

2021
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,440
at that time I had Eddie Griffin with me.

2022
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,371
I had,

2023
00:50:05,371 --> 00:50:05,700
yeah.

2024
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,650
So Eddie Griffin was like the real open,

2025
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:08,670
you know.

2026
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,080
And so what would happen is I'd
give Don 10 minutes right upfront.

2027
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,410
So we'd be on a big tour bus,

2028
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:17,610
traveling the country.

2029
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,370
And one time he's on
the bus and he's like,

2030
00:50:20,371 --> 00:50:22,140
you know how he gets down on himself,

2031
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:22,771
you know,

2032
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:26,130
like almost like that he's
not crying with tears,

2033
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:27,990
but I'm going down.

2034
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,730
It's because the crowd doesn't
respond the way he wants.

2035
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:32,510
You know,

2036
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,890
cause he would come out singing,

2037
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,930
tie a yellow ribbon,

2038
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,153
you know,

2039
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,710
you know,

2040
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,290
with,

2041
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:41,390
with the music over it and
get the crowd clapping.

2042
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:44,690
And so now the song ends and
then he goes into another one.

2043
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:46,310
It'll go into like Copa Cabana.

2044
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,220
So now he's on the bus
complaining about that.

2045
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:49,761
Go Don,

2046
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:54,350
it's your 10 minutes after they get the
joke of who you are that you're this

2047
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,730
fucking goofball.

2048
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,680
Well now where are the jokes?

2049
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,641
You know?

2050
00:50:58,641 --> 00:50:59,510
And he would go,

2051
00:50:59,511 --> 00:50:59,751
well,

2052
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:00,081
you know,

2053
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:00,950
I went into the other,

2054
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:01,371
so I go,

2055
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,480
they don't want to hear another,

2056
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:03,830
you already did the big,

2057
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,150
you had them clap.

2058
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:07,640
Now they've got a clap
to Barry Manilow singing,

2059
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:08,200
you know,

2060
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,140
Copa Cabana,

2061
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:10,310
who gives a fuck?

2062
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:11,991
You know what I mean?

2063
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:13,250
And nobody gives a fuck.

2064
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,930
You create the character,

2065
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:18,320
you just fucking big goofball
and now give him jokes,

2066
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,281
you know?

2067
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:19,790
And,

2068
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,120
but we had a lot of fun and then that
would be another rumble on the bus.

2069
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,170
Now it's in jumping on me and
trying to kill me on the bus.

2070
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:27,561
Yeah,

2071
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:30,100
he's in his life is constant
theater with that guy.

2072
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:30,920
I didn't,

2073
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,590
did I,

2074
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:36,590
that's who I hang out with every single
day from midnight to about 4:00 AM Tom

2075
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,043
Barrett.

2076
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:38,581
And,

2077
00:51:38,581 --> 00:51:38,791
you know,

2078
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,110
it was hysterical with the movie.

2079
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:41,310
We did an extensive,

2080
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,710
but uh,

2081
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,090
date they want them to stay
and film for longer than I,

2082
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,350
I wanted to be there,

2083
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:48,251
you know,

2084
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:48,730
and I'm gone.

2085
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,541
I gotta get Outta here.

2086
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:50,171
I got gigs,

2087
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:50,831
I got to dose.

2088
00:51:50,831 --> 00:51:52,690
So they promised me a lot of,

2089
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:53,583
a lot of money,

2090
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:54,430
you know,

2091
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,010
in like cash and in Taiwan,

2092
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:58,301
you know,

2093
00:51:58,301 --> 00:51:59,530
through the whole shoot is going,

2094
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,790
they're never giving it to you.

2095
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,170
You've got to get it now.

2096
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,861
I got done,

2097
00:52:02,861 --> 00:52:03,700
they're going to pay me.

2098
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:04,570
We made a deal.

2099
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:05,404
That's it.

2100
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,120
You know,

2101
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,610
Eh,

2102
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:07,060
you know,

2103
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,470
and you know,

2104
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,070
the,

2105
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,750
it was a crazy set,

2106
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,141
you know,

2107
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:11,471
I mean,

2108
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:13,930
I never went through anything
like this in a film ever.

2109
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,540
You know what went on in those five weeks.

2110
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,160
And so he's gone,

2111
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,461
you know,

2112
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:19,330
two to five weeks.

2113
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:20,920
I've got to hear how
they're not going to pay me,

2114
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:21,191
you know,

2115
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:22,480
he's just on me that the,

2116
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,870
and of course they give me the
money and dawn had a tape it up,

2117
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,831
you know,

2118
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:27,850
all over my body.

2119
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,950
Like that movie midnight express it.

2120
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:30,610
You Willing?

2121
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:30,851
Yeah.

2122
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:31,750
Because you know,

2123
00:52:31,751 --> 00:52:36,751
it was a part of Mexico that we actually
thought that the director was going to

2124
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:37,141
happen.

2125
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:38,500
He stopped at the airport,

2126
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:39,551
you know,

2127
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,050
so you know,

2128
00:52:41,051 --> 00:52:41,640
with thinking,

2129
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:41,921
all right,

2130
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:42,400
how am I going,

2131
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,070
cause you're not allowed more
than like $10,000 in cash.

2132
00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:46,780
And this was a lot of money,

2133
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:47,531
you know?

2134
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,910
So he was taping it with this
like paper tape to my chest,

2135
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,110
to my thoughts.

2136
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:54,470
You know,

2137
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,990
that when I got home,

2138
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:56,720
you know,

2139
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,510
and when we're going through the airport,

2140
00:52:58,511 --> 00:52:58,900
I'm gone,

2141
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,800
they're going to stop me,

2142
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,130
I'm going to be in jail and whoever
stops and he's going to be rich,

2143
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:03,821
you know,

2144
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:04,780
it's that simple.

2145
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,100
But they didn't stop us.

2146
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:11,101
And now I get home and I take off my shirt
and my wife sees all this money taped

2147
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:12,970
to my chest and she's going,

2148
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,350
what is that?

2149
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,611
You know?

2150
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:16,121
And I'm going,

2151
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:16,361
no,

2152
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:17,260
they paid me.

2153
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,123
You know,

2154
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,620
that's how they pay you in Mexico,

2155
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:21,903
you know?

2156
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,450
But Tom was just so sure
they're not paying for them.

2157
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,830
It was just crazy.

2158
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:27,490
It was,

2159
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,323
I wouldn't eat,

2160
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:31,990
we only had one meal a day because
everybody on the set was getting sick.

2161
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:32,681
You know,

2162
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:37,120
everybody was going to the hospital
and it and all we had every day was um,

2163
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,060
we went to the same restaurant
about four o'clock every day.

2164
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:42,970
We had pasta with sauce,

2165
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:48,510
garlic bread and Coca Cola would purified
ice and we wouldn't eat until the next

2166
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,840
day at the same time.

2167
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,080
Cause we figured we'd make it the middle
of the day because we're only getting

2168
00:53:53,081 --> 00:53:53,771
that one meal.

2169
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:55,600
We're not eating any of the food there.

2170
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,350
Wow.

2171
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:56,591
Yeah.

2172
00:53:56,591 --> 00:53:58,600
And he lost like 30 pounds.

2173
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,530
Fine.

2174
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,220
He's,

2175
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:00,760
he's gone.

2176
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,810
I got to eat something,

2177
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,390
you know,

2178
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,223
he's going,

2179
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,520
this is ridiculous step.

2180
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,640
We're not eating food,

2181
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:07,474
you know,

2182
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,400
but everybody's fallen at the waist side.

2183
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,121
What are we going to do?

2184
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:10,740
We got no chick.

2185
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,740
This is survival.

2186
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:12,400
My friend.

2187
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,730
Those be movie sets can
be very fucking sketchy.

2188
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,410
And it was for a long time.

2189
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,040
Was it five weeks of the same food?

2190
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,113
But I'm a kid.

2191
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,530
I could do that.

2192
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,140
I could eat the same
thing every single day.

2193
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,270
But you want it like twice a day,

2194
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:30,520
but the restaurant would
close like nine at night,

2195
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:34,360
so we'd have to wait until the next day
at four o'clock to have the next meal.

2196
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:35,703
Wow.

2197
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,210
Bottled water,

2198
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,021
you know?

2199
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:38,854
And that was it.

2200
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,290
Bottled water and pasta once a day.

2201
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,670
What's the name of this movie?

2202
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,080
It was called the good life.

2203
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:44,923
It never came out,

2204
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:46,061
you know?

2205
00:54:46,061 --> 00:54:47,590
And I always talked to frank Stallone.

2206
00:54:47,591 --> 00:54:50,650
He always says he should release
like pieces of it on the Internet.

2207
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,503
Yeah.

2208
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,500
It was the craziest thing,

2209
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,060
you know?

2210
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,893
Uh,

2211
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,800
I wanted it to be a comedy.

2212
00:54:56,801 --> 00:54:58,900
Frank Stallone wanted it to be a drama,

2213
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:00,640
you know,

2214
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,473
because,

2215
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,250
because,

2216
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:02,470
you know,

2217
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,610
I would tell the producers,

2218
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:03,971
I go,

2219
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:04,330
you know,

2220
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,920
it's really a funny movie,

2221
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,620
you know,

2222
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,990
and comedy cells,

2223
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,350
right?

2224
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,360
So when frank would do a scene,

2225
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,910
he'd come over to the director and go,

2226
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:13,750
you know,

2227
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,381
how was that?

2228
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:15,100
And he goes,

2229
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,401
well,

2230
00:55:15,401 --> 00:55:16,870
it was very dramatic,

2231
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,213
you know,

2232
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:18,910
and he's gone,

2233
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:19,061
well,

2234
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:20,200
it's supposed to be a drama.

2235
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:20,621
And he goes,

2236
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:21,041
well,

2237
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,360
I think it should be funnier.

2238
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,381
And he goes,

2239
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:25,630
but the movie's a fucking drama.

2240
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,291
Like,

2241
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,550
so he was flipping out at,

2242
00:55:27,551 --> 00:55:29,070
we had a big fight over that movie,

2243
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,913
but uh,

2244
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,890
but the producers now want
to just be like a comedy.

2245
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,060
Dennis Hopper's in it.

2246
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,320
It was supposed to be,

2247
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:36,250
you know what it was supposed to be.

2248
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:39,280
It was supposed to be
Goodfellas on a golf course.

2249
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,570
So Dennis Hopper,

2250
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,100
Dennis Hopper was in it,

2251
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,360
but it was filming.

2252
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:44,194
Really.

2253
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,580
Can you find it anywhere?

2254
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:47,530
It's snow would be,

2255
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,430
but it doesn't,

2256
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:48,581
yeah.

2257
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:49,450
It's not online,

2258
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,640
but no one put it online.

2259
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,170
But David Carradine was in it too.

2260
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:53,800
Yeah.

2261
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,430
A lot of people were in the Angelos
investors to the loans in it.

2262
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,170
That's hilarious.

2263
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,010
And he never made it.

2264
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,040
You should never know shit to
Netflix or something like that.

2265
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:03,450
You'll make it.

2266
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,120
It's,

2267
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,301
well,

2268
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:05,500
it's not my movie to sell,

2269
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:06,730
but you know,

2270
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,990
it just wound up,

2271
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:10,540
the whole time in Ixtapa was drama,

2272
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,411
you know?

2273
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,380
But it,

2274
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,720
the movie's hysterical.

2275
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,673
You know,

2276
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,600
it was just movie sets.

2277
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,830
I've only been on one.

2278
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,670
I've been on well to be movie movies.

2279
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,680
But you know what happened?

2280
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,660
We had a good director at the beginning,

2281
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,900
and then the producer who was an attorney
fired the director and he decided to

2282
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:30,970
direct a no.

2283
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,070
So now what happens is,

2284
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,080
this is where it starts
going a little crazy.

2285
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:35,981
Uh,

2286
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:36,371
and I,

2287
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:36,641
you know,

2288
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:37,540
I can't play golf.

2289
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:38,680
I hate fucking golf.

2290
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,470
I don't have patients to
hit a one little ball,

2291
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:41,801
you know,

2292
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:42,970
of course the park,

2293
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:43,804
whatever,

2294
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,833
you know.

2295
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,200
So I wasn't really good
at playing the golf,

2296
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:47,501
you know,

2297
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:49,360
so we would make it that
they make fun at me,

2298
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:52,210
but I had some like golf
material at the time.

2299
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,680
We had talked about hating golf.

2300
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,270
So the,

2301
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:56,104
the,

2302
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:01,180
this new director makes me do some of
that material on like the mass to shot,

2303
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,170
like on a crane.

2304
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,341
So he goes,

2305
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:05,470
I want you to do that
monologue every time,

2306
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,551
you know?

2307
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:07,150
And I go,

2308
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:07,331
no,

2309
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:09,960
but I'm not doing that monologue
every time I did a few,

2310
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,310
cause you asked me to do
it in the mass of the shot,

2311
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:13,750
just so you get some talking.

2312
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,130
And he goes,

2313
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:15,341
no,

2314
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:15,961
I want you to do it.

2315
00:57:15,961 --> 00:57:16,181
I go,

2316
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:17,740
that's my material from my act.

2317
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:18,580
I don't want to do it.

2318
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:19,361
You know,

2319
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:20,860
you're not paying me for it all year.

2320
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,150
And he goes,

2321
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,160
you'll do what I say.

2322
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,880
I'm not going to do a fucking thing.

2323
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:25,714
You say,

2324
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,270
I go and don't ever tell
me what to do again.

2325
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,070
Ever in front of the camera.

2326
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:34,780
Which Dom Barris is falling down laughing
as he's making a little documentary

2327
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:35,920
movie with my camera,

2328
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,220
because I was always filming.

2329
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:37,541
He did.

2330
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:38,351
He literally say,

2331
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,370
you'll do as I say,

2332
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:39,790
yeah,

2333
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,601
whoever lands.

2334
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:41,434
And he goes and he,

2335
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,160
and he says,

2336
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,971
if you don't like it,

2337
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:43,804
you could leave.

2338
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:44,500
So I said,

2339
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:44,831
okay,

2340
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:45,281
I'll leave.

2341
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:45,881
I go done.

2342
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:46,361
Let's go.

2343
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:47,590
And I had calypso to Kenny.

2344
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:47,741
They,

2345
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:48,011
I go,

2346
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:48,700
let's say.

2347
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,121
He goes,

2348
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:49,271
well,

2349
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:50,500
my attorneys will be in touch.

2350
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:50,930
I go,

2351
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:51,763
asshole,

2352
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,820
you told me to leave to say
you don't want me in the movie.

2353
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:57,910
If I don't want to do my own
material and I don't want to do it,

2354
00:57:57,911 --> 00:58:01,480
so don't fucking tell me what to
do and I'll stay and that's it.

2355
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,530
You know?

2356
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,720
And what don loved is,

2357
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,400
no matter what the guy did,

2358
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:06,731
you know,

2359
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:07,960
for his main profession,

2360
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:08,770
he goes,

2361
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,420
you're telling you a director,

2362
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,450
the guy that supposed
to tell you what to do,

2363
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,820
don't ever tell me what to do again,

2364
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,930
but that is only job right
now is telling you what to do.

2365
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:20,441
I go,

2366
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:20,651
yeah,

2367
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:22,480
but you heard what went down,

2368
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:22,721
you know,

2369
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:23,740
and he agreed with it.

2370
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,950
And then I decided to
direct part of the special,

2371
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,930
it's not the special the movie.

2372
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,250
And um,

2373
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,460
cause I come to the set one
day and it's like 110 degrees.

2374
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,661
And this guy,

2375
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:34,961
you know,

2376
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,670
the guy directing it was,

2377
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:36,971
you know,

2378
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,230
he had a funny character.

2379
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:43,231
He was very low keyed with a sombrero
cause it was Mexico and it was always hot.

2380
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:44,891
And I go,

2381
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:45,250
uh,

2382
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,330
what are we doing today?

2383
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:47,164
And he goes,

2384
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,000
I don't know.

2385
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:49,990
You know,

2386
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,823
and I go,

2387
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,660
do you want me to set the shot up?

2388
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,130
And he goes,

2389
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,030
would you please,

2390
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,130
this is the director now.

2391
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:58,180
He goes,

2392
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,013
just tapped out.

2393
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,560
He goes,

2394
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,050
I just want to finish
the movie and go home.

2395
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,520
And that's how he would talk.

2396
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:04,930
That's like an impression of the guy.

2397
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,090
So now I'm directing,

2398
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,990
I'm directing the movie and
that was a scene I directed.

2399
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:15,790
This was great because I was like a
little at war with frank still at the time

2400
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:16,624
on the set.

2401
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:22,140
So I was shooting a scene that I needed
Don Barris for and now I decided to club

2402
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:22,671
soda.

2403
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:24,080
Kenny will be in the movie also,

2404
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:25,431
you know.

2405
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:30,431
So frank is shooting a scene where he's
like playing a guitar in his underwear,

2406
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:34,640
talking to some girl he was
with in bed the night before.

2407
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,910
So I come in there and
I take the sound guys,

2408
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:38,540
I'm like,

2409
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,373
come on,

2410
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,460
just come with me.

2411
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,950
So now I got the sound guy.

2412
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:46,730
So he winds up shooting the soul scene
that he's doing and he doesn't know,

2413
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:47,930
he doesn't have sound.

2414
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,390
And all of a sudden
coming from this house,

2415
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:51,740
you hear him screaming,

2416
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:55,010
he tucked the fucking sound guys,

2417
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,420
you made me do all these takes and
we don't even have fucking sound.

2418
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,910
And then the director's going,

2419
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:04,400
well dices directing a scene right now,

2420
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:05,720
you know?

2421
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,171
And he goes,

2422
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:08,930
why the fuck is he directing anything?

2423
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,030
It's not his movie to direct.

2424
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:11,571
I mean,

2425
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:12,261
people were having,

2426
01:00:12,261 --> 01:00:14,300
and then we crashed the golf carts,

2427
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:15,860
which I got in trouble for.

2428
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:17,770
I played chicken with the,

2429
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:17,990
you know,

2430
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,741
Peta Dobson,

2431
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:19,460
he's an actor.

2432
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,090
No.

2433
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:20,690
Um,

2434
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,610
he's been in a lot of stuff anyway,

2435
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:24,470
so it's me and Dobson,

2436
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:27,680
we're good friends and decide to
play chicken with the golf carts.

2437
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:33,310
And I turned at the last second and my
golf cock gets completely destroyed and

2438
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:36,800
frank goes flying out of it
because he's with me going,

2439
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:37,880
what are you doing as what?

2440
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:41,240
Going towards each other and I'm
going to just stick with me on this.

2441
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:41,481
He goes,

2442
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:42,590
I don't want to stick with you.

2443
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:43,700
Stopped driving,

2444
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:44,391
you know,

2445
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,920
but we wouldn't stop driving.

2446
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,420
And I turned and they smash him.

2447
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:47,800
I,

2448
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,790
so now I'm not allowed
to be in the golf cart.

2449
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,241
Chicken.

2450
01:00:50,241 --> 01:00:50,510
Yeah.

2451
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,190
Chicken to see who turns first,

2452
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:53,630
you know,

2453
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,450
and then we're having sword
fights with the golf clubs.

2454
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:56,691
I mean,

2455
01:00:56,691 --> 01:00:58,700
it was ridiculous what was going on.

2456
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,301
You know,

2457
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:01,490
Beverly Deangelo's in the movie,

2458
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,121
uh,

2459
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:05,570
frank pressures in the Moodle
is your war with Frank Stallone?

2460
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:06,404
What was that?

2461
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,550
I believe the movie should be a comic,

2462
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:09,441
you know,

2463
01:01:09,441 --> 01:01:14,441
so I started doing like an impression
of him on screen cause I could do him

2464
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:17,810
really well the way he
stands and you know,

2465
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:19,700
so now he sees the final kind and he goes,

2466
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,890
what are you doing behind me?

2467
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,233
You know,

2468
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,590
I go an impression of you.

2469
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,491
He goes,

2470
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:27,560
you're not supposed to be
doing an impression of me.

2471
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:27,760
I'm,

2472
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,300
I'm the leader of the gang.

2473
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,130
But it's funny.

2474
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:33,020
And he goes to put the movies not funny,

2475
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:33,890
you know?

2476
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:37,010
And of course we all made
up if you know movie,

2477
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:37,670
you know,

2478
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,540
never came out,

2479
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:39,820
you know,

2480
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,450
make up with everybody
you make up with Paul.

2481
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,470
You made up a dark guy.

2482
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:42,681
Yeah.

2483
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:44,840
Because it's more fun
to have your friends.

2484
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,370
Are you going to make
up and laugh about it?

2485
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,380
You and dom Irrera ever going to make up,

2486
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,160
you know,

2487
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,180
it's not that I'm even like
mad at a guy like I rare.

2488
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:52,490
Right.

2489
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:52,881
You know,

2490
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:54,200
he's just stupid.

2491
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:55,603
You know what I mean?

2492
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,691
You know,

2493
01:01:56,691 --> 01:01:57,291
I really don't.

2494
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,430
I like both of you.

2495
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,170
I wish you guys would,

2496
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:00,440
uh,

2497
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,280
work that out.

2498
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,200
What does nothing to work out,

2499
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,060
you know,

2500
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:04,930
just call them stupid.

2501
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:05,900
I'd say you have an issue.

2502
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:06,680
Well,

2503
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,090
calling somebody stupid in saying,

2504
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,740
I don't like the guy at
two different things.

2505
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:11,601
Here we go.

2506
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:12,560
He's a great comic.

2507
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:14,090
I think he's a great comedian,

2508
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:14,901
but you know,

2509
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:15,150
he's,

2510
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,640
he's just too bitter for me.

2511
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,570
You know what I mean?

2512
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,071
You know,

2513
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:18,560
he,

2514
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,171
when you and him,

2515
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:20,100
I've always had like

2516
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,550
this,

2517
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,630
it's agonizing.

2518
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,030
Always had it with you used to,

2519
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,461
you know,

2520
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:27,010
I came in to Philly
years ago and you know,

2521
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,920
I would headline the
comedy factory outlet,

2522
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:30,641
you know,

2523
01:02:30,641 --> 01:02:32,710
so they would have him open the shows,

2524
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:33,731
you know,

2525
01:02:33,731 --> 01:02:37,570
and he would look at my character like
Italian rather than just a Brooklyn guy.

2526
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,070
And you know,

2527
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:39,311
you know,

2528
01:02:39,311 --> 01:02:41,200
my real name's Andrew Clay Silverstein.

2529
01:02:41,201 --> 01:02:42,970
And I went to Andrew dice clay,

2530
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,871
you know,

2531
01:02:43,871 --> 01:02:44,710
so when like,

2532
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:45,010
you know,

2533
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,690
we won the same Rodney special,

2534
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:47,711
you know,

2535
01:02:47,711 --> 01:02:48,401
and he,

2536
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:48,760
you know,

2537
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,840
he just got fucking jealous that my
career went through the roof and,

2538
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:53,171
you know,

2539
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:54,004
and he didn't,

2540
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:54,911
you know.

2541
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:57,340
And the funny thing about that was,

2542
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,690
I might've even talked about this on your
show that he would've been the perfect

2543
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:02,524
guy.

2544
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:02,831
You know,

2545
01:03:02,831 --> 01:03:04,270
when I was doing the arenas,

2546
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:04,901
you know,

2547
01:03:04,901 --> 01:03:06,220
to open those shows,

2548
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:06,701
you know,

2549
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:07,630
cause people did like,

2550
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:08,381
I'm on this special,

2551
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:09,041
but like I said,

2552
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:10,880
not everybody becomes a mega star.

2553
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,040
It just doesn't happen.

2554
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:13,990
Not everybody becomes the fucking Beatles.

2555
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:14,824
I'm sorry.

2556
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,491
You know?

2557
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:16,750
But he's a great comic.

2558
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:17,980
And because he had,

2559
01:03:17,981 --> 01:03:18,221
you know,

2560
01:03:18,221 --> 01:03:21,940
he started going on radio shows
and say in my real last name.

2561
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:22,630
And I'm like,

2562
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:23,351
what's the problem?

2563
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:23,521
A,

2564
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:27,730
a Jew from Brooklyn can't be a tough good
looking guys that the fucking problem,

2565
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:28,511
you know,

2566
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,610
unless I'm Italian.

2567
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:30,240
Well,

2568
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,480
well the,

2569
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,890
the name clay,

2570
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:33,550
where'd that come?

2571
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:33,641
Well,

2572
01:03:33,641 --> 01:03:34,690
that's just my middle name.

2573
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:35,770
Andrew Clay Silverstein.

2574
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:36,490
Oh,

2575
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,540
well my parents got it.

2576
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,531
So,

2577
01:03:38,531 --> 01:03:38,861
uh,

2578
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:41,410
when you decided to just go as dice clay,

2579
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:42,700
why did you decide to do that?

2580
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,870
Andrew dice clay?

2581
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:44,913
Yeah.

2582
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:47,420
Why'd you seem was mean?

2583
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:47,890
I mean,

2584
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,980
you know what the original
name was when I go on stage is,

2585
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:51,520
um,

2586
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,500
this was funny because when I,

2587
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,801
you know,

2588
01:03:53,801 --> 01:03:55,720
my original act was like impressions.

2589
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:56,860
I'll just put it to you that way.

2590
01:03:56,861 --> 01:03:57,131
You know,

2591
01:03:57,131 --> 01:04:01,390
doing Travolta and Stallone and
Jerry Lewis Travolta isn't Sam,

2592
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,640
you're Travolta is the
best or vault on earth?

2593
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:04,420
No one,

2594
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,440
no one nails it.

2595
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:06,551
Well,

2596
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,680
the thing about Travolta is that,

2597
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:09,520
you know,

2598
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,770
he had those Brooklyn characters and it,

2599
01:04:11,771 --> 01:04:12,041
you know,

2600
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,800
we were similar looking
when I was 17 years old,

2601
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:15,634
you know,

2602
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:16,990
and I was just able to do them,

2603
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:17,261
you know,

2604
01:04:17,261 --> 01:04:17,620
I was,

2605
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,780
I could turn it to Vinnie,

2606
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:19,450
Bob Marino,

2607
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,130
like,

2608
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:20,411
all right,

2609
01:04:20,411 --> 01:04:21,244
so you asked me,

2610
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,080
uh,

2611
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,501
Vinnie,

2612
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:22,811
you know,

2613
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:23,830
where's your homework?

2614
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:24,251
Vinnie?

2615
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:25,084
Where's your homework?

2616
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:26,743
What?

2617
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,990
That was the act.

2618
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:29,900
That was the whole thing.

2619
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,070
No,

2620
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:30,320
no,

2621
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,153
no

2622
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:32,870
words.

2623
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:33,220
You know,

2624
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,490
I did my homework book,

2625
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,800
but my dog ate it.

2626
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:38,530
I couldn't believe it.

2627
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,251
You know,

2628
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:40,650
and I would do all these Travolta it,

2629
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,010
but after the impressions,

2630
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:43,690
when I came to the comedy store,

2631
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:44,801
after I did,

2632
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:49,540
I got a shot on Don [inaudible] rock
concert and I did that whole act,

2633
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,330
but now it was about the acting
thing and I was thinking,

2634
01:04:52,331 --> 01:04:52,451
well,

2635
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:55,120
nobody's going to buy me
to do Travolta wrist alone.

2636
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,790
I got to develop my own stage persona.

2637
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:02,820
Do you know what kind of nuclear
arsenal of a joke you have in your,

2638
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:04,810
in,

2639
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,160
in your wheel house,

2640
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:10,930
if you just did it with you doing an
impression of Travolta and have some

2641
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:11,920
massage bit.

2642
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,610
Do you know with that impression
how good that bit would be?

2643
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,640
I know you don't want to do it and
ad luck at of a courtesy to Travolta.

2644
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:21,990
I know you think he's very talented.

2645
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:23,250
You don't do jokes about him,

2646
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,660
but my God,

2647
01:05:24,661 --> 01:05:27,810
what a fucking crushing
bit you would have.

2648
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:28,031
Yeah.

2649
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:28,550
But I,

2650
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:32,910
I know what compression is really good.

2651
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:34,100
And then with the,

2652
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:36,120
the situation is so ridiculous.

2653
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,430
Him just wanting to get
jerked off by all these guys,

2654
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,121
him saying,

2655
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:40,310
let me massage you.

2656
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:40,711
You're like,

2657
01:05:40,711 --> 01:05:40,861
it's,

2658
01:05:40,861 --> 01:05:42,150
the whole thing is great.

2659
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:42,750
I mean,

2660
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,160
it's right for comedy.

2661
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,330
I'm not hating the guy.

2662
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:45,950
I love him.

2663
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:46,070
Well,

2664
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:47,310
did you let him in the dig month?

2665
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:48,260
Thumbs into your neck?

2666
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,103
A little

2667
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:51,151
good.

2668
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:52,470
See you got a little crick,

2669
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:53,371
but I,

2670
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:54,280
you know what don't,

2671
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,680
why are you telling me?

2672
01:05:55,950 --> 01:06:00,400
You telling me that you pretending
to massage a guy and then stolen,

2673
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:03,790
then sliced says lowered.

2674
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:04,930
That feels pretty good.

2675
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,581
No,

2676
01:06:07,581 --> 01:06:08,750
I got a sense of humor about it.

2677
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:10,280
I just feel he's been through a lot.

2678
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,190
He's been through love,

2679
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,580
but he's also dished out a lot.

2680
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,420
He's one of our greatest stars,

2681
01:06:14,421 --> 01:06:15,320
so I can't do it.

2682
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:15,720
He's,

2683
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,670
that's hilarious.

2684
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:17,540
He's a great actor,

2685
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:18,321
no doubt about it.

2686
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:21,020
But he's also a freak life
getting jerked up by dude's.

2687
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:22,340
There's no question about that either.

2688
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,610
That seems to be a reoccurring
theme and I ain't hating the guy,

2689
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:25,881
man.

2690
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,370
You should be able to do
whatever the fuck you want to do.

2691
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,140
You know what it is?

2692
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,750
There's a lot of guys who
were blown just cause he's,

2693
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:31,210
but that's what the,

2694
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:31,670
you know,

2695
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:36,290
the problem with women were maybe that's
why he went to the guys I think just

2696
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:37,640
don't know how to jerk.

2697
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:38,630
I think he's a freak,

2698
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,590
you know what I mean?

2699
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:40,190
Is that it?

2700
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:41,660
You try to teach them,

2701
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,460
you know what I mean?

2702
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,640
Some girls just seem to have uh,

2703
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:45,590
uh,

2704
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,230
born in ability to do it correctly,

2705
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:49,580
so girls just get it.

2706
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,090
Yeah.

2707
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:50,660
You know,

2708
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,620
squeeze hard.

2709
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,910
Alright folks telling me to say here.

2710
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,460
Your thing is my wife is squeeze harder.

2711
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,550
Going to hey,

2712
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:01,110
send us.

2713
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:05,090
I got the legs wrapped behind
every years saddled down.

2714
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:05,280
Yeah.

2715
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,000
Look at him Mr. Date and not
by the hair of Chinny Chin.

2716
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,080
Chin can get a date,

2717
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:10,551
you know,

2718
01:07:10,551 --> 01:07:11,240
but no,

2719
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,310
I love Travolta.

2720
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,153
I let you know,

2721
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,800
I can only do impressions of,

2722
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:15,231
of,

2723
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,240
of the people in film that I really love.

2724
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,990
Right.

2725
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,160
It's too bad he can't do it.

2726
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:19,410
Well,

2727
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,480
I just didn't see it though.

2728
01:07:20,481 --> 01:07:21,650
I gave you a little less time.

2729
01:07:21,651 --> 01:07:22,370
I want to do it.

2730
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,200
That's it.

2731
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:23,420
Yeah.

2732
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:23,720
I mean,

2733
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,560
I could come up with it,

2734
01:07:24,561 --> 01:07:25,111
trust me,

2735
01:07:25,111 --> 01:07:26,990
but I got to leave the guy alone.

2736
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:28,670
That's a beautiful thing.

2737
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:30,050
I would not leave him alone.

2738
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:30,950
Even if we were tight.

2739
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,060
Can we do Travolta?

2740
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:32,480
No,

2741
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:32,720
no.

2742
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,860
You do any impressions?

2743
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,180
I can do a couple.

2744
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,160
I want to see one of your shows now.

2745
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,023
I'm not even kidding.

2746
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:39,130
I'll,

2747
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,310
I'll send you my special.

2748
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:41,660
I'll gift it to you.

2749
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,920
I'll give the five bucks.

2750
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:43,754
I'm willing to pay.

2751
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,193
You know what I mean?

2752
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:46,530
You know,

2753
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:47,363
just,

2754
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:47,750
you know,

2755
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,950
I got a heart for people.

2756
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:49,784
That's what it is.

2757
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,660
I understand.

2758
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:50,871
You know?

2759
01:07:50,871 --> 01:07:52,070
So even like when I rare,

2760
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:52,161
rare,

2761
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:53,000
like you were saying,

2762
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:53,834
you know what I mean?

2763
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,360
I don't know.

2764
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:54,571
I don't,

2765
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:55,250
I don't,

2766
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,390
I don't hate the guy.

2767
01:07:56,391 --> 01:07:56,661
You know,

2768
01:07:56,661 --> 01:07:56,910
they're,

2769
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,850
they're all guys I don't like,

2770
01:07:59,330 --> 01:07:59,991
you know what I mean?

2771
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:00,260
Yeah.

2772
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:00,561
I mean,

2773
01:08:00,561 --> 01:08:02,540
just don't like for many reasons.

2774
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,553
Right.

2775
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,680
His own,

2776
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:04,970
you know,

2777
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:06,710
jealousy would overcome him I guess,

2778
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:10,040
but he missed out on the
greatest Gig in the world,

2779
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:10,731
you know,

2780
01:08:10,731 --> 01:08:14,120
doing these arenas because
he is an Italian from Philly.

2781
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:14,391
I mean,

2782
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:16,310
I did the three times,

2783
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,331
you know what I mean?

2784
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:18,830
And he would have been
great in those rooms.

2785
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:22,520
So I would book Lenny Clarke
and Lenny Clarke wound up,

2786
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,301
I'll never forget,

2787
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:26,810
I did the universal amphitheater
and then he calls me up and he goes,

2788
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:27,381
you know,

2789
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:29,630
can I have some people come to the show?

2790
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:30,531
And I'm going,

2791
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:31,310
Leonie,

2792
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,630
that's what it's all about.

2793
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,130
Like why wouldn't you be able to have
people come to the show at 6,000 people,

2794
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:37,401
you know?

2795
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:37,940
Right.

2796
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,990
And he winds up,

2797
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,190
I don't know if you know
Lenny clocks all great,

2798
01:08:41,191 --> 01:08:41,660
but he,

2799
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,860
they gave him a sitcom.

2800
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:46,060
He got to sit down that night
and that didn't work out.

2801
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:48,020
And he wound up on the Sitcom with,

2802
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:48,854
uh,

2803
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,150
what was it,

2804
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,020
a Frazier,

2805
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:52,761
you know,

2806
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:53,361
Frazier,

2807
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:54,194
I think.

2808
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:55,270
Yeah.

2809
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,840
Where he played a cop now,

2810
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,630
wasn't that he wasn't on
the channel layer catch up,

2811
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,400
but didn't put it might've been that.

2812
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:01,220
Well,

2813
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,990
you could look red pen to something.

2814
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,700
You're running the panel.

2815
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,950
Do the IMD for Lenny Clarke,

2816
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:07,341
by the way.

2817
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:08,000
Larry Clark.

2818
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,121
No,

2819
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:10,240
but Lenny Clarke wound
up with a huge Korea.

2820
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,160
One of the funniest guy
and it was nice to know,

2821
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:13,761
but I'm telling you,

2822
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:16,610
it was that night that it
all came together for him.

2823
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,980
Lenny Clarke gave me some
great fucking advice too.

2824
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:22,220
Like my second time ever
getting paid to perform.

2825
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,430
I opened up for Lenny,

2826
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:26,330
this guy that I was working for,

2827
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:27,300
norm norm,

2828
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,340
the who was booking gigs in western
Massachusetts or these little one night

2829
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:32,174
bars.

2830
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:32,611
Yeah,

2831
01:09:32,611 --> 01:09:34,760
there's a place called js and Pittsfield,

2832
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:37,040
Massachusetts and I got
to open up for lending.

2833
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:40,760
This is after Lenny had been on
HBO and I got to go and my car,

2834
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,050
it was a funny moment because,

2835
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:42,560
uh,

2836
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,560
his brother has a great guy but still
books a club called giggles and saw Mike

2837
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:48,741
Clark is the shit.

2838
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:49,520
He's just a great,

2839
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,360
great fucking guy.

2840
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,081
I never met him,

2841
01:09:51,081 --> 01:09:51,861
but I know he's a Greg.

2842
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:52,581
He gives me advice.

2843
01:09:52,581 --> 01:09:53,391
It's reputation.

2844
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:53,961
He's like power.

2845
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:54,830
You're pretty funny,

2846
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:56,780
but you're going to have to
clean it up a little bit.

2847
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,030
Talking to the right ones.

2848
01:09:59,031 --> 01:09:59,241
Dad,

2849
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:00,170
Madonna bit,

2850
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:00,561
you know,

2851
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:01,970
that one is just too much.

2852
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:02,061
I,

2853
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:02,540
you know,

2854
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,250
it was just saying like for his rooms,

2855
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:04,491
you know,

2856
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:05,780
like where I would work.

2857
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,250
But then when he comes off stage

2858
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,460
kid that was fucking hilarious.

2859
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:10,840
Holy Shit.

2860
01:10:10,841 --> 01:10:13,180
That fucking Madonna bid was fucking hot.

2861
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,610
Is

2862
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,480
that heavy Boston accent and Mike's like,

2863
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,290
I just got told done telling
them to stop doing that bit

2864
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,530
there cat cat show.

2865
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,450
It wasn't John Lennon here
and she also did Lenny.

2866
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:25,284
I Lenny up lending,

2867
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:28,000
I should know that because it was next
door to us when we were filming news

2868
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:28,351
radio.

2869
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,891
He was over there.

2870
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:29,610
He fucking,

2871
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:32,010
he said that John Lara QED guy was a Twat.

2872
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,760
He would just say how fucking
horrendous it was to work with that guy.

2873
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,110
Yeah.

2874
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:36,943
But he took great.

2875
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:37,973
Yeah.

2876
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:38,843
Lenny was,

2877
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:43,290
Lenny was a top notch stand up like before
he was buddies are all the guys that

2878
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:44,360
were on the Rodney special.

2879
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,800
So you had Lenny clock,

2880
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,090
you had uh,

2881
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:48,421
you know,

2882
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:49,390
they had to fill a spot.

2883
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:53,500
So he put Barry Sobel and now I saw,

2884
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,300
look Barry syllabub one point in
time was pretty fucking funny.

2885
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:57,601
See,

2886
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:58,660
it was pretty fucking funny.

2887
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,820
He's a funny guy,

2888
01:10:59,821 --> 01:11:00,654
but you know,

2889
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,460
when we did the Rodney special,

2890
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:04,380
you know how he was baseball jacket.

2891
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,710
So he shows up with a motorcycle jacket.

2892
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:08,520
All right?

2893
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:11,430
A blacklight and he's going
on like a two before me.

2894
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:12,870
It was Lenny than

2895
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,210
then Carol Lee for them,

2896
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:16,044
myself.

2897
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,180
Then Bill Hicks,

2898
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,260
uh,

2899
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,360
IRA and Bob Schimmel.

2900
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,220
And so he comes in wearing a
motorcycle jacket and he goes,

2901
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:27,720
this is what I'm wearing
on the show tonight.

2902
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:28,960
So I'm like,

2903
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:29,500
all right,

2904
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,510
another jerk off.

2905
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:31,380
Cause I didn't know him well,

2906
01:11:31,381 --> 01:11:32,190
you know,

2907
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,150
and I go over to Rodney,

2908
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:34,860
I go look with the guys wearing Rodney.

2909
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:36,203
And Rodney goes,

2910
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:36,421
yeah,

2911
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:36,990
so what,

2912
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:37,350
you know,

2913
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,621
I go,

2914
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:37,741
well,

2915
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:39,030
he wants to wear it on the show.

2916
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,230
And then Rodney caught it.

2917
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,123
You know,

2918
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:41,690
he's gone,

2919
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:42,120
Barry,

2920
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,601
come in,

2921
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:43,230
man.

2922
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,063
You know what I mean?

2923
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,241
He goes,

2924
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:46,590
what are you going to wait on the show?

2925
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,610
And I'm standing right there.

2926
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:47,851
He goes,

2927
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:47,940
well,

2928
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,020
I'm going to wear this jacket.

2929
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,113
And Rodney goes,

2930
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,390
if you hit a jacket,

2931
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:51,631
man,

2932
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:52,620
you're not on the show.

2933
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:53,281
Okay,

2934
01:11:53,281 --> 01:11:53,731
dice,

2935
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:54,600
where's the leather?

2936
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,561
You know?

2937
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,580
And of course Barry took out his little
baseball jacket and that was the end of

2938
01:11:59,581 --> 01:11:59,970
that.

2939
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,980
Do you think he was trying
to do it until like,

2940
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,073
you know what,

2941
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:04,980
you know when I prepared,

2942
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:05,250
you know,

2943
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,050
just like I'm talking
about my special now,

2944
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:07,320
right.

2945
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,400
I'm really prepared,

2946
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:09,241
you know,

2947
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:13,470
I'm not going to do a half ass job
when I'm up there and when that Rodney

2948
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:14,190
special,

2949
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,023
you know about,

2950
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,620
I had about six months to get ready for
that and every night I'd go on at the

2951
01:12:19,621 --> 01:12:20,221
comedy store.

2952
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:23,010
I wouldn't care if it was too
fucking people in the crowd.

2953
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:24,443
I'm rehearsing,

2954
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:25,950
I'm rehearsing the act.

2955
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:26,550
That's it.

2956
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,290
Joke to joke to joke,

2957
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,940
you know Halloween,

2958
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:30,571
there's dom,

2959
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,810
I rare but just fucking
around on stage and I'm like,

2960
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,700
these guys just don't get it.

2961
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:40,410
Because I knew when I would be in front
of that camera that the only thing I

2962
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:44,760
needed to worry about was playing
the people and the people at home.

2963
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,440
I didn't want to think about the act.

2964
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:51,270
I want them to be on automatic
pilot because your nerves
get to you and you want

2965
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:52,320
to do the performance.

2966
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:53,154
Now,

2967
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:56,130
and these guys would just
fuck around at the store.

2968
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:57,240
They wouldn't rehearse it,

2969
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:57,901
you know?

2970
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:00,840
And then they show up to do the
special and everybody's nervous.

2971
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,250
And I'll never forget,

2972
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:04,140
I walked from the Regency Hotel,

2973
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:04,951
you know,

2974
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:08,550
I just want it to feel New York and I
was in my outfit for the Rod and I'm

2975
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:09,840
wearing a belt buckle,

2976
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,060
you know this fucking big,

2977
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,300
you know the song.

2978
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,910
And I come walking into the club,

2979
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:17,850
I got the glasses on and Rodney goes,

2980
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:18,320
had he,

2981
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:18,710
he,

2982
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:19,410
he's like,

2983
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:20,730
how do you feel man?

2984
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:21,090
You know,

2985
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:21,430
Rodney,

2986
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,020
right?

2987
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,280
And I go tonight,

2988
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:24,114
they pay,

2989
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,100
they pay tonight.

2990
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,090
They get disciplined.

2991
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,160
And Rodney tonight,

2992
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:29,580
Dave,

2993
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:29,940
hey,

2994
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,230
okay man,

2995
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:32,064
you're ready

2996
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,170
tonight.

2997
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,340
They're going to get disciplined.

2998
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:36,180
Did you hear that?

2999
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,640
And he just got such a kick out of it,

3000
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:39,390
you know?

3001
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:40,440
And when I went on,

3002
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:41,190
it was like,

3003
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:44,700
just kill them first show out of the box.

3004
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:45,481
I loved it.

3005
01:13:45,481 --> 01:13:46,520
Or I need did that,

3006
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:50,400
that Rodney had those specials and
introduce so many fucking comedian.

3007
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:50,510
Well,

3008
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:50,970
you know what,

3009
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:51,480
that's,

3010
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,810
if I do more as far as comedy specials,

3011
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:55,650
that's what I want to do.

3012
01:13:55,651 --> 01:13:57,600
Now I want to put guys on that.

3013
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,430
I think a great go around the country,

3014
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:03,000
find the best know that's a great
and deliver those guys to America.

3015
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:04,020
That's a great idea.

3016
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:04,470
You know,

3017
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,861
and you know,

3018
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:05,820
I spoke to showtime,

3019
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,541
they were into it.

3020
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:06,890
You know,

3021
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:07,290
it's,

3022
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:08,670
but first I gotta do this,

3023
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:09,481
you know,

3024
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:13,270
and really I think people are just
to be fucking thrilled with this.

3025
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,021
You know,

3026
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:15,760
I was thrilled with the end result.

3027
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,890
La Rocs just rocks the room,

3028
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:22,060
which was a little scary to me
because when I saw the audience,

3029
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:22,983
you know,

3030
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,670
you know my boy just like,

3031
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,190
like comics now that you got,

3032
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,240
I think we used 18 cameras,

3033
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:28,960
you know,

3034
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,793
for the shoot.

3035
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,813
So you know,

3036
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,440
you know what I'm talking about.

3037
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,550
Just the pressure of,

3038
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:34,160
you know,

3039
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,560
deuce a director,

3040
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,140
all the people involved in the special.

3041
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:39,131
And you know,

3042
01:14:39,131 --> 01:14:40,390
my kids came out,

3043
01:14:40,391 --> 01:14:40,690
you know,

3044
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:45,670
Eleanor introduced them and they just
rocked the room and the crowd went nuts

3045
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,700
because I'm worried that they're
not going to let them get started.

3046
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:49,870
You know what I mean?

3047
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:51,280
And they just rock that.

3048
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:52,480
I'm so proud of them.

3049
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:55,300
And they're actually going to be
at the whiskey on January 12th.

3050
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:56,980
So people that want to see a,

3051
01:14:56,981 --> 01:15:01,981
a great band that's breaking La Rocs
could go to the whiskey on the 12th of

3052
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,030
January.

3053
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:07,840
It's always hard to get yourself into
a normal performance mode when you're

3054
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:08,674
doing a special,

3055
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,011
you know,

3056
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:09,371
it's like,

3057
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:10,450
it's when all the,

3058
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,250
everything's riding on this one night,

3059
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:13,810
you've got two shows to get it right.

3060
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:18,010
Like sometimes the pressure
can be overwhelming and
you want to know something.

3061
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,540
I only wanted to do one.

3062
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:20,830
Uh,

3063
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,670
and you know,

3064
01:15:21,671 --> 01:15:23,890
it was the people at showtime
that was smart enough to go,

3065
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:24,131
no,

3066
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:25,120
you're doing too.

3067
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,313
You know,

3068
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:29,290
and they were right because I fucked
up a few times in the first one.

3069
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,951
Yeah.

3070
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:30,151
It's,

3071
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:31,380
it's always hard to just,

3072
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,560
I wasn't nervous.

3073
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:32,920
I was,

3074
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,600
I was excited about it though.

3075
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,021
You know,

3076
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:36,460
it's the nervous excitement,

3077
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:36,731
you know,

3078
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:39,370
and then you get that first
laugh and you just loosen up.

3079
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:39,790
Yeah.

3080
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:41,680
But I was just so prepared.

3081
01:15:41,681 --> 01:15:41,921
I mean,

3082
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:42,431
like you said,

3083
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:43,264
you came to,

3084
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,133
uh,

3085
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:44,710
you know,

3086
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:45,070
uh,

3087
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:48,100
Vegas and saw the show
and saw me working on it.

3088
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,330
And you know,

3089
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:52,720
Vegas crowds aren't as great
as crowds around the country,

3090
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:53,590
you know?

3091
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,910
And that's another thing I like.

3092
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:56,740
So it felt like the comedy store,

3093
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:57,390
you know,

3094
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,950
because in Vegas there's a
lot of variables going on.

3095
01:15:59,951 --> 01:16:00,731
This gambling,

3096
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:01,564
drinking,

3097
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,190
fighting with the check over,

3098
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,540
losing the fucking money.

3099
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:06,220
Now you were to show 10 at night,

3100
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:06,881
you know,

3101
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:08,770
and you're not even in
the mood for that show.

3102
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:09,250
Yeah.

3103
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:09,521
You know,

3104
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:10,980
so the crowd,

3105
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:14,410
you'd never get that full amped
up crowd that you would get.

3106
01:16:14,411 --> 01:16:16,660
Like when you're on the
road doing a concert,

3107
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,420
you know that they're just
coming for the concert.

3108
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:22,210
So when I got to Chicago and you know,

3109
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:25,180
I hear the crowd before you even
come on that doing the dice,

3110
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:25,781
dice,

3111
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:26,490
dice,

3112
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:26,950
I'm gone.

3113
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:27,340
All right,

3114
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,810
this is the real deal now.

3115
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,441
So yeah,

3116
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:33,220
I fucked up a couple of times in
the first taping of it and you know,

3117
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,330
and then I got angry.

3118
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,070
It became dice mean,

3119
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:36,791
you know,

3120
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,020
for the second show.

3121
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:38,710
And it just,

3122
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,870
I just delivered the way I knew I can.

3123
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,950
One of the things that helped me,

3124
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:44,590
and this is I think would help you to uh,

3125
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,610
doing a podcast helps you
launch stage tremendously.

3126
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,830
You get so used to talking to people.

3127
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,220
You get so used to doing things
like live that when we do,

3128
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:55,001
when I did these,

3129
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:55,211
uh,

3130
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,440
the special in,

3131
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:56,750
uh,

3132
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,583
Atlanta,

3133
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:58,060
I,

3134
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:58,420
I,

3135
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:03,420
there was the most natural I'd ever felt
being on stage because the Tabernacle I

3136
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,500
had always had a problem with
that we're like going on.

3137
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:07,480
When I was taping something,

3138
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:09,890
I'd be like Steph and tight
and was just like never see.

3139
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:10,040
You

3140
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,530
were really happy with the
outcome of your performance.

3141
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:14,690
Forget it was 100%.

3142
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:16,100
How I always am a,

3143
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:18,590
it was 100% like you even
said it while I was on stage.

3144
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:18,831
I was like,

3145
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:20,930
this is the most relaxed
I've ever been doing.

3146
01:17:20,931 --> 01:17:23,810
One of these things cause I didn't
because she was so prepared,

3147
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:24,650
so prepared.

3148
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,380
I'd put a lot of lot
of sets in to prepare,

3149
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:29,000
a lot of writing in to prepare.

3150
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:29,660
I had,

3151
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:33,610
I had all the material like
completely down and but it was the,

3152
01:17:33,611 --> 01:17:33,831
this,

3153
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:36,230
the audience is so fucking enthusiastic.

3154
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,030
It's like that's what it ate.

3155
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:38,421
Yeah.

3156
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:40,220
They're so fun and like,

3157
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:40,851
like I said,

3158
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:44,310
that's where we do parallel because
we both draw crazy audiences.

3159
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:44,830
Yeah.

3160
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:47,900
You know people that are really
out for the hardcore comedy,

3161
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:48,981
you know what I mean?

3162
01:17:48,981 --> 01:17:50,630
So you really delivered it then.

3163
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:55,660
Well I am so happy that there's still
guys out there that are doing anything

3164
01:17:56,631 --> 01:18:00,770
controversial because I think this is
such a strange time when it comes to

3165
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:01,604
comedy.

3166
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,090
You know,

3167
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,610
there's been so many
from the tosh thing too,

3168
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:06,710
the Tracy Morgan thing too,

3169
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,430
you know,

3170
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,910
just fill in the blank of every,

3171
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:10,370
any comedian that says anything.

3172
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:11,750
The Gilbert Godfrey thing,

3173
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:13,280
when he got in trouble for a lot of shit,

3174
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,533
it's like at a,

3175
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:16,160
at a certain point in time,

3176
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:17,040
it's like we're going to,

3177
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:21,310
if you keep going down this super ultra
sensitive fucking stupid path yet,

3178
01:18:21,311 --> 01:18:22,290
then there'll be no fun,

3179
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,633
no comedy.

3180
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,680
And by the way,

3181
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,660
you're just saying what you don't like.

3182
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,081
Okay.

3183
01:18:27,081 --> 01:18:28,370
You're saying you don't like it.

3184
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:28,821
Well,

3185
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:29,930
fucking don't listen.

3186
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:31,010
It's really simple.

3187
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,400
If you're not into what a guy
like Tracy Morgan would say,

3188
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:35,240
or a guy like you would say,

3189
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,340
well then don't fucking listen.

3190
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:36,560
No,

3191
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,170
no one's read it.

3192
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,120
Hiring you to,

3193
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:40,370
you can't tell me that it's bad.

3194
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:41,750
You can't tell me that it's real.

3195
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,501
You know,

3196
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:43,340
it's a joke.

3197
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,870
He's a fucking commit.

3198
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:45,770
That shouldn't be,

3199
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,311
you know,

3200
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:47,061
it's like I said,

3201
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:48,770
these comics are being put on trial.

3202
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:49,330
Right.

3203
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:49,760
You know,

3204
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,660
and um,

3205
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,381
you know,

3206
01:18:51,381 --> 01:18:52,970
there's even a bit that,

3207
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:53,330
you know,

3208
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:55,370
I do where I use the fag word,

3209
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,473
but it's,

3210
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,550
and the last thing I did it,

3211
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,251
I did a,

3212
01:18:59,251 --> 01:19:02,490
an interview for a rolling
stone like three weeks ago.

3213
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,803
And,

3214
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:04,763
you know,

3215
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,070
the guy asked me why I used the word fag,

3216
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:08,971
you know,

3217
01:19:08,971 --> 01:19:09,421
and I said,

3218
01:19:09,421 --> 01:19:09,601
well,

3219
01:19:09,601 --> 01:19:11,130
did you listen to the whole?

3220
01:19:11,131 --> 01:19:11,410
And,

3221
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:12,960
and he listened to the whole show,

3222
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:14,010
he watched the whole show.

3223
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,230
And I said,

3224
01:19:16,231 --> 01:19:17,970
do you see where I go with the bit?

3225
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:20,160
What I'm really doing
by the end of that bit?

3226
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:24,530
Is it sticking up for the gay
community is what I'm doing it,

3227
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:25,770
it winds up about like,

3228
01:19:25,771 --> 01:19:26,041
you know,

3229
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:26,970
when the guys were running,

3230
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:27,301
you know,

3231
01:19:27,301 --> 01:19:28,380
try enough for president,

3232
01:19:28,381 --> 01:19:29,214
whatever.

3233
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,263
And um,

3234
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,100
so it's about the whole marriage thing.

3235
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:32,730
You know,

3236
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:33,001
I don't,

3237
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:34,280
I don't want to do the bid on the end,

3238
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:34,981
you know,

3239
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:37,470
but that's what the bits about I go.

3240
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:38,850
And if I would say,

3241
01:19:38,851 --> 01:19:39,151
you know,

3242
01:19:39,151 --> 01:19:41,460
catch gay rather than catch fag,

3243
01:19:41,461 --> 01:19:42,030
I go,

3244
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:43,380
fig is a funny word.

3245
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:44,603
You know what I mean?

3246
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,800
And for people that don't like it,

3247
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:48,120
well don't watch my shell,

3248
01:19:48,121 --> 01:19:51,060
but it's funny and
that's who I am on stage.

3249
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:53,010
But if you're going to
talk about anything,

3250
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:54,630
talk about what the bit really,

3251
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:55,201
you know,

3252
01:19:55,201 --> 01:19:56,160
turns into,

3253
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,081
you know,

3254
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:57,320
not,

3255
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,220
not a word.

3256
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:59,510
Have you ever done anything,

3257
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:02,330
any year old material that you
look back now and you're like,

3258
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:02,431
oh,

3259
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:03,470
I wouldn't do that today.

3260
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:04,304
I wouldn't say that.

3261
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,680
I really don't have many regrets on the,

3262
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,230
uh,

3263
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:08,471
you know,

3264
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,150
I don't use too much of it in a special,

3265
01:20:10,151 --> 01:20:11,710
I do a couple of classic bits.

3266
01:20:11,711 --> 01:20:12,850
That's what I call them.

3267
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:13,721
You know,

3268
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:14,800
like today on a,

3269
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:17,920
I was on good morning La and you know,

3270
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:21,010
they played like some of this
midget bit that I've done for years.

3271
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,770
But these are the new fans.

3272
01:20:22,771 --> 01:20:25,130
So you'd give them some of the
classic stuff you give them the,

3273
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,140
the mother goose.

3274
01:20:26,141 --> 01:20:27,130
But other than that,

3275
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:27,940
you know,

3276
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:28,570
you know,

3277
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,850
98% new act,

3278
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:31,571
you know,

3279
01:20:31,571 --> 01:20:32,530
I've updated,

3280
01:20:32,531 --> 01:20:32,771
you know,

3281
01:20:32,771 --> 01:20:34,630
how I feel about different things.

3282
01:20:34,631 --> 01:20:35,470
And you know,

3283
01:20:35,471 --> 01:20:35,951
like I said,

3284
01:20:35,951 --> 01:20:37,060
we're living in a different world.

3285
01:20:37,061 --> 01:20:37,781
Technology,

3286
01:20:37,781 --> 01:20:38,890
we're living in a world where,

3287
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:39,491
you know,

3288
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:41,440
women today a brought up on porn,

3289
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:42,310
you know,

3290
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,630
God forbid they don't have a,

3291
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:44,021
you know,

3292
01:20:44,021 --> 01:20:45,030
a profile shot.

3293
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:45,151
It,

3294
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:46,060
I bleached out ass,

3295
01:20:46,061 --> 01:20:48,580
hold on on the website or whatever.

3296
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,170
They feel that not happening,

3297
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:50,981
you know,

3298
01:20:50,981 --> 01:20:51,760
so,

3299
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,031
you know,

3300
01:20:52,031 --> 01:20:52,451
so,

3301
01:20:52,451 --> 01:20:53,650
so everything is new,

3302
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:54,630
but it's got that,

3303
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:54,931
you know,

3304
01:20:54,931 --> 01:20:59,740
real heavy bite to it and it's got the
anger that I like to bring to stage.

3305
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:00,401
I mean,

3306
01:21:00,401 --> 01:21:01,520
I couldn't do it like you.

3307
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,141
I mean when,

3308
01:21:02,141 --> 01:21:03,790
when I see you screaming up there,

3309
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,730
I had a couple of screaming
he is but not as intense.

3310
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,990
Like that's what,

3311
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:09,580
that's what would make me
sit down and watch you.

3312
01:21:09,581 --> 01:21:12,460
I wanted to see how long can he scream,

3313
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,830
how long can he put that energy out?

3314
01:21:14,831 --> 01:21:19,831
And you could back then you were gone
like two hours you could do and just like,

3315
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:20,560
oh,

3316
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,880
he loves it.

3317
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:22,631
You know,

3318
01:21:22,631 --> 01:21:23,620
it was almost like,

3319
01:21:23,621 --> 01:21:24,454
it was,

3320
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,920
it was more about,

3321
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:28,660
it was almost like you're
doing a verbal workout,

3322
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:29,943
you know what I mean?

3323
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:30,971
You know,

3324
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:31,781
it wasn't like,

3325
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:32,081
all right,

3326
01:21:32,081 --> 01:21:32,581
I do a,

3327
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:32,791
B,

3328
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:33,110
c,

3329
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:34,240
d and I'm done.

3330
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:37,090
You would just go and I'm going kind of,

3331
01:21:37,091 --> 01:21:39,320
and what is this guy taking to that?

3332
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:41,620
Anything like I'm watching you today,

3333
01:21:41,621 --> 01:21:42,011
you know,

3334
01:21:42,011 --> 01:21:42,790
um,

3335
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:43,031
you know,

3336
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:47,500
talk about like the different vitamins
and everything that it's on and I'm gone.

3337
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:50,720
He's taken something
that could really make a,

3338
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:54,580
I'm thinking maybe I should take some
of those fucking vitamins because you

3339
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:56,200
could really go for a long time.

3340
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,203
Yeah.

3341
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,113
Volume.

3342
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,550
It's not just about I'm taking vitamins.

3343
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:01,780
It's definitely about what you eat.

3344
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,250
It's really important.

3345
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:03,671
No,

3346
01:22:03,671 --> 01:22:04,810
but I mean the energy,

3347
01:22:04,811 --> 01:22:07,030
that's what I love because you know,

3348
01:22:07,031 --> 01:22:08,650
when somebody is putting
out that kind of energy,

3349
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:09,730
it's watchable.

3350
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,270
We didn't have,

3351
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:12,090
that's a good point that
you brought up earlier.

3352
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:12,691
We didn't,

3353
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:12,940
uh,

3354
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,110
touch back on with the,

3355
01:22:14,111 --> 01:22:14,290
uh,

3356
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:17,650
the idea that there's something wrong
with you if you're moving around or like

3357
01:22:17,651 --> 01:22:18,850
putting out a lot of effort.

3358
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,030
There was a time in comedy where guys
like Dan and respect anybody who didn't

3359
01:22:22,031 --> 01:22:26,260
just stand still and just say it with
your words and it's like what you will,

3360
01:22:26,261 --> 01:22:28,180
why would you lose like that performed?

3361
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:28,961
Like I would see a guy,

3362
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:30,940
like maybe Jim brewer is a good example,

3363
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,800
was really physical on stage.

3364
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:33,630
And,

3365
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,000
um,

3366
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,510
I would see like that the physical
aspects of him moving around.

3367
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:38,800
Was it really half?

3368
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,060
Yeah,

3369
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,160
half the belt and hilarious.

3370
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:46,180
And any comic that doesn't believe
that isn't a real performer.

3371
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:46,481
Yeah.

3372
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:48,010
And when it comes for that,

3373
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,930
when it calls for that rather
is nothing wrong with anybody.

3374
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:52,450
Just Pasal little,

3375
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:53,650
but it became a thing.

3376
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:56,620
Do you remember when it was like a
thing amongst comedians that if you,

3377
01:22:56,621 --> 01:22:56,830
you know,

3378
01:22:56,830 --> 01:23:00,610
they like didn't respect guys who like
put forth too much after when I came to

3379
01:23:00,611 --> 01:23:01,391
the comedy still,

3380
01:23:01,391 --> 01:23:02,950
because I had some,

3381
01:23:02,951 --> 01:23:03,191
you know,

3382
01:23:03,191 --> 01:23:04,660
at that time with the cassette tapes,

3383
01:23:04,661 --> 01:23:06,070
I have my on tapes

3384
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:10,090
Travolta and do it like I would
do to grease lightning number.

3385
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,970
I felt like I felt like the,

3386
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,960
the Serpico of the comedy
store because comics would go,

3387
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:17,231
you know,

3388
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:20,980
this is the music store and
not the comedies and this
is the comedy store and at

3389
01:23:20,981 --> 01:23:21,970
the music store.

3390
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:22,751
And I got,

3391
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,490
because you can't do that.

3392
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:25,780
How does that sound?

3393
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:26,711
You know,

3394
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:30,280
you just can't do that and you
don't look like this to do that.

3395
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,540
You're an ugly guy.

3396
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,591
You know what I mean?

3397
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,110
So you should be doing what you'd,

3398
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:34,361
oh,

3399
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:37,450
I had argument after argument with comics.

3400
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:37,691
I go,

3401
01:23:37,691 --> 01:23:37,811
well,

3402
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:40,000
you know what the club
on it thinks I am funny.

3403
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:40,421
Well,

3404
01:23:40,421 --> 01:23:40,930
there's always,

3405
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:44,440
there's a weird thing amongst comedians
when they want other comedians to be

3406
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:44,801
doing,

3407
01:23:44,801 --> 01:23:45,820
they're kind of comedy.

3408
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:46,631
It's ridiculous.

3409
01:23:46,631 --> 01:23:50,610
It's like a rapper going up to a guy
who plays jazz and get mad at him for

3410
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,150
liking the fucking flute.

3411
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:53,463
Yeah.

3412
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:55,003
But you know,

3413
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,500
I also feel what comics is,

3414
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,010
you know,

3415
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:57,590
not enough.

3416
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:58,251
I'm where we,

3417
01:23:58,251 --> 01:23:59,084
I've told you that.

3418
01:23:59,380 --> 01:23:59,930
I agree.

3419
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,221
Look,

3420
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:00,720
I agree.

3421
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,061
You know,

3422
01:24:01,061 --> 01:24:03,340
I just don't feel they
back each other up enough.

3423
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:04,240
That's why it's always good.

3424
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:05,770
Like when you came to my show,

3425
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:10,180
I was thrilled because he has another
comic that I respect coming to see me

3426
01:24:10,181 --> 01:24:11,014
perform.

3427
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:11,861
It's almost like,

3428
01:24:11,861 --> 01:24:12,490
you know,

3429
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,810
you know Sinatra going to see Sammy Davis,

3430
01:24:14,811 --> 01:24:15,221
so you know,

3431
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:16,990
like they back each other up with it.

3432
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:17,590
Yeah.

3433
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,090
It's very important to me.

3434
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:19,391
Uh,

3435
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:19,931
I think,

3436
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:20,160
uh,

3437
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:20,750
the,

3438
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,311
first of all,

3439
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:24,130
as I've gotten older and been
doing standup longer and longer,

3440
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:26,350
the more I've appreciated
the art form of it,

3441
01:24:26,351 --> 01:24:26,711
you know,

3442
01:24:26,711 --> 01:24:30,670
whether it's the style that you do
or the style that even Seinfeld,

3443
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:30,921
I'm,

3444
01:24:30,921 --> 01:24:31,570
I'm a,

3445
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:34,240
I'm a fan of any style of good.

3446
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:34,481
Like,

3447
01:24:34,481 --> 01:24:35,170
so I love that.

3448
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,630
I love Gaffigan Catholic
and it's fucking hilarious.

3449
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:41,080
Very clean and like
anybody can listen to it,

3450
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:41,351
you know,

3451
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:42,670
I love that style as wow.

3452
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:44,690
I just love the art form.

3453
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:45,341
So for me,

3454
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:47,020
comradery between other comics,

3455
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:47,850
like it's huge,

3456
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:48,341
huge,

3457
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:48,971
huge area.

3458
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:50,380
And put what I also like is,

3459
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,910
is this,

3460
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:56,911
I get a kick out of like the non comradery
of the clean comics to guys like us.

3461
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:58,030
Yeah.

3462
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:58,930
Like they look at us,

3463
01:24:58,931 --> 01:24:59,320
it's like,

3464
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,670
oh look who walked in,

3465
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,630
you know,

3466
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:02,940
with a clean guy.

3467
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:03,880
You know,

3468
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,310
and Seinfeld always had
his little group of guys,

3469
01:25:06,311 --> 01:25:08,170
which I think a hysterical him,

3470
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:09,100
Larry Miller,

3471
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:09,851
you know,

3472
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:11,740
pull rise a very clean,

3473
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:12,580
you know,

3474
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,281
to me the,

3475
01:25:13,281 --> 01:25:13,720
you know,

3476
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,050
the,

3477
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:16,540
the all similar in this styles on stage.

3478
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:16,901
Well,

3479
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:18,940
I think Seinfeld was legit.

3480
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:20,800
That was legitimately him,

3481
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,740
but there was a lot of guys that
came up that were like sort of what's

3482
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,660
legitimately him,

3483
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:29,770
but that that whole group had like a
certain stuff like intimidating Larry

3484
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:31,270
Miller just kill fluence though.

3485
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:35,470
What I'm saying is that there's a
lot of guys that became Seinfeld,

3486
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,440
like there was a lot of very Seinfeld,

3487
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:42,130
like observational guys that I don't know
if they would have been that way if it

3488
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:45,580
wasn't for Jerry because Jerry had a
very specific style that a lot of those

3489
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:50,581
clean guys imitated that style really
clearly and it's really no Seinfeld I

3490
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:51,581
love.

3491
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:54,640
I think he's just merely
just kit kills me.

3492
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,010
I love him on TV.

3493
01:25:57,011 --> 01:25:58,090
I mean acting.

3494
01:25:58,091 --> 01:25:59,900
I mean I think he's one
of the funniest guys ever.

3495
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,120
Did you ever see a stand up?

3496
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:01,871
Yeah,

3497
01:26:01,871 --> 01:26:02,680
I've seen his standup.

3498
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:02,921
Yeah,

3499
01:26:02,921 --> 01:26:03,890
I seen a long time.

3500
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:05,980
I saw some old old evening
at the Improv was very,

3501
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,890
very close to sound the
face and you know the way,

3502
01:26:09,891 --> 01:26:10,520
you know,

3503
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,740
he's always shocked by things like that.

3504
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:13,900
Very bright guy too.

3505
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,750
That's why I don't like
to hang out with him.

3506
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:17,091
He is,

3507
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:18,830
he's really smart and you don't like it?

3508
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:19,260
No,

3509
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:19,560
no,

3510
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,361
I love him.

3511
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:20,850
But you know,

3512
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:21,200
we've,

3513
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,510
we used to do like La Jolla
together and everything

3514
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:25,020
thing and you know,

3515
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,093
you know,

3516
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:28,920
there was a story where we
did a private party and uh,

3517
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:29,950
you know,

3518
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:30,511
you know,

3519
01:26:30,511 --> 01:26:31,344
and I,

3520
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,650
the guy offered me like
$1,000 to do a birthday party,

3521
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:35,641
you know,

3522
01:26:35,641 --> 01:26:37,640
in the hoyer and I,

3523
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:39,480
I go over to Larry and I said,

3524
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:40,650
we'll split the money you,

3525
01:26:40,651 --> 01:26:42,480
you opened for me at the birthday party,

3526
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:43,793
you know,

3527
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,400
and uh,

3528
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,080
what's this big mansion?

3529
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:50,690
And I think this is the guy that
invented a sex wax for a surfboard.

3530
01:26:50,691 --> 01:26:51,480
Surfboards.

3531
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:55,290
And so we show up and I see
a bunch of five year olds,

3532
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:56,311
you know,

3533
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,030
and I'm going,

3534
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:57,271
you know,

3535
01:26:57,271 --> 01:26:58,230
I called a guy and I'm like,

3536
01:26:58,231 --> 01:26:59,020
oh,

3537
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,540
you really going to have me do my act?

3538
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:01,801
And he goes,

3539
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:02,400
no,

3540
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,960
we got a clown for them.

3541
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,081
You'll for us.

3542
01:27:05,081 --> 01:27:06,150
We are going inside.

3543
01:27:06,151 --> 01:27:07,410
So it was all the adults.

3544
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:09,630
And Larry goes up and I'm laughing.

3545
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:11,730
He does his act and now he's sitting,

3546
01:27:11,731 --> 01:27:13,200
it was like a one of those living rooms,

3547
01:27:13,201 --> 01:27:13,741
step down,

3548
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:14,550
living room.

3549
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:19,550
So he's sitting on the step
and he's watching me and
he's laughing hysterically,

3550
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:20,731
you know,

3551
01:27:20,731 --> 01:27:21,720
and afterwards,

3552
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:22,340
you know,

3553
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:22,590
I,

3554
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:23,221
I'm asking him,

3555
01:27:23,221 --> 01:27:23,910
I go,

3556
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:26,520
you see my act every night
while you're laughing so hard.

3557
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:27,743
He goes,

3558
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:30,780
do you know what a stupid man you are?

3559
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,011
And I go,

3560
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:32,844
why?

3561
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:33,683
He goes,

3562
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:38,720
you were using a $20,000
veys as you an ashtray.

3563
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:40,980
I go,

3564
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:41,610
what did he taught?

3565
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:43,920
He goes to the big vase
that was next to you.

3566
01:27:43,921 --> 01:27:45,300
You didn't know where
to put your cigarettes.

3567
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:48,240
So you putting them in this
vase was bigger than me.

3568
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:49,500
And he goes,

3569
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:53,520
and I couldn't stop laughing because
everybody was looking at each other.

3570
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:56,730
Every time he flicked a
cigarette and this veys,

3571
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,870
he goes,

3572
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:00,110
you're a very stupid man.

3573
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:01,891
And it just,

3574
01:28:01,891 --> 01:28:03,930
his delivery would just make me laugh,

3575
01:28:03,931 --> 01:28:04,880
my balls off.

3576
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:06,331
No,

3577
01:28:06,331 --> 01:28:07,260
I love those guys.

3578
01:28:07,261 --> 01:28:07,960
And I go,

3579
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:08,191
you know,

3580
01:28:08,191 --> 01:28:11,490
Larry Miller was the guy that got me
into comic strip when I started out.

3581
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:12,301
You know?

3582
01:28:12,301 --> 01:28:14,940
And that's where it all
started with the monologist.

3583
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:15,450
Yeah.

3584
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:15,790
You know,

3585
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,100
I've always hated that,

3586
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:22,130
that whole idea that there's like a good
way to do comedy and then there's an

3587
01:28:22,521 --> 01:28:26,520
easy way to do comedy because why is it
that when I would go to see a guy like

3588
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:28,380
you or watch a guy like Joey Diaz,

3589
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,420
why is it that I laughed so hard?

3590
01:28:30,421 --> 01:28:32,940
Like what are you telling me there's
something wrong because it's balls out,

3591
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,840
but it is balls.

3592
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:34,081
I know,

3593
01:28:34,081 --> 01:28:34,591
I understand.

3594
01:28:34,591 --> 01:28:36,930
But why is anybody saying that
there's something wrong with that?

3595
01:28:36,931 --> 01:28:37,410
Like that's,

3596
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:38,191
there's a weird,

3597
01:28:38,191 --> 01:28:38,440
you know,

3598
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:38,940
it's awesome.

3599
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,250
It's awesome the way you brought up,

3600
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:41,281
you know what I mean?

3601
01:28:41,281 --> 01:28:43,120
Like these are very clean cut guys.

3602
01:28:43,121 --> 01:28:43,470
Yeah.

3603
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:43,711
You know,

3604
01:28:43,711 --> 01:28:44,520
and I love science.

3605
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,570
I liked them as a person.

3606
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:46,770
I liked him as a comic,

3607
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,070
but they will put,

3608
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:48,330
you know,

3609
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:50,250
these are guys that
actually went to college.

3610
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:50,581
You know,

3611
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:51,840
I don't know how to talk to them.

3612
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:52,680
You know,

3613
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,000
the,

3614
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,281
you know,

3615
01:28:53,281 --> 01:28:56,190
it's a different mindset education wise,

3616
01:28:56,191 --> 01:28:57,300
and I didn't understand all that,

3617
01:28:57,301 --> 01:28:57,871
but it's really,

3618
01:28:57,871 --> 01:28:58,011
it's,

3619
01:28:58,011 --> 01:28:59,370
it's a reservations.

3620
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,031
It's like they're,

3621
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:02,250
they're reserved and whereas

3622
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,250
when you see someone like you
or someone like Joey Diaz,

3623
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:06,840
it's saying something
completely outrageous.

3624
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,310
They can't go with it.

3625
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,140
They can't just relax and go with it.

3626
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:11,040
They're restricted.

3627
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:11,820
They're there,

3628
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:12,930
they're pulled back.

3629
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,250
Is that what they think?

3630
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:14,580
Yeah,

3631
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,413
there's something,

3632
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:16,470
there's,

3633
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:21,030
they just can't cut loose that you can't
be smart and enjoy good dirty joke.

3634
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:24,330
Well that's ridiculous then
you're obviously not smart
enough because you should

3635
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:27,180
be laughing at almost everything
you could possibly laugh at.

3636
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:27,571
Well,

3637
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,080
you know what,

3638
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,220
let me see one of these fucking clean
motherfuck is cell 300 arena shows and

3639
01:29:32,221 --> 01:29:33,090
then I'll give it up for them.

3640
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:34,360
It's very hard to sell an arena,

3641
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:35,040
you know?

3642
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:35,341
I mean,

3643
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:40,341
I did it over 300 of those and nobody
is ever going to top that ever 300 you

3644
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:42,450
know?

3645
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:43,950
And I did it without like,

3646
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:44,441
I don't even know,

3647
01:29:44,441 --> 01:29:48,480
arena officially 14,000 how many
thousands go anywhere from 15 to,

3648
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:48,840
you know,

3649
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:53,840
the biggest one I did was 21,500
and it was a 41 minutes sellout,

3650
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,000
almost the Brendan Byrne and Jersey.

3651
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:58,040
And uh,

3652
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,090
I mean the La Forum,

3653
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:04,120
I sold out in a couple of hours from
21,000 fucking people pictures doing

3654
01:30:04,411 --> 01:30:05,670
100,000,

3655
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:06,001
you know,

3656
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:09,600
at the rose bowl with the being the
middle act from Metallica and guns and

3657
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:10,080
roses.

3658
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:10,900
So what,

3659
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:15,900
what happens between doing these
incredible arenas and then slowly sort of

3660
01:30:16,531 --> 01:30:18,960
backing away from comedy a little bit.

3661
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,230
It was a slow thing though.

3662
01:30:22,231 --> 01:30:25,350
I did the arenas for about six years,

3663
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:29,700
till around 95 and that's
when it didn't go sour.

3664
01:30:29,701 --> 01:30:30,030
I mean,

3665
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:30,421
you know,

3666
01:30:30,421 --> 01:30:31,141
at that point,

3667
01:30:31,141 --> 01:30:31,974
you know,

3668
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,440
the movie career was sort of nonexistent,

3669
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:34,741
you know,

3670
01:30:34,741 --> 01:30:39,741
other than B movies because of the
backlash and my stand up and the press.

3671
01:30:39,841 --> 01:30:42,390
And so there were no big movies coming,

3672
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:42,781
you know,

3673
01:30:42,781 --> 01:30:44,010
if the fort failing,

3674
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,030
you know.

3675
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:47,280
But even with the arenas,

3676
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:52,340
I would do cut down arenas like 10,000
seats tonight and that went on for a

3677
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:53,071
while,

3678
01:30:53,071 --> 01:30:53,401
you know,

3679
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:54,270
then that will fight,

3680
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:55,230
you know,

3681
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,063
you d you know,

3682
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:59,010
in this day and you do 5,000 seats today.

3683
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,540
That's unreal.

3684
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,170
That's a lot of,

3685
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:01,590
you know,

3686
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:02,630
I mean rock bands that,

3687
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:02,821
you know,

3688
01:31:02,821 --> 01:31:03,840
it's a different time.

3689
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:04,740
It's a recession.

3690
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:06,540
It's just a different time.

3691
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,261
So,

3692
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:07,561
you know,

3693
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:12,360
when I see a comic doing
200015002000 seats,

3694
01:31:12,361 --> 01:31:14,100
maybe 2,500 seats,

3695
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,200
that's superstar them for a comic.

3696
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:17,041
You know,

3697
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:17,251
I mean,

3698
01:31:17,251 --> 01:31:17,820
think about it,

3699
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:21,570
2000 people a night coming
to see you is unreal.

3700
01:31:21,571 --> 01:31:22,230
It's pretty weird.

3701
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:22,800
I just,

3702
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,101
you know,

3703
01:31:23,101 --> 01:31:25,050
always had this thing in my head,

3704
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:25,891
you know,

3705
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:27,480
because I was so bad.

3706
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,351
Like I say,

3707
01:31:28,351 --> 01:31:28,591
you know,

3708
01:31:28,591 --> 01:31:30,870
my education was like nonexistent.

3709
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:31,530
I mean,

3710
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:36,180
school was just more of a place to go
and hang out and play the drums twice a

3711
01:31:36,181 --> 01:31:37,014
day,

3712
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:37,321
you know?

3713
01:31:37,321 --> 01:31:39,360
And if it wasn't for the drums and music,

3714
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:43,680
I probably wouldn't have graduated
high school because school just didn't

3715
01:31:43,681 --> 01:31:44,514
interest me.

3716
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:44,971
You know?

3717
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:46,020
That's the bottom line.

3718
01:31:46,021 --> 01:31:46,740
So,

3719
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,011
you know,

3720
01:31:47,011 --> 01:31:48,420
I wasn't good in sports.

3721
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,650
Not that I wasn't a big,

3722
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:50,760
I just wasn't,

3723
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,560
I just wasn't good at it.

3724
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,520
And you know,

3725
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,440
but a time I was 12 years old,

3726
01:31:55,441 --> 01:32:00,310
I was into all this stuff from doing
impressions to playing drums too,

3727
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:00,881
you know,

3728
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:01,990
that type of thing.

3729
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:06,760
And when I got into comedy and I saw the
kind of guys you are talking about very

3730
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:08,160
straight monologists,

3731
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:08,861
you know,

3732
01:32:08,861 --> 01:32:11,920
I just want them to be
an actor and you know,

3733
01:32:11,921 --> 01:32:15,540
use the comedy stage to
develop my acting chops and,

3734
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,500
and the dice thing happen.

3735
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,540
So I decided,

3736
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:19,691
well,

3737
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:22,240
if I'm going to stay in
this game and be a comic,

3738
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:27,670
I want to create the most
visually exciting comic
people have ever seen in the

3739
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:28,150
world,

3740
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:28,983
ever.

3741
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:29,561
You know?

3742
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:31,150
And honestly,

3743
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:31,541
you know,

3744
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:32,800
when you see the special,

3745
01:32:32,801 --> 01:32:34,630
and I got great respect
for you and what you do,

3746
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:38,030
but you're going to respect the
special I because I respect that,

3747
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,261
you know,

3748
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:38,471
but,

3749
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:38,980
but I mean,

3750
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:42,820
you'll see what I mean because
I deliver exactly what,

3751
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:43,750
you know,

3752
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:47,170
all these fans I've had through
the years want to see from me.

3753
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,480
And I like giving them
what they want to see.

3754
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:53,170
I don't want to come up there
all cleaned up with maybe,

3755
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:53,830
you know,

3756
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:54,730
not a tie,

3757
01:32:54,731 --> 01:32:55,141
but you know,

3758
01:32:55,141 --> 01:32:57,670
I was sport jacket and just black pants.

3759
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:58,301
I'm like,

3760
01:32:58,301 --> 01:32:59,134
for what?

3761
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,070
You know what I mean?

3762
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,630
This is how I like to dress.

3763
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:01,990
Like,

3764
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,320
you know,

3765
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,150
I look good enough to dress in it,

3766
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:04,661
you know?

3767
01:33:04,661 --> 01:33:08,260
So why not just deliver what they want
to see and just pound them over to

3768
01:33:08,261 --> 01:33:13,261
fucking heads with the filthy shit
that I could come up with because we're

3769
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:17,230
living in the filthiest time with
the filthiest fucking people.

3770
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:20,710
But yet the backlash is the
strongest it's ever been.

3771
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,573
You know?

3772
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,920
But I don't care about
the backlash anymore.

3773
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:26,470
Years ago I did because I didn't get it,

3774
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,131
you know,

3775
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:28,720
because guys came before me,

3776
01:33:28,721 --> 01:33:29,531
everybody from,

3777
01:33:29,531 --> 01:33:30,310
you know,

3778
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,210
Eddie Murphy,

3779
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:32,110
Richard Pryor,

3780
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:33,220
guys like some gone,

3781
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,900
what am I doing any different than them,

3782
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:36,310
you know what I mean?

3783
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:40,150
And so now I'm at a point in my
life where if you don't like me,

3784
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:41,770
who gives a fuck for you?

3785
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:42,700
You know,

3786
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,630
I don't give a fuck.

3787
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:44,770
If you see tomorrow,

3788
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,940
that's how I think about it.

3789
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,200
If a writer writes,

3790
01:33:47,201 --> 01:33:49,900
if a journalist writes me
up like a bad write up,

3791
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:50,501
I'm like,

3792
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:51,520
well what do I give a fuck?

3793
01:33:51,521 --> 01:33:52,690
Do I notice the person,

3794
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:53,661
the white care,

3795
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:54,970
what they fucking feel?

3796
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:56,410
They're the ones writing me up.

3797
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:56,741
Well,

3798
01:33:56,741 --> 01:33:57,010
and it's,

3799
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:57,790
it's not,

3800
01:33:57,790 --> 01:34:00,030
it's never fair cost for them Joe.

3801
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:00,850
It's like,

3802
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:05,440
would a jazz critic
review a hip hop concert?

3803
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:05,801
No.

3804
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:06,610
Why would they?

3805
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:07,510
It doesn't make any sense.

3806
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:08,590
So for someone to be,

3807
01:34:08,591 --> 01:34:09,290
you know,

3808
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:10,510
a comedy critic,

3809
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,350
it's like wow,

3810
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,621
you know,

3811
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:13,240
there's a lot of
different kinds of comedy.

3812
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:13,721
You know,

3813
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:16,380
he just because you have a specific taste,

3814
01:34:16,381 --> 01:34:18,800
a personal taste doesn't mean
the other competence I come from.

3815
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:19,930
It's not for you.

3816
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:20,860
I come from,

3817
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,191
you know,

3818
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:21,821
like I said,

3819
01:34:21,821 --> 01:34:23,140
like I like dealing with,

3820
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:23,501
you know,

3821
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:27,580
I love seeing the uncomfortability
of people in the front row.

3822
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:31,600
I loved live performance
and that's one of the fun.

3823
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:33,970
And if you're a clean up day,

3824
01:34:33,971 --> 01:34:34,804
like,

3825
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,320
you know,

3826
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,330
I just don't think I would have any fun.

3827
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,550
I have fun like watching
the guy and like I said,

3828
01:34:39,551 --> 01:34:41,650
like Gaf again or watching
the guy and like Seinfeld,

3829
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:42,880
but it's not the same kind of fun.

3830
01:34:42,881 --> 01:34:42,971
Yeah.

3831
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:43,620
But you know,

3832
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:44,860
Seinfeld's one of a kind.

3833
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:45,191
Yeah.

3834
01:34:45,191 --> 01:34:46,660
But it's not the same kind of fun.

3835
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:47,261
It's still not the same.

3836
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:50,620
She kind of fun is like watching a guy
like you because Watson guy like you,

3837
01:34:50,621 --> 01:34:53,710
you will say the most
ridiculous shit ever.

3838
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,710
One of the things that I was
howling is when I came back stairs,

3839
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:00,500
a backstage afterwards and I
was talking to me about it.

3840
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:01,311
Go then you're like,

3841
01:35:01,311 --> 01:35:03,650
I don't do any research
like we were talking about.

3842
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:04,813
How does that,

3843
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:05,370
yeah,

3844
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:07,630
it's just about the fucking lady.

3845
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:10,610
It was like how you were just like
breaking down the whole process.

3846
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:11,600
I do no research.

3847
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,080
Well,

3848
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,610
I claim no responsibility.

3849
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:14,713
No response.

3850
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:17,000
If I was running for office,

3851
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,610
I'd have to do a little
research for comedy.

3852
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,940
That's what I try to explain it.

3853
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:21,771
And that album,

3854
01:35:21,771 --> 01:35:23,600
that data left the died dead.

3855
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:25,010
It's just about funny.

3856
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:25,610
Right?

3857
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:26,900
I don't care what it is,

3858
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:28,700
just be fucking funny.

3859
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,050
And I got my roles,

3860
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:30,884
like I won't,

3861
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:31,281
you know,

3862
01:35:31,281 --> 01:35:33,620
bring up a disaster
where people get killed.

3863
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:34,660
You know what I mean?

3864
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:35,900
We'll make fun of John Travolta.

3865
01:35:35,901 --> 01:35:37,010
You have strong rules.

3866
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:37,250
Yeah,

3867
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,840
I do have strong rules and that way,

3868
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:39,111
you know,

3869
01:35:39,111 --> 01:35:40,370
like what happened with the hurricane,

3870
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,710
there's no jokes for me
when it comes to that stuff,

3871
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:43,371
you know,

3872
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:44,380
because you know,

3873
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:48,290
people are getting killed and there's
families that are morning these people.

3874
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:49,123
So it's like,

3875
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,960
where do I have the right
to make fun of that,

3876
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:51,771
you know?

3877
01:35:51,771 --> 01:35:53,780
So I try to stay away
from that kind of stuff,

3878
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:55,100
but when it comes to sex,

3879
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:55,880
come on,

3880
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,840
it's just sex,

3881
01:35:56,841 --> 01:35:57,770
so it's okay.

3882
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,710
Did you ever feel like at a time that
you ever crossed the line though?

3883
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:01,011
It's like,

3884
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:02,300
did you ever say anything,

3885
01:36:02,301 --> 01:36:03,140
whether it's about,

3886
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:03,620
uh,

3887
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:07,850
immigrants or gay people or
anything when it comes to people,

3888
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:08,331
you know,

3889
01:36:08,331 --> 01:36:08,601
like,

3890
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:09,434
you know,

3891
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:09,801
you know,

3892
01:36:09,801 --> 01:36:12,040
when I make fun of Asians
and call them China,

3893
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:12,501
man,

3894
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:12,831
you know,

3895
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:13,790
it's just funny.

3896
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,800
It's a funny word than Asian,

3897
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:17,143
you know what I mean?

3898
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:18,650
Chinaman Chink.

3899
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:19,670
It's all funny.

3900
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:20,571
You know?

3901
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:21,860
It's a great word.

3902
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:22,491
Well,

3903
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:25,910
if it was an angry Chinese dude though
staring at you while you were talking

3904
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:27,170
about I do it right to,

3905
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:27,471
you know,

3906
01:36:27,471 --> 01:36:32,380
I talk about fat girls and sometimes I
got six in the front row and I'm gone.

3907
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:32,841
All right,

3908
01:36:32,841 --> 01:36:34,790
so how much does the fat girl,

3909
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:39,640
I talk about half the weight night because
I've had some bees sitting fucking in

3910
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:39,981
front,

3911
01:36:39,981 --> 01:36:41,240
so I'll have to double her.

3912
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:44,750
My wife says fat girls love
me because I talk about them,

3913
01:36:44,751 --> 01:36:48,080
but you know when I'm talking about
a chick that to picket in the bed,

3914
01:36:48,081 --> 01:36:49,160
I'm fucking around.

3915
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:49,941
You know?

3916
01:36:49,941 --> 01:36:50,774
It's funny,

3917
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:51,441
you know,

3918
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:53,220
because no girl in the
crowd is going to go,

3919
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:55,430
I'm not bigger than an eastern king.

3920
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,820
You know what I mean?

3921
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:00,050
They look at themselves like little
cause I'm not looking to hurt him.

3922
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:01,730
I'm just looking to be funny,

3923
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:02,600
you know?

3924
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,190
And and let them laugh too.

3925
01:37:04,191 --> 01:37:05,900
Fat Girls are allowed to laugh.

3926
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:06,801
They are.

3927
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:10,160
But dental particularly fucking
blubber starts to jiggle and shit.

3928
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,590
They don't pretend to like
fat girl jokes though,

3929
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:13,910
in my experience.

3930
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:14,541
Oh really?

3931
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:15,020
Yeah,

3932
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:15,590
I dunno.

3933
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:17,600
Maybe it's just the way
I deliver my crowds.

3934
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:20,510
They really like it.

3935
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:24,050
They're literally rolling
in the fucking oil.

3936
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:25,161
You know?

3937
01:37:25,161 --> 01:37:28,520
I've had a girl throw herself on the
floor and start rolling around that.

3938
01:37:28,521 --> 01:37:29,241
I'm looking like,

3939
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:30,590
this is hysterical.

3940
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:32,310
It happened once to speak.

3941
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:32,700
You know,

3942
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:36,290
I've had a heck of a fight with
an 86 year old woman really,

3943
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:39,580
that I had to come into the middle of a
crowd on a New Year's eve and just where

3944
01:37:39,581 --> 01:37:40,610
was this big kiss?

3945
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:42,380
It was in San Antonio,

3946
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:43,190
Texas.

3947
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:43,940
God Damn.

3948
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:44,300
Yeah,

3949
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,310
and this 86 she was like,

3950
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:46,971
yeah,

3951
01:37:46,971 --> 01:37:47,391
I know that.

3952
01:37:47,391 --> 01:37:49,670
Not whatever part of America,

3953
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:52,760
I don't follow the map that
much with the geographical shit,

3954
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:53,810
but it's not,

3955
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:55,250
but she sounded southern.

3956
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:55,921
You know what I man,

3957
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:56,340
Antonio,

3958
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:56,790
Texas.

3959
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:56,970
Yeah.

3960
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:59,640
They have that Wang today and she's like,

3961
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:01,950
it was like one of those skinny,

3962
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:06,270
she was 86 or 80 [inaudible]
slapping [inaudible] gone.

3963
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:09,840
You dirty mother fucker.

3964
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:12,090
You are a dirty.

3965
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:14,340
And she's as filthy as me,

3966
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:15,090
you know,

3967
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:16,920
that was one of my greatest heckle and,

3968
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:18,170
and it's something I didn't get on.

3969
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,170
I wasn't even filming.

3970
01:38:19,171 --> 01:38:19,660
Babs,

3971
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:22,260
Holly Know 27 you know,

3972
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:23,161
and yeah,

3973
01:38:23,161 --> 01:38:26,120
I've had some great heckle
fights in the days where,

3974
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,890
where they would actually
look to throw lines at you,

3975
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:29,670
you know,

3976
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,980
rather than just being drunk.

3977
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:33,690
Are you fucking suck?

3978
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:34,290
Well,

3979
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:37,770
especially on what do you do with that
for the store or some of the worst places

3980
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:38,500
ever,

3981
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:38,820
you know,

3982
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:41,700
for Hecklin the first of
all because there's no crowd
control and second of all,

3983
01:38:41,701 --> 01:38:44,460
because Hollywood is always filled
with people that are unhappy.

3984
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:45,090
They,

3985
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,130
most people are not
achieving their dreams here.

3986
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,050
The majority of people are struggling.

3987
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:49,490
Sale.

3988
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:49,800
Yeah,

3989
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,633
the majority.

3990
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,040
And you've got a lot of
like want to be actors,

3991
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:54,300
want to be musicians,

3992
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:54,730
want to.

3993
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:56,130
If you're at the comedy store and go,

3994
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:56,731
well what are you doing?

3995
01:38:56,731 --> 01:38:57,564
Well I'm an actor.

3996
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:57,930
Okay,

3997
01:38:57,930 --> 01:38:58,763
good for you.

3998
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,340
But that guy could wind up a superstar.

3999
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:02,900
The place it's,

4000
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:03,301
look,

4001
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:04,134
it is possible,

4002
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:05,310
but fun to Piss on it.

4003
01:39:05,311 --> 01:39:08,550
There's a lot of that bitterness that's
in the air and there's a lot of that in

4004
01:39:08,551 --> 01:39:08,971
the crowd.

4005
01:39:08,971 --> 01:39:11,160
It was one of the reasons why it's such
a good place to work out because that

4006
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:12,420
was not an impressed audience.

4007
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,130
They were not impressed with you

4008
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:17,590
the other day by a guy in a wheelchair
and he comes there I guess once in a

4009
01:39:17,591 --> 01:39:17,981
while,

4010
01:39:17,981 --> 01:39:19,630
but he can't talk or move.

4011
01:39:19,631 --> 01:39:22,870
Like he has like one of those where he
just has like a thousand computers and

4012
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:25,920
cell phones in front of them and they
put him right in the front and he,

4013
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,441
wait a minute,

4014
01:39:26,441 --> 01:39:28,030
he has cell phones and computers,

4015
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:30,370
everything but like a fax machine.

4016
01:39:30,371 --> 01:39:32,110
His hands work like his hand.

4017
01:39:32,111 --> 01:39:36,340
One Hand works to move on one hand it's
just pushing iPad buttons and stuff and

4018
01:39:36,341 --> 01:39:37,174
doing things.

4019
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,830
But he talks through that.

4020
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:39,330
He,

4021
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:39,670
I,

4022
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:40,271
he doesn't really talk,

4023
01:39:40,271 --> 01:39:42,070
he just goes like that.

4024
01:39:42,071 --> 01:39:46,090
And so while you're on stage they put
them right in the front row to the whole

4025
01:39:46,091 --> 01:39:47,080
show is just don't know.

4026
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:48,460
But then he can,

4027
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:53,460
he'll say something that that
means like non stuff like that.

4028
01:39:53,591 --> 01:39:56,650
And he's just fucking saying these
horrible things the whole time.

4029
01:39:56,651 --> 01:39:57,311
And then he's like that.

4030
01:39:57,311 --> 01:39:58,144
He's a track.

4031
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,230
Right.

4032
01:39:59,230 --> 01:39:59,591
Wow.

4033
01:39:59,591 --> 01:40:00,520
He wants you to blow him.

4034
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:00,931
But,

4035
01:40:00,931 --> 01:40:01,180
but no,

4036
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,280
he's like he's just fucking with you.

4037
01:40:03,281 --> 01:40:06,700
And he just fucks with every single
comic and he sits there from like uh,

4038
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,190
it's like seven o'clock or whatever that,

4039
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:08,611
that,

4040
01:40:08,611 --> 01:40:11,940
that open mic show all
the way to like come out.

4041
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,210
I don't know.

4042
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,710
It drives everybody.

4043
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:14,880
Yeah.

4044
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,550
Yeah cause it,

4045
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:17,550
that's a club like to work the new stuff.

4046
01:40:17,551 --> 01:40:22,090
And it always sucks when you have a guy
that you just have to handle rather than

4047
01:40:22,091 --> 01:40:22,980
working material.

4048
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:23,500
Yeah.

4049
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,430
Well the other problem is when someone
before you doesn't deal with the Hackler

4050
01:40:27,431 --> 01:40:30,010
and then you got to go up and then
it's already out of control cause they

4051
01:40:30,011 --> 01:40:33,610
already feel like that's a part of the
show and they like continue the bullshit.

4052
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:34,870
Well and also,

4053
01:40:34,871 --> 01:40:35,681
let's be honest,

4054
01:40:35,681 --> 01:40:36,371
at the comedy store,

4055
01:40:36,371 --> 01:40:37,700
there's a lot of fucking people that,

4056
01:40:37,730 --> 01:40:38,770
that they just,

4057
01:40:38,771 --> 01:40:40,760
for whatever reason they're
still doing standup,

4058
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:43,660
but they checked out a long time ago
and showed us sort of going through the

4059
01:40:43,661 --> 01:40:45,850
motions and it's not very good material.

4060
01:40:45,851 --> 01:40:47,380
And for whatever reason,

4061
01:40:47,381 --> 01:40:49,180
they don't have any talent
for whatever reason.

4062
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:53,850
And you'll see them go on stage and then
these hackers started eating them and

4063
01:40:53,851 --> 01:40:54,180
then

4064
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,700
you have to go up and back,

4065
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:56,543
clean up,

4066
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,840
clean up on aisle nine.

4067
01:40:57,841 --> 01:40:58,220
You know,

4068
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:59,053
Christ

4069
01:40:59,100 --> 01:40:59,933
do go on.

4070
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,040
I always make like there's
nobody on before me,

4071
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:02,821
you know,

4072
01:41:02,821 --> 01:41:04,170
and just start from zero.

4073
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:07,710
I don't care if somebody had a
fight with somebody in the crowd.

4074
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,480
I'm not going up there to like,

4075
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:13,080
like it's like you're
saying like just one comic,

4076
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:14,363
you know,

4077
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:15,263
like the whole,

4078
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:17,460
the whole lineup is one comic,

4079
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,241
you know,

4080
01:41:18,241 --> 01:41:20,610
getting into it with this one person,

4081
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:21,241
you know,

4082
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:26,100
I just start from zero and if somebody
says something dice mean comes out and

4083
01:41:26,101 --> 01:41:27,750
hopefully I handle it right there.

4084
01:41:27,751 --> 01:41:30,960
And then the comedy store was
the best workout for that place.

4085
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:31,471
It's just,

4086
01:41:31,471 --> 01:41:32,251
it's the greatest,

4087
01:41:32,251 --> 01:41:32,431
you know,

4088
01:41:32,431 --> 01:41:33,780
I've gone through a lot of stuff.

4089
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:34,081
You know,

4090
01:41:34,081 --> 01:41:36,660
I used to get to open Fetty
Murphy there all the time.

4091
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:41,580
Mitzi would use me to know to go on after
him cause nobody wants to go on after

4092
01:41:41,581 --> 01:41:41,820
him.

4093
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:42,320
Yeah.

4094
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,790
You know and that,

4095
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:44,221
you know,

4096
01:41:44,221 --> 01:41:46,860
those kinds of things that
like an honor at that time,

4097
01:41:47,370 --> 01:41:47,761
you know,

4098
01:41:47,761 --> 01:41:50,190
and you know that's how you
got to meet some of those guys.

4099
01:41:50,191 --> 01:41:51,170
Like you know,

4100
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:52,560
and Murphy was always like,

4101
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:56,220
and I didn't understand it at the time
when he would be like nervous to go out

4102
01:41:56,221 --> 01:41:59,100
there like on a Monday night
in the main room and I go,

4103
01:41:59,101 --> 01:42:01,200
what are you nervous
about that all he a feel,

4104
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,070
you know,

4105
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:04,680
I didn't get it because
once you have that fame,

4106
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:06,690
now you have to live up to it.

4107
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,010
And I did not,

4108
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:10,410
I was just excited about
going on after the guy,

4109
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:10,980
you know,

4110
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:15,780
I got to follow prior at the store after
the burn incident and everybody was

4111
01:42:15,781 --> 01:42:16,680
coming to see him.

4112
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:20,220
I mean you had Sammy Davis sitting
on the floor with his legs folded.

4113
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,780
You had Burt Reynolds,

4114
01:42:21,781 --> 01:42:22,920
there was Sally fields,

4115
01:42:22,921 --> 01:42:27,690
you had to narrow their with Scorsese
and I will come up there like I was

4116
01:42:27,691 --> 01:42:32,460
playing a bowling alley and just go into
it and just make sure I kicked their

4117
01:42:32,461 --> 01:42:33,660
ass every time.

4118
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:38,460
Mitzi putting you on after a strong
acts was a big move for everybody.

4119
01:42:38,461 --> 01:42:42,930
Big Move for me and one of the
guys that I had to I you a lot.

4120
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:45,410
I followed you a lot in the early days.

4121
01:42:45,411 --> 01:42:47,000
Like in the 94 ish.

4122
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:47,450
Wow.

4123
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:48,620
When I first started coming there,

4124
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:53,090
she would throw me on FTU I filed prior
cause you need to follow an animal and

4125
01:42:53,091 --> 01:42:53,751
not only that,

4126
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:54,201
it's a,

4127
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:58,550
it's good for you to go on after someone
strong because you realize you can't

4128
01:42:58,551 --> 01:43:00,390
have any fluff in your attic
and know many bullshit.

4129
01:43:00,391 --> 01:43:01,880
You've got to cut right
to the funny stuff.

4130
01:43:01,881 --> 01:43:02,190
You've got to,

4131
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:04,190
you impress them right away,

4132
01:43:04,191 --> 01:43:05,420
get them right off the bat,

4133
01:43:05,421 --> 01:43:06,440
hold onto them.

4134
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:07,340
You know,

4135
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:07,851
it was like,

4136
01:43:07,851 --> 01:43:09,980
it's a good exercise in learning.

4137
01:43:09,981 --> 01:43:11,780
Like especially when
they love the guy before,

4138
01:43:11,781 --> 01:43:16,781
like you would be up fucking destroy and
then some unknown person has to go on

4139
01:43:16,851 --> 01:43:17,540
after you.

4140
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:18,373
That's what she,

4141
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,970
that's where Mitzi makes it.

4142
01:43:19,971 --> 01:43:20,420
Yes.

4143
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:23,510
She picked the right guy for
that and Martin Lawrence,

4144
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:25,160
I used to go and have to
go on and after him a lot.

4145
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,690
I never followed mark.

4146
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,180
Martin was in his prime.

4147
01:43:29,181 --> 01:43:29,631
I'll tell you,

4148
01:43:29,631 --> 01:43:33,200
Martin did not have as long a prime is
a lot of people did for whatever reason.

4149
01:43:33,201 --> 01:43:36,830
And he got into movies and it kind of
doesn't do as much special and I love him.

4150
01:43:36,831 --> 01:43:41,000
He's like one of my all time
fucking hilarious and all my God,

4151
01:43:41,001 --> 01:43:43,790
he destroyed the main room at the inn.

4152
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:44,750
At the comedy store ones.

4153
01:43:44,751 --> 01:43:45,110
Yeah,

4154
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:50,110
just leveled the place and I had to go
on after him because he was just funny.

4155
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:52,130
Just look at him as funny,

4156
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:53,211
you know what I mean?

4157
01:43:53,211 --> 01:43:55,160
And he knew it and he play off of it,

4158
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:55,590
you know,

4159
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:56,810
he's one of my favorites.

4160
01:43:56,990 --> 01:44:01,230
I mean I felt like a rank amateur when
I had to go on after him also because

4161
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:04,400
especially if it's one of those
nights in the main room with that guy,

4162
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:05,243
his audience,

4163
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,880
and he's talking on stage.

4164
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:09,020
Most people got up and left.

4165
01:44:09,021 --> 01:44:09,381
It was,

4166
01:44:09,381 --> 01:44:13,490
it was only like maybe 20% of the people
stayed and even them I was just like

4167
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,630
this and he's out there now.

4168
01:44:14,631 --> 01:44:16,230
He's doing consciously doing it again.

4169
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:16,940
He is.

4170
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:17,241
I mean,

4171
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:18,290
I don't know how big it is.

4172
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:18,740
I Dunno,

4173
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,270
you know the schedule but,

4174
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:23,090
but I know he was at the
store really work and stuff.

4175
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:24,583
Well that's great.

4176
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:26,510
I hope he can bring it back to form.

4177
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:28,640
He was when he was on top of it.

4178
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:29,503
You know what he's,

4179
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:30,260
he's great.

4180
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,430
He's great in the movies.

4181
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:32,211
I love him.

4182
01:44:32,211 --> 01:44:33,260
I love Eddie Murphy,

4183
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:33,651
you know,

4184
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:35,180
as far as you know,

4185
01:44:35,181 --> 01:44:36,470
raw comics go.

4186
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:37,400
But Martin,

4187
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:42,080
I always loved him the best because it
was his actions on state and he's a guy

4188
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:43,580
that knew how to play the stage.

4189
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:45,890
He'd be all over the place.

4190
01:44:45,891 --> 01:44:47,660
I mean I loved his first special,

4191
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:48,471
you know.

4192
01:44:48,471 --> 01:44:50,120
What was your first years at the store?

4193
01:44:50,121 --> 01:44:50,954
What year was it?

4194
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,280
I came out this still,

4195
01:44:52,281 --> 01:44:52,610
it was,

4196
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:57,610
it was the beginning of 79 February
79 fucking seventies holy shit.

4197
01:44:58,730 --> 01:45:01,910
And you guys were living in that house
on your ass arrest till I almost bought

4198
01:45:01,911 --> 01:45:02,744
that place.

4199
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,350
Couldn't have a big enough
yard for the dogs though.

4200
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,550
I think there is no yard.

4201
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,930
There's no yard off the mountain.

4202
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:11,900
I looked at it and I was
living in that house.

4203
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,680
That house was crazy house.

4204
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:15,980
You got some fucking history to it.

4205
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:16,220
Yeah.

4206
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,210
That's a crazy house.

4207
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,800
That's the only reason why
I was thinking about it.

4208
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:19,101
I was like,

4209
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:20,360
this is such a historic,

4210
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:20,991
everybody,

4211
01:45:20,991 --> 01:45:21,291
you know,

4212
01:45:21,291 --> 01:45:23,450
Robin used to come up there all the time,

4213
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,470
you know,

4214
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:27,050
some of the bigger name and I
wouldn't even talk to these guys.

4215
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:31,610
I would never talk to a big name
celebrity unless they would talk to me,

4216
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:32,571
you know?

4217
01:45:32,571 --> 01:45:33,404
And uh,

4218
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,240
cause I know what the thinking,

4219
01:45:35,241 --> 01:45:36,350
the minute you say hello,

4220
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:38,570
what movie you're doing
and what's my part right.

4221
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:39,170
You know,

4222
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:41,520
I would never bother even when
Robin would come up to the house.

4223
01:45:41,521 --> 01:45:42,354
So was like,

4224
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:43,220
just stay away,

4225
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:44,683
you know,

4226
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:45,321
and uh,

4227
01:45:45,321 --> 01:45:46,400
I mean great talent,

4228
01:45:46,401 --> 01:45:48,400
but I wouldn't look to
get in his face and go,

4229
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:49,400
well I'm doing this.

4230
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,650
And I used to have to follow him to it.

4231
01:45:51,651 --> 01:45:52,250
The store.

4232
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:54,950
Well you knew intuitively that
it would be annoying as fuck.

4233
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,380
That's what gets me when I go there.

4234
01:45:57,381 --> 01:45:57,651
You know,

4235
01:45:57,651 --> 01:45:58,311
these guys,

4236
01:45:58,311 --> 01:46:00,560
you know the cross the
boundary a lot of times,

4237
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:01,580
you know,

4238
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:02,211
and then they want,

4239
01:46:02,211 --> 01:46:02,890
you know,

4240
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:04,760
it starts with the pictures and you know,

4241
01:46:04,761 --> 01:46:06,440
I'm a comic and you know,

4242
01:46:06,441 --> 01:46:08,480
they want to be buddy
buddy in once and I can't,

4243
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:08,691
you know,

4244
01:46:08,691 --> 01:46:09,680
I don't work that way.

4245
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:10,131
Yeah.

4246
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:14,780
Some guy hit me with a fucking a sales
pitch the other day after a show.

4247
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:15,490
We just cool,

4248
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:20,270
I'm down from the show but I was taking
photos with this whole line of people

4249
01:46:20,271 --> 01:46:23,720
and this guy just starts rattling
off the sales pitch and just,

4250
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,960
I mean it's going on for several minutes
and I'm just supposed to listen and I

4251
01:46:26,961 --> 01:46:30,140
just can't start out the patient
and after a while I go do it.

4252
01:46:30,141 --> 01:46:30,790
Stop.

4253
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:31,520
I can't do that.

4254
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,060
Stop.

4255
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,670
I don't have any time for anything and
I'm definitely not going to go into

4256
01:46:34,671 --> 01:46:35,211
business with you.

4257
01:46:35,211 --> 01:46:36,020
I don't even know you.

4258
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:36,853
This is crazy.

4259
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:40,280
But the sales pitch was just ready go.

4260
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:41,540
Like this is opportunity.

4261
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:43,080
But that's also what,

4262
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:43,550
you know,

4263
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:44,480
like directed energy.

4264
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:45,980
It's what the new generationZ ,

4265
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,390
that's what gets me like,

4266
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:49,990
you know when you grow up and
all you're is looking down at

4267
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:50,823
your phone,

4268
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:55,750
you know when it finally you hit that
age where you have to start communicating

4269
01:46:55,751 --> 01:46:57,220
face to face with people.

4270
01:46:57,221 --> 01:46:58,510
They don't know how to do it.

4271
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:00,250
You've got to shake someone's hand.

4272
01:47:00,251 --> 01:47:02,080
It's like shaking a fucking limp.

4273
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03,370
Fucking Dick.

4274
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:04,330
You know?

4275
01:47:04,330 --> 01:47:06,010
They don't even know
how to give a firm grip.

4276
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:08,200
Know what the fuck is that about?

4277
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:09,031
What is that about?

4278
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:09,111
No,

4279
01:47:09,111 --> 01:47:09,881
but I'm serious.

4280
01:47:09,881 --> 01:47:11,860
That says something about
somebody's character.

4281
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:12,460
Well,

4282
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:12,850
you know,

4283
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:13,511
if you can say,

4284
01:47:13,511 --> 01:47:13,721
yeah,

4285
01:47:13,721 --> 01:47:14,580
how you doing?

4286
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:15,221
You know,

4287
01:47:15,221 --> 01:47:16,054
and it's like,

4288
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:16,451
I'm like,

4289
01:47:16,451 --> 01:47:17,290
what is that?

4290
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,210
It's for a lot of people,

4291
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,860
it's not no people skills.

4292
01:47:20,861 --> 01:47:21,694
I'm telling you,

4293
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:22,720
they don't want to be manly.

4294
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:23,800
I can't handle it.

4295
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:24,730
It's not about the men.

4296
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:29,380
They just don't know how to relate to
you unless the texting to you or emailing

4297
01:47:29,381 --> 01:47:29,800
to you.

4298
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,960
They just don't know how
to have conversation.

4299
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,280
You know?

4300
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,780
There's definitely a lot of that going on.

4301
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:35,520
This is,

4302
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:40,520
there's a lot of people that are growing
up in a society that is more and more

4303
01:47:40,781 --> 01:47:45,490
encouraging people to control themselves
and to calm themselves down and to not

4304
01:47:45,491 --> 01:47:49,570
have as much fun and to be more conscious
of how other people are going to view

4305
01:47:49,571 --> 01:47:51,550
things and be more sensitive.

4306
01:47:51,551 --> 01:47:52,690
Personality in school,

4307
01:47:52,691 --> 01:47:53,790
they want to put them on Rhydlin.

4308
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:54,843
Yeah,

4309
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,020
I mean it's the crate.

4310
01:47:56,021 --> 01:47:59,950
They want kids sitting like mute and
they want to pretend that school is

4311
01:47:59,951 --> 01:48:00,520
interesting.

4312
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:04,450
It's not interesting like the whole
policy of breaking a child down,

4313
01:48:04,451 --> 01:48:08,740
getting them to sit in position and
absorb information that they don't find

4314
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:09,603
attractive.

4315
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:14,140
That whole policy is conditioning someone
to just listen and be a fucking drone.

4316
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:14,771
That's what it is.

4317
01:48:14,771 --> 01:48:18,070
It's not the best way to learn by far
by any stretch of the imagination.

4318
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:22,480
A best way to learn would be some sort
of a one on one instruction where you

4319
01:48:22,481 --> 01:48:26,770
know you get to explain to them things
over and over again and you get to answer

4320
01:48:26,771 --> 01:48:27,461
all questions.

4321
01:48:27,461 --> 01:48:28,260
I was saying

4322
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,470
when we went to school,

4323
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:33,340
at least you could have a
personality in that classroom today.

4324
01:48:33,341 --> 01:48:37,150
If you're not just quiet and
sitting there like you're saying,

4325
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:38,130
you know you're not a

4326
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:38,660
good students.

4327
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,660
That's Matt and sit this,

4328
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:41,730
the quiet and sitting
there as the madness,

4329
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:43,800
the ability to just sit there.

4330
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:46,410
I remember when I was a little kid
and they would want me to sit down.

4331
01:48:46,411 --> 01:48:49,650
You'd be all of a sudden like you're
listening to something that's not fun at

4332
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:52,500
all after you've just gotten done
running around with your friends

4333
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:52,851
and I,

4334
01:48:52,851 --> 01:48:57,250
I wonder what even goes on now cause
to the phones and the iPads and all the

4335
01:48:57,251 --> 01:48:58,810
shit they bring to school now.

4336
01:48:59,290 --> 01:48:59,591
You know.

4337
01:48:59,591 --> 01:49:00,251
Does that even,

4338
01:49:00,251 --> 01:49:01,084
you know,

4339
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:03,180
do your kids tell you what that stuff,

4340
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,510
I'm sure they're listening to
music in class with her head.

4341
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:07,983
Let's go.

4342
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:08,791
It must drive.

4343
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:10,790
The teacher's fucking bizarre.

4344
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:12,300
It must the end.

4345
01:49:12,301 --> 01:49:13,081
You know what this is?

4346
01:49:13,081 --> 01:49:17,430
Just wait til they got those fucking
Google glasses and you know the of these

4347
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:18,840
glasses that they're coming out with it.

4348
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:20,220
You were and you,

4349
01:49:20,221 --> 01:49:25,050
you're seeing things in the glasses
like emails and you can get a website.

4350
01:49:25,610 --> 01:49:25,941
Yeah,

4351
01:49:25,941 --> 01:49:26,220
it's good.

4352
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,420
Especially with glasses like yours.

4353
01:49:27,421 --> 01:49:28,201
Nice big ones.

4354
01:49:28,201 --> 01:49:29,250
This is a bigger screen,

4355
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:29,860
but you'll see any,

4356
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,080
see all your shit up there.

4357
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:32,280
You can see all your photos.

4358
01:49:32,281 --> 01:49:35,220
You can be fucking you flipping through
them by using your finger in the air.

4359
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:36,293
I'm not joking.

4360
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:36,601
No,

4361
01:49:36,601 --> 01:49:37,241
but it's fun.

4362
01:49:37,241 --> 01:49:37,921
It's crazy.

4363
01:49:37,921 --> 01:49:39,360
Sitting in class like this.

4364
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:40,620
You are literally,

4365
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:44,490
you'll be able to do that and do that
in front of your eyes and make them move

4366
01:49:44,491 --> 01:49:46,950
and you'll be able to pick
ones and stretch them.

4367
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,040
Going to deal with

4368
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,610
that shit.

4369
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:49,140
They're not,

4370
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,500
they're going to have to have rules.

4371
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:50,820
Yeah,

4372
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:51,460
with that shit.

4373
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,710
It'll be a called a like
a no touch interface.

4374
01:49:53,711 --> 01:49:55,510
It'll all be like finger movements.

4375
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,100
You just be doing things with your finger.

4376
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:58,240
It's going to be fucking insane.

4377
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,820
And that's just the beginning,

4378
01:50:00,821 --> 01:50:01,270
you know?

4379
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:01,530
Let's see.

4380
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:04,300
It's going to keep going further and
further until you get something implanted

4381
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:05,350
into your fucking eyeball.

4382
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,390
They have contact lenses to now to do it.

4383
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:08,443
Uh,

4384
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:09,453
you know,

4385
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:10,623
that's enough for me.

4386
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,520
I don't believe in context.

4387
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:13,354
They never did.

4388
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:16,860
But the contact lenses that
allow you to see contacts,

4389
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:17,890
not at all,

4390
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:18,370
nothing.

4391
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:18,790
Why?

4392
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:19,750
I just don't believe in them.

4393
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,800
But you believe in glasses.

4394
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:23,470
Do you have like a lasix issue?

4395
01:50:23,471 --> 01:50:25,150
Could you go do not?

4396
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:25,930
No,

4397
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:26,471
you wouldn't do it.

4398
01:50:26,471 --> 01:50:27,490
I'm just nearsighted.

4399
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:27,851
Oh,

4400
01:50:27,851 --> 01:50:28,210
okay.

4401
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:28,420
You know,

4402
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:31,270
so I try to weigh at like sunglasses
that people could see through.

4403
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:31,570
You know,

4404
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:31,890
there the,

4405
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,711
you could see me good,

4406
01:50:32,711 --> 01:50:32,910
right?

4407
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:33,580
Yeah.

4408
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:34,030
Um,

4409
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:34,440
do you,

4410
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,150
so near side it means things
that are close to you.

4411
01:50:36,151 --> 01:50:36,720
You have a hard time.

4412
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,560
Things that like kind of far away.

4413
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:39,130
Oh,

4414
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:40,990
so you see things close?

4415
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:41,853
Fine.

4416
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:42,400
Yeah.

4417
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,233
But things are,

4418
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:43,540
hmm.

4419
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:44,020
I thought that was,

4420
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,100
and when you're farsighted,

4421
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:46,960
that's where you can
see things right here.

4422
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:47,411
That's me,

4423
01:50:47,411 --> 01:50:47,860
man.

4424
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:48,390
Yeah,

4425
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:49,240
I'm chat.

4426
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:50,133
Do you wear glasses?

4427
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:50,650
No,

4428
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:51,483
it's not that bad.

4429
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:52,421
I mean I can like,

4430
01:50:52,421 --> 01:50:53,850
I can read my shit

4431
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:57,460
this special.

4432
01:50:57,490 --> 01:50:58,131
No,

4433
01:50:58,131 --> 01:50:59,240
it can't be a dentist classes.

4434
01:50:59,540 --> 01:50:59,810
Right?

4435
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:02,230
Like he can actually like
still look at his phone.

4436
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:03,940
I can look at my phone
when you're talking about,

4437
01:51:03,941 --> 01:51:04,774
you're exaggerating.

4438
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:06,311
It's not big.

4439
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:07,144
I stopped doing that.

4440
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:08,163
You put out,

4441
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:09,210
are you going to tell her?

4442
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:10,570
She knows.

4443
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:11,403
She knows.

4444
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:13,090
You know what I'm doing right now.

4445
01:51:13,091 --> 01:51:15,220
I'm writing to see if I'm
any good at this part.

4446
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,320
Right in the gang in new
you totally would be good.

4447
01:51:17,321 --> 01:51:21,010
That's what I was saying before and she
told me to do a podcast because I don't

4448
01:51:21,011 --> 01:51:21,340
like,

4449
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:21,980
I'm not going to be,

4450
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:22,661
that's good.

4451
01:51:22,661 --> 01:51:23,230
That's good.

4452
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:24,100
That's even better.

4453
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:25,300
That's even more fun.

4454
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:26,920
But I don't want to just shred people.

4455
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:27,611
You don't have to.

4456
01:51:27,611 --> 01:51:29,680
I'll have a podcast for three weeks.

4457
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:31,120
I don't want to be on there.

4458
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:31,901
When you and I talk,

4459
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:32,770
we don't shred each other.

4460
01:51:32,771 --> 01:51:34,060
You know each other.

4461
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:34,240
Yeah.

4462
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:37,800
But I'm saying it wouldn't automatically
be you not liking the people years

4463
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:41,740
assuming that I don't think it's necessary
because I don't get along with a lot

4464
01:51:41,741 --> 01:51:42,330
of,

4465
01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:45,130
and that's in real life on stage.

4466
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:45,671
Well,

4467
01:51:45,671 --> 01:51:49,510
you and I have always gotten along and I
think it had a big part of it had to be

4468
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:51,670
that I was a huge fan when I was a kid.

4469
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:52,600
I remember I was having,

4470
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:55,180
but it's like you brought up last
time about the first time we talked,

4471
01:51:55,181 --> 01:51:59,950
because you know I was starting to know
your history a little with the TV show

4472
01:51:59,951 --> 01:52:02,710
and stuff and that's why it
spoke to you about the road.

4473
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:03,370
You know,

4474
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:03,881
I was like,

4475
01:52:03,881 --> 01:52:04,930
you don't go on the road,

4476
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:07,010
you have a sitcom on the Yale.

4477
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:08,200
Like what are you waiting for?

4478
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:09,070
You know?

4479
01:52:09,070 --> 01:52:09,820
And that's,

4480
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,950
I think that's when you really
started going out there.

4481
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:12,431
Yeah,

4482
01:52:12,431 --> 01:52:12,971
it was really good.

4483
01:52:12,971 --> 01:52:13,781
What's my cost to me.

4484
01:52:13,781 --> 01:52:14,920
But it was natural.

4485
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:17,380
It was very good advice and
I didn't even think about it.

4486
01:52:17,381 --> 01:52:20,290
And also I was just assuming that
I would always have a sitcom role,

4487
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:23,370
which is really dumb because like
why would you assume that the end he,

4488
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:24,490
those things never last.

4489
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:24,821
You know?

4490
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:26,340
And it lasted for five fires,

4491
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:27,250
but,

4492
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:28,930
but once I started going on the road,

4493
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,870
that's when my standup
really got a lot better.

4494
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,240
That's the one thing I could tell with
you when you were on stage as you love

4495
01:52:34,241 --> 01:52:34,450
it.

4496
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:34,691
See,

4497
01:52:34,691 --> 01:52:35,381
that's the key.

4498
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:36,940
And you never lost that love for it.

4499
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:39,160
It's the most fun thing about the special.

4500
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:39,491
No,

4501
01:52:39,491 --> 01:52:40,060
it's fun.

4502
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:40,893
It's still fun.

4503
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:41,620
It's too fun.

4504
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:41,720
Oh,

4505
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:44,710
you're going to tour a lot now with them
trying to write a lot of new shit right

4506
01:52:44,711 --> 01:52:45,080
now.

4507
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:49,160
So I've got to at least 40 new minutes
of new stuff and then a gang of stuff in

4508
01:52:49,161 --> 01:52:52,790
the notebook that I have to
sit and write it go on stage.

4509
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:53,683
I do both.

4510
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:55,550
I do a lot of making up on stage.

4511
01:52:55,630 --> 01:52:56,850
A lot of shit like I'll go on to,

4512
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:58,130
you don't have an idea,

4513
01:52:58,180 --> 01:52:58,730
you know?

4514
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:01,250
But there's a lot of it that I
actually sit in front of a computer.

4515
01:53:01,251 --> 01:53:01,491
Right.

4516
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:03,620
I think to get the best results.

4517
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:04,670
I like both.

4518
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,440
I like actual writing,

4519
01:53:06,441 --> 01:53:06,951
sitting down,

4520
01:53:06,951 --> 01:53:10,050
writing things out and then
I like performing and living.

4521
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:13,820
I just think that when
you take a lot of time,

4522
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:15,170
when you sit in front of a computer,

4523
01:53:15,171 --> 01:53:16,190
taking a lot of time,

4524
01:53:16,191 --> 01:53:18,890
you're going to come up with more
possibilities than you will in the moment.

4525
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:19,431
You know?

4526
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:21,080
Like in the moment is great too.

4527
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:25,040
But I think it's done an eave or
even an either or thing rather.

4528
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:26,210
I think for Comedians,

4529
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:28,220
I think it's important to both,

4530
01:53:28,221 --> 01:53:28,760
right?

4531
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,530
Like to sit down and actually work on
your shit by yourself and to do it on

4532
01:53:33,531 --> 01:53:35,210
stage and just ad Lib and fuck around.

4533
01:53:35,211 --> 01:53:36,740
That's how I have the best results.

4534
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:37,723
That's always tail.

4535
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:38,601
Like young guys,

4536
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:38,841
they say,

4537
01:53:38,841 --> 01:53:40,520
what should I like to write on stage?

4538
01:53:40,521 --> 01:53:40,790
I'm like,

4539
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:41,541
keep doing that.

4540
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:42,740
Definitely keep writing on stage.

4541
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:44,450
But you should also write,

4542
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:47,670
you should also sit down and write
because you get the most out of it.

4543
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:50,120
I only do it on stage,

4544
01:53:50,170 --> 01:53:51,050
only on square rock.

4545
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:52,360
I'll come up with stuff.

4546
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,140
Not that I'm a genius with it,

4547
01:53:54,141 --> 01:53:54,351
you know,

4548
01:53:54,351 --> 01:53:55,580
it doesn't happen every night.

4549
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:58,340
So you have you ever sit down
with like a notebook or anything?

4550
01:54:00,190 --> 01:54:02,240
And what I love is,

4551
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:02,650
you know,

4552
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:02,840
uh,

4553
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,160
you know that I finally,

4554
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:04,670
you know,

4555
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,960
to give her a little credit,

4556
01:54:06,050 --> 01:54:07,610
she doesn't want to be
on the air or anything,

4557
01:54:07,611 --> 01:54:10,370
but she'll tail it the bit.

4558
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:13,850
Like if I come up with something
and it goes a little too long,

4559
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,830
she'll explain why it's got to be,

4560
01:54:15,831 --> 01:54:16,910
she really gets it,

4561
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:17,661
you know,

4562
01:54:17,661 --> 01:54:21,020
and I'll show it in the bid up and
I'll be on stage and I'll kill with it.

4563
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:21,980
I'll be like,

4564
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:23,510
how the fuck does she know?

4565
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:24,650
You know,

4566
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:25,121
cause she,

4567
01:54:25,121 --> 01:54:26,900
she wants anything but the limelight,

4568
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:28,041
you know what I mean?

4569
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:29,840
And it's like she just gets it,

4570
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:30,291
you know,

4571
01:54:30,291 --> 01:54:30,950
she'll go,

4572
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:31,760
you don't understand.

4573
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:34,410
Once you hit this point you
don't have to go farther with,

4574
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:35,091
that's it.

4575
01:54:35,091 --> 01:54:36,710
That's the Joe and that they're,

4576
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:37,491
you know,

4577
01:54:37,491 --> 01:54:40,430
and because of a Latin
background it's like all right,

4578
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:41,360
I'll end it there.

4579
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:42,890
But she's normally right.

4580
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:45,230
99% of the time it'll be killer.

4581
01:54:45,410 --> 01:54:46,850
It's a funny thing with stand up comedy,

4582
01:54:46,851 --> 01:54:47,980
like you know,

4583
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:51,710
you never know like where the bits going
to go when you first started and you

4584
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:53,420
start adding on to it.

4585
01:54:53,421 --> 01:54:58,421
And my attitude like I would never listen
to anybody about what I do on stage,

4586
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:03,050
especially in non comic
and she's not a comedian.

4587
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:03,801
You know,

4588
01:55:03,801 --> 01:55:04,371
it would be like,

4589
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:04,671
look,

4590
01:55:04,671 --> 01:55:05,690
when I'm on stage,

4591
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:06,381
do me a favor,

4592
01:55:06,381 --> 01:55:07,280
stay out of it.

4593
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:08,030
You know,

4594
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:11,840
I didn't become who I am because
I was listening to my girlfriends,

4595
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:12,861
you know what I mean?

4596
01:55:12,861 --> 01:55:17,861
But she really gets it and every time
she comes up with something and I do it,

4597
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:18,860
it kills.

4598
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:23,450
I know a lot of comics like
to work with the people.

4599
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,560
They like to like a,

4600
01:55:24,561 --> 01:55:25,520
I know like Chris Rock,

4601
01:55:25,521 --> 01:55:26,510
when he would do a special,

4602
01:55:26,511 --> 01:55:28,280
he would work with a team of guys,

4603
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:29,813
Dawson,

4604
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:32,770
Nick Depalo and they would come
up with the bits and you know,

4605
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:33,680
work on it together.

4606
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:34,610
The Palos,

4607
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:35,370
a good comic.

4608
01:55:35,370 --> 01:55:36,080
Yeah.

4609
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:36,571
But I don't,

4610
01:55:36,571 --> 01:55:37,910
I don't think any comic,

4611
01:55:37,911 --> 01:55:39,080
that's a really great car.

4612
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:40,370
And I think the polyps great.

4613
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:41,413
Yeah.

4614
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:44,010
But I don't think he's going to
look to write better rock than he

4615
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,210
has for somebody else.

4616
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:46,170
It's true.

4617
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:47,340
It's just in your head.

4618
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,353
You're not going to,

4619
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,420
if you come up with
something fantastic way,

4620
01:55:50,421 --> 01:55:51,254
the writing,

4621
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:51,931
you know what,

4622
01:55:51,931 --> 01:55:54,950
I'm going to put this on the side for me.

4623
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:56,123
I'll give credit.

4624
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:58,350
That's why I also believe
in being an original.

4625
01:55:58,380 --> 01:55:59,550
Like you know,

4626
01:55:59,551 --> 01:56:00,660
it comes from you.

4627
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:00,960
Yeah.

4628
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,010
I think that's important.

4629
01:56:02,011 --> 01:56:02,251
You know,

4630
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:05,760
when I hear that a guy had a bunch of
writers helping with Watson of special,

4631
01:56:05,761 --> 01:56:06,594
it's just,

4632
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:08,850
you know,

4633
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:10,160
with them and see it thing when,

4634
01:56:10,161 --> 01:56:10,891
when he was stealing it,

4635
01:56:10,891 --> 01:56:13,440
you know that guy was stealing material.

4636
01:56:13,441 --> 01:56:15,720
But I'm talking about when
others are writing at field.

4637
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:18,990
It's like how it doesn't
feel organic coming doesn't,

4638
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:19,740
but I don't care.

4639
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,580
That doesn't bother me.

4640
01:56:20,581 --> 01:56:24,090
I don't think that a musician should
have to sing his own songs that he wrote.

4641
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,920
I don't think that a
comic should have to tell.

4642
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:27,710
I think if one of your
friends right to joke for you,

4643
01:56:27,711 --> 01:56:30,840
you should be able to do it on stage and
it feels actually comes up with great

4644
01:56:30,841 --> 01:56:31,500
stuff for me.

4645
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,100
It doesn't really.

4646
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:32,570
Yeah.

4647
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:33,750
And there's nothing wrong with dad,

4648
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:34,420
but I,

4649
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:39,420
but I feel like he knows me so well if
I'm doing like a bit on the heavy box,

4650
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:42,173
you know what I mean?

4651
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:42,961
You know,

4652
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:45,420
first you know the bull monkey,

4653
01:56:45,421 --> 01:56:47,250
whatever the fuck they want it today.

4654
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:48,503
You know,

4655
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,110
like I'll just call him up and I'll
start coming up with stuff and he'll just

4656
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:53,310
add these things and I go,

4657
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,290
why don't you do that for you?

4658
01:56:55,670 --> 01:56:56,503
Right.

4659
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:59,070
Cause he's such a peculiar character.

4660
01:56:59,280 --> 01:56:59,760
He's a very,

4661
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,610
definitely when it comes
up with something for me,

4662
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:03,781
you know,

4663
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:06,150
I'll just like do it and kill with it.

4664
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,013
It could just be,

4665
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:10,080
well he did get me banned
from one TV show here.

4666
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:10,950
Wheels did.

4667
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:12,150
Cause I listened to him.

4668
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,470
There's something wrong with me.

4669
01:57:13,471 --> 01:57:14,304
Like heels,

4670
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,330
wheels tried to tell me that.

4671
01:57:15,331 --> 01:57:16,280
It was like a cool,

4672
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:18,383
you know what he's doing?

4673
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,790
He's got an entertainment company,

4674
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:22,320
blue light into Taman.

4675
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:24,190
He's got a catering company.

4676
01:57:24,191 --> 01:57:25,320
I heard his food's very good.

4677
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:26,250
It is.

4678
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:27,570
That's what's so nuts.

4679
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,890
Some of it at the comedy store,

4680
01:57:28,891 --> 01:57:30,270
way back Cagnoli kids,

4681
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,640
he'll love that I'm
saying this to you know,

4682
01:57:32,641 --> 01:57:33,440
but,

4683
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:34,273
but he really,

4684
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:34,690
like,

4685
01:57:34,690 --> 01:57:39,570
I went a couple of years ago and
I had to do another morning show,

4686
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:40,351
you know,

4687
01:57:40,351 --> 01:57:43,710
and I was getting heavy into the
technology stuff about the phones,

4688
01:57:43,711 --> 01:57:44,544
this and that.

4689
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:46,350
So as I'm driving there,

4690
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:47,101
he's talking to me.

4691
01:57:47,101 --> 01:57:47,934
He goes,

4692
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:52,530
all I want you to say if you bring up
technology is that you don't have a

4693
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:57,450
blackberry and the only thing you want
black is laying underneath you and it's

4694
01:57:57,451 --> 01:58:02,451
got a big fat ass and the only thing
you want buried is your face in it that

4695
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:03,870
your blackberry,

4696
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:05,183
you know.

4697
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:08,880
So I do it just the way
he tells me to do it.

4698
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:14,060
And you could feel the ass stop and it's
eight in the morning to Los Angeles.

4699
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,120
I'm going,

4700
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:15,610
yeah,

4701
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:17,220
I don't believe in the phone thing.

4702
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,030
You know,

4703
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:19,390
I don't like those blackberries.

4704
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:22,920
The only thing I want black is normally
underneath me with a big fat ass and the

4705
01:58:22,921 --> 01:58:23,701
only thing buried,

4706
01:58:23,701 --> 01:58:28,701
it's my face in it and then it's just
quiet in the studio and you felt it,

4707
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:31,140
you know?

4708
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:31,831
And you know,

4709
01:58:31,831 --> 01:58:35,790
of course my publicist was told he
could never be on the show again.

4710
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:39,210
Does that's even nobody the fuck did
they think they were going to get if

4711
01:58:39,211 --> 01:58:41,410
they're bringing it Clarius.

4712
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:44,570
But I was just so into
the joke driving there,

4713
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:45,380
Dan,

4714
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:46,820
I didn't think it was that bad.

4715
01:58:46,821 --> 01:58:47,271
I'm going,

4716
01:58:47,271 --> 01:58:48,440
well I'm not cursing.

4717
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:49,993
You know,

4718
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:50,811
and they yeah,

4719
01:58:50,811 --> 01:58:51,380
it's not that.

4720
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:52,213
No it's you,

4721
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:56,810
it's Andrew dice clay at eight in the
morning when when people are shaving and

4722
01:58:56,811 --> 01:58:58,130
getting ready for work,

4723
01:58:58,670 --> 01:58:59,503
you know,

4724
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:03,500
as a black woman on screen
with me right next to me,

4725
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:04,663
they're looking like,

4726
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:05,960
what the fuck is this?

4727
01:59:05,961 --> 01:59:06,794
So,

4728
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,180
so today when I did this other,

4729
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,560
you know,

4730
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,400
Fox News,

4731
01:59:10,401 --> 01:59:11,030
I,

4732
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:12,140
I was nice.

4733
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:15,920
You worry about them a sabotaging
you or sending you up or you know,

4734
01:59:15,921 --> 01:59:17,240
like ready to,

4735
01:59:17,241 --> 01:59:17,481
you know,

4736
01:59:17,481 --> 01:59:19,700
those kinds of shows that
were always very cool with me.

4737
01:59:19,701 --> 01:59:24,200
So I always felt bad about the blackberry
joke cause I wasn't looking to offend

4738
01:59:24,201 --> 01:59:24,651
anybody.

4739
01:59:24,651 --> 01:59:25,880
I was just looking to be funny,

4740
01:59:26,370 --> 01:59:26,731
you know,

4741
01:59:26,731 --> 01:59:26,861
and,

4742
01:59:26,861 --> 01:59:28,100
and to me it was a funny Joe.

4743
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:29,870
They should and we'll show me to say it,

4744
01:59:29,871 --> 01:59:31,220
which they should ban him.

4745
01:59:31,310 --> 01:59:32,630
They should understand first of all,

4746
01:59:32,631 --> 01:59:34,400
that you're a dirty comedian.

4747
01:59:34,401 --> 01:59:35,890
You've always been putting shit up.

4748
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:36,800
Shocked by that.

4749
01:59:36,830 --> 01:59:41,510
But I'm also an adult that
shouldn't be listening to my friend,

4750
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:42,230
you know,

4751
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:45,130
telling me to do this joke
on the way Lou radio stuff.

4752
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:47,480
The TV station and seeing
it being your fault.

4753
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:48,560
I think people are too fucked.

4754
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:49,750
I think it's wheels fault.

4755
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,040
I think we could blame really
also if you would like,

4756
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,510
but he had read the plain,

4757
01:59:53,511 --> 01:59:54,270
the newspeople.

4758
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:56,030
I remember that time when you want CNN.

4759
01:59:56,210 --> 01:59:58,970
Well that guy had a comment
that was ridiculous,

4760
01:59:58,971 --> 01:59:59,720
but it was great.

4761
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:02,780
That was also a good viral
video for you because,

4762
02:00:02,781 --> 02:00:03,140
uh,

4763
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,730
people like it was clear,

4764
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:05,331
you know,

4765
02:00:05,331 --> 02:00:07,670
that it didn't make any sense of
this kind of saying that you like,

4766
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,680
you ran a gym for a while.

4767
02:00:09,681 --> 02:00:10,040
Well,

4768
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,180
I just did a,

4769
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:14,960
another CNN thing that'll layer
on a Saturday that actually,

4770
02:00:14,961 --> 02:00:15,560
uh,

4771
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:16,340
uh,

4772
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:18,390
Alan Duke was the interview.

4773
02:00:18,391 --> 02:00:18,590
Uh,

4774
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:20,390
and Tom Green produced it.

4775
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:21,531
Tom Green,

4776
02:00:21,531 --> 02:00:22,210
the comedian.

4777
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:22,660
Yeah.

4778
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:23,493
Oh yeah.

4779
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:24,583
He uh,

4780
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:25,460
he had,

4781
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:27,710
we did a two camera
shoot for this interview.

4782
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:28,071
Oh,

4783
02:00:28,071 --> 02:00:28,904
he's great.

4784
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:30,440
And I can't believe how it's him.

4785
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,711
You know,

4786
02:00:30,711 --> 02:00:30,921
me,

4787
02:00:30,921 --> 02:00:35,150
I'm always doing the filming and he's
holding this heavy cameras and he's,

4788
02:00:35,630 --> 02:00:37,910
he just becomes a filmmaker at that point.

4789
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:38,691
You know,

4790
02:00:38,691 --> 02:00:39,441
he's really great.

4791
02:00:39,441 --> 02:00:40,460
I'm good friends with Tom.

4792
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:41,340
I love triggering.

4793
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,050
He's phenomenal.

4794
02:00:42,050 --> 02:00:42,221
Phenomenal.

4795
02:00:42,221 --> 02:00:43,011
Got To get them back in here,

4796

4797

4798
02:00:44,890 --> 02:00:45,440

original interview with you?

4804
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:53,510
The one where you know,

4805
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,201
the dumb guy,

4806
02:00:54,201 --> 02:00:54,570
you know,

4807
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:57,410
the guy that interviewed me was
basically saying that guys like,

4808
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:57,860
you know,

4809
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:58,693
that was it.

4810
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:00,680
You know that guy made a mistake.

4811
02:01:00,681 --> 02:01:02,840
He paid the price and uh,

4812
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:07,900
that was it because he is a CNN
reporter that had no facts about it.

4813
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:09,580
That the dot.

4814
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:10,570
Here it is right here.

4815
02:01:10,570 --> 02:01:10,990
Yeah.

4816
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:12,140
That turned this on

4817
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:14,450
for a while.

4818
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:14,831
For a while.

4819
02:01:14,831 --> 02:01:15,664
You were actually,

4820
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:17,470
you were running a Jim,

4821
02:01:17,471 --> 02:01:18,221
tell us about that.

4822
02:01:18,221 --> 02:01:19,001
Hunting and Jim,

4823
02:01:19,001 --> 02:01:20,410
why don't you running a gym at some point?

4824
02:01:20,411 --> 02:01:21,101
Be a news guy.

4825
02:01:21,101 --> 02:01:22,330
What you get no fats are,

4826
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:23,243
we

4827
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:26,180
come on CNN and the,

4828
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:27,370
I don't even know what he's talking about.

4829
02:01:27,371 --> 02:01:27,790
Go ahead.

4830
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,290
You Ain't no point where
you're running a gym.

4831
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:30,191
No,

4832
02:01:30,191 --> 02:01:30,491
no.

4833
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:31,480
Running a gym.

4834
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:38,970
Jesus fucking Christ had come on the
news for two seconds and he wants,

4835
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:42,520
see every time I do an interview with
a guy wants to open his fucking man.

4836
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:43,551
All right Andrew.

4837
02:01:43,551 --> 02:01:44,384
A little thank you.

4838
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:46,933
Fuck yourself.

4839
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:49,950
Listen to the snow.

4840
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:52,610
Goes back to talking about art Carney

4841
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:57,100
fill.

4842
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:58,760
You went on the art Carney situation.

4843
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:00,433
Where did that go?

4844
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:00,870
That's

4845
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:01,703
it.

4846
02:02:01,810 --> 02:02:04,680
You know any Korea he
might've had is over.

4847
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:05,160
Yeah.

4848
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:08,940
How could you just ask someone and
say that your research shows the own?

4849
02:02:08,941 --> 02:02:09,151
Did you,

4850
02:02:09,151 --> 02:02:10,500
there was the Internet back then.

4851
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,700
What you want to know something?

4852
02:02:11,730 --> 02:02:16,380
What was crazy is and the guy knew it
that the next night I was at the beacon

4853
02:02:16,381 --> 02:02:17,840
theater and it was oversold.

4854
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:19,140
It was gone.

4855
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:21,480
Why was he trying to pretend that you,

4856
02:02:21,481 --> 02:02:21,920
uh,

4857
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:22,390
you know,

4858
02:02:22,390 --> 02:02:22,640
that,

4859
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:25,390
you know man away from stand
up and that you had weren't,

4860
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,950
weren't doing it and we're running a gym,

4861
02:02:26,951 --> 02:02:28,680
but why was he the way I would put it?

4862
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:29,820
I go his mom,

4863
02:02:29,821 --> 02:02:31,410
he probably didn't like me,

4864
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:32,191
you know,

4865
02:02:32,191 --> 02:02:35,460
so he was like going to get me
fuck this little cock sucker.

4866
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:37,350
Wonder whether they know he is right now.

4867
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:38,730
I'd like to touch point.

4868
02:02:38,731 --> 02:02:38,821
Oh,

4869
02:02:38,821 --> 02:02:39,331
here he is.

4870
02:02:39,331 --> 02:02:40,980
He's not delivering newspapers.

4871
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:41,813
That's where he is.

4872
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:45,690
I know for sure it'd be a real
good Taj point is that guy's name.

4873
02:02:45,691 --> 02:02:46,430
I don't even know his name.

4874
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:47,030
I know you are.

4875
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:48,090
Are you friends with Taj?

4876
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:49,493
I don't know him.

4877
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:50,363
I don't know.

4878
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:51,930
I watched the show with very good guy.

4879
02:02:51,931 --> 02:02:52,830
Very funny guy too.

4880
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:54,750
But that would be an interesting thing.

4881
02:02:54,751 --> 02:02:54,901
Yeah.

4882
02:02:54,901 --> 02:02:56,430
We're gonna need to
find out homeboy's name.

4883
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,960
W The internet will tell us,

4884
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:58,471
hey,

4885
02:02:58,471 --> 02:02:59,071
on Twitter,

4886
02:02:59,071 --> 02:03:02,010
who's that guy was that
fucking guy and where is he?

4887
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:03,400
All right.

4888
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:04,233
What's he doing?

4889
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:05,123
See if we can get them,

4890
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:05,700
look at it.

4891
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:06,870
Look how focused he is.

4892
02:03:06,930 --> 02:03:08,640
Maybe he would be a good guy to interview.

4893
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:08,970
Uh,

4894
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:09,803
and you could play that.

4895
02:03:10,650 --> 02:03:11,790
You have a son together.

4896
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:12,541
Yeah.

4897
02:03:12,541 --> 02:03:14,100
That would be too intimidating for them.

4898
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,900
Give a chance for him to apologize.

4899
02:03:16,050 --> 02:03:16,883
He wouldn't do it.

4900
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:17,813
He'd be sad.

4901
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:18,653
He'd be sad face.

4902
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:21,710
I forgot how many millions
of hits that though.

4903
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:22,553
I'm sure it did.

4904
02:03:22,630 --> 02:03:24,480
I watched it at least 20 you know,

4905
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:25,343
I love it.

4906
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:26,243
I love it.

4907
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:27,121
Yeah,

4908
02:03:27,121 --> 02:03:29,220
it was great because you know,

4909
02:03:29,221 --> 02:03:29,880
when you're doing,

4910
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:31,110
especially CNN,

4911
02:03:31,111 --> 02:03:31,620
which is,

4912
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:32,453
you know,

4913
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:35,310
is aren't they the top
news show in the world?

4914
02:03:35,610 --> 02:03:36,990
How don't you have some facts,

4915
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:37,620
right?

4916
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:37,891
I mean,

4917
02:03:37,891 --> 02:03:38,111
you,

4918
02:03:38,111 --> 02:03:41,400
you have way more facts
than this guy have a head,

4919
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:42,121
you know,

4920
02:03:42,121 --> 02:03:42,960
and you're a comedian.

4921
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:43,171
Well,

4922
02:03:43,171 --> 02:03:43,471
he was,

4923
02:03:43,471 --> 02:03:46,980
what he was doing was just
sort of judging you as a joke,

4924
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:47,580
you know,

4925
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:47,971
he was like,

4926
02:03:47,971 --> 02:03:48,181
well,

4927
02:03:48,181 --> 02:03:50,090
I'm hearing or doing
an interview with some,

4928
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:50,881
you know,

4929
02:03:50,881 --> 02:03:52,410
like his thing paid the price.

4930
02:03:52,411 --> 02:03:53,560
It wasn't that he,

4931
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:56,370
he was diminishing or you,

4932
02:03:58,450 --> 02:03:59,283
you,

4933
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:00,330
you were,

4934
02:04:00,330 --> 02:04:01,770
you were a headline guy,

4935
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:04,440
line guy for a while.

4936
02:04:04,441 --> 02:04:07,120
You popped out and now you're
coming back for a while.

4937
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:07,591
For a while.

4938
02:04:07,591 --> 02:04:08,424
You were actually,

4939
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:09,721
you were running.

4940
02:04:09,721 --> 02:04:10,230
And Sam,

4941
02:04:10,230 --> 02:04:11,150
tell us about that.

4942
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,760
That I never understood running a gym.

4943
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:19,170
Everybody wants to think that just you
have to have all of your information.

4944
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:22,230
You have to have all your ducks in
a row and your facts check to be on

4945
02:04:22,231 --> 02:04:22,691
television.

4946
02:04:22,691 --> 02:04:23,850
And that's just not the case.

4947
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:26,850
Like you could get on one of those shows
and never dickless opinions and then

4948
02:04:26,851 --> 02:04:27,760
they fucking fire you.

4949
02:04:27,761 --> 02:04:27,931
I mean,

4950
02:04:27,931 --> 02:04:31,590
it's happened a million times
before this guy really paid.

4951
02:04:31,591 --> 02:04:34,200
I think he disappeared,

4952
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:36,180
but he probably sucked anyway.

4953
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:36,990
I mean that,

4954
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:38,310
that was a shitty interview.

4955
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:39,770
Like why would he talk to you like that?

4956
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:45,000
Because he's an asshole because he
didn't do any fact checking because,

4957
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,590
because like I said,

4958
02:04:46,591 --> 02:04:46,801
he,

4959
02:04:46,801 --> 02:04:50,230
you could tell this isn't a guy
that would be into two days also.

4960
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:51,570
But even if you're not,

4961
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:53,610
don't these guys talk to everybody?

4962
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:54,471
Yeah,

4963
02:04:54,471 --> 02:04:55,304
he has a,

4964
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:56,331
it's that fake.

4965
02:04:56,331 --> 02:04:57,164
We're talking,

4966
02:04:57,350 --> 02:04:57,561
you know,

4967
02:04:57,561 --> 02:04:59,990
that sort of fake on
television way of talking.

4968
02:05:00,070 --> 02:05:00,270
Oh,

4969
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:04,330
when he came out and I could tell
something was up because you know,

4970
02:05:04,331 --> 02:05:05,081
I was trying to like,

4971
02:05:05,081 --> 02:05:05,381
you know,

4972
02:05:05,381 --> 02:05:06,300
a little pre,

4973
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:07,390
not a pre interview,

4974
02:05:07,391 --> 02:05:10,260
but you know how you doing what's
called before you sit down and talk.

4975
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:12,100
And he was like ignoring me,

4976
02:05:12,790 --> 02:05:13,240
you know?

4977
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:14,980
And I was actually there with,

4978
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,930
with Eleanor and happy face.

4979
02:05:17,170 --> 02:05:19,090
He was ignoring you because
he didn't want to talk to you.

4980
02:05:19,091 --> 02:05:19,840
And I could just,

4981
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:20,673
I can just fit.

4982
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:20,861
No,

4983
02:05:20,861 --> 02:05:22,210
there were no cameras on us.

4984
02:05:22,290 --> 02:05:22,760
But what,

4985
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,670
he didn't want to talk to you
until the camera's on maybe.

4986
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:25,870
Yeah.

4987
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:26,160
Like,

4988
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:26,981
like how don't you,

4989
02:05:26,981 --> 02:05:29,770
even when you do a talk show that
come over to you for a few minutes,

4990
02:05:29,771 --> 02:05:31,540
you know the host before you go on,

4991
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:33,460
this guy didn't even want to talk.

4992
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:34,893
And um,

4993
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:36,091
I wish,

4994
02:05:36,091 --> 02:05:38,410
I don't know what was here to
tell the story because when,

4995
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:42,030
when you're sitting there
doing the interview behind you,

4996
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:42,680
you know,

4997
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:47,680
it's in New York and it's just the full
floor of people with computers on the

4998
02:05:48,311 --> 02:05:49,144
desk.

4999
02:05:49,450 --> 02:05:52,870
So Eleanor said when you first cursed,

5000
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:54,071
she goes,

5001
02:05:54,071 --> 02:05:57,940
you're talking about a couple hundred
people on this floor with computers.

5002
02:05:58,540 --> 02:05:59,650
Everything stopped.

5003
02:05:59,710 --> 02:06:03,910
And they all just looked up at the
computer and then it continued.

5004
02:06:04,150 --> 02:06:07,300
And then everybody like
lean forward to go,

5005
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:09,820
is this really airing right now?

5006
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:14,680
Like they couldn't believe it was airing
and then we just like ran out of there

5007
02:06:14,681 --> 02:06:15,580
and gotten a cab.

5008
02:06:15,581 --> 02:06:16,360
Like we were like,

5009
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:17,830
we just robbed the bank.

5010
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:18,311
Well,

5011
02:06:18,311 --> 02:06:20,980
CNN is not broadcast television,

5012
02:06:21,070 --> 02:06:26,070
so CNN is not held to the
same restrictions that the
FCC imposes on NBC or CBS

5013
02:06:26,501 --> 02:06:27,334
or ABC.

5014
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:28,450
That's not a cable.

5015
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:30,010
So when you're on cable you can say,

5016
02:06:30,011 --> 02:06:30,370
Shit,

5017
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:31,450
we can say whatever you want.

5018
02:06:31,451 --> 02:06:35,380
It's up to whether or not your advertisers
are willing to still support you

5019
02:06:35,381 --> 02:06:36,130
while you do that.

5020
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:37,510
So you aren't breaking any laws.

5021
02:06:37,511 --> 02:06:40,480
But if you had done that on like ABC
Nightline news or something like that,

5022
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:43,420
then you would have broken
a law and then then shit.

5023
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:45,880
If they've found you like
that you did it willingly.

5024
02:06:45,881 --> 02:06:46,960
Me You'd slip up.

5025
02:06:46,961 --> 02:06:47,290
I,

5026
02:06:47,290 --> 02:06:48,070
I just fucking got,

5027
02:06:48,070 --> 02:06:48,820
oh sorry.

5028
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:52,090
You know you could have one of those
situations but if you clearly like like

5029
02:06:52,091 --> 02:06:57,091
this fucking asshole over here and you
know clearly like that today I think is

5030
02:06:57,701 --> 02:06:59,140
like that's a serious fine.

5031
02:06:59,141 --> 02:07:01,940
I think that's like a quarter million
dollars and I think you can to the person

5032
02:07:01,941 --> 02:07:02,440
saying,

5033
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:02,741
yeah,

5034
02:07:02,741 --> 02:07:03,750
you can get in a lot of trauma.

5035
02:07:04,070 --> 02:07:05,020
I got to remember that.

5036
02:07:05,510 --> 02:07:07,660
But the way you did it on a CNN,

5037
02:07:08,230 --> 02:07:09,041
on heater,

5038
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:09,790
our net,

5039
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:10,780
I believe that's his name.

5040
02:07:11,110 --> 02:07:12,550
When you did it on CNN though.

5041
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:13,180
That was,

5042
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:13,601
it was like,

5043
02:07:13,601 --> 02:07:14,560
just do one on Hbo.

5044
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:15,490
It's like the same thing.

5045
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:16,080
Really.

5046
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:18,130
This guy probably just
sits there all day and go,

5047
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:20,050
everybody has seen this.

5048
02:07:20,850 --> 02:07:24,250
Just everybody has seen another
half a million are going to say it.

5049
02:07:24,251 --> 02:07:25,890
Now look,

5050
02:07:26,210 --> 02:07:26,861
it's silly.

5051
02:07:26,861 --> 02:07:27,250
Fox.

5052
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:28,150
The road can pot.

5053
02:07:28,210 --> 02:07:30,190
It's very funny when you
have a guy like that.

5054
02:07:30,191 --> 02:07:30,730
Those guys,

5055
02:07:30,730 --> 02:07:31,301
they kill me.

5056
02:07:31,301 --> 02:07:32,890
Those buttoned up guys.

5057
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:34,563
That's not him.

5058
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:35,980
That is not the

5059
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,670
guy.

5060
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:38,020
That's what he turned into with

5061
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:41,170
gained 150 pounds,

5062
02:07:41,990 --> 02:07:44,730
started a slumping fucking jerk off.

5063
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,110
He's still a jerk off for doing that.

5064
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:47,951
Well,

5065
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:49,510
maybe he feels bad and he's not anymore.

5066
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:50,523
No,

5067
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:51,393
never forget.

5068
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:51,911
Never Forget.

5069
02:07:51,911 --> 02:07:52,990
It feels bad.

5070
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:54,840
Probably not.

5071
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,530
Gretz is that that happened?

5072
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:57,433
That's all.

5073
02:07:57,730 --> 02:07:58,330
Yeah.

5074
02:07:58,330 --> 02:07:59,220
Well am I see evolve.

5075
02:07:59,230 --> 02:08:02,980
Maybe when a mushroom trip somewhere
maybe we went down to Peru cause brain

5076
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:03,814
cleaned out.

5077
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:04,953
It's possible.

5078
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:05,990
I don't like him.

5079
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:06,581
I don't want to,

5080
02:08:06,581 --> 02:08:07,690
I don't want to get a fine.

5081
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:08,613
No,

5082
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:11,620
you don't get to find on the Internet
you that you can do whatever the fuck you

5083
02:08:11,621 --> 02:08:11,980
want.

5084
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,360
That's why I love this show.

5085
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:17,290
It's so relaxed to you if you're
having a good time here so far.

5086
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:18,933
Yeah.

5087
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:20,230
Mrs Dice Clay,

5088
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:22,560
Mrs dice climb in the back
of his uncle on the air.

5089
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:23,111
Yeah.

5090
02:08:23,111 --> 02:08:24,740
It's cool that you guys uh,

5091
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:27,370
have this like happy touring thing too.

5092
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:29,860
Like you guys are happy together
in Vegas having a good time.

5093
02:08:29,861 --> 02:08:31,060
Like you bring your family out,

5094
02:08:31,061 --> 02:08:32,260
you have your kids open for you,

5095
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:32,831
Ellen noise,

5096
02:08:32,831 --> 02:08:33,664
your friend.

5097
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:34,211
She's there.

5098
02:08:34,211 --> 02:08:37,150
Like you have like a
nice happy little group.

5099
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:37,511
Yeah,

5100
02:08:37,511 --> 02:08:38,081
it's Nice,

5101
02:08:38,081 --> 02:08:38,351
you know,

5102
02:08:38,351 --> 02:08:39,370
to sister wives,

5103
02:08:39,371 --> 02:08:40,150
the whole thing.

5104
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:43,150
I like how you did it in Vegas too
because I'd always wondered whether or not

5105
02:08:43,151 --> 02:08:44,410
somebody who even know what day it is.

5106
02:08:44,411 --> 02:08:45,430
Like a workout room.

5107
02:08:45,670 --> 02:08:45,941
No,

5108
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:46,780
I love that.

5109
02:08:46,781 --> 02:08:49,930
But now I'm actually moving
to the hard rock in Vegas and,

5110
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:50,440
well,

5111
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:51,273
yeah,

5112
02:08:51,310 --> 02:08:52,480
but what I meant was like,

5113
02:08:52,481 --> 02:08:55,210
I always wondered like
if you went to Vegas,

5114
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:58,480
like would you have to have the same act
over and over again or could you use,

5115
02:08:58,500 --> 02:08:59,680
you're the first guy that I heard of,

5116
02:08:59,681 --> 02:09:00,940
they like used Vegas,

5117
02:09:00,941 --> 02:09:01,451
like you said,

5118
02:09:01,451 --> 02:09:03,120
like the store just go in there,

5119
02:09:03,121 --> 02:09:04,360
but it's a tourist town.

5120
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,070
So every week you've got
a different audience,

5121
02:09:06,071 --> 02:09:07,150
different convention.

5122
02:09:07,930 --> 02:09:09,340
I don't know what you don't do it more.

5123
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:10,091
You were right.

5124
02:09:10,091 --> 02:09:10,570
I should,

5125
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:11,200
I probably should.

5126
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:12,610
So many comics are moving.

5127
02:09:12,611 --> 02:09:13,750
They're living there,

5128
02:09:13,751 --> 02:09:14,440
you know.

5129
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:14,561
Well,

5130
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:15,700
I'm doing it in February.

5131
02:09:15,701 --> 02:09:16,421
I'm a,

5132
02:09:16,421 --> 02:09:18,820
I'm at the Mandalay Bay,

5133
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:19,720
the big room,

5134
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:20,500
uh,

5135
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:20,940
on,

5136
02:09:20,940 --> 02:09:21,220
uh,

5137
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,870
February 1st,

5138
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,460
and it's the day before the UFC.

5139
02:09:24,461 --> 02:09:25,360
It's basically the same.

5140
02:09:25,361 --> 02:09:26,440
They kind of liked that.

5141
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,460
I've done that room toe.

5142
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:28,060
It's where it,

5143
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:28,241
yeah,

5144
02:09:28,241 --> 02:09:29,680
but I can't sell that many tickets.

5145
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:30,210
So they,

5146
02:09:30,210 --> 02:09:34,220
they cut it in half and then
even cut in half is 802,

5147
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:34,670
you know,

5148
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:35,830
it's 800 seats cut.

5149
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:36,611
I know the room.

5150
02:09:36,611 --> 02:09:37,600
I've done it a lot.

5151
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:38,141
No,

5152
02:09:38,141 --> 02:09:38,974
it's one that,

5153
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:39,500
no,

5154
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:43,030
the room is like 1600 16,000 you mean?

5155
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:43,670
No,

5156
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:45,820
which one I'm talking
about in the Mandalay Bay,

5157
02:09:45,821 --> 02:09:46,810
they got a big showroom.

5158
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:47,321
Oh,

5159
02:09:47,321 --> 02:09:47,501
no,

5160
02:09:47,501 --> 02:09:47,561
no,

5161
02:09:47,561 --> 02:09:47,641
no,

5162
02:09:47,641 --> 02:09:47,800
no,

5163
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,011
no.

5164
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:50,740
They're doing it in the event
center where the fights,

5165
02:09:50,830 --> 02:09:51,730
it's where they have the fight.

5166
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:51,851
Oh,

5167
02:09:51,851 --> 02:09:52,840
you're doing it now.

5168
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:55,810
They cut off half the room to do the way
it's actually not even half the room.

5169
02:09:55,811 --> 02:09:57,040
It's more like a third of the room,

5170
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,193
so

5171
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:02,770
I think it's like close to 4,000 yeah.

5172
02:10:02,771 --> 02:10:03,740
But you know,

5173
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:05,800
you get a tremendous following.

5174
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:06,480
Yeah.

5175
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:06,630
No,

5176
02:10:06,630 --> 02:10:06,741
no,

5177
02:10:06,741 --> 02:10:06,941
no.

5178
02:10:06,941 --> 02:10:07,140
It's,

5179
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:07,410
it's,

5180
02:10:07,410 --> 02:10:08,171
it's a great place.

5181
02:10:08,171 --> 02:10:09,820
But I'm saying that
that's what I usually do.

5182
02:10:09,821 --> 02:10:10,480
I only do like,

5183
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:11,530
what would you be happy now?

5184

1,000 people showing up for you?

5185
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:13,520
Yeah,

5186
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:14,410
we've done that before.

5187
02:10:14,670 --> 02:10:15,700
I've done that a couple of times.

5188
02:10:16,030 --> 02:10:16,720
Yeah,

5189
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:17,553
that'd be great.

5190
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:18,753
Yeah.

5191
02:10:19,930 --> 02:10:21,130

the end of the Mayan calendar show.

02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:19,671
And uh,

It was really fun.

5240
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:24,770
It's pretty crazy.

5241
02:11:25,190 --> 02:11:26,001
That's a good show.

5242
02:11:26,001 --> 02:11:26,480
So yeah,

5243
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,050
it was fun.

5244
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:27,321
Yeah,

5245
02:11:27,321 --> 02:11:28,020

Honey,

5249

they're friends of ours.

5250
02:11:31,161 --> 02:11:32,630
They'd been in the Holocaust a few times.

5251
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:32,931
Really,

5252
02:11:32,931 --> 02:11:34,010
really talented band.

5253
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:37,940
They're like almost like kind of
countryish kinda like rockish country.

5254
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:39,980
Like they play a lot of Banjos and shit.

5255
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:41,390
The girl has a tremendous voice,

5256
02:11:41,391 --> 02:11:41,661
guys,

5257
02:11:41,661 --> 02:11:42,640
a great songwriter,

5258
02:11:42,650 --> 02:11:43,371
great musician,

5259
02:11:43,371 --> 02:11:44,420
really cool people too.

5260
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:45,980
So they opened up the show.

5261
02:11:45,981 --> 02:11:46,814
They did like four,

5262
02:11:46,850 --> 02:11:47,490
four songs.

5263
02:11:47,490 --> 02:11:49,700
Then Diaz went out and
like he's doing great.

5264
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:50,240
Ah.

5265
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:51,050
Couldn't be doing better.

5266
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:51,380
Yeah.

5267
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:52,460
He's killing him everywhere.

5268
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:53,750
He didn't want a podcast though,

5269
02:11:53,751 --> 02:11:54,230
right?

5270
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:54,640
Oh yeah.

5271
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:55,850
Church of what's happening now.

5272
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:57,320
But he's also,

5273
02:11:57,321 --> 02:12:00,410
I think he might even be there
now where I play at the river.

5274
02:12:00,970 --> 02:12:01,200
Ah,

5275
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:01,521
stall.

5276
02:12:01,521 --> 02:12:02,354
Like the,

5277
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,430
they're talking to him
about doing something.

5278
02:12:04,431 --> 02:12:07,490
I don't know whether or not he's decided
whether or not he was going to do it.

5279
02:12:07,491 --> 02:12:09,890
I think he was trying to make up his mind
whether or not he was going to do that

5280
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:10,490
or not.

5281
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,240
But um,

5282
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:13,910
I think it's a great idea for
him because it's a quick flight,

5283
02:12:13,911 --> 02:12:15,470
40 minute flight lives in Burbank.

5284
02:12:15,490 --> 02:12:15,840
It's,

5285
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:16,430
you know what,

5286
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:19,750
it's the best gig right now
in the country for comic.

5287
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:20,150
You,

5288
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:20,451
you know,

5289
02:12:20,451 --> 02:12:22,010
you make it sound very appealing.

5290
02:12:22,011 --> 02:12:22,430
I just,

5291
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:24,620
the idea of like living in Vegas,

5292
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:26,350
but you don't have to live there,

5293
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:27,201
you know,

5294
02:12:27,201 --> 02:12:28,310
you could just go,

5295
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:29,930
you just want to see,

5296
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:31,130
we drive it all the time.

5297
02:12:31,131 --> 02:12:31,970
We don't even fly.

5298
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:32,610
Yeah.

5299
02:12:32,610 --> 02:12:32,880
Yeah.

5300
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:33,680
We'll drive it,

5301
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,011
you know,

5302
02:12:34,011 --> 02:12:37,520
and it's become so regular dry for us.

5303
02:12:37,521 --> 02:12:38,960
It doesn't feel like a long time.

5304
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:39,261
You know,

5305
02:12:39,261 --> 02:12:40,700
we do it in four hours.

5306
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:41,780
That's the best tip.

5307
02:12:41,781 --> 02:12:42,950
Like what's the best time to go?

5308
02:12:42,951 --> 02:12:45,380
Do you have any tips to drive
when you drive in there?

5309
02:12:45,730 --> 02:12:49,370
But anywhere between 12 and one I am

5310
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:51,733
in the morning,

5311
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:53,631
in the afternoon.

5312
02:12:53,631 --> 02:12:54,464
You fuck afternoon,

5313
02:12:54,930 --> 02:12:55,850
get it wrong twice.

5314
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:58,050
If I'm home at night a lot,

5315
02:12:58,330 --> 02:12:58,790
you know,

5316
02:12:58,790 --> 02:13:01,730
we'll get home like five in the morning
and getting stuck on that drives.

5317
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:03,590
I've been stuck on that drive.

5318
02:13:03,591 --> 02:13:04,110
I stopped.

5319
02:13:04,110 --> 02:13:04,281
No,

5320
02:13:04,281 --> 02:13:06,350
but I could go away when everybody's,

5321
02:13:06,370 --> 02:13:06,690
you know,

5322
02:13:06,690 --> 02:13:07,523
at work.

5323
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:08,241
So,

5324
02:13:08,241 --> 02:13:08,690
um,

5325
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:09,260
the,

5326
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:10,580
going to the hard rock that,

5327
02:13:10,581 --> 02:13:11,030
um,

5328
02:13:11,030 --> 02:13:12,290
is it in the new wing?

5329
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:12,561
You know,

5330
02:13:12,561 --> 02:13:12,900
there's a,

5331
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:13,401
all those,

5332
02:13:13,401 --> 02:13:13,581
uh,

5333
02:13:13,581 --> 02:13:14,220
those new,

5334
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:14,420
no,

5335
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:14,630
no,

5336
02:13:14,630 --> 02:13:14,980
no.

5337
02:13:14,980 --> 02:13:15,700
It's weird.

5338
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:17,480
It's right near where the joint is.

5339
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:18,640
You know,

5340
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:18,921
it's,

5341
02:13:18,921 --> 02:13:20,300
it's when you first come in,

5342
02:13:20,301 --> 02:13:21,230
like you go to your right,

5343
02:13:21,231 --> 02:13:22,190
it's right in that area.

5344
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:23,031
I know exactly where it is.

5345
02:13:23,031 --> 02:13:24,950
I said there was a band
there when I was there.

5346
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:25,401
Yeah.

5347
02:13:25,401 --> 02:13:26,480
Well that room,

5348
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:29,470
the vinyl is,

5349
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:32,220
is a rock and roll room
where they put like new

5350
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:32,881
rock bands.

5351
02:13:32,881 --> 02:13:33,660
That's perfect view.

5352
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:34,190
How many seats,

5353
02:13:34,190 --> 02:13:34,620
you know,

5354
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:37,320
well it'll seat about 400
and you do that once a month,

5355
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:37,890
you know?

5356
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:38,101
Yeah,

5357
02:13:38,101 --> 02:13:40,260
I'll do it like two
weekends out of the month,

5358
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:40,501
you know,

5359
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:40,711
two,

5360
02:13:40,711 --> 02:13:41,970
four day weekends.

5361
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:44,700
So we spend like a week and a
half day and then we come home.

5362
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:46,590
I gotta start doing something like that.

5363
02:13:46,950 --> 02:13:50,370
I'm telling you is trying to do in
January 9th and trying to find a room for

5364
02:13:50,371 --> 02:13:50,851
AVN.

5365
02:13:50,851 --> 02:13:51,720
I went to a comedy show.

5366
02:13:51,721 --> 02:13:52,680
There was Sam Aaa,

5367
02:13:52,681 --> 02:13:53,514
but I have no idea.

5368
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:54,890
You could use a,

5369
02:13:54,890 --> 02:13:56,070
the laugh factory that,

5370
02:13:56,071 --> 02:13:56,320
uh,

5371
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:56,920
how bays,

5372
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:57,840
we'll just open the,

5373
02:13:57,990 --> 02:13:58,823
there's a last right,

5374
02:13:58,970 --> 02:14:00,720
right in the Tropicana really?

5375
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:06,230
Cause it Jamie massage connected
and it's the laugh factory and uh,

5376
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:07,321
how everything,

5377
02:14:07,321 --> 02:14:08,520
you know how everybody's all right?

5378
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:08,800
No,

5379
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:08,971
no,

5380
02:14:08,971 --> 02:14:09,460
he doesn't.

5381
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:10,800
And I have friends with Bazell tone.

5382
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:11,663
He's not.

5383
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,470
Do you know who he is?

5384
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:13,710
Yeah,

5385
02:14:13,710 --> 02:14:14,281
he's a calm.

5386
02:14:14,281 --> 02:14:17,430
I really don't know him actually
open for Rodney for like 20 years.

5387
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:18,271
And uh,

5388
02:14:18,271 --> 02:14:20,220
so they just opened this club maybe.

5389
02:14:20,730 --> 02:14:21,500
How long ago Val?

5390
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:22,560
About six months.

5391
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:25,290
It's only open like six months.

5392
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:26,040
Oh yeah.

5393
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:27,280
I didn't get him a tech with Jamie then.

5394
02:14:27,281 --> 02:14:28,560
I hear it's beautiful.

5395
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:29,310
I hear it's,

5396
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:29,641
you know,

5397
02:14:29,641 --> 02:14:31,080
it's a good size room.

5398
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:31,861
Yeah.

5399
02:14:31,861 --> 02:14:32,850
And it's doing well.

5400
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:35,250
It's kicking ass and there's
a lot of comedy clubs,

5401
02:14:35,251 --> 02:14:36,480
but that would be one of the best.

5402
02:14:36,510 --> 02:14:38,100
Does Vegas have a comedy scene?

5403
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:40,110
They have open mic nights or anything?

5404
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:40,380
Well,

5405
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:41,213
you have,

5406
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:41,820
uh,

5407
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:42,900
a lot of them do,

5408
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:45,270
but you got a lot of clubs there now,

5409
02:14:45,271 --> 02:14:45,810
you know,

5410
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:46,350
uh,

5411
02:14:46,350 --> 02:14:47,760
you got the bread Garrett Room.

5412
02:14:47,761 --> 02:14:49,290
You've got the laugh factory.

5413
02:14:49,670 --> 02:14:50,503
Um,

5414
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:52,650
you got it.

5415
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:56,490
There's a comedy club right at the
Riviera downstairs from the starlight

5416
02:14:56,491 --> 02:14:56,761
theater.

5417
02:14:56,761 --> 02:14:57,061
Does,

5418
02:14:57,061 --> 02:14:58,040
you know the,

5419
02:14:58,050 --> 02:14:59,670
it's the Riviera comedy club.

5420
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:00,993
Um,

5421
02:15:01,110 --> 02:15:01,943
you have,

5422
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:03,810
I know,

5423
02:15:03,810 --> 02:15:05,640
you know downtown,

5424
02:15:05,641 --> 02:15:06,750
there's a lot of clubs.

5425
02:15:06,751 --> 02:15:08,070
I never go downtown,

5426
02:15:08,071 --> 02:15:09,210
but books the river these days.

5427
02:15:09,211 --> 02:15:10,770
It's not Steve Shrimp anymore.

5428
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:11,881
No,

5429
02:15:11,881 --> 02:15:14,390
I think no way he would keep
that after this problem.

5430
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:14,960
No,

5431
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:15,280
no,

5432
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:15,540
it's,

5433
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:16,990
it's just the Riviera books.

5434
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:17,951
I don't know the,

5435
02:15:17,951 --> 02:15:19,350
the big guy in the soprano's,

5436
02:15:19,351 --> 02:15:20,850
what was his character
in the Sopranos name?

5437
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:21,540
Bobby.

5438
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:21,990
Bobby.

5439
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:23,670
Bobby is Steve Sherpa.

5440
02:15:23,671 --> 02:15:26,970
We've known Steve like
before he was ever an actor.

5441
02:15:26,971 --> 02:15:29,010
He was the guy who ran the Riviera.

5442
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:29,641
You know what?

5443
02:15:29,641 --> 02:15:31,080
I would get crazy with him too,

5444
02:15:31,081 --> 02:15:34,380
because I think he's a talented
guy and he's really likable,

5445
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:35,281
you know?

5446
02:15:35,281 --> 02:15:37,050
And when he was doing the sopranos,

5447
02:15:37,051 --> 02:15:37,920
like one in the last,

5448
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:38,970
I'm like,

5449
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:40,530
where's the new show you're going to do?

5450
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,210
Because even though he played a gangster,

5451
02:15:42,211 --> 02:15:44,220
they still this lovable guy
and I'm going to buy it.

5452
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:46,650
You kind of have an ABC Sitcom after this.

5453
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,090
You're the father of three.

5454
02:15:48,091 --> 02:15:49,020
It's that simple.

5455
02:15:49,021 --> 02:15:49,680
Right.

5456
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:50,011
You know,

5457
02:15:50,011 --> 02:15:50,191
and,

5458
02:15:50,191 --> 02:15:53,160
and I'm still waiting for
it because I loved that guy.

5459
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:53,730
It's a lot of,

5460
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:56,190
it's hard for a lot of those
guys to transition from my show.

5461
02:15:56,191 --> 02:15:57,120
That's not memorable,

5462
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:58,680
but not all of them.

5463
02:15:58,681 --> 02:16:01,950
See a lot of them were real
tough guys like just from,

5464
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:04,560
from real life guys
that have been in jail,

5465
02:16:04,890 --> 02:16:05,370
you know,

5466
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:06,091
some of them were,

5467
02:16:06,091 --> 02:16:07,660
were relaxed is but,

5468
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:10,350
but [inaudible] even though
he was with the gangsters,

5469
02:16:10,590 --> 02:16:12,810
he still has that likability,

5470
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:13,140
you know,

5471
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:15,420
that he could have
transitioned very easily.

5472
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:16,330
She tried to find out,

5473
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:16,670
I'm like,

5474
02:16:16,670 --> 02:16:16,891
dude,

5475
02:16:16,891 --> 02:16:17,071
you know,

5476
02:16:17,071 --> 02:16:17,904
he might still,

5477
02:16:17,910 --> 02:16:19,500
they're wearing the sopranos again.

5478
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:20,483
Are they really?

5479
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:22,110
You should try to find
out if he could do it.

5480
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:22,944
If the Riviera.

5481
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:23,710
Yeah.

5482
02:16:23,710 --> 02:16:23,891
Yeah.

5483
02:16:23,891 --> 02:16:25,290
The Riviera comedy club.

5484
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:26,183
That's a good spot.

5485
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,750
Pick a room you want.

5486
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,070
I want like a hundred,

5487
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:29,980
like

5488
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,590
a smaller room.

5489
02:16:30,590 --> 02:16:31,151
Hundred 50.

5490
02:16:31,151 --> 02:16:32,470
I have you ever comedy club?

5491
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:32,800
Yeah.

5492
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,341
That's easy.

5493
02:16:33,341 --> 02:16:34,540
I could probably help you with that.

5494
02:16:35,170 --> 02:16:36,610
What does the Riviera hold?

5495
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:38,020
It was a whole 150 maybe.

5496
02:16:38,021 --> 02:16:38,261
Well,

5497
02:16:38,261 --> 02:16:38,981
the comedy club,

5498
02:16:38,981 --> 02:16:41,200
Kali holds about 300 does it?

5499
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:42,063
Okay.

5500
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,960
And then the place
upstairs where you were at,

5501
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:46,390
Dad holds like five 75.

5502
02:16:46,391 --> 02:16:46,621
So what,

5503
02:16:46,621 --> 02:16:47,201
like what is that?

5504
02:16:47,201 --> 02:16:49,270
The place where that uh,

5505
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:51,370
Mark Moreno used to have a,

5506
02:16:51,371 --> 02:16:53,250
Frank Marino used to
have his drag queen show.

5507
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,520
Thanks.

5508
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:53,770
So,

5509
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:54,310
yeah,

5510
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:55,870
there's like a couple theater.

5511
02:16:56,050 --> 02:16:57,590
It's the only theater I saw in the river.

5512
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:00,220
There's also a thousand
seat theater just like that.

5513
02:17:00,430 --> 02:17:00,931
And by the way,

5514
02:17:00,931 --> 02:17:03,790
you got to use up the word
drag queen while you can,

5515
02:17:03,791 --> 02:17:06,280
before they decide to take all of that.

5516
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:07,300
It's too intense.

5517
02:17:07,350 --> 02:17:08,830
You're not supposed to use twink anymore.

5518
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:12,640
Do you know that even gay guys get
in trouble for using the word twink?

5519
02:17:13,130 --> 02:17:17,050
I never heard it until the
second tank in the gay community.

5520
02:17:17,051 --> 02:17:21,370
A twink is like a small hairless
sort of boyish looking gay boy.

5521
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:26,740
Do you have any idea why did
you have to say that to me?

5522
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:30,030
And then the Andy Cohen and people in,

5523
02:17:30,031 --> 02:17:31,120
in the audiences,

5524
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:31,361
you know,

5525
02:17:31,361 --> 02:17:32,260
what are you a twink?

5526
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:32,621
Yeah,

5527
02:17:32,621 --> 02:17:33,251
exactly.

5528
02:17:33,251 --> 02:17:34,084
That's the new thing.

5529
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:35,501
And the big guys.

5530
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:36,334
A bears.

5531
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:37,390
Yeah,

5532
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:38,590
they just wanted to be called tings.

5533
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:39,760
But Andy Cohen,

5534
02:17:39,761 --> 02:17:42,310
the guy who runs bravo got in trouble.

5535
02:17:42,510 --> 02:17:42,850
Uh,

5536
02:17:42,850 --> 02:17:45,160
he forced to apologize for,

5537
02:17:45,161 --> 02:17:45,790
uh,

5538
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:47,680
calling someone twinks.

5539
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:49,060
He had to like,

5540
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:49,400
he's,

5541
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:50,260
and he's gay.

5542
02:17:50,350 --> 02:17:52,420
He's a gay guy and I love this show.

5543
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:57,421
I love that a gay guy had to
apologize for using the word twink.

5544
02:17:57,460 --> 02:17:57,850
I mean,

5545
02:17:57,850 --> 02:18:01,690
that is God damn cold and I love that guy.

5546
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:04,780
He's trainees that they don't want
to be called trannies anymore.

5547
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:06,950
I used to call them goals.

5548
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:08,021
Well,

5549
02:18:08,021 --> 02:18:08,291
yeah,

5550
02:18:08,291 --> 02:18:09,160
that was my joke.

5551
02:18:09,161 --> 02:18:09,371
I go,

5552
02:18:09,371 --> 02:18:10,690
you meet the girly a dreams,

5553
02:18:10,691 --> 02:18:11,350
right?

5554
02:18:11,350 --> 02:18:12,161
Like I would start off,

5555
02:18:12,161 --> 02:18:12,760
I go,

5556
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:13,031
you know,

5557
02:18:13,031 --> 02:18:14,890
first you got these bisexuals.

5558
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:15,671
You know,

5559
02:18:15,671 --> 02:18:16,451
what does that mean?

5560
02:18:16,451 --> 02:18:18,700
You either suck dick
or you don't Suck Dick.

5561
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:19,534
Right?

5562
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:20,690
What do you get up in the morning?

5563
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:21,670
I got to remember this shit.

5564
02:18:21,950 --> 02:18:22,391
You know,

5565
02:18:22,391 --> 02:18:23,380
flip a coin heads.

5566
02:18:23,381 --> 02:18:24,161
I want hip height,

5567
02:18:24,161 --> 02:18:26,680
tails balls across the nose,

5568
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:29,410
and then I go and now you've
got these other things.

5569
02:18:29,411 --> 02:18:31,210
He's a trans testicles.

5570
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:32,171
You meet the girl,

5571
02:18:32,171 --> 02:18:32,831
he had dreams.

5572
02:18:32,831 --> 02:18:33,910
You want to know your dining.

5573
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:34,980
You put your hand up a script,

5574
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:36,340
you're holding a fucking tree trunk.

5575
02:18:37,150 --> 02:18:37,983
You know,

5576
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,490
this is what the guy said.

5577
02:18:39,491 --> 02:18:39,731
Okay,

5578
02:18:39,731 --> 02:18:41,470
this is how crazy people are today.

5579
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:42,310
Andy Cohen,

5580
02:18:42,310 --> 02:18:43,143
who's the guys,

5581
02:18:43,210 --> 02:18:43,571
he's,

5582
02:18:43,571 --> 02:18:45,250
I guess he's the head of Bravo,

5583
02:18:45,251 --> 02:18:46,900
I guess he's always on those shows.

5584
02:18:46,901 --> 02:18:48,220
He's always like acting as a,

5585
02:18:48,221 --> 02:18:48,850
uh,

5586
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:49,260
you know,

5587
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:50,450
we watch the show here.

5588
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:51,220
Well he's,

5589
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,210
this is what he wrote on Twitter.

5590
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:53,111
No joke.

5591
02:18:53,111 --> 02:18:56,410
I just raw walked right
into one direction.

5592
02:18:56,410 --> 02:18:56,861
Green Room,

5593
02:18:56,861 --> 02:18:58,210
I guess one direction as a band.

5594
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:00,070
The blonde dude was shirtless.

5595
02:19:00,071 --> 02:19:00,850
He says,

5596
02:19:00,850 --> 02:19:05,500
and then his tweet Hashtag holy
twink so he's calling the blonde.

5597
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:06,880
He said the blonde dude was a twink.

5598
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:07,743
He's like,

5599
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:12,460
obviously he's saying he's like a
hot little piece of ass and he had to

5600
02:19:12,461 --> 02:19:13,840
apologize for that

5601
02:19:15,550 --> 02:19:17,110
misused word earlier.

5602
02:19:17,111 --> 02:19:18,490
I just meant they're cute.

5603
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:20,320
He tried to write that
to cover up his truck.

5604
02:19:20,321 --> 02:19:21,640
That's what we've been talking even,

5605
02:19:21,641 --> 02:19:21,971
you know,

5606
02:19:21,971 --> 02:19:23,350
cause we were talking
about it with comedy,

5607
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:24,370
but think about that.

5608
02:19:24,371 --> 02:19:27,010
That's so ridiculous to say.

5609
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:27,790
You got to,

5610
02:19:27,790 --> 02:19:28,130
you know,

5611
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:28,561
have a,

5612
02:19:28,561 --> 02:19:29,930
an apology ready,

5613
02:19:30,310 --> 02:19:31,640
quit Twinkies.

5614
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:33,260
It could you call a press conference,

5615
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:35,810
get behind a fucking podium and go,

5616
02:19:35,811 --> 02:19:36,590
I'm sorry.

5617
02:19:36,590 --> 02:19:38,660
I called the little hot boy.

5618
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:39,494
A twink.

5619
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:44,990
Twink is a contentious word and is
sometimes seen as a derogatory definition

5620
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:47,810
referring to a certain type of homosexual.

5621
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:52,430
Thus Andy experienced crazy Twitter
backlash concerning his comment.

5622
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:54,560
What a group of contacts we have,

5623
02:19:54,770 --> 02:19:57,530
which is the s just a
bunch of silly cunts.

5624
02:19:58,040 --> 02:19:59,690
Just silly dumb people.

5625
02:19:59,691 --> 02:19:59,760
Yeah.

5626
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:01,880
Now how come people don't
get mad at that word anymore?

5627
02:20:01,970 --> 02:20:02,420
I Dunno.

5628
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:03,980
I'm going to use that word to the wheels.

5629
02:20:03,981 --> 02:20:04,550
Fall off.

5630
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:05,390
I will never give up.

5631
02:20:05,391 --> 02:20:06,690
Kind of hold onto Khan.

5632
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:07,640
You will prime my dead.

5633
02:20:07,641 --> 02:20:08,760
Hands off the word con.

5634
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:10,490
I apologize too.

5635
02:20:10,491 --> 02:20:12,110
Like who was like a bangle?

5636
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:12,800
Twinks yeah,

5637
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:12,901
it's,

5638
02:20:12,901 --> 02:20:15,320
Bob says you have to
apologize to the fans,

5639
02:20:15,321 --> 02:20:16,400
I guess of the band.

5640
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:18,710
That's what he had to
apologize for using that word.

5641
02:20:18,830 --> 02:20:22,310
But the people were upset that the
word twink was a derogatory term,

5642
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,960
but it's being used by a gay guy.

5643
02:20:23,961 --> 02:20:25,050
It's like me constantly.

5644
02:20:25,051 --> 02:20:25,460
Again,

5645
02:20:25,460 --> 02:20:26,150
it's silly.

5646
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,831
It's stupid,

5647
02:20:26,831 --> 02:20:28,830
but just like check out those
twinkle twinkles I mean there's,

5648
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:32,120
there's so the craziest culture,

5649
02:20:32,121 --> 02:20:33,470
even in the harshest conditions.

5650
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:35,030
Most of my family's Italian.

5651
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:37,610
If I called someone a crazy
Guinea and you got mad at me,

5652
02:20:37,611 --> 02:20:38,690
you can go fuck yourself.

5653
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:40,041
That's not racist.

5654
02:20:40,041 --> 02:20:40,580
It's me.

5655
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:41,480
I will tell you,

5656
02:20:41,481 --> 02:20:42,141
I'm a mostly,

5657
02:20:42,141 --> 02:20:42,980
I'm mostly Guinea,

5658
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:43,551
you know,

5659
02:20:43,551 --> 02:20:47,210
and that's a source of all sorts
of problems with me biologically.

5660
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:48,860
And they did say that.

5661
02:20:48,861 --> 02:20:49,930
You can't say that it's,

5662
02:20:49,970 --> 02:20:50,990
it's fucking stupid.

5663
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:53,030
This guy is a gay guy and
he's calling someone a twink.

5664
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:54,830
If there's wrong with that,

5665
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:56,540
there's no hope for world.

5666
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,613
That's what I'm saying.

5667
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:58,580
People talk,

5668
02:20:58,610 --> 02:20:59,443
you know what?

5669
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:00,810
Everybody like it,

5670
02:21:00,830 --> 02:21:01,663
you know,

5671
02:21:02,210 --> 02:21:03,530
we can't have that.

5672
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:05,760
It's just fucking stupid already.

5673
02:21:06,310 --> 02:21:06,590
You know,

5674
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:07,670
you say a little thing,

5675
02:21:07,671 --> 02:21:08,720
a cute little thing,

5676
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:08,991
you know,

5677
02:21:08,991 --> 02:21:10,120
he was looking at the guy,

5678
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:10,890
it got probably look,

5679
02:21:10,890 --> 02:21:12,520
I mean who dresses better than Andy?

5680
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:13,940
Not only that,

5681
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:18,940
it's like he's dressed perfectly every
me and my wife watched the show cause we

5682
02:21:19,131 --> 02:21:20,330
watch all those crazy,

5683
02:21:20,331 --> 02:21:20,571
you know,

5684
02:21:20,571 --> 02:21:21,470
housewives,

5685
02:21:21,870 --> 02:21:22,970
you know the Miami,

5686
02:21:22,971 --> 02:21:23,804
you see them?

5687
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:24,743
Yeah,

5688
02:21:24,770 --> 02:21:25,410
they fight.

5689
02:21:25,410 --> 02:21:26,870
They're the only ones worth watching.

5690
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:27,440
They fight,

5691
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:27,740
you know,

5692
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:28,790
let's Cuba bitches this,

5693
02:21:28,791 --> 02:21:29,660
they're tropical.

5694
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,570
They'll throw low that
you could understand.

5695
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,453
You know what I mean?

5696
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:36,200
Like when we go to Florida,

5697
02:21:36,201 --> 02:21:40,040
my wife will catch me just watching the
Tele Mundo and all the dressing rooms,

5698
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:40,621
you know,

5699
02:21:40,621 --> 02:21:43,190
and now you can at least understand
what the fuck they're saying.

5700
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:47,450
It's a Ma amazing that just following
idiots around with a camera has become

5701
02:21:47,630 --> 02:21:48,770
awesome entertainment.

5702
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:50,510
But at sometimes that could take it.

5703
02:21:50,511 --> 02:21:51,380
Sometimes I can't.

5704
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:51,771
Yeah,

5705
02:21:51,771 --> 02:21:52,220
this is me,

5706
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:52,401
you know,

5707
02:21:52,401 --> 02:21:53,000
because it's,

5708
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,050
you know all those shows.

5709
02:21:54,051 --> 02:21:55,250
It's about the fight now.

5710
02:21:55,251 --> 02:21:56,990
You know it's always about the fighting.

5711
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:58,370
You know what I watch man,

5712
02:21:58,550 --> 02:22:00,200
I don't want to see these chicks banging.

5713
02:22:00,290 --> 02:22:02,600
All are these days is Alaska shows.

5714
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:06,200
I've been on this crazy Alaska kick for
the last couple of months cause it's

5715
02:22:06,201 --> 02:22:09,800
like four or five different shows about
people trying to survive in Alaska.

5716
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:11,570
It's fascinating shit man.

5717
02:22:11,571 --> 02:22:14,870
Watching people out there just trying to
catch as many salmon as they can freeze

5718
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:17,810
because they have to realize that it's
going to be winter for eight months.

5719
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,430
That's all I've been watching.

5720
02:22:19,431 --> 02:22:22,520
So I watched that and then I watch
like the real housewives shows and they

5721
02:22:22,521 --> 02:22:25,320
looked so stupid because
their issues are so small.

5722
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:26,410
Like in the Alaska shows,

5723
02:22:26,420 --> 02:22:26,670
they're like,

5724
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:27,540
I got to go show you.

5725
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:29,070
You can't compare,

5726
02:22:29,071 --> 02:22:29,600
you know?

5727
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:30,060
Yeah.

5728
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:30,481
You know,

5729
02:22:30,481 --> 02:22:31,950
real life shit to a,

5730
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:32,311
you know,

5731
02:22:32,311 --> 02:22:37,311
well you called what I did and you
know Anneka and they stand for that.

5732
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:44,500
And then the one with the boyfriend that
just as fucking everything behind her

5733
02:22:44,501 --> 02:22:45,320
back split.

5734
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:46,860
We love each other.

5735
02:22:46,870 --> 02:22:49,200
Shut up and fuck somebody else already.

5736
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:52,200
Let's start a new storyline here.

5737
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:53,191
What am I going to see?

5738
02:22:53,191 --> 02:22:58,191
13 episodes of you fighting with
the guy that owns nightclubs,

5739
02:22:58,380 --> 02:22:59,450
about other chicks.

5740
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:01,410
Didn't you know what you
were getting involved in?

5741
02:23:01,650 --> 02:23:04,710
Did you use your fucking head
for a split second already?

5742
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:05,581
Yeah.

5743
02:23:05,581 --> 02:23:06,510
He's silly bitch.

5744
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:07,170
You know,

5745
02:23:07,170 --> 02:23:07,500
that's,

5746
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:09,240
that's what goes on with these girls.

5747
02:23:09,241 --> 02:23:09,571
It's like,

5748
02:23:09,571 --> 02:23:12,960
just stop it if he's not feel
bang somebody else already.

5749
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:16,770
Well it's just interesting that that
would even be entertaining to people.

5750
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,040
It really is because so much pleasure.

5751
02:23:20,070 --> 02:23:21,690
It's almost like saying to people,

5752
02:23:21,691 --> 02:23:23,640
get out of their cars
and start an argument.

5753
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:24,570
You're going to watch it.

5754
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:27,780
But when I watched the difference
between no shows and these Alaska shows,

5755
02:23:27,781 --> 02:23:29,310
these subsistence living shows,

5756
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:32,610
but I do because it's humans.

5757
02:23:32,611 --> 02:23:36,210
I'm just watching humans in Alaska live
their life and it's like I'm watching

5758
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:41,070
live their life they live in and looking
to survive to the problem is what I

5759
02:23:41,071 --> 02:23:42,180
think is that all their,

5760
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:42,661
their,

5761
02:23:42,661 --> 02:23:46,680
their natural needs have been taken
care of as far as like gathering food,

5762
02:23:46,770 --> 02:23:48,360
having a place of shelter,

5763
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:49,710
being protected from the elements.

5764
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:50,820
You don't have to worry about that.

5765
02:23:50,821 --> 02:23:54,450
That's interesting to watch because they
don't have to worry about that shit.

5766
02:23:54,451 --> 02:23:57,510
Then they constantly on this bitch
says something to me and I'm going to

5767
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:58,020
conduct,

5768
02:23:58,020 --> 02:23:59,610
they're always fucking drunk.

5769
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:01,380
Every fucking show,

5770
02:24:01,381 --> 02:24:02,190
every radio.

5771
02:24:02,190 --> 02:24:04,140
I don't want to get
angry over reality shows,

5772
02:24:04,410 --> 02:24:05,610
but every one of them,

5773
02:24:05,611 --> 02:24:06,090
you know,

5774
02:24:06,090 --> 02:24:09,480
well let's meet for breakfast
and they're opening up dumb.

5775
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:09,860
Right.

5776
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:10,610
You know,

5777
02:24:10,610 --> 02:24:10,900
well,

5778
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:12,960
why are we drinking at breakfast?

5779
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:16,290
Because you don't have to go
collect Caribou and all of that.

5780
02:24:16,830 --> 02:24:17,481
That's right.

5781
02:24:17,481 --> 02:24:17,710
Yeah.

5782
02:24:17,710 --> 02:24:21,390
You're not cutting a hole in the fucking
night if you have to go out there and

5783
02:24:21,391 --> 02:24:22,290
go shoot a bear.

5784
02:24:22,291 --> 02:24:23,880
Otherwise you have no
meat in your freezer.

5785
02:24:23,881 --> 02:24:25,410
That's a completely different situation.

5786
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:26,730
This thing.

5787
02:24:26,730 --> 02:24:26,881
Yeah,

5788
02:24:26,881 --> 02:24:27,391
it's what it is.

5789
02:24:27,391 --> 02:24:27,601
You know,

5790
02:24:27,601 --> 02:24:29,250
I can't feel bad,

5791
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:29,941
you know,

5792
02:24:29,941 --> 02:24:34,050
for a girl that's living in
an 18,000 square foot home,

5793
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:34,861
you know,

5794
02:24:34,861 --> 02:24:37,260
drinking liquor for breakfast,

5795
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:38,101
you know,

5796
02:24:38,101 --> 02:24:39,700
but I could feel bad for the,

5797
02:24:39,701 --> 02:24:40,111
you know,

5798
02:24:40,111 --> 02:24:42,560
the Little Alaska and guy that my fault,

5799
02:24:42,561 --> 02:24:43,320
where the ice.

5800
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:47,960
I feel like if I had to choose between
living with those cons in Miami or live

5801
02:24:47,970 --> 02:24:48,161
in,

5802
02:24:48,161 --> 02:24:48,994
in Alaska,

5803
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:51,690
I would live in Alaska and I'd
have to go with the Miami thing.

5804
02:24:52,050 --> 02:24:52,861
I don't think it would be able,

5805
02:24:52,861 --> 02:24:53,910
if I had to live with them.

5806
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,180
If you had to live in a house with
those people or live in Alaska,

5807
02:24:57,330 --> 02:24:58,110
it's still a chip.

5808
02:24:58,110 --> 02:24:58,340
There's,

5809
02:24:58,340 --> 02:24:59,173
they're so dumb.

5810
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:00,900
There's so much dumbness.

5811
02:25:00,930 --> 02:25:02,350
There's so much where you would just like,

5812
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:05,460
I'm going to have to hypnotize you people
and start from scratch because there's

5813
02:25:05,461 --> 02:25:06,001
only one way.

5814
02:25:06,001 --> 02:25:08,220
We're gonna have to raise your mind
and I'm going to have to program,

5815
02:25:08,221 --> 02:25:08,331
you know,

5816
02:25:08,331 --> 02:25:08,760
I'm going to get up.

5817
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:10,110
You have a lot of checks to see.

5818
02:25:11,250 --> 02:25:13,460
I'll tell you a show you would
like cause it reminds me of you,

5819
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:15,420
the way they explain everything happening.

5820
02:25:16,050 --> 02:25:16,883
Uh,

5821
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:17,581
what is it?

5822
02:25:17,581 --> 02:25:18,890
I shouldn't have been around it,

5823
02:25:18,891 --> 02:25:20,250
but I was what?

5824
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:21,153
What's the name

5825
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:24,130
should be

5826
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,610
the Nitel or your next album.

5827
02:25:26,090 --> 02:25:27,510
And she should been around them.

5828
02:25:27,511 --> 02:25:29,150
But I always forget the exact,

5829
02:25:29,180 --> 02:25:30,710
she knows what going to be alive.

5830
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:31,880
I shouldn't be alive.

5831
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:32,773
Oh

5832
02:25:34,190 --> 02:25:34,521
yeah.

5833
02:25:34,521 --> 02:25:35,420
Like you know what I mean?

5834
02:25:37,950 --> 02:25:39,260
I shouldn't have been around live,

5835
02:25:39,261 --> 02:25:40,094
but it was,

5836
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:45,740
they decide what a beautiful day I'm
going to climb the biggest mountain in the

5837
02:25:45,741 --> 02:25:46,310
world.

5838
02:25:46,310 --> 02:25:46,591
Yeah.

5839
02:25:46,591 --> 02:25:47,211
Well thinking,

5840
02:25:47,211 --> 02:25:47,481
you know,

5841
02:25:47,481 --> 02:25:50,190
this is going to go off without a
hitch with that guy when it through his

5842
02:25:50,191 --> 02:25:51,000
fucking arm.

5843
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,410
The guy who got stuck under that
rock and they made a movie about him.

5844
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:56,780
No,

5845
02:25:56,780 --> 02:25:58,650
but have you watched the
show I'm talking about?

5846
02:25:58,670 --> 02:25:59,060
Yes.

5847
02:25:59,060 --> 02:25:59,250
Yeah,

5848
02:25:59,250 --> 02:25:59,690
I've seen it.

5849
02:25:59,690 --> 02:26:00,150
Yeah.

5850
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:01,280
And they explain things like,

5851
02:26:01,281 --> 02:26:01,540
you know,

5852
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:02,970
I always go back to salt,

5853
02:26:04,070 --> 02:26:04,810
you know,

5854
02:26:04,810 --> 02:26:06,120
mineral is a mineral.

5855
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:09,600
That lady that's still
probably sitting there shaking.

5856
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:11,233
You know,

5857
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:13,830
I get so mad over the woman's a monster.

5858
02:26:13,890 --> 02:26:15,030
She was a monster all night.

5859
02:26:15,031 --> 02:26:16,890
She's a monster in the
audience who's a monster.

5860
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:19,200
And she was like a middle aged lady,

5861
02:26:19,201 --> 02:26:19,440
right?

5862
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:19,830
No,

5863
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:20,080
no.

5864
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,930
She's like late thirties overweight.

5865
02:26:21,931 --> 02:26:22,640
Angry.

5866
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:23,473
Nope.

5867
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:27,030
And you weren't even looking at her and
she was like talking to somebody else

5868
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,940
about salt and what you call it again.

5869
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:30,691
Oh no,

5870
02:26:30,691 --> 02:26:33,900
she was telling everybody how good for Ya.

5871
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:38,400
Just sitting minding his own business
and all of a sudden the rage,

5872
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:39,550
you know,

5873
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:41,280
it was like a show off the stage.

5874
02:26:41,490 --> 02:26:42,300
It goes,

5875
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:44,880
what the fuck are you talking about?

5876
02:26:45,210 --> 02:26:47,310
What do you know about anything?

5877
02:26:47,311 --> 02:26:48,330
Like he knew her.

5878
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:50,790
Like she knows nothing about anything.

5879
02:26:50,791 --> 02:26:51,390
He goes,

5880
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:51,601
hey,

5881
02:26:51,601 --> 02:26:53,310
tough fucking mineral.

5882
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:55,070
You tell this story
every time you do this.

5883
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:57,390
I love cause you didn't see your face.

5884
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:59,460
That was the beauty of that.

5885
02:26:59,461 --> 02:27:02,220
And I explained to you that that
kind of had been a problem all night.

5886
02:27:02,890 --> 02:27:04,500
But I always forget that part.

5887
02:27:04,530 --> 02:27:04,680
Yeah,

5888
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:05,880
that part's not as interesting.

5889
02:27:06,370 --> 02:27:07,360
But when you know,

5890
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:09,300
when she was telling people about salt,

5891
02:27:09,330 --> 02:27:11,220
but you shouldn't have
any salt in your diet.

5892
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:12,011
And I was like,

5893
02:27:12,011 --> 02:27:12,161
what?

5894
02:27:12,161 --> 02:27:13,970
It says the central mineral stupid.

5895
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:14,151
Like,

5896
02:27:14,151 --> 02:27:14,831
what are you talking about?

5897
02:27:14,831 --> 02:27:15,050
Tow.

5898
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:17,020
It started and then you've got to change.

5899
02:27:17,610 --> 02:27:20,670
Then it was Rogan mean that
she wasn't there for that.

5900
02:27:20,671 --> 02:27:21,420
I wasn't there.

5901
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:22,190
That was when it got,

5902
02:27:22,190 --> 02:27:22,951
you know my other thing,

5903
02:27:22,951 --> 02:27:24,570
I know I bring that up all the time,

5904
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:27,210
but I like the way you break
things down is what I'm saying.

5905
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:28,950
That's what I was really like on the show.

5906
02:27:28,951 --> 02:27:29,784
Like uh,

5907
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:31,210
I shouldn't have been around it,

5908
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:35,700
but it was like they break it down
like everything that's happening to the

5909
02:27:35,701 --> 02:27:38,370
person and I know you really
understand those things.

5910
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:39,780
That shows a bad show.

5911
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:43,590
I'll tell you a thing I like to do
on different shows with the same guy,

5912
02:27:43,650 --> 02:27:46,020
like if it's the same host
of a radio show or something,

5913
02:27:46,470 --> 02:27:49,980
I love to congratulate them
on their wife's pregnancy.

5914
02:27:50,310 --> 02:27:51,420
Knowing there is none,

5915
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:52,381
you know?

5916
02:27:52,381 --> 02:27:54,570
And if the second time
the guy would be like,

5917
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:57,060
dice you said this last time,

5918
02:27:57,061 --> 02:27:58,230
my wife isn't pregnant.

5919
02:27:58,740 --> 02:27:59,490
And I go,

5920
02:27:59,490 --> 02:27:59,801
no,

5921
02:27:59,801 --> 02:28:00,001
what,

5922
02:28:00,001 --> 02:28:00,241
what?

5923
02:28:00,241 --> 02:28:02,240
She had the baby and he's called,

5924
02:28:02,310 --> 02:28:03,510
she was never pregnant.

5925
02:28:03,511 --> 02:28:06,750
We don't even want kids and
they get angry about it.

5926
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:09,630
And I'll just stay on
it every time I come on.

5927
02:28:09,990 --> 02:28:11,190
But that's purposely,

5928
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:12,570
well you would have these,

5929
02:28:12,571 --> 02:28:13,920
I love to effect people.

5930
02:28:13,930 --> 02:28:16,680
These little gags that you
would run at the store.

5931
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:19,550
We'd have people like
acting out certain things.

5932
02:28:19,580 --> 02:28:23,420
You were videotaping it with cameras so
you'd like get off stage and there was

5933
02:28:23,421 --> 02:28:26,060
like a play going on
in the fucking hallway.

5934
02:28:26,061 --> 02:28:26,631
Like what?

5935
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:27,440
What is happening?

5936
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,730
You got to see those tapes.

5937
02:28:28,731 --> 02:28:29,271
I'm telling you.

5938
02:28:29,271 --> 02:28:30,500
What do you do with all those tapes?

5939
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:31,363
Nothing.

5940
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:33,590
This is what I think the pilot has to be.

5941
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:34,730
I just love filming it.

5942
02:28:34,770 --> 02:28:35,331
I this is what the,

5943
02:28:35,331 --> 02:28:36,240
I think [inaudible] your podcast.

5944
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:37,490
Tom Green always calls me up.

5945
02:28:37,491 --> 02:28:37,761
He goes,

5946
02:28:37,761 --> 02:28:38,900
let's film something.

5947
02:28:39,170 --> 02:28:39,651
And I'm like,

5948
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:40,484
for what?

5949
02:28:40,490 --> 02:28:41,600
All I do is film.

5950
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:43,430
Cause he likes doing that shit too.

5951
02:28:43,431 --> 02:28:44,990
But he'll actually air somewhere.

5952
02:28:44,991 --> 02:28:45,824
He'll put it somewhere.

5953
02:28:46,350 --> 02:28:47,960
How awesome would this be if you had,

5954
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:52,130
you just had a humongous box of tapes
behind you all random and each podcast at

5955
02:28:52,131 --> 02:28:53,450
the beginning he just grabbed one,

5956
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:54,110
put it in.

5957
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:56,170
He kind of gave like a
commentary while it's going on.

5958
02:28:56,190 --> 02:28:56,360
Like,

5959
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:56,601
oh,

5960
02:28:56,601 --> 02:28:57,321
this is from,

5961
02:28:57,321 --> 02:28:57,830
you know,

5962
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:59,300
the comedy store obviously.

5963
02:28:59,301 --> 02:29:00,320
Let's see what's going on here.

5964
02:29:01,170 --> 02:29:02,150
What I was doing it,

5965
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:02,361
no,

5966
02:29:02,361 --> 02:29:03,680
that's actually funny.

5967
02:29:03,681 --> 02:29:07,310
But that was since to those tapes,

5968
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:08,310
you know,

5969
02:29:08,310 --> 02:29:10,680
even though it seems like when he goes,

5970
02:29:10,970 --> 02:29:11,241
Joe,

5971
02:29:11,241 --> 02:29:11,661
it asks me,

5972
02:29:11,661 --> 02:29:12,350
he goes,

5973
02:29:12,350 --> 02:29:13,850
what are you doing with the camera?

5974
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:14,331
And I'm like,

5975
02:29:14,331 --> 02:29:15,290
I'm filming the show.

5976
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:16,820
But that was no show,

5977
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:20,390
but yet I was making it a
show and I really just love,

5978
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:22,220
so when I'd come to the comedy store,

5979
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:22,790
you know,

5980
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:25,610
I'd still kicking weight and the show
is going on in the original room.

5981
02:29:25,611 --> 02:29:28,040
I used the store as my set,

5982
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:29,121
you know,

5983
02:29:29,121 --> 02:29:31,070
and like the newer comics at the time,

5984
02:29:31,071 --> 02:29:31,311
like,

5985
02:29:31,311 --> 02:29:32,144
uh,

5986
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:34,130
like Steve Run is easy.

5987
02:29:34,550 --> 02:29:34,881
You know,

5988
02:29:34,881 --> 02:29:35,740
Ori,

5989
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:36,440
uh,

5990
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:37,610
Bobby Lee,

5991
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:38,750
these were like the,

5992
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:40,680
the new generation of comics coming.

5993
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:41,510
So I would,

5994
02:29:41,510 --> 02:29:45,200
I would film all these guys and they
couldn't wait for me to get there because

5995
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:47,330
they never knew what they had to do.

5996
02:29:47,331 --> 02:29:51,020
And I would tell them exactly
what I need them to say,

5997
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:52,190
you know?

5998
02:29:52,190 --> 02:29:52,880
And I would say,

5999
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:53,211
all right,

6000
02:29:53,211 --> 02:29:57,020
you wait four seconds and you say it
exactly like they didn't even have a

6001
02:29:57,070 --> 02:29:57,903
choices.

6002
02:29:58,220 --> 02:29:59,750
How to say it as an actor,

6003
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:01,310
why didn't you do something with it all?

6004
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:02,173
Who am I going to do?

6005
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:03,800
But you spent so much time,

6006
02:30:03,801 --> 02:30:04,880
we were looking forward to it.

6007
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:06,200
You have no idea how.

6008
02:30:06,201 --> 02:30:06,591
I was like,

6009
02:30:06,591 --> 02:30:06,771
wow,

6010
02:30:06,771 --> 02:30:07,451
one day I die,

6011
02:30:07,451 --> 02:30:08,284
it's going to release it.

6012
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:08,870
And you're like,

6013
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:09,703
oh okay.

6014
02:30:09,990 --> 02:30:11,510
Well my son Max says,

6015
02:30:11,511 --> 02:30:12,100
you know,

6016
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:12,800
we got to,

6017
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:14,090
these are the lost tapes.

6018
02:30:14,091 --> 02:30:17,210
We got to call them and start
putting things on like youtube,

6019
02:30:17,220 --> 02:30:21,320
have them edit it into little cause
said we'll always scenarios going on.

6020
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:22,730
How many hours of footage do you have?

6021
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:23,600
Oh thousands.

6022
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,113
Thousands.

6023
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:27,523
You know,

6024
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:28,580
just madness.

6025
02:30:28,610 --> 02:30:29,211
I have this,

6026
02:30:29,211 --> 02:30:29,540
uh,

6027
02:30:29,540 --> 02:30:29,960
this,

6028
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:30,680
uh,

6029
02:30:30,680 --> 02:30:33,740
cause I did film a lot of
stuff career wise that um,

6030
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:38,090
there's this young filmmakers
names John Myers and he's,

6031
02:30:38,150 --> 02:30:39,350
he's putting together,

6032
02:30:39,351 --> 02:30:42,500
he's lugging all my footage now to make a,

6033
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:42,840
you know,

6034
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:44,030
documentary movie.

6035
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:44,870
That's what it was.

6036
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:45,740
But I filmed,

6037
02:30:45,741 --> 02:30:45,981
you know,

6038
02:30:45,981 --> 02:30:46,880
all the way back.

6039
02:30:46,881 --> 02:30:50,480
Like first it was all the
big shows being on the road,

6040
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:51,050
all of it.

6041
02:30:51,050 --> 02:30:55,010
I'd get my home life if that's
how I started with practicing.

6042
02:30:55,011 --> 02:30:56,990
Just filming myself without a crew.

6043
02:30:57,160 --> 02:31:00,460
And the special comes
out this Monday night,

6044
02:31:00,461 --> 02:31:01,750
New Year's Eve as Monday night,

6045
02:31:01,751 --> 02:31:02,040
right?

6046
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:02,801
New Year's Eve.

6047
02:31:02,801 --> 02:31:04,630
This Monday night show time.

6048
02:31:04,690 --> 02:31:05,523
What time is it?

6049
02:31:05,590 --> 02:31:07,840
10:00 PM 10:00 PM and uh,

6050
02:31:08,050 --> 02:31:10,270
and so it's over at 11
it's a one hour show.

6051
02:31:10,750 --> 02:31:13,150
So set your dvrs if you're
not going to be home,

6052
02:31:13,151 --> 02:31:15,460
if you're out partying
second dvrs and check it out.

6053
02:31:15,490 --> 02:31:18,850
That show that I saw in
Vegas was fucking awesome.

6054
02:31:19,310 --> 02:31:20,020
And the best comedy

6055
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:21,790
shows I've seen in a long time.

6056
02:31:21,791 --> 02:31:22,624
Last 10 years.

6057
02:31:22,780 --> 02:31:23,500
You read bed,

6058
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,870
we fucking how old?

6059
02:31:24,871 --> 02:31:25,870
It was really fun.

6060
02:31:25,871 --> 02:31:26,080
It was,

6061
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:28,270
it was just a fun night
with you guys hanging out.

6062
02:31:28,330 --> 02:31:28,541
It was,

6063
02:31:28,541 --> 02:31:29,321
we had a great time.

6064
02:31:29,321 --> 02:31:31,000
It was old school dice and it was,

6065
02:31:31,001 --> 02:31:31,181
you know,

6066
02:31:31,181 --> 02:31:33,990
Anthony Kumi and Jim Norton and Sam.

6067
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:34,241
It was,

6068
02:31:34,241 --> 02:31:35,170
we had a great crew.

6069
02:31:35,171 --> 02:31:36,310
Bobby Kelly was there too.

6070
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:36,750
Yeah.

6071
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:38,810
I love that you made
me like love that guy.

6072
02:31:38,811 --> 02:31:39,930
I know Bobby Kelly.

6073
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:42,130
I didn't know him up to that point.

6074
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:42,880
He's the best.

6075
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:43,480
Yeah.

6076
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:44,860
Just a nice guy.

6077
02:31:44,861 --> 02:31:45,521
You know what I mean?

6078
02:31:45,521 --> 02:31:45,761
Very,

6079
02:31:45,761 --> 02:31:46,180
very.

6080
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:49,770
And of course I had a fuck with him at
the beginning and what he to that can't

6081
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:51,040
get a picture for what?

6082
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:52,103
Yeah.

6083
02:31:52,330 --> 02:31:52,661
You know,

6084
02:31:52,661 --> 02:31:53,620
we don't know each other.

6085
02:31:53,770 --> 02:31:54,490
You know,

6086
02:31:54,490 --> 02:31:59,080
like why would you want a picture of us
like in a book and then I took like 20

6087
02:31:59,081 --> 02:31:59,670
of them with them.

6088
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:00,310
Yeah.

6089
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:02,590
He loves you that that
show is fucking phenomenal.

6090
02:32:02,591 --> 02:32:04,000
And that's going to be the basement,

6091
02:32:04,010 --> 02:32:07,510
the same set as it's more
intense than what you saw.

6092
02:32:07,870 --> 02:32:09,070
I mean the same material,

6093
02:32:09,090 --> 02:32:11,050
a lot of the same fucking great,

6094
02:32:11,051 --> 02:32:11,381
great,

6095
02:32:11,381 --> 02:32:12,040
great stuff.

6096
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:12,791
And it's like I said,

6097
02:32:12,791 --> 02:32:14,050
it's old school dies.

6098
02:32:14,051 --> 02:32:16,160
It's really like going
back to some of your,

6099
02:32:16,190 --> 02:32:17,610
your earlier work,

6100
02:32:17,830 --> 02:32:20,620
keeping the voice it would say and just,

6101
02:32:20,650 --> 02:32:20,981
you know,

6102
02:32:20,981 --> 02:32:22,780
pounding on people aggressive.

6103
02:32:23,810 --> 02:32:24,130
Well,

6104
02:32:24,130 --> 02:32:24,341
yeah,

6105
02:32:24,341 --> 02:32:28,210
I got pretty aggressive with some guy in
the front row that wanted to talk when

6106
02:32:28,211 --> 02:32:28,630
I'm doing,

6107
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:28,910
you know,

6108
02:32:28,910 --> 02:32:29,500
film,

6109
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:30,333
you know,

6110
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:31,510
and I had to threaten him,

6111
02:32:31,511 --> 02:32:32,500
but I left it in,

6112
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:33,843
you know,

6113
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:34,211
you know,

6114
02:32:34,211 --> 02:32:35,800
because I know people watching.

6115
02:32:35,801 --> 02:32:36,730
You're going to look and go,

6116
02:32:36,731 --> 02:32:37,120
yeah,

6117
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:39,010
he's threatening to choke this guy.

6118
02:32:39,011 --> 02:32:39,450
Yeah.

6119
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:40,283
You know,

6120
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:41,651
it was great stuff.

6121
02:32:41,651 --> 02:32:42,640
It's great material.

6122
02:32:42,670 --> 02:32:44,440
And if it's even better than that,

6123
02:32:44,441 --> 02:32:45,580
then the show that I saw in Vegas,

6124
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:48,790
because I still had months
after you were there,

6125
02:32:48,791 --> 02:32:49,990
so other bits came.

6126
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:50,801
I appreciate that,

6127
02:32:50,801 --> 02:32:51,100
man.

6128
