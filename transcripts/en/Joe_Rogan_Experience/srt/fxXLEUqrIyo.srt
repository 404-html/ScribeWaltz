1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,590
And there's a,

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,840
there's other ones too.

4
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:04,081
There's,

5
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,210
there's other like crazy,

6
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:06,930
uh,

7
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,120
giant Lizard fucking things that,

8
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,500
that exist in like Bali and
Indonesia and like in the,

9
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,160
like there's,

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,410
there's like monitors
like crocodile monitors.

11
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:18,060
He ever seen those fucking
things I haven't said,

12
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,451
hey,

13
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,040
they get fucking big,

14
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,580
they don't even know how big they
get because they set traps for one.

15
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:26,940
I watched this one documentary where
they set a trap for one and it was so big

16
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:28,200
it destroyed their trap.

17
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,110
So like what are those?

18
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,600
No idea how big this thing is.

19
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,790
Cause there's the stories that
they get as big as crocodiles.

20
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,080
So what are those fucking things?

21
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,283
They

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,580
don't go there.

23
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,530
Fucking frock and I monitor jacks.

24
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:40,830
You,

25
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,690
whew.

26
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,920
Could you imagine just even fighting a
20 pound lizard that wanted to kill you?

27
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,490
Just a 20 pound fucked up lizard with
big teeth that was just going after you

28
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,660
would terrifying.

29
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,570
Now imagine that 300 pound lizard,

30
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,360
that's like 600 pound
lizard as like a nightmare.

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,561
I mean,

32
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,240
how big are fucking crocodiles?

33
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,370
Jesus fucking Christ.

34
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,770
That's one of those bad
trip nightmares right there.

35
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,300
That's when you took too much,

36
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,680
too many mushrooms.

37
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,300
We had an episode of fear factor.

38
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,670
What we did something with
little little baby alligators.

39
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,481
They're a little tiny,

40
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,560
tiny little alligators,

41
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,730
but it was a trip because we,

42
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:14,911
you know,

43
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,420
we had a bunch of them and I was watching
him like fuck around in this tank and

44
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,770
swim or around next to each other.

45
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,370
I'm like,

46
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,620
what a crazy life form.

47
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,131
Crazy,

48
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:23,430
right.

49
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,030
It really was like watching
like Ridley Scott Alien,

50
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,601
you know,

51
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:27,901
it was like,

52
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,351
look at this.

53
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,161
This is like an alien.

54
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,020
This is like a crazy little swimming,

55
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:35,370
little snapping ala cause I can get like
right up next to it and snap the fuck

56
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:35,730
out of you.

57
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,620
If it got a hold of you,

58
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,850
I'll kill you.

59
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,020
He would love to kill you.

60
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:41,640
That little guy would love to kill you.

61
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,200
It's a little tiny thing and be like,

62
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,541
Ooh,

63
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,161
if I could kill you,

64
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:44,970
that would be awesome.

65
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,200
Something that small right,

66
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,210
right away wants to kill you.

67
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:48,961
Fuck you.

68
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,160
Little Baby Crocodile.

69
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,730
Fuck you want that baby crocodile
will make a belt out of him.

70
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,350
You ever seen?

71
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,440
There's a video of one dude who
likes swims with a crocodile.

72
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,281
It's like,

73
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,290
apparently though it's,

74
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,270
it's a Costa Rican crocodile and the the,

75
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,820
the crocodiles in Costa Rica,

76
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:06,510
like for some reason more calm,

77
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,211
Brian Cowen,

78
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:09,770
my friend Brian,

79
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,350
they don't necessarily snap on you
right away and they're like kinda chill.

80
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,600
So this kind of like
swims with this crocodile,

81
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,750
like gets in the water,

82
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,510
rolls around with it and
shit and plays with it.

83
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:18,841
And you're like,

84
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,760
what am I watching?

85
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,500
Like it's his fucking dog.

86
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,053
My dog.

87
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,100
A fucking dog.

88
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,270
This is my water dog right here.

89
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,511
Like,

90
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:31,380
why are you doing that?

91
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,550
You crazy asshole,

92
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,590
man.

93
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,870
That's one of those guys where you
hear about him on youtube later.

94
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,610
Oh for sure.

95
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,440
And like the hippo,

96
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,250
Gosh,

97
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,350
you remember the hippo guy?

98
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,260
There's a South American or South
African guy who had a hippo.

99
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,610
He would ride it and he would,

100
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,610
they would take video of him
riding his fucking hippo.

101
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,370
Yay.

102
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,791
Here we go.

103
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,360
My wait.

104
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,340
The hippo is the guy.

105
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,390
This is the crocodile.

106
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,290
The dude plays with,

107
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,790
look at this crazy motherfucker.

108
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,050
Look at him.

109
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,741
He's petting it.

110
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,431
Got Damn.

111
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,360
That thinks terrifying.

112
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,194
Looking.

113
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
Look at this.

114
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,380
Let's do it as getting
in the water right now.

115
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,213
The,

116
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,790
the cross sale just rolls over on
its back and he rubs its belly.

117
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,990
This is insanity.

118
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,341
Crazy.

119
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:15,970
Fuck.

120
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,200
This is insanity.

121
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,290
This is the lack of mega dog.

122
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,370
Yeah.

123
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,990
This dude is just hanging on to
this crocodile riding with it.

124
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,623
Jesus.

125
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,503
Fuck.

126
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,650
Yeah.

127
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,483
Yeah.

128
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,110
He's crazy.

129
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,943
I'm way too high.

130
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,120
Way Too high to be watching

131
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,170

132
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,180
He don't fuck with them.

133
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,860
Fucking crazy.

134
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,360
Do you have asshole?

135
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,900
You got to us crazy.

136
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,130
Oh,

137
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,540
dinosaur with a brain.

138
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,740
The size of a peanut.

139
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,700
A peanut.

140
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,481
That's crazy,

141
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,050
man.

142
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,920
How big is their brains?

143
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,870
It's like nonsense.

144
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,780
They're not that big.

145
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,361
It's like a nut.

146
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:55,041
Like a walnut,

147
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:55,460
right?

148
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,761
Yeah.

149
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:56,810
So trading him.

150
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:57,200
I don't,

151
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,670

152
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,860
uh Oh.

153
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,440
How'd you don't train that thing?

154
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:00,981
Don't train.

155
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:01,410
That is,

156
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,810
wait until it fucking kills you.

157
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,790
One day it's going to decide to kill you.

158
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,630
You hopefully hypnotized this thing
with this is going to wake up and go,

159
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:08,740
well,

160
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm a crocodile.

161
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:10,790
Who is this asshole?

162
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,624
It's just,

163
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,010
especially as it gets old,

164
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,120
it gets old and mean.

165
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,410
The yard is bullshit.

166
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,610
I don't want to swim today,

167
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:16,970

168
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,611
She don't want to sweat.
