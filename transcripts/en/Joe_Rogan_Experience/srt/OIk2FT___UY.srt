00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,853
Hello

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,570
Bitches,
I'm,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,940
I can,
I just get incredibly man.

4
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,450
I'm fucking again.
I waiting a good day.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,020
First of all,
I can't find it.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,200
Shoot when I don't have my own ice
skates.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,930
So I have to rent.
Ice Skates is for the same reason why I

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,350
couldn't for years.
I can rent.

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,240
Those are fucking shitty.
Well it's not even just that my feet are

10
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,640
too wide.
So if I had a regular size 11,

11
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:26,340
my feet,
I have someone in my background fucked a

12
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:30,690
monkey when it was big fucking big foot
one time ago.

13
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,360
Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck
monkeys anymore.

14
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,340
Someone just went back in for one more
shot,

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,710
fucked a monkey.
Guaranteed.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
It was like the last,
like last call evolution last car and

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,170
one of my ancestors just snuck back in
and got one more nut off.

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,370
Um,
but my feet are just too wide so I get

19
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:50,790
in those things.

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,950
I'm just in agony and I just never
learned how.

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,280
And I'm not gonna I'm not interesting
enough for me to go out and buy ice

22
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,530
skates.
Know it felt like this is it.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,130
It's just something I have to conquer.
Then I would have to learn how to ice

24
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,500
skate.
It was much more exciting as a youth.

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,720
Yeah,
fucking roller.

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,250
Not Roller blading.
Fucking ice skating to green day shit

27
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:12,420
like that.
You know what I mean?

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,590
That's right.
They play loud music and you spin around

29
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:19,200
the ice.
See,

30
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,920
I guess hockey would be the reason to do
it.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,530
Like if you wanted to learn how to play
hockey,

32
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,420
you pretend you're.
You're doing hockey moves and like

33
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,340
you're on the ice.
Snowing.

34
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:33,650
When you stop and you throw the snow of
people know the right.

35
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,550
That's a cool move.
Yeah,

36
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:38,160
exactly.
So you were the hockey skates.

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,300
You definitely don't wear the figure
skating ones.

38
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,420
No chance.
No,

39
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:43,650
you don't.
What's the difference?

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,450
Well,
they had the spikes in the front,

41
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:48,900
so you could do the triple toe Lutz.
You don't want anybody to know what you

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,060
don't want anybody seeing your spikes.
Definitely.

43
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,670
Well,
you're going to.

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,130
When you go straight you have to lift it
a little bit and you're going to fall on

45
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,740
your face.
The hockey is a little curvature,

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,100
like a running shoe.
It just allows you to maneuver,

47
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,700
to dice so it allows you to maneuver
better,

48
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,850
but it doesn't allow you to do tricks.
Can't do.

49
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:12,480
You can't do a stop.
And then triple toe alerts or Lego Scott

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,750
Hamilton flip.
So are they doing flips and when they do

51
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,600
those spins on the ice they do on them
with like special skates?

52
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,860
Is that what the deal is?
Sure.

53
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,090
Brian Channel

54
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,780
and I've noticed with archery my ego,
even when I will have me shoot the Arrow

55
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:32,420
and the exact same way,
even though I'm still off the fucking

56
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,530
target,
you know,

57
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:34,161
I,
you say no,

58
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:34,551
no,
no,

59
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:38,000
you were right or wrong.
That's how the brain works.

60
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,650
Like it felt right.
Just keep doing it.

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,900
So,
so,

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,610
so you've got to.
Even though the feedback from the

63
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,391
universe like,
nope,

64
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:46,460
wrong,
don't take that approach to bud fucking

65
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:51,461
ever hurt somebody or hurt somebody.
Stops screaming.

66
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,410
I'm doing it right.
Yeah.

67
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,100
Right,
exactly.

68
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,090
But think of it man.
So I certainly am in my life,

69
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,410
have erred by choosing my instinct over
the feedback I'm getting from the

70
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:06,971
universe.
Well,

71
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,310
this is like that book that you
introduced me to,

72
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,020
which I war of art.
Now,

73
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,640
the book of five rings.
Oh,

74
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:15,850
the real one.
And the one that talks about how uh,

75
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,820
you should just learn anything like,
get good at anything.

76
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,190
It doesn't matter what the thing is that
you're getting good at it because if you

77
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,230
understand how to get good at this one
thing,

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,130
you can extrapolate from that how to get
good at almost anything.

79
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,080
There's these recurring patterns that
happen.

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,640
And so with archery it's really cool
because you have to find these.

81
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,110
You have to keep all these variables the
same no matter what your environment,

82
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,630
if you can learn to keep these variables
the same.

83
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:44,140
If you're on a hill,
the distance in wind,

84
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,910
whatever.
If you can learn how to hold these

85
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:48,430
variables the same,
which is the anchor point,

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,960
the way your arm holds the bow,
the way you pull the Arrow back,

87
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,540
the way you release the air,
there's all these pieces in there.

88
00:03:55,541 --> 00:04:00,190
And if you can keep all of those the
same or close to the same with

89
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,860
adjustments based on whatever your
target app is to be,

90
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,450
then you're going to improve in your
accurate accuracy.

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,410
If you keep changing your variable,
if you keep moving your arm up or down

92
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,690
or like releasing in a different way or
whatever.

93
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,370
If any of these things are always
changing,

94
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,700
you won't be as accurate over time.
So from that you can grab that and look

95
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,890
at your life and realize like,
Oh shit man,

96
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:26,440
my wife,
I've just been readjusting all these

97
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:31,441
stupid variables over and over and over
again without just for at least a month

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,610
attempting some rhythmic pattern.
Some similar thing,

99
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,410
you know.
And when you start doing that,

100
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:43,411
it's really interesting because you
begin to improve in a lot of,

101
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,270
in everything in general.

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,750
I mean there's,
there's arguments to anthropology that

103
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:53,560
actually they were lots of societies
that had a lot more leisure time than we

104
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,770
do,
you know,

105
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,980
hunting,
gathering societies and spending four to

106
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,140
five hours a day,
quote unquote working hunting,

107
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:03,550
gathering and had lots of time for
ceremonies and all kinds of other

108
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,170
things.
It depends on where you are in the world

109
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,580
and how harsh the conditions were,
but,

110
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,870
but the,
you know,

111
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,470
sort of the original leisure society
May,

112
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:11,940
it may have predated,
predated agriculture,

113
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,200
something they had no iphones and maybe
that was a blessing,

114
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,930
who knows,
but for five hours of hunting and

115
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:19,390
gathering is exhausting,
you know,

116
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,000
and you really don't have enough time to
develop a car.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,260
No,
no cars.

118
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,790
Yeah.
After you figured that out,

119
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,950
after you've done your hunting and
gathering,

120
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,310
then it's about cooking and.
But also there's no days off because you

121
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,500
don't have any refrigeration,
right?

122
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,140
Depending on,
depending on your climate.

123
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,560
And I mean they could,
they could try things and do certain

124
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,200
things,
but clearly,

125
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,270
clearly not a,
not a frigidaire around the corner.

126
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,760
Oh,
but you know what you're talking about

127
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:46,300
about whether it's cities or just modern
society,

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,510
that
high tech,

129
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,750
high speed world that most of us live
in,

130
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,660
where many of us don't feel like we have
much free time and we're running around

131
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,920
and doing all these things in cities.
Usually

132
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,020
when I talk to people who become hunters
as adults,

133
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,260
by and large,
that's part of why they did it.

134
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,040
They wanted to reconnect.
Yeah.

135
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,210
You know,
it's part of why they garden is part of

136
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,490
why they raise chickens.
It's part of why they do all sorts of

137
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:18,120
other things that you understand and
value to.

138
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,870
They want to get back in touch with
those.

139
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,520
Not only the hands on skills,
but just the world they inhabit.

140
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,790
You know,
beyond the domesticated concretized

141
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:33,320
city.
Concretize

142
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,390
the pavement,
you know,

143
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:41,391
beyond the pavement into nature and
whether it's a little garden patch in

144
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:46,200
your backyard or you hunting around the
Missouri breaks,

145
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:51,000
you know,
there's a sense of wanting to reconnect

146
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,160
so that all these practices,
hunting,

147
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,420
gardening,
raising chickens in part are like an

148
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,283
antidote

149
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,140
to modern life.
So do you want to.

150
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,540
You want me to tell you a bit about the
evolutionary roots of religion,

151
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,690
how,
how you would study religion as an

152
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:08,660
evolutionist.
Okay.

153
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,543
You Ready?
Yeah.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,940
So one argument is based on.
It's an adaptive argument,

155
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:15,340
right?
So the idea is if religion exists,

156
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,250
does it confer an adaptive advantage to
people?

157
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,190
And so there was some work done by a
good friend of mine,

158
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,360
David Sloan Wilson and evolutionary
biologist where he argues using the

159
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,390
groups selectionists argument that that
groups that are religious out survive

160
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:34,090
groups that are not by virtue of them
being more communal,

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,980
more cohesive,
more abandoned.

162
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,060
So that argument is an adaptive argument
for why religion exists.

163
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,110
There is another argument by other
evolutionists that is based on an

164
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,210
exaltation arguing.
Have you ever heard that term?

165
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,190
Exactly.
What does that mean?

166
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,980
So that's a byproduct of evolution.

167
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,890
In other words,
it's something that evolved not because

168
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,590
itself,
it confers an adaptive advantage,

169
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,270
but rather it's piggybacking.
So for example,

170
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,090
the fact that your skeletal system is
the color that it is,

171
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,080
that itself is not adaptive.
It is a byproduct of other evolutionary

172
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:07,360
processes.
So from that perspective,

173
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,820
religion piggybacks on computational
systems in our brains that evolved for

174
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,200
other things.
You follow me,

175
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,970
for example,
coalitional thinking,

176
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,970
the idea of viewing the world as US
versus them,

177
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,140
blue team versus team.
That is an innate part of our psychology

178
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,170
now.
Now religion piggybacks on that,

179
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,180
right?
It takes that computational system that

180
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:31,660
already exists in us and it,
it puts it on steroids,

181
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,010
right?
So you think about the Abrahamic

182
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:33,844
religions,
right?

183
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,630
Every one of them has us versus them.
They are the Jews,

184
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,460
the gentiles,
the believers,

185
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:40,450
the preferred,
right?

186
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,800
And so at agency detection detecting
agency and things is something that is

187
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,020
innate to us.

188
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,780
Religion plays on that.
The agent becomes God,

189
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,890
and so that's an argument that was
proposed by Pascal where he's basically

190
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:57,710
saying that religion not specifically
evolve because itself,

191
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,600
it is adaptive,
but it piggybacks on other things that

192
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:04,650
have evolved.
And then a third way to study a religion

193
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,870
is to just do a content analysis of the
the,

194
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,490
the narratives within religions.
So there's a great study done by a

195
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:16,491
Darwinian historian where she looked at
in the old testament how many women are

196
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:21,990
ascribed to a different male and the in
the Old Testament as a function of a

197
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:25,170
status.
So the higher the status of the male,

198
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,180
the more sexual partners you had,
which is exactly what you would predict

199
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:34,980
from an evolutionary perspective.
High status to men confers reproductive

200
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:37,320
success.
So there are different ways that

201
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,270
evolution is.
And there are several other ways that

202
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:43,020
can study religion from an evolutionary
perspective.
