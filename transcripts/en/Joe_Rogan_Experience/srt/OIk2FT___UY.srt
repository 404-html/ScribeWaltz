1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,833
Hello

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,380
bitches.
Um,

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,960
I could ice skate incredibly man.
I'm fucking again.

4
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:08,400
Ice Skating.
85.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,420
Yeah.
Have a good day.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,010
First of all,
I can't find it.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,200
Shoot when I don't have my own ice
caves,

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,200
so I have to rent ice skates.
It's for the same reason why I couldn't

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,360
a no go or years.
I can rent.

10
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,420
Those are fucking shitty.
Well it's just that my feet are too

11
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,090
wide.
So if I had a regular size 11 my feet,

12
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:29,091
I have someone in my background fucked a
monkey when it was big fucking big foot

13
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:32,580
long time ago.
Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck

14
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,070
monkeys anymore.
Someone just went back in for one more

15
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:37,700
shot,
fucked a monkey guaranteed.

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,770
It was like the last like last call
evolution last car and one of my

17
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,170
ancestors just snuck back in and got one
more nut off.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,500
Um,
but my feet are just too wide,

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,790
so I get in those things.

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm just in agony and it just never
learned how,

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,380
and I'm not going to,
I'm just not interesting enough for me

22
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,390
to go out and buy ice skates.
You know,

23
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,120
it feels like this is it.
It's just something I have to conquer

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,500
than it would have to learn how to ice
skate as much more satting as a youth.

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,690
Yeah.
Fucking roller.

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,280
Not Roller blading.
Fucking ice skating to green day shit

27
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,420
like that.
You know what I mean?

28
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,610
That's right.
They play loud music and you spin around

29
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,580
the ice.
Yeah.

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,740
See,
I guess hockey would be the reason to do

31
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,210
it.
Like if you wanted to learn how to play

32
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,590
hockey,
you say you pretend you're,

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,250
you're doing hockey moves,
you know,

34
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:31,470
like you're on the ice,
snowing when you stop and you just throw

35
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,610
the snow at people,
you know the show.

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,431
Right.
That's,

37
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,370
that's a cool move.

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,121
Yeah,
exactly.

39
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:39,450
So it's like you were the hockey skates.
You definitely don't wear the figure

40
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,870
skating ones.
Mm.

41
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,420
No chance.
No,

42
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:43,650
you don't.
What's the difference?

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,420
Well,
they have the spikes in the front,

44
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,130
so you could do the trip will tell
lunch.

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,250
You don't want anybody to let you,
you don't want anybody seeing your

46
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,650
spikes.
You're gonna.

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,410
When you go straight,
you have to lift it a little bit and

48
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,740
you're going to fall on your face to
hockey is a little curvature.

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,790
Or like a running shoe just allows you
to maneuver to dies.

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,290
So it allows you to maneuver better,
but it doesn't allow you to do tricks.

51
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,200
Can't do,
you can't do a stop and then triple til

52
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,870
lunch.
So let go Scott Hamilton flip.

53
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,830
So are they doing flips and when they do
those spins on the ice,

54
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,600
they doing them with like special
skates?

55
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,850
Is that what the deal is?
So sure.

56
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,600
Brian Boitano.
Okay.

57
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,620
And I've noticed with archery,
my ego,

58
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,820
even when I will have me shoot the on
the exact same way,

59
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,890
even though I'm still off the fucking
target,

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,000
you know,
like you say,

61
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:34,271
no,
no,

62
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,070
no,
you were right through Arrow was wrong.

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,890
That's how the brain works.
Like it fell right.

64
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,070
Just keep doing it.
So,

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,150
so,
so you've got to,

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,050
even though the feedback from the
universe is like,

67
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:44,884
nope,
wrong,

68
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,750
don't take that approach to bud fucking
ever.

69
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,810
Wow,
you hurt somebody or hurt somebody.

70
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,090
Stop screaming.
I'm doing it.

71
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:53,460
Right.
Yeah,

72
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,090
right.
Exactly.

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,200
But think of it,
man.

74
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,350
So I certainly am in my life have erred
by choosing my instinct over the

75
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,970
feedback I'm getting from the universe.
Well,

76
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,310
this is like that book that you
introduced me to,

77
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,070
which I war of art.
Now the book of five rings.

78
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,230
Oh,
the real ones and the one that talks

79
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,130
about how uh,
you should just learn anything like get

80
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,820
good at anything.

81
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,770
It doesn't matter what the thing is that
you're getting good at.

82
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,230
Because if you understand how to get
good at this one thing,

83
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,130
you can extrapolate from that how to get
good at almost anything.

84
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,080
There's these recurring patterns that
happen.

85
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,640
And so with archery it's really cool
because you have to find these,

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,140
you have to keep all these variables the
same no matter what your environment,

87
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,620
if you can learn to keep these variables
the same if you're on a hill,

88
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,530
the distance when,
whatever,

89
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,990
if you can learn how to hold these
variables the same,

90
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,950
which is the anchor point,
the way your arm holds the bow,

91
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,120
the way you pull the Arrow back,
the way you release the arrow.

92
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,020
There's all these pieces in there and if
you can keep all of those the same or

93
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:02,860
close to the same with adjustments based
on whatever your target app is to be,

94
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,450
then you're going to improve in your
accurate accuracy.

95
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,410
If you keep changing your variable,
if you keep moving your arm up or down

96
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,690
or like releasing in a different way or
whatever,

97
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,370
if any of these things are always
changing,

98
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,700
you won't be as accurate over time.
So from that you can grab that and look

99
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,890
at your life and realize like,
Oh shit man,

100
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:26,410
my wife,
I've just been readjusting all these

101
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:31,411
stupid variables over and over and over
again without just for at least a month

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,580
attempting some rhythmic patterns,
some similar thing,

103
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,410
you know,
and when you start doing that,

104
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,650
it's really interesting because you
begin to,

105
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,820
um,
improve and a lot of an in everything in

106
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:46,654
general.

107
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,720
I mean there's,
there's arguments in anthropology that

108
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:53,560
actually there were lots of societies
that had a lot more leisure time than we

109
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,740
do,
you know,

110
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,350
the hunting,
gathering societies and spend,

111
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,580
you know,
four to five hours a day,

112
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,550
quote unquote working hunting,
gathering.

113
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:01,480
And had lots of time for,
you know,

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,970
ceremonies and all kinds of other
things.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,330
It depends on where you are in the world
and how harsh to conditions were,

116
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:07,630
but,
but the,

117
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:09,280
you know,
sort of the original leisure society

118
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,740
May,
it may have predated a,

119
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,210
did agriculture.
Certainly they had no i-phones and

120
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,200
maybe,
maybe that was a blessing,

121
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,930
who knows.
But four or five hours of hunting and

122
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:19,380
gathering is exhausting,
you know,

123
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,000
and you really don't have enough time to
develop a car.

124
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,253
No,
no cars.

125
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,790
Yeah.
After you figured that out,

126
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,950
after you've gotten done,
you're hunting and gathering,

127
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,310
then it's about cooking and,
but also there's no days off because you

128
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,530
don't have any refrigeration.
Right.

129
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,380
Depending on,
you know,

130
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:34,360
depending on your climate.
I mean,

131
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:36,400
they could,
they could try things and do certain

132
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,200
things,
but clearly,

133
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,740
clearly not a,
not a frigidaire.

134
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,030
I'm around the corner.
Oh.

135
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,580
But you know what you're talking about
about whether it's cities or just modern

136
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,020
society,
that

137
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,480
high tech,
high speed world that most of us live

138
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,040
in,
where many of us don't feel like we have

139
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,500
much free time and we're running around
and doing all these things in cities.

140
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,910
Usually,
uh,

141
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,990
when I talked to people who become
hunters as adults

142
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,290
by and large,
that's part of why they did it.

143
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,820
They want it to reconnect.
Yeah.

144
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,230
It's part of why they garden.
It's part of why they raised chickens.

145
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,100
It's part of why they do all sorts of
other things that you understand and,

146
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,630
and value to.
They want to get back in touch with

147
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,780
those.
Not only the hands on skills but just

148
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,030
the world they inhabit.
You know,

149
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:32,031
beyond the domesticated concretized city
conquered types,

150
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,470
you know,
you know,

151
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,390
the pavement,
you know,

152
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:41,391
beyond the payment into nature and
whether it's a little garden patch in

153
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:46,200
your backyard or you know,
hunting around the Missouri breaks,

154
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:51,000
you know,
there's a sense of wanting to reconnect

155
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,190
so that all of these practices,
hunting,

156
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,420
gardening,
raising chickens in part are like an

157
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,283
antidote,

158
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,150
modern life.
So do you want to,

159
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:04,540
you want me to tell you a bit about the
evolutionary roots of religion,

160
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,290
how you would study religion as an
evolutionist?

161
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,153
Okay.
You Ready?

162
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,620
Yeah.
So one argument is based on,

163
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,150
it's an adaptive argument,
right?

164
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,770
So the idea is if religion exists,
does it confer an adaptive advantage to

165
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,740
people?
And so there is some work done by a good

166
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,670
friend of mine,
Dave Wilson,

167
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:24,080
Wilson and evolutionary biologists who
are,

168
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:28,780
he argues using a groups selectionists
argument that that groups that are

169
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:33,400
religious out survive groups that are
not by virtue of them being more

170
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,050
communal,
more cohesive,

171
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,920
more abandoned.
So that argument is an adaptive argument

172
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:42,460
for why religion exists.
There is another argument by other

173
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,370
evolutionists that is based on an
exaltation argument.

174
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,710
Have you ever heard that term?
Exactly.

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,190
Exactly.
What does that mean?

176
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,980
So that's a byproduct of evolution.

177
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,960
In other words,
it's something that evolved,

178
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,590
not because itself,
it confers an adaptive advantage,

179
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,270
but rather it's piggy backing.
So for example,

180
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,120
the fact that your skeletal system,
is it the color that it is,

181
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,080
that itself is not adaptive.
It is a byproduct of other evolutionary

182
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:07,390
processes.
So from that perspective,

183
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,820
religion piggy backs on computational
systems in our brains that evolved for

184
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,230
other things,
if all what I mean.

185
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,350
So for example,
coalitional thinking the idea of viewing

186
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:20,350
the world as us versus them,
the team versus red team,

187
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,770
that is an innate part of our psychology
now.

188
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,560
Now religion piggybacks on that,
right?

189
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:30,250
It takes that computational system that
already exists in us and it,

190
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,780
it puts it on steroids,
right?

191
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,490
So you thinking about the Abrahamic
religions,

192
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:36,700
right?
Every one of them has us versus them.

193
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,380
They are the Jews,
the gentiles,

194
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,120
the believers,
the Kuffar,

195
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,720
right?

196
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,620
Uh,
and so,

197
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,650
uh,
agency detection detecting agency and

198
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:47,020
things is something that is innate to
us.

199
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,810
Religion plays on that.
The agent becomes God.

200
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,030
And s.
So that's an argument that was proposed

201
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,350
by Pascal boy where he's basically
saying that religion did not

202
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,590
specifically evolve because itself,
it is adaptive,

203
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,080
but it's piggy backs on other things
that have evolved.

204
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,470
And then a third way to study religion
is to just do a content analysis of the,

205
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,390
the,
the narratives within religion.

206
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:13,680
So there's a great study done by a
Darwinian historian where she looked at

207
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:18,681
in the old testament how many women are
ascribed to a different male and the old

208
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,620
and the Old Testament as a function of a
status.

209
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,870
So the higher the status of the male,
the more sexual partners he had,

210
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,380
which is exactly what you would predict
from an evolutionary perspective.

211
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,520
High status to men confers reproductive
success.

212
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
So there are different ways that
evolution is,

213
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:42,510
and there are several other ways that
can study religion from an evolutionary

214
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,050
perspective.
