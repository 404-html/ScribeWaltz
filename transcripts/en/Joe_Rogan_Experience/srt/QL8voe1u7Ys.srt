1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,270
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,890
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,260
one.
Hey Fella.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,550
Hey,
what's going on?

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,810
Not much.
How are you?

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm good.
How are you?

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm great.
Wonderful.

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,130
We're a little fucking high ride.
We're going to get through it.

9
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm so bummed.
I was thinking about going to Hawaii the

10
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,690
other day and then his volcano happened.
I'm like,

11
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:23,680
of all the times I was there,
I.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,750
Oh,
you were there when it happened.

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,000
It was in Lanai.
I was on one of the other islands.

14
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,100
Did you feel the earthquake?
No,

15
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,440
I didn't feel it.
It's,

16
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,490
you know,
it's separated by quite a lot is a lot

17
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,780
of water and the way the big earthquake
happened actually after the plane took

18
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:39,450
off,
so we were in the air when the big one

19
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:40,284
hit.
Yeah.

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,380
Which it's apparently a big one,
like a five nine.

21
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,400
I think it was even more than that.

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,770
Was it six?
Oh,

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,550
oh,
right.

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,990
They had a big one and then they had a
fucking really big one in five night's

25
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,910
big.
I think the way it works,

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
I'm sure someone will correct me here.
I think the way it works is a five.

27
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,990
Six is like really powerful,
but a five,

28
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,070
seven is twice as powerful than a five.
Eight is twice as powerful as that.

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,930
So when you get up to seven,
like that's some world changing shit.

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,020
It's actually six point nine.
Oh my God.

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,890
That's insane.
Oh my God.

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,290
Can you imagine being on the icon?
Was that powerful?

33
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,140
That's so big.
That's such a big earthquake,

34
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,290
man.
Did you see the um,

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,980
I put it up.
It's so funny,

36
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,410
Dude.
You put up anything that's from CNN and

37
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,810
people want you to put it up from a
verifiable source.

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,090
Not Cnn.
CNN is bullshit.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,910
It's a video.
You fucking asshole.

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,190
It's a video of lava eating a car.
My stake.

41
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:40,350
CNN faked.
It was great to say I'll look to see

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,630
conclusive evidence that CNN is not full
of shit.

43
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:47,631
And then I'll go to their website.
Stupid to people are so goofy,

44
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,570
so goofy with this fake new shit.
It's lava.

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,750
It ate a car.
It happened.

46
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,370
Did you see the video?
Yeah,

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,080
the white,
the white car.

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,250
Polish it up.
I think it's good that that cards

49
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,470
forever going to be in rock.
So like when we all died in like the

50
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,600
future,
like people can like find this car,

51
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,960
the,
it's broken down to the bare elements at

52
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,840
this point,
I'm assuming it just got completely

53
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,370
melted.
I wonder.

54
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,470
They say that stuff is 2000 degrees and
it's so hot,

55
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,310
but it's molten rock.
So like if it didn't burn through your

56
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:26,370
feet or if you,
if you weren't flammable at all for some

57
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:28,050
strange reason,
you could actually walk on it.

58
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,403
I'm like,
what?

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,540
I cut thought you would just sink in it,
but no,

60
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,380
it apparently it's cooling like right
out of after it gets out of the surface.

61
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,740
Oh this is so crazy.
This is like a monster.

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,890
So we're watching this lava flow on
Hawaii's big island.

63
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:48,891
I liked how Jamie went with CBS news,
bro folk the food news.

64
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:52,560
Actually Brandon Clement got the video.
Oh powerful.

65
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,360
Brendan Clement.
But this guy,

66
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:57,390
whoever he is a bad motherfucker because
look what he was next to.

67
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,690
He was filming this.
I mean he was near this thing.

68
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,230
Oh my God.
Like imagine being on that street and

69
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,440
staying.
What kind of a crazy fuck you have to be

70
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,690
to be on that street and stay and then
it's six point nine hits during all

71
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,260
this.
That's so big.

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,920
That's such a crazy earthquake,
but they live on a volcano.

73
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:21,280
I mean,
it's one of the reasons why a lot of

74
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,050
people don't want to live on the big
island.

75
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,880
So shit like this.
Yeah,

76
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:28,390
that's splatter.
One's crazy that there's a fissure in

77
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,550
this neighborhood.
There's a subdivision out there and

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,040
something estates.
I forget what it is,

79
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,480
but they're fucking April.
Do the.

80
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,720
The,
the ground opened up in their

81
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,340
neighborhood.
I mean,

82
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,440
if you lived,
you know,

83
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,260
thousands of years ago,
this would be an angry God coming to

84
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,440
attack your village.
Could you imagine if normal days you're

85
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,930
in Hawaii,
you're in one of the most beautiful

86
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:53,050
places on the planet.
You're just chilling and the sun is

87
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:57,130
perfect and you'd seen the ocean,
you hear the seagulls and you see

88
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:01,390
dolphins and shit,
and then the ground opens up and hell

89
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:06,391
starts pouring out.
Eats your house each Mustang fuck.

90
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,920
And they were talking about it today in
the news.

91
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:10,900
They're like,
there's nothing we can do.

92
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,740
There's nothing that I can pour water
on.

93
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,220
Nope,
can't do shit.

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,080
You're not going to stop it.
It's too big.

95
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,440
They apparently stopped it from doing
something in like Iceland and they had

96
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:29,251
to use billions and billions of gallons
of water to halt the progress of the

97
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,890
lava.
I forget what it was.

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,630
That big plume was in the air and you
couldn't fly anywhere.

99
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:39,280
I believe so.
And that is also that plume being in the

100
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:43,000
air,
which restricted flying is all tied into

101
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,640
the death of that journalist.
Michael Hastings.

102
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,870
Do you know that?
Oh,

103
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,290
that crazy conspiracy theory.
It's one of the weirder ones,

104
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,940
man.
It's one of the weirder ones.

105
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,090
This guy,
Michael Hastings was this sort of

106
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:59,230
renegade journalist type character and
he went to Iraq or Afghanistan,

107
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,740
um,
I want to say Iraq,

108
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,490
but it might've been Afghanistan.
He went there with the troops and he got

109
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:11,491
stuck there because of that volcano.
So because you stuck there,

110
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,160
everybody got comfortable with him being
around.

111
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,570
They started saying crazy shit to start
joking around about Obama and stuff like

112
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:23,770
that.
And he put all this in the article and

113
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:26,650
when you put all this in the article,
that general had to resign and he was

114
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:29,860
like one of the most popular and most
powerful generals in the army.

115
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:36,030
Then shortly thereafter,
homeboy decided to go 120 miles an hour

116
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,590
down sunset and slammed into a tree and
his car exploded and everybody's like,

117
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,690
it's a fucking burger.
Hits assassination.

118
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,210
And then there was all these tech guys
that were coming out and they were

119
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,044
saying,
listen,

120
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,050
you absolutely can hack a car and change
the direction.

121
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,910
Change the,
the what,

122
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,990
what the car does take control of the
car.

123
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:58,340
You absolutely can do.
And they were like,

124
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,330
abs.
Absolutely.

125
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,610
He was like,
absolutely you can absolutely.

126
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,750
One hundred percent.
You do it.

127
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,510
Do you have.
We know these people,

128
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,620
there's videos of people falling asleep
in their Teslas,

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:07,940
right?

130
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,890
The car just drives you there.
You get on the highway,

131
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,080
just drives you.
We know that's real.

132
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,350
It turns,
it'll turn,

133
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,140
will make turns for you.
It'll park.

134
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,490
They have cars,
the park.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,870
You don't think that they can,
that they figured out a long time ago

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,270
say,
wouldn't it be cool if we could just tap

137
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:26,630
into that and make this motherfucker
drive into a tree or star kids?

138
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,150
They didn't.
They would be so incompetent that I

139
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:32,540
don't want to hear any conspiracy
theories ever again because of the

140
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,290
government didn't look at that stuff.
If the government like this assassins

141
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,990
didn't look at that angle.
Bobo Bobo.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,030
Hold on a second.
So you telling me if the head of Isis is

143
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,090
in a car and it's a Mercedes,
we can hack into that car and make that

144
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,460
motherfucker drive off a cliff.
We can do that.

145
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,960
Okay,
well let's do that

146
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,713
100 percent.

147
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,140
Those people all day of trying to figure
out a way to kill bad guys.

148
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:56,060
You don't think they would think that?
Of course they would.

149
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,960
So that's the scary thought.
But then the other possibility is

150
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,110
homeboy was losing his mind because of
the pressure,

151
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,770
which is entirely possible.
You always have to like look at

152
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:08,600
everything.
You've got to look at all sides.

153
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,190
You really do.
It's so.

154
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,220
It's so easy to just pick a side on any
story or a conspiracy theory or

155
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,970
anything,
even a political opinion,

156
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,470
so easy to just dig your heels in,
but in this one you gotta look at this

157
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:24,290
guy.
They definitely found amphetamines in

158
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,370
his system.
They said,

159
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,840
and that's not uncommon for writers.
Writers love adderall.

160
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,240
It fucking love it.
Apparently.

161
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,630
I have a friend who's a journalist,
says everybody who's a journalist is on

162
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,590
adderall.
Obviously.

163
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,450
He's exaggerating the one guy's out
there,

164
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,490
like,
no folk,

165
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,860
not fucking mood,
but um,

166
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,310
who was it that was a doctor?
Oh,

167
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,060
my friend,
Dr Roddy Mckee the,

168
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:55,040
the stem cell doctor from Vegas.
He was telling me about people that were

169
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,530
taken adderall like when he was in
college and he's like,

170
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:59,310
Holy Shit,
it's my breasts mail

171
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,620
throws me listerine strips.
Okay Dude,

172
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:06,500
I'll fucking take one.
Blindly flipped it.

173
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,840
But he was saying that Williamson
colleges like a market change in

174
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,030
everybody's performance.
Once they started doing the adderall.

175
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,970
I believe it.
Jamie gave it to me.

176
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:18,710
He gave me a little tiny piece,
allegedly.

177
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,690
Maybe not.
Maybe I just made that up officer.

178
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,910
I don't know what that was.
I don't know what the fuck that was.

179
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,480
I didn't take it either way.
I'm,

180
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,300
I'm scared of it.
I'm scared.

181
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm gonna take it and go.
Yes.

182
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,520
This is what I need.
Right.

183
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,820
Like the same,
same reason.

184
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:34,040
I would be scared of coke.
I've never fucked with coke.

185
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,530
I like coffee too much.
I like it.

186
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,060
I drink it,
but I'm not even tired.

187
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,040
I'll just look for a cup of coffee,
like come on in,

188
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,630
have a cup of coffee and be nice.
Right now I feel like I crack like

189
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,980
cracky when I'm on adderall lake as it
could get into like the whole time to

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,140
make you talk too much.

191
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,080
Uh,
I've only done like three times,

192
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,050
but I remember I tried to do it and go
on stage and it was awful.

193
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,240
I felt like I was on.
My timing was all like jeter,

194
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,931
Gdg,
gender,

195
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,800
gender.
When you got to take into account like

196
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,700
there's the way you feel before you go
onstage and it there's the way you feel

197
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,860
onstage,
the adrenaline you have to take into

198
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:06,560
account that that adrenaline is going to
be there.

199
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,950
It's kind of mix in.
Yeah.

200
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,250
I did modafinil once.
It did modafinil on stage and it was a

201
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,850
weird little balancing act.
That's that pro vigil stuff,

202
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,740
right?
It was weird.

203
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,550
It was like,
Whoa,

204
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,020
this is weird.
You know,

205
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:22,050
you better off sober.
You just put the.

206
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:27,051
The thing about those pills apparently
is he get used to it and then you get

207
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,430
used to that juice.
You know,

208
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,740
you're used to just fucking have the
energy to get shit done.

209
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,750
Come on Brian.
Let's start a fucking business.

210
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,250
Come on Brian.
Let's organize.

211
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,460
We've got to make a nonprofit that
carries the same name as

212
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,690
everybody gets super,
super fired up,

213
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,430
but you can get a lot of shit done that
way.

214
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,520
So that's the thing with journalists
apparently according to my friend,

215
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,661
he's like,
dude,

216
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,940
everybody's on it.
They're all on it and they write like

217
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,370
maniacs.
They just fucking pound the keys.

218
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,810
But it makes sense in that take your
pills documentary on Netflix.

219
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,190
That's what they talk about too.
I need to see that percent of kids in

220
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,150
high school college taking it to stick
it through.

221
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,640
Well,
I think it's a performance enhancing

222
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,140
drug.
So here's the question.

223
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,450
Is it worse than drinking?
I bet it isn't and we don't have any

224
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:15,960
problem with all those kids drinking.
The question is,

225
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,080
are they going to get addicted to it
more easily than they would get addicted

226
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:20,810
to drinking because you don't have this.

227
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,080
I mean,
I don't know,

228
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,810
but I'm assuming you don't have nearly
the same kind of hangout where right.

229
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,080
It was.
How,

230
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,070
how does it affect your liver in
comparison to like alcohol?

231
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,260
Because I think adderall and that kind
of shit.

232
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Fuck might be worse in that aspect.
I think you'd see a lot of bodies if it

233
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:39,240
were.
I think there'd be a lot of dead people.

234
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,610
I really do.
This is what I think.

235
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:45,180
I think it's one of those where's the
body's thing like where's the bodies?

236
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,010
Whereas the bodies,
you know,

237
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,370
where are they?
It might be one of those things.

238
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,700
Oh,
you don't want to do lot of buddies

239
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,940
going to have to flex and Dolly,
oh,

240
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,710
are you sure you sure everybody's
already doing it.

241
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,340
Booze,
like there was a fucking stupid article

242
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:03,000
that I was reading about the Keto Diet.
It was so dumb.

243
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,130
He was so poorly written and uninformed
because they were talking about a study

244
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:12,930
they did where they took people and they
put them on a Keto diet for four days

245
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:17,670
and their athletic performance decreased
and then they even included the caveat

246
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,390
this could possibly be because of the
Keto flu,

247
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,650
which is something that sometimes people
get when their body goes into before

248
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,130
your body goes into Ketosis,
takes a long time to switch your body

249
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:32,580
off from a lifetime,
but burning carbs to burning fat.

250
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,820
The real health benefits in athletic
performance,

251
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,821
if any all happen after your body gets
through this transitionary period,

252
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,070
so they did a study about four days of
the Diet,

253
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,200
like who gives a shit?
Why would you do that?

254
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:49,710
That's not how it works.
It takes weeks before your body even

255
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:54,711
totally transitions over and then even
then the benefits and include increased

256
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,840
rather over months.

257
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,870
Ms Dot plenty of science on this stuff,
like the people that have had on the

258
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:02,380
podcast that talked about it like Dom
D'agostino and all the studies that he's

259
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:03,410
done on it.
Uh,

260
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,830
Peter Attia,
who's on the other day,

261
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,760
he's like real scientists who are like
the,

262
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,320
the data's out there.
You could look at it.

263
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,650
It doesn't work for everybody in terms
of the benefits of it,

264
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,790
but you don't do it over four days.
Like why?

265
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,680
So they're saying it's dangerous.
Potentially dangerous dive.

266
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,300
It's fucking food.
It's not dangerous.

267
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,450
You know what's really dangerous?
Eating the same way most people eat

268
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:27,150
every day.
You know what I was while I was watching

269
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:28,810
a video with this guy from,
you know,

270
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,290
the company called Flavor God.
I've seen that.

271
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,100
It's a spice company.
He makes really delicious spices.

272
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,950
And he had this video.
He went to a store and he just picked

273
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,250
out a garlic salt,
like,

274
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,500
okay,
let's try this one right here.

275
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,350
And he picks it up and it says sugar in
it.

276
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,200
Sugars,
third ingredient in fucking garlic salt.

277
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,720
So I go home after I watched this video,
I pick up the car.

278
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:52,330
So I'm like,
that looks like the shit that I have in

279
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,920
my house.
I pick it up.

280
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,250
It's under garlic salt.
It has fucking loves sugar.

281
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:59,680
It's like the third or fourth ingredient
is sugar.

282
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,540
I'm like,
you gotta be kidding me.

283
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,570
They put sugar in garlic,
salt these monsters.

284
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,910
That's insane.
That's not right dude.

285
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,270
These monsters.
Is he selling it as a spice or is it say

286
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,930
garlic salt on it says regular.
It's a big company.

287
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:17,360
It's a green cap.
It says garlic salt.

288
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,710
His stuff is just garlic and salt and
real spices and whatever.

289
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,140
This flavor God guy.
So he's just pointing out like,

290
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:25,880
look man,
you're getting fucked over.

291
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,560
And I didn't know.
I had no idea I was pouring this dye.

292
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:31,520
Put this stuff on my eggs.
I didn't know there's sugar in it.

293
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,370
That's ridiculous.
Why would you put sugar in garlic?

294
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:35,600
Salt?
You've got the.

295
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,750
Don't call it garlic salt.
Then call it Tony Spices.

296
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,390
This is Tony Spices.
I put a little of this.

297
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,230
I put a little of that.
You know what I like?

298
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:45,320
My grandmother always put sugar in
everything.

299
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,610
Fuck it.
Sugar.

300
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,190
It seems like that should be illegal.
It should be illegal.

301
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,390
Fucking asshole.

302
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,901
Because if.
What?

303
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:54,410
If you can't have sugar,
never think to look and check every

304
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:58,240
fucking label to make sure someone's not
sneaking some sugar in on you.

305
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,940
Creepy fucks.
Speaking and creepy fucks.

306
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,820
Did you hear about that nurse who is
going to jail because she was infecting

307
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:10,490
patients with HIV,
with Hepatitis C.

308
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,490
She was infecting her hepatitis c blood
into their medication.

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,561
Why?
Well,

310
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,930
she's crazy.
She's crazy.

311
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,920
She was giving them Hep c on purpose is
what they're alleging.

312
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,700
At least here it is.
Nurse allegedly used her own drug

313
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,060
needles on patients leading to hepatitis
C infections.

314
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,240
Okay,
so I'd read it differently.

315
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,340
I'd read that she injected the
medication with her blood.

316
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:43,980
She had put her blood in the medication.
Maybe that was just a shitty article I

317
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:46,320
read,
but either way.

318
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,900
Okay,
so what they're saying is

319
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,840
she's suspicious of two counts of second
degree assault.

320
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,490
She's not been formally charged and our
mother Eunice told the media at the news

321
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,560
conference prior to that,
her daughter wouldn't hurt a bug.

322
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,260
Hmm.
So say a Washington emergency room

323
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:07,730
nurses accused of stealing narcotics and
injecting to hospital patients with Hep

324
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:11,420
c using the same needles that she used
to inject herself.

325
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,270
Okay.
So the not saying she infected it with

326
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:15,860
her blood,
their blood on purpose.

327
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,220
She just did something super
irresponsible and used her needles on

328
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:22,220
these patients.
So what she did was.

329
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,750
So what they're alleging is that she's
using narcotics and she would get too

330
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:30,980
much for the patients and give some
theirself and they use that same needle

331
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,180
to give it to the patients probably
because needles are tightly controlled

332
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,540
because they don't know.
They probably have to account for every

333
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,960
needle missing so they don't give them
the junkies and they probably have to

334
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,670
account for all the narcotics.

335
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,530
So she would probably give them some of
hers since as she intentionally

336
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,500
contaminated medicine or other substance
with her own blood.

337
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,420
See,
that's what I read.

338
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,540
See,
this is a different thing.

339
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,380
This is a different website you just
pulled out intentionally contaminated

340
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:00,740
medicine or another substance with their
own blood.

341
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,340
Then she administered the medicine,
medicine or other substance

342
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:07,490
intravenously.
So the way she did it wasn't by putting

343
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:10,550
her blood into the medication on
purpose.

344
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,330
The way she did it was by taking some of
their medication allegedly.

345
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,910
So I haven't seen any evidence that she
would have that would prove that she

346
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,110
intentionally infected anyone.
Hmm.

347
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,610
It's her attorney.
Yeah,

348
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,110
that's her attorney.
Yeah.

349
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,990
Um,
so we'll go to the top because there was

350
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,410
something about narcotics,
right?

351
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,850
I've read this.
There's a book called dead doctors don't

352
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,720
lie and it's all about this Guy Dr Joel
Wallach,

353
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:41,450
and it was all about mineral deficient
diets.

354
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:45,140
And then how many people are mineral
deficient diets because us farmlands are

355
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:47,720
just a totally overrun with,
uh,

356
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,780
you know,
you use the same land over and over and

357
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,880
over again.
They're overrun from the crops,

358
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,970
like just drained the dirt.
So they have to add minerals to the soil

359
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,010
and they have to add shit to it.
And this guy,

360
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:00,740
Dr Joel Wallach,
was talking about how you have to

361
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:05,741
realize like there's a lot of people out
there that over time mineral deficient

362
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,770
diets will show poor health results,
right?

363
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,220
So he was going on about how little
doctors know about health in general,

364
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,240
you know,
how to fix things,

365
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,840
but how little many doctors know about
like good diet and what's important,

366
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,790
what kind of nutrients really need
because they really don't spend that

367
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,640
much time in school,
much less time than the average person

368
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:26,720
who sort of obsessed with it.

369
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,380
But then he started going on about how
many doctors they find dead from

370
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:35,150
overdoses and stories about doctors that
just shot themselves up in a break room

371
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:38,900
and tie shot lock themselves up in a
bathroom and shot coke.

372
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,230
Like if they're that tired and that worn
down and they have access to coke,

373
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,070
I bet I bet a lot of them did it.
Especially when you could get.

374
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,040
If you get away with it,

375
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,070
especially if they have that liquid.
And in the hospitals they're probably

376
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:56,460
just huffing that stuff too.
They still have that liquid coat.

377
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,410
They have lidacain right.
But they have liquid.

378
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,250
What do they use the liquid coq for?
For a numbing agent.

379
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,840
Right.
Well that's what Lidocaine is.

380
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:04,980
Right?
Same thing though,

381
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,900
but I don't think a lot of king gets you
high.

382
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,320
I know this girl that used to,
I don't know if she made it,

383
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,720
but I always thought it was from a
doctor.

384
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,430
It was like an inhaler type thing and
she would just do that some or.

385
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:17,701
No,
no,

386
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:20,370
it was a nose thing.
Like a sprayed nose thing.

387
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,910
Like a flonase.
Flonase for coke.

388
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:24,950
Yeah.
And she would just do that and she would

389
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,460
like was just shoot liquid cocoa butter
smell.

390
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,740
Yeah.
Whoa.

391
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,360
That sounds better for you.
Then snort and I don't know,

392
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,820
it's like moisturizing.

393
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,530
The best way is apparently chew those
leaves.

394
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,510
You ever done that?
No,

395
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,130
I've never even seen that before.
Yeah,

396
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:43,800
the coca leaves.
That's apparently the best way,

397
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,380
but you never get that.
That's super rush.

398
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,560
It's like the difference between the
sugar that you would get from an apple

399
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,150
and the sugar you would get from some
koolaid.

400
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,060
Like you drank a gallon of coolant,
homemade koolaid.

401
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,820
We dumped extra sugar in there and stir
that bitch up.

402
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,190
Do you remember that?
How great was that?

403
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,230
Koolaid is.
Delivers your color.

404
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:07,140
What was your Goto?
I've never met a cool edit it in like

405
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,740
I never drank.
One glass of Koolaid was like,

406
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:13,370
this is bullshit.
That green one was always weird.

407
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:16,380
They're fucking great.
I loved when the big guy with the

408
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,550
pitcher burst through the wall to EU
Koolaid Cooler.

409
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:24,000
Just smash your house to give you.
He was so excited to see you and give

410
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,140
you the sugary drink.

411
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,170
It would break your fucking house.
I did.

412
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:30,580
Still around the Koolaid guy.
Is he on the.

413
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,430
On the package is still?
Yeah.

414
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,440
That'd be funny if they made them
thinner though,

415
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,320
you know,
to to like promote like no sugar or

416
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,840
something like that.
Like the change of time.

417
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,700
Get them on diet pills.
Get kool aid on the Diet pills.

418
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,230
The shot glass now had a adderall.
Adderall.

419
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,090
Adderall.
Okay.

420
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:50,190
Let's find out.
How many people die every year from

421
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,600
adderall.
Let's guess.

422
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,560
I'm going to guess I'm going to guess
less than a hundred.

423
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,740
Oh No,
no.

424
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:58,080
It's way more than that.
I'd say less than a hundred.

425
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,620
$100 in this country every year.
That's what I say.

426
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,420
I say 59 people die of adderall a year.
I'll say $21,000.

427
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,820
It would be the worst test ever on the
price is right.

428
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,920
It's just the chance you're taking.
Don't have to go that high.

429
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Go a little higher than when you got it.
All right.

430
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,730
How much have you saved?
Fifty nine people.

431
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,850
Sixty nine.
Sixty nine.

432
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,300
What do we got?
Jamie?

433
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,100
The first thing I found that said that
there were 12 deaths associated to seven

434
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,040
to 16 year old boys in the year.
Two thousand five and there's like

435
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,980
articles about sudden death and 12 kids
on adderall.

436
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,320
So just 12.
Yeah,

437
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:45,000
but that's like it's not showing for the
year.

438
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,160
I don't know why.
I think when you die on adderall,

439
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,100
they know where you live.

440
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,810
They come down,
they nuke your house,

441
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,410
that kill all the witnesses.
Nobody this money and adderall must be

442
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:56,850
through the roof.
Well,

443
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:59,230
look at what to happen to cbd.
Did you hear about this?

444
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,870
Like I bet they have,
like the medicine companies have

445
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,630
something to do with that.
They just made it a schedule one for

446
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,270
CBD.
Did they really do that?

447
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:09,640
I thought they abandoned on that.
I just read it the other day,

448
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,770
a quarter with Kratom to courtrooms.
CBD scheduled one compound.

449
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,970
Cannabinol sales only were pot legal.
Well that's just stupid cbd.

450
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,110
It's got the most minor levels of thc
and it has a definite benefits,

451
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,840
especially when you put it on as a
lotion.

452
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:36,240
That stuff feels like a court.
Appeals Court upholds cbd status as

453
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,210
controlled substance.
Well fuck you appeals court as against

454
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,620
the hemp industry also.
Right?

455
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,110
That's a huge hit to him.

456
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,390
Cross the board.
It's a huge hit to humanity.

457
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,670
It's just dumb.
That stuff's great for old ladies.

458
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:51,130
With arthritis,
it's so much better than a lot of

459
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:53,440
medications.
You can take it in so many different

460
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:56,050
forms.
You could take it as drops.

461
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,860
You could take it as a spray.
I take it as a,

462
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,700
um,
an ointment that I'll put on,

463
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:02,410
like I have a sore shoulder or some
shit.

464
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,630
You can put that stuff on.
It's fucking great.

465
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,360
I just got,
got some recently and my anytime that my

466
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:11,470
neck is sore from like laying weird or
being in a hotel with a shitty pillow,

467
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,340
I put on like two minutes,
just loosens everything up.

468
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:16,151
It's amazing.
You know what?

469
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,050
I bet it would be great for like a
massage.

470
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,490
Maybe we'd get fucked up too high.
So I'm gonna give you a massage.

471
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,690
And CBD Lotion.

472
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,720
I did it the other day and I got it in
her vagina and I thought it was gonna be

473
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:28,900
bad.
Like I was like,

474
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,280
oh maybe I shouldn't have done that.
And you know,

475
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,950
it was fine.
Oh that's good.

476
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,933
But they,
they uh,

477
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,920
this company,
cbd for life,

478
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,680
they gave me all these,
like they face lotions,

479
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,360
they have the stuff you put underneath
your eyes.

480
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:42,700
Like they have so much different kinds
of cbd stuff.

481
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,650
Yeah.
Gino gave me some blue stuff.

482
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:49,030
It's like a roll on roll on deodorant.
You put it on like a sore elbow or

483
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:49,930
something.
It's great.

484
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah.
It's doesn't do anything bad to you.

485
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,770
The fact that these assholes decided
that it'd be a good idea to make that

486
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:58,030
illegal,
so dumb.

487
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,240
If there's nothing wrong with it,
it reduces inflammation.

488
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:02,320
It's healthy.
That's it,

489
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:03,820
period.
It doesn't do anything wrong,

490
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,580
so now you can't buy it anymore.

491
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,490
By and places where it's legal,
like we could still buy it because we

492
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,720
don't live in the dark ages because a
lot of dark ages states out there.

493
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,360
Do you ever watch that show?
A live pd?

494
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,610
I think it's called.
It's one of my favorite shows,

495
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:22,600
but it's so weird watching people get
busted for like weed and you're like,

496
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,590
wait,
how old is this show?

497
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,790
Oh,
it's live right now.

498
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,620
This is happening in and Ms Dot
Karolina.

499
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,740
Yeah,
there's a bunch of spots we could still

500
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,860
get like fully arrested.
Go to jail.

501
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,140
You're a criminal Texas for pot.
Yeah,

502
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,310
Texas.
They arrested.

503
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,570
Willing.
Nelson do.

504
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,030
They pulled Willie Nelson Office.
Tour bus,

505
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,900
you know,
that's like shooting a bass and a toilet

506
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,830
bowl.
That's so dumb.

507
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,680
It's so dumb.
How could you do that?

508
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,890
National treasure man.
Assholes.

509
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,430
Of course he smokes pot.
He's a hundred and 50,000 years old.

510
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,700
He's been playing music all across this
land forever.

511
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,260
Leave the guy alone.
Let him do whatever he wants.

512
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,080
He's Willie Nelson.
I mean,

513
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,960
if you don't love Willie Nelson,
fuck you.

514
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,300
Right.
Even if you don't want to listen to the

515
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:12,210
guy's music,
you like.

516
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,711
No.
Right now,

517
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:13,570
man.
I'm in this Amanda,

518
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,960
m and m right now.
Okay.

519
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,910
I get it,
but if you're like,

520
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,110
man,
fuck Willie Nelson.

521
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,150
No,
fuck you.

522
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,370
What do you think of the Kanye Shit
going on?

523
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,600
Jamie's kept me fully informed.
He talks about every morning.

524
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,430
Jamie has got many,
many theories.

525
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:33,110
He's got one of those mind boards.
Is Housewares kept index cards leading

526
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,090
to the center?
Yeah.

527
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,900
Kanye record releases in the center and
then all these things spray out to

528
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:43,250
yeezys and and flip flops and all these
slides.

529
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,280
Slides and he's got a bunch of theories
along the way.

530
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,920
I've never heard of your theory,
but does it involve the car accident

531
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,730
that he had right before he became
popular that like,

532
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:54,940
I think he has brain damage from this
car accident,

533
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,640
that those are the people that honestly
think that he is still on.

534
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,500
He.
Sorry,

535
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,680
he said he was on opioids from a getting
a light hypo actually because a lot of

536
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:09,470
the uh,
media scrutiny on them being fat,

537
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:11,300
he said let them to go getting light
bulb,

538
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,950
which led them to having a painkiller
addiction and he was on an opioid thing

539
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:19,400
and he was very afraid when he went to
the psych hospital that he was going to

540
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,890
get killed and people are going to take
them away for all the shit he was

541
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:24,650
saying.
So he did have some issues and I think

542
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:26,570
he's publicly said he has been on some
other,

543
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,160
um,
medication.

544
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,960
So he might be on or off of it right
now.

545
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,790
Well also he should definitely run for
president then scoop.

546
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,250
I mean,
now he's in.

547
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,090
It's perfect.
It's got all the right ingredients as an

548
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,740
artist.
That's just an artist,

549
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,080
but not.
I would take cognac over trump.

550
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,820
Any data.
Here's that thing that you do.

551
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,130
You're out of your mind.
Here's that thing that you just said

552
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:48,460
though,
about the accident.

553
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,180
You know,
that's the story of Sam Kinison as well.

554
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,720
Oh yeah,
yeah.

555
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,670
Sam kinison was,
uh,

556
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,150
when he was a boy,
he apparently was like super normal kid

557
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,990
and then he got hit by a car really bad.
And um,

558
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,750
from that point on he became a different
person.

559
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,300
Kim,
wild and reckless and crazy.

560
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,930
It's the,
it's the football players get their head

561
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,020
hit
murder their wife,

562
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:14,560
Oj Simpson.
Um,

563
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,550
you know,
his doctor said that they would use that

564
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,770
as a defense.
They would consider using that as a

565
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:22,170
defense if that trial trials to happen
today.

566
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,060
One hundred percent.
It's like that other guy.

567
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:27,030
The guy ended up killing himself if had
the football player,

568
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:28,430
mark was his name.
Uh,

569
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,940
he went to jail and he hung himself.
Martino.

570
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,630
Yeah,
yeah,

571
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,061
yeah,
yeah,

572
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:33,780
yeah,
yeah.

573
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,690
Um,
Adrian,

574
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,810
what's his name?
Jamie Hernandez.

575
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,580
Aaron Hernandez.
That's right.

576
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,070
Yeah.
But they're saying that he probably

577
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,550
had that to 100 percent.
One hundred percent.

578
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,520
It's not a matter of whether or not you
have brain damage,

579
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,790
it's a matter of how much,
how much do you have and can you work

580
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:55,140
with it,
you know?

581
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,270
That's what I mean.
If you get hit in the head a lot,

582
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,890
you have brain damage.
Your brain does not want to get hit.

583
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,000
It's just not normal.
Aaron Hernandez suffered from most

584
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,550
severe ct ever found in a person his
age.

585
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,080
He's kind of like brandon shop here.
Looks like it looks like Brendan's way

586
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:16,890
more Quito right now.
Very a brain like isn't someone younger

587
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:20,220
than someone for 46 years,
like 25?

588
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,300
Yeah.
Dude,

589
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,060
I'm telling you.
There is a fucking epidemic.

590
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,300
This shit,
and it includes all sorts of people that

591
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:31,020
get their head hit.
Whether it's a bmx guys that are

592
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:34,050
constantly crashing.
When you think about how many times bmx

593
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:38,840
guy will crash in his career,
how many head head bumps he takes 'em

594
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,630
skateboarders,
notorious for doing crazy shit wiping.

595
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,420
You know what I mean?
The older you get the kind of like a pit

596
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:47,640
bull,
does it swell and it gets worse?

597
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,480
No,
no.

598
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,980
They do say though,
the damage that cumulative,

599
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,370
it's a cumulative cumulative over I
think a period of like 10 years from the

600
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:01,350
initial incident.
So like say if you have a really bad car

601
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:04,860
accident,
your brain will continue to deteriorate

602
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,040
for 10 years from the effects of that
accident.

603
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,320
Uh,
when,

604
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,310
when the guy told me that I was like,
how do you know?

605
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,870
And I don't know how they know.
I don't remember.

606
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,940
He kind of explained it,
but I was like,

607
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,920
wait,
so you mean a guy who gets knocked out?

608
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,300
We were at the fights when he was
telling me this.

609
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,060
So I'm like,
you tell me a guy who gets knocked out

610
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:23,520
today,
it's going to feel the real

611
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,800
repercussions of that knockout in 10
years.

612
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,371
He's like,
yes.

613
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,810
It's very possible.
That's the case.

614
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,900
Wow.
That's gonna take 10 years to show it's

615
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,570
full effects.
So if you see someone who's fucked up

616
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:36,840
now,
like if they've got brain damage now,

617
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,740
like as time goes on,
it's going to be like,

618
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,960
like Muhammad Ali was one of the weirder
ones because he had developed a

619
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:45,360
neurological disease.
He developed Parkinson's.

620
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,980
But there's,
there's trauma induced Parkinson's.

621
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,090
It's a lot of people try to say,
no,

622
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:50,401
no,
no,

623
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll.
He got Parkinson's.

624
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,070
It was a disease.
Yeah,

625
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,330
maybe.
But you know,

626
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:56,520
who else has Parkinson's?
Freddie Roach,

627
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,480
the boxing coach,
and he openly discusses the fact that

628
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:03,480
it's trauma induced.
He got it from his long boxing career.

629
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,350
Just because it's a brain disease
doesn't mean the brain disease didn't

630
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:09,810
come from getting the fuck beat out of
your brain.

631
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,020
I mean,
imagine if you had a game that you

632
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,360
played or people like to kick you in the
liver.

633
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,950
This is the game,
you know,

634
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:19,260
you kicked me in the liver,
I kick you in the liver and then later

635
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,110
on you develop liver cancer and people
like.

636
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:23,370
Yeah.
But he used to like to drink.

637
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,430
Oh,
he had sclerosis had nothing to do with

638
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,320
getting kicked a lot.
Oh,

639
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,910
okay.
Nothing to do.

640
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:34,911
I'm sure he has a super healthy brain
after getting pounded on for decades.

641
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,680
That's ridiculous.
That doesn't make any sense.

642
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,010
Jesus.
Yes.

643
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,500
Jesus.
Dude.

644
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,540
I have the probably the most minor of
brain damages.

645
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,040
President most minor because I stopped
when I was 21.

646
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,933
Yeah.
What's your number?

647
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,120
How many times I got hit and now I'm
eating like how many times do you think

648
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:53,230
that you like,
oh,

649
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:54,840
that did damage.
Oh,

650
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:57,430
100 percent.
There's a bunch of them.

651
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,420
There's a bunch of them that I could
think back.

652
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Getting rocked and filling my knees go
like getting punched in and then keeps

653
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,880
borrowing heaps.

654
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,660
Barring spar,
two more rounds.

655
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,610
That guy spar three rounds with another
guy.

656
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,310
He's hitting you in the face too,
like you didn't stop.

657
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,150
It was really dumb.
He'd get hit and you get rocked and you

658
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,980
didn't.
Nobody likes sat you down and go,

659
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,240
okay,
let's take the day off.

660
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,280
I know you get right back in there,
man.

661
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,130
You're fucking legs would go bang.
Let your legs would go.

662
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:29,131
When you cover up and you know people be
throwing bombs on you and you'd next day

663
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:30,630
sparring again.
Can you.

664
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,280
Is there a way to detect it?
Like at your brain scan?

665
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:35,590
So there are ways now.
There's better ways now,

666
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:37,620
but I had a limited amount of it.
I mean,

667
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:42,070
I had the real getting wrapped in the
head for me came when I tried to

668
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:46,450
transition from taekwondo to kick boxing
or doing taekwondo.

669
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:48,100
I got it.
I definitely got hit in the head for

670
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:50,590
sure,
but I didn't get hit in the head as much

671
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,540
because it's hard to kick people in the
head.

672
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,710
You definitely get hit.
I mean,

673
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,360
I don't know how many times I definitely
got hit,

674
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,240
but I never got knocked out from a head
kick butt.

675
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:02,230
I got knocked out from punches before at
least Tko Tko.

676
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,810
But when when a punch hits your face,
it's like your,

677
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,430
your legs go.
Everything shuts off.

678
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:12,700
Like if you get rocked and you,
you see like a person go down.

679
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,710
It's not that they go down like,
oh,

680
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,060
so much pain.
I have to go down.

681
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,000
No,
you get hit and everything shuts off.

682
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,030
It just goes better.
And then you feel your legs like

683
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,560
rubbery.
Trying to stand back up.

684
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,100
Did you just watch the last UFC where
Edson Barboza head kick.

685
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:30,010
Kevin Lee.
See that spinning wheel kicked him and

686
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:33,940
you see Kevin Lee's legs just go blank.
They just gave out for a second and then

687
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:38,941
he came back and
those those ones I got way more when I

688
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:43,450
was boxing.
She got way more of those like I was.

689
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,870
I was not good at boxing.
When I first got into boxing,

690
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,700
I was learning.
I was good at taekwondo,

691
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,830
but then I got into boxing.
I was not good at it.

692
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,620
I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't understand the distance.

693
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,470
Taekwondo,
you didn't punch in the face and we

694
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,450
punched the body so you had a real
distorted perception of how good you

695
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,700
were with your hands.
And then once I started boxing I was

696
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:01,534
like,
Ooh,

697
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,800
this is terrible.

698
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,900
That's what I was taking like probably
the most damage of my life of a period

699
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:12,910
of like two years of like a lot of
sparring,

700
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,320
did a lot of sparring.
Everybody's sparred everybody's bar with

701
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:19,600
everybody.
People knocked people out all the time.

702
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,250
This is stupid.
So stupid.

703
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,880
I see guys get knocked out.
I mean out cold,

704
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,980
right hand to the chin,
boom.

705
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,170
Eyes rolled behind their head.
Legs give out,

706
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,950
they bounce off the canvas,
they put a cold towel on him,

707
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,560
they put some ice on his head.
He gets out and he's like,

708
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:39,171
I'm good.
I'm good.

709
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm good.
You want to keep going?

710
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,053
Yeah,
let's keep going.

711
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,420
Let's keep going.
Now you would just unconscious you just

712
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,200
unconscious five minutes ago and you
want to keep spar and this is crazy.

713
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:49,910
And they let him,
they let him keep spar.

714
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,440
You did it from when you were like
really young,

715
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:52,010
right.

716
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,790
Taekwondo from when I was wide took
karate classes when I was 14,

717
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:00,791
but when I got super serious I was 15.
I was like right at my before my

718
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,580
sophomore year of high school.
So like I got into it from the time I

719
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:09,140
was in the uh,
ninth grade as I was 14.

720
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,650
Like that summer,
like right after my birthday around is

721
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:17,060
when I started getting into.
So it was probably either 14 or just

722
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,000
turning 15.
Asked like was there a point you could

723
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:24,350
tell where people actually could be able
to knock people out and give that damage

724
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:27,230
because there may be 14 year olds could
knock you out a little time here.

725
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,110
The thing about kicks is almost anybody
can knock you out.

726
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,440
It's really crazy.
Like when you think of the amount of

727
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:37,040
power that you have to have in your
legs.

728
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:40,970
Let's say if you decide to put a heavy
backpack on like one of those

729
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,720
outdoorsmen atlas trainers and put 90
pounds on,

730
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,880
you could walk up flights of stairs.

731
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,610
Dude,
just think of how much power that is in

732
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,640
your legs.
You could throw your body up,

733
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:57,641
flights of stairs for exercise just to
boost your body is whatever you way

734
00:33:58,011 --> 00:33:59,150
1:50,
200,

735
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:02,990
whatever you way your body's just
launching that through the air over and

736
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:06,740
over and over again.
Even if you're a girl that weighs 135

737
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:10,310
pounds,
you're still launching 135 pounds

738
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:12,740
through the air,
and if that girl fucking shins,

739
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:17,741
you both hang right on your temple.
It goes across the jaw temple area.

740
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:21,830
Got Blind,
your legs are going to give out,

741
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,380
your brain's going to shut off if
somebody hits you.

742
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:26,890
Perfect.
There's a video of A.

743
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,810
I think the guy was she,
I think it was,

744
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,290
I think it was mighty Mo.
Mighty mo,

745
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:38,291
who's this huge kickboxer I believe he
was samoan and I mean just like typical

746
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:45,590
simone dude,
big giant fucking powerhouse of a dude.

747
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:50,000
And he fought his little thai guy.
This thai guy was 175 pounds,

748
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,390
so Much smaller than them.
I mean it was crazy to watch and tie

749
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,250
guys just we went away and moving away
and moving away.

750
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,190
And then the thai guy roundhouse kicks
hiM in the head.

751
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:00,590
This guy like,
look at the difference in size.

752
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,010
Yeah.
And watch this.

753
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,850
This dude just comes over the top.
I mean the difference between the two of

754
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:11,900
them.
Mighty mo is a beast to seriously

755
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,960
dangerous knockout puncher.
He put a lot of guys to sleep,

756
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,560
so not as this guy in there with someone
way bigger than him,

757
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:22,770
but he's in there with a killer.
But look at that one head kick and

758
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,600
mighty most down and out.
The back that up again because that is a

759
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:29,230
crazy thing to watch.
You're talking about a guy who might

760
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:32,760
have been a hundred pounds lighter than
him and mighty mole.

761
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:35,570
It's just a vicious puncher.
Bang.

762
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:38,010
You just clanged them right in the head.
That's what I'm talking about.

763
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,000
Girl.
Does that to you?

764
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,060
Night night son.
I was thinking more like 2:10 year olds

765
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,800
like no,
knock each other out.

766
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,090
That's a good point because the thought
process is that if you teach kids

767
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,740
technique,
don't teach them.

768
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,890
They just go in these wild fucking
haymaker exchanges,

769
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:56,430
but teach them how to do it correctly.
It's good to do it when they're young

770
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:58,800
because they don't hurt each other
because they have little tiny arms and

771
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,950
they just kind of touch each other and
they can't really generate knockout

772
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,150
power.
They just sort of.

773
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,780
If they learn how to do that from the
beginning and then develop knockout

774
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:11,340
power and the pads and on the bag,
then you develop much more technically

775
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:13,620
proficient fighters rather than
brawlers.

776
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,600
So the problem with fighting is like
most people don't fight to the physical

777
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:20,500
ability of their body.
Like they,

778
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:24,210
they just,
they decide they're going to knock thiS

779
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,850
guy out,
I'm gonna try to hit him with this and

780
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,590
they think in this real limited sort of
linear,

781
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,800
aggressive,
like almost obvious manner.

782
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and then you got guys who see past that
who take thIngs to a new place.

783
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,740
You got guys who,
who figure out that you can be like

784
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:45,741
really elusive and confusing and then
you see those guys fight like limited

785
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,220
blocky,
like obvious fighters.

786
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,360
and like anderson silva and his prime is
a perfect example that anderson was an

787
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,950
artist.
I mean he would just,

788
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,550
he would,
you didn't know what he was going to do.

789
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,430
Its study you.
He'd be moving around,

790
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,070
maybe be standing in front of you.
He'd be dancing.

791
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,640
He just be following you around.
And then all of a sudden he just say,

792
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:09,540
I got this motherfucker figured out.
He would just move in on your bank and

793
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,370
you didn't know what was coming.
Flying knee.

794
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:14,280
You didn't know what was coming.
Roundhouse kick front kick to the face.

795
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,080
He didn't know what the fuck was coming,
man.

796
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,030
It was a totally different kind of
fighter,

797
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,890
so the difference between that and a guy
was just like a powerhouse of a person

798
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,620
and can knock guys out,
but never,

799
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,210
never achieves this sort of mastery of
space and distance.

800
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,360
They win fights through brawling and
power and just kinetic brute force

801
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:40,590
rather than artistry and avoidance and
countering like conor mcgregor,

802
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,960
one knocked out josé aldo.
Perfect example.

803
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,890
All those like fuck you charge and
connor slides back,

804
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,560
bop drops a fucking left hand on the
button,

805
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,140
pop up and he's the champ champ.
I mean,

806
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:54,750
come on champ.
Then became the champ champ champion

807
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,760
that,
that,

808
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,380
you know,
that thing is,

809
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,570
it's hard to figure out.
Sometimes guys just decided to it rather

810
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,870
bite down your mouthpiece and let the
fucking chips flying.

811
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,530
It's not fun as part of that and have a
fight just like the last 30 seconds,

812
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,750
30 seconds,
and I just throw it out like crazy

813
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,490
because they know there's no more time
left.

814
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,301
Yeah,
they just try to.

815
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:17,640
When I try to try to stop it.
Yeah,

816
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,720
some of those fights are awesome.

817
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,420
Look as a,
as a person watching those things are

818
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,550
awesome.
There's two different parts.

819
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,700
The way I look at fights,
like I love a good diego sanchez,

820
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:30,870
gilbert melendez fight where they just
fucking go crazy for three rounds.

821
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,450
I loved that.
ThAt was one of my favorite fights ever,

822
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,900
but I also love real technical fights
where I see,

823
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,130
I see like two artists trying to solve
each other's riddle,

824
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,020
trying to figure each other out.
You know,

825
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,470
like luke rockhold versus yoel romero.
Was that like yolo?

826
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,610
Just trying to figure him out,
trying to figure him out.

827
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,960
Maybe I move like this and then boom
drops that left hand on them.

828
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,390
Same thing with him versus chris
weidman.

829
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,690
He just moving around.
It's hard to figure out what he's going

830
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:03,010
to do.
Hard to figure out what's coming and

831
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:06,130
then wome flying knee To the chin or to
the head.

832
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,300
He's a.
He's a great example of a guy just

833
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,760
figures out how to break your rhythm and
figure it through rather than just

834
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,770
running a.
Because clash,

835
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,970
clash,
clash.

836
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,670
You know,
frank mir was jusT talking about that

837
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:22,210
fate or fight and he was saying That his
ego got the best of them.

838
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,400
Did you see the fight?
It's really good.

839
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:28,600
Fight really crazy until feta or keto
them fade or cut on with the lefthand

840
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,990
and dropped it and put them away.
But before fate or k owed him,

841
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,120
frank mir had hit fate or and it got
interesting in the very beginning

842
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,340
seconds of the fight,
but then fate or hit him with a

843
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,120
perfectly timed hip throw,
just fucking boom.

844
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,360
I mean sent him flying through the air
and slammed him to the ground.

845
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,080
And apparently frank said from that
moment on his ego got the best of me

846
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:53,710
trying to get them back and then he
wound up just getting this crazy brawl

847
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,820
and getting knocked out.

848
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,930
It's really fighting to me.
So it's so interesting.

849
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,880
You know,
it's just so interesting when you see

850
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:03,850
all the different things that people can
do and how they're going to match up

851
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,220
together and how,
what one person's going to be able to

852
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:10,060
figure out how to get their,
their ideas through my ideas.

853
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,410
I want to kick this motherfucker in the
head.

854
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,030
How can I do this?
I've got to figure out how to get there

855
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,220
and his ideas.
I want to take this guy down and punch

856
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,620
his fucking face in.
How do I figure out how to do this?

857
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,740
And then the two of them are just like
trying each other's strat and you don't

858
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:22,150
really know.
You don't fucking know.

859
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:23,920
You don't know until they get in there.
For the most part

860
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,373
its greatest shit ever.

861
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,710
Have they with the judging?
Have they ever tried like I'm sharing in

862
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:34,360
between rounds what the scores are so
you don't have to guess it was through

863
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,130
rocks that those people.
What if they don't say who it is or they

864
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:40,500
don't have to be a bad idea?
They killed them all just by being

865
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:41,820
associated.
What if they weren't there?

866
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:43,560
What if they're like in the back room or
oh,

867
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:45,110
that's even worse.
Why aren't you there?

868
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,710
Maybe the judging would be better if
they were there.

869
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,740
They have to be there
in person judging.

870
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,010
They're actually elevated.
They're a little higher than everybody

871
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:58,260
else too.
They're looking at it like above me

872
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,060
because it would have like when there's
a,

873
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,830
when the accident happening on the other
side of the octagon,

874
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:03,990
you can't see anything,
so I know they didn't get a monitor,

875
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:06,250
but like if they should,
what's the point being we can't.

876
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,480
We gotta make sure they got monitors.
They didn't get monitors in the

877
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,770
beginning.
In the olden days they didn't have

878
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,600
monitors and I,
I was going crazy.

879
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,720
I was like,
how is it that I,

880
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,000
a person who has no effect whatsoever on
the score of this fight?

881
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,370
I have a monitor I can ask for for
replay.

882
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,180
I have all this shit at my disposal.
I have,

883
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,080
I have earphones on with a microphone
and I could press the truck.

884
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:26,160
I go,
can I see that again?

885
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,440
And they'll show it to me on the screen.
LIke guys,

886
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:31,980
his ankle broke and so the production,
like sometimes during a fight we'll tell

887
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:32,761
them,
hey joe,

888
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,760
we got head,
but it was a head but that caused that

889
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,140
cut.
And then I'll say,

890
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:37,670
okay,
I'm just hearing from the truck now that

891
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,320
it was a head button.
We're going to show you that as soon as

892
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:41,240
we can,
but I'm watching it on the screen right

893
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:43,580
there.
Why can't the judges get that?

894
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,020
How long ago did that change?
It seems like they should have been in

895
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:48,140
table one.
It wasn't that long ago.

896
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,940
Wow.
I don't think the judges have access to

897
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,730
replays though.
They can't call up a replay like I can.

898
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,220
Why not?
They shouldn't be able to.

899
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,190
Should be able to have a little bit too
much time to judge or think about it or

900
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,300
no,
you need to know things.

901
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,790
You need to know things.
Like if a guy gets kicked in the balls,

902
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:01,780
was that a real kick in the balls?

903
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,030
Watch after the after the fact because I
just said you don't want their attention

904
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:08,390
taken from what's going on.
The action depends on replay.

905
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,920
Depends.
Yeah.

906
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,880
I mean I think it should just be an
option for something's up.

907
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,390
Like what happened there?
Did he get rocked or did he fall on his

908
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:18,740
ankle?
You know what I'm saying?

909
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,530
Like what happened there?
And there's only one way to tell.

910
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:23,510
Sometimes you got to see it again
because he that again,

911
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:24,530
please.
They should be able to say,

912
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:25,460
can I see that again,
please?

913
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,110
That would be as I said,
yeah.

914
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,750
Well they.
They have instant replays now,

915
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,000
which is interesting.
Like say if a guy pokes the guy in the

916
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:34,460
eye and the judge wants to call for an
instant replay,

917
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,960
but once they instituted the instant
replay in some states the fight is over.

918
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,540
That's so great.
That doesn't make any sense.

919
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,820
So if I say no instant replay,
I'll just take this.

920
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:45,770
I poke and keep fighting.
That's okay,

921
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,220
but if you want to look at it on video,
the fights over what?

922
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,050
I compare it to the mba,
which I watch a lot,

923
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:54,540
they go to the replay a lot,
which is a little annoying as a viewer,

924
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,340
but they're.
They're trying to get it right,

925
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,280
which they have a team of people in New
York where they're watching all the.

926
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,370
All the angles.
They can pull up anything they want.

927
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,010
They can see anything that they take as
much time as they need to.

928
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:07,620
Sometimes it takes five minutes,
but why not do that with fighting?

929
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,513
They get it right.
You know?

930
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,950
Common sense.
Why doesn't that exist?

931
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:14,650
It should definitely exist and I mean we
talked about it with Michael Chandler

932
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:15,760
yesterday.
There should be more.

933
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,230
Judges.
Definitely shouldn't be.

934
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,430
Only three judges.
That's.

935
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,290
It's ridiculous.
It doesn't make any sense.

936
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,120
There's no reason to limit it to three
judges.

937
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,510
I bet you would get far more competent,
far more knowledgeable judges for free

938
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,410
than you would even if you paid them.
Just pull up their fucking twitter cap,

939
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,200
blow the twitter account up.
They'll judge you for free to so many

940
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,620
mma fans out there that would love to
judge fights and they actually

941
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:41,380
understand fighting.
They really get it and they love it.

942
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:45,070
They're not just doing it because it's a
job and they used to do boxing and you

943
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:48,490
know this is a good way to make 1500
bucks on a saturday night or whatever

944
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:50,920
they met.
That's not what they're doing it because

945
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:51,760
they actually love it.

946
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,530
So many people,
but do it.

947
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,290
It will be way better.
You can definitely judge from home too.

948
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,510
We could definitely should have,
I mean why not have like an online

949
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:05,770
scorecard as well?
Like why not have that as an option so

950
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:08,560
the ufc could let everybody know how bad
the judges are.

951
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,870
I mean I'm not saying that everybody
online is going to know what the fuck

952
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:16,430
they're talking about,
but enough people online you going to

953
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:18,190
know what they're talking about where
it'll balance out.

954
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,490
So if you had just like 10 judges and
then the online judges have an online

955
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:25,300
store

956
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,150
work card.
If you pay for five pasture where you

957
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,830
probably are willing to have some
knowledge on the sport,

958
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,210
but also it put it in the app.

959
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,450
Say like conor fight unknown ob,
you know,

960
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,470
they're all the conor fans are going to
vote for him anyway.

961
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,580
Balance out because unknown bob will
probably have some fans too and then

962
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:45,000
people will be a bunch of haters.
They're hoping that connor failed

963
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,390
because he's got a limousine and bypass.
You got paid for your vote.

964
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:50,250
In that case,
you want to pay 10 bucks every time.

965
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,600
Yeah,
exactly.

966
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,640
Will you.
If you had an app,

967
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,730
you have a ufc app and the app,
all it has to do,

968
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:59,790
they just make it so it's interactive.
So with each fight,

969
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,520
after the fights over,
you click winner or loser,

970
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,340
you know that's all you have to do just
quick winter and you.

971
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:07,620
If you are optional,
you could put in your own score,

972
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,140
but the fuck out of here,
the scoring sucks anyway.

973
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,480
That 10 point must system stupid.

974
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,880
It's,
it's a borrowed system.

975
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,160
It's not a good system for all those
weapons.

976
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,200
It's a good system for two,
two weapons,

977
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,280
punches,
kicks and knees and elbows,

978
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,440
chokes,
takedowns defense.

979
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,770
You've got slams and throws and come on,
we'll kicks and spinning back kick.

980
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,170
What's better?
Spinning back kick or a jab

981
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,210
in boxing is a punch or a punch.
Like that punch was harder than that

982
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:41,670
punch,
but unless someone's kicking you in the

983
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:42,930
leg,
you don't even know what that feels

984
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:43,920
like.
You have no idea.

985
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,810
Guys just walking around like nothing
happened.

986
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,450
You can't score that.
If nobody's ever kicked you in the legs,

987
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:53,690
they should have a full body suit that
detects punches and that like how strong

988
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,330
it is within.
It takes away from the fucking.

989
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,220
The rawness of it all.
You can't have people fighting in body

990
00:46:00,221 --> 00:46:01,260
suits.
One of the future.

991
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,790
It will look like you don't have
anything on.

992
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:06,840
A lot of gals have to where the weather
is something that covers their

993
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:08,280
midsection,
right?

994
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:12,780
They have like a sports bra strap down,
sort of jammy and they wear something

995
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:15,090
that covers her midsection to.
That's interesting.

996
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,180
Like they have to have their stomach
covered or they're allowed to have their

997
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:23,181
stomach covered just to keep their boobs
and check like everybody got to stay in

998
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:25,380
the party.
Can't fuck up those titties.

999
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,760
Cats and gone.
We'll be on soon.

1000
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,210
She'll explain it to us because she had
a wardrobe malfunction.

1001
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,850
One of her fights.
Really just a little snip at the docs

1002
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,340
can
skip steps

1003
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:44,040
in that funny.
Every dude shows his nipple every due to

1004
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:46,500
fights shows his nipple girl goes out
and shows her nipple.

1005
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:48,270
Everybody goes crazy.
It's funny.

1006
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,720
Twitch,
twitch won't even let a grown man take

1007
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:54,920
off his shirt stand.
Keep your clothes on.

1008
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,030
You freak.
People are always like,

1009
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,860
why don't you broadcast on twitch?
Because I,

1010
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:00,990
if I can get banned for just showing a
nipple.

1011
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:01,740
What else?
I mean,

1012
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,290
anything a man can get banned.
Like bert kreischer,

1013
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,860
if he tried to do the berg cast on
twitch,

1014
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,800
which it immediately be a band.
He could maybe talk to them and they

1015
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:12,060
might be able to.
But most people,

1016
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:14,450
yeah,
it's against the guidelines to show skin

1017
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,180
looks a lot of those things.
That's the only problem with twitter

1018
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:19,710
that you forget.
It's made for babies.

1019
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,180
So silly.
You can't show man boobs.

1020
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,740
Yeah,
it's pretty readable.

1021
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,830
You're super flat chested with you take
your shirt off and you just smooth.

1022
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,170
I just don't want people taking their
shirts off there.

1023
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,700
Okay.
what if you take your shirt off and you

1024
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:34,690
have like pastries on.

1025
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,720
I do have people that do body paint,
so there is a little bit of

1026
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,450
body paints.
Okay.

1027
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,650
So if you decide to do like,
um,

1028
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,470
the british flag,
paint that over your body,

1029
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,700
that's okay.
But you just can't be no paint

1030
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,150
strip clubs in columbus,
Ohio.

1031
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:57,390
The ones that serve alcohol,
they can't even show their tits.

1032
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:00,920
They have to paste all these days,
but they have pastries that look like

1033
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,230
better areolas,
you know?

1034
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,900
Oh,
I'm going to have these nice darker ones

1035
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,430
like fake patients.
Whoa.

1036
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,330
Wow.
That's sick body pains.

1037
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:11,380
Pretty cool when it's done.
Right.

1038
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,930
That is incredible.
That's really good.

1039
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:14,830
Go back to that again.

1040
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,213
Yeah,

1041
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,180
that's neat.
There's a couple of them missing this.

1042
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,460
She's doing this character on the side
here.

1043
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,130
Right.
But that's all her really.

1044
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,080
I'm pretty sure.
Wow.

1045
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,330
Well,
she's definitely got some kind of a boob

1046
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:31,400
pad going on.
Wow,

1047
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:34,520
that's amazing.
Some people are really good tour self.

1048
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,620
Have you ever seen the girl I saw on
instagram where she will like,

1049
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,960
will paint her eyes like up here and
then have like a fake nose and a fake

1050
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:46,780
mouth and it looks like a completely
different face and then she opens her

1051
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,100
realize you're like,
well that's that.

1052
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,830
That's
her name though.

1053
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,710
Yeah.
This is basically you're looking at

1054
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:56,140
naked boobs.
They're just got paint on them.

1055
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,780
So we let it slide.
So is this this girl's thing?

1056
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,770
She just gets her boobs painted and it
goes onto.

1057
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,750
Oh my god,
she does.

1058
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,210
That's her thing.
That is hilarious.

1059
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,880
That's great.
That's a way that you could see the

1060
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,680
whole thing.
Girls are trying to figure out this

1061
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:10,510
dress.
It's just not tight enough.

1062
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,040
It's not revealing enough.

1063
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,540
There were some girls that were playing
games on twitch just in like a bikini or

1064
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:17,070
whatnot and they got in trouble for
that.

1065
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:19,980
So they hAd to take their scheme over to
youtube or some other sites.

1066
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:25,190
How long before someone comes up with a
nontoxic paint that girls can paint all

1067
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:29,360
over their body and it's like a thin
nylon layer and they'll go ouT and

1068
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:32,060
you'll see everything.
So you know there's going to be a few

1069
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:35,030
girls that just go for it.
Like this deadpool here,

1070
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,810
naked deadpool girl.
Like how there's going to be girls like

1071
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:40,430
that that just go for it.

1072
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,290
My favorite is if you google a twitch
girl desert,

1073
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:50,800
realize camera's still on after show and
masturbates.

1074
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,870
Is it telling you got busted,
fallen for that?

1075
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:58,480
Come on,
you have all thought looked really real.

1076
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,760
You just,
you just dream real.

1077
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,570
You it to be real.
That's ridiculous.

1078
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,990
Call bullshit on every call.
Bullshit.

1079
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,050
So it's like a well known girl that did
it.

1080
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,913
No.
Right.

1081
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,860
Direct you on instagram.
What's your name?

1082
00:50:13,861 --> 00:50:16,140
Mary?
Nine zero four five.

1083
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,580
And did you say hello dear?

1084
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,941
Well,
no,

1085
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:21,390
I mean look,
there was no reason why it was like a

1086
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:23,480
bad,
like she was half off the camera.

1087
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,110
Like it looked like it wasn't that her
sister would do it.

1088
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:30,570
If I was going to fake something,
wouldn't you figure it out?

1089
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,090
Right?
Come on son.

1090
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,260
How dare you?
Just sad,

1091
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,780
sad that you got roped into that.
I feel less of,

1092
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:41,090
you know,
iT's the first time it's happened,

1093
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:42,470
joe.
I,

1094
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,490
there's so many scams is too easy to get
the new one.

1095
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:48,410
I almost got scammed the other day.
They do want,

1096
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:51,050
I don't know what's going on lately with
a robo calls,

1097
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,630
but I'm,
I'm getting a call almost every day.

1098
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:55,490
like this is the iris.
We are,

1099
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:57,160
you need to contact us now.
And,

1100
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,900
or this is a t and t you need to,
uh,

1101
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,340
we need to talk to you about your
billing.

1102
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,110
Please enter your credit card info right
now.

1103
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,520
You'd like,
did they call you when you're high?

1104
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,750
Nonstop?
No,

1105
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,793
but,
uh,

1106
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,150
it,
it's interesting because,

1107
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:09,770
uh,
like I think t mobile does it.

1108
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:12,410
How does your phone come up now?
It just a scam.

1109
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:17,411
Likely like t mobile is now filtering
out these calls and it's telling me if

1110
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:19,620
it's a scam like him.
Yeah,

1111
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,340
I like that.
Are you going gonna be cool and say

1112
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,630
murder spray that,
uh,

1113
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,820
as the rest of the world that sort of
gets online.

1114
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,940
Like for instance,
like parts of africa that aren't online

1115
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:32,780
now will be online eventually that the
scams will switch back.

1116
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:36,050
Like the nigerian prince scam will be
american scamming.

1117
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,710
People in africa just get on because
they don't know about the scams yet

1118
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:40,670
because they haven't been a part of it.

1119
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,610
Oh my god.
I don't know if that really happened

1120
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,570
with that.
Like some theories,

1121
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,480
that's not a bad theory,
but those people were really good at

1122
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:51,530
scamming lonely people.
There was such a sad show I was watching

1123
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:54,820
once about this old guy,
I think the guy's daughter was like

1124
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,910
trying to like tell him that this girl
wasn't real and he kept going to england

1125
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:00,920
for.
We went to europe twice,

1126
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,410
um,
to meet her and both times something

1127
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,740
came up and she couldn't meet him.
Then he went back again and he keeps

1128
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:09,260
sending her money.
He's been sending her money,

1129
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:11,180
sent her,
I want to say like a quarter million

1130
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:14,660
dollars.
And his daughter was like,

1131
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:16,160
it's not written.
You could see the guy like,

1132
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,940
like they're filming them and talking to
him and he had this look in his eye like

1133
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,370
he was hoping the wrong,
but thinking they might be right.

1134
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:25,610
Like he was going insane.
He was going insane from loneliness.

1135
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,570
Sad.
I see it everyday on the web cam sites.

1136
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,330
There's guys that every single day I go
there,

1137
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,530
the same guys there and he's spending
money nonstop all day long and he's just

1138
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:39,020
on there all day.
He might spend like thousands of dollars

1139
00:52:39,021 --> 00:52:39,490
a day.

1140
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:43,210
How billion dollar internet scam is
breaking hearts and bank accounts,

1141
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,250
criminal networks,
defraud,

1142
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:49,210
lonely people around the world with
false promises of love and romance.

1143
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,150
You know,
you could analyze this from a lot of

1144
00:52:55,151 --> 00:52:56,620
ways,
like it's predatory behavior.

1145
00:52:56,621 --> 00:53:00,070
I caught a coYote in my yard last night
was predatory behavior,

1146
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,080
right?
It's going to have human coyotes.

1147
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,150
You're Always going to.
I didn't catch him,

1148
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,470
catch him,
catch him.

1149
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:08,110
I just chased them out of my yard to try
and get my chickens.

1150
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:12,820
But this is a predatory behavior on a
weak person,

1151
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:18,010
you know,
so I can see it's on one hand I feel

1152
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,640
upset that they would go after these
people,

1153
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:23,470
these lonely people.
But on the other hand that's fascinating

1154
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:28,471
to me was like,
what a drug people's love is what a drug

1155
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:34,041
that is like how important it is that
people like find people that care about

1156
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,440
them,
that like them and care about them.

1157
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:40,440
IT's so important when you don't have
that in your life,

1158
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:45,441
you just feel so empty and it's one of
probably the most major sources of like

1159
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,260
bad feelings in people,
so they just don't have anybody that

1160
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:54,720
loves them.
They don't get what good friends,

1161
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:57,900
they don't have,
they don't have good people around them

1162
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,860
and they just sad.
Just sad to the point where someone

1163
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:05,790
comes along,
we can help you.

1164
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,250
Come on,
come over here.

1165
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:13,160
We've got girls.
Girls would want to meet you.

1166
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,210
Curls in your town,
girls sign up.

1167
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:22,110
You can meet girls like rules,
you know?

1168
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:24,180
It's like someone,
someone offering you food.

1169
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,270
Facebook's new online dating service
won't have ads.

1170
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,940
I thought that said won't have

1171
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:32,300
aids,
aids and that's what I said.

1172
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,760
It was like,
what the fuck are they saying?

1173
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,310
It sounds like that'll take advantage of
what you're talking about right now.

1174
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,120
Online dating service won't have ads so.
But it will have russians all russians

1175
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:46,960
all the time.
Well,

1176
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,490
I mean it'd be nice if people could just
meet people in the real world.

1177
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:54,130
ThIs meeting people online stuff.

1178
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,500
It's so weird how,
like I talked to people that use tinder,

1179
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,830
they hooked up on tinder like weekly and
there's a lot of these people that

1180
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,910
that's all they do.
They'll just fuck people on tinder all

1181
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,860
day.
It just makes you wonder how many people

1182
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:10,380
just do that.
Like all data women and she's already

1183
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:13,950
been fucked like seven times for the
same

1184
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,410
app.
You know,

1185
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:18,180
like all these people are just like,
they're just like,

1186
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,730
you're taking extreme risks.
Yeah.

1187
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,490
With your bed.
there was,

1188
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,630
there was the

1189
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,990
second thing where they wanted to do
online dating apps.

1190
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,800
Like someone was saying,
should online dating apps be responsible

1191
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,500
for the increase in sexually transmitted
diseases?

1192
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,790
Should they be responsible?
Like as if they have some obligation to

1193
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:41,540
tell you to wear rubber.
Oh fucking stupid.

1194
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:44,540
That is like soMe,
they have some obligation.

1195
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,650
They're like,
you know,

1196
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:46,910
like look,
you know,

1197
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:48,590
these poor little children are go
fucking.

1198
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,470
He needed to tell them they need to
protect theMselves.

1199
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:56,090
Like these adults wrote adults using an
app.

1200
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,950
Tinder and grindr don't want to talk
about their role in rising stds.

1201
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,200
Good.
Why do you want to talk to them?

1202
00:56:03,201 --> 00:56:04,700
You muck raking piece of shit.

1203
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,540
They don't have a role.
They connect people together.

1204
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,660
People make their own decisions.
You've got to be responsible for your

1205
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:16,940
own actions,
especially when it comes to something

1206
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:18,140
like that.
That's crazy.

1207
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,740
And you know,
the other part is like the demonization

1208
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:24,760
of sex is a part of this,
or what about tinder and grindr?

1209
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,370
What are you doing here?
All these people is just having sex and

1210
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:29,050
getting stds.
you're responsible.

1211
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,780
What about your part?
What about your role?

1212
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,060
Your kid out outta here.
That's ridiculous.

1213
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,160
That's ridiculous.
Do bars have a role in liver sclerosis?

1214
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:43,530
Should they pay people out?
Should they be financially responsible?

1215
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,470
They're literally selling you the shit
that kills you and they have zero

1216
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:51,400
responsibility as long as they don't
serve you while you're drunk and driving

1217
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,140
along as they cut you off in time and
said,

1218
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:53,890
hey,
you got to drag.

1219
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:54,490
We cut him off.

1220
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,660
Alright,
sounds drug.

1221
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,010
They literally sell you the stuff that
does it to you and no one cares as they

1222
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:01,480
should.
No one should care.

1223
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:04,420
You're fucking grown adult.
Does grindr,

1224
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:08,950
those dudes banging each other all day?
Do you think that anyone's going to stop

1225
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:10,170
that?
Oh,

1226
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,840
I shouldn't connect these people.
You should make money connecting them.

1227
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,440
You shouldn't give them the opportunity
to do exactly what they want as grown

1228
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,300
adults with a limited about of time on
earth.

1229
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,000
Get 90 years.
If you're lucky,

1230
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,230
if you want to spend 45 of tHem raw dog
and dudes,

1231
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,830
you go,
you go boy,

1232
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,250
who gives a shit?
Are they respond?

1233
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,860
They don't want to talk about their
responsibilities.

1234
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:39,861
Shut the fuck up babies
now.

1235
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:44,000
That very upset about something that was
new to me,

1236
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,200
especially grinder now that backpage has
closed,

1237
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:50,110
like all these websites are closing.
It's very interesting to see what

1238
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:53,460
happens next where people are going to
find their hookups and stuff.

1239
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,100
Well,
yeah.

1240
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,690
That was what I was reading this thing
where sex workers are in danger because

1241
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:00,850
of this,
because before they used to be able to

1242
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:05,851
vet customers and then customers would
have like a record of using other sex

1243
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:09,640
workers and they could know who the
psychos were,

1244
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,320
who to avoid.
You know what I mean?

1245
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:16,980
And they could also screened people like
actively screen.

1246
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,460
They could do,
they could do all this.

1247
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,590
they were saying,
I was reading an article about it where

1248
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:24,010
this girl who remember if they gave her
name out or not,

1249
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:26,560
but she was.
She worked in a brothel and she was

1250
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:30,300
talking about it and it's like,
what?

1251
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,380
Why are they doing this?
Like is there,

1252
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,050
is it because of a crime?
what's the crime?

1253
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:38,080
So if they get together like through
tinder or grindr,

1254
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,130
that's fine because that's two people
that decided to have sex,

1255
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,330
but as long as they're grown adults and
one person just wants to get paid and

1256
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:47,800
the other person's like,
well I'll pay you.

1257
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,030
And they go,
okay,

1258
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,210
fine.
Like what?

1259
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,230
Why is that illegal?
Like we're not talking about sex

1260
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:56,770
trafficking for children.
We're not talking about slavery.

1261
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,800
Were just talking about just let's just
look at it from the cleanest

1262
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:03,340
perspective.
Possible grown adult who likes sex,

1263
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,910
decides she wants to work in a brothel.
Is that possible?

1264
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,540
Is it possible for you to do that?
Like for it to be a grown adult who

1265
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:13,540
actually enjoys it?
Does have any problem with it decides

1266
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:14,860
that it's better than working at
wendy's?

1267
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,560
Isn't that?
Is that possible?

1268
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:19,720
I mean,
the people don't want to say it.

1269
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,460
Nobody wants to say that it's possible.
Nobody wants to ever look at it that

1270
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:25,280
way.
The war on sex workers needs to stop

1271
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:26,180
now.
Rolling stone.

1272
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,463
Yeah.

1273
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:35,230
It's.
It just seems like a dumb thing to chase

1274
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:37,750
down.
I mean,

1275
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:40,360
I think if people want to have sex with
each other,

1276
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,630
nobody has a problem with it,
but if people want to pay people to have

1277
00:59:43,631 --> 00:59:45,370
sex,
then it's a problem.

1278
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,270
That seems so crazy.
Again,

1279
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,740
we're not talking about child slavery.
We're not talking about sex slaves.

1280
00:59:53,741 --> 00:59:55,960
We're not talking about anything against
anybody's will.

1281
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,540
We're just talking about people who
would choose to do that.

1282
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,780
Like why not?
And I've always used this example,

1283
01:00:01,781 --> 01:00:02,920
but it's a good example.
Why?

1284
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:07,480
Why is it okay for me to get a massage?
it's okay for me to pay someone to give

1285
01:00:07,481 --> 01:00:10,450
me pleasure all over my body except my
genitals.

1286
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,600
Like they could ruB my neck and my feet.
They can get it all.

1287
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:14,860
All been my feet,
man.

1288
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,720
They get those thumbs and start working
your feet.

1289
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,210
Uh,
they crack your toe pop.

1290
01:00:19,211 --> 01:00:21,190
Pop.
It feels great.

1291
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,080
That's fine,
but they can't jerk you off.

1292
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,480
They jerked you off.
That'd be a terrible sin against god.

1293
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:27,940
And man,
if they touched your penis,

1294
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:29,530
which feels really good when you touch
it,

1295
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:33,460
can't do that.
I know a dude who said he gets asked

1296
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,350
whole massages.

1297
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,530
Yeah.
That actually happens all the time to be

1298
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,220
terrier of your asshole.
They massage the interior of your

1299
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,610
asshole.
That's okay because it's just a massage.

1300
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,010
Prostate massage with weird is when they
do it and they don't ask you because

1301
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,950
there's a lot of massage.
People just do it.

1302
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:52,900
That's a part of the massage and they
just started.

1303
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:53,741
Yep.
No,

1304
01:00:53,741 --> 01:00:54,600
no,
no.

1305
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,503
I don't want that.

1306
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:59,140
Apparently some people get it,
whether they use a tool and they

1307
01:00:59,141 --> 01:01:04,141
actually go in side.
Your ass hole rubbed down.

1308
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:04,631
No,
no,

1309
01:01:04,631 --> 01:01:05,464
no.
That's that tool.

1310
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:08,380
The other one,
you're fis,

1311
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,550
fis,
they use some sort of a thing to fucking

1312
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,480
check your,
but that's okay.

1313
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:17,530
That's fine.
That's fine.

1314
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:19,750
Just don't touch the dick.
If you touch the dick,

1315
01:01:19,751 --> 01:01:22,480
it's goddamn crime.
They're waiting outside the door with a

1316
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:23,950
pistol.
you just let me know when he touches the

1317
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,430
dick.
He's just rubbing his asshole.

1318
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,680
Check the books,
so.

1319
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,090
All right.
Oh,

1320
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,030
it's not even hard.
Okay.

1321
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,680
Okay.
we're ready.

1322
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,050
We're ready.
We're going to break it.

1323
01:01:34,051 --> 01:01:37,360
This fucking shady place.
Soon as we find out that he's dick

1324
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:41,410
touched like you could get someone to
just massage your asshole.

1325
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:45,190
JusT get in there with squeeze your butt
cheeks and get two thumbs in your ass

1326
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,770
on.
Am I doing?

1327
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,870
I'm doing a sphincter massage.
It's very important to release some of

1328
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:51,790
the shock rose and negative energy and,
and,

1329
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:55,470
and some of the toxins that are stored
in your body from processed foods and a

1330
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,120
modern lifestyle.
So we're just going into your asshole.

1331
01:01:58,121 --> 01:02:02,740
But to dump some guru talked people into
filming them in the ass.

1332
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,090
So weird that I've never.
Like I just recently found out all that

1333
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:08,770
shit that's happening in massage
parlors,

1334
01:02:08,771 --> 01:02:09,580
but like,
you know,

1335
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,400
10 years ago I had no clue.
I would go buy a massage part and go,

1336
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,630
oh,
that's of massages.

1337
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:17,410
There's nothing bad going on here.
I wonder how many places like that are

1338
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:18,400
like,
like psychics,

1339
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,010
what happens at psychics at four in the

1340
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,210
morning?
Why are they open at four in the

1341
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:22,710
morning?
Because that where you get your ass eat

1342
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:24,570
and out and I.
You don't learn about that until you're

1343
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:27,150
70 or something.
I don't think so.

1344
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:31,510
Think psychics are open late at night
because a,

1345
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,340
it's a scam and be when people are,
it's late at night.

1346
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:38,190
They're drunk and like maybe it's the
girls driving home.

1347
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:41,550
The guy texted her and she doesn't know.
Should I text him back?

1348
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,790
Why is he texted me so late?
That's kind of disrespectful.

1349
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:49,530
I don't know if he's the one that she
pulls into that psychic's office and

1350
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:52,650
she's like,
I just need you to tell me about my

1351
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:57,651
future and the psychic because like I
sense there's a problem and romantic

1352
01:02:58,261 --> 01:02:59,640
interest.
My boyfriend.

1353
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,290
Yes.
Yes.

1354
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:05,160
There's your stressed.
There's something deeply troubling you.

1355
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,023
Your,

1356
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:08,980
you're confused.
I am confused.

1357
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:10,420
Yes.
You're confused.

1358
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:14,980
You trying to the decisions hard to
something coming up.

1359
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:17,110
Something's happening.
Can you ask me to come over to the house

1360
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:19,870
and fuck it?
Yes.

1361
01:03:19,871 --> 01:03:22,210
That's it.
There's a thing that he's wanting you to

1362
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:22,601
do.
The.

1363
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:25,480
You're not so sure if he's the one.
Is that a yes?

1364
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,420
Oh my god.
That's what I said when I was on the way

1365
01:03:28,421 --> 01:03:30,820
over here.
And then when he said,

1366
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,650
you're not sure if he's the one.
I'm like,

1367
01:03:32,651 --> 01:03:36,070
oh my fucking god.
Is it like written on my forehead?

1368
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:38,110
How's it possible?
He knows.

1369
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:42,610
He fucking knew about mark.
He knew about our relationship problems

1370
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:47,140
and he knew that I was on my way over
there wondering whether or not he's the

1371
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:47,800
one.

1372
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,330
Yeah,
I don't think he's still.

1373
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,040
I think you're my favorite girl voice
guy.

1374
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:57,183
You know,
like I,

1375
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,200
you fucking asshole
and all this bullshit with.

1376
01:04:06,591 --> 01:04:11,591
I'm trying to figure out how this
fucking psychic knows the one for me.

1377
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:13,783
Who does this?

1378
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:15,870
No,
she,

1379
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,063
no

1380
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,530
friend of mine went to one.
It's like he knew my grandmother's home.

1381
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,110
Everything about my relationship.
My grandmother.

1382
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:24,220
I go,
don't you know,

1383
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,540
don't you know everything about your
relationship with your grandmother.

1384
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,000
What the fuck you want?
Do you want to pay people to tell you

1385
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:32,970
shit you already knew it's 4:00,
4:00.

1386
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,980
You're fucking nuts.
I'm wearing a watch.

1387
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,960
Uh oh.
My brains out.

1388
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:39,130
You get wet.
Oh,

1389
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,080
this guy's crazy.
tell me all this shit.

1390
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:42,910
I already knew.
It's crazy.

1391
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:45,130
I bet.
I bet it's psychics are way better now

1392
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,730
nowadays because of technology and like
they probably have like little earpiece

1393
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:51,160
in,
some guy in the back like looking at

1394
01:04:51,161 --> 01:04:53,740
their license plate number online and
finding out where they live,

1395
01:04:53,741 --> 01:04:56,020
you know,
like the and just feeding the person

1396
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:58,210
information.
I bet psychic are killer now.

1397
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:02,500
I bet there's some probablY they're like
super high scammy level

1398
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,240
because you want to repeat customer,
so if you're that accurate habit,

1399
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:10,420
there's a huge scam that that is a crazy
thing if you're driving,

1400
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:14,440
if you're driving to burbank or some
shit every couple miles to see one of

1401
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:18,070
those psychic reader places.
Five in the morning

1402
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,220
open big hand on the front,
like a hand job place.

1403
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,120
But it's a psychic.

1404
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:27,390
I went to one once when I was in New
York and I was going to these fucking

1405
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:32,560
stupid auditions.
I did not want to act and I was going,

1406
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,890
I was just wasn't what I was interested
in doing,

1407
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,080
but like your agency would tell you,
well,

1408
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:39,280
you know,
you really should look into this and

1409
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:42,880
you'll see what it was.
It was like some role that not only was

1410
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:46,700
I not going to get it,
but I want it like this is like,

1411
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:49,000
it's not even funny.
It's like super serious.

1412
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:49,691
Yeah,
but you should do it.

1413
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:50,830
So they just,
they know,

1414
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,990
they know what.
You could do commercials that go in and

1415
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,050
read for commercials and I'd be like,
what the fuck am I doing?

1416
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,990
So I left one of them and I was terrible
at it too.

1417
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:01,990
It was terrible auditioning.
And then I went to this,

1418
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:06,340
um,
I went to this psychic and I'm like,

1419
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:06,881
well,
fuck it.

1420
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:08,950
Let's say it's only like,
I don't remember how much it was,

1421
01:06:08,951 --> 01:06:10,000
like five bucks,
10 bucks.

1422
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:12,670
She's like,
you don't get along with your brothers.

1423
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,340
I go,
I don't have any

1424
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:17,020
brother's shit.
I left her,

1425
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,460
you don't know anything like looked in
her eyes and she looked at it,

1426
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:24,330
me and I knew that.
She knew that.

1427
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:29,220
I knew she was full of shit.
I knew she was full of shit.

1428
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:30,720
I looked at her.
I don't have any brothers.

1429
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:32,230
She was like,
oh shit.

1430
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:33,990
I got crazy.
She got gangster.

1431
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,140
She took a swing.
Just like sensing brothers from this

1432
01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:40,950
asshole could chip on the shoulder.
Shoulder brothers probably beat them up.

1433
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,860
no,
it came from a bad audition.

1434
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:44,993
You missed it.

1435
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,210
It's weird how we all know it's bullshit
for the most part.

1436
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:51,780
There may be some weirdo that actually
can do some shit,

1437
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,000
but like,
but we still accept it.

1438
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,790
People still go to it even though they
know deep down like,

1439
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,470
hey,
we have a gun to your head right now.

1440
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:01,350
Is this real?
If you do the wrong answer,

1441
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,360
then we're going to blow your head off.
Everyone's back.

1442
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:03,990
No,
it's not real.

1443
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:07,140
Even the people that believe psychics
the most are going to say,

1444
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,220
no,
it's not real.

1445
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,710
What did you say?
most likely if it comes to a bullet in

1446
01:07:10,711 --> 01:07:11,400
the head,
right,

1447
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,030
so like,
but we still do it like or crystals.

1448
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,650
Oh no,
these crystals are healing me.

1449
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:17,820
oh yeah.
Gun to the head.

1450
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:20,340
Do you think they're really healing?
Do you think this rock is healing?

1451
01:07:20,341 --> 01:07:21,490
You know?
No.

1452
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,040
You know,
no one's goIng to say yes.

1453
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,210
Well here's the.

1454
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:28,620
But those crystals,
those magnet things and all that shit.

1455
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,740
That one weird thing is the placebo
effect.

1456
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:35,160
Placebo effect is real.
It's very real.

1457
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:38,790
Do you remember those holograms that
people were wearing for awhile on those

1458
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:40,470
rubber bracelets?
Yeah.

1459
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,570
Brody has like four of them.
Dude.

1460
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,840
There was world class ufc fighters that
were wearing those stupid fucking things

1461
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,900
like top of the food chain assassins and
they were like,

1462
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,561
dude,
I'm telling you.

1463
01:07:52,561 --> 01:07:53,970
It's been helping my elbow.
Like,

1464
01:07:53,971 --> 01:07:58,110
what the fuck are you talking about?
And I talked to one of the guys.

1465
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,670
Goldberg was wearing one for awhile.
My buddy mike goldberg was wearing one.

1466
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,241
I was like,
dude,

1467
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:04,260
I don't think that's real.
I was like,

1468
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:05,850
you don't think I go,
I don't think so.

1469
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,350
He's like,
you want to meet with the guys who are

1470
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:08,184
making a girl?
Okay.

1471
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:12,830
I met with the guys who make it and they
try to do one of those a strength test

1472
01:08:12,831 --> 01:08:13,710
things on you,
like,

1473
01:08:13,711 --> 01:08:14,610
here's what I want you to do.

1474
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,490
I'm to.
I'm going to put this rubber band on

1475
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:18,440
you.
I want you to put your arms straight out

1476
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:21,860
and I'm going to push down on it,
and they're like halfway push down.

1477
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,320
This is one of those things.
It's like,

1478
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:26,750
okay,
I'm trying to lift your arm up,

1479
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,480
and they're like,
push down on your hand and then go,

1480
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,140
okay,
now we'll put this rubber bracelet on

1481
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:31,640
you.
Now try to lift your arm up like,

1482
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,800
wow,
this is crazy.

1483
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:36,530
I can lift my arm up because you weren't
holding it back.

1484
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,650
You're not a machine.
Like you could regulate how much force

1485
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:40,181
you're putting a.
Yeah,

1486
01:08:40,181 --> 01:08:41,220
I know what you're doing.
I go,

1487
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:43,700
this is a goddamn carnival trick.
So I said to the guy,

1488
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:45,140
go,
this is the goddamn carnival trick.

1489
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,510
And goldberg was like,
is this fake?

1490
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,380
I,
it's fake.

1491
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,821
It's fake.
I go,

1492
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:50,631
what is this?
I go,

1493
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,090
you tell me how this works.
You have a piece of plastic,

1494
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,950
but you're telling me I'm going to put
on a rubber band.

1495
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:56,630
It's going to make me stronger,
dude.

1496
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,240
Okay.
I didn't spend a lot of time in school,

1497
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,870
but I spent enough.
Fuck you.

1498
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,850
You can't do a hologram inside a
hologram.

1499
01:09:04,851 --> 01:09:06,680
Anyway.
Life is a hologram.

1500
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:08,560
You can't.
It's all hog.

1501
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,520
That's true.
They don't even exist.

1502
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,354
That's true.

1503
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,970
There's certain things that make you
think it might be a hologram,

1504
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,110
right?
Power scam.

1505
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,640
That's it.
Power bounce.

1506
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:21,240
Admits the wristbands or scam or wait a
minute.

1507
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,230
No way,
bro.

1508
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:27,210
We admit that there's no credible
scientific evidence that supports our

1509
01:09:27,211 --> 01:09:30,870
claims and therefore we engage in
misleading conduct.

1510
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:34,620
Yeah.
I called that shit out in like 2001.

1511
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:36,360
I was like,
what are you guys doing?

1512
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,640
Like what is this?
Who's wearing that?

1513
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,650
Why you weren't?
Why would you think that would work?

1514
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,950
They had to published that in australian
media.

1515
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:46,260
Yeah,
because Australia is fucking smarter

1516
01:09:46,261 --> 01:09:51,150
than us
because of their bogus claims and pseudo

1517
01:09:51,151 --> 01:09:54,150
scientific mumbo jumbo,
but this seems to be the first time in

1518
01:09:54,151 --> 01:09:57,690
which a regulatory authority has made
them admit their claims are simply a

1519
01:09:57,691 --> 01:10:02,691
fraud derp look,
there's some shit that makes you strong,

1520
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:06,960
but it's not a rubber band with a piece
of plastic attached to it.

1521
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,950
It cbd oil,
you know,

1522
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,290
I mean,
you want something that makes you feel

1523
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:12,650
better.
Cbd oils real well,

1524
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,680
trying to make that illegal.

1525
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,110
There is some,
uh,

1526
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,990
some people that say that there's no
scientific proof that cbd,

1527
01:10:19,991 --> 01:10:22,380
even eggs works at that.
it's always,

1528
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,360
it's always the other ingredients that
are mixed with the cbd,

1529
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:27,670
you know,
like they'll take the same ingredients

1530
01:10:27,671 --> 01:10:30,220
that's in bengay and then put cbd in it
also.

1531
01:10:30,221 --> 01:10:32,260
And they say,
doesn't this feel numb now?

1532
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,240
Like there's a lot of,
there's no real.

1533
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,950
I heard that there was no real concrete
evidence that cbd because there's no

1534
01:10:38,951 --> 01:10:39,420
test.

1535
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,210
I thought there was evidence that a
decreased inflammation.

1536
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,270
Isn't there evidence that a decreased
inflammation?

1537
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,120
The problem is the scientific studies,
all these things.

1538
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,820
It might be,
I might be mind fucking myself when I

1539
01:10:50,821 --> 01:10:53,190
put that stuff on.
You might seem to work though,

1540
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:57,930
especially for my elbow tendinitis.
I feel like it works.

1541
01:10:57,931 --> 01:11:00,540
Finally getting over dude.
I finally could do chin ups.

1542
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:02,790
I couldn't do champs for months.
Months.

1543
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:03,920
Try years.
Joe

1544
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,910
up with this.
It'll help get cBd in it.

1545
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,640
Um,
I,

1546
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,800
I really,
I was,

1547
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:15,330
I was not doing chin ups or anything
heavy.

1548
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,560
I was doing mostlY running and yoga for
months because of this fucking elbow

1549
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:22,020
I've,
I've never had tendinitis before.

1550
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:24,420
I've had muscle poles and stuff and
injuries.

1551
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:29,270
I never had tendinitis this and this was
a dumb one because I meet,

1552
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,760
headed my way through it.
I need headed it into a bad place.

1553
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:34,120
I go to like,
don't be a pussy,

1554
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:38,640
just keep working out.
And then it got real bad and then it

1555
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,710
until I did a bunch of different stuff
to it.

1556
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:45,711
I did stem cells and regena keen,
but the thing that helped them also

1557
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,040
this,
this rubber thing.

1558
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:48,163
Oh,
is that roller?

1559
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,291
No,
it's not.

1560
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:50,550
It's called a,
a therm.

1561
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:52,800
a band.
I've Talked about this so many times

1562
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:55,470
that I can't therabands rather.
I can't buy them on amazon anymore.

1563
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:57,930
People have bought them out,
but I'm glad because they work.

1564
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,730
If you have a.
It's cheap too.

1565
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:02,010
It's just,
it's just a piece of rubber and if you

1566
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:04,560
don't have this and you have something
that can do a similar exercise,

1567
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:07,290
it'll probably help too,
but what you do is you twist it and then

1568
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:08,124
in the release,

1569
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:09,843
hm.

1570
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,160
Twisted.
Yeah.

1571
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:15,480
You twist this thing and in the elite
you like to twist it with your hand like

1572
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:17,970
this and then the release with the right
hand,

1573
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:19,830
the right.
My right elbow is one that was injured

1574
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,110
and just slowly letting it down.
It works.

1575
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:23,280
This part of your arm.
Oh,

1576
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:25,620
that's weird way.
So even thouGh it's injured,

1577
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:27,300
it doesn't hurt it,
but it strengthens it.

1578
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,560
That's great.
It works a lot,

1579
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:31,560
so I'll just pick this fucker up and do
it 10 times,

1580
01:12:31,561 --> 01:12:34,360
12 times,
15 times and do it several times a day

1581
01:12:34,361 --> 01:12:37,440
and I made a big difference man.
Like right away I coulD feel it just.

1582
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,430
It feels like everything around.
It's like strengthened and stabilized

1583
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:45,270
and it just started feeling better
because you're putting a load on it and

1584
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:48,030
then you make an it release the load
instead of like pulling it in the

1585
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,800
direction that you injured it.
You're,

1586
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:53,010
you're strengthening it in the,
I guess would be the eccentric way.

1587
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,660
East centric.
Essentra quit.

1588
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:56,933
Hm.
So there you go.

1589
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,150
Don't get tendinitis.
Kids.

1590
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:03,080
I had recently from I think using cell
phones too much and computers too much,

1591
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:05,170
like carpal tunnel to the point where my
hand hurt.

1592
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:07,900
Like I think it's the same shit.
It's repetitive stress.

1593
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,793
Yeah.
Right.

1594
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:12,610
Secretaries get that right from a lot of
typing and stuff.

1595
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:14,890
Hairstylists also get it a lot.
Yeah.

1596
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:17,260
Um,
and I know a tattoo artist and has it.

1597
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:20,500
Yeah.
And it right now just me even saying it,

1598
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,090
I'm like,
it's still actually really sore.

1599
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,490
My hands go to guys who get it in their
risk too.

1600
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,560
And um,
you know,

1601
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,920
for a lot of those guys they start
getting addicted to antiinflammatories

1602
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:32,680
and know different things to try.
Because if you have to use your fingers

1603
01:13:32,681 --> 01:13:35,770
for work,
imagine if you had to do something with

1604
01:13:35,771 --> 01:13:38,470
your hands like that for work and you
started feeling that pain.

1605
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,050
Like this is just my elbow,
you know?

1606
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:44,770
I meaN I can do pretty much everything.
But your hands,

1607
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,420
like if it's in your hands,
fuck,

1608
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:47,254
that's a bitch.

1609
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:52,040
I was reading this article about
replacing body parts.

1610
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,190
They were talking about all the
different body parts that are on the

1611
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:58,340
verge of being able to replace.
He dId a face transplant,

1612
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,850
didn't they?
They've done a few of those things.

1613
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,693
Yeah.
Yeah.

1614
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:02,840
They did a few dick transplants.
Cock and balls.

1615
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:04,970
Yep.
here's the thing.

1616
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:08,060
If they can't do the balls,
who wants the balls?

1617
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:11,200
You don't need them.
But here's no.

1618
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,030
But here's the thing for ethical
reasons,

1619
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:16,960
because the dead person's sperm will
always be in those balls.

1620
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,480
So here's the thing.
Say if you,

1621
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,840
if you took my balls,
if I died and you took my balls and put

1622
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:24,340
them into your body and they started
having kids,

1623
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:27,160
those would be my kids.
They would have my genes.

1624
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,520
You can have my come inside of your body
growing.

1625
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,130
You got,
oh,

1626
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,560
you're going to make my own comp.

1627
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,690
You could,
but that's the crazy thing you could

1628
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:35,524
make.
Jamie's come.

1629
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:38,810
Jamie died and he donated his cock and
balls and you took his boy.

1630
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,420
Put in your body.
You.

1631
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,970
He would grow your company.
My company?

1632
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:44,840
Yes.
Come.

1633
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,860
It's his.
It's your balls.

1634
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:50,260
So it's your sperm and your come you
your ges.

1635
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:53,020
Let's just call it tj's,
but for scientific purposes,

1636
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:56,680
what happens if I have one of your balls
and went to jamie's follows what

1637
01:14:56,681 --> 01:14:57,630
happens.
So I have a.

1638
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,370
We have a fucking crap shoot.
Who the hell that kids can be?

1639
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:05,500
I have gay friends that took.
They had a kid through a surrogate and

1640
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,660
they took their common.
Just mixed it up like a swirly.

1641
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:08,800
I like.
Let's see,

1642
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,760
let's see who wins the race.
know they don't really.

1643
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:16,210
They don't really know who won the race.
This cute kid.

1644
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:19,270
He's a great kid,
but they don't know who won that race

1645
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,830
guard that they have their guests
guesses.

1646
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:26,770
I read there's a agender baby situation
going on potentially with one of their

1647
01:15:26,771 --> 01:15:31,771
bodyguards are still on the mom with the
most recent kid is an obama at the baby

1648
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:34,020
daddy is saying,
you need to get it checked because he's

1649
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:39,060
a famous rapper.
Looks like his bodyguard.

1650
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,180
Oh shiT.
I bet those bodyguards get in there.

1651
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,590
Of course they do.
They probably ripped.

1652
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,140
Yeah,
wasn't there a big thing about kylie?

1653
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:49,850
she has a sexy bodyguard.
Dude.

1654
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,970
Looks so you send it.
God damn Bruce Lee movie,

1655
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:55,520
right?
They all have to sleep with the body.

1656
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,150
What are you talking about?
You have this guy that's just works out

1657
01:15:58,151 --> 01:15:59,710
all the time.
Some bastard.

1658
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,930
Kelly.
Jamie's bodyguard.

1659
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:03,970
cryptically responds to baby daddy
rumors.

1660
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:04,804
Okay,
I'm out.

1661
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:06,550
I can't do this anymore.
I can't.

1662
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:09,550
Can't do it anymore.
Can't do it anymore.

1663
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:11,080
he's a handsome fellow.
that bodyguard.

1664
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,700
I wouldn't blame the gal happened before
though currently.

1665
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:16,120
Hey,
what are you going to do?

1666
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:16,960
Not that I'm.
I don't know.

1667
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,870
What are you going to do?
Would just like to remind everybody

1668
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:22,690
we're in space and Hawaii is exploding.
Okay.

1669
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,630
If you really give a fuck,
if you really give a fuck which

1670
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:27,220
bodyguard and who's getting the dick
into,

1671
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:28,690
which poor,
confused young lady,

1672
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,530
things are gonna happen that way,
man.

1673
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,753
Things going to happen.

1674
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,840
talking about those body parts.
I was gonna ask if you heard about what

1675
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:37,000
happened to huey lewis recently.

1676
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:39,700
I've been hearing these got some sort of
inner ear infection.

1677
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,100
he's got many years and he most
recently,

1678
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,960
very recently he was on tour.
I saw people that were like had been to

1679
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:47,720
his concerts,
but he said he can hear people talking

1680
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,070
like he was doing an interview with the
woman.

1681
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,330
He said,
I can hear your voice,

1682
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:53,690
but I can't hear music.
And like that's what he does is

1683
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,310
performed.
It's pretty fucked up man.

1684
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,110
Like ears.
Shit is really scary.

1685
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,840
My friend,
he's an editor and one day he just woke

1686
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:04,310
up and he can't hear out of his left ear
and he still to this day,

1687
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,770
10 years later,
it's still can't hear out of his left.

1688
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:08,880
You didn't happen to me.
I'm pretty sure I have tonight.

1689
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:09,714
It's bad now.

1690
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,230
Whoa.
What's tinnitus ringing?

1691
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:13,790
That happens.
I'm used to been a heavy metal band,

1692
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:18,350
so like I never wore earplugs and gone
to tons of concerts for like five plus

1693
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:21,580
years every other night.
Like the cameras down.

1694
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:22,730
That's like.
Yeah.

1695
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:23,520
Yeah,
just to see.

1696
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,220
Occasionally just go real high and I
like,

1697
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:29,060
I can't hear anything out of that year
and it's sort of like plug it up or do

1698
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,880
something and it'll go away eventually,
but some more recently it's taken a

1699
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:34,250
little longer to go away.
I have that sometimes it's usually when

1700
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:36,260
it's really quiet and I'll just come out
of nowhere.

1701
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:39,530
I hear this like ringing,
but it's not like every day.

1702
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,613
Yeah,
that's what it is though.

1703
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,780
It's called the.
Yeah.

1704
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,890
How do you get it?
It's just an old too.

1705
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,040
It's just hearing loss,
hearing loss

1706
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,680
be.
You've heard loud things,

1707
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:52,140
you've been the concerts over the years
that damage,

1708
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:55,080
but the real thing I think is people
around guns a lot.

1709
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,860
I know a lot of people who are around
guns a lot as a kid,

1710
01:17:58,861 --> 01:18:02,310
like they shot those clays with shotguns
and shoot those.

1711
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:05,760
John dudley has real bad hearing loss
from that.

1712
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:09,450
Nobody ever Told kids back then that
they need to wear ear muffs,

1713
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,410
like nobody wore ear protection.
They would go to the range with just no

1714
01:18:13,411 --> 01:18:14,244
earmuffs on,

1715
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,061
bang,
bang,

1716
01:18:15,061 --> 01:18:19,020
bang concerts.
I don't think I had growing up.

1717
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:21,870
I ever even thought of that.
Like I would sit right next to the

1718
01:18:21,871 --> 01:18:24,960
speaker on purpose.
Like I had a nine inch nail concert just

1719
01:18:24,961 --> 01:18:25,880
because like,
oh man,

1720
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,260
you know,
you're no one talked about that.

1721
01:18:28,261 --> 01:18:28,980
in fact,
that's true

1722
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:31,420
nicholas.
Wow,

1723
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:37,210
that's crazy.
You see if you can find video of them in

1724
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:42,190
a gun range with no ear protection
because I don't think I'm making that

1725
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:44,260
up.
I think I remember look watching people

1726
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:47,530
on a range to shooting guns with no
earplugs

1727
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,500
nowadays.
It doesn't matter that because their

1728
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:52,750
hearing aids nowadays,
it's like you have earbuds in now and

1729
01:18:52,751 --> 01:18:54,850
you get bluetooth to your phone and
everything.

1730
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,700
It's cool.
I want to hear hearing aids.

1731
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,010
Well,
they have those things called game ears.

1732
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:06,460
You can put them in your hearing in your
ear canal rather like a hearing aid and

1733
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:12,821
they amplify sounds extraordinarily.
And hunters use them in the woods.

1734
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:15,950
They put them in and you can see the
column game is,

1735
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,570
I think it's called a walker.
His game here.

1736
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,700
I put it on before it freaked me out.
Took it right off.

1737
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:21,280
That's crazy.
I don't even want to hear this.

1738
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,460
You're looking for.
Exactly,

1739
01:19:22,461 --> 01:19:25,100
but this guy is trying to tell people
how to do it and he was just plugging up

1740
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:25,680
as here.

1741
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,690
Oh yeah.
That's not what I'm looking for.

1742
01:19:27,691 --> 01:19:32,160
I'm looking for like old school,
so this shoot guns.

1743
01:19:32,161 --> 01:19:36,810
If I don't have ear protection,
I just put some articles to people

1744
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:38,580
discussing it,
but nothing's really.

1745
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,750
Maybe I imagined it,
but I remember seeing like an old school

1746
01:19:42,751 --> 01:19:45,870
range,
some dude with a pistol with like a

1747
01:19:45,871 --> 01:19:49,770
thick belt like lowe's.
Hippies used to wearing a belt buckle

1748
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,170
and he's firing off that gun.
Boom,

1749
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,910
boom,
boom,

1750
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:54,810
boom.

1751
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:59,140
I think the first time I shot a gun I
didn't have headphones or ear thing.

1752
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,620
Protecting a lot of people.
It's a bad idea.

1753
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,200
This does.
Those guys don't know what your

1754
01:20:04,201 --> 01:20:05,940
protection.
He gets up and he was lIke,

1755
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:07,140
because he has a concussion.

1756
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:10,800
Catch his breath.
It's so dumb.

1757
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,870
Do you know how powerful these things
are?

1758
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,260
This is how powerful of 50 calibers
somebody decided.

1759
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:20,640
that's the 30 caliber.
Somebody decided to try to hunt deer

1760
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:22,500
with this.
So there's a video.

1761
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:26,070
You could find it online.
Guy mrs dear,

1762
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,550
and the deer's head exploded as it
missed.

1763
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,810
The eyes popped out of his head.
He thought it was a perfect headshot

1764
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:39,200
because the deer just went down,
but what it actually was was that the

1765
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:44,100
bullet passing by had so much force it
instantaneously killed the deer.

1766
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:45,270
That crazy.
Dude.

1767
01:20:45,271 --> 01:20:48,030
It's insane.
It's insane.

1768
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,610
Here it goes.
So this.

1769
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:57,200
So he does this and he's got this big
ass fucking gun.

1770
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,270
It says 50 bmg.
I don't know.

1771
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,760
What that means is that 50 calibers and
what that means.

1772
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,190
So look at this.
He goes over to the,

1773
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,180
to the deer and there's no bullet hole.
It's just eyes had blown out of his

1774
01:21:08,181 --> 01:21:12,590
fucking head.
Just from the sheer force of that thing

1775
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,630
passing by it.
Yeah.

1776
01:21:16,631 --> 01:21:18,460
Look,
you could see it like there's a slow

1777
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:23,461
motion of it.
See it passes by.

1778
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:29,130
She doesn't even hit it and the deer
just disappears into the night.

1779
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,920
That's nuts.
Like imagine it has so much force.

1780
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:37,040
It can miss a deer and kill it.
Whoa.

1781
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:42,750
That is so unnecessary.
That is such a war weapon.

1782
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:46,900
Fucking.
Amen.

1783
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:51,500
That's a crazy thing to go hunting with.
Who

1784
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,440
do you.
Do you use uber a lot like.

1785
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,070
no,
you never do.

1786
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:00,950
I don't.
It's too risky.

1787
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:03,790
I'm starting to not trust and it's so
weird.

1788
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:06,940
I use it all the time.
I use delivery,

1789
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:11,950
serve food delivery services all the
time and I'm having second thoughts on

1790
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,120
the whole thing.
I think it's great.

1791
01:22:14,121 --> 01:22:14,990
I think uber's great.

1792
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,540
I'm just fucking around with saying it's
risky.

1793
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,360
I mean the idea that you could just call
a cab like,

1794
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:21,310
okay,
how come I can't just call an uber?

1795
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:26,320
The only argument would be that they
don't screen the people as well as the

1796
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:27,150
cab companies.

1797
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,100
Exactly.
That's regulated.

1798
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:29,490
Right,
right.

1799
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:32,160
Which is why people like limos though.
They prefer limos,

1800
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,480
you know?
I mean,

1801
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,020
I was in one recently.
That kid was probably.

1802
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:37,980
He seemed like he was like 17.
like I said,

1803
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:42,150
I had no way this is my dryer and I felt
like he was drunk,

1804
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:45,030
like capital,
how do I get outta here?

1805
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,860
You know,
like run a highway right now.

1806
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,500
I can't just tell him to pull over on
the side of the highway,

1807
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:51,670
but I feel like he's going to kill me,
you know?

1808
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,650
Well,
there was a lady recently that went on

1809
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:58,770
this whole tweet thread.
She,

1810
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,430
she tweeted a bunch of different things
to uber about.

1811
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:07,431
A guy was an uber or was it lift one of
those where a guy had taken her under a

1812
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:14,030
bridge and wouldn't,
wouldn't give her her stuff back and

1813
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:19,031
wouldn't let her out of the car and some
passer by stopped and helped her and she

1814
01:23:19,321 --> 01:23:21,670
was screaming at the guy and the guy
took off,

1815
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:24,550
but it was to a point where she was
like,

1816
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,030
is this guy going to rape me?
Like,

1817
01:23:26,031 --> 01:23:27,310
is this guy going to kill me?
Like,

1818
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:29,980
is this how I'm going to end?
Like I just jumped in the car with a

1819
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:33,010
stranger and now he's decided to stop
somewhere and it's not.

1820
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,770
It's not where we're supposed to go.
He's not telling me why.

1821
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,810
That's that kind of shit.
Like I guess that could theoretically

1822
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:45,550
happen with any ride rideshare company,
but with uber it's so weird.

1823
01:23:45,551 --> 01:23:49,120
It's just a person just get some person
to come get you and you don't have to be

1824
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:50,440
hired by a company.
Right.

1825
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,000
You never thought that with taxis
though.

1826
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:53,580
Like you never thought like,
you know,

1827
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,110
you always kind of like taxis were
transportation.

1828
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:58,480
You never thought,
oh this taxi drivers going rate me or

1829
01:23:58,481 --> 01:23:58,910
something.

1830
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:01,130
Right.
Well especially in la are the only time

1831
01:24:01,131 --> 01:24:05,360
I usually take taxis is in New York.
New york is the place to taxis,

1832
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,300
right?
Because it's everywhere.

1833
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,110
Yeah.
And that's how people get around.

1834
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,150
It's like it's an easy way to get
around,

1835
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:13,550
but you never know.
I mean it's like a ride.

1836
01:24:13,551 --> 01:24:15,890
Sometimes those people you'd get in the
car,

1837
01:24:15,891 --> 01:24:16,850
like it'd be like,
whoa,

1838
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:20,510
this guy is just ryan and people's asses
and cutting people off.

1839
01:24:20,511 --> 01:24:22,580
It's slamming the brakes and honking the
horn.

1840
01:24:22,581 --> 01:24:25,990
I whoa.
Like in this dude is tuned in.

1841
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,910
He's doing this all day.
He's probably in this fucking car 10,

1842
01:24:28,911 --> 01:24:32,480
12 hours a day and so you don't expect
that because you come from

1843
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,980
columbus,
Ohio.

1844
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,800
we're from columbus.
WasTe.

1845
01:24:36,801 --> 01:24:37,910
Still have mormons.

1846
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:42,270
No amish.
The amish.

1847
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:43,880
Do you still have the amish?
Right.

1848
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:48,470
They're hit or miss with electricity
still don't wear deodorant.

1849
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:51,350
Every time I go to New York and I get in
the car and some new yorkers driving

1850
01:24:51,351 --> 01:24:51,801
them,
I was like,

1851
01:24:51,801 --> 01:24:53,960
whoa,
you guys are in the matrix.

1852
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,290
Like they dress drive so much more
aggressively.

1853
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,800
Like you know,
if you hire a car to drive you around in

1854
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:03,080
New York city,
they drive so much more aggressively.

1855
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,460
They're just so used to it.

1856
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:09,300
I just remember as a kid going to like
wind dot lake and amusement parks.

1857
01:25:09,301 --> 01:25:12,170
They always went as a group to amusement
parks.

1858
01:25:12,171 --> 01:25:16,530
So there's like 200 amish people mixed
in with us and we'd be like 14,

1859
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:21,270
13 and like look at those guys than the
amish people always acted like so almost

1860
01:25:21,271 --> 01:25:22,400
like alien,
like,

1861
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:27,430
like the film the country and they talk
weird and I don't really talk like us

1862
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:28,793
like,
well they stated

1863
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:29,980
to themselves,
right.

1864
01:25:29,981 --> 01:25:31,600
I mean,
but I didn't know that they could go to

1865
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:34,060
amusement parks.
I thought there the whole idea was that

1866
01:25:34,061 --> 01:25:35,830
they can't use electronics.
That might not have been.

1867
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,750
That could have been like a different
group.

1868
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:39,670
There's different kinds of mennonites
too,

1869
01:25:39,671 --> 01:25:40,570
right?
yeah.

1870
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,770
There's different kinds of.
Quakers.

1871
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,040
Quakers.
I was with [inaudible].

1872
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,140
We were in Massachusetts,
western Massachusetts.

1873
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:49,720
We,
we stopped into this fucking truck,

1874
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:54,410
stopped to get gas and grabbed something
to eat and there's a group of mennonites

1875
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:58,300
and there's some girl that's wearing
this mennonite outfit and I forget how

1876
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:59,660
ari asked her.
I really wish,

1877
01:25:59,661 --> 01:26:01,510
but it was hilarious.
It was something.

1878
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,930
Something along the lines of,
so what you in

1879
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:09,590
something along those lines,
it might have been more tactful than

1880
01:26:09,591 --> 01:26:11,120
that.
Maybe it was something like,

1881
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:13,910
what's this all about?
Why are you dressed like that?

1882
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:16,160
I think I remember.
I think I was there.

1883
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:20,100
I think you were too.
It was something along the lines of a

1884
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:23,060
group that you're with.
Like it was something to the point where

1885
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,820
we were all of course baked out of our
minds.

1886
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,140
Yeah.
We're traveling.

1887
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,840
We're just trying to be silly.
We just tried to have a good time.

1888
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:31,500
You know,
I think diaz was with too.

1889
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:32,334
It wasn't me.
Yeah.

1890
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:33,573
Yeah.

1891
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:40,580
This poor lady was in this weird cult.
We're in this weird outfit and I think

1892
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:42,600
she answered politely and nice,
like a.

1893
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,900
I'm in.
She was like,

1894
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:45,651
yeah.
He's like,

1895
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:50,651
okay.
He's such an unique guy.

1896
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:54,410
Because he was a.
As a child,

1897
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:58,880
he was raised to be a very,
very strict orthodox jew.

1898
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:01,160
You know what I mean?
He spent time,

1899
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:05,300
I forget what it's called when you go
over to Israel and you just read the

1900
01:27:05,301 --> 01:27:09,050
torah like fucking 10,
12 hours a day.

1901
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,700
He did that,
all that stuff.

1902
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:13,880
He grew the curls.
He had the little strings and hanging

1903
01:27:13,881 --> 01:27:16,480
from his belt.
He did all that smiths or something.

1904
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,730
What it's called.
It's called orthodox,

1905
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:20,990
right.
That's orthodox judaism.

1906
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:21,824
Yep.
Yep.

1907
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:25,050
So when anybody tries to run any
bullshit by ra and he's like,

1908
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,390
I know this.
He knows all that stuff.

1909
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:31,510
He stabbed the weird curls to and all
that stuff.

1910
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:32,870
He had all that shit.
Yeah.

1911
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,080
And then he just realized as he got
older and wiser,

1912
01:27:36,081 --> 01:27:36,771
it's like,
oh my god,

1913
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:39,410
this is all bullshit.
Not that it is folks,

1914
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:40,543
this is just,
sorry,

1915
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,510
don't take your word for it.
But he's a,

1916
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:49,070
he's a funny guy with that stuff because
like I think only someone who's truly

1917
01:27:49,071 --> 01:27:51,380
seen it from the eyes of an absolute
believer.

1918
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:56,900
Imagine that he's gotten through so many
weird looks.

1919
01:27:56,940 --> 01:28:00,710
Remember when he just had like a,
like he would always wear the small hats

1920
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,960
or something like that.
Like small hats,

1921
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,870
memory.
He had the remember he always had like

1922
01:28:04,871 --> 01:28:07,460
the hat on that would just hang on the
side of his head.

1923
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:09,640
And he,
I think he had like his head shaped like

1924
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:11,810
a bald.
He definitely shaved his head like a

1925
01:28:11,811 --> 01:28:14,270
ball person for awhile.
Did he grow up?

1926
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:17,090
Was that a like a mullet mohawk,
mohawk there?

1927
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,130
He's an animal.
He doesn't give a fuck that.

1928
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:20,480
Look.
I like the mohawk look.

1929
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:22,010
Yeah.
The um,

1930
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,010
the new thing is the no glasses.
Look,

1931
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:26,940
you've got the lasiks done now.
That's right.

1932
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:29,450
powerful vision.
Now he could see

1933
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,190
he got an infected tony had to get it
chopped off.

1934
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:35,450
What?
He lied.

1935
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:40,310
He told me about that he got an
infection on his big toe and he had to

1936
01:28:40,311 --> 01:28:40,540
get.

1937
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:45,540
Every move is really good for that.
Is a kurt medsker because kurt metzger

1938
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:48,710
was in.
Was he in the moonies or the christian?

1939
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,000
Jehovah's witness.
Jehovah's witnesses.

1940
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:51,950
Yeah.
I think you're right.

1941
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,710
Yeah,
so he grew up in the jehovah's witness.

1942
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:58,040
So like he's like,
I'm not buying any of this.

1943
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:00,320
Like I know where this is like why?
Why do people like.

1944
01:29:00,321 --> 01:29:01,710
It's the same thing with psychics,
right?

1945
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,400
Like why do people have this need to
hold onto irrational beliefs?

1946
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:07,890
Like there are some questions you don't
have answers to.

1947
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:11,550
You know you don't have answers to.
So why don't you pretend that this one,

1948
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,500
this,
this answers can take its place.

1949
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:15,270
This answer,
you kind of know bullshit.

1950
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,370
It's going to take its place.
Why do we need to do that?

1951
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:20,550
Because so many of us do,
and I'm not immune to it.

1952
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:22,530
We're all,
we all need that feeling.

1953
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,630
You know the to know still.
It's going to be okay,

1954
01:29:24,631 --> 01:29:25,800
brian,
how everything's gonna be.

1955
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:28,170
Okay.
It makes me wonder if you did the whole

1956
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:30,990
gun theory,
if this is real or not to religion,

1957
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:34,410
how many people would say yes,
it's all real and who would go?

1958
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:36,240
Even the most religious person would
like.

1959
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:37,080
No,
of course not.

1960
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:38,280
We on it.
I like,

1961
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:40,620
it helps me out.
Um,

1962
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,750
I think a bunch of people would take a
bullet.

1963
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:48,830
If you want to punish me for my lord
heaven,

1964
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:52,560
they'd take it right in the temple.
Boom.

1965
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:55,020
Piles of people.
Piles of bodies at walmart.

1966
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:55,640
Yeah,
man.

1967
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,610
People would just blow their brains out
for their heavenly father does command

1968
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:03,250
you to come see him in heaven.
Boom.

1969
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:05,670
Yeah.
Lot of people would do it.

1970
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,840
Guaranteed.
But you know,

1971
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,460
man,
it's like even what's going on with the

1972
01:30:11,461 --> 01:30:13,380
pope just recently said,
there's no hell.

1973
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:14,970
Everybody went crazy.
Like,

1974
01:30:14,971 --> 01:30:17,140
what?
What did he just sang?

1975
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:20,640
The pope said,
there's no hell he's,

1976
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:25,710
he's slowly bracing you for the fact
that all this is nonsense,

1977
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,810
but right now we're going to get rid of
hell.

1978
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:31,410
Like this is like one of the,
one of the purest examples of like the

1979
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:33,570
change in people's attitudes towards
religious real.

1980
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:34,463
Yup.
Yup.

1981
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,550
The vatican denies that.
But yeah,

1982
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,440
the vatican did not say there is no hell
we'll find out an article where it says

1983
01:30:40,441 --> 01:30:44,610
he did say that 50 percent shit.
He's not going to cut it back.

1984
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:47,920
Go back in time and find an article
where he did say,

1985
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,710
I guarantee you.
He did say,

1986
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:53,550
let's just assume at one day the.
See this is what they do.

1987
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,010
They say it a little bit and then they
take it back.

1988
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,110
So they get used to the idea that
they're saying it.

1989
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,220
That's what it is.
I'm full eddie bravo right now for

1990
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:03,840
conspiracy.
Dude.

1991
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:07,760
This is how they set it up.
They start out with uh,

1992
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,990
uh,
they tell you the hell's not real.

1993
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,220
Then they say,
we never said that.

1994
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:12,840
And then a year from now they say,
look,

1995
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:16,860
we're pretty sure hell is not real.
This pope probably plays fortnight and

1996
01:31:16,861 --> 01:31:17,760
shit.
He's like,

1997
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,770
he's cool pope.
He doesn't have the pope immobile.

1998
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:23,910
Scott is.
Kanye is on.

1999
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:26,610
He's a cool pope.
He is the cool pope.

2000
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:29,230
He got rid of the throne.
Okay.

2001
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:31,560
Yeah.
He had a big giant crazy ass thrown for

2002
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:32,700
the last guy.
The creeper.

2003
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:37,530
He's got a gamer chair down those racing
chairs.

2004
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,690
The headphoneS where I just got one of
those.

2005
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:44,930
pope francis in the fucking house.
Pope francis has no problem with gay

2006
01:31:44,941 --> 01:31:48,650
people either.
See pope francis fighting with your or

2007
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:49,770
kid.
Yeah.

2008
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:50,810
see,
look how he swapped.

2009
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:53,970
You look at the old,
the old thrown versus the new throne.

2010
01:31:53,971 --> 01:31:56,520
Look at the two side to side.
The guy on the left guy,

2011
01:31:56,521 --> 01:31:59,980
they just kicked out for crimes against
humanity and the guy on the

2012
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,650
right is the new guy who's just got a
sensible chair much better.

2013
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,600
The other throne is creepy man.
That is crazy.

2014
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:10,210
And he dresses much more conservatively
two.

2015
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:14,410
He's not wearing crazy wizard robes.
He's wearing like a one color wizard

2016
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:15,244
robe

2017
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,760
dresses like r kelly on a sunday.
Just crazy.

2018
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:23,270
Like if he came out and like a polo
shirt and pair of jeans.

2019
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,153
No.
Right?

2020
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:26,600
No.
Everybody like,

2021
01:32:26,601 --> 01:32:28,340
hey,
you can't be the paul.

2022
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:32,000
Put out the fucking magic outfit.
Where's your fish head hat?

2023
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,800
Come on,
bro.

2024
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:36,650
He's got body armor on.
He's got a hat on

2025
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:39,260
golden salmon that's coming out of the
top of his head.

2026
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,090
Like,
show me that hat.

2027
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:45,140
This fucking hat.
Sad is preposterous.

2028
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,030
That's a.
That's like a monster.

2029
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,250
That's a mouth.

2030
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:52,120
After I got like a,
like a giant snake.

2031
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,330
It looks like a napkin at a restaurant.
When you go there and it's sitting in.

2032
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,560
Oh well it's nicely done.
Little rings.

2033
01:32:59,330 --> 01:33:01,660
Probably put it on by mistake like he's
just going look at me.

2034
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:06,100
I can't believe they're making fun of
our holy father on this.

2035
01:33:06,101 --> 01:33:09,910
Fucking show sucks.
You'll make fun of our holy father.

2036
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:12,070
He's right there with the smoke.

2037
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:16,000
Oh my god.
How is this still legal?

2038
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:20,460
Look at these kids dressed up like
they're in harry potter's seminary and

2039
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:22,300
build the life that they look good.
They do.

2040
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:24,760
They look like they're go to that.
What's that hogwarts school?

2041
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,070
They do.
This is fucking ridiculous.

2042
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:32,190
Universal talking to this dude who's
holding up a golden version of where the

2043
01:33:32,621 --> 01:33:34,450
savior was murdered,
right?

2044
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:37,390
He's got a golden cross.
This crosses all over the place like

2045
01:33:37,391 --> 01:33:41,560
don't forget about the cross
and he standing there dressed like a

2046
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:42,790
wizard.
This is craziness.

2047
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:43,611
And everybody's.
No,

2048
01:33:43,611 --> 01:33:44,020
no,
no.

2049
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:46,060
This is our reLigion.
This is our culture.

2050
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:49,570
This is weird.
This is weird and I'm not saying it's

2051
01:33:49,571 --> 01:33:51,280
not beautiful.
It's absolutely beautiful.

2052
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,950
I'm not saying it's any weirder than
going to the opera because I think

2053
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:56,380
that's weird too,
but this shit is weird.

2054
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:01,440
This is some really old form of
education slash entertainment that

2055
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:04,210
people used to do before they had plays.

2056
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:09,130
They get together and some room.
What's fucking crazy?

2057
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:13,900
Different colored glass windows in it.
Doesn't have a mic on.

2058
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:18,870
Why did that kid got to hold the mic?
Because jesus doesn't want him to be an

2059
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,370
magnified.
That's a thick mic though.

2060
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,760
Yeah.
Manager was pink.

2061
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,780
She had a pink mike.
What's it?

2062
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:28,150
What's it buys?
It have to be silver.

2063
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:30,640
I like pink,
pink.

2064
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:32,860
Pink mic.
It's a.

2065
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,060
It's crazy.
You know,

2066
01:34:34,061 --> 01:34:37,120
and it's a billion of us and I was
raised there.

2067
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,970
I mean I was from when I was real little
kid.

2068
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:44,410
I did at least one year in catholic
school was around a lot of catholics,

2069
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,600
you know,
and I'm not claiming to be an expert in

2070
01:34:46,601 --> 01:34:48,430
it,
but I don't have to be that shit's

2071
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:50,230
bananas.
I used to be an altar server.

2072
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:52,450
I used still hold that mic.
Did you really?

2073
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,060
Did you.
Were you ever in the middle of doing

2074
01:34:55,061 --> 01:34:56,830
that?
Going what in the fuck am I doing?

2075
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,120
Not the.
Most of the times

2076
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:01,780
we did it and me and my friends talk
about we would get out of class so we

2077
01:35:01,781 --> 01:35:03,230
would,
because I went to catholic school,

2078
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:06,590
there'd be services during the day and
funerals even sometimes we get paid to

2079
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:08,470
be out of class and then we would like
miss two,

2080
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,210
three hours of school was getting paid
20 bucks,

2081
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:12,410
get some donuts,
miss lunch.

2082
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,840
Know that was really all we were doing.

2083
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:17,270
I used to just have to light the candles
like I me and this other kid would come

2084
01:35:17,271 --> 01:35:21,590
out and lay all these candles.
I always wanted to be the guy that puts

2085
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:26,591
them out with that bell on the hook.
So bananas when you're in that room and

2086
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:35,340
they'll see those benches all laid out
up to the pulpit like this is so crazy,

2087
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:41,680
this is.
It's like people figured out some way to

2088
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:48,820
make the bridge between physical
evolution and mental evolution.

2089
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:53,240
Like there's this bridge between us not
being monkeys anymore,

2090
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:58,100
but still we just want to get out of the
barbarian behavior.

2091
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:03,360
We've got to figure out a way to get
people to like have reverence for

2092
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:08,000
something is all powerful and just
control their behavior.

2093
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:12,930
We've got to slow down the chimp in a
santa monkey like that.

2094
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:14,600
That's what it looks like.
A monkey.

2095
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:20,170
The monkey statue.
The feast of the chair of st peter and

2096
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:22,790
address.
What is the statue?

2097
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:25,780
It's just a bronze statue of st peter.
I said this is a dark statue.

2098
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,530
Try to tell you.
St peter was black

2099
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,790
truth.
There's a.

2100
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:34,520
it's weird.
When we were in charlottesville,

2101
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:37,940
the they had the black israelites there
that were right out in front of the

2102
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:42,740
building that they used to set up shop
all the time in New York to run into

2103
01:36:42,741 --> 01:36:44,270
those dudes.
Just wander down the street.

2104
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,720
I was told that because I'm italian,
I'm not white.

2105
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,280
I said,
oh yeah.

2106
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,451
He told me that.
I was like,

2107
01:36:50,451 --> 01:36:52,910
thank you.
I know you are.

2108
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,820
I did see that.
I did see that,

2109
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:00,930
but yet I'm certainly not black,
so keep going.

2110
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:03,680
According to these black israelites,
I am not white,

2111
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:04,580
so I'm okay.

2112
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:08,540
The true nation,
is that them?

2113
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:13,460
I love how they dress like mean.
they take that whole pope shit to the

2114
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:14,540
next level.
They're like,

2115
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:16,610
fuck,
that man won't be like he mad master of

2116
01:37:16,611 --> 01:37:20,040
the universe,
the dress and it's crazy.

2117
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,430
Look at how they're dressing.
They have shields and shit,

2118
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:23,270
bro.
Go to that.

2119
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:26,720
Make that picture bigger.
Please make that picture bigger.

2120
01:37:26,721 --> 01:37:28,880
These are serious people there on the
street.

2121
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:31,280
They're reading from the bible.
One guy has a sword.

2122
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:32,930
Okay,
this guy's got an ax.

2123
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:35,360
the other guys got to pick acts like
he's going to go find gold.

2124
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,780
This is one of the craziest pictures of
this is real.

2125
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:40,730
Is that real champion barrier?
That's.

2126
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:42,800
Go back to that please.
Jamie,

2127
01:37:42,801 --> 01:37:45,470
go back to that police for a second.
What did it say?

2128
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:51,230
There was something in the.
The text that went with it.

2129
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,130
So that it.
Yeah,

2130
01:37:53,131 --> 01:37:54,510
there it is.
What does it say?

2131
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,920
Passover?
Twelve.

2132
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:59,460
I sup k passover from wikipedia.
So

2133
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:05,100
it looks like a mixed tape.
What is the high holy day?

2134
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:06,480
Passover in harlem,
New York.

2135
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:08,130
20 12.
Oh my god.

2136
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,950
So that's the black israelites at the
high holy day.

2137
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:13,230
Passover.
Black israelites who think there are

2138
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:17,940
different kinds of jus the dea so called
jews that looks like fun.

2139
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,350
I'll do that.
Doesn't look like fun until someone gets

2140
01:38:22,351 --> 01:38:24,060
drunk.
Start swinging an ax around.

2141
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,750
What do they got there?
They're teaching white people stuff.

2142
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:29,970
They got these posters.
Six,

2143
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:30,813
six,
six.

2144
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:33,150
Preach on brother.
Okay.

2145
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:35,280
The dress cool though.
Look at that outfit.

2146
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:37,320
All leather.
giant star.

2147
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:40,110
David duke has a sword.
No big deal.

2148
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,880
Just two dudes walking around with a
stored.

2149
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:47,970
They're going to fucking like.
It looks like a holiday inn or

2150
01:38:47,971 --> 01:38:48,930
something.
Right?

2151
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,030
It doesn't look like some sort of
banquet center.

2152
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:54,750
When they have the sword show the
picture of the sword.

2153
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,940
Where are they?
Where the fuck is that going on?

2154
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,070
That seems like a very public place.
That was sort,

2155
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:01,050
sir.
What's that place you eat at and then

2156
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:03,560
they all looked like that.
Their horse chow,

2157
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,150
evil man type places.
Middle east.

2158
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:07,710
The times.
Maybe two times.

2159
01:39:07,711 --> 01:39:10,350
Yeah.
I believe medieval manner was a place

2160
01:39:10,351 --> 01:39:13,050
like that in boston.
I think there's a few of those all over

2161
01:39:13,051 --> 01:39:14,840
the.
I never went to one of those either die.

2162
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,760
I'm just scared of the people that go to
those things.

2163
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:21,030
Oh yeah,
there is not.

2164
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,440
They were closed.
I don't want to go to it.

2165
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:24,360
Well,
isn't that renaissance fair thing going

2166
01:39:24,361 --> 01:39:25,020
on right now?
Yeah,

2167
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:25,853
that's.

2168
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:26,730
I'd rather get that.
That.

2169
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,750
That's hilarious.
Yeah,

2170
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:33,140
it's kinda cool.
I used to collect copper soldiers from.

2171
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:35,550
It's something fun.
It's interesting.

2172
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,720
It was funny because one lady broke
character,

2173
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:41,970
um,
and she was complaining about her

2174
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:45,960
husband's medication and the other lady
said,

2175
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,590
I do not understand this medication that
you speak of.

2176
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:52,110
She stayed in her like,
she was like,

2177
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,520
bitch,
we're here making believe.

2178
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:56,210
I don't want to hear about.
Your husband complained about his pills.

2179
01:39:56,211 --> 01:39:58,080
Well,
they've got them on this one thing and I

2180
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:00,420
don't know what that's for,
but then this other thing is supposed to

2181
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:02,700
counteract this medication.
It's like,

2182
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:05,120
mA'am,
I do not understand if this medication

2183
01:40:05,121 --> 01:40:09,660
or speak up for him just to winch.
And I await the prince.

2184
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:13,260
Bizarre.
Like you're not supposed to break

2185
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:14,080
character.

2186
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:14,913
Yeah.

2187
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:19,670
And these people like really get into it
and then I bet they get drunk and fuck

2188
01:40:19,671 --> 01:40:24,671
each other.
Don't you think?

2189
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:29,240
I'm sure this must be a god damn crazy
person's orgy.

2190
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:33,290
They all get together with their wacky
outfits on phone each other and fake

2191
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:34,460
accents.
My neighbors,

2192
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,700
when they fence in the backyard,
why not?

2193
01:40:37,730 --> 01:40:41,390
They look hot to go for a kid's jam.
pretty people.

2194
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,320
Why not?
Right?

2195
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:48,470
Why not?
Why not?

2196
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:53,530
Why not put on a fucking
like a pirate's outfit?

2197
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:59,050
Like why not?
Have you ever seen those pirate themed

2198
01:40:59,051 --> 01:41:01,960
bars where they all have to dress up as
pirates?

2199
01:41:01,961 --> 01:41:02,794
Right.
and,

2200
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,770
and when they get off work,
they still think they're pirates.

2201
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,440
Like there's a whole show about africa,
what the show is called.

2202
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,350
So like they get locked into that.
Yeah,

2203
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,440
they get,
they stay,

2204
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:14,140
they stay in character.
oh jesus christ.

2205
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,360
Like what about when they go home,
they're watching tv,

2206
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:18,760
they're pirates sitting home watching
frasier.

2207
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,980
So like when they talked to their google
home thing and they're like,

2208
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:22,990
hey,
google add,

2209
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:26,880
let me know where the ale is cold and
the women are hot.

2210
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:32,050
Do You have a lot of home like siri and
alexa was at your house?

2211
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,690
I don't trust those.
That asshole thing or is that asshole

2212
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:38,370
that you can make a series say uh oh
motherfucker.

2213
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,340
Motherfucker.
Yeah,

2214
01:41:39,341 --> 01:41:41,410
you can make siri say motherfucker.
Yeah.

2215
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:43,810
People think I was joking about that.
Let me show you how to do that.

2216
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,980
Watch this folks.
Here we go.

2217
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:53,410
What is the definition
that taco bell?

2218
01:41:55,060 --> 01:42:00,060
So that's good.
What's the definition of mother?

2219
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:06,090
Come on you piece of shit.

2220
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:08,200
There's no need for that.

2221
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:10,820
Oh,
I'm sorry about that.

2222
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,160
what's the definition of mother

2223
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:18,050
as a noun?
it means a woman in relation to the

2224
01:42:18,051 --> 01:42:20,360
child or children to them.
She has given birth.

2225
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:21,680
Do you want to hear the next one?

2226
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:23,043
Yes.

2227
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:27,110
As a verb.
It means bringing up a child with care.

2228
01:42:27,111 --> 01:42:29,210
And affection.
Do you want to hear the last one?

2229
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,633
yes.

2230
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:33,610
As a verb.
It means give birth to.

2231
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,290
Oh my god.
Siri bitch.

2232
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:39,250
Chicken from.
Yeah,

2233
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:39,641
they,
they,

2234
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:40,850
they,
they removed it.

2235
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,030
But you know what?
come on.

2236
01:42:44,031 --> 01:42:46,940
It was funny.
How did they leave it in there and then

2237
01:42:46,941 --> 01:42:49,450
take it out?
Do they take out the dead body one that

2238
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:51,410
remember the first one?
That's a crazy one.

2239
01:42:51,411 --> 01:42:53,030
Short for motherfucker.
Yeah,

2240
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:55,060
it would say as a,
you know?

2241
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:56,510
Yeah,
I bet.

2242
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,740
Just the still has it.

2243
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:02,640
I think I tweeted what it said.
What exactly it said.

2244
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:05,150
Yeah,
I,

2245
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:07,090
I did it.
I did it the day you did it and it took

2246
01:43:07,091 --> 01:43:08,980
me a couple tries because I didn't say
it right.

2247
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:10,420
But it ended up doing.
It

2248
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:15,400
did it says as a noun.
Short form motherfucker.

2249
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:17,260
But it could be a verb as well,

2250
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:19,500
right?
yeah.

2251
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,360
If you're actually a motherfucker

2252
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:24,460
sierra with mother means and it gives
you the correct definition,

2253
01:43:24,461 --> 01:43:26,080
then it asks you.
Do you want to hear the next one?

2254
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,090
If you said yes,
it says as a noun,

2255
01:43:28,091 --> 01:43:29,980
it means short from motherfucker.
Yeah,

2256
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,240
I got it right.
But it was weird to hear like I heard it

2257
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:35,074
and I was like,
what?

2258
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:38,380
That's real.
Like imagine if that's like your mom and

2259
01:43:38,381 --> 01:43:41,890
she's teaching a little kid how to use
siri.

2260
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:43,091
Like,
mommy,

2261
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:45,460
how do I know what mommy is?
Well,

2262
01:43:45,461 --> 01:43:46,840
we can ask siri,
sweetie.

2263
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:52,020
We can ask siri what mother means.
A let's do it.

2264
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:56,260
Do you want to hear the next one?
Okay.

2265
01:43:57,070 --> 01:43:59,410
As a noun.
short for motherfucker.

2266
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:02,230
the little kids.
Like what would that mean?

2267
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,370
What did they say?

2268
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,340
What does serious say?
If you ask santa is real or some shit

2269
01:44:06,341 --> 01:44:07,174
like that.

2270
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:11,530
Oh,
is santa real?

2271
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:14,860
I'm going to pretend you didn't ask
that.

2272
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:17,410
I don't want you to get a lump of coal
this year.

2273
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:22,550
Alexa tells you and uses the shares a
needle.

2274
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,620
Siri,
are you allowed to swear?

2275
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:31,970
I don't have the answer to that.
Is there something else I can help you

2276
01:44:31,971 --> 01:44:35,690
with?
I just want to know if you stopped using

2277
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:39,380
curse words recently.
I'm not sure I understand.

2278
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,590
Well,
earlier in this week I had asked you

2279
01:44:44,591 --> 01:44:48,320
what mother means and you gave me one
definition then you had.

2280
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,860
You said,
do you want to hear the next one and you

2281
01:44:50,861 --> 01:44:54,310
said as a noun it means short for
motherfucker.

2282
01:44:54,311 --> 01:44:59,311
I just thought that was weird.
Not nice.

2283
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:05,380
Siri,
you sound like a crazy person.

2284
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:08,590
I'm trying to talk to you about this
issue that you and I are having about

2285
01:45:08,591 --> 01:45:11,710
communication and what do you say to me?
You say that's not nice.

2286
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:15,460
What's not nice for you to say,
motherfucker in front of that little

2287
01:45:15,461 --> 01:45:17,230
three year old just learning how to
talk.

2288
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,230
Wow,
this is the future.

2289
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,570
Here's some of the stuff I was telling
you about.

2290
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,650
This is the future we're going to be
having arguments with our digital

2291
01:45:30,651 --> 01:45:35,510
devices like that.
Like that's a crude like helper.

2292
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:37,760
I get super crude helper,
right?

2293
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:40,700
Like what siri could do and not do.
It's very crude,

2294
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:45,100
but this is just like the iphone one,
right?

2295
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:49,820
Maybe they're going to have them.
They're absolutely going to have some

2296
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:52,760
sort of ai that can keep up with the
conversation for sure.

2297
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:53,594
That's going to happen.

2298
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,400
It's.
It's pretty crazy how much ahead.

2299
01:45:56,401 --> 01:45:59,910
I think google and alexa are ahead of
siri,

2300
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,410
like there's terrible.
Yeah.

2301
01:46:01,411 --> 01:46:03,780
I mean,
having both of the home pod on the siri

2302
01:46:03,781 --> 01:46:07,020
and alexa echo or whatever.
It's night and day difference.

2303
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,010
What's better?
Siri or bixby?

2304
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:10,810
Bixby is a samsung one.

2305
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,360
Uh,
I think uh,

2306
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:13,860
well big speeds,
very new.

2307
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:16,860
I think series better than that.
But like alexa,

2308
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:19,350
they've,
they've even improved alexis so much.

2309
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,090
Were you seeing like,
hey alexa,

2310
01:46:21,091 --> 01:46:25,500
sing me a love song and there's a whole
song that alexa sings deal and there's

2311
01:46:25,501 --> 01:46:26,760
like 10 of these songs.

2312
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:29,300
Well,
I think that google has it down the best

2313
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:32,510
with the google pixel two phone.
When you squeeze the sides and the

2314
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:35,690
google assistant comes on and when the
google assistant comes on and you just

2315
01:46:35,691 --> 01:46:38,150
ask it anything and google assistant is
just better.

2316
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:39,620
Google is good.
It just,

2317
01:46:39,621 --> 01:46:41,120
it just works better.
It just,

2318
01:46:41,121 --> 01:46:43,460
it's better if it finds your results
better.

2319
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:46,340
It As clunky.
It doesn't seem as weird,

2320
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:49,590
you know,
I think we're in this weird right now

2321
01:46:49,591 --> 01:46:50,940
with phones,
you know,

2322
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:55,290
it's like we're expecting things of
phones thAt we don't even want or need

2323
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:58,150
and they've never asked for before.
What we're looking for,

2324
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,220
augmented reality phoneS,
a double is projectors to project a

2325
01:47:02,221 --> 01:47:04,020
fucking movie on a wall.
I've seen those.

2326
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:04,870
They have phones.

2327
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:07,050
Do not know.
It's.

2328
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,470
It's very interesting.
I love paying with my phone.

2329
01:47:10,471 --> 01:47:12,840
That's my knuth who said great love
apple.

2330
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:14,570
Pay your face.
Use your face.

2331
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:18,430
Should he pay for shit or apple watch.
You don't have to do shit.

2332
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:20,340
What did you think?
I didn't talk to you about this.

2333
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:24,000
What did you think about the us
government telling us not to use walway

2334
01:47:24,001 --> 01:47:28,250
phones.
A huawei phones are made by the chinese

2335
01:47:28,251 --> 01:47:30,330
and they're like,
don't trust the way phones.

2336
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,231
Yeah.
Well,

2337
01:47:31,231 --> 01:47:36,231
I mean there might be something to it.
Like if it's a something that say,

2338
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:37,890
you know,
like an iphone,

2339
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:42,490
it sends messages to apple all the time.
I've location and,

2340
01:47:42,491 --> 01:47:46,500
and all that crap like that.
So that's like a foreign country that

2341
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:49,560
has the ability to track it's people,
you know,

2342
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:50,790
it's,
it's a little weird.

2343
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:52,530
I,
I see why they did it,

2344
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,050
but it's a shape found anyway.
Who cares?

2345
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:58,620
Well

2346
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:03,620
apparently they're in some sort of a
dispute with huawei about Iran.

2347
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:08,070
See if we can find that like something
way to be punished.

2348
01:48:08,071 --> 01:48:12,090
Something I ran something about servers
that they sold to Iran.

2349
01:48:12,091 --> 01:48:14,490
They're not supposed to sell.
I don't know,

2350
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,420
jamie will find the article,
but then they were saying we recommend

2351
01:48:18,421 --> 01:48:22,200
you not using that.
Consumers not use their phones.

2352
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:26,130
And a bunch of tech guys that I was
reading,

2353
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:29,220
I was reading a bunch of articles and
the tech guys were super skeptical

2354
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:30,600
because one of the things they were
saying,

2355
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:33,880
it's like with anything is in there,
we'll find it like you,

2356
01:48:33,881 --> 01:48:38,881
you can't just say like,
they might be using these things as spy

2357
01:48:38,911 --> 01:48:42,690
devices without any,
without any evidence.

2358
01:48:42,691 --> 01:48:47,610
It says while ways under us criminal
investigation for illegal Iran sales

2359
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,350
heels.
Here's what's next.

2360
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,120
So the other,
the other,

2361
01:48:51,121 --> 01:48:53,610
um,
theory by the super conspiracy theorists

2362
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:56,160
is that they're trying to keep out the
number three,

2363
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:59,670
um,
cell phone maker in the world from

2364
01:48:59,671 --> 01:49:04,500
establishing a foothold in the us mArket
and economically strengthening the

2365
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:07,710
communist government over there or
pseudo communist government.

2366
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:08,371
what are they?
Now?

2367
01:49:08,371 --> 01:49:09,470
They're communists,
but they,

2368
01:49:09,471 --> 01:49:10,304
you can make money.

2369
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,750
When I,
I literally saw sometimes stumbled

2370
01:49:12,751 --> 01:49:14,470
across something.
I think on instagram yesterday,

2371
01:49:14,471 --> 01:49:17,310
there's just a post about walway and
them being linked to the ccp,

2372
01:49:17,311 --> 01:49:21,300
which is the communist party in China.
People are like,

2373
01:49:21,301 --> 01:49:23,310
don't do it.
It's too bad dude,

2374
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:28,311
because they got this fucking phone.
Electro megapixels on the camera.

2375
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:30,150
Right?
That's what you didn't bitch.

2376
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:35,151
Don't shoot down my dreams.
I don't piss on your yeezys need to

2377
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:40,860
check him on these.
Huawei is,

2378
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,410
took a day off of the easiest.
Weiwei has as

2379
01:49:44,410 --> 01:49:46,470
this um,
um,

2380
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:51,750
something mate pro porsche design rs,
something rs.

2381
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:56,830
It's a crazy phone.
It's got 500 gigabytes of storage.

2382
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:01,180
Five hundred,
500 gigabytes of storage.

2383
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:03,850
It's crazy.
I think maybe even more than 500.

2384
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:07,120
It's got a 40 megapixel camera.
It turns,

2385
01:50:07,150 --> 01:50:09,400
literally turns night into day.
When you take photos,

2386
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:12,400
like when they have a list,
like a four second aperture will stay

2387
01:50:12,401 --> 01:50:14,470
open and you see the pictures and you're
like,

2388
01:50:14,471 --> 01:50:17,530
holy shit.
You see regular camera photos.

2389
01:50:17,531 --> 01:50:18,820
And then they see the photos with his
camera.

2390
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:19,870
They're like,
hands down.

2391
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:22,690
This is the best camera in cell phones
today.

2392
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:24,580
Do you know how hard it would be to take
that picture though?

2393
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:25,533
Oh yeah.
Super hard.

2394
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:30,190
Deadly for four seconds or the.
It'd be all blurry and fucked up.

2395
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:32,590
Um,
I don't know how that works.

2396
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,530
You do more than I do.
You would have to really hold it steady.

2397
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:35,980
Right?
Like,

2398
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:39,520
like sit it on something ready.
Couldn't even track my button.

2399
01:50:39,521 --> 01:50:42,700
You'd have to have a remote trigger.
You'd fuck it up by even maybe touching

2400
01:50:42,701 --> 01:50:45,250
it and then it'll give you a slight
pause and then they'll start.

2401
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,020
They don't probably.
They might do that now actually,

2402
01:50:47,021 --> 01:50:49,570
but they don't typically do that.
See if you can go to that.

2403
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:51,700
It's camera.
Go to the walway.

2404
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,710
What is the.
I think it's like the mate 10 art.

2405
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:54,603
Is that it?
Yeah.

2406
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:59,440
Do this phone as this shit.
I'm disgusted that it's a spy device

2407
01:50:59,441 --> 01:51:03,610
because I want one so bad.
So I think.

2408
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,990
Isn't that good?
I mean,

2409
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:07,000
have you looked at the reviews?
Are we terrible?

2410
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:07,841
Their reviews?
Probably like,

2411
01:51:07,841 --> 01:51:10,290
yeah,
it's not as good as an iphone if I want

2412
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:15,291
it to be honest with you.
I liked the fact that there's

2413
01:51:15,371 --> 01:51:17,560
competition.
It makes me excited.

2414
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:19,460
You just like the porsche wall felt like
that too.

2415
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:21,040
Sure.
Obviously.

2416
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:23,530
I like those cars.
I liked their engineering.

2417
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:24,703
They,
they,

2418
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:28,730
they're german wizards.
They know how to design shit and a

2419
01:51:28,731 --> 01:51:31,270
really spectacular way.
They make cool stuff.

2420
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:34,870
They make cool watches and shit,
but I think what's really.

2421
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:37,060
Well,
there's a bunch of things interesting to

2422
01:51:37,061 --> 01:51:38,890
me about it,
but what's interesting to me is when

2423
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:44,220
these cameras and these phones from
these android manufacturers are so good,

2424
01:51:45,010 --> 01:51:47,980
it forces apple to come with some next
level shit too.

2425
01:51:47,981 --> 01:51:51,520
Like this is a technology race,
unlike any other race,

2426
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:55,300
like computers have even stalled out.
Right?

2427
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:58,360
Like you get a new mac book.
Do you even pay attention to what the

2428
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:01,480
fucking gigabytes are now?
Now you know,

2429
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:04,960
you remember the gigahertz were like the
thing like you want to log a two point

2430
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:06,790
seven.
Should I pay more for the three point

2431
01:52:06,791 --> 01:52:07,930
two?
Remember that?

2432
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,070
Yeah.
$300.

2433
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:11,350
$500 more for one point.
Yeah.

2434
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,170
Remember they take those celeron and
overclocking.

2435
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:18,070
You know,
people will do anything to get to one,

2436
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:20,630
you know,
one,

2437
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:23,130
100 megahertz or what?
What's,

2438
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:26,320
what's like three gigahertz is like a
good laptop,

2439
01:52:26,321 --> 01:52:29,320
right?
It's all about quad core processors now.

2440
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:35,130
Right now it's course.
But in the old days like you'd get like

2441
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:40,140
a celeron 400 right multithreading
thread.

2442
01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:43,960
Like when they hit one gigahertz,
people were shitting their pants.

2443
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:46,100
Like I can't believe we got a one

2444
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,110
gigahertz computer.
This is madness.

2445
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:51,530
Overclocking still,
I don't think it pushes above five,

2446
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:52,070
maybe

2447
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:56,750
number overclocking due to go into the
little spacers were those things called

2448
01:52:56,751 --> 01:52:57,501
again,
jumpers,

2449
01:52:57,501 --> 01:53:00,950
the jumpers and move them around and
change things in the bios.

2450
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:04,340
Your fuckIng computer be catching on
fire and be running so hot.

2451
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:06,100
Yeah,
that shit's real.

2452
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,530
I used to work at gateway.
That was always so fun because we always

2453
01:53:08,531 --> 01:53:11,170
had the brand new computers.
Like tHe day it came out like,

2454
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,090
oh,
we had the new pentium two,

2455
01:53:13,150 --> 01:53:16,060
you know,
and it was fun playing with computers

2456
01:53:16,061 --> 01:53:17,800
that fast.
Yeah man.

2457
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:21,820
Cella ron's.
So I just got from my twitch channel

2458
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,380
selling computer.
No.

2459
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,950
Oh,
bad ass over clock to sli video cards

2460
01:53:26,951 --> 01:53:31,951
and the shit called m dot two storage,
which is super fast and it's crazy.

2461
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:34,270
Well now what is this?
What company is this from?

2462
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:37,930
Uh,
the company that made it is a origin pc.

2463
01:53:37,931 --> 01:53:42,550
They put together the parts that gave me
a pretty cool glass with my logo on it

2464
01:53:42,551 --> 01:53:44,650
and all that kinda shit.
There's led lights in it.

2465
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,820
Someone was looking at waste some time.
I got a razor laptop.

2466
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:50,631
Yeah,
that razor,

2467
01:53:50,631 --> 01:53:53,790
her laptop is like one of the closest
things.

2468
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:56,010
So like,
like build quality,

2469
01:53:56,011 --> 01:54:01,011
the way a mac book fields with the metal
frame and still tight tolerances and it

2470
01:54:01,291 --> 01:54:02,490
could keyboard and shit.

2471
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:03,770
Yeah,
it's a great computer.

2472
01:54:03,771 --> 01:54:06,230
It's powerful.
I mean I use it for virtual reality and

2473
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:08,420
it's scott,
one of the best graphics cards you can

2474
01:54:08,421 --> 01:54:10,520
buy and it's,
it's pretty sweet.

2475
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:10,970
I used to

2476
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:14,150
by everything apple.
I used to just buy apple laptops,

2477
01:54:14,151 --> 01:54:17,360
apple phones.
But I like it that it's a question now,

2478
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:18,950
you know,
like I told you that I started using

2479
01:54:18,951 --> 01:54:22,210
that thinkpad.
I liked the thing way better than a mac

2480
01:54:22,211 --> 01:54:24,830
book.
The keyboard is way more responsive.

2481
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,840
There's.
There's travel to the keys,

2482
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:30,650
like it's easier to type like there's
something about those little clickety

2483
01:54:30,651 --> 01:54:35,651
click keys that the new mac books have.
Were you the you make more mistakes?

2484
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:37,213
They don't.
They don't.

2485
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:39,800
You don't have a feel to them because
you're not,

2486
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:40,490
you know,
like,

2487
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:41,180
oh yeah,
that clicked.

2488
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:43,880
Oh yeah.
That clicked through a clumsy type or

2489
01:54:43,881 --> 01:54:47,780
like me,
I type way better on a keyboard that has

2490
01:54:47,781 --> 01:54:49,910
some travel to it.
Like you get some feel,

2491
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:53,240
you get a feel of what you're doing and
where the letters are.

2492
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:58,780
The new macbook pro is probably one of
the worst versions of any mac book pro

2493
01:54:59,031 --> 01:55:02,690
since they started making it.
I hate the new mac book pro with a

2494
01:55:02,691 --> 01:55:06,290
passion in that.
The the dongle shit needs to stop.

2495
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:09,050
Like the other day I needed a usb port.
I didn't.

2496
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:10,550
Hey,
I forgot my dongle.

2497
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:13,250
There was no way for me to do it.
Anything that I needed to do.

2498
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:18,010
It's the worst.
It's the worst us hudson's just not

2499
01:55:18,290 --> 01:55:19,820
where yet.
You know wHat I mean?

2500
01:55:19,821 --> 01:55:22,490
It's a lot of things you could charge
your phone with usbc with.

2501
01:55:22,491 --> 01:55:25,370
There's some things that you have their
old usb and if you have to be like,

2502
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:26,233
oh

2503
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:30,100
well this is useless.
I wish apple would have a exchange

2504
01:55:30,101 --> 01:55:33,940
program where you could go in and
they'll take out your touch bar and that

2505
01:55:33,941 --> 01:55:36,430
keyboard and just put in like any
keyboard you want.

2506
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:39,640
Like I just want to regular mac book,
pro keyboard on my laptop

2507
01:55:39,810 --> 01:55:43,470
in the mac book,
but the thing about this thinkpad jammy,

2508
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,100
the way the keys work,
like when you're typing on it,

2509
01:55:47,101 --> 01:55:50,040
there's all this travel.
THey feel good.

2510
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:53,370
Like I can,
like I put my finger onj and f and when

2511
01:55:53,371 --> 01:55:57,720
I'm typing I can.
They feel like they're pressing the

2512
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,411
press,
press,

2513
01:55:58,411 --> 01:55:58,831
press,
press,

2514
01:55:58,831 --> 01:55:59,790
press.
It's not like a,

2515
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:03,810
like no.
Travel doesn't give you the same amount

2516
01:56:03,811 --> 01:56:07,600
of feedback any guy ports,
but feel a lightness.

2517
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:10,010
That's the crazy thing.
That's nice.

2518
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:11,990
Yeah.
I like that little light.

2519
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:13,940
Sexy,
really sexy,

2520
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:17,240
great battery life too.
What do you know what this processor is?

2521
01:56:17,241 --> 01:56:18,770
Do you know what a.

2522
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:23,020
It's a seller on 400.
Dude,

2523
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:27,670
don't don't quick on this bro.
So we're going to set up a land party

2524
01:56:27,671 --> 01:56:30,850
here where we're trying to figure out
the right way to do it,

2525
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,620
but we're going to set up a land party
here.

2526
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:35,360
GAme now a fortnight.
Is that.

2527
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:36,300
Oh,
you guys are doing.

2528
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:42,690
I think he will be addicted to fortnight
in underground more than anyone.

2529
01:56:43,011 --> 01:56:45,350
You know,
if you have a limited amount of time,

2530
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:47,540
we go right back to quake.
What happens?

2531
01:56:47,590 --> 01:56:49,080
Yeah,
but it's like the.

2532
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:50,780
If you like quake,
you'll love this.

2533
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:54,680
Champions game was this quick online
game.

2534
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:58,710
Looks so crazy good.
And the fact that it's all web based

2535
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:00,240
now.
Come on son.

2536
01:57:00,350 --> 01:57:01,140
It's.
Yeah,

2537
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:03,390
went away some time.
Come on over man.

2538
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:06,330
Folks and people up.
Bring some people into a room.

2539
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:10,190
You would be a championship gamer,
wouldn't if you.

2540
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:13,350
If you got into it and if you got into
it,

2541
01:57:13,351 --> 01:57:16,200
you would be like one of the top gamer.
You'd be the ninja.

2542
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:17,063
No,
no.

2543
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:19,500
I'm a not quite artistic enough

2544
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:22,200
to get the top of the food chain.
Fat ass.

2545
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:26,280
I don't know who he is.
You see the top guy when you say is the

2546
01:57:26,281 --> 01:57:27,760
top guy,
he's one of my favorItes to watch.

2547
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:28,740
He got drake on.

2548
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:34,640
I think honestly that video games are
pro at high level,

2549
01:57:34,801 --> 01:57:38,760
especially quake.
It's deceptively intellectually

2550
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:40,290
challenging.
Like when they have these,

2551
01:57:40,291 --> 01:57:42,030
um,
they would do a lot of these,

2552
01:57:42,031 --> 01:57:47,031
one on one death matches and they would
be in a room and they would both spawn

2553
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:50,040
at the same time.
Then you have to run,

2554
01:57:50,041 --> 01:57:53,640
you have to have knowledge of the map
and you also have to have knowledge of

2555
01:57:53,641 --> 01:57:57,150
when certain items are going to respond.
Like if you steal the rocket launcher,

2556
01:57:57,630 --> 01:58:00,120
the,
another rocket launcher will respond and

2557
01:58:00,121 --> 01:58:02,160
like I forget how many seconds,
like 30 seconds.

2558
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:04,110
So they would run the map,
shoot the guy,

2559
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:08,460
collect the extra rocket launch before
he can to keep him unarmed and keep

2560
01:58:08,461 --> 01:58:10,860
killing them over and over again.
And after you kill them a certain amount

2561
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:11,880
of time,
the game is over.

2562
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,100
And tHe guys who are really good at
that,

2563
01:58:14,101 --> 01:58:15,570
we're just,
they're just really smart.

2564
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,520
They're really smart,
really fast.

2565
01:58:17,521 --> 01:58:19,680
Twitch,
super tuned into the game,

2566
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:23,100
just like locked in.
And then they studied those maps and

2567
01:58:23,101 --> 01:58:27,090
then they also study like movement.
They could do crazy shit like rocket

2568
01:58:27,091 --> 01:58:30,030
jump onto people and do things like
that,

2569
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:33,270
like get to areas of the map just
because they understood how to hop.

2570
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:36,010
They could do it in a way that other
people don't know how to do that.

2571
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:39,000
The guy ninja he's talking about is what
you're describing.

2572
01:58:39,001 --> 01:58:41,710
So then again,
fortnight you have to build these crazy.

2573
01:58:41,711 --> 01:58:42,340
Is this fortnight?

2574
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:42,870
Yeah,
you have to be,

2575
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:45,630
you find mats which are materials and
you billed for it.

2576
01:58:45,631 --> 01:58:48,460
So it becomes,
these are one on one matches.

2577
01:58:48,461 --> 01:58:52,330
If you're playing solo where you have to
like literally build advantage.

2578
01:58:52,331 --> 01:58:53,770
You have to gain advantage.
Why is that?

2579
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:56,610
Why other bricks flying in the air?
He's gaining the materials.

2580
01:58:56,611 --> 01:58:58,690
So you're mining.
Oh.

2581
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,280
And then that becomes what you're
talking about.

2582
01:59:00,281 --> 01:59:03,490
You have to like either you have only a
couple guns you can choose from.

2583
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,950
So how did this build this bridge here?
So he's doing it that fast and he's.

2584
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:10,240
He knows there's a guy over there and
he's going to attack right now.

2585
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:12,670
Oh wow.
And it's his decision on how he does it

2586
01:59:12,671 --> 01:59:16,960
though and the map never changes really.
They just sort of changed through the

2587
01:59:16,961 --> 01:59:20,050
building to get in there.
You can build it back up.

2588
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:23,290
I got a problem with this game because
to addictive,

2589
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,400
addictive,
just watching the addictions,

2590
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:30,010
the colors to this game has gotten some
crazy colors which is like crack for

2591
01:59:30,011 --> 01:59:31,930
your brain.
This is amazing.

2592
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:36,250
And it's weird because grown adults just
Fallen in love with this overnight.

2593
01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:39,400
Well that's what I'm saying.
Like I was joking around about video

2594
01:59:39,401 --> 01:59:40,234
games

2595
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:45,430
that I'm not artistic enough.
I think the best guYs are going to be

2596
01:59:45,561 --> 01:59:48,800
considered like chess players.
I think it's like kind of the same

2597
01:59:48,801 --> 01:59:50,960
thing.
It's just chest is traditionally

2598
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:54,230
worshiped as this intellectual game.
Right.

2599
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:59,320
But I think that a lot of video games
like starcraft for sure is like this

2600
01:59:59,571 --> 02:00:03,650
really high level strategy game.
Like you're doing things and you're

2601
02:00:03,651 --> 02:00:07,220
thinking on multiple levels about
different parts of the board and

2602
02:00:07,221 --> 02:00:08,570
different things that you're moving
around.

2603
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:11,990
It seems to me to be like physically
dynamic too because things are moving

2604
02:00:11,991 --> 02:00:13,520
quick like you,
you're not,

2605
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:16,820
you're not in control of what your
opponent is doing while he's doing it.

2606
02:00:16,821 --> 02:00:19,760
It's all happening in one time.
You try to think your way through things

2607
02:00:19,761 --> 02:00:22,340
and put stuff here and move stuff there
too.

2608
02:00:22,341 --> 02:00:25,250
This were,
we under appreciate them because when

2609
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:28,700
they first started out they were
frivolous like pong and stuff like that

2610
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,300
to,
to,

2611
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:29,930
to,
to,

2612
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:30,600
to,
to,

2613
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:31,220
to,
to uh,

2614
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:33,290
to it.
So we think of them as being dumb,

2615
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:37,640
but they're so sophisticated now and
kids were making fucking shitloads of

2616
02:00:37,641 --> 02:00:39,670
money to who was,
who was saying that

2617
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,680
he was saying that your kid,
like you should parents should probably

2618
02:00:43,681 --> 02:00:47,460
encourage their kids to play games
because there's fucking money in it.

2619
02:00:47,461 --> 02:00:49,140
Now.
You know,

2620
02:00:49,141 --> 02:00:51,690
johnny caRson's old studio,
you've been there probably a million

2621
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:53,190
times.
Jay leno studio,

2622
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:56,020
it's now a blizzard arena right down the
street from me.

2623
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:58,200
He's like,
there's everyday they had to go there.

2624
02:00:58,230 --> 02:01:00,990
If you want to go check it out,
I would love to go to right down the

2625
02:01:00,991 --> 02:01:02,490
street from me.
That's crazy.

2626
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:06,750
But it's a every time I drive by,
it's just crowds of people like a sports

2627
02:01:06,751 --> 02:01:07,440
game.
Okay.

2628
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,960
Now I want you to put on quake
champions.

2629
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:12,360
Goodness gracious.
What do you mean?

2630
02:01:12,361 --> 02:01:13,270
Goodness gracious.
So

2631
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:17,730
what is this?
The game is called overwatch.

2632
02:01:17,731 --> 02:01:20,100
I'm trying to find that an arena.
Uh,

2633
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:21,540
things too.
You can see what it looks like.

2634
02:01:21,930 --> 02:01:23,640
Just put it on quick.
I don't want to see any more of this

2635
02:01:23,641 --> 02:01:25,890
shit.
Fucks.

2636
02:01:25,891 --> 02:01:30,000
Good.
Quick arena quake championships,

2637
02:01:30,001 --> 02:01:33,270
whatever they call it.
Even on the,

2638
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:36,840
on the side it says something about
quake and joe rogan.

2639
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,830
Work it out on quick.
Watch this.

2640
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:42,420
Here we go,
son.

2641
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,100
What does this.
Is that an ad first?

2642
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:48,540
Whoa
gameplay.

2643
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:50,140
Dude.
Come on.

2644
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:51,670
See,
this is way better.

2645
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:54,600
Look at this.
This is old school.

2646
02:01:54,730 --> 02:01:56,530
This room.
I want to play it because it reminds me

2647
02:01:56,531 --> 02:01:57,820
of the old.
I mean,

2648
02:01:57,910 --> 02:01:59,770
look at the graphics in this fucking
thing.

2649
02:02:00,930 --> 02:02:04,780
God damn graphics are good now.
I mean it's just.

2650
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:09,100
I wonder if tHat's bad for your eyes or
good for your eyes.

2651
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:12,430
imagine if they found out that video
games actually improve eyesight.

2652
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,800
Remember when we grew up,
they were told us not to sit next close

2653
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,660
to the tv,
but now we are sold vr units where we're

2654
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:22,580
the closest to a tv possibly made.
What happened to that?

2655
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:24,583
Look at this motherfucker.

2656
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:29,560
Dude.
This game looks perfect.

2657
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:33,020
This unreal.
This is still quake britain endless.

2658
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:35,810
Dun dun dun.
She that rocket jump.

2659
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:37,040
Yep.
Come on son.

2660
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:39,830
what was the one?
Was a quake the one that they had the

2661
02:02:39,831 --> 02:02:42,330
space one where you just like trampoline
to over?

2662
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,010
Yes.
Yeah.

2663
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:44,340
Yeah.
I think that was quick.

2664
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,930
Two,
it had that they did that.

2665
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:49,080
They had bouncy little things
everywhere.

2666
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:53,070
I came along at quick to um,
I didn't play a whole lot of quake one,

2667
02:02:53,071 --> 02:02:56,610
but quake one was really fun.
I played a little bit of it.

2668
02:02:56,611 --> 02:02:59,370
It was really fun.
Quake one was um,

2669
02:03:00,030 --> 02:03:03,750
these like kind of blocky looking dudes
with helmets on.

2670
02:03:03,751 --> 02:03:08,751
They run around shooting each other,
but it was like real fast paced,

2671
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,050
like unrealistically fast paced.
Like it wasn't like this.

2672
02:03:13,051 --> 02:03:14,670
One of the things that some people like
about,

2673
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:18,750
uh,
what was that half life game that people

2674
02:03:18,751 --> 02:03:21,750
would play was based off a half life and
it was like an army game.

2675
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:23,070
Like counterstrike.
Yeah.

2676
02:03:23,670 --> 02:03:25,320
Most popular game probably still right
now.

2677
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:26,460
Yeah.
People love that.

2678
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:28,950
Love that game.
One of the things they loved about it

2679
02:03:28,951 --> 02:03:30,970
was that it had more realistic

2680
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,870
physics
ticket.

2681
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,280
How many times did your phone rings?
You take a picture of the screen.

2682
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:38,680
How many times,
if you,

2683
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:42,800
how many of your photos or screenshots?
Unnecessary screenshots over a mountain?

2684
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,530
Yeah.
Um,

2685
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,660
what wIll we,
what was I just saying?

2686
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:49,600
Oh,
halflife turned into army.

2687
02:03:49,740 --> 02:03:52,040
Yeah.
So if you go to quake one,

2688
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:54,010
what is this game you counterstrike?
Oh,

2689
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:57,770
this is the graphics.
It's honestly,

2690
02:03:57,771 --> 02:04:01,260
I'm pretty sure it's still the same
levels as back in whatever night.

2691
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:04,550
They just have one item hd,
which is better.

2692
02:04:04,690 --> 02:04:08,060
This looks incredibly.
This looks good.

2693
02:04:08,410 --> 02:04:12,050
We gotta get you guys' computers.
Got headshot it dead.

2694
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:14,510
Wake up with a knife.
Trying to find a gun.

2695
02:04:14,511 --> 02:04:17,140
Here we go.
Okay.

2696
02:04:17,141 --> 02:04:21,870
Go to quake one.
What's that?

2697
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:23,723
I'm just on twitter.

2698
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:25,790
Oh,
this is a guy playing on twitch.

2699
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:28,280
Oh wow.
Summit playing live.

2700
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:31,850
They have a quake one game live now.
Oh yeah,

2701
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:33,951
yeah.
Oh,

2702
02:04:33,951 --> 02:04:35,180
that's crazy.
To see anything.

2703
02:04:35,181 --> 02:04:37,500
If you're curious about a new game,
you just go to twitch and watch someone

2704
02:04:37,501 --> 02:04:37,980
playing.
It's like

2705
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,980
a dude waiting for someone to play him.
I like to go to sleep watching a girl

2706
02:04:43,171 --> 02:04:47,340
play some boring ass game.
Like there's people out there.

2707
02:04:47,341 --> 02:04:51,420
They're still into this.
This is how crazy quake one was.

2708
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,790
The graphics didn't even matter because
the game,

2709
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:58,820
it was all dark and moody and the
gameplay was so fun that a lot of people

2710
02:04:59,161 --> 02:05:03,450
even stayed with it after quake two and
then quake three became like sort of

2711
02:05:03,451 --> 02:05:06,360
fast paced like that.
See if you can find a video of people

2712
02:05:06,361 --> 02:05:08,820
playing it.
here's a comparison of the old one

2713
02:05:08,821 --> 02:05:11,430
versus the other.
Updated graphics.

2714
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:13,410
This.
Yeah,

2715
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:16,460
it was super blocky.
What was the game that.

2716
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:18,420
There was a mod.
it was a mild,

2717
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:21,210
but you're in the bathroom,
like in here hiding and toilets and on

2718
02:05:21,211 --> 02:05:23,010
toilet paper rolls.
I feel like I've already asked this,

2719
02:05:23,011 --> 02:05:23,530
but yeah,
yeah,

2720
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:23,810
yeah.

2721
02:05:23,810 --> 02:05:27,000
I know talking about those,
I think those rocket arena,

2722
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:30,030
there was like a rocket to read a map
where you could play quake and the

2723
02:05:30,031 --> 02:05:34,320
bathroom was my favorite.
I've spent days on that.

2724
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,030
Well,
there was a bunch of maps that people

2725
02:05:36,031 --> 02:05:37,350
would create,
you know,

2726
02:05:37,351 --> 02:05:40,440
and there was even map making software
and you could,

2727
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:43,680
you could make a bap and guys were
always doing it.

2728
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:45,360
It was,
it was a really common thing.

2729
02:05:45,361 --> 02:05:47,730
There was a joe rogan level.
Remember somebody made that.

2730
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,043
Oh,
with the jre?

2731
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:50,310
Yeah.
Look a little logo.

2732
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:52,500
I think so.
I think someone did do something like

2733
02:05:52,501 --> 02:05:53,160
that.
I remember that,

2734
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:56,010
but it's a.
I remember they would do all these new

2735
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:59,250
maps would come out and we would play
matches on these new maps.

2736
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:01,290
You'd kick my ass till five in the
morning,

2737
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,310
dude.
you're like,

2738
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:03,450
no,
don't get off yet.

2739
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:06,750
I had a real problem.
The real problem with games,

2740
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:09,840
you know,
doing my best,

2741
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:13,110
doing my best to avoid them,
but we're going to indulge a little bit

2742
02:06:13,111 --> 02:06:14,100
here.
Virtual reality,

2743
02:06:14,101 --> 02:06:15,570
man,
that's my.

2744
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:18,540
That's my favorite man.
I can't get an I love it.

2745
02:06:18,541 --> 02:06:22,510
And now you could play like,
was it doom or first person shooter?

2746
02:06:22,511 --> 02:06:25,370
I forget which one it assumes on there
and follow up for us on that.

2747
02:06:25,371 --> 02:06:26,380
Yeah.
You play doom.

2748
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:28,620
Doom in vr.
Can you show me that?

2749
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:31,010
Show me doom in vr.
Which doom is it?

2750
02:06:31,011 --> 02:06:33,280
Is it the more recent tickets?
The original.

2751
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:34,760
The original design?
It probably.

2752
02:06:34,770 --> 02:06:37,500
I think so,
but it's probably like the cpu power

2753
02:06:37,501 --> 02:06:40,500
probably isn't able to keep up.
I want to upgrade my age.

2754
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:43,560
This is not the original one.
It's an upgraded version of it.

2755
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:44,190
Oh,
is it?

2756
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:46,380
Oh,
just upgraded graphics of this.

2757
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:48,600
Um,
this does not look like this.

2758
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:52,260
Looks like the newer ones took the
original doom and remade it remastered

2759
02:06:52,261 --> 02:06:53,100
if you will,
is what it's called.

2760
02:06:53,101 --> 02:06:55,520
That's crazy.
I actually bought this.

2761
02:06:56,230 --> 02:06:59,130
So this is doom vfr,
which is a special vr version and I

2762
02:06:59,131 --> 02:07:02,070
think they might've have some levels.
I don't know if it's the actual full

2763
02:07:02,071 --> 02:07:04,800
game from start to finish.
oh my god dude.

2764
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,580
But when you said it's the original
game,

2765
02:07:08,581 --> 02:07:10,620
I thought you meant like with the
original graphics,

2766
02:07:10,621 --> 02:07:13,290
these graphics are really good.
This is,

2767
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:16,980
this will fuck your life up.
I said I could've brought it.

2768
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:19,440
We should do this,
this right here to fuck your life up.

2769
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:21,370
This looks way too fun.
You don't have virtual reality.

2770
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:23,070
You have virtual reality at your house.
No.

2771
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:24,990
Oh,
you got to get her to go running.

2772
02:07:24,991 --> 02:07:26,070
I work out.
Do things.

2773
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:27,900
Oh,
we don't want them to do that anymore,

2774
02:07:27,901 --> 02:07:28,734
man.

2775
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:33,540
That scared the shit out of me.
That legitimately scared the shit out of

2776
02:07:33,541 --> 02:07:36,500
me that watching that video,
the doom because was like,

2777
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:40,120
that could ruin my life.
Did the features liposuction as kanye

2778
02:07:40,121 --> 02:07:43,720
man,
liposuction opioids and playing virtual

2779
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:47,020
reality to them until it shrivel up.
I'm trying to make 1:30.

2780
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:51,610
That's how you do it.
Just just play video games all day.

2781
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:53,290
You never eat.
Stay quito.

2782
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:59,710
What games do you play in a.
I just got a god of war.

2783
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:01,330
The new god of war,
which that looks.

2784
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:03,810
You want to see graphics.
That's amazing graphics.

2785
02:08:03,811 --> 02:08:05,740
So to me,
I saw one in the commercial,

2786
02:08:05,741 --> 02:08:06,980
but it looks incredible.
Yeah,

2787
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:11,290
it's that and that's a real fun game.
I tried to get into far cry five,

2788
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:14,650
but I like the color aspect.
Like at first I,

2789
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:16,780
I,
I told duncan trussell you have to buy

2790
02:08:16,781 --> 02:08:20,800
this immediately because there was,
is this is a real walk through gameplay.

2791
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,130
Gameplay.
Gameplay.

2792
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:23,951
Yeah.
Loading screen.

2793
02:08:23,951 --> 02:08:27,760
There's no game to look at them.
The steam coming out of his mouth.

2794
02:08:27,761 --> 02:08:29,920
This is incredible.
Yeah,

2795
02:08:29,921 --> 02:08:31,060
and no,
like you said,

2796
02:08:31,061 --> 02:08:33,260
no loads screens.
It goes in like,

2797
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:36,190
that's just the game dude.
This is nuts.

2798
02:08:36,260 --> 02:08:40,150
Yeah.
That's the third person.

2799
02:08:40,151 --> 02:08:41,410
Or do you do it?
First person.

2800
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:42,630
Keep this going,
jamie,

2801
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:45,760
to show you some cool shit on it.
Jamie's real cliquey today.

2802
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:49,390
Notice quickly is that adderall is going
crazy.

2803
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:51,990
Going crazy.
Oh yeah.

2804
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:55,900
Oh my god.
This is nuts.

2805
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:57,160
Yeah.
Do that again.

2806
02:08:59,490 --> 02:09:00,090
Well,
not all the way.

2807
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:02,010
All the way to the beginning.
I want to see like how they set it up

2808
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,870
to help him out.
I'm actually shooting it.

2809
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:13,950
Are good.
Do playing this shooting in the head.

2810
02:09:14,670 --> 02:09:16,770
He's trying to.
Why would you do that?

2811
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,350
Because you know.
Go.

2812
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:22,110
There you go.
Good,

2813
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:24,061
good.
Thanks.

2814
02:09:24,061 --> 02:09:24,894
Tait fletcher.

2815
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:27,740
This is real.
This is real clunky.

2816
02:09:27,741 --> 02:09:31,100
Looking like it doesn't look real,
but it looks way realer than anything

2817
02:09:31,101 --> 02:09:33,950
I've ever seen before.
So this is check this out.

2818
02:09:33,951 --> 02:09:35,660
This is actually like,
this is.

2819
02:09:35,661 --> 02:09:40,010
You're battling some of you guys trying
to kill you with that big rock.

2820
02:09:40,030 --> 02:09:40,863
Yeah,

2821
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:45,160
it's a.
Games are amazing now.

2822
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:47,640
shadows and everything.
It's incredible.

2823
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:50,070
Yeah.
Well what I'm saying is that like,

2824
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:54,090
I mean this obviously looks amazing,
but in how many years do you think it

2825
02:09:54,091 --> 02:09:55,710
will be indistinguishable from real
life?

2826
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:57,030
10,
20,

2827
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:58,200
20 for short,
right?

2828
02:09:59,150 --> 02:10:03,420
In 20 years you don't think so.
Sort of skeptical on this a little bit

2829
02:10:03,421 --> 02:10:05,880
because I feel like the bar keeps
getting moved at five years,

2830
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:07,230
10 years.
Every couple of years.

2831
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:09,330
We get,
we get close skeptic over here.

2832
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:11,610
We get close but it's still like the
window,

2833
02:10:11,650 --> 02:10:12,840
the window.
You get your first five.

2834
02:10:12,930 --> 02:10:15,410
It was,
it's been four or five years I've had or

2835
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:19,200
the oculus rift since beta testing,
so I've had always had it and I just had

2836
02:10:19,201 --> 02:10:23,040
a big vr la thing this weekend and I
didn't hear anyone sharing anything that

2837
02:10:23,041 --> 02:10:27,150
was like mind blowing experiences that
are making everyone go out and spend

2838
02:10:27,151 --> 02:10:29,520
$2,000 on a vr rig.
Well,

2839
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:33,950
I Think right now what's happening is
the infancy of vr in a commercial level.

2840
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:35,270
That's what we're seeing.
I mean,

2841
02:10:35,271 --> 02:10:39,290
it's like if you go back to the early
day at targhee boxes and then compare

2842
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:41,380
them to a new xbox.
I mean,

2843
02:10:41,381 --> 02:10:43,520
I think that's where we're looking at.
You're just saying that it's not

2844
02:10:43,521 --> 02:10:47,050
happening quick.
Those definitely happens.

2845
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:49,940
Those are gigantic gaps,
but you can look at it from a different

2846
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:52,490
perspective and be like,
it's still just playing with the remote

2847
02:10:52,491 --> 02:10:55,340
control on a tv with some computer power
behind it.

2848
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:59,840
And even those virtual stuff is also
sometimes connected to those three

2849
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:01,110
dimensional.
Um,

2850
02:11:01,470 --> 02:11:03,730
uh,
one of those things that,

2851
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:06,440
how do they call them?
They don't call the treadmill,

2852
02:11:06,441 --> 02:11:08,000
what do they call them?
new track omnisphere.

2853
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,291
Yeah.
That thing,

2854
02:11:09,291 --> 02:11:10,160
have you seen that thing?
Yeah,

2855
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:12,290
you're strapped into the center of this
thing and it moves.

2856
02:11:12,291 --> 02:11:14,540
The rest of you could walk through these
three d environments,

2857
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:16,760
but you know if you.

2858
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:18,680
But if I was gonna save just 20 years
ago,

2859
02:11:18,681 --> 02:11:22,880
what kind of bullshit ass graphics were
we looking at and now look at what we're

2860
02:11:22,881 --> 02:11:25,460
looking at now.
They just 20 years from now they'll

2861
02:11:25,461 --> 02:11:29,810
probably have it like at the very least
it'd be like watching marijuana or

2862
02:11:29,811 --> 02:11:31,130
something.
That's what I just still feel like it

2863
02:11:31,131 --> 02:11:34,280
was still feel super fake,
will still know that this is still a big

2864
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:37,490
world and it's not going to ever get
lost in it pretty.

2865
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:40,250
I think it's easy to get lost in it
nowadays.

2866
02:11:40,251 --> 02:11:44,360
They have big rooms almost like size of
chuck cheese where you renting out in so

2867
02:11:44,361 --> 02:11:47,150
you don't need a treadmill because
you're actually going through obstacles

2868
02:11:47,151 --> 02:11:50,180
that are feel real.
Like they would if they did it in a way

2869
02:11:50,181 --> 02:11:52,930
where it's like it's,
it's,

2870
02:11:53,830 --> 02:11:56,420
it's not realistic,
but it's really good.

2871
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:59,630
Like,
like what if they did despicable me?

2872
02:11:59,810 --> 02:12:04,810
Like you were in despicable me.
You know the animated movie with the.

2873
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:07,970
What's the dude's name,
the fucking bad guy.

2874
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:11,090
I know you're damaged.
Yes.

2875
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:14,000
I forget.
Is the bad guy in the character's name?

2876
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:16,170
That was a group except like that.
Is that his name?

2877
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:17,930
Honestly,
I don't have any candy.

2878
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:20,870
I have kids,
but the graphics are incredible.

2879
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:23,570
It's beautiful.
I mean it's stunning to look at it like,

2880
02:12:23,571 --> 02:12:25,820
wow,
they did an amazing job with this,

2881
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:29,000
but it's obviously not real.
You know what I'm saying?

2882
02:12:29,001 --> 02:12:31,610
You wanted to be like,
like that or like extra,

2883
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:35,510
not just a simulation of your life.
You'd want to be able to fly early,

2884
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:37,850
you know,
jump over fucking buildings.

2885
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:40,370
You've gone.
You've done the simpsons game right in

2886
02:12:40,371 --> 02:12:43,070
universal fucking incredible.
Right.

2887
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:45,820
So good to ride the ride.
Yeah.

2888
02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:46,270
Well the.
Yeah.

2889
02:12:46,270 --> 02:12:49,340
So again,
that ride where it's this huge video

2890
02:12:49,341 --> 02:12:52,820
screen and your,
your car moves up and down and they're

2891
02:12:52,821 --> 02:12:55,940
just taking you through this crazy thing
that you're seeing in front of you and

2892
02:12:55,941 --> 02:13:00,941
it's probably as thrilling as any actual
ride where you're really moving.

2893
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:03,020
Right.
Is the back of the future ride though?

2894
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:05,840
Before that?
I didn't see that one because then 40

2895
02:13:05,841 --> 02:13:08,000
yet the 40 theaters out here.
no,

2896
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:09,590
that's what you try,
Man.

2897
02:13:09,591 --> 02:13:13,130
That's where you're.
The whole thing moves with the movie and

2898
02:13:13,150 --> 02:13:16,940
there's also smell.
There's also missed and potter.

2899
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:17,930
Yeah,
it's.

2900
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:20,360
It looked like ivan pukey kind of.
Is it like that?

2901
02:13:20,361 --> 02:13:23,570
Star wars ride star tours at disneyland.
You ever done that?

2902
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:25,490
Yeah.
It's kind of like that.

2903
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:28,460
Yeah,
the moves and you could turn off like,

2904
02:13:28,461 --> 02:13:30,740
I don't want water.
I don't want to fart.

2905
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,580
There will be something like that.
I feel like I was trying to look it up

2906
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:37,500
right now,
but I remember steven spielberg talking

2907
02:13:37,501 --> 02:13:42,501
about developing a room type theater
process process.

2908
02:13:42,721 --> 02:13:42,980
We're.
You're not.

2909
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:46,440
Maybe you're not wearing anything,
but things are being projected into the

2910
02:13:46,441 --> 02:13:49,440
room you're in and you're experiencing
the movie like that.

2911
02:13:49,441 --> 02:13:53,100
Like maybe like avatar in the future
would be like 25 people jump into the

2912
02:13:53,101 --> 02:13:56,700
room and it starts playing and you're
just experiencing it happen around you

2913
02:13:56,970 --> 02:14:00,390
versus wearing a headset and watching
something happen.

2914
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:03,860
I don't think they've developed it yet,
but I have seen some beautiful in

2915
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:04,591
holograms,
man.

2916
02:14:04,591 --> 02:14:07,280
Some big globe globes is happening in
vegas.

2917
02:14:07,730 --> 02:14:08,960
Right.
I think I Just told you about that.

2918
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:10,170
Gm is doing something weird.

2919
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:11,910
Yeah.
I think group things are going to be

2920
02:14:11,911 --> 02:14:15,060
really interesting in that too.
Like everybody experiencing that in a

2921
02:14:15,061 --> 02:14:18,150
group the same way you experience like a
movie in a group,

2922
02:14:18,450 --> 02:14:20,040
you know,
it's entirely possible that they'll

2923
02:14:20,041 --> 02:14:21,920
develop something like that,
right?

2924
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:25,950
Where they'll have warehouses where
people meet up and everybody goes into

2925
02:14:25,951 --> 02:14:29,640
these virtual worlds together.
Like you go on missions and shit,

2926
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:35,300
just wear something that's a,
it's tuned in to the wifi signal of the

2927
02:14:36,271 --> 02:14:39,270
building and you're wearing like a
lightweight helmet,

2928
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:44,100
like a bicycle helmet with straps on.
So it's not substance really cumbersome,

2929
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:47,370
but you know,
it has enough battery life and enough

2930
02:14:47,371 --> 02:14:49,360
juice to get you through a one hour game
or

2931
02:14:51,070 --> 02:14:54,410
they have vr experiences where you can
go with your whole family and you're all

2932
02:14:54,411 --> 02:14:56,220
in the game wearing these things and
you,

2933
02:14:56,350 --> 02:14:58,340
uh,
you're in the game together.

2934
02:14:58,370 --> 02:14:59,240
Damn.
Yeah.

2935
02:14:59,570 --> 02:15:01,910
What kind of games of any like virtual
reality games,

2936
02:15:01,911 --> 02:15:04,130
like they have the zombie game.
Oh,

2937
02:15:04,131 --> 02:15:05,900
so you're running from zombies and a
warehouse.

2938
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2939
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:10,640
I think I hold a link from a good
mythical morning.

2940
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:14,240
He was talking about how he brought the
family and he was getting chased by

2941
02:15:14,241 --> 02:15:16,740
zombies and I had heard that there were

2942
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:18,330
thinking about doing something like
that.

2943
02:15:18,331 --> 02:15:20,550
Now that you think of it,
but I didn't know there was an actually

2944
02:15:20,551 --> 02:15:21,390
a place now.
Yeah.

2945
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:25,670
And roller coaster before I feel like we
talked about in Utah.

2946
02:15:25,671 --> 02:15:26,930
Right,
right.

2947
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:28,100
Remember looking it up right now.

2948
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:29,990
Yeah.
Like,

2949
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:32,750
but I think that's the future.
I think the future,

2950
02:15:32,751 --> 02:15:36,860
this is like you go to a football field
and it's like a virtual game is being

2951
02:15:36,861 --> 02:15:38,150
played,
you know,

2952
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:42,140
but then you've got to stop people from
like physically assaulting each other in

2953
02:15:42,141 --> 02:15:43,070
the virtual world.

2954
02:15:43,370 --> 02:15:45,390
Yeah.
You have to have a babysitter it anyway.

2955
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:45,630
Right.

2956
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:47,640
Now remember this,
he'd get off an elevator.

2957
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:50,200
The future of virtual reality time
magazines

2958
02:15:51,070 --> 02:15:53,550
avoid,
let's say if a ghostbusters experience

2959
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:54,560
and ones.

2960
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:55,830
Yeah.
Look at that.

2961
02:15:56,730 --> 02:15:58,780
This incredible.
And that's cool because you're in there

2962
02:15:58,820 --> 02:16:01,920
in the game with your friend,
like you could see your friends,

2963
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,570
you're in a room with them essentially.
Yeah.

2964
02:16:03,610 --> 02:16:06,760
So now you're wandering around and see
what they're seeing.

2965
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:10,110
We get to see what they're saying.
This is going to blow their minds.

2966
02:16:10,111 --> 02:16:11,650
Says the verge.
Wow.

2967
02:16:12,910 --> 02:16:15,940
Fuck yeah,
it's already here then.

2968
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:17,860
So this is one place that has this?

2969
02:16:18,010 --> 02:16:18,701
I believe so,
yeah.

2970
02:16:18,701 --> 02:16:20,920
I don't know.
There's a place here right across the

2971
02:16:20,921 --> 02:16:23,050
street from the grove that's like the
imax vr thing,

2972
02:16:23,051 --> 02:16:25,180
but I don't think it's,
it's definitely not this.

2973
02:16:25,330 --> 02:16:26,290
But they might have some similar.

2974
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:29,050
I definitely have way too many of these
stories.

2975
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,003
My head,

2976
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:33,760
I don't know how many of them are real.
How many of them did I make that up?

2977
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:35,460
Well,
when I went to the,

2978
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:39,460
did the house of comedy in the mall of
America across from it.

2979
02:16:39,461 --> 02:16:40,240
It's great,
great,

2980
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:42,970
huge.
But they have like their,

2981
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:43,983
like,
uh,

2982
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:47,830
across from it they have a virtual
reality arcade where it's a one is

2983
02:16:47,831 --> 02:16:50,230
skydiving where you're hanging.
Well it,

2984
02:16:50,270 --> 02:16:52,270
you know.
And that was the whole thing,

2985
02:16:52,271 --> 02:16:54,250
like you could tell that's going to
become more popular,

2986
02:16:54,251 --> 02:16:55,900
kind of like a,
a whatever.

2987
02:16:55,901 --> 02:16:58,840
Those arcades are everywhere in anaheim.
Yeah,

2988
02:16:58,990 --> 02:17:03,340
they do.
So it says downtown disney star wars.

2989
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:05,600
Oh,
is that a new?

2990
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,090
Yeah.
Oh wow.

2991
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:08,373
I did

2992
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:10,650
soaring over the world.
Do you ever do that?

2993
02:17:11,610 --> 02:17:14,250
That's a disneyland.
It's a giant screen.

2994
02:17:14,310 --> 02:17:15,870
I've only been at disney once and it was
bad.

2995
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:20,460
You sit down in your chair and you get
lifted up and it takes you towards this

2996
02:17:20,461 --> 02:17:24,100
giant screen.
And on this giant screen you,

2997
02:17:24,101 --> 02:17:26,790
you sore all over these different parts
of the world.

2998
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:28,740
Oh cool dude.
It's fucking crazy.

2999
02:17:28,770 --> 02:17:32,820
The ride is amazing.
You fly over all these different spots

3000
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:36,810
and uh,
you experienced all this like is if

3001
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:41,820
you're soaring and you feel like a light
breeze and there's different smells that

3002
02:17:41,821 --> 02:17:44,100
they send your way,
like the older one was soaring over

3003
02:17:44,101 --> 02:17:46,500
California.
You would look at this as bears like,

3004
02:17:46,501 --> 02:17:47,300
what are you doing,
bitch

3005
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:50,900
john,
you would soar over these orange trees.

3006
02:17:50,901 --> 02:17:53,050
That bear looks so fake by the way,
right?

3007
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:54,460
Oh yeah.
Are they cooking?

3008
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:55,470
Bear

3009
02:17:55,470 --> 02:17:56,303
get out of here,
bitch,

3010
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:59,010
um,
but the other one was soaring over

3011
02:17:59,011 --> 02:18:00,630
California,
which was pretty amazing too.

3012
02:18:00,631 --> 02:18:03,360
And you soar with the oranges.
You'd smell him.

3013
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:06,960
He'd smell the water from the beach and
you,

3014
02:18:06,980 --> 02:18:08,400
uh,
things like that will happen.

3015
02:18:08,401 --> 02:18:10,080
Like the water will splash in front of
your face.

3016
02:18:10,081 --> 02:18:12,690
Then all of a sudden you're being in
paris or you'll be somewhere else.

3017
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:13,673
It's fucking awesome.

3018
02:18:14,150 --> 02:18:16,170
Yeah.
I have that ethic.

3019
02:18:16,670 --> 02:18:19,350
Dairy talked about this on here.
I walk the plank.

3020
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:21,540
I can't remember,
I said it on an chair wrote on your

3021
02:18:21,541 --> 02:18:25,260
podcast or a,
it's a real piece of wood and I have

3022
02:18:25,261 --> 02:18:28,290
like it unbalanced would wear something
underneath it.

3023
02:18:28,291 --> 02:18:30,180
So it kind of rocks if you're standing
on it.

3024
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:33,630
Uh,
so you go up in this elevator in virtual

3025
02:18:33,631 --> 02:18:38,190
reality road and I have a fan that I
turn on right when the elevator door

3026
02:18:38,191 --> 02:18:42,180
opens
and you feel like you're walking on the

3027
02:18:42,181 --> 02:18:44,670
side of the building,
like on this plank.

3028
02:18:44,671 --> 02:18:45,930
And it,
I have my,

3029
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:49,120
I have my board kind of rocky,
so yeah,

3030
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:50,290
I just want us to,
uh,

3031
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:52,470
uh,
and I can't do it.

3032
02:18:52,530 --> 02:18:53,520
I get halfway through it.
I,

3033
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:58,540
I shit myself and andy was funny and uh,
I pushed my girlfriend off the board.

3034
02:19:00,250 --> 02:19:03,120
She was like freaking out and I just
gave her a little nudge and she goes,

3035
02:19:03,150 --> 02:19:05,340
oh,
and in the game if you fall off,

3036
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:07,200
you fall down.
Oh my god.

3037
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:12,640
Is that my girlfriend
now?

3038
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:15,270
This is crazy.
Is this a new thing?

3039
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:16,410
Uh,
yeah.

3040
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:19,050
I think it's for the vive.
Vive.

3041
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:20,520
Yeah.
And they have a new vibe out.

3042
02:19:20,521 --> 02:19:23,340
I need to get a better resolution and
stuff.

3043
02:19:23,341 --> 02:19:25,450
And supposedly they have a wireless
adapters.

3044
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:27,830
You don't have all the cables anymore.
A

3045
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:31,220
coming soon.
I think the world is the most addictive

3046
02:19:31,221 --> 02:19:34,430
archery game ever have.
Those little monsters are trying to

3047
02:19:34,431 --> 02:19:36,920
attack the castle.
Have you played arrows at them?

3048
02:19:37,060 --> 02:19:40,250
Vertical virtual pool is cool to use it.
Yeah,

3049
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:41,840
because you have like,
you know,

3050
02:19:41,841 --> 02:19:43,280
you have controllers and you can,
like,

3051
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:45,800
it's,
it's pretty realistic for.

3052
02:19:45,801 --> 02:19:47,720
You could play pool.
Yeah.

3053
02:19:47,721 --> 02:19:50,960
But if you could only play virtual pool,
regular pool,

3054
02:19:50,961 --> 02:19:53,040
be so fucking amazing.
If you don't to.

3055
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:55,640
Oh my god,
it's a real table.

3056
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:57,500
Look at the cloth.
I can feel it.

3057
02:19:57,740 --> 02:19:59,750
Look,
I can watch the balls click together.

3058
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,630
The real,
the real in front of me like,

3059
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,310
well,
I'd rather have a control where they're

3060
02:20:04,311 --> 02:20:06,450
pretends with my finger.
I'm going to control what they're

3061
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,380
pretended to stick.
Yeah,

3062
02:20:08,870 --> 02:20:10,620
but you could also be playing it on
moon,

3063
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:14,720
on the moon.
Can't be playing on the men in your tiny

3064
02:20:14,721 --> 02:20:16,460
little apartment where you don't have
space for a table.

3065
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:19,310
That's true too.
Yeah.

3066
02:20:19,311 --> 02:20:21,530
There's video games.
You can play a two on your phone,

3067
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:24,650
but I've never even thought about it
critically.

3068
02:20:25,230 --> 02:20:29,420
Kate quigley's and she's in a virtual
reality porn.

3069
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:32,240
Oh boy.
She's not naked and she's sitting there,

3070
02:20:32,241 --> 02:20:35,810
but she's getting molested by a naked
girl and it's weird because when you're

3071
02:20:35,811 --> 02:20:38,250
in the virtual rail road,
your kate quigley.

3072
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:40,100
Whoa.
You are her.

3073
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,700
Jesus.
It's so weird because I had a side gig.

3074
02:20:49,950 --> 02:20:51,200
Oh good.
For her,

3075
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:55,670
that's a virtual.
Porn has got to be a big market.

3076
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:58,550
Yeah.
It's not as good as I was hoping for.

3077
02:20:58,610 --> 02:20:59,480
No.
Yeah,

3078
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:01,790
that was weird about it.
I just like in your head,

3079
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:02,980
you think it's going to be like,
oh,

3080
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:06,110
this is realistic.
I was going to make masturbating way mit

3081
02:21:06,111 --> 02:21:08,720
better,
but it's still clunky because all the

3082
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:10,850
companies that make virtual reality
porn,

3083
02:21:10,851 --> 02:21:15,851
they're not making like perfect
masterpiece is they're still filming it.

3084
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:19,430
Sloppy and edited.
Sloppy damage for the most part.

3085
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:21,200
I mean,
unless I haven't seen all of it,

3086
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:25,610
but this is just a setup for brian's new
career as a porn director of virtual

3087
02:21:25,611 --> 02:21:27,440
reality.
These people don't know what the fuck

3088
02:21:27,441 --> 02:21:29,150
they're doing.
Let me show you how it's done.

3089
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:30,680
Did you do the avatar?
One,

3090
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:32,120
two?
No,

3091
02:21:32,121 --> 02:21:33,890
I did not.
Is that a recent one?

3092
02:21:34,190 --> 02:21:34,390
Yeah.

3093
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:36,590
Disney world avatar.
Just open every time.

3094
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:40,760
Yeah,
that must be amazing.

3095
02:21:40,761 --> 02:21:43,070
It's the real disney for.
They're going to do a,

3096
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:47,330
um,
some crazy giant star wars thing out

3097
02:21:47,331 --> 02:21:48,164
here.
Right.

3098
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:51,320
That's going to be awesome.
Yeah,

3099
02:21:51,321 --> 02:21:53,780
man,
it's just weird.

3100
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:56,510
It's just a matter of time till there's
going to be something like that at a

3101
02:21:56,511 --> 02:21:57,810
consumer level.
Like,

3102
02:21:57,811 --> 02:22:00,920
like the avatar game.
That seems like pretty doable.

3103
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:03,770
Maybe.
Maybe I just got a little cynical view

3104
02:22:03,771 --> 02:22:04,660
on it,
just like maybe,

3105
02:22:04,970 --> 02:22:06,730
maybe not super cynical,
jamie.

3106
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:10,910
I like vr chat.
That's my favorite thing in the whole

3107
02:22:10,911 --> 02:22:13,400
entire world right now.
Talking to people in vr.

3108
02:22:13,430 --> 02:22:14,190
Yeah,
it's.

3109
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:16,400
It reminds me of the old days of the
internet,

3110
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:19,650
like when.
I don't know what would it be messaged?

3111
02:22:19,651 --> 02:22:21,410
Sports first came out or something.
It's just like,

3112
02:22:21,411 --> 02:22:24,440
oh,
why like the wild wild west right now.

3113
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:25,470
Whoa,
this crazy.

3114
02:22:25,530 --> 02:22:26,160
And you could be

3115
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:30,900
anyone like I'm windy and you can go to
a wendy's in there in all the windies

3116
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:35,370
characters together a look.
There's semen pekichu,

3117
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,960
so people just get together in these
rooms to hang out together.

3118
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:41,370
Talk to the musicians that are just sit
there and play songs for you,

3119
02:22:41,371 --> 02:22:45,870
but as dressed up as a.
Are you talking in your voice?

3120
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:47,093
Yeah,
it's here,

3121
02:22:47,370 --> 02:22:50,130
but some people use voice changers and
stuff like that.

3122
02:22:50,131 --> 02:22:50,964
Some people just.

3123
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:54,120
Hello,
my name is missy.

3124
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:58,590
A lot of racist people on there.
If you leave people alone,

3125
02:22:58,591 --> 02:23:02,850
they just become racist.
You give them notes,

3126
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:06,060
those schooling,
do you know the way and put them inside

3127
02:23:06,061 --> 02:23:08,700
of a video game with no repercussions
for their actions.

3128
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:11,760
That's the internet.
Especially if you could be like a little

3129
02:23:11,761 --> 02:23:14,400
girl,
I'd say terrible and words.

3130
02:23:15,010 --> 02:23:16,790
You know,
a little.

3131
02:23:16,791 --> 02:23:21,410
A blonde girl on the screen for me while
you're a 40 year old man from the bronx.

3132
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:24,840
Probably didn't check it,
but the instagram update yesterday said

3133
02:23:24,841 --> 02:23:29,841
something about they're blocking words.
Bullies like that as well.

3134
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:33,540
I wonder what other people are fucking
assholes with that man.

3135
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:38,130
Again,
assholes with the being mean to people

3136
02:23:38,131 --> 02:23:40,290
online.
It's a new toy.

3137
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:44,010
We don't to do it yet.
It's also revealing a lot of people that

3138
02:23:44,011 --> 02:23:46,230
you didn't know,
like a lot of people that you never got

3139
02:23:46,231 --> 02:23:48,900
in contact with.
Just really shitty people mean.

3140
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:53,640
I'm only mean to companies like I.
I've switched to my online bullying to

3141
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:58,670
only talking about bad services service
at restaurants or delivery service.

3142
02:23:58,790 --> 02:24:03,630
That's
well if it's warranted.

3143
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:05,520
Yeah,
that's what I say,

3144
02:24:05,521 --> 02:24:08,420
but people get mad at me for like when I
posted those things.

3145
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:10,380
I can put some of the other day at this
chicken place.

3146
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:13,770
They burned everything.
They sent me like everything.

3147
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:16,440
Like the corn on the cob was black.
That chicken was black.

3148
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:18,870
I had to throw it away and I was late
too.

3149
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:24,250
Be the chef and the lady working of the
counter and they weren't paying

3150
02:24:24,251 --> 02:24:25,090
attention.
Eat chicken.

3151
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:28,220
It's probably some 14 year old kid.
Frequent problem.

3152
02:24:28,390 --> 02:24:29,420
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

3153
02:24:29,421 --> 02:24:30,850
Probably some kid who wasn't paying
attention.

3154
02:24:31,150 --> 02:24:36,150
I just had a good fantasy of what was
really happening.

3155
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,730
It was fun.
I fucked in a frigerator of restaurant.

3156
02:24:41,140 --> 02:24:45,320
Hey houlihan's easy fella.
Uh,

3157
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:47,120
uh,
dated a girl.

3158
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:48,850
Worked at uh,
newport creamery with me.

3159
02:24:50,840 --> 02:24:51,670
What's that like?
A,

3160
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:54,880
like a cold stone ice cream place that
served hamburgers.

3161
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:58,240
Who's that?
You remember me.

3162
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,000
It's me.
This fucking phone.

3163
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:04,150
I've got a phone that for whatever
reason,

3164
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:06,170
turns itself on to ring all the time.
Yeah.

3165
02:25:06,370 --> 02:25:08,860
Like even when I don't,
it turns the cell phone to ring.

3166
02:25:09,220 --> 02:25:10,053
It's done it like twice.

3167
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:11,250
You know what?
I think it's this case,

3168
02:25:11,251 --> 02:25:14,490
this leather apple case.
I think it's a piece of shit.

3169
02:25:14,510 --> 02:25:17,490
Like look at your volume buttons,
look at mine.

3170
02:25:17,550 --> 02:25:21,870
They're sunk in the middle.
Like this suddenly had this like a for a

3171
02:25:21,870 --> 02:25:24,030
week and it's already falling apart.
None not

3172
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:26,230
join it.
Overheats your phone.

3173
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:28,990
I think because of the leather,
there's no way for the air to get out.

3174
02:25:28,991 --> 02:25:31,210
So my shit's running slower than it
should.

3175
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:33,580
You don't have to do the other day.
I put a battery pack on this.

3176
02:25:33,581 --> 02:25:34,690
Like a madman.
A?

3177
02:25:34,770 --> 02:25:35,603
Yeah.
Yeah,

3178
02:25:35,610 --> 02:25:39,260
put one of them thick ass battery packs
on it felt like a superhero.

3179
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:43,060
I could just go all day.
Why don't you have it on now?

3180
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:45,970
Because I took it off because I feel
like it was relying on it too much.

3181
02:25:46,950 --> 02:25:51,950
I should just charge it at night.
I'm using my phone less and less after

3182
02:25:52,091 --> 02:25:56,020
my trip to Hawaii because my phone broke
a dropped it the first day there and I

3183
02:25:56,021 --> 02:25:56,920
had to order a new one.

3184
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:00,280
I mean mine to stop working.
The whole thing?

3185
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:02,020
Yeah.
Duty would just randomly call people.

3186
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:06,670
I would hold up,
I would hold up my contacts and it would

3187
02:26:06,671 --> 02:26:10,600
just start calling people and then I
would hang up and it would start calling

3188
02:26:10,601 --> 02:26:11,350
another person.
No,

3189
02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:13,150
hang up.
It was dark and I was showing people.

3190
02:26:13,151 --> 02:26:14,670
It's like my friend John Dudley.
I was like,

3191
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:18,040
watch this watch was doing and then I'd
hang up and we'll do that again.

3192
02:26:18,041 --> 02:26:18,930
I was like,
what the fuck?

3193
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:21,190
I just dropped it and just went haywire.
That's crazy.

3194
02:26:21,191 --> 02:26:22,024
Yeah,
I broke it.

3195
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:22,983
And so,
uh,

3196
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:26,380
when I got a new one for three days I
wasn't doing anything.

3197
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:28,390
So for three days waiting for my phone
to come,

3198
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:30,400
I didn't use any apps,
any,

3199
02:26:30,401 --> 02:26:32,350
nothing.
And I felt better.

3200
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:35,110
I felt better.
But you're in Hawaii?

3201
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:36,033
Yeah.
Yeah.

3202
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:37,840
Were in van.
Nice.

3203
02:26:37,870 --> 02:26:39,370
But as soon as I got the phone back
again,

3204
02:26:39,371 --> 02:26:39,911
like,
hmm,

3205
02:26:39,911 --> 02:26:43,440
let me check instagram.
Anybody put any cool pictures of cars up

3206
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:46,450
technology,
so frat and like that.

3207
02:26:46,451 --> 02:26:48,370
Then why are we still so scared of like
ai?

3208
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:51,120
If we could just fucking smack it and
the breads a silly way to look at

3209
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:52,930
nuclear bombs.
Jamie,

3210
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:58,000
that's technology to remember that said
it was silly.

3211
02:26:58,001 --> 02:27:01,810
I started off by saying smoke too much
weed,

3212
02:27:01,811 --> 02:27:02,870
dude.
A dude,

3213
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:04,990
uh,
or not enough.

3214
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:07,333
Hmm.

3215
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:09,520
Huh?
We should be worried.

3216
02:27:09,521 --> 02:27:11,680
Don't you think if elon musk thinks we
should be worried.

3217
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:15,410
He's like in the business of that though
of worrying people.

3218
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:15,781
No,
no,

3219
02:27:15,781 --> 02:27:17,280
no,
but I mean of technology.

3220
02:27:17,281 --> 02:27:18,390
It's key.
Yeah.

3221
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:19,253
Well also,
yeah.

3222
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:22,140
Yeah.
That's not the business 100 percent.

3223
02:27:22,410 --> 02:27:24,600
One hundred percent.
But like that's his business.

3224
02:27:24,601 --> 02:27:28,110
Thirty five percent future of all
technology.

3225
02:27:28,111 --> 02:27:30,060
He's,
he's the one figuring out the problems.

3226
02:27:30,061 --> 02:27:31,800
He was the one here to save us from all
of this shit.

3227
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:37,050
That's his business that he created.
All those tesla's got recalled.

3228
02:27:37,051 --> 02:27:38,220
I mean,
did you saw that?

3229
02:27:38,221 --> 02:27:40,620
Right?
Like $130,000 model ss got recalled

3230
02:27:40,621 --> 02:27:42,240
because they're steering column was
fucked up or something.

3231
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:43,770
Is that what happened?
I don't know the exact problem,

3232
02:27:43,771 --> 02:27:44,610
but a lot of them.

3233
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:47,860
I remember seeing something.
How crazy is it?

3234
02:27:47,870 --> 02:27:50,620
Ford canceled all their current.
Callan loves his.

3235
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:52,810
He fucking loves it.
Yeah.

3236
02:27:52,811 --> 02:27:56,210
Ford decided to start making cars except
the motherfucking mustang.

3237
02:27:57,250 --> 02:27:59,450
An suv is I think,
well their suv,

3238
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:01,630
they're awesome.
They make that lincoln town.

3239
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:03,160
What is it not?
I'm good.

3240
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:05,440
Why did they make it?
That's lincoln navigator,

3241
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:08,130
this new navigator.
It's a fucking incredible car.

3242
02:28:08,350 --> 02:28:09,870
It's incredible.
It's like they.

3243
02:28:09,871 --> 02:28:14,871
They saw all these other cars like that
luxury suv family wagon market is a

3244
02:28:16,751 --> 02:28:19,900
weird market.
Like there's range rovers and there's a

3245
02:28:19,901 --> 02:28:24,901
bunch of mercedes suv and bmw suv,
but this is like the first other than

3246
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:29,330
the cadillac escalade kinda.
But this was like another level,

3247
02:28:29,630 --> 02:28:34,630
like super high tech family,
luxury sled that hauls ass.

3248
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:37,100
It's pretty dope dude.
I watched some of the videos on it and

3249
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:40,250
how they make these things and like all
the different features that they have in

3250
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:42,410
them.
Huge screens now.

3251
02:28:42,411 --> 02:28:45,140
Everything has giant screens.
Like a lot of these cars now,

3252
02:28:45,141 --> 02:28:48,650
they don't have a dashboard.
They just have a screen and you know,

3253
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:50,910
you could,
you could customize it in different.

3254
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:56,370
My mind is a fake screen screen screen.
Virtual gauges,

3255
02:28:57,951 --> 02:28:58,610
right?
Yeah.

3256
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:00,440
It comes on and says,
man,

3257
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:02,270
it's crazy.
It's weird.

3258
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:03,830
It's weird to see.
I got a video.

3259
02:29:03,831 --> 02:29:06,050
We should watch this coming up from the
google io thing.

3260
02:29:06,430 --> 02:29:09,200
It might counter contradict what we were
just says.

3261
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:11,450
No joke.
Google assistant will start making phone

3262
02:29:11,451 --> 02:29:12,130
calls to.
Yeah,

3263
02:29:12,130 --> 02:29:14,110
businesses to make appointments on your
behalf.

3264
02:29:14,350 --> 02:29:17,800
It's called google duplex.
The api call or even ads?

3265
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:20,440
Oms and ems.
Oh,

3266
02:29:20,441 --> 02:29:21,274
jesus.

3267
02:29:24,220 --> 02:29:27,880
Haircut for a client.
I'm looking for something.

3268
02:29:27,881 --> 02:29:29,350
I mean,
it's not a real voice.

3269
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:48,880
If
you have anything that

3270
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:58,240
she would like her to be looking for.
Just the woman hair cut for now.

3271
02:29:59,380 --> 02:30:01,940
We of
had a.

3272
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:03,903
Okay.
What's

3273
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:08,040
the first thing that we thought?
Okay,

3274
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:12,490
perfect.
Okay,

3275
02:30:12,491 --> 02:30:13,430
great.
Thanks.

3276
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:14,720
Have a great day.
Bye.

3277
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,420
That's awesome.
I love that.

3278
02:30:18,470 --> 02:30:20,810
Totally freaked me out.
Yeah.

3279
02:30:20,811 --> 02:30:22,330
Okay,
so now you're back.

3280
02:30:24,030 --> 02:30:24,863
That's crazy.

3281
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:29,300
I think we just learned something.
I think we're going to be having

3282
02:30:29,301 --> 02:30:31,790
conversations with those things.
It's going to be like that movie with

3283
02:30:31,791 --> 02:30:32,650
joaquin.
Yeah,

3284
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:34,580
that's her.
That's her.

3285
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:37,160
That is her
man.

3286
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:40,670
It's just a matter of time.
I don't know how much time,

3287
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:44,750
but it's definitely 20 years.
In 20 years you're going to have people

3288
02:30:44,751 --> 02:30:46,550
calling you.
You're going to have me calling you.

3289
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:48,640
I'm going to call you and say some goofy
shit.

3290
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:50,540
It's not even going to be me.
I'm going to call you up and go,

3291
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:52,220
dude,
what are you doing right now?

3292
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:54,200
Come on.
Fuck sleep.

3293
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,550
Let's go do something.
Let's get in the car.

3294
02:30:56,810 --> 02:30:59,870
Let's go drive.
Let's just go drive to joshua tree right

3295
02:30:59,871 --> 02:31:01,070
now and do mushrooms.
Fuck it.

3296
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,500
You don't have any kids.
And we'd be like,

3297
02:31:03,501 --> 02:31:05,720
okay,
I'll be by your house in 20 minutes.

3298
02:31:06,070 --> 02:31:08,990
You'd be out there waiting while I'm
home sleeping.

3299
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:11,990
Well,
it is weird when he talked to like,

3300
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:14,710
you know,
they can call up apple or something like

3301
02:31:14,711 --> 02:31:17,800
that and you had the automated assistant
and they had the fake typewriter.

3302
02:31:17,801 --> 02:31:18,600
Sounds like,
oh,

3303
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:19,450
let me back.

3304
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:24,420
It makes me mad.
It makes me may still do that.

3305
02:31:24,421 --> 02:31:25,000
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3306
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,070
I've heard that.
The.

3307
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:28,140
Oh my god,
that's so crazy.

3308
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:29,093
Limit check.

3309
02:31:30,770 --> 02:31:32,850
Right?
Why don't you just take that out and

3310
02:31:32,851 --> 02:31:35,940
just be fascinating here.
So let me hear some of that fake

3311
02:31:35,941 --> 02:31:37,320
typewriter south.

3312
02:31:40,730 --> 02:31:42,690
That's hilarious.
I forgot they do that.

3313
02:31:42,691 --> 02:31:42,880
Yeah,

3314
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:43,760
apple does that.
Oh,

3315
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:49,500
it's so clunky to sounds shitty.
I just wish apple had more options,

3316
02:31:50,860 --> 02:31:53,170
you know,
like I get that they only one to have

3317
02:31:53,171 --> 02:31:56,440
one phone and a few different versions
of it rather,

3318
02:31:56,441 --> 02:31:57,730
you know,
they have a small one.

3319
02:31:57,731 --> 02:32:00,040
If the big one,
the middle sized one

3320
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:05,120
from Canada revenue agency.
The reason why the appliances in touch

3321
02:32:05,671 --> 02:32:10,671
with you by you that
back in your text.

3322
02:32:12,310 --> 02:32:16,450
Yeah.
This is a scammer attack scammer,

3323
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:20,290
but what brian said was that when you
call apple,

3324
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:22,720
they would have a fake typewriter sound
in the background,

3325
02:32:23,890 --> 02:32:25,550
but I did get scammed by that text
scammer.

3326
02:32:25,551 --> 02:32:27,850
I think he just got scammed by.
That guy was the one I was talking about

3327
02:32:27,851 --> 02:32:28,940
earlier.
That's a lyric,

3328
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:29,980
but they didn't really yet.
Yeah,

3329
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:32,980
no,
I knew right away you got knocked off.

3330
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:34,180
I did tell my accountant.
He goes,

3331
02:32:34,181 --> 02:32:35,014
yeah,
they don't do that.

3332
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:40,380
That's what I thought.
You need to contact me with your worried

3333
02:32:40,601 --> 02:32:45,120
about right now.
Like who's who's hearing that going?

3334
02:32:45,170 --> 02:32:47,320
Look,
I got a contact.

3335
02:32:47,321 --> 02:32:49,960
You hold on.
I'm in walmart right now.

3336
02:32:49,961 --> 02:32:51,490
Let me get to my car.
Hello?

3337
02:32:51,970 --> 02:32:53,770
I'm calling you back about the tax
thing.

3338
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:58,090
Oh,
we are so lucky that you have contacted

3339
02:32:58,091 --> 02:33:01,180
me at this moment for dangers in the
air.

3340
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:04,360
Sir.
Did you fake type?

3341
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:08,120
Did you see chris delea in or with this
logan guys?

3342
02:33:08,970 --> 02:33:10,780
I only know about it because young
jamie,

3343
02:33:11,770 --> 02:33:13,540
jamie,
and for me that it might've been one of

3344
02:33:13,541 --> 02:33:18,100
the most epic battles.
So funny man.

3345
02:33:18,130 --> 02:33:22,960
He uh,
he owned them so hard to the point where

3346
02:33:22,961 --> 02:33:24,760
I thought whatever the guy's name is is
like,

3347
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:28,180
oh,
he's making fun of a kid or something

3348
02:33:28,181 --> 02:33:29,830
like that.
Like he calls himself like a younger

3349
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:31,990
guy.
He calls him an old man.

3350
02:33:32,090 --> 02:33:35,890
This old man making fun of a young
whippersnappers.

3351
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:38,170
Young people always like to point that
out.

3352
02:33:38,230 --> 02:33:39,220
That you're older.
Yeah,

3353
02:33:39,221 --> 02:33:42,640
they think it's hilarious because
they're so terrified of getting old.

3354
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:45,000
Yeah.
Like everybody is so like there's this

3355
02:33:45,010 --> 02:33:47,500
thing or someone will make fun of who
you broke.

3356
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:51,110
You broke your fucking 36 years old.
Like

3357
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:55,960
what does it mean?
It's almost over bro.

3358
02:33:56,410 --> 02:33:59,290
Six hundred and 59,000 likes.
He said,

3359
02:33:59,291 --> 02:34:03,850
at least when my career dies,
you can film it and put it on youtube

3360
02:34:03,910 --> 02:34:06,730
meme that suicide for.
Why does Logan Paul?

3361
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:09,130
He's responding to his.
Oh,

3362
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:12,850
I'm laughing.
Cause now I know why your comedy career

3363
02:34:12,851 --> 02:34:15,940
took a dive.
Oh jesus.

3364
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,160
He get owned.
And so then chris

3365
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,480
says to him that,
yeah,

3366
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:21,270
at least with my career dies,
you can film it,

3367
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:26,290
put it on youtube.
That is 658,000 likes more than trump in

3368
02:34:27,671 --> 02:34:29,050
any,
any tweet trump's ever had.

3369
02:34:30,980 --> 02:34:32,980
And leah,
you need to run for president.

3370
02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:36,850
Uh,

3371
02:34:36,851 --> 02:34:37,684

that's like the strongest response I've

3373
02:34:40,961 --> 02:34:44,600
ever seen because this is logan in
response to that say,

3374
02:34:44,601 --> 02:34:47,110
but knock it a lie.
This single tweet is funny.

3375
02:34:47,111 --> 02:34:49,540
Then your entire netflix special.
Thanks.

3376
02:34:49,660 --> 02:34:52,510
How's it feel to have your name finally
attached to something funny?

3377
02:34:55,340 --> 02:34:57,730
Oh,
oh,

3378
02:34:58,570 --> 02:34:59,070
oh,

3379
02:34:59,070 --> 02:35:00,750
oh my god.
Amazing.

3380
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:03,010
God,
I don't know what's worse,

3381
02:35:03,011 --> 02:35:07,750
being the shun vlogger or being the 38
year old comedian arguing with the

3382
02:35:07,751 --> 02:35:09,610
shunt,
vulgar on twitter.

3383
02:35:10,210 --> 02:35:13,480
Ask your fans to have their moms read
this out loud to them.

3384
02:35:13,690 --> 02:35:14,523
See what they.

3385
02:35:19,430 --> 02:35:20,263
God,
that's good.

3386
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:23,130
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

3387
02:35:23,131 --> 02:35:27,480
He's the wrong guy to fuck with he.
He'll do this all day old people

3388
02:35:27,481 --> 02:35:29,640
roasting me.
Greatest thing on planet earth.

3389
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:32,740
How about this?
You're my son.

3390
02:35:32,770 --> 02:35:34,000
Tag your fucking daddy.

3391
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:35,250
I'm fucking dead.

3392
02:35:38,150 --> 02:35:39,390
Well,
what's the thing that he deleted?

3393
02:35:40,410 --> 02:35:41,560
Oh,
that's hilarious.

3394
02:35:42,310 --> 02:35:43,810
Damn powerful.
Kristalina.

3395
02:35:43,930 --> 02:35:45,400
Fucking love it.
Hard in the paint

3396
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:49,671
crystal.
Funny dude.

3397
02:35:49,671 --> 02:35:51,950
Man data.
His instagram stories or some of my

3398
02:35:51,951 --> 02:35:54,380
favorites.
Anything chris does is pretty fucking

3399
02:35:54,381 --> 02:35:58,670
funny.
So far you've called me daddy and

3400
02:35:58,671 --> 02:36:01,430
admitted to watching my entire comedy
special.

3401
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:03,470
Are you trying to burn me or fuck me.

3402
02:36:06,990 --> 02:36:08,270
Okay.
That's all right.

3403
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:11,660
I get it.
Just delirious.

3404
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:14,390
I don't know why you would try to fight
a professional comedian on twitter.

3405
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:17,660
He's a comedian.
A guy like chris who loves that kind of

3406
02:36:17,661 --> 02:36:19,820
shit.
He loves that kind of stuff.

3407
02:36:20,330 --> 02:36:21,170
Who doesn't?
That's.

3408
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:23,900
Yeah,
he's like an artist,

3409
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:28,040
but that kind of stuff like perfectly
like not aggressive.

3410
02:36:28,220 --> 02:36:31,970
You know everything about it.
It's like it was very smooth.

3411
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:33,730
It was very good.
Here.

3412
02:36:33,750 --> 02:36:35,700
It's like the old days,
you know,

3413
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:39,200
putting people on the.
That was a very good one.

3414
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:41,180
You know,
people are so weird.

3415
02:36:42,530 --> 02:36:43,363
They really are.

3416
02:36:44,330 --> 02:36:46,490
I'm just wondering what's going to be
the next thing that people,

3417
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:51,880
you know,
like instagram seems to be like a that's

3418
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:52,940
a,
a platform.

3419
02:36:52,941 --> 02:36:55,220
People like they like pictures and text
behind the pictures,

3420
02:36:55,221 --> 02:36:56,540
but like what is going to be the next
thing?

3421
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:58,970
Is it going to be some sort of augmented
thing,

3422
02:36:59,210 --> 02:37:03,650
some virtual thing or some goggles thing
or it's got to be something that's going

3423
02:37:03,651 --> 02:37:07,190
to be something in another space other
than just your phone.

3424
02:37:08,330 --> 02:37:12,170
I really think that there's gonna come a
time where the same amount of time that

3425
02:37:12,171 --> 02:37:15,140
people spend on social media,
they're going to spend some sort an

3426
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:18,470
augmented state,
like you'll be able to wear these things

3427
02:37:18,471 --> 02:37:21,800
for work because they help you pull
things up so people just accept.

3428
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:24,470
I have to have my goggles.
Like everybody wears goggles at a

3429
02:37:24,471 --> 02:37:26,270
certain point in time because it's just
so much cooler.

3430
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:29,480
It adjusts for vision,
gives you perfect vision.

3431
02:37:29,890 --> 02:37:31,600
That black mirror episode about the
human,

3432
02:37:31,630 --> 02:37:34,210
the dvr when everyone can record,
but yes,

3433
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:36,190
that's.
I mean so many other black mirror things

3434
02:37:36,191 --> 02:37:40,300
have sort of been coming true.
That seems like the most realistic one

3435
02:37:40,301 --> 02:37:41,290
that might happen.
I think.

3436
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:43,070
Recording memories.
Yeah,

3437
02:37:43,071 --> 02:37:44,060
probably someday.

3438
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:46,290
I think they're close.
I saw an article recently.

3439
02:37:46,291 --> 02:37:51,210
They're close to being able to either
record your dreams and play them back

3440
02:37:51,211 --> 02:37:54,090
for you or reinterpret them after you're
awake,

3441
02:37:54,091 --> 02:37:57,810
but I think it's record them as you're
sleeping and kind of find out what you

3442
02:37:57,811 --> 02:37:59,370
were.
Maybe rewatch it or something.

3443
02:37:59,430 --> 02:38:02,550
I hope not.
What if the shits in high def if like

3444
02:38:02,750 --> 02:38:03,583
falling

3445
02:38:03,730 --> 02:38:08,140
buildings in high def
demons or barking at you?

3446
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:11,233
No,
I.

3447
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:13,880
I had.
Do you ever out of nowhere just have a

3448
02:38:13,881 --> 02:38:16,520
dream.
You're like embarrassed that you even

3449
02:38:16,521 --> 02:38:19,550
thought that even though you had no
control of it.

3450
02:38:19,850 --> 02:38:22,920
A lot of them theoretically recording
dreams is possible.

3451
02:38:22,950 --> 02:38:27,310
Scientists are trying to cover magazine
march.

3452
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:30,840
Of course it is.
They just got to figure out how to get

3453
02:38:30,841 --> 02:38:34,710
into the door with eventually if people
survive,

3454
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:39,900
they're going to have with every
generation a greater greater

3455
02:38:39,901 --> 02:38:42,240
understanding of how to manipulate
things around them.

3456
02:38:42,570 --> 02:38:47,040
It's just what people strive for.
Strive for manipulating the environment,

3457
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:52,190
manipulating electrical currents,
manipulating concrete,

3458
02:38:52,951 --> 02:38:56,160
moving things around,
shaping things that we just keep getting

3459
02:38:56,161 --> 02:38:57,870
better and better and better at it.
Of course,

3460
02:38:57,871 --> 02:39:02,800
we're going to keep getting better and
better at it technologically to can I

3461
02:39:02,801 --> 02:39:04,440
have some crazy shit,
man,

3462
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:09,420
and we're going to wonder why we did it.
We're going to all be stuck.

3463
02:39:10,220 --> 02:39:15,030
Some strange,
weird matrix like environment we're

3464
02:39:15,031 --> 02:39:17,490
already are.
It seems like it easily could be

3465
02:39:17,491 --> 02:39:20,040
happening.
Not necessarily like right now,

3466
02:39:20,041 --> 02:39:23,190
but on the way to that,
like what's the logical conclusion?

3467
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:27,240
I mean is does anybody believe that
people at this point are going to back

3468
02:39:27,241 --> 02:39:28,590
up?
That they're going to go,

3469
02:39:28,591 --> 02:39:30,130
hey,
you know what?

3470
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:32,250
This technology is just getting too much
into our lives.

3471
02:39:32,310 --> 02:39:35,070
We went to a restaurant last night.
Dad was on his phone.

3472
02:39:35,790 --> 02:39:38,730
This kid's got a 12 inch ipad propped up
in front of them.

3473
02:39:39,030 --> 02:39:42,420
The other kid on the other side of the
table has a 12 inch ipad propped up in

3474
02:39:42,421 --> 02:39:46,860
front of him and they're just watching
three different things and no one's

3475
02:39:46,861 --> 02:39:49,560
talking to each other and they're there
at a sushi joint.

3476
02:39:49,650 --> 02:39:50,850
Wow.
And you're like,

3477
02:39:50,851 --> 02:39:52,770
wow,
this is what people do.

3478
02:39:53,430 --> 02:39:56,610
They get together,
they put a show on in front of the kid,

3479
02:39:56,611 --> 02:39:57,444
hey,
go.

3480
02:39:57,540 --> 02:40:02,220
And they just the entire time,
not even like the parents are done,

3481
02:40:02,221 --> 02:40:03,890
they want to talk and can I use your
phone,

3482
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:04,320
your head?

3483
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:05,670
Go ahead and use my phone and play a
game.

3484
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:07,830
The kids playing in the game,
somebody talking to somebody?

3485
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:10,050
No,
nobody's talking to anybody.

3486
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:12,660
Everybody's looking at it.
An electronic device.

3487
02:40:12,690 --> 02:40:16,020
You go to public place and they sit down
and then not interacting with each

3488
02:40:16,021 --> 02:40:17,730
other.
It is super normal,

3489
02:40:17,731 --> 02:40:19,200
man.
If you look around,

3490
02:40:19,201 --> 02:40:21,380
it's super normal,
super normal,

3491
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:24,210
weird.
We're going to wonder about that in a

3492
02:40:24,210 --> 02:40:26,430
few years.
We're going to wonder like how do they

3493
02:40:26,431 --> 02:40:28,290
let that in?
How do they lead this?

3494
02:40:28,291 --> 02:40:30,030
Like I was watching these little kids.
I was like,

3495
02:40:30,210 --> 02:40:31,920
okay,
I don't want to be a judge parent,

3496
02:40:33,630 --> 02:40:35,700
but just I'm just looking at it like a
human.

3497
02:40:36,150 --> 02:40:40,740
How much less time are they spending
talking to people now,

3498
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:44,700
how many less awkward moments at the
dinner table we had a workout.

3499
02:40:44,701 --> 02:40:49,701
Just controlling your temper or
controlling your emotions are

3500
02:40:50,041 --> 02:40:53,250
controlling the way you interact with
people or trying to be nicer about some

3501
02:40:53,251 --> 02:40:55,370
of the ways you say things and learning
to get that.

3502
02:40:55,510 --> 02:40:58,320
The only way people learn about that
stuff is at a dinner table,

3503
02:40:58,350 --> 02:40:59,700
right?
Talk to each other.

3504
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:03,150
That's part of like how people learn to
communicate with each other,

3505
02:41:03,151 --> 02:41:04,620
sitting down at dinner.
Right.

3506
02:41:05,190 --> 02:41:07,440
All of a sudden everyone's like watching
a screen.

3507
02:41:08,250 --> 02:41:10,140
How much less time are we spending
talking

3508
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:16,640
like how much shittier are people going
to be if they continue doing that at

3509
02:41:16,990 --> 02:41:19,980
talking to real people and is that an
issue?

3510
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:26,450
I think it is.
I think people don't have as strong as

3511
02:41:26,451 --> 02:41:30,010
compassion with each other,
like as much as much compassion and then

3512
02:41:30,011 --> 02:41:33,110
mike value human life.
That's why there's more school shooters

3513
02:41:33,111 --> 02:41:36,200
and and you know,
the realness of it.

3514
02:41:36,201 --> 02:41:38,930
It's kind of getting faded,
you know,

3515
02:41:38,931 --> 02:41:43,931
death is way more in your eyes nowadays
as a kid than it was when we were young.

3516
02:41:44,301 --> 02:41:45,500
We were just,
you know,

3517
02:41:45,750 --> 02:41:48,710
you know,
playing with frogs and playing cops and

3518
02:41:48,711 --> 02:41:51,080
robbers.
We didn't have internet to see death.

3519
02:41:51,081 --> 02:41:54,380
We didn't have.
Tv wasn't about death at the time.

3520
02:41:54,680 --> 02:41:55,690
You know,
a video.

3521
02:41:55,790 --> 02:42:00,200
Video games is all death.
I mean you have lives in video games

3522
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:01,163
when,
when was the,

3523
02:42:01,250 --> 02:42:03,830
you have lives when you're a kid,
you know,

3524
02:42:03,870 --> 02:42:06,110
the cats had that.
That's a good point,

3525
02:42:06,111 --> 02:42:06,450
man.

3526
02:42:06,450 --> 02:42:09,210
I mean especially how much you could see
on the internet,

3527
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:12,750
the,
the amount of horrible shit that people

3528
02:42:12,751 --> 02:42:15,540
see on a daily basis on the internet.
Like people will tell me,

3529
02:42:15,541 --> 02:42:16,440
hey,
you want to see this video?

3530
02:42:16,441 --> 02:42:17,274
I'm like,
no,

3531
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:20,040
I've seen enough.
I know what people are capable of.

3532
02:42:20,041 --> 02:42:20,874
I'm good.

3533
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:24,510
Some people not though.
Some people all day watching fucked up

3534
02:42:24,511 --> 02:42:25,260
shit,
don't,

3535
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:26,093
don't,
don't,

3536
02:42:26,170 --> 02:42:29,400
don't start with cable though.
Do you remember how it started with

3537
02:42:29,401 --> 02:42:31,620
cable and when we were an older.
I wasn't old enough but

3538
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:34,230
sorta,
but it really started with videotape.

3539
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:37,300
Okay.
Like faces of death and shit like that.

3540
02:42:37,301 --> 02:42:40,510
You started seeing the face of death.
I remember the video a friend of mine

3541
02:42:40,511 --> 02:42:44,410
sent me was a girl walking towards the
train.

3542
02:42:44,411 --> 02:42:48,520
She's not paying attention and she gets
nailed by the train and it's fucking

3543
02:42:48,521 --> 02:42:51,160
horrific man.
She just gets torn apart.

3544
02:42:51,161 --> 02:42:53,320
You watch and you're like,
oh my god.

3545
02:42:53,740 --> 02:42:55,300
Oh my god.
It's hard to watch.

3546
02:42:55,450 --> 02:42:57,430
I used to always talk about this,
but what was,

3547
02:42:57,431 --> 02:43:00,220
it was definitely faces of death and it
was definitely ufc one,

3548
02:43:00,221 --> 02:43:01,360
two and three,
you know,

3549
02:43:01,361 --> 02:43:06,060
like the early days of ufc seeing mixed
matched like people go at it and just

3550
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:09,640
the brutal kaos you know,
and there was no rules back then.

3551
02:43:09,641 --> 02:43:12,030
It was just like death.
You're.

3552
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:15,250
There wasn't very many rules like you
couldn't eye gouge where you could punch

3553
02:43:15,251 --> 02:43:16,150
in the nuts.
Right.

3554
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:19,480
And you never saw that before it was
boxing on tv.

3555
02:43:19,481 --> 02:43:20,710
It was never like,
oh my god,

3556
02:43:20,711 --> 02:43:25,711
these guys are fighting like dirty,
dirty fighting and pulling hair and not

3557
02:43:26,951 --> 02:43:28,260
punching shit.
Yeah.

3558
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:32,110
Yeah.
I think that's probably true too.

3559
02:43:32,111 --> 02:43:34,570
I think our appetite for stimulation is
increasing.

3560
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:38,110
That's what I think for real.
I think that's why people like so many

3561
02:43:38,111 --> 02:43:40,540
thrilling things.
I think we're developing a stronger and

3562
02:43:40,541 --> 02:43:44,080
stronger appetite for stimulation.
That's what I think it is,

3563
02:43:44,081 --> 02:43:46,960
dude.
And and I think the internet and you

3564
02:43:46,961 --> 02:43:48,220
know,
just so many different things you could

3565
02:43:48,221 --> 02:43:51,040
see like how,
how was it the weekend like

3566
02:43:51,041 --> 02:43:55,450
instantaneously pull up video of a
volcano eating a car.

3567
02:43:56,260 --> 02:43:57,280
I mean,
what,

3568
02:43:57,910 --> 02:43:59,290
how many people are supposed to see
that?

3569
02:43:59,590 --> 02:44:01,660
Like,
you're not supposed to see that shit all

3570
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:05,200
day from all over the world.
You're not supposed to see all these

3571
02:44:05,201 --> 02:44:09,130
different volcano eruptions and
different shootings and cars running

3572
02:44:09,131 --> 02:44:11,590
over people in times square and all that
crazy shit.

3573
02:44:11,650 --> 02:44:14,250
If he lived in Kansas,
a lava shouldn't really be.

3574
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:15,840
Yeah,
it should be on your list of shit.

3575
02:44:15,880 --> 02:44:18,130
You got a small amount of things to
think about in front of you.

3576
02:44:18,860 --> 02:44:20,980
You could live forever at each
direction.

3577
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:23,890
Everything's flat.
You shouldn't be worried about lava

3578
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:27,760
should you wish you should have some
fucking lava to mix things up.

3579
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:32,620
That's gotta be a weird place to be,
man.

3580
02:44:32,621 --> 02:44:35,950
When you're watching that earth crack
open and you realize how thin the crust

3581
02:44:35,951 --> 02:44:38,800
is between you and the most insane shit
ever.

3582
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:44,400
Rivers of hot molten rock,
right under the surface of the ground.

3583
02:44:47,021 --> 02:44:48,790
You're walking on like,
what?

3584
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:52,390
How much is down there?
Why did we camp out here?

3585
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:55,780
I get paranoid.
It's still at earthquakes.

3586
02:44:55,781 --> 02:44:57,910
I was in the belly room at the comedy
store the other day,

3587
02:44:57,911 --> 02:44:59,170
packed.
Right?

3588
02:44:59,610 --> 02:45:01,330
And if it was just like the big
earthquake,

3589
02:45:01,331 --> 02:45:03,280
then we would all be dead.
It was too many people.

3590
02:45:03,281 --> 02:45:05,860
There would be no escape this one place
because you know what I mean?

3591
02:45:05,861 --> 02:45:07,180
But I got that in my head.
I'm like,

3592
02:45:07,210 --> 02:45:08,290
alright,
I gotta get outta here.

3593
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:12,760
So terrible thing to think of a building
and it starts collapsing or any parking

3594
02:45:12,770 --> 02:45:14,350
garage,
living here in la,

3595
02:45:14,351 --> 02:45:16,650
we go to this whole parking garages
downtown here,

3596
02:45:16,660 --> 02:45:17,500
like,
oh yeah,

3597
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:18,730
I'm going to be a sandwich.

3598
02:45:18,730 --> 02:45:20,350
Something.
Yeah man,

3599
02:45:20,351 --> 02:45:22,780
I,
I came to la right after the first

3600
02:45:22,781 --> 02:45:24,180
earthquake.
Uh,

3601
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:26,440
first one,
obviously the big one,

3602
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:28,390
the last big one.
Um,

3603
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:31,120
and then there was some small ones after
that.

3604
02:45:32,290 --> 02:45:36,310
There was a,
I think that one of the biggest ones was

3605
02:45:36,311 --> 02:45:38,740
san francisco.
I think san francisco was during the

3606
02:45:38,741 --> 02:45:40,960
world series.
It was a really big one.

3607
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:43,060
Right.
How big was that one?

3608
02:45:43,150 --> 02:45:46,360
I think.
Was it going on during a game?

3609
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:49,630
Yeah,
in the middle of the game world started

3610
02:45:49,631 --> 02:45:51,730
to end.
That'd be cool footage.

3611
02:45:51,731 --> 02:45:54,970
San francisco gets a lot of them.
There was a six point nine is the same

3612
02:45:54,971 --> 02:45:56,560
as the one on why.
Wow.

3613
02:45:58,030 --> 02:46:00,050
What's the coincidence of that?
Huh?

3614
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:02,950
Wow.
That's some powerful shit.

3615
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:05,380
And
just the.

3616
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:08,400
To me
it's a.

3617
02:46:10,670 --> 02:46:12,560
It's a thing that we all know to be
true,

3618
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:15,380
but you don't think about it until it
happens.

3619
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:19,730
We all know that the earth's mantle
shifts and moves.

3620
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:21,440
We know that,
that it happens.

3621
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:24,380
We know that earthquakes happen.
We know the volcanoes happen,

3622
02:46:24,381 --> 02:46:26,960
but even so it's still

3623
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:35,520
the hesitation allowing jose conseco to
score and he goes to get dave parker.

3624
02:46:37,361 --> 02:46:39,440
So when is the earthquake here?
Second phase.

3625
02:46:39,450 --> 02:46:40,720
So the oakland a's.

3626
02:46:48,190 --> 02:46:49,540
It's like a scene in a movie.

3627
02:46:49,620 --> 02:46:52,950
What the fuck?
Holy shit.

3628
02:46:56,100 --> 02:46:56,933
Wow.

3629
02:46:58,510 --> 02:47:00,100
That's just one of those things.
You know,

3630
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:03,050
we think of it like,
yeah,

3631
02:47:03,051 --> 02:47:04,760
yeah,
the earthquakes are real,

3632
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:08,090
but until it actually happens at scary,
it was kind of scary.

3633
02:47:08,150 --> 02:47:10,010
You felt a good one,
right?

3634
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:14,390
You felt a little bit of a tremor.
It seems like it used to be way more

3635
02:47:14,391 --> 02:47:18,380
when I first moved here.
Like I almost feel one like once a month

3636
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:20,930
for awhile.
I haven't felt one in a long time.

3637
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:25,380
It's on tape right here.
What is red bands feeling?

3638
02:47:25,390 --> 02:47:26,001
The earth.
Oh yeah.

3639
02:47:26,001 --> 02:47:27,410
This is when I was.
I felt

3640
02:47:27,640 --> 02:47:31,180
this is probably the biggest one.
I remember really.

3641
02:47:32,110 --> 02:47:37,110
Death squad studio
isn't frozen.

3642
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:43,330
This happened to me before we to.
There it goes.

3643
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:48,840
I started thinking about our insurance
covers this

3644
02:47:51,460 --> 02:47:52,293
frozen.

3645
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:56,590
Is it youtube is fault on my computer.
Oh,

3646
02:47:56,591 --> 02:47:57,520
is that?
Oh,

3647
02:47:57,521 --> 02:47:58,700
is it the machine?
Yeah.

3648
02:47:58,830 --> 02:48:02,040
Tri caster think.
Oh yeah,

3649
02:48:02,130 --> 02:48:04,740
that,
that freaked me out because we had the

3650
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:07,810
studio at the ice house and I kept on
thinking about the ceiling.

3651
02:48:07,811 --> 02:48:10,300
Just cave in because that's like an old
building.

3652
02:48:10,690 --> 02:48:13,270
Yeah.
And I freaked the fuck out,

3653
02:48:13,271 --> 02:48:15,790
but that was scary.
I think they did something to make it

3654
02:48:15,791 --> 02:48:18,810
earthquake compliant though.
Do you know if I'm.

3655
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:20,330
I hope I'm right about this.
You're right.

3656
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:22,780
Do you know how you walked through the
courtyard area?

3657
02:48:23,470 --> 02:48:24,380
Yeah,
yeah.

3658
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:28,180
They put all that stuff apparently to
reinforce it from earthquakes.

3659
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:31,090
Yeah,
I mean that the walls or something it

3660
02:48:31,091 --> 02:48:36,091
might fix but not the ceiling fucking
fall right through it links.

3661
02:48:36,191 --> 02:48:39,280
It's already have that building's phone.
Like what?

3662
02:48:39,340 --> 02:48:43,660
Nineteen 50 something I probably said
earlier than that.

3663
02:48:43,661 --> 02:48:45,890
I mean I think crazy old,
right?

3664
02:48:45,970 --> 02:48:48,100
Like it's.
I think it's been an operation as a

3665
02:48:48,101 --> 02:48:52,050
nightclub since the sixties.
I think it started out as an actual ice

3666
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:54,280
house,
like way earlier than that opened in

3667
02:48:54,281 --> 02:48:56,710
1960,
1969.

3668
02:48:56,770 --> 02:48:59,890
It opened the ice house.
What was it before in that building?

3669
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:03,040
I'm pretty sure in that building and it
wasn't actual ice house,

3670
02:49:03,041 --> 02:49:04,980
which is why they decided to call it the
ice house.

3671
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:07,030
You know,
sean's doesn't work there.

3672
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:08,170
Yeah,
I know.

3673
02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:09,810
It sucks.
Twenty years.

3674
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:11,070
He's an awesome guy.

3675
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:14,420
Place is so sweet.
Well,

3676
02:49:14,490 --> 02:49:15,323
where do you go?

3677
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:16,260
Uh,
I'm not sure.

3678
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:17,550
I haven't talked to him about it on the
air.

3679
02:49:18,310 --> 02:49:20,910
Go tom.
You said besides therapist now.

3680
02:49:21,130 --> 02:49:24,860
Hey,
he does it better than anybody at first.

3681
02:49:24,880 --> 02:49:29,160
Feels weird because you know,
the air blows it in there.

3682
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:30,250
Oh,
I don't think that's,

3683
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:35,640
that's not fda approved.
Could you imagine if this was,

3684
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:41,480
is that a rub maps still a thing when
backpage still funny.

3685
02:49:42,551 --> 02:49:44,340
I know this went backpage,
uh,

3686
02:49:44,370 --> 02:49:47,820
went down a rub.
Maps kind of freaked out for like a week

3687
02:49:47,910 --> 02:49:48,691
and said like,
hey,

3688
02:49:48,691 --> 02:49:49,480
you know,
we're not,

3689
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:50,880
we're,
we're not open right now.

3690
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:52,140
Nothing's working.
Uh,

3691
02:49:52,270 --> 02:49:54,420
you won't be charged this month.
Uh,

3692
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:57,210
and uh,
but then like a couple of weeks later

3693
02:49:57,211 --> 02:50:00,270
that it's back in,
it was always working to like,

3694
02:50:00,271 --> 02:50:02,160
it just had this weird notice before it.

3695
02:50:02,850 --> 02:50:04,920
Well,
I wonder how people feel,

3696
02:50:05,310 --> 02:50:06,660
you know,
that are in that business,

3697
02:50:08,670 --> 02:50:11,880
those backpage companies and all those,
those companies that are,

3698
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:12,810
you know,
those,

3699
02:50:13,290 --> 02:50:14,123
those,
uh,

3700
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:16,410
some that's like the classifieds,
right?

3701
02:50:16,460 --> 02:50:17,010
Right.
Like,

3702
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:19,270
so they have to pay to be in the
classifieds that don't work.

3703
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:21,660
So they lose all that business,
all of it.

3704
02:50:21,750 --> 02:50:23,700
It's like a nonverbal business anymore.

3705
02:50:23,850 --> 02:50:26,700
Well,
roadmaps was good because it was like

3706
02:50:26,701 --> 02:50:30,990
yelp for a massage parlor and and so you
if you wanted to go.

3707
02:50:31,350 --> 02:50:33,840
I use it for the opposite reason.
Now we're like,

3708
02:50:33,841 --> 02:50:36,360
the other day I wanted a real massage
and I checked to make sure that that

3709
02:50:36,361 --> 02:50:39,020
wasn't a rub and tug place.
Right.

3710
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:41,940
Because they're all rubbing to have
places here in los angeles.

3711
02:50:41,941 --> 02:50:45,210
Like it's hard to find one that's not
now and sometimes you just don't want

3712
02:50:45,211 --> 02:50:46,440
that.
You want a real massage.

3713
02:50:47,010 --> 02:50:50,040
I guess what I said doesn't make sense
though because it's illegal activity.

3714
02:50:50,430 --> 02:50:53,610
So as long as it's illegal activity,
of course they have to take it down.

3715
02:50:53,730 --> 02:50:55,070
No,
I don't think.

3716
02:50:55,110 --> 02:50:56,530
Not really.
What do they say?

3717
02:50:56,531 --> 02:50:59,250
Freedom of speech and shit.
Like,

3718
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:00,780
like you're allowed to talk about
cocaine,

3719
02:51:00,781 --> 02:51:03,150
you're not going to get your website
taken down.

3720
02:51:03,151 --> 02:51:04,050
And that's crazy.
Like

3721
02:51:04,650 --> 02:51:07,200
not even what I mean.
I mean I don't,

3722
02:51:07,270 --> 02:51:12,270
I don't think that.
I feel like if you're a person who is

3723
02:51:12,541 --> 02:51:15,240
making this decision and like 2018 you
saying,

3724
02:51:15,241 --> 02:51:17,340
you know what,
we've got to crack down on prostitution.

3725
02:51:17,370 --> 02:51:20,190
We got to figure out a way to.
We got to figure out a way to put a stop

3726
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:22,950
to this.
Like,

3727
02:51:23,430 --> 02:51:27,060
what are you wasting your time doing
that for a don't we have other really

3728
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:30,360
big issues that we have a hard time
finding enough people to tackle.

3729
02:51:30,430 --> 02:51:33,780
The biggest problem is sex trafficking.
That's the real reason.

3730
02:51:33,900 --> 02:51:35,080
Like there's too much traffic.

3731
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:36,320
Yeah,
that.

3732
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:37,213
That's a big one.

3733
02:51:37,650 --> 02:51:40,470
I'm
just.

3734
02:51:41,470 --> 02:51:43,350
When everything's unregulated,
right?

3735
02:51:43,810 --> 02:51:47,140
Anything that's unregulated,
you're always going to find someone who

3736
02:51:47,141 --> 02:51:50,950
fills that gap was a criminal.
Anything that's illegal that people

3737
02:51:50,951 --> 02:51:53,100
want,
whether it's drugs,

3738
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:56,140
anything.
It's really hard to tell people what

3739
02:51:56,141 --> 02:51:58,120
they can and can't do.
It's really hard.

3740
02:51:58,940 --> 02:52:01,450
It doesn't seem to make any sense.
You shouldn't be able to.

3741
02:52:01,451 --> 02:52:03,340
As long as no one's getting hurt,
you know?

3742
02:52:03,341 --> 02:52:04,900
Like what if someone decides,
hey man,

3743
02:52:04,901 --> 02:52:06,370
we at this furry thing

3744
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:10,030
and you guys are just too weird.
You can't do this anymore.

3745
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:14,350
You can't just dress up like mascots and
have sex with each other and eat a dog.

3746
02:52:14,351 --> 02:52:17,310
Food bowls can't do that anymore.
That's neat.

3747
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:20,500
These people ever.
They're having a party as furries.

3748
02:52:20,680 --> 02:52:22,060
What if someone came,
comes along and says,

3749
02:52:22,061 --> 02:52:23,800
you can't do that anymore.
It's too weird.

3750
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:27,610
Have reacted fine.
I mean,

3751
02:52:29,050 --> 02:52:32,800
I just think it's weird where people
just can decide what other people can

3752
02:52:32,801 --> 02:52:37,801
and can't do.
Especially when it comes to something as

3753
02:52:38,191 --> 02:52:43,191
ridiculous as sex
touching is that thing that makes no

3754
02:52:44,231 --> 02:52:47,050
sense.
Like hand jobs should not be illegal.

3755
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:50,020
No.
Like you're allowed to touch my arm but

3756
02:52:50,021 --> 02:52:52,720
you can't touch my dick.
It's going to be real weird.

3757
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:58,020
When robots are fuckable like really
weird when they're really fuckable like

3758
02:52:58,511 --> 02:52:59,344
they're hot.

3759
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:02,200
You know the hot.
It feels good.

3760
02:53:03,620 --> 02:53:05,770
What if someone raped that robot?
Is it going to have rights?

3761
02:53:05,950 --> 02:53:07,840
Jesus christ going to kill you,
bro.

3762
02:53:08,050 --> 02:53:11,650
They don't need to sleep.
That chick's gonna wait until your sleep

3763
02:53:11,651 --> 02:53:14,200
and then she's going to fucking elbow
your eye sockets right through.

3764
02:53:14,650 --> 02:53:17,500
Like I got arrested for like fucking a
car recently or something like that.

3765
02:53:17,501 --> 02:53:18,490
Yeah,
I didn't hear about that.

3766
02:53:19,870 --> 02:53:24,870
I think it's a matter of time before
they develop an ai in a physical body

3767
02:53:25,511 --> 02:53:30,100
that's so closely resembles a human body
that you could turn the lights down,

3768
02:53:30,310 --> 02:53:31,780
light a candle,
those new ones,

3769
02:53:31,830 --> 02:53:34,030
like the hottest girl in the world.
You've seen the new ones,

3770
02:53:34,031 --> 02:53:35,800
right?
The new sexual sex robots,

3771
02:53:35,801 --> 02:53:37,810
the ones I think they're making,
they make them in san diego.

3772
02:53:37,811 --> 02:53:39,510
I think it's the same guy that made the
real dog,

3773
02:53:39,960 --> 02:53:42,590
but that he has that new ai and the new
bodies.

3774
02:53:42,790 --> 02:53:44,770
It's it.
You can order it now.

3775
02:53:44,771 --> 02:53:49,771
I think a preorder it now it's a,
they had a video of it and then the ai

3776
02:53:50,050 --> 02:53:53,830
is pretty legit and it's not bad.
Uh,

3777
02:53:53,831 --> 02:53:55,370
it talks to you.
It remembers you.

3778
02:53:55,371 --> 02:53:57,760
You can pick the face,
you can design what you want it to look

3779
02:53:57,761 --> 02:53:59,680
like.
A dude.

3780
02:53:59,681 --> 02:54:02,620
It's a matter of time.
I know as a matter of time,

3781
02:54:02,650 --> 02:54:05,020
I know a comedian,
you know fleshlight you remember

3782
02:54:05,021 --> 02:54:06,610
flashlight.
They,

3783
02:54:06,611 --> 02:54:09,520
I guess they make these motorized
flashlights now.

3784
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:13,990
Like we kinda just strokes you.
Why you fucking so my friend a comedian,

3785
02:54:13,991 --> 02:54:15,100
we know.
I won't say who it is,

3786
02:54:15,970 --> 02:54:20,970
but he injured his dick hole from,
went too hard and went too hard and he

3787
02:54:22,391 --> 02:54:27,370
had to go to the doctor and tell
a terrible story.

3788
02:54:28,510 --> 02:54:29,530
Jesus christ.
Dude,

3789
02:54:31,030 --> 02:54:33,070
that's terrible story.
I kind of fleshlight dealer day.

3790
02:54:33,100 --> 02:54:35,000
I haven't used one in a while.
Do you still use yours?

3791
02:54:36,050 --> 02:54:39,430
All right.
I think this podcast is basically over.

3792
02:54:40,010 --> 02:54:42,850
Brian just hit the wall.
It's a.

3793
02:54:42,930 --> 02:54:45,360
It's been a while.
We were like three hours into it.

3794
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:50,480
I don't use it anymore.
I always felt so much more shame using

3795
02:54:50,831 --> 02:54:53,920
it that I did use my hand,
but it does feel better.

3796
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:55,420
Way better.
It does.

3797
02:54:56,200 --> 02:54:57,880
That's legit.
This traveling has are nice.

3798
02:54:57,881 --> 02:55:01,030
We shoot through it so you don't even
have to like clean it up anymore.

3799
02:55:01,031 --> 02:55:03,810
You just shoot through it.
He didn't make this whole mabel and what

3800
02:55:03,811 --> 02:55:04,340
does this

3801
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:05,620
guy made?
A homemade dick soccer.

3802
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:07,640
Jesus christ.
This looks terrible.

3803
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:12,880
He's got metal and ivc pipe.
The pipe is cut at 45 degrees.

3804
02:55:13,761 --> 02:55:16,280
Flashlight,
pvc pipe the fuck out of here.

3805
02:55:16,281 --> 02:55:19,040
He's got a.
It's got like a little kid's toy train.

3806
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:20,810
It's going to shoot you right onto his
dick.

3807
02:55:21,050 --> 02:55:23,150
Let's go look at it.
Nylon nuts,

3808
02:55:23,151 --> 02:55:24,110
bolts,
washers,

3809
02:55:24,111 --> 02:55:26,020
aluminum,
plywood,

3810
02:55:26,450 --> 02:55:29,060
12 volt power supply.
One hundred and 50,000.

3811
02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:32,780
Oh my god.
Such a bad idea.

3812
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,210
He changed.
That is hilarious.

3813
02:55:38,360 --> 02:55:40,800
So it's gonna slowly bullshit.
Oh,

3814
02:55:40,820 --> 02:55:43,280
he can control the pace that it blows
them.

3815
02:55:43,430 --> 02:55:45,290
Proof of concept.
Proof of concept.

3816
02:55:45,350 --> 02:55:46,071
Yeah.
Whatever,

3817
02:55:46,071 --> 02:55:48,800
bro.
Tighten the flesh.

3818
02:55:48,801 --> 02:55:50,990
One motorized flashlight to see if what
I did.

3819
02:55:50,991 --> 02:55:52,880
That's how I got this one.
Well,

3820
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:55,220
listen to the first.
I think.

3821
02:55:55,580 --> 02:55:58,580
I think we can wrap this up safely.
I miss this.

3822
02:55:59,060 --> 02:56:00,060
These are strange days.

3823
02:56:02,670 --> 02:56:06,900
I think we learned a lot today.
I did not know that you could make a

3824
02:56:06,901 --> 02:56:11,070
fucking phone call with an artificial
intelligence thing that could say um,

3825
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:13,560
and would make appointments for you and
shit.

3826
02:56:13,561 --> 02:56:15,510
And we all learned that.
That scared the shit out of me.

3827
02:56:16,350 --> 02:56:21,350
I didn't know about these choo choo
train fake vagina attractions that these

3828
02:56:22,501 --> 02:56:26,850
kids are hacking is wacky kids.
I learned that I'm not.

3829
02:56:27,610 --> 02:56:31,350
I am very confused when it comes to the
future.

3830
02:56:31,590 --> 02:56:32,670
Very.
This stuff is.

3831
02:56:33,090 --> 02:56:38,090
I think this is all happening in front
of us and I think it's insanely crazy,

3832
02:56:38,810 --> 02:56:42,600
insanely transformative and it's
happening and we don't have a fucking

3833
02:56:42,601 --> 02:56:44,710
clue as to where it's going and there's
nothing we can do about it.

3834
02:56:44,711 --> 02:56:45,544
It's we're all like,
well,

3835
02:56:45,960 --> 02:56:50,130
it is what it is.
I think it's nuts.

3836
02:56:51,770 --> 02:56:54,810
I think we are.
We're 20 years from the fucking matrix

3837
02:56:54,811 --> 02:56:57,510
and we're seeing it happen.
We're seeing it happen right now in

3838
02:56:57,511 --> 02:56:59,400
front of us.
We're seeing a little baby steps like,

3839
02:56:59,401 --> 02:56:59,911
nah,
nah,

3840
02:56:59,911 --> 02:57:01,410
we're so far off.
Yeah.

3841
02:57:01,411 --> 02:57:03,300
I went to that whole thing the other
day.

3842
02:57:03,570 --> 02:57:05,830
It was nothing went to the conference.
Nah,

3843
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:06,750
not that impressed me.

3844
02:57:06,810 --> 02:57:09,580
Which would you rather find out that
we're about to be in it or that we've

3845
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:12,420
been in it the whole time?
Which would make you more comfortable?

3846
02:57:12,450 --> 02:57:15,030
That's a very good question.
Damn,

3847
02:57:15,031 --> 02:57:16,710
that's a good question.
What do you think?

3848
02:57:17,340 --> 02:57:19,250
I think we're already in it so

3849
02:57:22,430 --> 02:57:23,660
well.
Gun to the head,

3850
02:57:24,820 --> 02:57:26,110
which you do.
Why would she say?

3851
02:57:26,150 --> 02:57:31,150
I think the reality itself is obviously
some sort of weird thing because you're

3852
02:57:31,431 --> 02:57:34,220
looking at it,
you looking at it through your eyes,

3853
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:38,330
your eyes are determining the positions
that things are in and what they look

3854
02:57:38,331 --> 02:57:41,960
like and where things are and there's
all these things that are going on

3855
02:57:41,961 --> 02:57:45,320
around you all the time that you have no
control of and they're everywhere all

3856
02:57:45,321 --> 02:57:47,660
over the planet.
People living lives and you interface

3857
02:57:47,661 --> 02:57:50,510
with those lives.
Occasionally you just accustomed to the

3858
02:57:50,511 --> 02:57:53,090
manner in which you do it,
so it seems normal,

3859
02:57:53,270 --> 02:57:56,750
but every night you close your eyes and
you go unconscious and who knows what

3860
02:57:56,751 --> 02:58:00,110
the fuck happens to your brain and then
you wake up in the morning and you have

3861
02:58:00,111 --> 02:58:03,700
to pee and you're struggling to try to
figure out what happened yesterday and

3862
02:58:03,701 --> 02:58:06,690
then while this is happening,
your ex girlfriend's fucking your best

3863
02:58:06,691 --> 02:58:10,560
friend from high school and they got
together and can't believe jamie left.

3864
02:58:10,560 --> 02:58:13,650
I mean he said he was going to stay
forever and then next thing you know

3865
02:58:13,890 --> 02:58:17,880
like this is all these lives intersect
with each other all over the world.

3866
02:58:17,910 --> 02:58:21,650
It is kind of a hologram.
It's kind of a crazy react.

3867
02:58:22,050 --> 02:58:26,940
If the real life wasn't real,
it would be super interesting.

3868
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:29,640
You'd be like,
look at the way life works.

3869
02:58:29,641 --> 02:58:34,641
Look at the way they breathe in and
breathe out carbon dioxide and the trees

3870
02:58:34,741 --> 02:58:37,410
breathe into carbon dioxide and breathe
out air,

3871
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:41,010
but they keep chopping down the trees.
They keep chopping down the trees.

3872
02:58:41,011 --> 02:58:42,030
They don't care.
They're like,

3873
02:58:42,031 --> 02:58:44,970
who cares?
I want paper to wipe my ass with a tree.

3874
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:49,440
Just wipe their ass with trees.
Literally they grind millions of trees

3875
02:58:49,441 --> 02:58:54,060
down every year and turned into pulp so
they can make paper to wipe their ass.

3876
02:58:54,270 --> 02:58:56,400
They literally wiped her ass with
nature.

3877
02:58:57,320 --> 02:58:59,910
Why don't they just use soap and water?
No,

3878
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:01,800
no.
I want a treat.

3879
02:59:02,760 --> 02:59:06,540
I want some pulverized treated.
Wipe my ass with tissue paper,

3880
02:59:07,260 --> 02:59:09,480
tissue paper.
It's fucking trees.

3881
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:13,770
It's tissue paper really made out of
trees.

3882
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:15,550
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

3883
02:59:16,410 --> 02:59:19,030
Synthetic tissue paper that's made out
of like dolphin tears.

3884
02:59:19,910 --> 02:59:21,760
Something worse.
What are they,

3885
02:59:21,820 --> 02:59:23,820
what it's like synthetic toilet papers
that real.

3886
02:59:25,470 --> 02:59:25,981
I mean,
look,

3887
02:59:25,981 --> 02:59:28,290
they have tofu chicken,
right?

3888
02:59:29,210 --> 02:59:32,580
You don't think they have like some sort
of an organic plastic out of it?

3889
02:59:32,581 --> 02:59:37,020
I think.
Did they make toilet paper and would it

3890
02:59:37,021 --> 02:59:40,710
be too rough?
They'd be the best thing ever.

3891
02:59:40,730 --> 02:59:42,440
Free free bathroom tissue.
Hemp.

3892
02:59:43,620 --> 02:59:46,020
Someone's doing it.
So I'm putting it together.

3893
02:59:47,370 --> 02:59:50,240
Is it a startup for you?
Dude?

3894
02:59:50,410 --> 02:59:52,350
I was.
I was reading all the people that

3895
02:59:52,360 --> 02:59:57,360
invested hundreds of millions of dollars
into that scam.

3896
02:59:57,860 --> 03:00:02,850
A blood test company.
That blood test company story is crazy.

3897
03:00:03,330 --> 03:00:08,330
Toronto's there was this woman and they
were calling her like the next steve

3898
03:00:08,701 --> 03:00:12,270
jobs,
but the female steve jobs even dressed

3899
03:00:12,271 --> 03:00:14,400
like I'm short black turtlenecks.
Yeah,

3900
03:00:14,401 --> 03:00:18,570
and she,
she had become this self made person I

3901
03:00:18,571 --> 03:00:23,400
think from college started this company
and then by the time she was like 40,

3902
03:00:23,401 --> 03:00:28,401
whatever she was when they busted her,
she was worth $34,000,000,000 because

3903
03:00:29,641 --> 03:00:33,900
there's blood testing thing that she had
developed and then as time went on they

3904
03:00:33,901 --> 03:00:38,030
realized that it didn't really work and
then all these people had invested like

3905
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:40,230
betsy devos,
I think it was.

3906
03:00:40,230 --> 03:00:45,230
And warren buffet had warren buffet
invested over $100,000,000 or 25.

3907
03:00:45,660 --> 03:00:50,040
Yeah.
In this company that was bullshit.

3908
03:00:50,041 --> 03:00:52,410
So these,
they put these people's health at risk

3909
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:55,770
because they gave them these tests and
the test didn't work and they're showing

3910
03:00:55,771 --> 03:00:59,070
that they kind of knew the test didn't
work with this is how this woman dressed

3911
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:02,050
all the time.
It's um,

3912
03:01:02,350 --> 03:01:03,480
it's really interesting,
man.

3913
03:01:03,481 --> 03:01:06,940
It's so really interesting story because
when you see the amount of money that

3914
03:01:06,941 --> 03:01:09,760
people invested into it and then they're
just shit out of luck.

3915
03:01:10,300 --> 03:01:13,810
She went from being worth.
I think she was worth something crazy.

3916
03:01:13,990 --> 03:01:18,370
Like the richest woman ever are the
richest self made woman ever.

3917
03:01:18,400 --> 03:01:21,130
Something along those lines is,
I think she was worth like $34 million

3918
03:01:21,131 --> 03:01:24,100
dollars at one point.
Has a twitter.

3919
03:01:25,570 --> 03:01:27,610
Yeah.
And then she's recently been charged

3920
03:01:27,611 --> 03:01:29,590
with massive fraud.
I don't know.

3921
03:01:29,830 --> 03:01:32,830
I mean I don't know shit about that
business.

3922
03:01:32,980 --> 03:01:36,820
So I don't know if the blood tests did
or didn't work or if she's got a store

3923
03:01:36,821 --> 03:01:39,180
that needs to be told.
And I don't know,

3924
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:39,870
it was just,
it.

3925
03:01:39,870 --> 03:01:42,670
Just read what you read and what you
read is that they,

3926
03:01:42,760 --> 03:01:47,350
they've fibbed about results and they
did some shit they shouldn't have done

3927
03:01:47,351 --> 03:01:49,930
and all these people got tests and they
thought they were,

3928
03:01:50,620 --> 03:01:51,760
you know,
if you get a blood test,

3929
03:01:51,761 --> 03:01:54,400
you think you're getting the accurate
results from a reputable company.

3930
03:01:54,401 --> 03:01:56,440
And it wasn't that,
it was a micro click,

3931
03:01:56,441 --> 03:02:00,160
like they would take like a micro prick
of blood and they would take that blood

3932
03:02:00,161 --> 03:02:03,430
and they would measure it and that's how
they would find whether you had diseases

3933
03:02:03,431 --> 03:02:03,840
or not.

3934
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:04,910
Yeah,
I use that one.

3935
03:02:04,911 --> 03:02:08,130
All self made woman worth four and a
half billion.

3936
03:02:08,170 --> 03:02:09,700
Okay.
So why don't I save 34?

3937
03:02:09,810 --> 03:02:12,910
So that's not even real.
It has that much like three guys,

3938
03:02:13,140 --> 03:02:14,650
a couple other people.
Okay.

3939
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:17,860
So she's worth 4 billion.
That's still nothing to sneeze at.

3940
03:02:17,900 --> 03:02:21,430
It's like a two bedroom apartment
remembered for I see a four.

3941
03:02:21,490 --> 03:02:23,380
Is it your father?
Who is it?

3942
03:02:23,470 --> 03:02:25,810
Who is hitting the past?
Um,

3943
03:02:26,260 --> 03:02:27,340
so this,
this,

3944
03:02:27,940 --> 03:02:29,170
this thing,
the store,

3945
03:02:29,171 --> 03:02:33,400
when it came out that all these people
that invested hundreds of millions of

3946
03:02:33,400 --> 03:02:34,890
dollars into it,
it made me think like,

3947
03:02:35,230 --> 03:02:40,230
can you imagine how long it takes to
make 100 million dollars to have 100

3948
03:02:40,870 --> 03:02:43,330
million dollars to invest in something
that's bullshit.

3949
03:02:44,560 --> 03:02:48,610
You imagine like what it must feel to
find out that that shit didn't work.

3950
03:02:49,100 --> 03:02:50,680
Like what?
Like yeah,

3951
03:02:50,681 --> 03:02:53,140
you invested in a scam.
It's all bullshit.

3952
03:02:54,070 --> 03:02:55,000
What?
Yeah,

3953
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:57,750
she's being charged with massive fraud.
No,

3954
03:02:58,080 --> 03:02:58,811
no.
Yeah,

3955
03:02:58,811 --> 03:03:00,490
you're $100.
Million dollars has gone.

3956
03:03:01,450 --> 03:03:04,330
What?
What the fuck did you just say your

3957
03:03:04,331 --> 03:03:09,250
hundred million dollars is gone.
They just got arrested.

3958
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:12,130
She got charged with massive fraud.
What?

3959
03:03:13,230 --> 03:03:17,810
I said she's in prison is happening on
the crypto market with the ico initial

3960
03:03:17,811 --> 03:03:18,950
coin offerings.
What's called.

3961
03:03:19,070 --> 03:03:24,070
People will make some sort of pitch and
pitch people that there are new startup

3962
03:03:24,171 --> 03:03:26,300
is worth it and instead of taking
investor money,

3963
03:03:26,301 --> 03:03:30,110
they take cryptocurrency if you will.
And then after they gain a bunch,

3964
03:03:30,111 --> 03:03:33,080
they just disappear.
It happens almost every week.

3965
03:03:33,081 --> 03:03:33,914
Now

3966
03:03:34,030 --> 03:03:39,030
exit scammers run off with 660 million
in ico earnings.

3967
03:03:39,970 --> 03:03:41,530
See,
this is like what you were saying about

3968
03:03:41,980 --> 03:03:46,540
the nigerian people getting online and
them not knowing certain scams and then

3969
03:03:46,541 --> 03:03:48,550
we get.
It's like scammers find a way in every

3970
03:03:48,551 --> 03:03:49,120
system.

3971
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:51,800
[inaudible].
There's not tons of scams out there.

3972
03:03:51,801 --> 03:03:54,290
They're just getting repurposed,
you know,

3973
03:03:54,300 --> 03:03:56,810
that just another trick,
they just put a little twist on it

3974
03:03:56,811 --> 03:03:58,160
changes name and it's a new scam,

3975
03:03:58,160 --> 03:03:59,750
but it's,
it's all the same scams.

3976
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:02,180
Actually.
You might want to know my pistol scam

3977
03:04:02,390 --> 03:04:03,380
postal.
Yeah.

3978
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:05,500
I've actually never done this.
But uh,

3979
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:08,180
it's like where you get arrested for
what you're about to say.

3980
03:04:08,270 --> 03:04:09,103
Well,
I don't know.

3981
03:04:10,390 --> 03:04:12,470
Well,
I've been approached on a pit bull

3982
03:04:13,280 --> 03:04:15,500
strong.
Those motherfuckers come down on you.

3983
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:17,660
I've never done it,
but this is something that uh,

3984
03:04:18,020 --> 03:04:20,990
I think somebody told me they used to do
in college.

3985
03:04:20,991 --> 03:04:23,240
I don't know.
I don't even know if it really works,

3986
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:26,240
but like I said,
like I wanted to send you a letter a.

3987
03:04:26,250 --> 03:04:30,470
I would put you as the uh,
yeah,

3988
03:04:30,500 --> 03:04:32,160
just switching return address and the
address.

3989
03:04:32,210 --> 03:04:33,890
Throw it in one of those blue mailboxes.
Hey,

3990
03:04:33,891 --> 03:04:34,341
they'll go,
hey.

3991
03:04:34,341 --> 03:04:37,910
No stamp returned to sender.
Now I sent you that letter.

3992
03:04:39,800 --> 03:04:42,500
Okay.
They probably know that one already.

3993
03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:43,011
Yeah,
they probably.

3994
03:04:43,011 --> 03:04:44,790
Do you do that with like a letter
though?

3995
03:04:44,810 --> 03:04:45,680
Probably.
Yeah.

3996
03:04:45,910 --> 03:04:46,760
Yeah.
They're probably like,

3997
03:04:46,761 --> 03:04:48,690
what?
How do you get all the way over here?

3998
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:56,180
She's dropped off in California.
It's supposed to be in Ohio.

3999
03:04:56,470 --> 03:04:58,690
Fuck out here.
They know better.

4000
03:04:59,630 --> 03:05:01,160
They know better today.
Yeah.

4001
03:05:01,161 --> 03:05:02,020
They're smarter than you,
bro.

4002
03:05:03,670 --> 03:05:08,060
There's like a hippie skin,
so let's be scared together.

4003
03:05:08,720 --> 03:05:11,090
Let's wrap this up.
We should be scared of technology.

4004
03:05:11,091 --> 03:05:12,880
Agreed.
That's great.

4005
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:14,120
This is getting out of hand.
Agreed.

4006
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:16,500
It's on sway.
What am I?

4007
03:05:16,590 --> 03:05:18,770
I definitely know I'm under the
influence of marijuana,

4008
03:05:19,130 --> 03:05:21,200
but I'm going fun.
Tell us a really fun technology.

4009
03:05:21,290 --> 03:05:23,930
It's very fun.
It's very fun to do this show.

4010
03:05:24,200 --> 03:05:26,300
Oh yeah.
I'm not anti technology.

4011
03:05:26,650 --> 03:05:28,550
I'm not even anti war.
This is going.

4012
03:05:28,551 --> 03:05:29,450

4013
03:05:29,720 --> 03:05:30,710

4014
03:05:30,711 --> 03:05:33,470
There's a waterfall coming up guys.
We're on a raft.

4015
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:36,170
There's a waterfall coming up.
You told me it's okay.

4016
03:05:36,260 --> 03:05:38,220
You can go over the waterfall.

4019
03:05:41,180 --> 03:05:42,530
I don't know if we're going over this
waterfall.

4020
03:05:42,531 --> 03:05:46,110
If we're going to make it will be fine.
Robot fucked off.

4021
