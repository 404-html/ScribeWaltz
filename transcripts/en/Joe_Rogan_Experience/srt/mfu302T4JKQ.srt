1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,610
The general good experience,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,471
I told my dad,

3
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,490
I wrote my dad this letter recently,

4
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,324
this getting real deep,

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,780
our number three of the podcast.

6
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:09,614
We get real deep.

7
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,540
We're pro nuance.

8
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,820
I'm ascending to my dad,

9
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:14,780
but he won't listen to this book.

10
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,700
I wrote this letter that was like,

11
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:17,534
listen man,

12
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,823
because I,

13
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,830
I had seen recently like his developing
relationship with my son and like it

14
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,470
shot it,

15
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,680
put this thought in my head that,

16
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,371
you know,

17
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:29,750
my relationship with my dad,

18
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:30,710
the kids caring for me.

19
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:33,770
The fact that he stayed with my mom and
they developed this like place for me to

20
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,800
grow and nurture me and allow me to
become a person in that environment.

21
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,260
Like there was a north star for
me when I left that environment.

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,280
Like I always,

23
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,370
I never wondered what
my path was going to be.

24
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,220
I always could look up and be
like that bond that I developed,

25
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:49,791
my family,

26
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,160
their love for me is like
the thing that I'm always,

27
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:52,911
you know,

28
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:53,661
I'm looking back too,

29
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:54,800
but also looking forward to.

30
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,030
Because that's what defines me
and regardless of what I do,

31
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,620
I can always fall back on that,

32
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,640
that my dad loves me,

33
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,540
my mom loves me,

34
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,680
I love them,

35
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,570
and I grew up like with the strength
of soul because I knew I don't have.

36
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,960
I have friends that came from
the same place that I did.

37
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,451
Same town.

38
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,300
I didn't Marilyn that odd on heroin.

39
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,010
They live in the same little suburb
suburbia community that I did.

40
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,840
They had parents that were the same age.

41
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:21,830
They went to the same high school,

42
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,050
they lived in the same environment.

43
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,100
They went down one way.

44
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:30,101
I went down another and I truly do feel
that that me going down that way was the

45
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:33,740
way that my parents like built
this structure around me.

46
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:34,640
That was always a route,

47
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:37,140
that bond and that love and
the things that that's very,

48
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,920
very fortunate and I.

49
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,200
and that's what in that me
being able to later on in life,

50
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:47,201
see how fortunate I was to
have that drove me to not fail

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,020
for someone like me.

52
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:52,500
It's so interesting to know that
there's still a considerable amount of

53
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,370
speculation.

54
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,503
Yes.

55
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,463
Oh yeah.

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,281
Well,

57
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:56,630
it's,

58
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,463
it's,

59
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,040
there's a lot of speculation,

60
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:04,041
but it is pretty off the wall and then
other people who think mine are off the

61
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,923
wall,

62
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,800
who's to,

63
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,600
who's to say,

64
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,021
okay,

65
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:07,854
I'm um,

66
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,880
I don't know man.

67
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:10,790
Okay.

68
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,623
You know,

69
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,650
did decent things in the past,

70
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:15,610
but you should just trust this abuse now.

71
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,850
So I guess that's what people think.

72
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,590
I don't know,

73
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:18,881
but you see,

74
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,651
if it was just me,

75
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,610
I could understand that,

76
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,280
but I've got these posts and I have a
colleague who's done things on this too

77
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,490
and it can't be that we're
all a little off the rails.

78
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:30,324
I think.

79
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,770
No,

80
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,280
it can't be.

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,540
There's something out there and
now with their hawking points,

82
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,500
there's something people can really go
out and look for and if they don't see it

83
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:37,591
in,

84
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,090
there's something funny
going on somewhere.

85
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
If they do see them,

86
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,730
there's something else
going funny on which,

87
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,340
which they'll have to think
of another explanation,

88
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,860
unless it's my explanation.

89
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,920
They'll have to think of a different
view from the current conflation view,

90
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,440
which is in real trouble
with these observations.

91
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,310
As far as I can see,

92
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,940
there is hate speech in the world isn't
you know you don't want it on your

93
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:57,630
platform,

94
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,530
but you got to decide what is hate speech,

95
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,070
when is

96
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,110
it really hate speech and
when is it just ignorance,

97
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,410
and sometimes the best way to combat bad
speech is to let that speech play out

98
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:12,070
and let good speech overwhelm it with
logic and reason and a better argument,

99
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,730
right?

100
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,600
That's really what freedom of speech is
supposed to be all about that we work

101
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,171
all this out.

102
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:21,220
As soon as you start censoring voices
and telling people that you're not going

103
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,270
to allow them to talk,

104
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,781
boy you,

105
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:24,614
you start,

106
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,440
you create this atmosphere where you
can start to choose what you're going to

107
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,680
allow through and when you're not going
to allow through and then you're gonna

108
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,390
start censoring things
that are far more subtle.

109
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,680
You're going to start censoring things
that you know they don't seem reasonable,

110
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,740
but you've decided that
it's already okay to sensor,

111
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,330
so you've censored this person,

112
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,200
negative sensor.

113
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,340
The next worst thing,

114
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,700
you're going to go down the line until
it's just people that disagree with you

115
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,431
and then you're like,

116
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:49,581
oh,

117
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:53,720
well my world is perfect now when in
fact it's actually just a bunch of people

118
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:54,940
that are talking shit about you.

119
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,640
Would you use just don't
happen to know about it.

120
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,010
The dove,

121
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,000
the Dove Company,

122
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,930
they're probably their most successful
campaign of all time has been one where

123
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:06,230
they argued that beauty
is a social construct.

124
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:08,270
You're all beautiful in your own way.

125
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,160
Now that again is a beautiful message,

126
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:10,371
right?

127
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:10,800
Because if,

128
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,750
if I am someone,

129
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,800
if I'm a woman who doesn't score well
on the typical evolutionary cues,

130
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,330
then what do I want to hear?

131
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,640
I want to hear that there is no
such thing as evolutionary cubes.

132
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,200
It's all socially constructed,

133
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:21,651
right?

134
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:22,760
If I have sagging breast,

135
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,190
if I have poor skin and so on,

136
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,600
if I have wrinkly skin,

137
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,560
I'd like to believe that there is
no such thing as an universal beauty

138
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,394
standards,

139
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,410
and in that sense dove has been incredibly
successful because by peddling false

140
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,400
hope,

141
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,330
they've actually been able to tap
into women's insecurities and incense.

142
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:42,164
That's good marketing,

143
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,970
right?

144
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,970
The cover of Cosmopolitan magazine that
was widely criticized because they had a

145
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:54,331
morbidly obese woman on who
was a bikini plus size model.

146
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:54,750
Yeah.

147
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,210
Yeah.

148
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,370
And they were challenging beauty norms.

149
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,640
Like this is a person that's
eating themselves to death.

150
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,930
You've got fucking assholes.

151
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,110
And so your lack of discipline and your
desire to shame people who exercise and

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,110
is what you're doing to make them feel
bad because you feel bad that you can't

153
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,111
put the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes
down as a lead you to try to push this

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,910
ridiculous standard.

155
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,290
And one of the things
my point of view was,

156
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,140
could you imagine if the cover of men's
health had an enormous fat guy with his

157
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,470
gut hanging over his belt and,

158
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,200
and people were saying the new standards
of attractiveness for men have been

159
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,250
changed by Mike who just drinks
beer and eat cake and be like,

160
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,210
get the fuck Outta here.

161
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,320
That's never going to fly.

162
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,580
It's not going to fly with men,

163
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,780
but it does fly with women.

164
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:43,871
Right?

165
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:43,930
And

166
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,763
by the way,

167
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,030
the fat acceptance movement doesn't
just argue that you know not being 500

168
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,930
pounds is unattractive
because of the patriarchy.

169
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,800
They actually argue that the medical
evidence suggesting that there is a link

170
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,010
between obesity

171
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,250
and downstream bad
effects is all bullshit.

172
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,030
They not,

173
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,800
not just that they there,

174
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,801
they also point to one incredibly flawed
study that has been wildly disproven

175
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,950
that says that there's some sort of
vigor or vitality involved in being

176
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,280
overweight because they get sick less.

177
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,420
There's no,

178
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,890
no truth to that whatsoever.

179
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:19,520
They only,

180
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,400
they only analyze people who
were healthy at the time.

181
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,161
Like it's,

182
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:23,840
it's,

183
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,430
you can go and Google the study and
find out the criticism of that study,

184
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,110
but it's 100 percent horseshit folks.

185
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,610
Being fat is not good for you.

186
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,310
It's really bad for you when you're
as big as that woman on the cover of

187
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,420
Cosmopolitan magazine.

188
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,940
She's literally morbidly obese.

189
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,500
She's fucking dying.

190
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,990
She's addicted to food in a horrible way.

191
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,310
And to promote that and pretend that
somehow or another this is okay,

192
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:47,144
and we're gonna.

193
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,550
We're gonna show new standards of beauty.

194
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,211
You Go,

195
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,260
you giant gelatinous
bag of meat and tissue.

196
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:54,831
No,

197
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,900
that's a dying person
who is addicted to food.

198
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,190
She doesn't want to look like that.

199
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,370
Most of my friends,

200
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:00,720
we all got busted for
drinking and driving.

201
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,220
The best one was a buddy of mine.

202
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,650
They read his was like,

203
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:04,921
you know,

204
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,410
approximately four in the morning.

205
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
We noticed a Maroon VW,

206
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,360
Fox blowing its horn,

207
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,650
trying to pass on the right.

208
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,840
We pulled the defendant over

209
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,580
after repeatedly asking the
defendant to stay in the car.

210
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,600
He got out of the car,

211
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,830
threw his keys at my feet
and repeatedly stated,

212
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:23,611
lock me up.

213
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:24,444
I'm fucked.

214
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,010
And this was funny was my
buddy was a good look can guy.

215
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,210
And the judge was a,

216
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,580
was a woman and when the guy read that,

217
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,481
you know,

218
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:41,141
lock me up,

219
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:41,891
I'm fucked up.

220
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:43,530
And he wasn't the brightest
guy and he just kind of,

221
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:44,050
when he went like,

222
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,520
Ugh,

223
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,830
he's like put his head down like that.

224
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,420
And he was,

225
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,253
you know,

226
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,150
little pound puppy fucking looking dude.

227
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,910
And she,

228
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,460
uh,

229
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,800
she,

230
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
she gave him like a lighter sentence
and because he was good looking.

231
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,030
I think so,

232
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,380
yeah,

233
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,770
plays in because my ugly
people are complaining so much

234
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,980
they won't take the time to
develop a fucking personality.

235
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:06,821
Right.

236
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,900
Some jokes do it.

237
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,870
The rest of us have to do like
I don't get mad at Brad Pitt,

238
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,870
you know,

239
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,320
and have it be fucking because
he's fucking beautiful.

240
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,220
I'm a fucking bald redheaded mail.

241
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,180
I know where I am in the pecking order
in some of these fucking people who

242
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,350
planning right now who are mad that
beautiful people get treated differently.

243
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,310
I understand racially speaking,

244
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,140
but you're not going to
do the beautiful thing.

245
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,280
And then that's another
thing they tried to say.

246
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,950
Well Society tries to,

247
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:35,290
you know,

248
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,020
they're the ones that fucking like,

249
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,470
you know,

250
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,060
like I love when like
there's a supermodel,

251
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:39,720
like the,

252
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,080
this is like an impossible standard
of beauty to try and live up to.

253
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,914
Yeah,

254
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,060
yeah,

255
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,470
yeah.

256
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,420
That's why she's on the
cover of a magazine.

257
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,530
She's that level.

258
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:49,160
Beautiful.

259
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,390
And you're going to try and sit there
and tell me that that was learned.
