1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,780
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,310
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,103
Kelly slater,
we've been talking about doing this for 

4
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:09,090
how long?
Couple of years.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,340
While for having me.
Thanks for being here.

6
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,840
I'm glad we finally got a chance to do 
it.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,570
What are you in California for?
I know you broke your foot,

8
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,160
right?
I broke my foot real bad.

9
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:18,690
I have to do that.
Might.

10
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:22,800
Well my girlfriend's from San Clemente 
and her family lives there and uh,

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,753
so we kind of live here.
We're not moving around too much so I'm 

12
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,680
just going to here right now.
I'm not competing.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,993
I broke my foot.
I was surfing in South Africa about 15 

14
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:37,470
months ago and I was just on a wave that
I wouldn't consider a very big wave.

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,640
Nobody would really considered dangerous
and it all kind of closed out,

16
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,151
which is,
you know,

17
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:42,984
when it all breaks at once,
I just pulled into thing because I was 

18
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:49,371
going to sort of wash on the rocks right
where that was and change boards and uh,

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,400
I was practicing.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,380
I had to compete and about two hours 
from then.

21
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,983
So I was just testing out different 
boards for some reason I wasn't riding 

22
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,380
the board,
I was planning on writing competition so

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,723
I was going to come in and change and 
switch to my norm board and I just 

24
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,394
pulled this wave and just,
I kinda hesitated like usually you 

25
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,274
either ride those out and stay on your 
board or you jump off and I was kind of 

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,420
between the two and I kind of lifted my 
front foot off my back foot.

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,283
My leg was straight because I was kinda 
going to think I was going to jump off 

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,560
and as my foot got my leg got locked 
back straight.

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,630
The board flipped in.
Oh,

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,720
against the toes.
And it just broke the top of my foot and

31
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,730
a half.
Like immediate.

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,710
Like there was my guy.
Yeah,

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,603
we're looking at a photograph of the 
expert right now and it's like every 

34
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:33,240
bone it's snapped.

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,410
Well what you can't see.
So do you know,

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,430
are you aware of the Liz Frank joint 
niches?

37
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,980
Like that's where the first big 
metatarsal comes together.

38
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,260
So that first big joint on top of the 
foot there.

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,040
Why is it called a Liz frank joint list?
Frank was a doctor,

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,570
I think is what I am.
I could,

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,470
we could look this up.
I think that was the person that did the

42
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,304
original surgery when you used to break 
your foot in a stirrup back 100 years 

43
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,140
ago.
They used to cut your foot off.

44
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,110
Oh God damn it.
Ah,

45
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,040
so,
so that was,

46
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,750
what was it?
Uh,

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,110
that was kind of how this sort of joint 
got famous.

48
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,220
But normally what happens is those toes,
those two bones right there,

49
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:15,930
the first and second metatarsal can 
either spread or converge one way or the

50
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:16,764
other.
And that's usually what a liz frank 

51
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:18,450
fracture is.

52
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,580
I had the best of the three,
which is,

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,610
I had a crack.
You can just see on the right side of.

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,113
Yeah,
if you go down with the cursor right 

55
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,060
there,
just a little lower.

56
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,930
There's a little crack right there,
uh,

57
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,990
right there on that corner.
And then the next one broke across.

58
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:36,270
You can just see right there.
It's cracked across.

59
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,000
And then so it kind of went in a line up
and across the foot.

60
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,470
And then the other two are just 
destroyed.

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,210
The third one displaced the fourth when 
shattered into eight pieces.

62
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,610
The doctor said he lost count putting 
them back together and then,

63
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,680
you know,
you,

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,513
you would know from injuries.
The problem with when the shatters of 

65
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,550
bone,
they're not getting the blood flow.

66
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:56,460
So it's not like a four or five week 
repair job.

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,353
It's like,
that was like nine months before that 

68
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,070
thing was together properly.

69
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,143
So when they do that,
how do they piece that shattered one 

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,833
back together again?
A delicately and they put like a mesh 

71
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,883
over.
So I got to kind of like figure out how 

72
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,000
to.
Well I had,

73
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,130
I had a plate on the list,
frank,

74
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:15,964
and then it had a plant play,
a kind of a bridge across the third and 

75
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,254
fourth.
And so they kind of meshed it all 

76
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,134
together.
And then,

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,393
uh,
I think I had 16 screws combined in all 

78
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,440
that.
God Damn.

79
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,460
Um,
it was,

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,630
it was,
it was brutal.

81
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,200
The problem with it was I did it in 
South Africa where I wasn't going to get

82
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,034
surgery,
so I had to wait for the swelling to go 

83
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,540
down for about six days before I could 
fly.

84
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,763
Oh God.
Because they thought it was going to 

85
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,280
swell too much because it was already 
swollen from the event.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,690
So I shit on my foot for like five days 
and sat there and watched.

87
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,853
Unfortunately the waves were perfect,
so I was sitting on the beach as 

88
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,370
watching perfect waves and you know,
it's like,

89
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,800
that's like as painful as the injury to 
a surfer,

90
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,200
you know,
it's like watching a bunch of elk walked

91
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,020
by in front of you and,
and not,

92
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,360
not scared of you.
And uh,

93
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,013
um,
so I sat there because the whole time 

94
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,330
prior to me being injured while I was 
there for like two weeks,

95
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,223
the ways weren't very good.
So I broke my foot in the way he's got 

96
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,924
great.
Oh.

97
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,990
So I had to watch it,
so it's,

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,690
that's painful for us.
But uh,

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,033
so then I waited for the swelling to go 
down and then it's too red eyes to get 

100
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,184
back.
Was there no way you could get it fixed 

101
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:23,650
in South Africa?

102
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,693
I maybe could have,
but then I was probably looking at St 

103
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,173
Africa for a month or more in and also I
didn't know that the quality sort of 

104
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,510
level of quality of doctor I was going 
to get there.

105
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,770
And I got a doctor I work with here and 
I called him straightaway.

106
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,613
I said,
look,

107
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,340
it's my fourth broken foot,
but I've never broken it like this.

108
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,290
Usually it's like let it heal for four 
weeks.

109
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,330
And you're surfing and it's all from 
surfing.

110
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,520
Yeah.
In offering the same way.

111
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,413
I'll really,
really pretty much the board going back 

112
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,600
against the foot fall.
Um,

113
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,120
because.
And usually it happens when I'm,

114
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,583
you know,
I don't know how well versed you are in 

115
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,114
surfing,
but when I'm tube riding and usually 

116
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,220
with my back to the wave,
which has happened two or three times.

117
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,760
So I'm in the wave,
the lip pitches over and lands.

118
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,300
But when that lands it sends a shock 
back into the way.

119
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,050
Like,
you know,

120
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,883
when the lip hits flatwater that lip,
some of the energy goes down and some 

121
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,400
disperses out and up and some comes back
into the tube,

122
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,350
so if it does that and you're in the 
wrong spot,

123
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:23,040
the board will flip into your feet,
but oh wow.

124
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,800
Normally what we do is we were,
when you rubbed backside barrel ride,

125
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:27,634
a lot of times you're grabbing the rail 
so you kind of have both your feet and 

126
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,230
your hand on it so you can handle that 
shock,

127
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,540
but if you're just going no hand 
backside,

128
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,853
it's usually pretty big intense barrel 
and so that lip has a lot of energy and 

129
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:42,520
it shoots a ton of force back towards 
you.

130
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:44,200
And if,
if it hits your board just rolling,

131
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,430
it can flip in your foot and break it.

132
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,280
Do you know anybody else's broken their 
foot like you like that?

133
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,310
Not this bad.
I'm one guy on tour broke his foot.

134
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,280
Pretty bad knee requiring surgery this 
year.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
That looks horrible,
man.

136
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,250
How long was it before you can walk?
You're walking.

137
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,084
Totally normal now.
So how long has it been since the 

138
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:05,291
surgery?
I had surgery in July last year and then

139
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,860
walking normal wasn't until maybe 
December,

140
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,150
January.
Well,

141
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,790
December I competed again,
but I probably shouldn't have,

142
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,210
but we're,
we're at pipeline in Hawaii,

143
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,980
which is,
you're not doing maneuvers.

144
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,880
It's not a small wave kind of 
competence.

145
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,733
If the waves are small,
I wouldn't have served since it's 

146
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:26,954
bigger.
It's a little easier because you take 

147
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,040
off and kind of trim a straight line.
So you're kind of going straight,

148
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,600
you know,
even though you're writing the barrel,

149
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,600
you're kind of going straight,
but are you conscious of your foot being

150
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,380
compromised?

151
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,880
Yeah.
Wow.

152
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,333
I don't know.
I just,

153
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,050
that's my favorite event in the world,
so I just didn't want to miss it.

154
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
But fuck.
If you broke your foot again.

155
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,460
Yeah.
But then you know,

156
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,440
the bones were pretty good back together
then.

157
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,274
And I could walk somewhat without pain 
and if I put myself in a real 

158
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,980
vulnerable,
vulnerable,

159
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,460
vulnerable position on a wave,
I would kind of maybe jump off,

160
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,750
you know,
I wouldn't really push it.

161
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,420
It's not worth winning a contest,
dillon foot again,

162
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,254
but I'm sure to be able to surf pipeline
with no one out is kind of worth the 

163
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,010
risk.
Now when you are healing,

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,000
is there anything they give you that can
accelerate bone healing or is there any.

165
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,010
Supplements are.
A lot of.

166
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:19,940
It is kind of.
I mean it's the furthest place from your

167
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:20,511
heart,
right?

168
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:21,210
So.
And it's,

169
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,260
it's down at the bottom of your body,
so you got to kind of get that foot up.

170
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,093
Like a lot of times I'll sit against a 
wall and elevate my foot and let it 

171
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:28,934
completely flush out.
You know when you're a kid and you kind 

172
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,350
of hold your hand and somebody pushed 
all the blood out of your hand,

173
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:34,850
you ever do that one?
No.

174
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:37,400
It's like this trick where somebody hold
your,

175
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,660
your,
your,

176
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,370
your arteries.
So No blood's going in,

177
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,430
you push all the hands,
all the blood out and then you let it go

178
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:46,080
and it's like a little spider web feels 
like if somebody goes like that,

179
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,800
it was killing a spider web.
I did do that when I was a kid.

180
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,673
So it was forgotten,
I just kind of imagined that's what I 

181
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,180
was doing with my foot up and like,
oh,

182
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,033
okay,
all the blood's getting out of my foot 

183
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,634
now and I'm a.
But did you like research whether 

184
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,290
there's something that accelerates bone 
healing or you can use magnets.

185
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,700
Magnets,
yes.

186
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:09,410
Some people believe magnets help 
increase the circulation and thus the,

187
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,640
the uh,
especially,

188
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:11,474
uh,
rotating magnet because it kind of 

189
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:14,930
creates a force field around your foot.
Really?

190
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,190
Yeah.
Supposedly,

191
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,580
I mean,
around the magnets.

192
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,060
Is this like,
are these legit people are,

193
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:24,120
these days are like theories healer's 
healer,

194
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,243
energy healer.
While I'm just saying what I've heard 

195
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:29,420
people.
So the first time I broke my foot,

196
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,390
a guy,
a chiropractor,

197
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,880
Guy I had gone to,
he's like,

198
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,510
just when you go to sleep,
it's not going to hurt,

199
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,180
you just put her on your foot.
And I was actually competing,

200
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,480
uh,
five weeks after I broke that foot.

201
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,493
So I don't know if it helped or not,
but I just asleep and it was near my 

202
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,980
foot and maybe it helped.
That takes six weeks for a bone heal,

203
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:50,030
right?
Doesn't it?

204
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,223
When you're on to take four weeks and 
then it takes two more weeks for the 

205
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,160
calcium to properly fill in.

206
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,383
So like the.
If you take an extra after four weeks 

207
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,700
it'll still look like there's a whole,
like a break there,

208
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,330
but apparently the bone has sutured 
itself back.

209
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,320
But if calcium has not filled in to make
it totally strong.

210
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,263
That's what I was told by my doctor on 
this last one because I asked every 

211
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:17,510
question possible why is it still look 
broken?

212
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,720
Why is it.
And he was telling me,

213
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,554
you know,
it's not till you get enough blood flow 

214
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,223
and then it's.
And then it's once there's the proper 

215
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,790
blood flow in the bone,
then you get the calcium coming back.

216
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,624
And the only thing that I've heard too 
that really is supposed to accelerate 

217
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:33,060
healing is a hyperbaric chamber.
Which I didn't do.

218
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,060
I had one sort of at hand in Hawaii I 
could have gone to,

219
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:37,500
but I didn't know I was supposed to.

220
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,220
I know that Uriah Faber use that a lot 
after he fought Josie Aldo,

221
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,670
although kick the shit out of his leg 
and his leg was really badly.

222
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,290
Swollen was horrible.
No Bra.

223
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,550
Did he break the bone?
No,

224
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:48,840
it didn't break the bone,
but it was.

225
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,674
It was so bad.
It was like his left leg was literally 

226
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,850
twice the size.
And remember Paul,

227
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,130
I've seen the.
I've seen the flight photo.

228
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:57,964
Are you talking there it is right there.
There's a photo and in the fight you're 

229
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,650
talking about.
Look at the color on his leg.

230
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,650
It was so nasty.
That was.

231
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,280
Although when he was in his prime and he
didn't see those kicks,

232
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,350
you couldn't see his kicks coming.
He was just like,

233
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,780
he doesn't even load up it just there.
That's probably right afterwards.

234
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,733
It must've felt broken.
It feels fucking horrible just to get 

235
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,070
hit once,
man.

236
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,751
I mean,
you're right.

237
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:24,990
It's so tough to just take that over and
over and over again.

238
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,130
Like he did.
Was He.

239
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,730
Can you check those and what it can you 
turn it into?

240
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,583
Um,
the problem is when you get hit what 

241
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,490
just getting hit once by a guy who's 
really good,

242
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,324
like a peter or,
or someone who's like a really good leg 

243
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,350
kicker,
they hit you once and you're,

244
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,540
you're not even going to lift your leg 
upright.

245
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,800
Well,
think of a Charlie horse,

246
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:46,340
that guy gives you in school when you're
a kid and how bad that,

247
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,710
that's probably 10 times out of 10 times
whatever it is.

248
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,120
There's a Nesto who's probably one of 
the greatest lessons,

249
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,023
not probably,
definitely one of the greatest lake 

250
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:55,814
carriers of all time.
And there's a video called the perfect 

251
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,154
leg kick by Ernesto,
who's then it just shows you like a 

252
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:02,454
compilation of him landing leg kicks in 
people and you just see like you see 

253
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,150
their,
their,

254
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,280
their legs buckle.

255
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,170
And,
and he would walk with him.

256
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,770
He would whip it down like he had this 
angle.

257
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,311
They said,
yeah,

258
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:16,140
he's a long,
tall guy.

259
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,650
And his technique was just perfect.
Oh no video of him.

260
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,060
He was so good.
Watch his left,

261
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,650
left kick or left kick and then left 
hooked rather than the right leg kick.

262
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,484
The way he goes,
you're covering up top and you don't 

263
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:28,910
mind maybe even see it.
Hook.

264
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,180
Look at this though.
Being the,

265
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,620
just the,
the whip into it.

266
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,940
He was so good,
man.

267
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,510
He was so fucking good and he would 
always do it.

268
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,700
Left,
left hook to the body.

269
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,160
And then right leg kick afterwards.
Uh,

270
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,050
Ricardo Arona a buddy of mine.
You Know Ricardo?

271
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,510
No Ricardo pretty well.
Yeah.

272
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,980
CSR for.
Yeah,

273
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,460
he surfs a lot of Brazilian guys surfing
now.

274
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,380
But who did he kick rampage or somebody 
in the lower leg?

275
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,480
Like I think Vendrell a,
I don't know,

276
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,200
back in the pride days and uh,
I think he killed,

277
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,290
broke someone's lower leg or something.
Sure.

278
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,040
He was the victim of the worst slam I've
ever seen in my life.

279
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,641
Well,
he told me,

280
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,230
he's like,
I don't know why I didn't grab the leg.

281
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,350
Yeah.
And the thing I didn't realize because I

282
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,480
had watched the fight before and I 
didn't pick this up.

283
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,960
I wasn't very well versed at that time 
in watching fights,

284
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,190
but he goes,
he goes,

285
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:21,641
Kelly,
you know,

286
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,474
the thing was I put him to sleep in the 
fight before that and I let him go and 

287
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,460
then told the rep,
you sleeping,

288
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,870
he's sleeping.
And he goes,

289
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,183
and then he woke back up and the rough 
kind of you can watch it and it touched 

290
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,571
them.
Goes okay.

291
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:34,660
Keep fighting.
Yeah.

292
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:35,590
What?
Did he catch them with?

293
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,780
A triangle or something?
I'm kind of trying.

294
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,670
Yeah.
Uh,

295
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,050
no it wasn't a triangle was a teen or 
something.

296
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,480
Might have been a good team.
They were on the ground.

297
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,780
So yeah.
You like or maybe knocked him out,

298
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,660
know I thought he put him to sleep or 
something.

299
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,100
I don't know if it was.
Anyways.

300
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,380
Yeah.
But then rampage woke up.

301
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,910
Yeah.
And then kept finding rough like,

302
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,370
oh yeah,
we'll pride was crazy.

303
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,204
Yeah.
They would have let you fight to the 

304
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,400
death.
If I went to a.

305
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,720
was it a k?
One?

306
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,420
I watched Kitty Yamamoto and an inhaler 
fight.

307
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,090
Oh Wow.
And uh,

308
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,820
you know,
I had run into hoist the night before.

309
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,050
Just saw him at a bar and he's like,
what's up?

310
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,310
And I'm like,
I'm leaving.

311
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,990
I'm going to fly out tomorrow.
He goes,

312
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:14,824
no,
you've got to come to my brother's 

313
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:15,784
flight.

314
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,680
So I went to the fight and then got 
knocked out.

315
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:18,514
Man.
It was.

316
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,990
It was hard to walk.
What did he fight?

317
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,670
Hitler fought.
Could Yamamoto.

318
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,540
Yeah,
that's right.

319
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,030
That's when it was five.
Yeah.

320
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:28,270
He was getting involved in mma and he 
really didn't have any striking.

321
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,580
Yeah,
he was out cold for a couple of minutes.

322
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,414
I was like,
did they just offer him a shit load of 

323
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,390
money?
Like why did he decide to take?

324
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,170
I don't know.
I,

325
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,670
I,
I,

326
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,020
I had never met earlier at that time he 
fought.

327
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,470
He fought a bunch of people.
Sakharova,

328
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,553
which is really crazy.
And Sakharova had him in a Kamora with 

329
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,064
his arm way behind his back and they 
stopped the fight rather than let him 

330
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,020
get his arm broken because he wasn't 
tapping.

331
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,460
Yeah.
But he was like,

332
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,750
mom,
really flexible.

333
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,770
Like I wasn't gonna tap.

334
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,570
I can,
I can do that.

335
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,270
Yeah.
I see some of these yogis.

336
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,280
I follow this guy,
this Yogi guy,

337
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,160
and I think this guy named,
uh,

338
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,430
go Kula chondral or something and he,
he,

339
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,264
um,
he puts these poses up and I think if 

340
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:10,204
this guy did Jujitsu,
there's no way somebody could tap him 

341
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,900
out because he,
he's doing,

342
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,090
he's the craziest.
I don't know how you put your.

343
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,013
I've never seen somebody put their body 
in these contortionists positions and 

344
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:24,680
you just wonder if somebody who's a real
true contortionists if they knew Jujitsu

345
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,533
and how to escape things.
If they could ever really get tagged 

346
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,680
with like arms,
I'm sure next or gay teens or whatever.

347
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,060
But what do you got here,
Jamie?

348
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,373
Oh,
there was a guy thought we were showing 

349
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:35,440
us some.
There's a guy named Ray who was,

350
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,190
oh,
look at this guy did follow this guy.

351
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,420
Yeah,
he's,

352
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,560
my God.
It's insane.

353
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,780
He does these poses where he's,
he's balancing on his elbow and he said,

354
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,960
and then the rest of his bodies in these
poses.

355
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,920
It's insane poses and stuff.
One go above that,

356
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,860
right there on the far right.
Jamie.

357
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,900
That one when he's on one hand,
it's amazing.

358
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,780
That's fucking nuts,
man.

359
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,630
Yeah.
This kind of stuff and the strengths and

360
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,090
the amount of time you had to take to 
learn these things.

361
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,920
It's like,
it's.

362
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,140
I mean,
that's sort of a martial art in itself.

363
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,070
Oh yeah.
Well,

364
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,930
um,
there's a guy who's a famous Jujitsu guy

365
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,960
who once said that yoga is a martial art
that you do against yourself.

366
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,510
Yeah.
There's,

367
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,580
my friend Ray is a,
he was a lead singer of a band re Capo.

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He was a lead singer of some punk band 
and then became a Yogi.

369
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,470
Hm.
Yeah.

370
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,390
And we called Yoga Ray and uh,
he would uh,

371
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,253
come to 10th planet and he would just,
he could move in ways he likes without 

372
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,050
fuck.
Are you doing man?

373
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,893
Like his body was.
So he had so much dexterity and 

374
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:45,614
flexibility.
It was impossible to like hold them in 

375
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,620
positions.
Like he just could move.

376
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,470
Segue your two belts below me,
but I can't pin you.

377
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,900
Well,
he was actually a very high ranking guy.

378
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,033
He was really good at Jujitsu.
He had this crazy yo and he also had 

379
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,760
amazing breath work.
Like he,

380
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,100
he,
he never got tired,

381
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:10,610
like his cardio is incredible,
but it was all because of his,

382
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,533
his breathing techniques.
Hixson hixson would work on a lot of 

383
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:15,100
breathing stuff.
Yeah.

384
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,430
Yeah.
He was like,

385
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,180
I've,
I've,

386
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,310
uh,
I've known Hickson quite a long time and

387
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,233
he always talks about that when you 
breathe through your nose and how you 

388
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,204
calm your heart and you have to panic 
breathing through your mouth is what 

389
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,100
they would call know when you panic.

390
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,933
Breathe.
Yeah.

391
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,620
Yeah.
Most people in their title.

392
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,740
But he was always about control,
controlling your breath,

393
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,960
go.
And he was like,

394
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,203
you know,
prior to him doing his thing and 

395
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,530
becoming sort of,
well known,

396
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,364
he hixon would go sit and cold ice cold 
streams and just real calm through the 

397
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,350
nose and control,
you know?

398
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,830
Yeah.
That's in that movie choke.

399
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:51,560
He's in a glacial river and he's just 
sitting,

400
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:55,550
we're neck deep in and everybody else 
just dipped their foot.

401
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,570
And I'm like,
fuck this.

402
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,120
Yeah,
he's in,

403
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,370
in the freezing cold water.
Just loving it.

404
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,230
Yeah.
He's a fascinating guy and he was really

405
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,064
the first guy that sort of introduced 
martial artists to the power of yoga 

406
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,220
because he was the best that stomach 
work he could do,

407
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,073
you know?
Yeah.

408
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,280
It's like freaky freaky.

409
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,500
Yeah.
We've played that.

410
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:19,910
It's from the movie choke.
Yeah,

411
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,970
that's what it's called.
A fire breathing or some blank breath of

412
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:23,804
fire.
There's like a word for that kind of 

413
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,353
breathing.
It's probably more just if you'll go to 

414
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:29,961
a class and they'll go,
okay,

415
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,180
breath of fire is right.
That's just like that.

416
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:35,960
But he had his.
He could pull his stomach in and move it

417
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:36,794
side to side in some weird way.
He said like he could use every muscle 

418
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:40,994
in his body individually,
like move it independent of other 

419
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:45,680
muscles.
That's a weird one.

420
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,750
He also loves surfing.
I Love Surfing.

421
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,460
Given boards to for a long time.
Really?

422
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:51,780
Yeah.
That's so cool.

423
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,460
Yeah,
it's amazing.

424
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:56,560
How many Jujitsu Guys Love Surfing.
Yeah,

425
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,473
there's an endless.
Is it just because of Rio and Rio is 

426
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,103
like just a place.
It's they all sorta and and sort of 

427
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,580
played soccer and serve there on the 
beach.

428
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,160
So they're kind of doing these things 
and some volleyball with their feet,

429
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,510
whatever you call that thing.
Right,

430
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,080
right,
right.

431
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,620
What is that?
Slams are sick.

432
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:17,454
It's crazy.
But I posted a video of these guys in 

433
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:23,600
Thailand that we're doing that.
They were playing volleyball,

434
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,370
a version of volleyball with their feet 
and it's fucking wild man.

435
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:30,150
It's like the ultimate hacky sack.
It's the craziest shit.

436
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:30,984
Like the dexterity they have with their 
feet where they're whacking the ball 

437
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:34,314
over and then the other guy on the other
side is whacking it back and it's like 

438
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:40,860
they're catching it with their foot.
Oh look at this angle is they get.

439
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,790
Yeah.
I mean the flexibility to.

440
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,430
And these guys are really close to each 
other too.

441
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,353
Yeah.
That's must be some good fails that 

442
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,850
kicks into face.
Sure.

443
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,180
I'm sure there's a lot of that.
What's it called?

444
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,570
Well this is Koreans are.
Boom,

445
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,770
look at that kid.
Oh my God.

446
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:02,604
That's insane.
And then you have to fall in your hands 

447
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,130
and hope you don't break your wrists 
falling.

448
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,540
I wonder if they got added a floor like 
a,

449
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,060
you know,
like a mat on Dojo.

450
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,190
This is pretty impressive stuff.
But Jamie,

451
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,190
see if you find that video that I posted
on my instagram page,

452
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,353
I reposted somebody else posting it.
It's fucking bananas because these guys 

453
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:22,944
are using this little shitty ball in the
jungle and just the ability that they 

454
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,370
have with their feet is just out of this
world.

455
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,940
You ever hear of a guy named Sir Donald 
Brat?

456
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,740
Uh,
Gosh,

457
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,940
I forget his name.
Bradman.

458
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,774
I believe it was.
He used the best crooked player of all 

459
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:39,570
time.
No,

460
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,640
that's cricketer of all time.
So he grew up in Australia.

461
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,080
Outback and he,
he,

462
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,243
I guess from what I heard,
there wasn't many people around and he 

463
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,580
used to play,
uh,

464
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,563
he would take a stick,
just a random stick and he would hit a 

465
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:54,360
ball against a corrugated,
curved a wall,

466
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,220
corrugated aluminum,
you know,

467
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,620
one of those kind of bended walls and 
they use for roofing and uh,

468
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,690
so the ball would just bounce off at all
these different angles and uh,

469
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,100
hit his hand.

470
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,290
Eye Coordination became like,
you know,

471
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,360
as good as you could possibly ever have 
because it was like his fun thing to do.

472
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,413
Check these guys out,
look at this crazy shit and I saw you 

473
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,050
look at this and off the head and it 
looks like these perfect shots,

474
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:24,000
but they keep firing it back at each 
other.

475
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,930
Look at that off the head and it sounds 
hard.

476
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:29,610
It sounds like a coconut or something,
you know?

477
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,390
Right.
It sounds like they made it at a like,

478
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,080
like a rock and some fucking.
Oh,

479
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,410
how was that?
How was that kicks?

480
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,970
That was just straight up martial arts.
It was like a push,

481
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,080
kick,
push kick,

482
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:43,710
but a roundhouse kick at the same time.
Like a push crescent kick.

483
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,960
This guy.
I mean.

484
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,973
Oh,
and the block if you can get good at 

485
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,174
doing that.
I guess it is tie because those are tie 

486
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,170
writing,
but if you could get good at that man.

487
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,760
I mean there's certain guys that just 
when you see them in Moitai they have.

488
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,870
Oh,
that's what it's called me.

489
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,080
Seapak top gras.
It's Burmese.

490
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,973
Oh,
okay.

491
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,860
Soccer and volleyball put together.
Yeah.

492
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:09,694
Those guys would be awesome fighters.
There's certain guys that have just 

493
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:14,860
insane leg dexterity that you see in 
martial arts.

494
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,694
Like do you know sunshine is ever see 
Sanchez Sanchez leg kicks would be 

495
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,313
insane.
Yeah.

496
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,760
Well he's everything.
He's,

497
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,773
he's.
There's a famous highlight reel of him 

498
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,023
where he throws this like fake knee off 
the right and then jumping roundhouse 

499
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:32,700
kicks this guy in the face and chaos and
with his left and it's just the,

500
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,583
the,
the ability that he has to place his 

501
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,030
foot like anywhere he wants.

502
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,030
His dexterity just out the world is a 
range.

503
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:42,070
Would just be other worldly.
Right?

504
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,270
Yeah.
Well that's.

505
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,060
I mean,
Tisha slept there.

506
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,923
He is.
Oh yeah.

507
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,000
No,
definitely younger guy.

508
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,490
And he was essentially.
I was talking about.

509
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,900
They're asking about connor fighting.
Conor.

510
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:55,510
He ever see that thing?
He's like,

511
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:56,440
no,
I'd kill this guy.

512
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,230
Fuck him up so bad.
Like he probably let it go.

513
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,870
Okay,
kick me a few times on this trade.

514
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,763
Let's try it.
A couple.

515
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,830
He's so hard to hit to Sanchez.
Just so elusive.

516
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,790
Why wouldn't someone like him in,
in a UFC fight?

517
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,210
He doesn't know how to fight on the 
ground.

518
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,320
I mean,
that's all it is.

519
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,600
It's just they just pin him with another
standup guy.

520
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,000
If they were smart,
yeah,

521
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,834
that would be the smart thing to do,
but I'm not going to put Sam punk and 

522
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,500
gets another ground guy,
are Ya?

523
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,020
Well,
that's.

524
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,990
That would be a disaster.
Cm punk.

525
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:28,870
That whole thing was everybody's like,
I could do it.

526
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,260
You know,
you watch cm punk.

527
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:31,000
You're like,
fuck,

528
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,430
I'll fucking fight.
Like I guarantee you,

529
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,413
Sam,
Sam punks probably a lot tougher than 

530
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,050
the average guy anyway.
I mean,

531
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,250
I don't know.
I don't know fighting,

532
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:41,590
but you know,
even in the average fighter,

533
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,880
no nothing.
Average fighter,

534
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,650
but maybe the average guy in a bar,
right?

535
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,633
Cm punk is a real nice guy and I don't 
want to say anything bad about them 

536
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,320
because I mean the guy gave it his all.
He really did.

537
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,490
Totally,
totally dedicated.

538
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,640
I don't have some humble pie and he was 
totally cool about it.

539
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,593
He was in these cool about it the first 
time and he was cool about the second 

540
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,440
time.
He's a real good guy,

541
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,530
but he doesn't have what I would call 
talent.

542
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,980
The skill just moves wrong.
He doesn't see them against.

543
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:07,814
When Mickey Golar came in and just went 
over the top and he was probably so 

544
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,780
nervous to never being in that situation
of a real flight.

545
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,790
I mean,
he's been in front of the crowds,

546
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:19,540
but that was a nightmare that micky gall
fight was so ridiculous.

547
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,940
Micky gall is fucking good.
He's really good.

548
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,803
He's fucking.
And to have a guy like cm punk that 

549
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:25,714
doesn't have a back.
It's not like brock Lesnar Brock Lesnar 

550
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:30,790
came to the UFC.
He was a wrestler.

551
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,980
He's a fucking gorilla.
As a human being,

552
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,190
just a freak athlete.
Cm punk is a regular guy like he's not.

553
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,064
There's nothing freaky about it.
He doesn't have crazy power or weird 

554
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,060
speed.
You don't see them and go,

555
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:46,090
that guy looks super scary for a guy his
size.

556
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,760
I mean there's guys that don't look like
sand.

557
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Chai himself does not look like a freak 
freaky so frequently,

558
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,640
but when you see him,
he looks,

559
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,350
he looks like an athlete,
but he doesn't look like you know.

560
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,040
It's not like Roy Jones Jr and his prime
or something.

561
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,030
When you see them,
you just go,

562
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:03,230
Jesus,
so you're this fucking guy.

563
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,990
He was just,
I mean he's just so good.

564
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,820
But a guy like cm punk,
he didn't have a background and he tried

565
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:13,730
martial arts when he was like 30.
So he had no background.

566
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,940
Not Real in the even wrestling 
background.

567
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,240
No,
he didn't even wrestle.

568
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,720
It was all theatrical.
Wrestling was all entertainment,

569
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,623
you know,
you would think though that those guys 

570
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,350
would even,
even the theatrical reffing,

571
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:27,620
they would go and work on the skill like
day in,

572
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:30,030
day out mean that's all you have to be 
as a wrestler.

573
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:31,220
Right.
This is such a difference,

574
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,054
but you can work on the scale day in,
day out and then work on skill and 

575
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,450
someone doesn't want you to do it to 
them.

576
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,680
Yeah.
That's the thing.

577
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,810
And then when they're trying to do 
things to you,

578
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,130
like,
just fucking you up.

579
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,780
Yeah.
And just nothing you can do about it.

580
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,670
Like in your mouth breathing.

581
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,330
Everything's wrong.
But I mean,

582
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:50,570
I'm sure he made a ton of money and he,
oh,

583
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,010
he tested himself,
the guy,

584
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,740
I mean give the guy credit.
He really did test himself.

585
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,040
I think it was a good thing for,
for Dan and everyone to see,

586
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,370
to like,
oh okay,

587
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,550
we're not going to do that.
Let's not,

588
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,233
let's not put someone in that position 
that's not put ourselves in that 

589
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,870
position.
But they were talking about like Logan,

590
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,920
Paul Logan,
Paul fighting in the UFC,

591
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:12,290
and he was like,
Logan Paul and get killed.

592
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,190
Logan.
Paul is fucking way better,

593
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,203
way better than cm punk.
Logan Paul like actually knows how to 

594
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,284
fight.
He had a boxing match with another 

595
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,563
youtube guy.
But I was watching him throw punches in 

596
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:26,750
that fight.
I'm like,

597
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,540
this is a guy who actually knows how to 
punch like kids punches looked good.

598
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,393
He gassed out.
He got a little tired first real fight 

599
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:34,100
like that.

600
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,310
But he has a background in wrestling and
he,

601
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,470
he actually can punch.
Like I was watching him punch this guy.

602
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,304
I was like,
that's a guy who actually knows how to 

603
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:43,550
throw punches.
He now he knows how to,

604
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,593
he knows distance and timing,
he knows how to connect and he doesn't 

605
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,370
look like Canelo Alvarez or anything 
crazy,

606
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:51,310
but he looks like a guy who can actually
punch more.

607
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,000
You can give him a break on that.
But Dana is like,

608
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:54,440
you know,
have him fight in the UFC would be,

609
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:58,130
he would get killed.
Like I'd fucking cm punk fight.

610
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,540
This guy is way better than him.
He really has a background in fighting.

611
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,593
How,
how does that dynamic work for you and 

612
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:08,390
Dana were,
you know,

613
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,090
with something like that that,
that can be seen if somebody is a little

614
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:12,770
triggered,
are a little sensitive,

615
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,680
they might get a little bit like angry 
at you saying something like that.

616
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,250
Dana is the easiest going guy ever with 
that kind of shit.

617
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,290
He doesn't give a fuck.
He looked.

618
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:26,291
Me and him have been friends for like 
almost 20 years.

619
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,370
We've been friends for a long time and 
I've been working for the UFC.

620
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,250
I mean I started working for the old 
company in [inaudible] 97.

621
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,400
I started working for that long ago.
Yeah.

622
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,150
And then the new company,
I started working for them in 2002 and I

623
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:44,400
was friends with Dana before that.
It's just he,

624
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,323
he knows my heart's in the right place,
but he also knows that if I wasn't 

625
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,790
honest nobody would listen to me.
Yeah.

626
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:51,624
That's the thing.
I enjoy watching the fights and 

627
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:58,320
listening to your,
your critical in a fairway with people I

628
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,340
think,
you know.

629
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,390
Yeah.
When you,

630
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,980
when you critique what somebody is 
doing,

631
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,280
it's like if they listened the right way
it's probably going to help them.

632
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,833
Well I definitely don't say things that 
if I don't know what I'm talking about 

633
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,700
and I don't say things that I don't 
mean,

634
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,310
you know,
but if I see something and I've watched,

635
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,340
I mean I've called at least a thousand 
fights.

636
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,320
I don't know how many times or probably 
more.

637
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,223
Yeah.
And I've seen some of the greatest 

638
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:26,470
fights of all time up live in close.
Right?

639
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,960
Right next to the cage.
You know,

640
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,160
I seen a lot of shit.
So if I'm saying something it's probably

641
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:34,080
because it's right.
I mean it.

642
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,550
But if I don't know what I'm talking 
about,

643
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:37,384
like it's one of the good things about 
having Daniel cormier there or dominick 

644
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,533
Cruz,
if there's some aspect of fighting that 

645
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:43,404
maybe I'm not exactly sure about,
I can defer to them and I could say 

646
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,300
like,
wow,

647
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,410
what's so important about getting the 
under hook here?

648
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,483
You know?
And then cormier could go off about 

649
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:52,650
like,
why this?

650
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:54,150
And then you go,
oh,

651
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:55,200
okay,
I get that.

652
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:55,761
Okay,
I see.

653
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:59,550
I like that was a big thing in the fight
with Steve and Daniel Cormier.

654
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,743
Dominick Cruz was explaining how 
important it was that caught me a kept 

655
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,930
pummeling.
He kept shifting positions and pummeling

656
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:07,764
for under hooks and that was one of the 
reasons why I was able to land that big 

657
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:10,914
right hand because he was never static.
He also had to wear something to get in 

658
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:14,790
there too.
Then yeah.

659
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,830
I mean he was writing Steve based face 
and she pays like,

660
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,763
I mean that was such a great match.
Even though obviously it didn't last 

661
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,370
very long,
but I mean he,

662
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,130
he took a few on the chin real hard to 
get in there.

663
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,253
And uh,
for Steve Bay has got to drive him 

664
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:29,490
fucking crazy.

665
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,323
Like she's been tweeting a lot.
Why wouldn't he get a straight rematch 

666
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,993
straight away?
I mean there's even supposedly talk at 

667
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,940
mcgregor getting rematch when he got 
pretty much handled everywhere.

668
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,820
I don't think there's real talk of 
mcgregor getting a rematch.

669
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:42,654
I think the real smart money is on Tony 
Ferguson fighting Khabib next that Dane 

670
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,623
has been saying that I,
I 100 percent believe that Tony 

671
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,673
Ferguson.
I don't think Tony Ferguson should have 

672
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:54,744
ever been stripped.
I think he should still be the interim 

673
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:56,971
champion.
I mean,

674
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,330
the guy fell while he was doing press 
and tore his knee apart.

675
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,493
Six months later it comes back and 
destroys Anthony Pettis and spectacular 

676
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,030
performance.
Fight.

677
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,070
Pettis was great too.
Fuck you.

678
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,700
It was Tony's.
Tony's just a warrior.

679
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:13,050
I mean he's,
he's cardio,

680
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:13,884
never runs out.
He throws weird stuff with everything 

681
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,880
you can throw currently got upset that 
we call them a Weirdo.

682
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,340
Like he's,
I guess he's sensitive.

683
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,263
He apparently got upset.
I said it was a brilliant Weirdo like 

684
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,353
when he was on his way to the cage,
but I meant that 100 percent 

685
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,850
complimentary ankle weights at the weigh
ins,

686
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,390
like I don't even know what I mean.
He uses a wing Chung dummy.

687
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,940
He sets up his,
all of his camp,

688
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,950
his training,
and he sets it up himself.

689
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,823
He puts the mats down.
He builds his own like heavy bag 

690
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,220
hangers.
He puts,

691
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,130
he puts up Chin up bars,
all that shit does it himself.

692
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,993
He's like,
he does construction like it's 

693
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,690
unfamiliar to the average training 
regimen.

694
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,590
Yes.
That's what I'm.

695
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,910
I'm in a complimentary way.
I'm a huge fan of that guy.

696
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,751
I am too.
I thought.

697
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:57,584
I think he's awesome.
I also think that he is the toughest 

698
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:03,490
test for Khabib because of his cardio 
and because of its versatility,

699
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,680
because he could fight really well off 
his back when he submitted Kevin Lee off

700
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,960
his back to win the title.

701
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,243
He's got a fantastic darce choke and his
ability to hold guys in his guard and 

702
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:17,650
recover if he gets clipped.
I mean he's.

703
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,930
He's the most dangerous guy.
Lightweight.

704
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,250
For Khabib.
I think,

705
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,100
in my opinion,
yeah,

706
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,670
he just never gets fucking tired.
It doesn't even make sense.

707
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,950
And Eddie,
Eddie trains them.

708
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:30,720
He's one of Eddie's students.
Eddie says he's never seen anything like

709
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:30,971
it.
He said,

710
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:33,580
this guy work out six hours a day,
full clip,

711
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,653
everybody else's exhausted.
He keeps going there doing sprints up 

712
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:38,230
the hill,
20 laps.

713
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,100
Everybody keeps going.
He's just.

714
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,080
Cardio is off the charts.
I wonder if that's a Mexican thing too.

715
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,190
I think there's a lot of Mexicans that 
have amazing cardio,

716
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,660
right?
I don't know what it is,

717
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:52,360
man.
I mean if it's a running thing for sure,

718
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,140
but I mean if you go back to Julio,
Cesar Chavez,

719
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,230
Aka baby,
I think,

720
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,970
I mean Gilbert Belinda said that wants 
to that.

721
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,803
It's a Mexican thing.
It's cardio because Gilbert's always 

722
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,174
been known for his crazy cardio.
I really wonder if there's like certain 

723
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:07,414
ethnicities that have an advantage or at
least a better starting point and then 

724
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:13,890
it's all hard work from there.
Yeah.

725
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,060
That must.
Maybe there's some genetic thing you can

726
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,970
prove and the way that blood holds on to
Diego Sanchez.

727
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:20,950
He's another one.
You go insane cardio.

728
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,240
Yeah,
I mean,

729
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,040
I don't know.
I mean it's a,

730
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,430
it's a,
it's a fun thing to think about.

731
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,320
I mean,
you,

732
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,120
you go,
like,

733
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,350
you go to back to boxing in particular.
I mean,

734
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,470
how many great boxers had fantastic 
cardio from Mexico,

735
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,690
you know,
Chavez in particular,

736
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:38,770
Julio,
Cesar Chavez,

737
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,940
which is where guys down the volume of 
his punching.

738
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,930
It was just never stopped.
Just constantly on.

739
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,470
You constantly moving forward,
bobbing and weaving and throwing shots.

740
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:50,140
And sometimes as an athlete,
like if you're a boxer,

741
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:50,760
you'd have to,

742
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,593
even if you didn't have that,
you'd have to dig deep and pretend you 

743
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:55,410
had that,
you know what I mean?

744
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:56,880
Because then it starts wearing another 
guy.

745
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,580
Like,
this guy's never stop.

746
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,210
You know,
like I had a,

747
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,044
uh,
I had a situation once I was super 

748
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,320
winded,
I was really tired in a,

749
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,480
in a heat surfing in Tahiti and uh,
this,

750
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,090
this heat ended up sort of being like a 
world title heat for me.

751
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,103
And um,
I was losing with like two minutes ago 

752
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:16,794
and I ended up in this paddle battle 
against a guy and he's a good paddler 

753
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:23,100
and pretty fit guy and we're like head 
to head.

754
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:23,934
And what happens,
we,

755
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,833
whoever gets back out first deemed by 
the judges gets priority over the next 

756
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:28,854
wave.
They can have whatever the way they 

757
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,180
want.
And with two minutes,

758
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,220
three minutes left and a heat surfing,
there's,

759
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,530
that's not a lot of time to get a wave 
if uh,

760
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,603
if the wave comes,
you got to be the guy that has priority 

761
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:40,100
for it and we're.
And

762
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,730
I could feel him just for half a second 
kind of lit up when his paddle like,

763
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:44,930
okay,
I'm getting ahead on this guy.

764
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:47,120
And as soon as he did I paddle harder.
And I was like,

765
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:47,631
I,
you know,

766
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,930
to show him.
Like I got more and he gave up and I got

767
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:51,770
it.
And then I got,

768
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,640
then I needed like a score out of 10 
points and I needed like a nine.

769
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,430
I got like a nine point four with 30 
seconds ago or something.

770
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,990
It was just.
But it was,

771
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,000
I didn't have that in me,
like physically I was like,

772
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,100
I don't want to quit too,
you know,

773
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,020
but I was like,
I got a poker face,

774
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,550
this guy,
I think I got more,

775
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:08,270
you know,
and I,

776
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,890
I really didn't.
It was just that choice.

777
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:10,724
Like I don't care.
I'm going to get out there with the 

778
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:13,550
lungs burning and I'll feel bad for 30 
seconds,

779
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,450
whatever,
you know.

780
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,020
But sometimes I would imagine boxers,
pro tribe or may guys for sure.

781
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,810
Sometimes you can't bluff that,
but sometimes you can't bluff it.

782
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,883
But yeah,
for sure it does come up where there's 

783
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:29,990
an edge one way or the other.
That's a big thing with Ferguson,

784
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:31,860
that pressure that he puts on guys.
Yeah.

785
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:33,710
He just never gets slow.
You know,

786
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,080
if you watched the Gustafson,
a Jon Jones fight to John late,

787
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:40,610
that fight,
did you know?

788
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:41,444
There could've been some doubt.
And so people who winning that fight or 

789
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,483
it close fight,
but look like John just started pouring 

790
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:47,140
it.
He was three.

791
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,570
Yup.
Strikes in the last couple rounds.

792
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah.
The last rounds one him that fight.

793
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,840
And by all accounts,
John Wasn't in shape by all accounts.

794
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,674
John Really didn't train for that fight 
and didn't take Gustafson seriously and 

795
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,004
kind of half assed his training camp and
still pulled it off in the championship 

796
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:04,760
rounds.

797
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,370
That guy's livable and they're going to 
rematch.

798
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,560
That's right.
Yeah.

799
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,730
That's anyway.
Yup.

800
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,650
The December card,
it's January,

801
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,800
New Year's Eve,
you know,

802
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,910
basically I think it's the December 29,
29 things.

803
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,983
Fantastic fight.
And because I think Gustafson's way 

804
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:20,564
better now.
You see when Gustafson knocked out 

805
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:22,874
globally to share.
I mean he just looked like there was 

806
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,550
like a video game.
Combinational.

807
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,860
Yeah.
So I think that fight is a,

808
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:31,280
that's going to be one for the ages.
And then for John,

809
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,090
his comeback fight for Gustafson to be 
the rematch he's asking for forever.

810
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,650
And it will be for the light heavyweight
title.

811
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,260
They're going to strip cormier.
Are they going to fight heavyweight in?

812
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,350
Yeah,
I mean he's gonna.

813
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,450
He's fighting Derrick Lewis in December 
and weird flight.

814
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,600
Well he's number two.
I mean if you look at the rankings,

815
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:51,434
it's not.
If you look at Derrick Lewis is 

816
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,300
obviously unorthodox,
but he was,

817
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,050
he was just getting mauled in that last 
flight.

818
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,440
He doesn't matter when you go in,
I guess in Madden when you get that last

819
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:05,441
punch and the power that he has with his
finger,

820
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:07,490
you know,
why am I,

821
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,820
why am I even talking about this?
But I'm just a fan.

822
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,930
He really was the number two contender 
headed into that fight and then wins.

823
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,030
I think that guy was the dark horse,
that division.

824
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,150
So for him to knock off Alexander like 
that,

825
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,260
that's a jet was a giant knockout and to
get his ass kicked for three rounds.

826
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,140
Respect to to Alexander though.
Yeah,

827
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:30,170
for,
for staying in the pocket.

828
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,320
Fighting out with 30 seconds to go when 
he clearly winning Netflix.

829
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,190
Well,
he got hurt.

830
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,810
He got hurt a couple of times in that 
fight.

831
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,411
Did he just.
Yeah.

832
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:37,244
Yeah.
There was one time where he lost his 

833
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,830
mouth piece and he tried to give it to 
Derek.

834
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,420
Yeah,
that's right.

835
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,890
I think he was on Queer Street.
I didn't.

836
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,830
I don't think he knew what the fuck was 
going on because Derek hits so hard.

837
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,180
He,
if you don't get knocked out,

838
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:48,990
you're probably like,
oh,

839
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,370
even a glancing blow.
Right.

840
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,061
Hey,
you probably like,

841
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:51,894
what in the fuck me thinking about the 
way he knocked out Travis Brown when he 

842
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,063
knocked out Gonzaga and Derek would be 
even better if he didn't have a bad 

843
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,040
back.
Derek's got a fucked up back.

844
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,680
So why does he want it?
That's three fights in six months.

845
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:06,390
Or what was the last flight within 
Ghana?

846
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,530
Um,
well he fought in Ghana and that was the

847
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:12,270
fight where it was just like,
what the fuck?

848
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,104
That was barely a fight.
It was like five punches thrown the 

849
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,840
entire as a fan watching it.
I felt like c one against in Ghana.

850
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,290
Um,
yeah.

851
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,200
Yeah.
But as a fan,

852
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,043
I.
Did you feel like that was more on in 

853
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,780
Ghana than it was on Derek?
Yeah,

854
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:29,460
I don't know.
I always felt that way.

855
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,473
Well,
in Ghana who didn't do anything and 

856
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,300
Derek one,
you know,

857
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,583
he didn't win by much,
but I mean he was basically waiting for 

858
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:37,860
in Ghana,
you know,

859
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:41,490
you gotta be careful with in Ghana 
because in Ghana punches so fucking hard

860
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,680
but steep a fuck.
That dude's head up.

861
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,770
He really did steep ages.
Fucked his head up.

862
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,123
He,
he.

863
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,973
Yeah.
That was even talking about in Ghana 

864
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,890
anymore.
That's what's weird in Ghana.

865
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:54,360
Before the steep a fight,
everybody's like,

866
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:55,980
this is the second common cited for that
thing.

867
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:56,814
Oh my God.
When he knocked Alistair overeem into 

868
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:00,120
another dimension,
everybody was like,

869
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,910
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

870
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,350
That was,
that was like,

871
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,100
that looked like a career ending.
Punch.

872
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,930
Her Dad was like a break your neck with 
this.

873
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,980
Meanwhile overeem ready to fight again.
Didn't he fight again after that?

874
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,990
Against Curtis Blades.
I feel like you did.

875
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,213
I feel like he fought curtis please 
after that and lost and got stopped in 

876
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,140
that fight too.
Yeah,

877
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:23,280
I mean,
look in Ghana hits Falk in hard,

878
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,650
harder than anybody has ever fought.
I mean,

879
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:26,484
he's not.
When he's mouth breathing in the fifth 

880
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:28,464
round,
it didn't matter because he gassed 

881
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:33,140
himself out in the first and he really 
wasn't prepared for a full game.

882
00:37:33,141 --> 00:37:34,470
You really didn't think was going gonna 
go to the ground.

883
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:35,390
From what I heard.
Yeah.

884
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,010
I thought I'd catch this guy.
That's what I thought.

885
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,030
He.
He thought he hit so hard that steep.

886
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:41,864
It was going to be in front of him.
He's going to hit Steve Bay's going to 

887
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:44,780
be the heavyweight champ I was going to 
ask you.

888
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,890
Do you,
do you have your absolute dream job?

889
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,000
But I mean you do a few things,
but like you,

890
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:54,100
you get to talk UFC.
You're a black belt under Eddie,

891
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,613
right?
Yeah.

892
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,483
And so like you've kind of found the 
perfect job for yourself because you 

893
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:01,650
just can't tell when you're talking 
about.

894
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:03,540
You just love it so much.
Like I love surfing.

895
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,040
I just,
I live,

896
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:05,874
eat and breathe surf everyday I wake up 
and the first thing I do is look at 

897
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,930
where's the waves in the world.
Whereas when you retire,

898
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:11,750
you'll do commentary.
Uh,

899
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,990
maybe a little bit.
Yeah,

900
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,550
maybe a little bit.
But I don't want to,

901
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,700
I don't really want a job whenever you 
die.

902
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,510
You know,
I've been,

903
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,343
I've been,
I've been on a pro tour pretty much 

904
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:25,170
since I was 19 and 46.
I took about three years off,

905
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:26,850
but I would still compete a little bit 
those years.

906
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,441
What are the,
what?

907
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:31,470
It's the high end of the age limit in 
terms of like where does that can really

908
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:32,400
compete?
Like right now,

909
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,080
no one's ever been my age on tour.
Yeah,

910
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,040
no,
I think the

911
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,800
next oldest grand towards 38 and he's 
retiring this year.

912
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,930
Wow.
When I've gone on tour,

913
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,630
the oldest guy was 28 years old.
Holy Shit.

914
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,660
It was like there was a real,
you know,

915
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,640
that I would say in the eighties there 
wasn't like,

916
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,140
it didn't look like you could make some 
money and if you were a top five guy but

917
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:55,270
it didn't look like you could have like 
this crazy career.

918
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:56,104
So guys weren't thinking longevity.
They're like let's go have a freaking 

919
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:00,070
good time.
Travel around the world and get paid for

920
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:00,904
it for a few years and then we'll figure
out a job after or maybe we'll have 

921
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:04,330
enough money to kind of live real 
humbly.

922
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,530
What is the difference between how you 
prepare and other guys?

923
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:11,050
Is that your diet strength and 
conditioning?

924
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:11,884
Like what is it?
I don't overexert myself very much so 

925
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,094
my,
my training aside from surfing isn't a 

926
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:18,004
lot.

927
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,423
I retain.
I feel like I retain enough strength to 

928
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,850
be good at what I need to.
So to find.

929
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,530
Burn yourself out.
I don't burn myself out,

930
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,393
you know,
cause like the oldest people in the 

931
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,640
world weren't athletes and they're kind 
of people who didn't burn themselves out

932
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:34,474
too much.
So I,

933
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,200
my theory on longevity is like don't 
overdo it.

934
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,410
I don't need to necessarily be 
overtrained for what I do.

935
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,660
A lot of the skill.
A lot of the,

936
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,900
the winning that I do competitively is 
from a skill.

937
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,040
It's not so much from being super strong
having crazy cardio.

938
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,353
It's making a choice about which wave,
how I'm gonna approach and ride that 

939
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:55,954
wave.
And I have to get two scores every 30 

940
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:00,100
minutes when they compete.
So it's like I got this 30 minute window

941
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:03,100
I need to be ready for.
I don't need to be like in crazy,

942
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,240
crazy shape [inaudible].

943
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,520
So what is it that held other guys back 
in the past?

944
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,413
I think there's a number of factors.
I think you have to naturally be really 

945
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:13,300
competitive.
Like in your,

946
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,700
when you were born in your home,
somehow you had to,

947
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,030
maybe you needed something to prove.
You know,

948
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,870
I,
I was Kinda like,

949
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,513
you know,
growing up I started of back at it and 

950
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:23,554
kind of laugh.
Like I maybe I couldn't get the girl I 

951
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:27,370
liked because she liked an older guy or 
you know,

952
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:28,204
I didn't have,
we didn't really have any money in my 

953
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:30,424
family so I wanted to make some money.
I had an older brother who kind of 

954
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,573
picked on me,
but I hung out with him and played 

955
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:36,910
football with his friends that were all 
three years older than me.

956
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,170
So I had to be strong,
you know,

957
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,370
I had to be tough and fast.

958
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,770
I had to be smart.
That's the case with a lot of guys,

959
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:43,160
older brothers,
you know,

960
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,103
brothers that they couldn't really 
compete with them like this 

961
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:46,474
motherfucker.
And so every night we would just eat 

962
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,360
away at the end.
I think it,

963
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,760
I think it did and there was always 
that,

964
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,890
you know,
my brother and I have,

965
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,823
I think we have a pretty good 
relationship now and I don't think he 

966
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:56,644
would disagree with me that we kind of 
didn't get along for 20 years or more 

967
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,880
resort hate each other a long time.
But you know,

968
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,060
from the time we were teenagers we kind 
of grew apart,

969
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,433
you know,
I,

970
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,810
I sorta started doing real well 
competing on the world stage and he sort

971
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:15,520
of stagnated and we just,
you know,

972
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,520
people and families have different 
dynamics,

973
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,230
you know,
each child has a different dynamic,

974
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:22,450
whether the first,
I'm in the middle of three,

975
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,670
all boys are younger.

976
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,380
Brother was three or six years younger 
than me,

977
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:28,510
so he was kind of out of the loop when 
we were teenagers.

978
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:31,540
He still a little kid so we,
we're really competing with him.

979
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,880
But he saw us competing against each 
other.

980
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,733
And maybe a few ways and it kind of 
turned him off to surfing so he didn't 

981
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:43,790
start surfing until he was a teenager 
and when he did he wrote long boards and

982
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,180
we're all,
we're both short boarders like you know,

983
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,430
more competition kind of guys.
And He loved kind of the old throwback,

984
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:55,280
the sixties and seventies surfers on 
long boards or on single fins,

985
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,114
which is not a modern board at all.
And why would someone choose one or the 

986
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:02,300
other?
Longboards are short word.

987
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:03,131
Yeah,
it's a,

988
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:03,964
it's a real different skill.
Longboards are kind of easier to just 

989
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,550
get up and ride a wave.

990
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,180
But the skill you have on a long board 
is more.

991
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,930
It's more ballet than it is a gym or 
something,

992
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,940
you know,
it's not like big maneuvers.

993
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,840
It's more like gliding on the wave,
looking like you're not trying hard.

994
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,010
It's,
it's more of a,

995
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,920
a dance if you will.
Then it is like a,

996
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,420
some kind of an athletic skill and short
boarding is just,

997
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,523
you know,
you're going for aerials and lots of 

998
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:32,984
different sort of fast maneuvers.
Really riding in the pocket of the wave 

999
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,973
as long boarding,
you're looking for a different kind of 

1000
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,003
you.
You write a different kind of way of 

1001
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,360
altogether.
You really don't.

1002
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,463
Most of the waves we ride for modern 
shortboarding and competition aren't 

1003
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:46,724
waves.
You would ride along board because 

1004
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:48,224
they're too hollowed there too quick and
fast and you can't fit a board in the 

1005
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,154
same way.
So your brother just kinda took it up 

1006
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,760
more for the fun of it and the aesthetic
of it.

1007
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,893
He literally was at the beach one day,
his story and he was about 14 or 15 and 

1008
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,350
we always try to get them to surf and 
when he was about eight or 10,

1009
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:04,184
I took him surfing one day at our local,
a break at Sebastian in Florida and I 

1010
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:10,100
pushed him on this wave and he.
He ate.

1011
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:11,150
It was underwater.
Long time.

1012
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:13,230
It kind of freaked them out.
Not a long time,

1013
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,340
a long time for an eight year old,
like maybe 10 seconds or eight seconds.

1014
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:17,174
You know when you're out of breath,
a little freaky like you don't know 

1015
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:20,204
which way's up.
And he kind of quit surfing and then 

1016
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,530
when he was like 14 or 15 years at the 
beach and this guy,

1017
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,364
he,
he really respected this kind of older 

1018
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:28,071
guys.
Like,

1019
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,270
Hey,
I'm going to run somewhere.

1020
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:32,570
We watched my board,
he had a longboard and he said,

1021
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:33,240
we watched my board.

1022
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,940
And Steven said,
oh yeah,

1023
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:36,020
watch it.
And the guy said,

1024
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:36,854
or you can go use it if you want.
And you paddle out and caught a few 

1025
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:39,800
waves.
And he just sort of fell in love with at

1026
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,634
minute with surfing.
And it was something unique for him 

1027
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,490
because we didn't long board.
So it was like,

1028
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,170
it was that beach life and thing we 
love,

1029
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:49,040
but it was different,
you know?

1030
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,750
Right.
He got his own thing.

1031
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1032
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,820
And then me and my brother,
we,

1033
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,790
you know,
I got more and more into competition and

1034
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,220
getting sponsored and stuff and he sort 
of,

1035
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,873
he,
he just kinda started fading out of 

1036
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:03,760
doing competition fulltime and stuff.
And,

1037
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,753
and,
uh,

1038
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,690
and uh,
then when I was a teenager,

1039
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,120
when I was in of a freshman in high 
school,

1040
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,163
this guy moved into town,
a kid named drew and he had sort of got 

1041
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:16,694
kicked out of a couple of schools 
elsewhere and I got himself into some 

1042
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:22,310
trouble and when he came he came over to
the beach.

1043
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,143
He was kind of in these inland schools,
but he was good at football and go to 

1044
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:28,310
baseball.
He was kind of a really good athlete.

1045
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,063
Uh,
he became the quarterback on a football 

1046
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:33,300
team.
He was a baseball player,

1047
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,860
all this kind of stuff.
So he was,

1048
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,720
he was a total jock,
not a surfer at all.

1049
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,340
And somehow he and I became best buddies
and you know,

1050
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,820
I liked,
I liked all the sports.

1051
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:43,500
I grew up playing football,
basketball,

1052
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:45,090
baseball,
a little bit tennis.

1053
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:46,940
Um,
and,

1054
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,843
and he and I ultimately where we got to 
is he sort of became my big brother 

1055
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,463
competitively and we used to battle and 
it didn't matter whose feelings got 

1056
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:56,190
hurt,
you know,

1057
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:01,250
like we competed at absolutely 
everything from horseshoes to bowling to

1058
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,303
pull on my birthday.
Every year on my birthday we made it a 

1059
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:07,560
pack to where we'd go play every kind of
game we could possibly.

1060
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,540
And we keep a tally of who won wide.
It was many,

1061
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,501
it was Putt,
Putt,

1062
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:12,480
golf,
it was go carts,

1063
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,200
it was basketball,
it was shuffleboard,

1064
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,450
it was like literally everything air,
you know,

1065
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,430
everything we could think of.
And uh,

1066
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,150
we just keep a tally and we,
we used to be in the millions of dollars

1067
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,040
real well.
Yeah,

1068
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,140
of course.
So,

1069
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,123
you know,
at some point somebody owed somebody a 

1070
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:32,570
hundreds of millions of dollars,
but you never paid no.

1071
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,750
Of course when it came down to like 
actual money,

1072
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,530
then it was like five bucks.
And at one point he,

1073
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,723
he was uh,
he got really into horse shoes and he 

1074
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:45,870
called me out one day and he's like,
meet me at the beach.

1075
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,310
We're gonna play some horseshoes.
I'm like,

1076
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,590
all right,
bye bye.

1077
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,613
I'm like,
but I'm not playing you unless we're 

1078
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,930
getting some money,
some real money.

1079
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:52,861
And he's like,
all right,

1080
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:53,694
bring some money.

1081
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,940
And at the end of the day,
he ended up owing me about 160 bucks.

1082
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,490
He's like,
you fucking tell my wife I owe you,

1083
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,713
I'll fucking kill you now.
Never pay you because I don't have the 

1084
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,390
money.
I can't pay you that.

1085
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:05,224
And he was like,
so I'll pay you like 20 bucks here and 

1086
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:08,380
there as we go.
But drew used to,

1087
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,170
he beat me at everything.
He was better than me.

1088
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:11,070
Uh,
basically everything.

1089
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,503
And so it was like that.
A pingpong too on my 18th birthday that 

1090
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,113
I like to call it the night upsets 
because it was a night that Mike Tyson 

1091
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:24,480
last the buster douglas and it was,
it was,

1092
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,190
uh,
the night of February 10th.

1093
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:28,890
My birthday's in the limit on the 11th,
but they were in Tokyo.

1094
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:29,724
So they were on the 11th fighting.
Tyson last drew shows up in my house 

1095
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:36,930
with the ping pong table and he says 
that it was like my birthday gifts.

1096
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:38,430
All my friends want me to ping pong 
table.

1097
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,323
My mom,
my three buddies and drew beat me 17 

1098
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:44,640
straight games in a row.
And I started crying.

1099
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,583
I think he ended up letting me finally 
win the last game so we could go to bed 

1100
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,950
at two in the morning and man,
I've never been.

1101
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:56,843
I've really honestly never been so 
frustrated and just outright beaten by 

1102
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:00,414
somebody at anything and he just owned.
I just knew he owned me and he would 

1103
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:05,070
just tell me where he's going to hit the
ball on the table and beat me.

1104
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:09,240
Ping Pong is a serious skill.
It's a really good at it.

1105
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,373
Oh,
follow.

1106
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,040
You should go on Pol affinity on 
instagram and watch these things.

1107
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,420
These guys do.
It's out of hand.

1108
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,710
I'm scared.
Yeah.

1109
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,780
Ping Pong is one of those games where I 
was like,

1110
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,690
if I ever got into that,
I think it would eat your life.

1111
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,530
It seems like we used to stay up the 
night and you know,

1112
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,510
we sucked and we thought we were pretty 
good.

1113
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,250
You know,
we'd,

1114
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,083
we'd,
uh,

1115
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,070
use soap and

1116
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,110
water to make our or paddles a little 
stickier.

1117
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:33,944
You know,
we thought we had all this pain and 

1118
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,490
stuff.
The guys are playing three way.

1119
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,383
That is crazy.
I mean that's another kind of way you 

1120
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:45,361
like it's a street and they're just 
smashing the ball and it,

1121
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:53,790
this is crazy and low behind the back.
And is there money in Ping Pong?

1122
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,240
I don't,
I,

1123
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,180
I think there are,
you know,

1124
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,720
in China or something.
Right?

1125
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,160
I don't think in the states there really
is,

1126
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,340
but that's the same thing with pool now,
but I don't know.

1127
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:05,620
I don't see some white guy going to 
China and beaten all those guys.

1128
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,540
You see these guys are masters.
They don't move,

1129
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,110
you know,
they just,

1130
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,320
they're the risk moves it,
there's no dancing,

1131
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,310
you know?
Yeah.

1132
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:14,710
It seems like one of those sports where 
there's just,

1133
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,143
there's a whole,
there's a whole world out there that 

1134
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:21,870
you're not aware of of like elite killer
ping pong players.

1135
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,620
Like most people aren't even thinking 
about it.

1136
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,140
Yeah,
it's funny.

1137
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,190
We could talk about ping pong and it's 
like everyone can kind of join in.

1138
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,130
Like if I ever talk about fighting 
people are shut your ass man.

1139
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,040
You stay in your lane,
but you know,

1140
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,000
it's just like,
I'm a fan of pink pong too.

1141
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,953
I'll talk about ping pong.
That's a funny thing that stay in your 

1142
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:40,910
lane thing like,
you know,

1143
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,640
have to have an opinion on things.
Yeah.

1144
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,890
Yeah.
So then why can we vote?

1145
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,813
You know,
about somebody who's going to handle 

1146
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:48,310
everything.
Why are we allowed to.

1147
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,323
Can we only just vote be about something
that has to do with surfing or fighting 

1148
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,330
is a weird one.
Like people want you have for,

1149
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,970
for some people,
like you have to know how to fight to be

1150
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:59,400
able to talk about fighting.
Yeah,

1151
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,240
they take it real serious about that.

1152
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,730
Like you hear that about journalists,
like look at this fucking guy.

1153
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:05,700
Probably never trained in Dana's life.
You know,

1154
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,543
they look at a guy and he's fat or tiny 
or whatever and they just don't want to 

1155
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,520
listen to anything that they say.
But meanwhile they could be an expert.

1156
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,320
Yeah,
I mean fight Roy Nelson.

1157
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,693
Yeah.
Okay.

1158
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,653
Go,
have fun.

1159
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,390
Have Fun with that one.
But it's a,

1160
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,243
it's.
I was a kid I trained with Don the 

1161
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,170
Dragon Wilson.
Oh,

1162
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,130
did you really?
I did for about a year.

1163
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,890
I got a chance to spar him once.
Did you.

1164
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,800
It was awesome.
Yeah,

1165
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,050
it was.
So to me it was like,

1166
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,030
I'm such a fan of that guy.
He was totally ambidextrous Whitney.

1167
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,720
Oh yeah.
He could fight any style and he,

1168
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:37,900
I mean he also had that weird,
a sideways stance where,

1169
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:40,090
you know,
he had like kickboxing skills,

1170
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:41,890
boxing skills,
more skills,

1171
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,810
but he also had like a traditional 
karate and Kung Fu background.

1172
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:47,530
So we'd stand sideways on you and you 
didn't know what was coming at you then,

1173
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:48,190
right?
Yeah.

1174
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,023
Now he was awesome.
And I remember when he fought Dennis 

1175
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,010
Alexio,
Dennis,

1176
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,843
Alexia,
he moved to the west side of Oahu and 

1177
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,580
that was like all the news back and then
I,

1178
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,573
and he fucked Alexio up with leg kicks.
He was like one of the first guys that 

1179
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:03,723
punished Alexia with leg kicks.
He did a thing on youtube about defense 

1180
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,560
defense for self defense for women.
And they were saying like,

1181
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,710
you're,
it was part of this group.

1182
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:13,240
And the,
they talked about like,

1183
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,770
you know,
if you're gonna,

1184
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:14,860
teach a woman something,
kick,

1185
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,110
kick the leg because that's the biggest 
target,

1186
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:20,650
you know,
bad advice before Jujitsu.

1187
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,760
People kick the balls,
but your legs carry you around.

1188
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,110
I mean,
that's the thing about a woman.

1189
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:27,800
If a woman weighs 135 pounds,

1190
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,040
she's walking around with 135 pounds 
carrying it.

1191
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:31,930
It's like,
how,

1192
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,370
uh,
how long could you walk on your hands?

1193
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,453
Yeah,
I mean I heard that brock lesnar could 

1194
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:38,070
walk into his hands like a mile,
which is kind of crazy.

1195
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,500
Yeah.
Really?

1196
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,800
He's a freak,
like a legitimate free.

1197
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,670
He walks in his hands all around the 
gym.

1198
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,250
Yeah.
He wanted to do a video,

1199
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,080
like walking up the stairs.
I had a buddy,

1200
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:51,050
a surf buddy from.
I'm from Santa Cruz.

1201
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:51,884
He unfortunately passed away gun.
He and Barney a good friend of all of 

1202
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:55,604
ours and he used to do these surf video 
clips and he would walk downstairs and 

1203
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:00,404
then walk upstairs and he did all.
He could literally just walk anywhere 

1204
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:04,100
and his hand.
It was so cool to see.

1205
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,170
Well,
I mean,

1206
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,330
I guess you would build it.
It's all about how often you use it,

1207
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:08,600
right?

1208
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,480
You use your legs constantly.
Don't use your arms constantly,

1209
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:14,420
but if you did and you built up over 
years of time,

1210
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:17,390
I would imagine.
I mean there's obviously the shipping is

1211
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:18,380
quick to,
you know,

1212
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,810
I mean I started doing hand actually 
right before I broke my foot.

1213
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,360
I started when I was a kid.
I used to be able to pretty much walk in

1214
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,194
and listen on my hands.
Like when you walk on your hands while 

1215
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:27,250
your foot was broken?
Uh,

1216
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,120
no,
but that week I was like,

1217
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,013
you know what?
When I was a kid I could walk for 

1218
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:32,720
minutes at a time.
My hands,

1219
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,850
I'm going to get back into that.
So I started training that week.

1220
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:37,610
Like I just started doing handstands 
everyday with my friend's daughter.

1221
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:38,444
You broke your foot right?
The week I broke my leg for the two 

1222
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:40,694
weeks before I broke my foot and I 
started like quickly I could feel the 

1223
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,560
skill coming back,
you know,

1224
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,083
I mean I probably should have kept with 
it because then I could have walked 

1225
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,760
around for a while and kept my foot 
high.

1226
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,080
But uh,
no,

1227
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:51,914
but I mean,
my point is that like pretty quickly 

1228
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:54,680
your body starts to attune to that 
thing.

1229
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:57,110
Like I used to do pushups on the back of
my wrist,

1230
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,600
this buddy of mine who was into martial 
arts,

1231
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:00,980
he's like,
do risk pushups.

1232
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:01,814
And what's the benefit of the.
He was just saying to strengthen your 

1233
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:04,430
risks.
I don't know.

1234
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,264
He used to do it,
but the first time I did it it really 

1235
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:07,754
hurt my wrists.
And then after about a week of doing it 

1236
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:12,380
didn't hurt my wrists anymore.
Your body just kind of adjust?

1237
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:13,300
Definitely.
Yeah.

1238
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,013
But I dunno,
I think I'm going to start doing 

1239
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:20,390
handstands and doing that.
The Burmese a volleyball thing.

1240
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,630
How long did it take?
I mean,

1241
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:25,250
what were you on crutches or you want a 
wheelchair?

1242
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:28,880
Like how long did it take before you 
could actually walk a broken foot?

1243
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,180
While I was walking a little too soon.
Oh yeah.

1244
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,860
How long I didn't.
I didn't break it,

1245
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,390
but I didn't displace the bones any.
But I mean I actually wrote,

1246
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,460
I wrote a couple of ways,
like six weeks later.

1247
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,510
No.
Yeah,

1248
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,493
I probably would you do that?
Well because we built this wave of like 

1249
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,510
a up in your fresno.
We built a manmade wave and um,

1250
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:52,130
are those a good way to learn?
Yeah.

1251
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,091
Well,
yeah,

1252
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:53,924
they can be.
I mean it depends on how long the wave 

1253
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:58,130
lasts and what size wave and how fast 
and all that kind of thing,

1254
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,760
but our way,
it's pretty easy to learn on,

1255
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,260
but our wave lasts on the low speed for 
a beginner.

1256
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:06,080
It lasts over a minute long.
That would seem to me that,

1257
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:09,560
that would be a great way to like just 
get your feet wet.

1258
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,573
Yeah,
no,

1259
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,080
you should come up.
Is that it right there?

1260
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:12,914
Yeah,
but that's not the low side at least 

1261
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,720
what's like the,
uh,

1262
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,670
as the high setting.
Yeah.

1263
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,260
This was.
And this was actually.

1264
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,423
Where is that like,
is that a like 40 minutes south of 

1265
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:22,340
Fresno area?
Yeah,

1266
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,140
it's a big.
It used to be a ski like,

1267
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,730
so it's long narrow lake.
Oh Wow.

1268
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,980
That is crazy.
Yeah,

1269
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,200
that's all manmade.
This is manmade.

1270
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,410
That's so weird.
This isn't the newest version of it.

1271
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,620
If you were to google,
if you were to search,

1272
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:38,460
like,
um,

1273
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,250
uh,
there was a contest called,

1274
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,543
we had a couple of contests.
We had one called the surf ranch pro 

1275
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,260
about six weeks ago and that's,
we changed the waves since then and uh,

1276
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,650
we remodeled that we had to rebuild it,
but,

1277
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,980
um,
anyways,

1278
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:55,883
the reason I surfed was because we were 
having the first competition at this 

1279
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,590
wave and I wanted to ride the first way 
like,

1280
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,190
oh,
I didn't want get to compete.

1281
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,053
I just like,
symbolically I wanted to ride the wave 

1282
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:07,290
at the thing.
So how does this work?

1283
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,250
What's making that wave?
This is a coil,

1284
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,253
a wave foil,
like a in the back it looks sometimes 

1285
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,450
you'll see in the back behind the wave,
not there,

1286
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:17,910
but to the left side more you would see 
this thing.

1287
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:18,744
It's a,
it's basically a super inefficient boat 

1288
00:54:20,861 --> 00:54:21,694
hole and it pushes through the water.
And so it's pushing water instead of 

1289
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:26,070
planning on the water.
Like you would want a boat too.

1290
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,390
So it's pushing all the water sideways 
and it's just this foil shape.

1291
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:34,470
It's almost like the shape of a finn or 
a wing straight up and down in the water

1292
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,510
is that blue thing in the back and it 
rides.

1293
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:41,540
It's like a rollercoaster and uh,
it gets pulled on a pulley system with a

1294
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,470
4,000
horsepower engine.

1295
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,370
There's two of them actually wanted to 
go either direction.

1296
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,800
So you see it's now they've got their 
back to the wave when they're riding,

1297
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,680
but the first few ways they showed me 
this is Stephanie Gilmore.

1298
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:55,180
She's like six time world champ.
Um,

1299
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,470
this is a,
that's me obviously.

1300
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,620
And this was just about six weeks ago in
September.

1301
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,400
And um,
so yeah,

1302
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:06,234
I mean,
I,

1303
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,133
I designed the technology with the 
scientist and then design the actual 

1304
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,340
brief bottom or concrete bottom that,
that makes the wave break.

1305
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,233
Yeah.
Because this seems way more advanced 

1306
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:17,700
than the ones that I've seen.
Yeah.

1307
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:19,050
This is,
it's a really advanced way.

1308
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,310
It's actually longer than it needs to 
be.

1309
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:21,144
Also [inaudible] at a fast speed.
The waste to like 45 seconds and your 

1310
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:26,750
legs are fried.
This is Philippe Toledo,

1311
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,430
who's number two in the world right now.
He's unbelievable.

1312
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,540
That's crazy fast.

1313
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,970
Great Surfer.
Where's he from?

1314
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,240
Brazil.
A lot of surfers come from Brazil.

1315
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,710
All the new good guys are from Brazil.
It's like the flight or fight game,

1316
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:41,544
you know,
this is a Gabriel Medina guy's 

1317
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:44,730
incredible.
He's a,

1318
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,260
he's unbelievable.
Whoa.

1319
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,600
And he's a fucking balanced.
That's,

1320
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,160
that's probably shove it.
Yeah.

1321
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:54,030
Um,
and I think that was a corrupt flip.

1322
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:58,230
He did super high tech moves,
but he.

1323
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,720
Gabriel Medina is one time world champ 
from few years ago,

1324
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:03,050
but I thought he was,
you know,

1325
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:03,893
I thought he was just going to win year 
after year after year after his first 

1326
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:06,624
title.
I don't know if it got complacent or 

1327
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,250
what happened and he and I aren't super 
just like,

1328
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:14,640
how do they judge like it's,
it's a subjective.

1329
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,520
Yeah.
Um,

1330
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,420
that's the probably the tough thing for 
our sport,

1331
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:20,340
but I mean gymnastics is subjective.
Um,

1332
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,510
ice skating,
you know,

1333
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,020
that kind of thing.

1334
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,690
So it's not too different to me.
It's not too dissimilar to that.

1335
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:26,740
So,
you know,

1336
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:29,500
the judges are all good surfers,
relatively good surfers.

1337
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,120
Maybe not exposed,
but you know,

1338
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:36,121
guys who know what is possible.
On a wave and I'm there,

1339
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:38,740
it's pretty easy for them to compare 
apples to oranges,

1340
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:41,050
a different person skills over the other
one.

1341
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,140
Um,
but it would be interesting in UFC,

1342
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:44,760
you know,
if,

1343
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,230
if you had judges subjectively judging,
not,

1344
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,340
not necessarily like who won the round 
or looking at counts,

1345
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,183
but like who styled it.
I like how fast and how much power did 

1346
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:54,810
he have,
how did he link is,

1347
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,950
you know,
strikes together.

1348
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,950
Just a subjective element to it.
But unfortunately,

1349
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,150
unlike surfing the is not the judges,
they're not,

1350
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:07,530
it's not comprised of former fighters 
were people that really know a lot of,

1351
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,810
which is wrong,
totally wrong.

1352
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:11,980
It's awful.
I mean some,

1353
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:12,843
some surfers really believed that the 
judges should just be x pros that were 

1354
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:16,204
tour level guys that make those calls.
It seems like there's enough of those 

1355
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:21,820
guys out there.
There are,

1356
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:23,410
there may be,
but you know,

1357
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:24,244
getting back to why that kind of leads 
me back to like you asked why guys 

1358
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:30,010
didn't have the longevity that people 
get married,

1359
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:34,120
have kids and have a life back home.
All of that kind of stuff.

1360
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:35,360
So,
you know,

1361
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,670
I was sort of not quite the traditional 
route with all that stuff.

1362
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,623
Um,
so I had a lot more time focused 

1363
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:43,504
dedication into what I was doing and I 
wanted to do it for a long time because 

1364
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:50,330
I just love surfing and I mean it.
If I had my druthers every day I'm gonna

1365
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,183
wake up and go ride waves.
Now is there a point system that this 

1366
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:54,550
Koran Yep.

1367
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:59,080
Out of 10 out of 10 boxing,
not everybody gets a nine.

1368
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,450
If they lose that battle,
you know,

1369
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:03,580
it's um,
10 is the Max tens Max,

1370
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,414
but I mean more average.
You're seeing threes and fours than you 

1371
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:07,084
are eights and nines because you know,
it's just a certain wave in a certain 

1372
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:14,320
skill set gets you up to that excellent 
category.

1373
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,990
So we consider eight and up.
Excellent.

1374
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,600
And you know,
sort of six,

1375
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:20,434
five to eight is like really good.
And is there a lot of debate about 

1376
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:27,670
whether or not I have a nine?
Is,

1377
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,430
is,
is accurate for someone's Rod?

1378
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,391
Yeah,
yeah,

1379
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:32,650
there is.
Well,

1380
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,380
if,
if it's early,

1381
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,800
there's a lot to it,
you know,

1382
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,713
like if it's early in a heat and a guy 
gets a nine or a girl gets a nine and 

1383
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,890
then you think that there's a lot more 
that could have been done either on that

1384
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:47,350
day in those types of waves or on that 
wave specifically.

1385
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,980
Like some occasionally you see somebody 
get 10 perfect.

1386
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:53,350
Why as good as you can possibly do.
It's the ultimate,

1387
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:55,240
you should remember that way forever 
kind of thing.

1388
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:56,074
You know,
it's like the perfect knockout but then 

1389
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,973
won't,
they'll kick off the wave when there's 

1390
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:03,490
more to ride or they'll fall and they 
still get a 10.

1391
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,690
So like sometimes you'll see somebody 
get a really good score and you know,

1392
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:09,970
a lot more could have been done.
They could've been deeper in that tube,

1393
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:10,960
they could have been higher in that 
area,

1394
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:12,670
they could have rotated it kind of,
you know,

1395
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:13,504
more they could in the air,
they could have written out like 

1396
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,310
smoother.
It could have linked a couple different,

1397
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,860
more difficult turns together,
added more variety.

1398
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:25,760
So you have to kind of like if anything 
scaled down,

1399
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:28,460
I think as a judge as opposed to scale 
up because then you,

1400
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,550
if,
if you're surfing in really great waves,

1401
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,110
which makes it easier to get a good 
score.

1402
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,480
So like Tropo in Tahiti,
if you,

1403
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:36,314
if you pull up Tahiti,
I'm show poor t a h u t o m contest 

1404
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,154
2014.
So we had really unbelievable waves in 

1405
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:49,754
this contest.
I'm almost every wave looked like it 

1406
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,054
could be a 10.
Then it comes down to like how late did 

1407
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:56,660
you drop in?
How critical was it?

1408
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:57,494
How deep were you,
how did you maximize your time in there 

1409
00:59:59,501 --> 01:00:02,540
by slowing your speed,
how much risk did you take?

1410
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,360
So even though they've only lasted about
five seconds,

1411
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:08,300
there was a whole lot that can be 
condensed into that five seconds.

1412
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,930
And did you wait for one of the biggest 
waves or did you take a smaller wave and

1413
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:13,610
take and go,
you know,

1414
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:14,803
a little bit easier?
What is it like when one of those giant 

1415
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:19,950
tubes crashes down on top of you?
Um,

1416
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,041
yeah.
So this game,

1417
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,490
Medina,
he,

1418
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:23,870
he ended up winning the contest.

1419
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,780
Um,
it's not super fun when you eat.

1420
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,560
It could imagine that you've probably 
talked to Shane.

1421
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:31,690
That's me actually.
Yeah,

1422
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,030
I've talked to Shannon about it.
Yeah.

1423
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,190
And I mean,
look,

1424
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:36,830
Shane,
no one's more of an authority than Shane

1425
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,560
is.
Maybe not in the super hollow,

1426
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:40,910
crazy stuff.
Whatever.

1427
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:41,744
Shane writes everything.
But the biggest waves in the world 

1428
01:00:43,131 --> 01:00:43,964
changes the authority.
Like he's had wipe outs that he came 

1429
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:47,834
close to dying.
He probably talked to about their vest 

1430
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:51,620
he created because of that,
he almost drowned.

1431
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,740
He created a vest that you pull the co 
two cartridge and it bless,

1432
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,933
you know,
this big bladder and lift you to the 

1433
01:00:56,691 --> 01:00:57,524
surface.
Even if you get knocked out or taken 

1434
01:00:58,631 --> 01:01:00,470
water,
someone's going to find you and probably

1435
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:02,030
save you.
Um,

1436
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,730
but yeah,
this is me there.

1437
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,180
So I didn't make that,
but that wasn't even a big one.

1438
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,330
You're not that for that day.
That was a small way of fucking huge.

1439
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,280
The one that's coming down to see where 
I'm at.

1440
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,780
I'm kind of in blue water.
Right.

1441
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,050
So I was able to dive and kind of get 
under it and not get sucked back over.

1442
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,810
So there's a little bit of a skill that 
goes with wiping out.

1443
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,790
So you understand that energy.
It's,

1444
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,630
you know,
it's like a,

1445
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,110
it's like a tornado or a hurricane.
Like the eye wall is the worst.

1446
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:28,550
But your fear in the center,
you're fine.

1447
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:29,660
You know,
I always,

1448
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,493
I've always wondered like,
could you follow a hurricane inside the 

1449
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:33,014
center of the eye?
Like could you just stay with it and be 

1450
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:35,810
okay?
I bet you could.

1451
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,030
If you moved to a really slow speed 
right there,

1452
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:38,864
don't move them.
They only move about 10 to 20 miles an 

1453
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:40,700
hour.

1454
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,950
Sometimes less kind of playing go that 
slow.

1455
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,170
No,
but maybe you could stay in the car,

1456
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:46,570
run,
kind of like know,

1457
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,850
find a road.
If you had a really good gps system,

1458
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:52,280
you've got to go,
no,

1459
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:52,630
no,
no,

1460
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:53,630
no.
Go northwest,

1461
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:54,700
go northeast.
Yeah,

1462
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,753
I'm okay.
You're going to have to go off road or 

1463
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:58,220
you'll die.
But.

1464
01:01:58,221 --> 01:02:00,380
So that energy,
all that energy is in where the lip,

1465
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,280
where the,
you know,

1466
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,230
if you're in the center that you're 
pretty safe.

1467
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,390
But as soon as you get sucked in right 
into the wall,

1468
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:06,980
that,
and you get pitched in the limb,

1469
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,730
that's when the lips spreads the water 
that it hits and it sends you right down

1470
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:11,564
to the,
especially in a place like this where 

1471
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:15,170
it's,
when you see a way that's real hollow,

1472
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:18,350
it's generally a lot shallower than it 
is high.

1473
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,850
So the wave will be 15 feet in the 
water,

1474
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:22,140
might only be five or six feet deep.

1475
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:25,080
So think of all that energy it's going 
to hit.

1476
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,030
Most of it's going to hit the reef at 
some point.

1477
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,550
So that's a,
you want to,

1478
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,600
you want to try to kind of fall like 
where that lives landing and then escape

1479
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,820
under it into blue water.
What do you do?

1480
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,700
You know you're going to hit a reef,
you kind of just breaks,

1481
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,760
you don't want to hit your head.
Um,

1482
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,200
for the most part you can tell up and 
down.

1483
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,773
I mean,
sometimes you lose your equilibrium a 

1484
01:02:46,021 --> 01:02:46,854
little bit underwater.
But for the most part you can tell what 

1485
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,070
is up and down so you can feel it 
coming.

1486
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,130
And I'm going to put my arms there 
before I take it on my head.

1487
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,130
And so I'm,
I'm like trying to be like a cat,

1488
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:57,300
like when I hit,
I want to be able to,

1489
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,830
I'll break my hands or feet or whatever,
you know,

1490
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:00,600
I'm not worried about that.

1491
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,070
I don't want to get knocked out.
Right,

1492
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:02,431
right,
right.

1493
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:06,810
So I think everyone,
a default is to try to cover your head.

1494
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,900
Um,
you know,

1495
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,320
if you hit anywhere else you're kind of 
okay.

1496
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:13,620
You just don't want to hit your head.
And when the waves come crashing down on

1497
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:15,750
you,
do you lose your sense of up and down?

1498
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:17,310
You can.
Yeah.

1499
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,140
But you know,
you,

1500
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,470
you also have your board connected from 
the leash and that's usually,

1501
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,010
that's generally going to pull up.
So you kind of know,

1502
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,070
um,
if you don't feel you're aboard pulling,

1503
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,230
you're kind of worried like,
shit,

1504
01:03:31,231 --> 01:03:33,210
my board might hit me,
might spare me underwater.

1505
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,103
You know,
you can occasionally get spirit in the 

1506
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:37,860
face with your board or fin or something
that's kind of spooky.

1507
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,403
Um,
I was surfing with a guy who's like a 

1508
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,050
big brother and I used to travel with 
Tom Carroll.

1509
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:43,883
He's a two time world champion.
We're surfing Tahiti one time together 

1510
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,580
and he used to wear a helmet.
A lot of guys,

1511
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:49,140
don't worry,
most people don't wear a helmet,

1512
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:51,990
but tom used to wear a helmet.
He was real really used to it.

1513
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:53,310
But having something,
you know,

1514
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:55,590
an extra say inch around your head or 
half inch,

1515
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,050
it's like,
it changes your judgment a little.

1516
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:01,050
So you got to be used to it.
I always felt like it was weird.

1517
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,560
It's weird for aspiring to.
It fucks with your peripheral vision.

1518
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

1519
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:09,150
So it would mess with me when I tried to
wear them and that extra weight and like

1520
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,670
when we're trying to,
on a critical way of.

1521
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:12,840
We're trying to pull in the barrel,
we're,

1522
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,430
we are dealing with inches,
you know,

1523
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:16,223
percentage of inches.
Like just tucking your head into that 

1524
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,753
lip.
And so you gotta you gotta kind of be 

1525
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:20,664
really aware of your range and your,
your ability to like Tuck your head at 

1526
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:24,534
certain places and I was never 
comfortable with it but certainly with 

1527
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:31,200
Tom and he wiped out and his board 
spirit him in the ear and it broke,

1528
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:35,040
it broke the helmet and broke his ear 
drum Jesus.

1529
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:35,933
So we were just wondering like,
what the hell would have happened if he 

1530
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:39,170
didn't have his helmet on?
You know,

1531
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,610
like probably would've killed him,
you know,

1532
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:42,483
would it definitely knocked them out and
we didn't have a jet ski with us that 

1533
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:45,953
day or anything.
We were,

1534
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,020
you know,
500 yards or more off the beach,

1535
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,940
half mile off the beach somewhere at 
this wreath.

1536
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,793
And blow your ear drum like that.
Do you have to get it surgically 

1537
01:04:53,341 --> 01:04:54,360
repaired?
Uh,

1538
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:56,610
no.
I don't think so.

1539
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,533
I think I've never just let it heal up.
I almost busted my eardrum like six 

1540
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:01,870
weeks ago in Hawaii.
Just free dive in.

1541
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:04,470
I felt it like,
like a pinhole leak.

1542
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,693
I could feel it like going and I kind of
got dizzy and I just came up and stop 

1543
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:09,930
diving.
But um,

1544
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:13,520
there was a guy,
I'm like,

1545
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:14,730
I've got a buddy named Greg Long.

1546
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,620
He's,
he has drowned and he been attacked by a

1547
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:19,870
shark.
Not Too many people can say those things

1548
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,620
and he's life.
How do you get saved when he drowned?

1549
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,170
A,
that's a really crazy story,

1550
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,393
but I'll just talk about one sec.
But he did break his ear drum at 

1551
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:32,830
mavericks up in northern California and 
he just,

1552
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:35,350
you just flounder.
You don't know what you think.

1553
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,430
You're swimming one direction.
You're,

1554
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,413
it's like you have,
it's like your boats turn in and you 

1555
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:41,500
don't know which there was no rudder,
you know,

1556
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,200
and you don't know what's up and down 
and you know,

1557
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,043
you think you're something up and you're
going sideways and it's really 

1558
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:47,970
dangerous.
There was a,

1559
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,913
there was guy in Hawaii a couple of 
years ago that drone surfing an outer 

1560
01:05:51,521 --> 01:05:52,354
reef.
He and a friend of mine caught a wave 

1561
01:05:53,981 --> 01:05:55,360
and this guy wiped out.

1562
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,980
He didn't have all he had with surf 
trunks and generally will wear like even

1563
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:01,930
a wetsuit,
which is just then,

1564
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:02,764
but it keeps you warm and even that's 
enough flotation to where if you'd got 

1565
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,140
knocked out,
you'd probably come to the surface.

1566
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:13,680
So this guy wiped out his leash broke,
so he lost his board and then we think,

1567
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,830
you know,
the guys who are out there think that he

1568
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,693
popped his eardrum because they said 
they saw him hit the surface and start 

1569
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,490
like his feet were coming up and his 
hand was coming up and you know,

1570
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,333
he was kind of just floundering around 
and then the next wave hit and they 

1571
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:28,500
never saw him again,
but he was only in surf trunks.

1572
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:30,510
So they didn't ever find the body.
Um,

1573
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,160
because he didn't float up.
But if he just had it,

1574
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,490
even just a wet suit,
just some neoprene ever found the bomb,

1575
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:36,280
didn't find him.

1576
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,180
The waves were huge.
It was,

1577
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:37,990
you know,
it was like 40,

1578
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,100
50 foot,
whatever.

1579
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,610
But it was really unfortunate.
It was a real.

1580
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:43,743
Those things are really like sobering in
the surf community because we all know 

1581
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:50,770
each other and um,
and you know,

1582
01:06:50,771 --> 01:06:53,950
ultimately you're doing this for fun and
you know,

1583
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:55,660
it's,
it's a,

1584
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,570
it's a heavy thing,
but it's crazy that your eardrum affects

1585
01:06:58,571 --> 01:06:59,570
you that much.
Yeah,

1586
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:00,543
I mean I've seen,
I've seen people that have inner ear 

1587
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:04,630
infections and they'll get dizzy 
walking.

1588
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:05,493
I just don't know what they're doing 
while they're one front in front of the 

1589
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:08,740
other,
they want to fall sideways.

1590
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,430
It's very strange.
Yeah.

1591
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:11,800
Well,
so greg,

1592
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,633
Greg Long,
he drowned actually at a place called 

1593
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:14,824
Cortez Bank,
which is about 120 miles off the coast 

1594
01:07:17,021 --> 01:07:19,060
of Dana Point.
It's just a re.

1595
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:22,570
It's basically that the top of a 
mountain on an island that never hit the

1596
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,404
surface.

1597
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:24,603
And it was discovered when,
I think it was a nuclear ship actually 

1598
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,660
grounded itself on that reef back,
I don't know,

1599
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,880
30 years ago or something and caused a 
lot of,

1600
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,730
caused tens of millions of dollars of 
damage to the ship navy ship.

1601
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,510
Um,
and yeah,

1602
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,490
I don't know if they had sounded the 
bottom by then.

1603
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,700
It must not have known it was there,
but um,

1604
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,213
anyways,
this wave breaks when it's really big 

1605
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,150
and I'm,
Shane's been out there.

1606
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:52,930
Shane was actually,
I think Shane was out there this day,

1607
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,690
not positive,
but I'm pretty sure Shane was out during

1608
01:07:55,691 --> 01:07:58,030
this session.
There's about 15 guys out,

1609
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,950
doesn't guys out and Greg took off on a 
wave and a,

1610
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:05,230
somebody who in front of him on the 
wave,

1611
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,180
which kind of changed his angle a little
bit,

1612
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:08,014
but he,
I don't think he would've made the wave 

1613
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:10,990
anyhow,
but it just puts them in a little bit of

1614
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:12,160
a precarious situation.

1615
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,830
Um,
and he ate it.

1616
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:15,733
It was down a long time.
This wave has just so much energy in it 

1617
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:22,640
because there's nothing between where 
the wave started and this break,

1618
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,390
like it's thousands and thousands of 
feet deep that,

1619
01:08:25,391 --> 01:08:26,660
you know,
over the whole Pacific.

1620
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,870
So there's no continental shelf to slow 
the wave down.

1621
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:33,680
Know if you can imagine the east coast.
We have small waves.

1622
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,603
A big part of that,
part of that is because most of the 

1623
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,990
storms go west to east and they don't 
come towards us.

1624
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,273
But even on a hurricane are our surf,
not that big because we have a 

1625
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:44,690
continental shelf that goes,
you can go out,

1626
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,780
you can go out 20 miles and it's 70 feet
deep someplaces.

1627
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:51,650
So the swells just drag in the Pacific.
They don't drag,

1628
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:52,484
there's just nothing to get in the way.
So these wells are going 35 miles an 

1629
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:56,174
hour when they hit.

1630
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,940
So it's a lot faster than a normal wave.
So there's all this energy and the wave.

1631
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,380
And so when Greg went down and this wave
is probably a 40 foot face or whatever,

1632
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:04,214
50 face,
he was underwater and he's really 

1633
01:09:06,831 --> 01:09:07,640
calling.
He's,

1634
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,380
you know,
he's probably as,

1635
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:12,560
as ready for anybody in big surf.
He's totally prepared.

1636
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:13,543
He's done all the CPR and breathing 
courses and everything and he was real 

1637
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:18,620
calm and he said he pulled his vest and 
it didn't work.

1638
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,473
And then he pulled another one and it 
didn't work and he pulled it a third 

1639
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:25,430
time and it didn't work.
And so he's like,

1640
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:27,020
Oh fuck,
I'm screwed.

1641
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,220
You know,
that kind of thing.

1642
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,270
But he,
at that point,

1643
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,860
you're,
when you start to pull it,

1644
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,900
you,
you're already in a little bit of a,

1645
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,363
some,
some guys pull it right away just to be 

1646
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:36,680
safe when a big wave.

1647
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,933
But some guys kind of wait and go,
I'll see if I'm able to pull this one 

1648
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:40,934
off and I'll save my little canister 
because you only have like some of the 

1649
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,220
vets have to earth two canisters,
some have four.

1650
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,370
So you don't want to have to change your
canisters over.

1651
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,170
So if you're thinking going to make 
that,

1652
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:53,660
you're going to get back to the surface.
Are you okay?

1653
01:09:53,661 --> 01:09:55,050
You can handle it and you got a good 
breath.

1654
01:09:55,051 --> 01:09:55,820
You're like,
I'll just,

1655
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,653
I won't pull it.
But he pulled three times and then he 

1656
01:09:57,921 --> 01:09:58,754
blacked out and they,
luckily it had really good water safety 

1657
01:10:02,961 --> 01:10:03,794
crew and um,
I don't know that it was his brother 

1658
01:10:06,741 --> 01:10:07,574
that saved them.
But a couple of the guys went and 

1659
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:10,790
grabbed dove in and pull them up by the 
leash.

1660
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,313
Luckily he was to the least because he 
wasn't floating because he didn't have 

1661
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:15,284
the CEO too.

1662
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:19,470
And then he had taken a lot of water and
uh,

1663
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:20,503
they had to airlift him off the boat in 
height and big seas that night after 

1664
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:28,250
dark and got him back to the mainland.
So did they do cpr on him?

1665
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,150
They did CPR.
Yeah.

1666
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,070
And then the come back to consciousness 
came back to consciousness,

1667
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,960
but he was like awake when the airlift 
and nobody gets fucked up.

1668
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,880
Yeah.
But guys can have secondary drowning.

1669
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,013
Um,
we still have water in the lungs and 

1670
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:41,810
you're not aware of the symptoms or 
whatever.

1671
01:10:41,811 --> 01:10:43,190
Get it out.
Um,

1672
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:45,030
I don't know.
They pump it off it out.

1673
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,170
They can't just hang by your ankles or 
anything.

1674
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:48,260
Yeah,
I think they pump it out.

1675
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,273
I was with a buddy in Australia a year 
and a half ago and then he almost 

1676
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:53,840
drowned,
got knocked out his board,

1677
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:56,570
hit him in the chin,
knocked him out cold.

1678
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,750
And uh,
I was,

1679
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,540
I was sitting out the back waiting for a
wave and I heard everyone kind of,

1680
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:03,963
I heard another friend screaming.
Luckily the waves kind of stopped and 

1681
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:07,424
they were able to get to them,
pull them up on a jet ski and he had 

1682
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:14,940
taken it in some water and he's puking 
and coffin and all this stuff and I came

1683
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:17,550
up from behind and I didn't see his 
neck.

1684
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:19,920
Um,
and I heard,

1685
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,210
I heard one of the guys say,
Oh,

1686
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:24,000
he got his board,
hit him in the neck and the throat,

1687
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:28,890
and so I was expecting this artery be 
cut or like the throat to be open.

1688
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,180
Like I was like,
okay,

1689
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:31,440
I don't want to look yet,
you know,

1690
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:34,140
because I was behind him.
I didn't want to get it to go around him

1691
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:34,951
and try to look.
I'm like,

1692
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:36,000
okay,
let's get him into the beach.

1693
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,100
Luckily we had a jet ski because we were
about a mile off shore.

1694
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,500
And um,
I just,

1695
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:44,030
I held on the jet ski and kind of,
I just squeezed on behalf on the.

1696
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,690
We have a sled on the back of the jet 
ski,

1697
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,940
like a body big giant bodyboard with 
handles.

1698
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:51,540
So I just kind of straddled him.
My other friend rode the ski all the way

1699
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:53,700
up on the beach and then I thought,
okay,

1700
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:54,960
when we get the beach I'm going to have 
to see,

1701
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:57,420
this is going to be gory.
But luckily he wasn't opened up.

1702
01:11:57,421 --> 01:12:00,750
He just had a huge hematoma here on his 
neck and he,

1703
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:03,630
it didn't slice him.
It just like contusion,

1704
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:05,970
like blunt force.
That's very lucky.

1705
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,833
Yeah.
But he spent two or three days in the 

1706
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:09,990
hospital because they were worried about
secondary drowning,

1707
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:12,510
which I don't exactly know what 
secondary drowning means,

1708
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:14,010
but I guess when you have water,
salt,

1709
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:15,900
water in your lungs,
it can.

1710
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:17,483
I don't know,
maybe from the way you laid down or I 

1711
01:12:19,371 --> 01:12:20,204
don't know,
I should probably be super school 

1712
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,950
mistakes you're living.
Right?

1713
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:25,030
But uh,
yeah,

1714
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,470
you must see a lot of crazy shit in the 
water.

1715
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,930
Like I'm seeing some crazy stuff.
Yeah.

1716
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,240
Wildlife.
And I mean,

1717
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:38,241
you must see an amazing amount of fish 
and the shark copics super.

1718
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:39,450
It never ends,
you know,

1719
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:40,284
like,
I mean anyone in the world I meet is 

1720
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:42,671
like,
Oh,

1721
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:45,150
I'm scared of sharks.
Told me about that story.

1722
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:48,840
Doesn't ever end that story like it's a 
primal fear,

1723
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,910
like getting eaten by a monster,
you know,

1724
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:52,523
you feel so vulnerable in the water.
I mean maybe you feel less vulnerable 

1725
01:12:54,931 --> 01:12:58,260
because you're bored and you have a 
board knew so quick with the board,

1726
01:12:58,710 --> 01:12:59,610
but like someone like,
oh,

1727
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,553
you,
you are totally vulnerable if a great 

1728
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:03,600
white one too.
Oh yeah,

1729
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,580
completely.
If you're,

1730
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,480
if a shark over,
I mean,

1731
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:09,810
even if a six foot shark wants you,
but that's the,

1732
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,670
that's the misconception.
You know,

1733
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:12,570
everyone thinks,
oh,

1734
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:15,510
shark death,
you know,

1735
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:19,390
jaws just fucked everybody up.
So I was seven or something when,

1736
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:23,460
when I was six,
I think when jaws came out and I watched

1737
01:13:23,461 --> 01:13:23,761
it,
you know,

1738
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:25,680
I watched brick poltergeist when I was 
10.

1739
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:28,470
My parents let me watch everything and 
mine to.

1740
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:33,390
Maybe that's why I always thought there 
was some boogeyman in the closet,

1741
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:34,081
you know,
or whatever.

1742
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:37,860
But yeah,
it keeps your prepared.

1743
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,930
Maybe that's why I started training with
a dragon,

1744
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:41,310
you know?
But uh,

1745
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,920
um,
so jaws,

1746
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:45,510
I wouldn't even go in the deep end of a 
pool.

1747
01:13:45,511 --> 01:13:46,344
I was so freaked out that I was like,
there's going to be a shark at the deep 

1748
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:51,870
end somewhere and you know,
I would only stay in the shallow end for

1749
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,880
a couple of years when I was like five 
or six,

1750
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:55,950
you know.
But uh,

1751
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,420
yeah.
So anyway,

1752
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:59,190
so greg got to the hospital.
He was all right.

1753
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:04,280
Um,
what about a year and a half ago,

1754
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,870
a friend of ours who's a great big wave,
got like,

1755
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,650
this guy is completely,
totally fearless.

1756
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:14,590
He drowned in Fiji and Greg,
who had,

1757
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,830
who I talked about it,
Cortez Greg actually did CPR and brought

1758
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:18,550
him back.

1759
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,570
Wow.
And um,

1760
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:20,260
they're,
they're,

1761
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:20,800
you know,
the,

1762
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,633
the big wave guys are a tight.
It's a tight bond of camaraderie with 

1763
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:27,010
these guys because I mean,
yeah,

1764
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:29,060
everyone wants that big wave.
They want that biggest way.

1765
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,120
They want something they have never had,
but they want their,

1766
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:33,310
they're all really close friends.
Like they're,

1767
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,233
they know that there's life and death 
having each other's backs and pretty 

1768
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:38,800
much everyone knows cpr.
Most.

1769
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,673
Yeah.
Most everybody that.

1770
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,070
There's courses that the big wave guys 
run every year.

1771
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,470
They put these courses together a couple
times a year,

1772
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:47,770
um,
specifically to train for the situations

1773
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:50,260
that we could be in and um,
yeah,

1774
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:53,170
so it's really,
really great because they bring in a lot

1775
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:54,004
of,
you know,

1776
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:55,623
breath hold deep freediving people and 
the best cpr and lifeguard guys in the 

1777
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,450
world,
a lot of the best life guard guys in the

1778
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:02,260
world are already surfers.

1779
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,040
Anyway,
on the north shore of Awahoo.

1780
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,123
I'm in Maui and uh,
I mean those are the guys you want to 

1781
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,850
have your back when there's in the surf 
zone.

1782
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,760
Some guy in the coast guard's probably 
not gonna be able to do the same.

1783
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,490
Like they might help your boat,
but they're not.

1784
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,700
And I'm not trying to put coast guard 
guys down at all in any way.

1785
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,010
I'm just saying like these guys trained 
specifically for in the Whitewater,

1786
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:26,680
in big surf,
you know,

1787
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:28,930
they train the seal team,
six guys in Hawaii every year,

1788
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:34,020
so it for heavy situations.
So how often do you actually see shorts?

1789
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,000
Depends where you're at.
In Florida,

1790
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:39,220
I see sharks almost daily.
Real.

1791
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,600
Yeah.
I live in Florida.

1792
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:41,523
I'm from Florida.
I still go back there and most days you 

1793
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,333
surf,
you'll see in certain places you'll see 

1794
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:49,120
a lot of why I live here.

1795
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,440
I live in Hawaii,
I live on Australia.

1796
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:51,963
Oh Damn.
You're.

1797
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:55,840
I'm a nomad.
I'm not going to modern nomad,

1798
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:56,674
you know,
but I'm cheap apartments in different 

1799
01:15:58,271 --> 01:15:59,590
places.
So when I,

1800
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,603
when I first started making money,
I thought that would be cool to have a 

1801
01:16:02,111 --> 01:16:06,250
little place in each place I go that I 
kind of based out of so I can be feeling

1802
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:07,084
like home on the roads.
That's another thing is like I've 

1803
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:10,600
always,
I've,

1804
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,630
I wanted to make the world like my home 
when I was a kid.

1805
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,210
I just love traveling.
I love meeting people everywhere.

1806
01:16:16,211 --> 01:16:20,440
I love having these sort of household 
feeling,

1807
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,341
uh,
you know,

1808
01:16:21,341 --> 01:16:22,174
families everywhere and stuff.
So in Australia I bought a place in 

1809
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:28,270
Sydney when I was 20.
I'm with a friend,

1810
01:16:28,271 --> 01:16:29,104
you know,
I just bought this real humble two 

1811
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,840
bedroom,
tiny little two bedroom on the beach,

1812
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,250
like just back from the beach.

1813
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,690
My old roommate and I talk about it now,
we're like,

1814
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,710
why don't we buy that whole freaking 
apartment block,

1815
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:40,060
you know,
because it was cheap back then.

1816
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:42,130
It was like 150 bucks,
150,000

1817
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:44,830
bucks per apartment Australia,
which was like $100,000

1818
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:48,550
us at the time.
So I bought I own half of that for about

1819
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:52,240
15 years and then I sold that and I 
bought another place up near.

1820
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:56,620
I'm on the Gold Coast in Australia.
Australia has a lot of dangerous shit,

1821
01:16:56,621 --> 01:16:57,454
right?
Because they have every dangerous shit 

1822
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,060
box.
Jelly fish.

1823
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,950
Yeah.
They box jelly fish,

1824
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:03,850
salt,
water crocs.

1825
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,910
Lots of great whites while you're 
surfing.

1826
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,660
No,
I.

1827
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,770
Well I have.
Yeah,

1828
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:11,380
I have Costa Rica Do.
That's scary.

1829
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,700
That's those things.
People talk about sharks.

1830
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,880
Sharks don't hunt you.
They might bite you if they see you,

1831
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:17,714
you know,
like,

1832
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:19,090
but uh,
uh,

1833
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:22,250
a saltwater croc.
That thing is watching you.

1834
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,113
It can feel you walking in.
It knows from that vibration how close 

1835
01:17:25,731 --> 01:17:27,970
you are to the water's edge.
It knows exactly.

1836
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:28,873
I can pinpoint it.
Can pinpoint to the waters edge where 

1837
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:32,594
you're at.
Yeah.

1838
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:33,703
That noise,
my friend Adam Green tree lives in 

1839
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:38,380
Australia and he's not all over 
Australia.

1840
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,310
They're everywhere.
No,

1841
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,153
no.
Do Your House.

1842
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:40,551
No,
no.

1843
01:17:40,551 --> 01:17:42,110
They're waiting for you at the 
supermarket.

1844
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,653
But they do keep track.
Like I know that the closest one to the 

1845
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:46,844
Gold Coast where I'm from is like,
it's still like 300 miles north or 

1846
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:50,990
something like 200,
whatever.

1847
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:52,850
It's like the closest saltwater crocs.
Yeah.

1848
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,620
They keep a track,
like,

1849
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,200
you know,
they're pretty visual and about how,

1850
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,210
where they are,
what rivers they would be.

1851
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,340
Because I got to warn people like,
don't swim here.

1852
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,470
Some people don't listen,
they're stupid and they die.

1853
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:04,993
But like a crock snuck on to just sort 
of give you an exploratory bite like a 

1854
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:09,390
great white might in review.

1855
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,710
They're going to snatch you and there,
you know,

1856
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:15,260
and they're not going to get the 
surfboard in the way from the underbite,

1857
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,280
you know,
they're gonna.

1858
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:17,720
There was a horrible story that I read 
it.

1859
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:20,060
I think it was a national geographic 
about this.

1860
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:23,820
These two people that were kayaking in 
the river in Africa and this guy was the

1861
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,730
guy went with them.
Did you?

1862
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,850
This might be a different story.
I don't know what story did you hear?

1863
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,013
This one was like,
these two guys were going to do a first 

1864
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:34,250
descent down this thing and they were 
contacting another guy who had done that

1865
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:35,390
river,
an American guy,

1866
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,780
and the American guy was like,
I can't miss this descent.

1867
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,880
I got to do this.
I got to do that whole river.

1868
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:42,523
And then the three of them got into the 
zone where they're just everywhere in 

1869
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:48,440
the river was real slow and wide and as 
soon as they got there,

1870
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:51,740
all the river,
all the crux came off the river bank and

1871
01:18:51,741 --> 01:18:52,760
they were like,
oh shit.

1872
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,593
There's like tons of them.
And this guy's theory was to take his 

1873
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:56,534
helmet and throw it off to the side so 
it would be like movement and distract 

1874
01:18:58,701 --> 01:19:00,520
them.
And they'd attack that and he paddled to

1875
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,363
shore and all three of them got together
and the American guy was on the right 

1876
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:06,800
side and the other two guys were 
together and they were so close.

1877
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:09,080
They see like the guy in the middle like
couldn't really paddle.

1878
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,590
He would just kinda like,
you know,

1879
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:11,503
trying to move along with them.
And so they figured if the bigger we 

1880
01:19:14,031 --> 01:19:14,864
are,
the bigger we look and more 

1881
01:19:15,591 --> 01:19:17,240
intimidating,
like maybe it will be okay.

1882
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,700
Fifteen,
18 foot crop comes up,

1883
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,950
grabs the guy,
takes him out of his,

1884
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,150
pulls them out,
as Kayak disappears,

1885
01:19:23,151 --> 01:19:25,430
they never see him again.
His backpack floats up.

1886
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,190
And then this stuff's floating down 
downstream.

1887
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,620
The other two guys get out of the water.
And um,

1888
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:31,933
I think I'm telling the story pretty 
good because I read it like five times 

1889
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:35,623
online too.
And they got other water and then there 

1890
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:41,920
was a little village just down and there
was a little bridge over and they had,

1891
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:42,853
there were some boats when the boats 
were all dry docked and they went down 

1892
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:48,260
and in broken English it was one person 
that could talk to him or whatever.

1893
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:49,094
And they said,
we know our boats are not in the water 

1894
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,293
because there's too many crocs here.
Like we know not to go in the water 

1895
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,160
because they were like,
we need a boat.

1896
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:57,170
We got to find his body,
we got to try and save him,

1897
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:58,004
you know?
And then they went to the bridge and 

1898
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:02,300
watch this stuff like float by.
That's the same story.

1899
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,190
It's.
And the guy wasn't supposed to be on the

1900
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:05,690
trip and there was about the,
the,

1901
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,400
the Kayak flipping and then pulling

1902
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:10,880
his body out under the Kayak.
Yeah.

1903
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,980
Brutal.
They're monsters.

1904
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,550
It's a,
there's a show called.

1905
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,453
They really are.
There's a show called uncharted by what 

1906
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:23,460
you've seen that show.
My friend Jim shockey is Florida.

1907
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,353
Yeah.
That's 15 foot fucking alligator they 

1908
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:29,040
found in Florida was strolling across 
the golf course.

1909
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,050
And the next day they found a giant 
snake,

1910
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,750
a giant rattlesnake strolling across a 
golf course.

1911
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,290
Look at the size of that thing I fed,
you know,

1912
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:37,203
I was friends with Steve Irwin.
So you said go to look at the size of 

1913
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:42,780
that thing on a golf course.
Here's the thing.

1914
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:44,773
I,
I,

1915
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,003
I,
I think there's a misconstrued 

1916
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:47,963
misconception about the crocs.
And they actually talked about this 

1917
01:20:50,701 --> 01:20:53,310
because I used to be friends with Steve 
Irwin before he passed away.

1918
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:55,680
He took,
he actually had me hand feet,

1919
01:20:55,681 --> 01:20:56,750
a 13 foot crock,
scary,

1920
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,470
scariest thing I've ever done in my 
life.

1921
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:01,970
Terrified he would you do that?
I don't know.

1922
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,300
He,
he told me,

1923
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:06,600
you know,
you got to feed a crock because like,

1924
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,973
Kelly,
you're ready.

1925
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:10,140
You got a fee.
Crock got to Viagra.

1926
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,730
So for two nights so crazy for two 
nights I had nightmares.

1927
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,000
Look at it.
What is this guy doing?

1928
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,180
I told you I saw this a few weeks ago.
This guy doing.

1929
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:23,340
He's feeding them by hand of these 
things.

1930
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,890
Look at their heads,
kid.

1931
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,640
Good Lord.
And these are wild crocs.

1932
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:30,923
Well,
they look like they know this guy is 

1933
01:21:32,271 --> 01:21:33,960
going to feed him something.
They know something like that.

1934
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:37,740
Bad Man.
Look at the heads on these things,

1935
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:39,990
but see,
this is like the conception we.

1936
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:43,410
The concept we have about these animals,
right?

1937
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,660
We just think that they're just killers 
and whatever.

1938
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:48,450
Do you ever see the guy and limone Costa
Rica who had a pet?

1939
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,520
15 foot crock?
Yeah,

1940
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,040
they did say that guy's an asshole.
This is crazy.

1941
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,900
It's a crazy animal man.
It's a crock.

1942
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,390
Freaked me out.
But I like,

1943
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,930
I kind of miss when I'm playing.
When I'm playing golf.

1944
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:02,850
I played a lot of golf when I'm in 
Florida.

1945
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:05,160
I always messed with the gators.
Like I'll grab him by the tail.

1946
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,620
Yeah.
Why?

1947
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,270
It's kind of.
I don't know.

1948
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:10,104
It's just like,
it's fun until you get your arm bit off 

1949
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:15,020
I guess,
but this guy's not even.

1950
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,770
He doesn't even need to backstep,
you know?

1951
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:18,210
He's like,
well those are smaller.

1952
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,313
Yeah,
but that means that going to rip your 

1953
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:20,634
arm off death roles,
but that's so small in comparison to 

1954
01:22:23,131 --> 01:22:26,960
those other ones.
I was fishing in Australia in this fresh

1955
01:22:26,961 --> 01:22:29,190
water,
a river,

1956
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,470
but it goes down to the ocean.
So salt water crocs come up to a certain

1957
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:34,740
point.

1958
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,450
There's like this dam and they don't go 
past that.

1959
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:37,300
So you know,
down here,

1960
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,270
up here,
appears all the fresh water down here is

1961
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:40,104
fresh and salt water.
And we saw a few 15 foot crocs this day 

1962
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,390
and we're in a boat there was six feet 
wide and 18 feet long,

1963
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:49,440
15,
18 feet long.

1964
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,270
And um,
you know,

1965
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:53,070
the guy taking us,
he said,

1966
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:54,900
you know,
we don't have problem in this boat,

1967
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,220
but you know,
if you fill out the boat,

1968
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,400
there was a problem.
But he was telling us a story.

1969
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:00,234
One day I was fishing with these guys,
this one guy standing up in the boat 

1970
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,590
fishing.
He falls out of it and the guy was about

1971
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:06,010
250 pounds or something,
like

1972
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,720
a big dude,
like maybe 300 pounds.

1973
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:08,554
He was like a big overweight guy and he 
fell the boat and the guy said the guy 

1974
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:14,230
was in the water for about two minutes 
and he was just like,

1975
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,270
any second,
this guy is dead.

1976
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,400
He's like,
there's nothing I can do.

1977
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:19,503
And he said it was all they could do to 
hit dead to get him from the front of 

1978
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:24,310
the boat.
He was trying to pull up up the side and

1979
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:26,170
he couldn't and he was panicking.
So He's,

1980
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,700
you know,
when people go into panic mode,

1981
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:28,534
like when people are drowning and 
they're panicking and they say you got 

1982
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:30,604
to punch them in the face and try to 
knock them out and calm down and they 

1983
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:34,203
couldn't punch this guy like they were.
They were trying to get them to calm 

1984
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:39,220
down and then to get them all the way to
the back of the boat because they had to

1985
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:40,054
get him up the transom and they said 
from there they could get leverage and 

1986
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:44,040
lifting and it wouldn't flip the boat or
whatever.

1987
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,200
But he said this guy was in the water 
for a couple minutes and he's like,

1988
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:48,034
at any time there is a crock that's big 
enough to eat you within sight of us 

1989
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:51,814
here at all times.
But this guy said that he said that I'm 

1990
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,701
the biggest,
you know,

1991
01:23:55,701 --> 01:23:56,780
I said what's the biggest one you ever 
seen?

1992
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:59,620
Because we've seen 15 foot crocs like 
every 20 minutes,

1993
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:01,380
every half an hour.
15 foot.

1994
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,750
Yeah.
No Julian fricking.

1995
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,050
Yeah.
And we're,

1996
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,900
we're fishing.
Oh my God.

1997
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:09,190
I'm,
we're fishing for bear Monday.

1998
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,890
That's a crazy fish.
Yeah.

1999
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:14,980
And um,
and uh,

2000
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:17,430
so we're fishing for money and I keep 
thinking like,

2001
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,720
I don't know when you got one in the 
line is like a shark bite,

2002
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,310
that thing or whatever.
And anyways,

2003
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,260
we start asking the guy,
what's the biggest one you ever saw?

2004
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:24,500
And he said,
mate,

2005
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,470
the biggest one I ever saw was about 28 
feet.

2006
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:27,550
20.
Yeah.

2007
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,730
Twenty nine feet maybe.
And he said he's only seen it once.

2008
01:24:30,731 --> 01:24:33,730
And he sought from about a kilometer 
away and the estimate of the size.

2009
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:34,923
And he said,
this guy,

2010
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:38,500
these guys in a helicopter salt at once 
and it doesn't stay in the river,

2011
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,240
it stays out in the ocean.
And he said,

2012
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,103
it's so smart,
it knows it's in silty water where 

2013
01:24:42,881 --> 01:24:45,450
nothing can see it.
There's nothing as big as it.

2014
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,350
It owns its territory,
you know,

2015
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:48,790
one the eight feet.
Yeah.

2016
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,780
And he said that he said that the back,
we're in the six foot boat.

2017
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,190
And he said,
if this thing,

2018
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,480
he goes,
I tell you this,

2019
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,650
how big they are.
He goes,

2020
01:24:56,651 --> 01:24:58,810
this one would be,
he said if it was under our boat,

2021
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,310
it would be sticking out about four to 
six feet on either side across his back,

2022
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,193
sideways.

2023
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:05,343
And we're in a six foot wide boat.
So he said it'd be like 15 foot across 

2024
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,560
the back.
It's back,

2025
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:10,960
like that's how fucked up.
So think of the girth.

2026
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,620
So something that big 15 feet across the
back.

2027
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:15,970
Yeah,
that's what this guy told me.

2028
01:25:15,971 --> 01:25:16,900
I don't know,
we didn't see it.

2029
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:19,420
Oh my God.
I mean we're seeing,

2030
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,520
you know,
15 footers that are like,

2031
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:23,710
it's girth close to that,
you know,

2032
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:25,810
like a great white.
When you see a 15 foot great white,

2033
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:28,900
it's girth is 15 feet pretty much.
They're so fat.

2034
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,280
Yeah.
Once they get like 10 feet,

2035
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:32,830
then they start getting fat and the 
growth gets about the length them.

2036
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:36,940
So if you see a 15 or 20 foot 18 foot 
great white and you measure their girth,

2037
01:25:36,941 --> 01:25:39,610
it's pretty much their length.
How big the crocs get.

2038
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,290
I don't know.
This guy said,

2039
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,340
I don't know,
this guy's claiming it's like mostly the

2040
01:25:43,341 --> 01:25:44,174
biggest crock in the world,
but there was one they called gus or 

2041
01:25:47,171 --> 01:25:48,004
something in Africa.
I used to go late night just youtube 

2042
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:51,670
this stuff when they were saying this is
the one that had eaten,

2043
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:52,504
like they think it's eaten over 100 or 
200 people in these villages and they 

2044
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,550
think it's like 23 feet long or 
something.

2045
01:25:57,610 --> 01:25:58,443
Well this Jim shockey show that I was 
talking to you about uncharted 

2046
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:02,280
Gustavo's.
Turn him loose.

2047
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,220
Look at that fucking thing.

2048
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:07,250
The Savannah King.
Is that a perspective shot though?

2049
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:09,890
Look how far back those of you wonder.
You wonder.

2050
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:10,783
Yeah,
but people do that with pigs and they 

2051
01:26:11,911 --> 01:26:12,744
make them.
I do that with my 28 when I catch a 

2052
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:16,850
fish,
put it right where it says 28 feet,

2053
01:26:16,851 --> 01:26:18,560
four inches.
So that makes sense.

2054
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:22,460
Like what's that?
That's a replica of how big it was.

2055
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:25,490
Fuck that thing.
Fuck that thing in.

2056
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:29,200
Everything that was alive before that 
made this worse to,

2057
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:31,160
you know,
go back to that picture jamie.

2058
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:31,994
That replica,
make that larger the replica and just 

2059
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:36,800
make that larger.
Look at the size of that fucking thing.

2060
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:42,950
Oh well what is the largest confirmed 
ones?

2061
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,440
Because if that one is 28 feet,
four inches.

2062
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,170
The thing about that,
when they said 28 feet,

2063
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:49,004
four inches,
that's like back when people were full 

2064
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:51,620
of Shit.
Yeah.

2065
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:52,454
I mean this guy who told me this guy 
might've been trying to freak me out 

2066
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:54,920
too.

2067
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,753
I mean because that thing is 20 feet and
it's not 20 feet across his back or 12 

2068
01:27:01,191 --> 01:27:01,660
feet,
you know?

2069
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:03,200
Yeah.
But another eight foot long,

2070
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:05,000
it's pretty.
It's a lot bigger.

2071
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:05,834
And why you see when you see like a five
foot crop or alligator and then you see 

2072
01:27:08,451 --> 01:27:13,020
a 10 foot the girth relative to the 
length changes at that point is.

2073
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:15,110
It's like a.
What he's talking about the ratio in the

2074
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:16,430
size.
It's at one point.

2075
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,840
What does it say?
Number one.

2076
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:19,250
What the say?
Number one candidate.

2077
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,500
This was a list of the top 10.
So I think their largest crunch.

2078
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:25,120
Cambodia crocodiles,
seven me.

2079
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,800
Now,
is this just the species they're talking

2080
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:28,670
about?
Yeah.

2081
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:31,070
This is just the five largest crocodiles
ever recorded.

2082
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:31,700
Oh,
okay.

2083
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,340
Cambodia show the picture of the 
Cambodia 1:23

2084
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:35,780
feet.
That doesn't have a pen.

2085
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:36,291
Oh,
it doesn't.

2086
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,270
So there's only one that had a picture.

2087
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:40,520
Did you not take a picture of a 23 foot 
long crocodile?

2088
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:41,803
Trust me,
bro.

2089
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,170
Shit was big.
Yeah,

2090
01:27:45,171 --> 01:27:47,720
I mean I would imagine that there's 
probably bigger ones out there.

2091
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:52,870
I know there was a super killer croc 
that went extinct that far.

2092
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,223
Dwarfed those.
Those were 60 feet are enormously 

2093
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:59,660
extinct.
Pull up that extinct.

2094
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:00,494
Giant crocodile.
I had a friend who was a commercial 

2095
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:03,980
fisherman in South Africa and he was 
like,

2096
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,300
he told me,
he's like the biggest check,

2097
01:28:06,301 --> 01:28:08,180
so way bigger than you think.
He's like,

2098
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:10,790
I want to see a picture or something.
He said,

2099
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:11,624
I'll tell you this.
I was on a 60 foot boat with 10 guys 

2100
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:15,584
fishing almost a.
He said like everybody in the boat saw 

2101
01:28:17,841 --> 01:28:19,880
the shark he had at camp next to their 
boat.

2102
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:22,370
There were 20 miles off of Port 
Elizabeth where there's this reef,

2103
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:23,204
they fish and he's claiming the thing 
was more than half the length of their 

2104
01:28:25,731 --> 01:28:26,564
60 foot boat.

2105
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:27,830
Yeah.
He's like,

2106
01:28:27,831 --> 01:28:29,570
it was 35 feet.
That's what he tells me.

2107
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:30,613
What is the biggest great white like 20,
but he's saying there's big jock who's 

2108
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:38,930
stoke supposedly filled one and Cape 
Verde that they didn't have anything.

2109
01:28:38,931 --> 01:28:40,910
They couldn't tell the size because they
didn't have something next to it.

2110
01:28:40,911 --> 01:28:43,370
He said it was close to 10 meters,
which is 30 feet,

2111
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,500
but this guy's.
This guy's telling me,

2112
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:46,334
he goes,
no.

2113
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,473
He goes,
I've seen this shark twice out there is 

2114
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:50,510
what he told me,
but I dunno.

2115
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:52,280
They're out there every day.
That's the thing.

2116
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:54,330
How many people are out there?
You know?

2117
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:56,570
I don't know know.
It's like people are the biggest ones.

2118
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:58,250
The biggest ones are smart,
you know?

2119
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,300
Yeah.
Like I don't,

2120
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,330
I rarely see a big shark.
Rarely I'll see.

2121
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,550
Like I've seen a couple of great whites 
in South Africa jump look at that thing,

2122
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:06,743
that,
that is the replica of something that 

2123
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:09,030
used to exist.

2124
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:13,170
12 animals.
You're glad his fucking skull.

2125
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:15,100
This guy's basically standing inside the
skull.

2126
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,950
This crocodile.
So freaky.

2127
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:19,200
Fuck that man.
Well that's that.

2128
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,420
That's the premise of that stupid movie.
The Meg,

2129
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:22,120
meg,
Meg,

2130
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:27,120
A.
I won't even watch it like that.

2131
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,080
Do you remember that movie?
That deep blue.

2132
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:32,910
Is that what it's called?
There was a shark that they were,

2133
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,320
there were sharks.
They were training.

2134
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,393
They were like Gmo sharks are.
So these genetically cloned sharks and 

2135
01:29:39,931 --> 01:29:42,360
they were supposedly training them and 
then they got too smart and they started

2136
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:43,223
eating everyone and then there's like,
you know the girl in the Bikini and she 

2137
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:49,950
has to take off her wetsuit because it's
rubber.

2138
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:50,813
I don't know.
There's,

2139
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:55,380
you see these movies and you just like 
the artistic license on these things are

2140
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:57,330
so bizarre.
There's no truth to it.

2141
01:29:57,331 --> 01:30:00,820
It's like Samuel Jackson was in a rico 
and he starts talking about.

2142
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,040
He goes,
you know what,

2143
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,930
you know what?
Dangerous waters,

2144
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:05,490
not dangerous use as dangerous.

2145
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:13,120
We're going to pull together and we're 
gonna find a way to get out.

2146
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,380
Good moving.
See that?

2147
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,100
I mean,
I wouldn't,

2148
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:22,933
I wouldn't see that coming at all.
I wouldn't go in the water for seconds 

2149
01:30:27,081 --> 01:30:28,700
after that.
So that movie,

2150
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,553
you know,
I actually was with Samuel l Jackson 

2151
01:30:31,221 --> 01:30:34,190
like three weeks ago in Paris.
Golf together.

2152
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:37,310
How big I wanted to ask him about that,
but I didn't.

2153
01:30:37,311 --> 01:30:39,890
I didn't know the balls.
I mean,

2154
01:30:39,891 --> 01:30:42,680
how big do you think they could be?
And people don't know.

2155
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:45,770
I mean 30 feet sounds reasonable.
If they think they're 25 feet,

2156
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:48,080
there could be one that's 30 feet maybe.
Yeah.

2157
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:49,610
I mean I think it's reasonable to go 
and.

2158
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:54,290
But that's a lot more years and eating 
and like no one saw it during that time.

2159
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:58,280
I mean it's Kinda like Ufo is I got to 
see one.

2160
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:02,420
Yeah.
I got to see an alien sharks and we know

2161
01:31:02,421 --> 01:31:05,960
they get big and we're not just how many
people are out there looking for them?

2162
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,793
That's the thing.
But they filmed one they call big blue 

2163
01:31:09,711 --> 01:31:13,010
last year I think in Guadalupe Island.
I think it was.

2164
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:15,920
And it was 22 feet.
Yeah,

2165
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:17,750
the videos online and it's,
you know,

2166
01:31:17,751 --> 01:31:18,650
a big day look,
right?

2167
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:19,513
Yeah.
This thing's face and nose looks small 

2168
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,713
because the body is so huge.
It must've been a pregnant female or 

2169
01:31:23,841 --> 01:31:24,674
something,
but it's body looks like even bigger 

2170
01:31:26,901 --> 01:31:28,620
around in the length.
And they said it was 20.

2171
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:34,410
She like it's face almost looks like 
small to fuck.

2172
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:39,580
Oh my God.
See the girth girth is so foiled.

2173
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,180
Smartest Shark.
Seven meters.

2174
01:31:41,181 --> 01:31:42,460
So that's 20,
22 feet,

2175
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:45,560
23 feet.
What the,

2176
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,200
this guy touches it.
Comes out of the cage and touch it.

2177
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:52,550
Look at the size of this thing.
That's another thing.

2178
01:31:52,551 --> 01:31:55,610
That's the shark feeding freaks me out.
There's this guy touched it,

2179
01:31:55,611 --> 01:31:56,600
watch.
He just comes out and he's like,

2180
01:31:56,601 --> 01:32:00,310
I gotta touch this creature and I got to
get out of there bitch,

2181
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:01,343
but she like his face almost like small 
compared to how a massive so scary that 

2182
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:07,540
is so big.

2183
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:10,930
It looks like a whale.
It literally looks like a whale.

2184
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:13,143
Oh my God.
And to think that there's something out 

2185
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:16,030
there that's 10 feet bigger than that.
Well,

2186
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,740
a killer whale can eat that things liver
without thinking about it in half.

2187
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,790
And killer whales,
just a dolphin.

2188
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:25,570
It's so weird to think that that thing 
has dominance over that thing.

2189
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,430
It is,
but there's just so much smarter.

2190
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:29,860
It's not even close.
There's so much more agile,

2191
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:32,030
so much smarter.
For how often.

2192
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:34,360
What?
This is a seven year old,

2193
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:35,350
what do they call that?
Oh,

2194
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,400
Greenland.
Shark.

2195
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:37,870
Yeah.
They think isn't.

2196
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:41,080
Wasn't that one of the speculations of 
what the Loch ness monster was?

2197
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:44,410
I think it was some sort of a landlocked
green or not.

2198
01:32:44,411 --> 01:32:45,244
Landlord wouldn't have been in the lock.
Now the thing was the lock because it 

2199
01:32:47,981 --> 01:32:50,550
was trapped because the law is used to 
be connected to.

2200
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:54,700
That was a twig that was terrific.
Woodman,

2201
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:57,100
or it could be like a sturgeon or some 
shit like that.

2202
01:32:57,101 --> 01:33:02,101
Like there was one of.
One of those was a lake champlain or one

2203
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:05,950
of those surgeons are huge.
Sturgeons are crazy.

2204
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,070
That's another dynamic alligator.
Gar.

2205
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:11,980
You seen those things?
My friends went fishing for them.

2206
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:13,780
Yeah.
They haven't made Texas.

2207
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:16,500
You can catch them in Texas.
Those things are bizarre.

2208
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:18,190
I don't think you're noodling for those 
things.

2209
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:22,600
That's another thing.
It's hundreds of millions of years old,

2210
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:24,400
right?
I mean that would be.

2211
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,680
I'd love to go take my friends and just 
go.

2212
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:28,870
Newland sometimes sounds kind of creepy 
or girlfriend.

2213
01:33:28,871 --> 01:33:29,920
Be like,
what noodling.

2214
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,833
Oh,
for catfish,

2215
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,653
you get accidentally get turtle.
Sometimes they're snapping turtles and 

2216
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:38,470
bite your arm off is Gary's.
I feel fucking.

2217
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,540
We just break your arm in half.
Probably.

2218
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:41,880
Fuck you up.
I mean,

2219
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,540
I'm sure dudes are probably lost 
fingers.

2220
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,090
Snapping Turtle.
Those.

2221
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,060
What's that?
Yeah.

2222
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:49,570
Actually I googled that and the snapping
turtle incidents popped up.

2223
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:50,893
Guys losing their hands.
Don't show me this because that's like 

2224
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:55,783
razors.
They're like two razors that go garden 

2225
01:33:58,310 --> 01:34:00,700
sheers.
Taking your fucking arm off.

2226
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,530
Oh,
what?

2227
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:06,100
How often have you encountered workers?
I've never seen an Orca.

2228
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,001
Really?
No,

2229
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:07,691
not.
No.

2230
01:34:07,691 --> 01:34:10,390
I mean not other than two worlds.
Kidnapping of them.

2231
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:12,220
Foxy world.
Yeah.

2232
01:34:12,221 --> 01:34:13,054
I'm with Ya.

2233
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:17,200
I just don't understand.
I mean,

2234
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,840
I guess I understand because I was a kid
once and I went there,

2235
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:20,674
but I don't understand how a rational,
logical thinking adult could take their 

2236
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:29,290
kids to see world after all the 
information that's out there about,

2237
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:30,753
about the social behaviors,
about how smart these animals are about 

2238
01:34:34,751 --> 01:34:36,760
how gotten to a lot of people.
Unfortunately,

2239
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:39,760
I agree with you if you did get the 
information,

2240
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:42,160
but a lot of people just don't know.
They think,

2241
01:34:42,161 --> 01:34:43,270
well they're.
They're fed.

2242
01:34:43,271 --> 01:34:45,050
They're healthy.
Yeah.

2243
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:46,000
They don't.
Yeah.

2244
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,030
I got in this battle with and look,
I'm no scientist.

2245
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,060
I debate people all the time,
but I'm no scientist obviously.

2246
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:55,690
I just,
I think I have a pretty good heart and I

2247
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:56,524
feel bad for animals that are up,
that need to travel a hundred miles a 

2248
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:00,074
day in their social pacts and they need 
to have interaction with other animals 

2249
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,910
and they need a certain amount of space.

2250
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:05,743
I mean,
imagine you think about solitary 

2251
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:10,460
confinement for a prison,
a prisoner who's,

2252
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:11,323
who's in,
who's in a room that's no wider than 

2253
01:35:14,271 --> 01:35:17,990
they are tall and maybe twice as twice 
as long as they are tall,

2254
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:18,860
you know,
and,

2255
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,660
and there's no interaction with other 
people.

2256
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:23,210
They go crazy.
Most people will come out of prisons and

2257
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:27,440
jails worse than they went in because of
this kind of thing that happens to them.

2258
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:30,770
But I think of being in there for 30 
years,

2259
01:35:30,771 --> 01:35:31,850
just wondering,
God,

2260
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,890
there's another whale and the other side
of that wall.

2261
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:36,250
Can I get some fish?
And I mean,

2262
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:38,810
you go nuts and you see these videos of 
that,

2263
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:41,110
the trainer that was killed,
um,

2264
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:42,590
and a trainer,
one trainer,

2265
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:45,620
luckily the guy was a great free diver 
and he lived through a,

2266
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:48,440
basically an attack by an Orca.
And the thing he knew,

2267
01:35:48,441 --> 01:35:50,420
he wanted to get over to that wall and 
he went,

2268
01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:52,940
Nope,
I'm not gonna play with you and I'm just

2269
01:35:52,941 --> 01:35:54,650
going to keep pulling you down and 
pulling you down.

2270
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:58,340
And the guy was good enough freedom to 
be able to know,

2271
01:35:58,341 --> 01:35:59,780
okay,
I've got to conserve my energy.

2272
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:00,853
I gotta bring my heart rate down.
I'm going to have to hold my breath 

2273
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:05,450
against my will when I don't know what's
going to happen.

2274
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:09,020
A friend of mine used to work at marine 
land in Canada.

2275
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:12,170
My friend would fill,
filled demars and he was an Orca trainer

2276
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,273
and you know,
and he's trying to get marine land 

2277
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:17,600
closed down.
There was this big lawsuit with them and

2278
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:20,510
he's been involved in a lawsuit with 
them for over five years now.

2279
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:21,613
I was just hanging out with him in 
Toronto and he was a Walrus trainer and 

2280
01:36:25,851 --> 01:36:27,830
this is Walrus that he was taken care 
of.

2281
01:36:27,831 --> 01:36:30,200
It's the only one that's left there that
survived.

2282
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,720
And marine land is like slowly going 
bankrupt.

2283
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:35,810
The guy who was the original owner is 
now quickly go bankrupt.

2284
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:38,030
That's why it's so dark,
man.

2285
01:36:38,031 --> 01:36:40,790
The whole,
the whole business is so dark because,

2286
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,170
you know,
a lot of them say,

2287
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,060
oh,
we won't take any,

2288
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:46,610
you know,
orcas are dolphins from captivity,

2289
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:50,690
but they'll get them from people that 
stole them in the wild and they,

2290
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:51,740
they,
uh,

2291
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:52,640
breed,
you know,

2292
01:36:52,641 --> 01:36:54,320
I think there's no more breeding a lot 
in America.

2293
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:55,173
Yeah.
But they'll get them from someone that 

2294
01:36:56,091 --> 01:36:59,590
bred them in Canada or Russia or China 
or wherever,

2295
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:01,670
someplace where there's not as many 
rules.

2296
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:02,900
You know,
John Lilly,

2297
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,810
who was the guy who actually invented 
the isolation tank,

2298
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:06,883
is a,
he was a pioneer in interspecies 

2299
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:09,860
communication,
which is a,

2300
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:12,770
it's a weird field.
He was a scientist.

2301
01:37:12,771 --> 01:37:13,604
That was also.
He took like extreme liberties with his 

2302
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,400
scientific research,
took a lot of acid,

2303
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:20,234
gave asset to dolphins,
did a lot of dolphin research in the 

2304
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:25,640
flotation tank,
did a lot of really,

2305
01:37:25,641 --> 01:37:26,750
really wacky shit.

2306
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:27,583
But he believed that one day dolphins,
we're gonna have a seat in the United 

2307
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:32,383
Nations.
He believes we're going to be able to 

2308
01:37:32,571 --> 01:37:33,404
communicate with dolphins and that 
dolphins were going to be recognized as 

2309
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:37,693
water people.
He thought they were going to be 

2310
01:37:38,931 --> 01:37:41,390
literally the thought there was smartest
human beings.

2311
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:42,224
Amazing.
If we could figure out how to 

2312
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:45,860
communicate with them,
they would have the same rights as human

2313
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:47,510
beings.
Yeah.

2314
01:37:47,511 --> 01:37:49,630
And Guy was a genius.
I mean,

2315
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:52,580
just he and I,
I agree with them.

2316
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:55,070
I think there's just a level of 
communication.

2317
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:58,530
There's a way that they have of 
communicating that we don't understand,

2318
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,620
but it's super complex,
very of their own dialects.

2319
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:02,803
They,
they,

2320
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:06,090
they have this crazy social code that 
mean they,

2321
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:07,223
they have something like incredibly 
dynamic about their environment and 

2322
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:11,334
their,
their,

2323
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,190
their,
their,

2324
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,530
you know,
their social groups.

2325
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,450
To be,
uh,

2326
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,760
to be able to speak a language you need 
to know,

2327
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:19,140
like 150 words.

2328
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:21,730
There was a dolphin that new like 700 
words,

2329
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:22,910
300 words,
I don't know,

2330
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,420
like 100 commands.
Standard human words.

2331
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:28,100
You know how many dolphin words we know?
Zero.

2332
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,900
A fucking clue.
We have no idea.

2333
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:33,990
We don't know what the fuck they're 
saying,

2334
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:38,991
but they're so goddamn stupid.
Fucking stop giving me macro level.

2335
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:41,140
They're like,
they don't know,

2336
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:41,993
were making fun of them for 100 years.
I don't think they know what to do with 

2337
01:38:44,311 --> 01:38:45,144
them.
Well,

2338
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:48,420
one of the things that Phil was working 
with was there's a group,

2339
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:50,610
what was that group that where they're 
trying to,

2340
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,623
they're going to create a boundary out 
in the ocean and slowly released these 

2341
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:59,690
dolphins and orcas out into this 
boundary and then you know,

2342
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,533
and keep feeding them,
but then slowly released them out open 

2343
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:04,290
ocean pens.
Yeah.

2344
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,360
They're talking about doing that 
possibly,

2345
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,613
and that would be a way for people to 
actually experience it because the idea 

2346
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:13,830
is that you and I,
I had a debate with his trainer.

2347
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,120
I watched blackfish and it just freaked 
me out and of course it's.

2348
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,190
There's probably a lot of confirmation 
bias.

2349
01:39:20,191 --> 01:39:23,820
There's probably some information in 
there that is not totally unbiased.

2350
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:24,654
Right.
Obviously they're trying to make a 

2351
01:39:25,321 --> 01:39:26,970
point,
but this woman was.

2352
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,610
She talked to all the different trainers
and stuff.

2353
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,313
I got in contact,
a guy got in contact with me that was a 

2354
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:34,260
trainer and he said,
Kelly,

2355
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,440
the whole movie is Bs.
I think.

2356
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,060
I believe this guy was actually in the 
movie.

2357
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:40,230
He's like,
it was all bs.

2358
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:44,400
Orcas live longer in,
in captivity in indeed they do.

2359
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:45,234
In the wild.
He told me that orcas haven't been in 

2360
01:39:48,421 --> 01:39:51,120
captivity as long as they live yet,
so we don't know that.

2361
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,100
So that's completely a lie.
It's.

2362
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:56,910
He has no idea if that's true.
He said they're more healthy.

2363
01:39:56,911 --> 01:39:58,980
He told me all these things and I just 
finally went,

2364
01:39:58,981 --> 01:40:00,150
this guy's just full of shit.

2365
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,830
I Dunno,
I,

2366
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,390
I can't buy what he's telling me.
And He.

2367
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:06,180
But he said I'm a trainer.
I've been a trainer for it.

2368
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:09,480
I looked him up and biased because 
that's what makes his living exactly.

2369
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:13,010
And I know some dolphin trainers and I 
actually went to seaworld a few times in

2370
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,863
Australia.
I used to know a few of the trainers 

2371
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:15,684
back in the late nineties and I went 
there a few times when I'm with the 

2372
01:40:16,921 --> 01:40:18,750
dolphins.
The first day I was there,

2373
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,740
one of the things I asked him was like,
do they?

2374
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,580
Well these guys ever get set free and 
right.

2375
01:40:23,581 --> 01:40:24,990
Then I could feel a little pull back.
You know,

2376
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:27,660
like straight away I could feel like 
maybe,

2377
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:29,820
and I released my slaves.
Yeah,

2378
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:30,654
I felt a little uncomfortable with keep 
asking questions because it is their 

2379
01:40:32,551 --> 01:40:33,384
livelihood and I had a respect for that 
and I know that all these trainers love 

2380
01:40:36,121 --> 01:40:37,230
these animals.
They really,

2381
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:38,064
truly,
probably loved them more than most 

2382
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,540
people.
Um,

2383
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,510
but that doesn't make it right at all.
Um,

2384
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:45,503
and there are probably some animals that
can handle being in a zoo or they're 

2385
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:49,190
happy.
They're giraffes,

2386
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:50,820
giraffes,
and a bit about that,

2387
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:53,950
that just walking around going on was no
lions,

2388
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:54,851
Kangaroos,
you know,

2389
01:40:54,851 --> 01:40:55,684
they get fed well,
they don't really need to migrate 

2390
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,410
Predator that's going after them.
There's,

2391
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:02,470
I mean they let babies feed giraffes at 
the zoo.

2392
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,040
Yeah.
Because there's so calm.

2393
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,190
My friend has a draft in Malibu.
Really?

2394
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:07,603
Your friend as a giraffe has a draft.
How ballers your friends fucking 

2395
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,470
awesome.
And bitches come over your house.

2396
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:12,304
You got to right?
They bought it for like 30 grand or 20 

2397
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:15,480
grand.
Yeah,

2398
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:18,010
his Ferrari got a bunch of that.
That's my giraffe.

2399
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:18,873
They got some emus and the mind inside 
our chef will be cooking for you or 

2400
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,653
we'll fly to Jamaica.
My private jet motherfuckers got a 

2401
01:41:25,271 --> 01:41:28,210
giraffe can be poor and they got a 
winery.

2402
01:41:28,211 --> 01:41:29,380
They got a giraffe.
They got.

2403
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:31,200
He's got his own winery.
Yeah.

2404
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,610
Their family has like all this acres,
but anyways,

2405
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:34,780
this draft,
super cool.

2406
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,450
He come up and eat at her house in 
Malibu,

2407
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:38,313
Malibu Hill.

2408
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,920
It's called Malibu wine wine or Malibu 
winery or something.

2409
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:42,873
Man.
Wake up with a mountain lion eating 

2410
01:41:43,451 --> 01:41:45,070
lunch around.
I know they got to watch out.

2411
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:48,610
There's a mountain lion that killed 11 
alpacas up there.

2412
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,950
My friend lives in Topanga Canyon and 
he,

2413
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:51,813
he,
uh,

2414
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:53,103
he came home one day or one night a 
mountain lion got into his pig pen or 

2415
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:03,640
pen or something Kinda ugly.
There's a lot of them were talking about

2416
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:07,020
that anymore and it had to figure out 
like he had this,

2417
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:07,873
the way he had his thing,
it couldn't climb up the fencing or 

2418
01:42:10,781 --> 01:42:14,020
break under it.
It had tried apparently the thing new to

2419
01:42:14,021 --> 01:42:19,000
climb up this tree and drop from like 12
feet or 15 feet down into the pin.

2420
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:19,990
What's.
Yeah,

2421
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:22,480
yeah.
It had to climb this tree he had.

2422
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:25,150
He has cameras and stuff.
He figured it out.

2423
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,193
Figured it out.

2424
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:28,500
Yeah.
Fuck those things man.

2425
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:30,403
You know,
I went to muscle bay and in South 

2426
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,633
Africa,
so I was interested to do one of those 

2427
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:38,080
shark dive feeding tours.
I thought I'll go check it out.

2428
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,213
Got there,
get on the boat and you go out and you 

2429
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:41,404
don't want to.
I didn't want to bring my own wetsuit 

2430
01:42:42,011 --> 01:42:43,840
because I didn't want all this fish 
slime all over it.

2431
01:42:43,841 --> 01:42:44,674
You know what I mean?
So like I don't want to go back to 

2432
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:48,100
surfing the next day at some back of 
Jeffery's bay.

2433
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,280
Smelled like fish.
Yeah.

2434
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,280
And uh,
so um,

2435
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,110
get on the boat,
go out there and where they feed them,

2436
01:42:56,111 --> 01:42:58,990
there's like these couple of little rock
islands that stick up right there.

2437
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:01,060
And they'd just parked the boat.
As soon as they parked the boat,

2438
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,170
boom.
The sharks are on you.

2439
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:03,513
Sharks are pretty inquisitive anyways.
Even when I've been on boats out in the 

2440
01:43:06,641 --> 01:43:07,840
ocean,
fishing or diving,

2441
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,060
wasn't Papa New Guinea one time.

2442
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:10,893
We pulled up everywhere.
We anchored immediately be three to 

2443
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:14,830
five,
maybe more sharks on the boat.

2444
01:43:14,831 --> 01:43:16,870
Did you come up from the deep check out?
What is that?

2445
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:17,893
And to kind of disappeared.
Then they're probably watching because 

2446
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:20,920
they can,
they know what's going on.

2447
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,473
But the great whites pop up.
I think that day we saw about eight or 

2448
01:43:25,421 --> 01:43:28,420
10 great whites,
different sizes and ages and whatever.

2449
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:31,360
And uh,
what about 500 yards away?

2450
01:43:31,361 --> 01:43:35,590
There were guys surfing and I was like,
this is fucking weird man.

2451
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:39,280
Like there's no way I'd be surfing and 
these guys surf there every day.

2452
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,370
And then there's a couple other spots.
A couple of friends of mine like grew up

2453
01:43:42,371 --> 01:43:46,330
in that area and they surf these reefs 
that are like right back where we came a

2454
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:49,570
mile a mile from there and the boat just
on just on the outside of this harbor.

2455
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:51,453
And

2456
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,713
there's kind kinda two ways of thinking.
Like number one thing that bothers me 

2457
01:43:57,081 --> 01:43:59,300
with it is that dish,
like sharks know where they got,

2458
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,550
they got a meal,
sharks,

2459
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:03,403
they tagged sharks,
they know they come back to a hunting 

2460
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:05,654
place where they got a seal the year 
before or whatever and they're there at 

2461
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:09,290
the same time.
You know,

2462
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:10,820
they're,
they're the same month or whatever.

2463
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,120
So like September,
October,

2464
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:16,460
they're like here on the coast of 
California.

2465
01:44:16,461 --> 01:44:17,110
Internal.
Yeah.

2466
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:21,140
And then they go down to Guadalupe 
Island and then then they go out about a

2467
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:21,983
thousand miles off the coast and they 
believe they breed out there and then a 

2468
01:44:24,021 --> 01:44:24,854
lot of the females will go to Hawaii in 
the males that come back and kind of do 

2469
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:28,610
that route,
pick up the coast.

2470
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:30,560
But they,
they.

2471
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,440
The craziest thing about these animals,
they,

2472
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:33,303
they know how to just free swim.
Like even if I'm swimming on the 

2473
01:44:37,911 --> 01:44:39,740
surface,
I got to like put my head up and go,

2474
01:44:39,741 --> 01:44:40,550
okay,
where's the beach?

2475
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:41,990
Whereas the,
you know which direction I'm going.

2476
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:43,123
Imagine like they can just swim out in 
the ocean and find each other thousand 

2477
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:49,160
miles from shore and breed out in the 
middle of nowhere.

2478
01:44:49,161 --> 01:44:51,250
How do they,
how do they do that and they all know to

2479
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:56,260
get to this place.
You can imagine like fish smell.

2480
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:01,510
Imagine how bad shark pussy smells like 
real distinct.

2481
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:02,363
I don't know.
I mean animals have crazy smells each 

2482
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:06,404
other when they're breeding in.
Oregon knows that there's a liver in 

2483
01:45:08,481 --> 01:45:09,314
that great white and he's gonna smash it
and eat the liver out of that and leave 

2484
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:14,210
the shark.
How they smell that.

2485
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:18,760
That's what all Alpha males like in the 
packs,

2486
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,650
when they kill a thing,
the Alpha male always eats to deliver.

2487
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,710
Wow.
It's the most nutrient dense Oregon.

2488
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:26,120
Yeah.
Well the.

2489
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,630
So what I don't like is that sharks I 
believe are equating,

2490
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:30,770
okay,
I see a boat,

2491
01:45:30,771 --> 01:45:33,080
I see a person,
whatever that thing is,

2492
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:34,760
and he's got food,
right?

2493
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:36,420
I just don't like that equation.
It's,

2494
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:40,700
it sucks.
And all these shark week's and stuff,

2495
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:42,500
they're all filming off of Cape Town and
they're,

2496
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:43,493
they're,
they're.

2497
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,360
I think they're educating the sharks 
that,

2498
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:47,210
like you said,
human,

2499
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:48,044
it's not fear,
it's just not necessarily the person's 

2500
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:51,224
food,
but they have food and if they don't 

2501
01:45:51,831 --> 01:45:52,664
give it,
it's like a spear fisherman shooting a 

2502
01:45:53,471 --> 01:45:54,560
fish.
You don't give up.

2503
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:56,330
Your fish will bite you sometimes.
Well,

2504
01:45:56,331 --> 01:45:57,164
you know,
that's the case in Kodiak Island with 

2505
01:45:58,491 --> 01:45:59,324
grizzly bears.
They said the grizzly bears have gotten 

2506
01:46:01,011 --> 01:46:05,030
so used to the sound of a gunshot,
meaning a deer's dead.

2507
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:05,923
Oh,
they'll look towards the sound of a 

2508
01:46:07,251 --> 01:46:08,420
gunshot.
Yeah.

2509
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:09,830
There's no.
So they hear a gunshot.

2510
01:46:09,831 --> 01:46:11,810
If someone shot a moose or someone shot 
a deer,

2511
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:13,380
that means that the dinner bill.
Yeah.

2512
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:17,380
So they run towards gunshot sounds.
You know,

2513
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:22,670
there's an island up in the Aleutians 
that has a bunch of Caribou on it.

2514
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:24,010
You know about them,
you know,

2515
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:25,270
and no bears.
Yeah.

2516
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:26,410
Yeah.
I was going to go home,

2517
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,253
my friend Adam Adam Green tree that 
we're just talking about a shot that a 

2518
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:33,730
water buffalo about my head just shot a 
giant Moose and a grizzly bear stolen.

2519
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:35,960
No,
in the Yukon last week.

2520
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:37,430
Wow.
Not even last week.

2521
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:38,264
Three days ago.
It might be still in his instagram 

2522
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:40,844
story,
but they took some meal eating that 

2523
01:46:43,401 --> 01:46:45,260
thing right now.
Will the bear buried it?

2524
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:48,660
Buried it buried a jog and fucking 
magic?

2525
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,610
Well,
it's an enormous bear.

2526
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,190
It's a bear in the Yukon.
So you talked about and bear.

2527
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,001
Yeah,
easily.

2528
01:46:54,001 --> 01:46:57,990
11 foot bear.
So this bear buried his entire moves and

2529
01:46:57,991 --> 01:47:00,470
it's all fucking huge.
Moves.

2530
01:47:00,471 --> 01:47:03,820
Like an 1800 try moving that moose one 
foot.

2531
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,793
Yeah.
This bay or just picked it up and dug 

2532
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:06,600
it?
Yeah,

2533
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:11,600
like a front loader or one of those 
cranes just digs foundations for houses.

2534
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,743
They just like,
like the meat to rotten and they grind 

2535
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:15,174
it well,
they also want to cover it so the birds 

2536
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:18,840
don't find it and then nothing else can 
see it.

2537
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:22,920
So they did giant.
They'll cover the Moose and the Gi.

2538
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:26,610
He just decided it was his and so they 
were terrified.

2539
01:47:26,611 --> 01:47:29,280
When they got there they found the Moose
was covered.

2540
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:31,620
They knew it was a grizzly that did it 
because it was so big.

2541
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,850
So they just took some of the meat and 
ran pleasure.

2542
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,693
So primal,
because they can only do so much at a 

2543
01:47:37,471 --> 01:47:38,940
time,
but why would you even take any?

2544
01:47:38,941 --> 01:47:39,774
I just get the fuck out of.
I mean nothing comes back or smells you 

2545
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:45,610
look at.
That's the moose that shot size,

2546
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:48,270
that fucking thing.
I mean that is a massive moves.

2547
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:50,880
A friend of mine got a moose last year,
but he's got photos.

2548
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:55,410
Go to the photo of what he got out of 
the Moose from the bear.

2549
01:47:55,411 --> 01:47:56,940
He got a bag.
A small

2550
01:47:56,970 --> 01:48:00,410
bag might be that.

2551
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,850
What does it say?
This is not my kid anymore.

2552
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,200
Yeah,
click on that.

2553
01:48:05,201 --> 01:48:06,960
You can see the video like play that

2554
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:09,410
very the whole mood.
Come on,

2555
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,680
look at this whole booth is buried.
Oh my gosh.

2556
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:16,080
That's my.
Are you sure it wasn't a skunk ape.

2557
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:16,941
The detail.
Look at that.

2558
01:48:16,941 --> 01:48:17,310
Look,
look,

2559
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:21,070
look,
okay.

2560
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:22,040
I don't like this.

2561
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:27,840
I would feel like we got the fuck out 
here.

2562
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:31,230
Plus their bow bowhunting.
Don't even have guns.

2563
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:34,200
No guns.
You ever hear that story of the guy who,

2564
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:36,000
the kid who was getting attacked by the 
bear,

2565
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:39,180
the grizzly running down a hill and his 
dad was looking up with a bow.

2566
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,430
You hear the story?
No.

2567
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,630
You got to find this story.
It's so sick.

2568
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:45,150
The Dad was looking at,
the guy decides to go up this Ridge,

2569
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:47,160
this kid,
he's like 25 years,

2570
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:47,994
20 year old kid or whatever,
and he's going up the ridge and he sees 

2571
01:48:50,971 --> 01:48:52,890
a couple bear cubs or whatever.
And then,

2572
01:48:52,891 --> 01:48:55,410
oh no,
there's mom think comes after him.

2573
01:48:55,411 --> 01:48:57,750
Just charge and he comes running back 
down the hill,

2574
01:48:57,751 --> 01:48:58,584
but he straightened line with the,
with the bear that dad is looking at 

2575
01:49:01,961 --> 01:49:02,850
him,
pulled back,

2576
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:05,430
ready to let,
let an arrow fly.

2577
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,890
And the kids exactly in line with the 
bear.

2578
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:11,100
Oh my God.
And as the bears like getting to him,

2579
01:49:11,310 --> 01:49:12,143
the kids kind of sidesteps and the dad 
lets it fly and it hits the bear in the 

2580
01:49:14,401 --> 01:49:18,780
heart and the baird falls on.
The kid starts ripping at him and dies.

2581
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:23,230
Whoa.
Whoa.

2582
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:25,400
Outdoor life.
September 25,

2583
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,420
2:37.
So yeah.

2584
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:28,250
Wow.

2585
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:31,300
Elk Hunting?
Yeah,

2586
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:35,090
Naomi pig got him and started tearing at
him and died on him.

2587
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:36,380
Jesus Christ,

2588
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:43,690
I passed my dad and I saw an arrow fly 
by my leg about two feet away.

2589
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,600
Dad kept it together.
Tell you what.

2590
01:49:46,601 --> 01:49:49,450
There's some serious target panic there.
Yeah.

2591
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:53,560
You better go charging at you and your 
sons in front of you.

2592
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,903
Oh my God.
I hate to wrap this up and I got to get 

2593
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:59,020
out of here.
It's already 6:30.

2594
01:49:59,050 --> 01:49:59,883
I had a question for you please.
I was talking about this with a couple 

2595
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:03,154
of friends of mine that you are exposed 
to probably more information and people 

2596
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:12,100
and and all that and more walks of life 
than maybe anybody in the world.

2597
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:13,243
You realize that everything about that 
because you get such a diverse group of 

2598
01:50:17,231 --> 01:50:18,064
people to come talk to you from 
politicians to chemists and scientists 

2599
01:50:21,461 --> 01:50:25,720
and athletes and you just know so much 
information about so many topics.

2600
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,030
It's really no light scattering.

2601
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:30,370
Little for you know a little bit about 
everything.

2602
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:31,303
Sort of like sometimes.
Sometimes I don't remember anyone being 

2603
01:50:34,001 --> 01:50:34,834
humble,
but I mean I think it's cool because 

2604
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:38,170
you're just in this sort of,
in this,

2605
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,633
you're in this place where now that 
information is so readily available to 

2606
01:50:42,951 --> 01:50:45,550
you firsthand and definitely have 
learned a lot,

2607
01:50:45,551 --> 01:50:48,040
but what's interesting is that this was 
never the plan.

2608
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:52,300
This is all just complete happenstance 
and good fortune.

2609
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,253
I mean there's this whole thing just 
started out talking shit with comedian 

2610
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:55,800
friends.
Yeah.

2611
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:56,633
Yeah.
And then slowly but surely someone was 

2612
01:50:57,671 --> 01:50:58,504
like,
I want to go on.

2613
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:58,961
I'm like,
okay,

2614
01:50:58,961 --> 01:51:00,400
come on.
And then you know,

2615
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:01,234
I got like Anthony Bourdain was one of 
the first guests that was like a guest 

2616
01:51:03,971 --> 01:51:06,310
guest.
And then were you buddies with him?

2617
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:07,144
Did you become friends?
I was friends with him and sad thing 

2618
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:10,750
it's fucking beyonce.

2619
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:11,471
But like,
yeah.

2620
01:51:11,471 --> 01:51:13,570
So your experience now is your flow 
state.

2621
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:17,110
It's just like it's just happening.
And is it you enjoy it?

2622
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:19,030
You know,
I love it.

2623
01:51:19,031 --> 01:51:19,864
I love watching into it.
I look forward to meeting interesting 

2624
01:51:23,231 --> 01:51:24,064
people and meeting people like you and 
people like Neil degrasse Tyson or 

2625
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:29,314
Graham Hancock or there's so many 
different people that can come on and 

2626
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,353
talk about so many different fascinating
things that maybe a lot of people just 

2627
01:51:37,001 --> 01:51:39,280
weren't exposed to the information for 
that.

2628
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:40,513
Um,
just to wrap up that foot thing because 

2629
01:51:42,551 --> 01:51:43,870
I didn't enter,
it'll be super short.

2630
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:47,590
I got a second surgery in February,
put me off for about six weeks.

2631
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:49,173
I for about six weeks and I started 
getting good again and then I taught 

2632
01:51:52,391 --> 01:51:53,224
because my foot was so tight.
I did like a turf toe terror on the 

2633
01:51:55,091 --> 01:51:58,570
bottom and I ripped the plantar 
fasciitis or whatever.

2634
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:00,610
So I've been fighting that,
but I'm,

2635
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,430
I'm right back now.
I'm going to start competing in December

2636
01:52:03,431 --> 01:52:04,264
again.
Nice.

2637
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:05,530
Um,
so yeah,

2638
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:07,530
I wanted to go to one of those live 
where,

2639
01:52:07,570 --> 01:52:09,430
where's.
Is there anyone live around here?

2640
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:12,240
Any.
Any competition that I could see a.

2641
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,470
not really around here.
What would it have to go?

2642
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:15,201
Hawaii?
Yeah,

2643
01:52:15,201 --> 01:52:18,100
come to Hawaii when I went to the second
week of December.

2644
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:19,060
Second Week?
Yeah.

2645
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:21,070
It's in between.
It's in between your fcs.

2646
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:21,953
I,
there's actually,

2647
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:24,490
there's actually a billet door that week
in Hawaii.

2648
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:25,730
Honolulu.
That's right.

2649
01:52:25,731 --> 01:52:27,230
Yeah.
A friend of my card.

2650
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:29,680
Oh,
I forget the card.

2651
01:52:29,681 --> 01:52:31,570
My friend Dustin Barca is fighting on it
though,

2652
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:32,433
man.
I was planning on seeing fate or versus 

2653
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:36,950
Ryan Bader.
It was going to be at the bay door.

2654
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:38,680
Is that what happened in?
Yeah,

2655
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:40,660
on the 26th.
But now,

2656
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,070
um,
what is it?

2657
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:42,904
November?
No,

2658
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:44,980
December 26.
Well,

2659
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:47,060
whatever the date is,
there's a UFC now.

2660
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:49,100
Bummer.
Yeah.

2661
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:52,160
I wanted to see him live,
but there's a Bella tour.

2662
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:53,003
I mean,
I don't know if you're.

2663
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:56,120
Are you contractually obligated to not 
go to those now?

2664
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:57,240
I can go.
Yeah.

2665
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,310
Can Go.
So there was one that week and the.

2666
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:02,330
We have a surf contest at pipeline.
Who's on that belt or card?

2667
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:07,430
Because Michael Chandler,
the main is Valerie laterno verse.

2668
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:10,760
I can't say her name.
Mcfarland.

2669
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:11,970
You can say it.
Go ahead.

2670
01:53:12,030 --> 01:53:13,800
I don't know how to pronounce that.

2671
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:16,910
Lima,
Lima,

2672
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:18,800
farlane and Lima lay.
Mcfarland.

2673
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:19,790
She must be how,
what?

2674
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:20,733
In what?
We should probably the local and the 

2675
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:23,190
local car.
Machida,

2676
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:26,720
I can't figure out this website,
man.

2677
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:27,554
Liotta was great guy when he was 
undefeated and it was a bad 

2678
01:53:30,801 --> 01:53:32,210
motherfucker.
That's a good fight.

2679
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:34,430
Even gracie and Ed Ruth.
Ooh,

2680
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:35,680
that's a good fight.
King.

2681
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:36,920
Oh,
and Liam mcgeary.

2682
01:53:36,921 --> 01:53:40,280
That's a good fight to Kona.
He's a friend of mine.

2683
01:53:40,281 --> 01:53:41,240
Kona.
Olivera Oh,

2684
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:42,950
okay.
He's a surfer guy.

2685
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:48,380
What a weird bell towards.
Got a very strange website.

2686
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:52,300
Yeah.
15th.

2687
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:53,210
Is this car?
This one.

2688
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:54,523
So that's the same week.
And what island is this surf contest on 

2689
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:57,600
a while?
Husein.

2690
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,421
Ms Dot Lou.
Oh,

2691
01:53:58,421 --> 01:53:59,390
okay.
That's on the north shore.

2692
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:02,480
I'll send you a sincere for cat.
I'll tell you what days is running.

2693
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:03,610
Okay.
If you want to try.

2694
01:54:03,611 --> 01:54:04,760
If I can,
I wouldn't try.

2695
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:05,990
I really want to see one live.

2696
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:07,670
Yeah,
I think it would be cool to be there.

2697
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:08,533
He's probably won't compete,
but he'll probably do commentary for 

2698
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:12,110
Shane's.
Going to be here real soon.

2699
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:15,480
He's here the day of sober October.
November fifth show.

2700
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,900
He got me in here early.
You got you got me in.

2701
01:54:17,901 --> 01:54:19,280
I did that.
I don't drink,

2702
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,630
I don't drink much,
but I was like,

2703
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:24,970
I was in Paris that we tobar started and
I'll let you know,

2704
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:25,833
I'm just like going to my friend's 
restaurant every night and having a 

2705
01:54:27,291 --> 01:54:29,570
drink or two and stupid,
you know,

2706
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:33,440
and so I just feel so much better not 
having even a beer,

2707
01:54:33,441 --> 01:54:34,040
you know,
it's just,

2708
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:35,690
it's a good look.
I enjoyed it.

2709
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:39,680
Last year,
last year we did 15 days of hot yoga.

2710
01:54:39,681 --> 01:54:42,350
We had to do 15 hot yoga classes.
Ninety minute classes.

2711
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:43,850
Yeah.
That was kind of a pain in the ass.

2712
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,620
This year is way more of a pain in the 
ass.

2713
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:46,783
This year we're doing this crazy fitness
competition where we're wearing this my 

2714
01:54:49,431 --> 01:54:50,264
zone heart rate monitor and you get a 
certain amount of points for every 

2715
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:55,280
minute you're in,
you know,

2716
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,153
like 80 percent of your max heart rate.
Seventy percent of your max heart rates 

2717
01:54:59,410 --> 01:55:00,380
every day.
You're just,

2718
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:01,613
dude,
I worked out for five and a half hours 

2719
01:55:02,631 --> 01:55:04,670
today.
Five and a half hours.

2720
01:55:04,671 --> 01:55:05,504
I'm trying to kill my friend.
I served for five hours yesterday and 

2721
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:09,120
I'm not dead.
I just haven't served much later.

2722
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:10,490
I'm not bullshitting.
I worked for.

2723
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,010
Worked out for five people.
You're exaggerating.

2724
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:14,870
No,
it's documented.

2725
01:55:15,230 --> 01:55:18,440
I did.
Much of that is 913 points.

2726
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:21,030
How many shitting their pants right now?
How many?

2727
01:55:21,190 --> 01:55:22,060
Nine.
Twenty nine.

2728
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,600
Before I quit.
How many minutes?

2729
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:25,340
Do you know how many minutes today you 
were?

2730
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,660
Eighty percent heart rate or whatever 
hours.

2731
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:30,410
All those yellow hours this month?
Yes.

2732
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:31,313
No,
today.

2733
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:34,820
Today I was at ours at 80 percent of 
couple hours.

2734
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:36,940
More like three.
Wow.

2735
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:39,230
Because the reality is at 80 percent of 
my max heart rate,

2736
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:40,193
it had to be because 913 you get 240.
What's the per minute to end game is I 

2737
01:55:45,181 --> 01:55:46,014
win nobody.
I mean do you go do a triathlon 

2738
01:55:48,061 --> 01:55:50,940
afterwards?
I'm in fucking crazy shape right now.

2739
01:55:50,941 --> 01:55:51,774
I'll tell you that you are.
I may go on and I'm like freaking 

2740
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:54,930
ripped,
but I mean I've,

2741
01:55:55,010 --> 01:55:55,843
I've,
I've literally never been in better 

2742
01:55:56,851 --> 01:55:57,684
cardiovascular shape in my life when it 
works out for five and a half fucking 

2743
01:56:00,481 --> 01:56:02,100
hours today.
So what do you do?

2744
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:02,934
Anything with that besides just feel 
good like like just trying to get my 

2745
01:56:05,341 --> 01:56:07,500
belt.
Will we have a championship belt,

2746
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:08,363
like a wwe belt at the end of this 
intergalactic champion to sober October 

2747
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:13,283
and I'm just trying right now.
I'm trying to literally kill my friends 

2748
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:18,000
that are trying to compete you at me.

2749
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,013
I want,
I want them to regret getting into this 

2750
01:56:20,821 --> 01:56:21,654
competition with me because I don't 
think they totally understood how 

2751
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:26,550
fucking crazy I am.
And so this thing started heating up and

2752
01:56:26,551 --> 01:56:30,120
I told them I'm going to do 929 points 
everyday.

2753
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,160
Right now.
1,600

2754
01:56:32,161 --> 01:56:35,490
points ahead of second place.
Do you ever fast.

2755
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,400
Have you fasted fuckers?
No.

2756
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:38,130
No,
no.

2757
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:41,730
I've done intermittent fasting fast,
like 16 hours but never liked the master

2758
01:56:41,731 --> 01:56:43,460
cleanse for 10 days or so.
No.

2759
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:46,890
I like food too much,
but I do enjoy intermittent fasting.

2760
01:56:46,891 --> 01:56:50,130
I like to do 16 hours.
I've done like nine,

2761
01:56:50,131 --> 01:56:51,750
10 day fasts.
Master cleanse,

2762
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:53,363
but do that.
I recommend it just because you get all 

2763
01:56:56,251 --> 01:56:58,650
this stuff out of your colon that looks 
like your colon.

2764
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:02,340
It's like old poop and it real.
I swear to God,

2765
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,560
I came out of my body,
I thought I pooped out my colon.

2766
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:09,420
So it's like when you haven't eaten in 
like two days now,

2767
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:10,483
how much you shitting?
You still know that y'all used to poop 

2768
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,320
the poop everyday.
A little bit.

2769
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:14,520
Yeah.
Wow.

2770
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,710
That's crazy.
That's got to.

2771
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:18,270
This stuff comes out of your gut.
They call mucoid plaque.

2772
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:21,120
You can google that and it.
It is like 20,

2773
01:57:21,121 --> 01:57:21,954
30,
40 years of stuff built up from the 

2774
01:57:23,131 --> 01:57:23,964
mucus your body creates when it doesn't 
like what you're eating and that goes 

2775
01:57:27,121 --> 01:57:30,750
down and it gets stuck on this,
on the walls of your intestines and it's

2776
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:31,584
like tire rubber and you poop it out.
It looks exactly like the shape of your 

2777
01:57:35,161 --> 01:57:37,100
intestine.
I thought it was my intestines.

2778
01:57:37,101 --> 01:57:38,580
So you thought you should out part of 
your body.

2779
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:40,110
I did.
It was freaky.

2780
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:41,880
And how how good you feel and this is 
over.

2781
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:43,650
You look,
latency,

2782
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:45,120
pull it up,
pull it up.

2783
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:52,290
I didn't believe it was real and I got 
it and it's like weird flap.

2784
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,510
That is nuts.
Yeah.

2785
01:57:54,511 --> 01:57:57,820
I got something that does look like 
intestine.

2786
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,520
Yeah,
it looks like intestine dude.

2787
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:00,383
It's gross.
So that's what comes after your 

2788
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:05,570
nutrients.
Have to go through that to get Kiddo.

2789
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,593
How long?
Well maybe I'll do that right after I'm 

2790
01:58:07,501 --> 01:58:10,970
done with sober October.
When Google the master class,

2791
01:58:11,010 --> 01:58:13,380
because you're drinking a tea of like 
maple syrup,

2792
01:58:13,381 --> 01:58:15,150
lemon and Cayenne pepper for how many 
times?

2793
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,520
I kinda like it.
I did it for 10 days.

2794
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:18,570
Ten days.
No food.

2795
01:58:18,571 --> 01:58:20,040
Just that.
Whoa.

2796
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:20,963
Yeah,
but I got that stuff coming out after 

2797
01:58:22,861 --> 01:58:24,960
about five days because I was really 
aggressive with the.

2798
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:26,353
You do a salt water flush every day,
every morning and then you take this 

2799
01:58:29,611 --> 01:58:32,460
smooth move tea that makes you kind of 
like go to the bathroom.

2800
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:33,623
Well,
I'll tell you one thing that I had been 

2801
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:36,180
doing because I've been sweating so 
much.

2802
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:40,710
I videotaped one day the sweat puddles 
that are left in the jar.

2803
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:46,050
I watched that and then I set off my 
alarm fire alarm in my gym from my sweat

2804
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:47,373
and today it was so bad.
That was when you lapped the field of 

2805
01:58:49,631 --> 01:58:50,610
your friends?
Yeah.

2806
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:55,660
Today was so bad too because today I did
the longest that I've ever worked out,

2807
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:58,240
but um,
I know your nutrition is good too,

2808
01:58:58,241 --> 01:58:59,074
so I mean,
but you gotta be thinking about what's 

2809
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:01,570
going out in what you got to put back 
in.

2810
01:59:01,610 --> 01:59:06,610
That's one of the things I've been 
drinking water with electrolytes and I'm

2811
01:59:06,701 --> 01:59:11,701
adding salt.
I'm adding Himalayan salt to the water,

2812
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,920
but I may be added too much and when I 
talk about just forget diarrhea,

2813
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:19,123
not really diarrhea kids,
it's basically water coming out of my 

2814
01:59:23,411 --> 01:59:26,290
ass because it's,
I mean it would be like,

2815
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:28,250
I would feel it be like you don't pay it
all.

2816
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:29,083
Oh boom.
It was like opening flood gates and 

2817
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:33,730
gallons of water would come out of my 
ass.

2818
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:36,130
Most people should do that like once or 
twice a month.

2819
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:36,964
Two tables,
two teaspoons of salt in one liter of 

2820
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:41,060
water or a quarter water,
banging it.

2821
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:43,330
Your body sees it as food,
not as P,

2822
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:44,223
right?
It just means you have to stay home for 

2823
01:59:46,931 --> 01:59:48,280
that one.
I wasn't staying home.

2824
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:50,440
I would just jump off the treadmill for 
five minutes.

2825
01:59:50,441 --> 01:59:51,274
Take a volume is shit of water was 
basically water coming out of my 

2826
01:59:54,581 --> 01:59:57,190
asshole,
but it probably cleans up a lot.

2827
01:59:57,191 --> 01:59:58,660
Right.
It cleans.

2828
01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,590
It cleans you out.
Yeah.

2829
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:01,900
There was stuff.
Weird stuff floating around in there.

2830
02:00:01,930 --> 02:00:02,763
I didn't know what that was.
Maybe body uses so much energy for 

2831
02:00:04,541 --> 02:00:05,650
digestion.
Yeah,

2832
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:08,260
but I got these guys that fall in line 
to do water fast,

2833
02:00:08,261 --> 02:00:12,220
like every month and they're doing a 
five to 10 day water fast coming up this

2834
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:12,940
week.

2835
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:15,070
I'm not going to participate in that 
one,

2836
02:00:15,071 --> 02:00:16,930
but I want to do a fast soon.
So.

2837
02:00:16,931 --> 02:00:17,764
Great.
How much did you look forward to that 

2838
02:00:19,061 --> 02:00:20,700
drink,
that tea with the law?

2839
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:22,620
I mean if you're not.
I really enjoyed calories.

2840
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:23,680
Yeah,
really enjoyed it.

2841
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:25,450
It was a lot of weight.
I lost.

2842
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,650
Yeah.
I didn't weigh myself,

2843
02:00:26,651 --> 02:00:30,040
but I think I lost 10 to 12 pounds.
That's a lot.

2844
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:33,370
I really appreciated.
I was pretty sure I did,

2845
02:00:33,371 --> 02:00:34,880
but I was thin too,
you know.

2846
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:39,020
But then you build back at that first 
date I ate afterwards,

2847
02:00:39,021 --> 02:00:39,854
you know,
it was like the best food I ever had my 

2848
02:00:41,690 --> 02:00:42,560
gun,
you know,

2849
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:46,090
just like you've never deep 10 whole 
days of just the tea.

2850
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,290
Yeah.
Wow.

2851
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:47,940
And,
and uh,

2852
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:51,400
and a salt water flush every day and the
smooth move tea,

2853
02:00:51,401 --> 02:00:52,960
which I was doubling up on.
So I was,

2854
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:55,840
because I didn't have the full 14 days,
so I'm like I got to go fast.

2855
02:00:56,230 --> 02:00:57,740
But I was getting stomach cramps because
I was eating,

2856
02:00:57,850 --> 02:00:59,830
drinking too much of that tea.
I'll try that.

2857
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,050
Yeah,
I'll give that a shot.

2858
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:02,590
At least Google it and look and,
and,

2859
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:05,170
but when you can,
when you can abstain from food,

2860
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:06,033
it's,
it's like you could quit heroin or some 

2861
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:12,850
people are so addicted to food.
Look at people thing because of this.

2862
02:01:12,851 --> 02:01:15,760
Like I'm the amount of calories that I'm
consuming.

2863
02:01:15,761 --> 02:01:19,540
Like let me tell you how much I burned 
today because it's so goddamn insane.

2864
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:23,350
Today I burned.
I mean this doesn't even,

2865
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:27,570
it doesn't even seem real.
But I burned 4,217

2866
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:30,210
calories during this workout.
Yeah.

2867
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:32,710
That's a or you just circuiting the 
whole time,

2868
02:01:33,810 --> 02:01:37,360
ran the hills around two miles with my 
dog in the hills,

2869
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:40,430
which believe it or not,
you don't get many fucking points for it

2870
02:01:40,431 --> 02:01:41,264
because it's think sucks.
It's way harder than the other things 

2871
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:45,050
that I'm doing because it's basically 
straight up,

2872
02:01:45,051 --> 02:01:45,884
but I'm just trying to.

2873
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:50,950
I have a two year old golden retriever 
and he's got so much goddamn energy.

2874
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:54,110
He's the best,
but I got to wear his ass out.

2875
02:01:54,111 --> 02:01:54,944
Otherwise he annoys.
Everybody jumps up on people who just 

2876
02:01:56,811 --> 02:01:57,644
needs attention,
but when I run with them he's just 

2877
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:02,360
chill.
So I'll do two miles in the.

2878
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:05,750
What do you got here and just give you.
I'm going to plug my buddy sunlife.

2879
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:08,840
I love this stuff.
What is this one that's a dawn patrol.

2880
02:02:08,841 --> 02:02:11,720
It's like cold brew coffee,
coconut,

2881
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:14,300
a coconut cream,
coconut sugar.

2882
02:02:14,990 --> 02:02:17,550
Anyways,
you go into my time,

2883
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:20,650
but I do.
I go in there all the time in depth.

2884
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:21,620
Courageous.
I.

2885
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:22,900
They have great everything.
Yeah,

2886
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:25,100
just awesome.
I really live there.

2887
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,380
Sometimes they'll spend half the day 
there and get to my meals.

2888
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:32,230
Got Bone Broth to enbrel.
I love the bone broth that he.

2889
02:02:32,231 --> 02:02:34,160
It's like his Kahleel special style.

2890
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:34,671
Yeah.
Yeah.

2891
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:38,080
With the Cayenne pepper and that's 
fucking sensational.

2892
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:39,920
Was I saying,
oh,

2893
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:42,170
but that's not good for that many 
points.

2894
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:46,150
No system.
Not Gauging the going up hill.

2895
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:47,013
It's like it's more grinding.
It's like just if you get to 80 percent 

2896
02:02:51,321 --> 02:02:54,260
of your max heart rate and just grind.
You guys got money on this thing?

2897
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:56,130
No,
just the belt just to built.

2898
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:58,100
Yeah.
And bragging rights.

2899
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,180
Yeah.
You'll be like Khabib.

2900
02:02:59,181 --> 02:03:00,160
You're like,
where's my belt?

2901
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:03,710
Give me my belt.
Me By keeping me is number one bullshit.

2902
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:06,080
Send me a location.
Me Location.

2903
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,740
Kelly,
I'm glad we finally did this.

2904
02:03:07,790 --> 02:03:08,301
You too,
man.

2905
02:03:08,301 --> 02:03:09,110
Thanks a lot.
Yeah,

2906
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:10,880
it's been awesome.
Thanks you guys.

2907
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:15,290
We'll be back tomorrow folks.
We got to two tomorrow in my round earth

2908
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:16,124
shirt.
Thank you.

2909
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:17,460
Yeah,
round Earth Shill.

2910
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:18,913

Kyle Kalinsky will be here at one,
so see you tomorrow.

2912
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:25,873
Bye.
