1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,370
Yeah,
it makes me sad.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,233
It makes me sad if you'd tell me that 
you hear people saying anything bad 

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,860
about Gabriel,
like he's the,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,690
he's that guy like that.
When I think about people,

5
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:16,350
like there's a few comics that everybody
loves,

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,453
like Ron White's one of them.
If you say something bad about ron 

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,550
wagon,
posting them up.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,530
I can't talk to you.
Even agents love runway.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,373
Like he's changed their lives.
If you start talking shit about Ron 

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,810
White,
I don't have anything to say to you.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,570
Like there's no way.
There's no way.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,160
Unless he was really drunk.
I could see right way until this tore it

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,811
open.
Anthony.

14
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:40,440
He was like fucking 57 years old.
He got in a fistfight at some,

15
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,200
uh,
some bar because some woman was taking a

16
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,050
picture with him and the boyfriend 
didn't like it.

17
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,660
So the boyfriend was drunk.
She came over to Ron.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,493
Ron punched him in the face.
He now he has to have like a has to 

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,640
bring a cop with him everywhere he goes.
He goes,

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,460
he brings a copy of the truck.
He told me he brings a compliment.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,703
He's Kinda hire cops,
make sure he doesn't punch people or 

22
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:05,760
they don't punch him.
He's the best God would a good dude.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,713
I got this call from comedy central to 
come down and showcase at the Irvine 

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,733
Improv and I had to be spotless clean 
for 10 minutes and I go down and I 

25
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,334
really worked at it and I just pulled 
away some stuff and then they called me 

26
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:17,434
and they said,
you're not in it.

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,501
I'm like,
okay.

28
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,000
They go,
you will make the cut next year.

29
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,680
So I called Gabriel,
thank them.

30
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:22,980
He goes,
well,

31
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,990
what are you talking about?
You're not in it.

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,303
Give me five minutes.
And he calls back because you're doing 

33
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:27,510
it.

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,350
You're taping it.
Okay.

35
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,184
So the whole time I'm thinking,
I'm doing this seven minute tv set that 

36
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,650
they have the taping.
He pulled me over when he goes,

37
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,470
listen,
you call him crazy tonight.

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,970
I go,
but I've been working on this material.

39
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:39,930
He goes,
I don't give a fuck.

40
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,490
He goes,
I want you to go crazy.

41
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,660
He goes,
I'm going to pay for the show.

42
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,240
He goes,
I'm paying for it out of my pocket.

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,770
If it makes the cut,
it makes the cut or not.

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,643
It's for me.
I just wanted to me he paid for the 

45
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,540
episode that gets shot.
That's the only got picked up for six.

46
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,480
They shot seven because he wanted me to 
go off.

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,580
Oh Wow.
So at the end,

48
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,410
the whole day,
I'm thinking I'm going now.

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,760
That's sad that get down.
And he's like,

50
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,061
no,
no,

51
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:04,770
no,
you're doing fucking dirty shit.

52
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,471
And he goes,
I,

53
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,710
I planned it this way.
He goes,

54
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,990
I don't give a fuck what they tell you.
He goes,

55
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,540
I want you to work this way for a 
reason.

56
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,520
I brought it down here for a reason.
He goes,

57
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:16,500
worst case scenario,
you make the DVD,

58
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,230
you follow me.
Like he was like,

59
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:23,310
he fought for me to work dirty and 
they've got me on comedy central.

60
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,263
Wow.
It's just the feeling I always get from 

61
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:26,514
him.
Just he's just seems like a real good 

62
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:29,130
guy.
You know?

63
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,293
I,
I've never heard anybody say a bad word 

64
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:34,020
about Gabriel ever.
Well,

65
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,930
listen to this comics that know this and
you know this,

66
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,960
that the more you help out younger 
comics,

67
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,870
the better it is for you.
You learn,

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,360
you look at younger guys and you learn 
little things.

69
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,543
Sometimes I go to the comedy store,
I see a younger comics say something on 

70
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,600
stage.
Don't hire him because of that reason.

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,621
Like I was saying,
Hey,

72
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:55,020
what are you doing next Tuesday?
You want to the Ice House and whatever.

73
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,690
Just because something they do,
you know,

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,980
but it's also good for you.
You did

75
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,540
it for us,
you helped us out.

76
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,120
It made you a strong economic,
you know,

77
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,373
anybody knows that.
Helping other guys along the way is 

78
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,340
great.
Gabriel ride six deep.

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,440
You think you needs to ride six deep six
days before you go see Gabriel Lca,

80
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:18,200
guys.
Spanish songs and Mexican band.

81
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,770
Because he'll put you up.
Yeah,

82
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,690
he doesn't care.
That's beautiful.

83
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,280
You got to make a living.
Come on down.

84
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,443
That's beautiful.
There's not a whole lot of guys like 

85
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,430
that that.
No,

86
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,263
they'd be.
They'd be suspect that you're funnier 

87
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,760
than them,
but you're going to try this.

88
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,091
No,
no,

89
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:31,510
no,
no.

90
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,343
Yeah,
come on down and what do you want to 

91
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,144
eat?
You know,

92
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,690
can't worry about that or that,
but you can't.

93
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,390
The fund is in working with the best 
guys.

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,060
The Fun,
the fun is in,

95
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,000
in and also seeing all these different 
stages.

96
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,523
Like when you take a young guy on the 
road with you or when you see a young 

97
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,120
guy,
I do a really good set of the store.

98
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,263
You,
you recognize like those moments were 

99
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,670
when you were young and you were just 
starting to figure your material out and

100
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,504
you were just starting to figure out 
like how to really get to the heart of 

101
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,970
the matter quicker or what.
What's actually funny about this,

102
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,320
like what's clouding my judgment where I
can't figure out how to get this funny,

103
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,154
but occasionally these spark shine 
through and you have a killer bit and 

104
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:15,924
like in everybody knows like a young guy
who in the early months we'll have like 

105
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,200
one bit when you see that bed and go,
this motherfucker's funny.

106
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,230
Like he's saying some shit.
Like he might not have it right now with

107
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,470
this motherfucker's funny.
And when you see someone who's got that,

108
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,900
it makes you like really aware of that 
whole process,

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,953
you know,
the whole process of just getting your 

110
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:41,180
legs under you as a comic and doing it 
and you know,

111
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,014
and,
and when you're around people who are 

112
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,640
also doing that,
like it feeds off of it,

113
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,470
like you could stay hungry like deepened
to your,

114
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,323
your career just by continuing to create
material and continuing to be around 

115
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,080
other guys who are hungry.

116
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,423
And when you're doing that,
like one of the things that's going on 

117
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,364
in our little group that is so,
it's so dynamic is that everybody is 

118
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:07,630
hustling.
Everybody is doing a podcast.

119
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,930
Everybody's doing their standup.
Everybody's recording specials,

120
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,290
everybody's doing tours,
everybody's doing shit.

121
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,810
There's a lot going on.
And it's all new stuff.

122
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,480
You know,
like Ari,

123
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,593
he's got a new one.
He's doing an Austin if you're in 

124
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:21,970
Austin,
Texas next weekend,

125
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,583
uh,
he's doing his special at Cap City 

126
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,563
Comedy Club in Austin,
which is one of the best clubs on the 

127
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,840
planet.
And I don't think it's sold out.

128
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:33,520
I think there's a little bit of tickets 
left,

129
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,120
but probably gone soon,
but his new shit,

130
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,320
he's on fire.
This is.

131
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:40,780
This is the time to see him in ours.
Never been better.

132
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,300
He's never been better.
He's crazy.

133
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,940
He's crazy than the fucking.
That was beautiful.

134
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,200
That's why I love him because he's 
correct.

135
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,640
I can't judge them.
I just sit there,

136
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,620
listen to the conversation.
I always ask them,

137
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,240
you walk around New York with other 
teacher though,

138
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,650
you know it.
I gotta go is.

139
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,090
He genuinely doesn't give a fuck.

140
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,923
I don't give a fuck if he.
He became like the d don't give a fuck 

141
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,334
scale.
He became like the new metric of not 

142
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,220
giving a fuck like they used to be 
accepted.

143
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,150
There's levels of giving a fuck.
You know,

144
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,193
like you and I can't claim that we don't
give a fuck the way he does because we 

145
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,680
have families are.
You should fear is free.

146
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,510
If should fear just got a vasectomy.
He would give even less of a fuck.

147
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,320
That would be like the last straw of 
fuck that he has left in his body.

148
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,413
He's a barbarian.
You know what show killed me will love 

149
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:32,414
it.
You know what show like fuck with me 

150
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,600
when I did it.
Tony Hinchcliffe show on Monday nights.

151
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,080
The really good podcasts.
He does it.

152
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:39,914
The store,
the one where he killed Tony Killed 

153
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,841
Tony.
Oh,

154
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,820
when you're watching the one minute 
people go.

155
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,120
I went down at one night and I didn't.
It wasn't about the material.

156
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,990
It wasn't about anything but the look in
their eyes.

157
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,880
I remember that.
Look in your eye pro when you don't have

158
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:53,930
dinner in here.
Yeah,

159
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,520
and your car's got on me and your job 
sucks and he was swinging.

160
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,383
I left there and I couldn't sleep that 
night because I went back to 94 when I 

161
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:05,180
used to go back to my room and cry or 
clubs.

162
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:06,890
All of the performance.
Some they'll be good.

163
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,880
They'll be at the punchline.
Would write that down there.

164
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,930
I'm going to be there.
Yeah.

165
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,830
We get that San Francisco newspaper and 
at the end of the,

166
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,664
just for laughs,
the last three pages that had a comedy 

167
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,180
guide from Alaska all the way to Wyoming
of all the comedy club listings,

168
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,193
whether they will one night isn't that 
and I just sit there and circle them 

169
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:26,794
with a note booking through a line of 
coke and cries and some day I'll be at 

170
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,480
the fucking rusty,
you know,

171
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,590
but that's when I went to Tony 
Hinchcliffe show.

172
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,270
There was,
you know what it reminded me of.

173
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,104
What was that movie?
What rocky movie did he take them back 

174
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,790
to the ghetto and train them on three 
when they walked in,

175
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,520
all the black dudes had veins in her 
eyes and shit like that.

176
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:46,911
Like,
yeah,

177
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,140
whatever up.
I didn't give a fuck.

178
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,230
And he's like this memo.
All these guys rock.

179
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,720
This used to be you.
Yes.

180
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,220
This used to be.
You look at their eyes.

181
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,350
Rob was that.
Was that rocky three?

182
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,470
Was it Jamie?
Jamie is on it already.

183
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,323
All right,
so two,

184
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,370
he fights Apollo again and three he 
fights buster Lang clubber clubber Lang.

185
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,890
I'm sorry,
was he ain't got no heart,

186
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,380
but you still have every night wishing 
you had a real man.

187
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,400
Was a three.
Bring your pretty little cell phone with

188
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:18,620
my apartment tonight.
I'll show you a real man and that was at

189
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,690
a rock.
He couldn't take it anymore.

190
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,380
That was a great fucking movie,
but one we call your kids to do.

191
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,433
Dude.
MrT.

192
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,840
was one of the most terrifying fucking 
villains ever in a boxing movie,

193
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,350
not Joe Rogan.
Do you remember the doorman challenge?

194
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,780
That dorm,
how he became famous?

195
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,140
No.
Okay.

196
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,093
Him,
Mr.

197
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,963
t him and a bunch of other dudes on NBC.
That was a show about either doorman 

198
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,890
what bounces and they did something and 
that's how he was noticed.

199
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,683
Something weird.
There was a show about the toughest 

200
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,030
bounces for awhile,

201
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,680
six episodes,
and he was the main one.

202
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,543
Bounces doorman in 1980.
It was like wild world of sports type 

203
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,671
thing.
Hey,

204
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:10,110
go back to that for a second.
Jamie to that clubber Lang footage.

205
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:10,944
The training footage.
I was under the impression that like I 

206
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,300
remember thinking that he really looked 
good as a boxer,

207
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,180
but I'm watching him shadow box there 
and I'm like,

208
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:24,340
what?
No one has a gift.

209
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:25,174
The throwing like smoke at you.
Everybody looks good while you're 

210
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,220
watching it.
I love that scene.

211
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,620
When Mickey was looking at the bubbles 
and he's getting mad,

212
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,870
like,
Ugh,

213
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,750
ugh.
If you like let it go,

214
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:41,220
keep going.
It'll a show him shadow boxing,

215
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,683
which sometimes people don't look that 
good when they're shadowboxing because 

216
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,770
they're just trying to loosen their body
up.

217
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,143
There's a bunch of different like right 
there that does not look that guy who 

218
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,880
actually knows how to punch,
but you know,

219
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,000
it looks like a lot of swinging,
you know,

220
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,390
it's not.

221
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,060
Those aren't punches,
so like a lot of arm movements.

222
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,740
We've got to meet in the head cut at 
that time,

223
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:03,690
it's 1980.
He didn't know what to expect.

224
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,860
There's a thing with was shadowboxing,
like some people think that shadowboxing

225
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,753
should just be a loosening up thing.
They just do it loose and they let the 

226
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,373
shoulders go loose and they try to work 
on their snap and they tried to move 

227
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:17,394
around,
but then there's some people that think 

228
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,360
you should treat it almost as if it's a 
fight,

229
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,540
like as if you're simulating a fight.
Like Jamie looked this up,

230
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Joseph Vault Illini shadowboxing.
He's a glory kickboxing champ and he put

231
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:36,060
up this video of how he shadow boxes and
you shadow boxes.

232
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:36,894
Like he's in a fight.
He doesn't think of it as time off or a 

233
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:44,070
warm up or something like that.
What he does is he fights like a pretend

234
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,933
opponent.

235
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,580
It's pretty interesting because a lot of
guys don't do it that way.

236
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,070
Like not,
not to this extent like uh,

237
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,590
you know guys,
when you're shadow boxing,

238
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,110
a lot of it is just,
he kinda loosened around you doing it on

239
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,000
your own pace.
You're working on your own shit,

240
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,013
but what he does is kind of more like he
treats it like a different kind of a 

241
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,350
workout like Justin Fortune does down at
that gym to.

242
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,840
Does he the second look at it as like a 
calorie burner in the beginning?

243
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,540
Really just.
I mean if you do it correctly,

244
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,670
he says you should break a big sweater 
or something.

245
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,470
Yeah,
if you do it correctly.

246
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,304
Which I don't know just.
Well it's a lot of people think it's 

247
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,820
like visualization they think might be 
as important as anything else.

248
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,710
Like everything's important.
You know,

249
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:23,790
it's important to be in shape.

250
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,623
It's important to be strong.
It's important to have experience in 

251
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,900
support and to have really good 
technique,

252
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,450
but it's also important to visualize.
There's something about carving pathways

253
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,284
in the brain and obviously if you're a 
neuroscientist and you'll listen to 

254
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,021
this,
you're like,

255
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:37,854
oh my God,
this idiot doesn't know what the fuck 

256
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:40,550
he's talking about,
but there's,

257
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,590
there's something about carving 
pathways.

258
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,240
This is not it.
There's a,

259
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:49,110
there's a different visual comedy.
You have a dream shadowboxing.

260
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:52,910
He's throwing kicks and punches and 
knees and backing up and you have a.

261
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560
This would stand up like you see 
yourself onstage killing.

262
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,890
I've tried and I can't do it,
like positive realization.

263
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,020
No,
I don't think it works with standup.

264
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,880
I think um,
no,

265
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,110
I think uh,
with stand up the thing,

266
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,170
the kids doing it.
I got it.

267
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,670
I tried,
I took the reef of fucked me up,

268
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,900
but I couldn't come to focus.

269
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,310
Like the visualizations.
Yeah.

270
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:19,060
Like I couldn't see myself onstage like 
walking out and seeing people go.

271
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,860
I could see myself coming out of the 
garden.

272
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:24,550
I can't do that shit.
Here's just for me personally,

273
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,384
here's why I would try,
I would try not to think like that 

274
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,383
because if I have,
I visualize myself doing something and 

275
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,940
doing it really well.
I would,

276
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:35,350
um,
I would think of,

277
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:36,184
um,
I wouldn't think of the thing I was 

278
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,824
doing anymore.
Now I'm thinking of like the accolades 

279
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:46,270
or the position it is or look you're on 
a big stage and look,

280
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:47,104
you know,
you're at this place and you're at 

281
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,880
Massey Hall in Toronto or something,
you know,

282
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:55,120
some historic venue like,
and then one day I was there like,

283
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,550
that seems like you're thinking more 
about,

284
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,140
about success than what,
what success really is,

285
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:05,470
is like if you're doing something and 
you try to do it,

286
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,150
do it the best you can.

287
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,310
Not the or the reaction that it gets,
so if I'm concentrating on the reaction,

288
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,410
like I'm concentrating on going up there
and killing,

289
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,220
I would have to be visualizing doing a 
show,

290
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,860
so I'd have to begin realizing people 
laughing.

291
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,270
I can't.
I've tried,

292
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,104
I can't do it.
I've sat there like at the gym and put 

293
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,073
right to cool off and he said,
well maybe I'll see myself killing for 

294
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:30,910
the special or whatever.
I didn't see any of that shit.

295
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,600
Doesn't that make sense though?
That if you think of yourself as killing

296
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,434
you thinking of other people laughing,
but you're not thinking about yourself 

297
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:40,500
then.
Right?

298
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,630
Like so if you're visualizing skiing,
you're thinking about skiing,

299
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,070
right?
You're thinking about tucking.

300
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:48,940
You're thinking about doing your moves 
in the correct way.

301
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,000
You get the most amount of speed and the
most amount of controls.

302
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,330
You're headed down this hill,
right?

303
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,800
You're not thinking about other people.
You're not thinking about other people's

304
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,440
response to each one of those things you
do.

305
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,990
Like if every time he did a curve and 
you didn't get a laugh,

306
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,641
he'd be like,
what the fuck?

307
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,290
I thought it was skiing good.
You know,

308
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,570
if you tell a joke,
well you get a laugh,

309
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,463
right?
But you don't want to think about that 

310
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:11,230
laugh.
You don't want to visualize a laugh.

311
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,390
You want to pretend that people are 
laughing at it.

312
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,480
You want to actually find out what's 
funny and have other people tell you for

313
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,220
you,
like you kind of know,

314
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,010
but you don't really know until you do 
it in front of them.

315
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,233
Right.
So to visualize that is really weird 

316
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:25,324
because you're visualizing two different
mindsets so you're not in this the zone 

317
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:29,940
of actually being there.
You're,

318
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,520
you're visualizing artificial laughter.
I mean,

319
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,810
I guess you could visualize this state 
that you're feeling when you're killing,

320
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,213
when you're really relaxed on stage and 
you're having a good time and 

321
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,170
everything's fun.
I could visualize that state.

322
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,950
That makes sense.
I can't,

323
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,853
but I think even that state,
you could only like visualize it and I 

324
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,680
shouldn't say only.

325
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Maybe I could only do it in chunks.
I think I just think it's better to just

326
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:02,150
concentrate on just doing.
It just never worked for me.

327
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,560
So I wonder if you ever did up.
I on it.

328
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,403
I just,
I also think would stand up like you 

329
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,494
could do a lot of sets and stuff,
but I don't know if he should 

330
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,254
concentrate on it as much as 
concentrating on just life itself and 

331
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:21,710
finding things that you think are funny 
and interesting.

332
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,003
You know,
because sometimes if you concentrate 

333
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,180
just on standup too much,
you almost like narrows your focus.

334
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,860
So you're thinking so much about 
standup.

335
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:30,694
You're not thinking about shit to talk 
about onstage because you're not really 

336
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:34,480
thinking about it.
You're,

337
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,353
you're,
you're obsessed with some tour date 

338
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,180
details or some,
you know,

339
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,630
some thing that might be an offer that's
on the table.

340
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:44,464
What do you think I should do it?
Instead of thinking about that kind of 

341
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:47,074
Shit,

342
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,383
you just like,
you only have a certain amount of 

343
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,573
resources that your brain has available 
and it's when you can stop thinking 

344
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:02,711
about like if you can just push any 
career ideas completely out of your head

345
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,950
and just exist as a person and then go 
and do stuff.

346
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,650
If you could figure out how to shut that
off and go and do stuff,

347
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,860
for me at least it gives me more ideas.
I get more ideas that way and I get A.

348
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm.
I feed my curiosity too quick.

349
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,680
It feels like a feed.
My curiosity and an honest way.

350
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,840
Instead of thinking about religious 
reading,

351
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:27,674
things that I would think would be funny
on stage or read and stuff that I think 

352
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,980
would be fun to talk about in a podcast.
I just look at Shit.

353
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:35,150
That's interesting.
You know?

354
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,343
Goddamn.
It makes sense on a one to 10 right now 

355
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,623
we're cooking.
It's up there like I've stolen this 

356
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:45,854
morning.
I stopped at the weed store on the way 

357
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,660
up in a little half.
I had a bull to get the party started my

358
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:51,590
system.
You know what I'm saying?

359
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,390
We're about a month away from legal 
weed.

360
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,313
That's it,
but it's going to go down for people 

361
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:59,090
like me because the edible count is 
going down to 10 milligrams.

362
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:03,860
I already got the warning of that.
There will be meetings.

363
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,040
That guy goes for you to 900 milligrams.
Again,

364
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,700
you'll have to be floated.
You'll be fucking stuffed with gelatin.

365
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:12,830
That 10 milligrams.
Just stop this.

366
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,520
Yeah,
no,

367
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,870
there's some shit going around that.
I'm also doing that cbd to one to one.

368
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,960
That's good too.
Oh,

369
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,020
not bad at night.
This goddamn Jambo breath spray this.

370
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,360
This one milligram does madison from God
a.

371
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:33,550
This one's a thousand of what?
A spray bottle.

372
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,003
The whole bottles of thousand.
So if you're to take the top off that 

373
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,900
shit.
That's really good.

374
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,753
That's a bit open to that.
I take the cbd off from a company in 

375
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,700
Denver.
XNL.

376
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,190
It's a 300 milligram c deal.
When he got back

377
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,350
from Jujitsu,
he put it right onto here.

378
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,184
It doesn't get you out.
This is the woman that just by the time 

379
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,040
you get out of the shower,
you're like,

380
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,470
what happened?
Oh,

381
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,110
who has seen?
So it's just cbd oil because they,

382
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:03,590
you know,
they make it with marijuana dermally.

383
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,230
Well that goes back.
That goes into your system lot better.

384
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,740
The one that one that I'm taking this 
for children.

385
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,603
People don't want thc in it,
but this one has such a high conscious 

386
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,280
trade of CBD oil.
Yeah,

387
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,380
but the other thing,
they make it with something else.

388
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,460
Oh,
that he goes,

389
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,260
put that on the tunnel.
One or two drops.

390
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,190
You're a big guy,
right?

391
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:26,040
When you get home from Jujitsu and then 
take a shower.

392
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,020
Not too bad.
Joe Rogan.

393
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's try this stuff here.
Stuff of it.

394
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,834
Some of it tastes like Dick.
Some of it tastes like fucking guava 

395
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:35,071
juice.
Does.

396
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,320
These people that do require the Jews?
Jesus Christ.

397
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,793
My bad mentor,
my mentee is actually a nice little 

398
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:47,100
breast spray.
Another two shots.

399
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:49,200
The GL fucked up and did too many 
sprays.

400
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:50,034
One of these ones before Sam Harris' 
podcast and Sam was talking crazy shit 

401
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:58,020
about artificial intelligence and all 
this other,

402
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,640
you know,
every time I talked to that guy,

403
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,150
he's a neuroscientist.
Very,

404
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:01,820
very so I know.
Yeah.

405
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,130
I know.
You know is right and I was.

406
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,250
I was barbecued when I was talking to 
him.

407
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,093
Like barbecued.
I totally overestimated or 

408
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:11,314
underestimated.
These sprays had no idea like I thought 

409
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,280
like a couple pumps is probably like a 
pot lollipop,

410
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,570
you know?
Now,

411
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,390
I don't know.
It must have been hundreds of milligrams

412
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,224
each day.
Anything under your fucking tongue like 

413
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:23,910
that?
Yeah.

414
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,470
It goes quick.
Sixty seconds.

415
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,090
You're on a plane.
Next scene.

416
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,890
The planes fucking making weird noises.
That lighting on fire and now it was.

417
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:32,730
Androids are hitting them.

418
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,803
It's going to change the world when it 
becomes legal folks and it's not going 

419
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,160
to change the world for the worst.
It's going to change it for the better.

420
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,890
It's gonna.
Make people paranoid as fuck.

421
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,290
It's going to make people nicer.
Really.

422
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,680
Is that paranoid as fuck thing?
That's good.

423
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,680
You don't say Dick Do.
That's how I live.

424
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:50,770
I don't say Dick.
I don't know.

425
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:51,604
No blame.
There's some days I don't even fucking 

426
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:55,950
shave.
I leave the house and they don't know.

427
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,510
It's tremendous to live that way.
I don't bother nobody.

428
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,400
I go into starbucks.
I don't hear nothing.

429
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,893
I don't know.
Nothing.

430
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,850
Time for reflection.
Yeah,

431
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,020
that's it.
That's all it is.

432
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

433
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,213
One thing,
I don't get hives when I go to the 

434
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,550
Jigsaw,
I still can't work that up yet.

435
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:15,360
That's too real phone call Joey.
That's too real for me.

436
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,090
Somebody gets me the deep south.
I'm fucking history.

437
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,313
Used to get high before I fuck you guys 
do the eye candy and I used to take 

438
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,610
giant bong hits,
giant bomb and then we would roll.

439
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,560
Yeah,
I'd have a panic attack.

440
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,423
Yeah.
We would go into class and as soon as 

441
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:36,720
somebody gets on top of you like that 
and he would teach like that,

442
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,870
he would teach like that.
Blitzkrieg teach like a,

443
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,280
like a Jedi Knight.
Yeah.

444
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:45,870
He teach tremendous master how you want 
your fucking dude unconscious.

445
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,003
Well,
for him,

446
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,100
for his style

447
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,200
of the key.
He's like,

448
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,450
um,
you know,

449
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,250
Eddie,
he's got a very interesting style,

450
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,930
not just of Jujitsu but of explaining 
his Jujitsu,

451
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,103
you know,
explaining all the moves and all the 

452
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,660
different positions and it's like a,
there's a,

453
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,610
there's like a presentation that he's 
doing.

454
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,200
It's like a,
it's like an art form.

455
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,960
We pay.
Somebody brought me a comedian friends.

456
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,150
He's doing something completely 
different.

457
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:13,984
On the other side,
because every place you show up to do 

458
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:16,714
comedy is one fucking do it with a 10 
plan is at least he's got a little any 

459
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,210
of these three for people because even 
the little towns,

460
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,283
they get the videos and get a mat and 
they do all that shit by themselves 

461
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:31,900
watching a fucking videos.
They've told me when I went to Omaha,

462
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,710
people came in from our ma.
There's a 10th planet Endo Model.

463
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,840
That's great,
but people who don't want to make.

464
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,730
The people were telling me they get like
couches,

465
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,280
Jujitsu couches,
mattress.

466
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,114
That's like they're fucking grassy.
So if your little town doesn't have an 

467
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,343
eddie spreading and now like his 
students are winning fucking tournament 

468
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,114
and now Ebi is on Tbi is game the best 
thing to ever happen to submission 

469
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:57,904
grappling because it made it exciting.
They figured out a way to about rules 

470
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:03,010
and you know that right?
But when I'm reading Hugh Jitsu magazine

471
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:03,844
and this saying that they're gonna take,
they're gonna start using Ebi rules and 

472
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:09,890
shit.
Ebi Is Eddie Bravo exhibit.

473
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,460
Yeah.
You know,

474
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,770
Chael Sonnen did it and here's how 
beautiful Eddie is.

475
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,110
Eddie doesn't even want money for them 
using it.

476
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm pretty sure he was like,
yeah,

477
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:22,160
I just want those rules to be 
established as the best rules.

478
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,170
Just give me credit called the Ebi rules
and you can use some smart way to do it.

479
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,870
He just wants to spread Jujitsu in the 
right way and you know,

480
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,733
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with having a non tbi rules of any 

481
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:35,800
either.
You know,

482
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,770
like if somebody wants to do like what 
metamorris was doing and have these long

483
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:41,650
bouts and if they go to draw at the end 
to go to draw at the end,

484
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,230
you know,
a lot on the podcast,

485
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:44,064
some of the time you got to break 
everything down and be like just I bbs 

486
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,723
and well there's anybody.
So essentially anybody can essentially 

487
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:53,590
start their own rules like Abu Dhabi 
where uh,

488
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Eddie choked out heuler they had a very 
interesting rules where the first period

489
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:02,890
of the fight there was no points and 
then encouraged you to go for it.

490
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,293
Right?
So you try to submit someone within the 

491
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:06,610
first,
uh,

492
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,970
first half of the fight or take it real 
conservative,

493
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:14,080
which was another approach,
and you play super defense for the first

494
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:14,710
half of the fight.

495
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,320
Then at the second half of the fight you
can score points.

496
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,860
So you score points for take downs,
score points for guard,

497
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,870
passes,
near submissions,

498
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:24,780
things like that.
So I think their,

499
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,620
their logic was that if they just have 
no points in the beginning,

500
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,710
it doesn't matter if a dude mounts you,
doesn't matter if a guy takes your back,

501
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,544
if you defend,
if you're trying to attack him and go 

502
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:35,524
after him,
sometimes you'd worried if I don't get 

503
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:39,730
this guy might be so far behind it 
points I'll never catch up.

504
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,390
Like if you just go for it and you fuck 
up and you wind up in a bad position,

505
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,520
then you defend that position and then 
you get back to your feet and then maybe

506
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:47,354
the guy takes you down.
That's a sequence of events that if 

507
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:52,280
you're counting takedowns and near 
submissions and things like that can put

508
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,870
you in his giant deficit.

509
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,790
And if the guys that good that he could 
do that to you,

510
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,610
maybe you underestimated them and you'll
never catch up to them,

511
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,120
but you could find out if you just go 
for it,

512
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,100
if you both go for it and you don't 
worry about points.

513
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,083
So that was their idea I think.
I think to promote more excitement so 

514
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:08,594
people just go for it in the beginning.
And then the idea about the second half 

515
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:15,590
is that once you're establishing who's 
the better grappler,

516
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,680
when two guys roll and they're trying to
kill each other,

517
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,690
you learn pretty quick who's better.
And so then if no one's better,

518
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,610
if it's just by a very,
very,

519
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,444
very slight edge.
So if you've gotten to the second half 

520
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:29,324
of the fight and you both,
you're both in a neutral position but 

521
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:32,894
you both attacked,
both defended and no one's had any sort 

522
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:35,954
of an upper hand.

523
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,033
Those last few minutes is,
it's really going to count because 

524
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,734
that's the few minutes where your 
determination in training camp showed 

525
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,540
up.
Your ability to adjust,

526
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,613
your ability to overcome.
Like all those things really do 

527
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:48,224
determine who's best.
So having that towards the end of the 

528
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,830
fight.
That makes sense.

529
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,560
How long has Abu Dhabi,
if I go to the whole man,

530
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,280
that's a good question because at 2:15
says the two times I'm a don't remember,

531
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm thinking it's two tens,
but that seems like a long time.

532
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,460
Maybe it was less than that.
Um,

533
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,250
Abo dobby submission,
grappling time limits.

534
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,570
Because what does Eddie doing with Ebi?
He does the first.

535
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,900
How many minutes?
I'm not sure.

536
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,370
I think it's like the first nine minutes
or something like that.

537
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,370
They just go at it and there's no 
points.

538
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:23,204
And if some,
if they make it into the final or they 

539
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:29,891
make it a pass at time limit,
then they go through these series of bad

540
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:31,424
positions.

541
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,240
Like one guy starts on the other guy's 
back and he has over under and then go,

542
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:35,841
ready,
go.

543
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:36,674
And you start from there.
So one guy has got your back and you 

544
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:39,374
have to defend it.
And if you can tap him then he has an 

545
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:46,940
opportunity to try the same position.
And if you could tap you,

546
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,070
I think it goes to who?
God who.

547
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:53,870
First I think it like it's in the amount
of time it took to tap them,

548
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,060
so that's where the competition would be
five minutes over time.

549
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,960
So qualifying rounds,
six minutes,

550
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,690
three minutes overtime if there's a draw
finals,

551
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,660
eight minutes,
four minutes over time if there's a draw

552
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:12,200
with no advantage.
So what it probably is like four minutes

553
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:14,720
in.
They start scoring the point.

554
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,763
Yeah,
there it is right there at the first 

555
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,200
four minutes are without positive 
points,

556
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,130
but negative points start from the 
beginning of the fight until the end.

557
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,130
And I think negative points or like when
you draw guard,

558
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,580
when you pull guard,
I think that was a negative point.

559
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:29,414
I don't know if it still is,
but I think that's silly because some 

560
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:33,830
guys,
if they pull you into their guard,

561
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,783
you're fucked.
Like there's guys like vinny malaise 

562
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,720
lace or like,
um,

563
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,890
a Shinya Aoki.
That guy is just nasty fucking guard.

564
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:44,880
If in his guard you're in a terrible 
place,

565
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,630
the church is sponsoring vinny magalogs 
a magalog is a bad mother.

566
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,830
I love his Jujitsu.
So fucking high level man.

567
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,850
You know,
he's,

568
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,500
he spent a lot of time fighting in MMA 
and because of the fighting in the mma,

569
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:01,290
I think a lot of people slept on his 
Jujitsu.

570
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,100
They forget what a fiend ami is.
He Flying Armbar,

571
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,993
paid the Pano,
who's like this multiple time Brazilian 

572
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:09,894
jujitsu world champion and vinny.
Vinny Magalhaes hit him with a flying 

573
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:13,224
arm bar.

574
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,213
Do you know that's,
that is like pulling your deck out and 

575
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,990
slapping it across a world champions 
face.

576
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:21,740
I mean literally how,
how powerful that move.

577
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:24,390
But when you say flying,
check this out,

578
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,380
see if you could find it.
He's huge.

579
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,214
Two,
usually 230 pounds and he hits him with 

580
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:34,620
a flying arm bar and it's perfect.
She was perfect.

581
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,390
Like there's no,
there's no defending.

582
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,120
Now this guy that he's.
This is uh,

583
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,730
this is Chris Weidman.
He got Chris Weidman with it too.

584
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,750
Yeah.
Well you could watch this to.

585
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,560
I mean Vinnie did hit Chris Weidman with
the same shit.

586
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,430
Dude.
Vinnie's super worldclass.

587
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,470
Now you gotta remember Chris Weidman a 
two time NCAA all American wrestler like

588
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,400
super fucking grappler.

589
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,440
And that's how good Vinnie Meg Alexis.
I mean,

590
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:04,020
Weidman,
when he won the UFC,

591
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,260
let's see if you could find it in here 
because this is a long match.

592
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,520
Weidman,
when he,

593
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,354
uh,
when he won the UFC middleweight title 

594
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:12,984
from Anderson Silva was widely thought 
to be like one of the toughest best 

595
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,114
wrestlers,
best grapplers it's ever fought in the 

596
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,410
middleweight division.
There was a big strength of his,

597
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,910
is that he was just so nasty on the 
ground and so fucking strong.

598
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,500
Oh my God.
Exactly.

599
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,560
You see when a dude can do that to a 
Chris Weidman,

600
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,230
that's what a bad motherfucker.
Vinny Magalhaes says,

601
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,390
you just don't.
That doesn't happen.

602
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,450
Watch this again.
Come on,

603
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,284
son.
I mean he just took that with just 

604
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,650
spectacular technique and he's a huge 
guy.

605
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,960
I,
he will say he's at least,

606
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,110
you know what to 10 or something like 
that to 15,

607
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:53,850
I don't know.

608
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,470
In the UFC he fought a light 
heavyweight.

609
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,950
Right?
Go find.

610
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,040
Yeah,
because you've lost a Ryan Bader and the

611
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,580
finals member of the ultimate fighter.
She's striking.

612
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,560
You know,
he got better at striking,

613
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,090
but that was what had held him back.
His Jujitsu is off the fucking chain.

614
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,970
He did another stint in the UFC.
Right.

615
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,830
Me Do a couple stents.
Yeah,

616
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,980
but like you get caught in that guy's 
guard,

617
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,410
you're fucked.
Like that's a bad position.

618
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:20,244
So I disagree with them.
Like saying that pulling guard is a one 

619
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,670
point disadvantage.
So if he pulls a gun out on me,

620
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:28,520
really mega lez urine health,
urine,

621
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:31,620
hell no,
like get out of it.

622
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:34,110
But you're in danger.
You're in severe danger.

623
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,273
There's people where their guard is more
of a defensive position as people with 

624
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,203
who the wrap their legs around you and 
what they're trying to do is just kind 

625
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,080
of hold on me to just breathe.

626
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,580
Yeah.
Maybe they're taking their sweet time.

627
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:46,414
They're get to breathe,
they're gonna relax and then they're 

628
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,513
gonna.
Maybe try to explode back up to their 

629
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,870
feet or try to reverse your.
Try to stand up or something like that.

630
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,273
But then there's guys like vinny,
they're trying to break your arm and 

631
00:29:57,531 --> 00:29:58,990
that's immediately what it's going to go
to.

632
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:00,760
It was going to go to rubber guard.
I mean,

633
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,594
Vinnie has like really fucking 
ridiculous experience when it comes to 

634
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,983
submissions.
I mean he's just super technical and a 

635
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:16,201
big guy like that's a rare combination.
If you get caught in that guy's guard,

636
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:17,860
you're,
you know,

637
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,860
you're not favored to get out of it.
Especially if you underestimated it.

638
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,080
Like that's another thing about guards,
if you train with a guy,

639
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,280
it was like an Eddie Bravo or his guards
just all ultra dangerous.

640
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,930
If you don't train with a guy like that,
maybe the guys in your gym,

641
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:38,560
they're not scary from their back so you
don't worry about it.

642
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,570
Maybe you're a wrestler,
maybe you got good defense,

643
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,440
you feel like,
you know what,

644
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,470
I see that shit come and nobody gets me 
in my gym,

645
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,440
but they probably don't have the same 
level of guard.

646
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:48,274
There's some guys out there that have 
this ridiculously reflect refined level 

647
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,910
of God.
You remember Paul Sas?

648
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,960
No.
So the guy in the UFC,

649
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,780
he won almost every fight.
I think he won one by.

650
00:30:58,781 --> 00:30:59,510
He'll hook.
He,

651
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,311
he,
he,

652
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:01,144
he'll hooked.
Michael Johnson who is going to be 

653
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:04,450
fighting.
Habib never gotten that off.

654
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,690
But Paul Sas Triangle the fuck out of 
everybody.

655
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,600
I mean he triangled the fuck out of 
everybody.

656
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,450
Nobody can get away from his triangle.
It was just this crazy thing.

657
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,210
If this kid would grab a ahold,
we'd pull guard.

658
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,610
He would get his creep,
his legs up over your shoulder.

659
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,740
And before you know it,
you were choking herself to sleep.

660
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,840
She was incredible.
He,

661
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,120
I don't remember how many fights he won 
by triangle,

662
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:25,954
but it was so ridiculous because 
everybody knew it and he would go out 

663
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:30,160
there and he would do it and everybody's
like,

664
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
just stay the fuck away from his 
triangle.

665
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,100
Just stay the fuck away from his 
triangle.

666
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,570
Next thing you know,
he's on his back and you're like,

667
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,640
it's a terrible position to be in.
And if a guy's legs are like really good

668
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:46,300
at doing those movements,
your legs are so strong.

669
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,130
There's so much stronger than your arms.
The thing that we lack is not strength.

670
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:52,320
It's dexterity.
Well,

671
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,213
some guys figured that dexterity thing 
out and when you have these high level 

672
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:59,560
guys,
you'll see if you.

673
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,583
That's just a.
That was one where he won by leg lock 

674
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,600
here.
But look how good he is dude.

675
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,003
Like when he,
when he gets guys into a position where 

676
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,520
they think that they're safe,
it's all it is,

677
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,390
is another leg lock to look at that.

678
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,810
Oh this is nasty shit man.
But,

679
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:20,830
so this is my point is that like there 
are guys that are super,

680
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:25,831
super dangerous off their back.
It shouldn't be a negative point.

681
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,210
Michael.
Jonathan has nothing on.

682
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,850
Has not thrown a punch.
So even if you mess with him.

683
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,890
Yeah,
he got tore up here.

684
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,940
I mean this is a bad because if they get
rid of Paul says they get videos,

685
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,950
economy think.
So I don't remember.

686
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:41,270
I mean he didn't win all of his fights.
He was a tough,

687
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,950
tough guy.
But man,

688
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:43,784
his submissions were awesome to watch 
and he fucked a lot of guys up off his 

689
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:50,810
back another.
And this is an mma whereas actually,

690
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,190
oh damn,
that's nasty.

691
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:53,024
And they tapped right there.
And this is an mma where you can get 

692
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:56,594
punched in Abu Dhabi,
you can't even get punched so you can 

693
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:01,154
get much deeper in a position to not 
worrying about worrying about being 

694
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:04,790
vulnerable to strikes.

695
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,900
So guys like Gary Tonin was like one of 
the best in the world right now.

696
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,410
He's,
I'm known for his leg locks and he takes

697
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:13,244
off his back all the time.
So to think that that guy gets a 

698
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,950
negative point because he's attacking 
off of his back to me.

699
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:19,784
So that's loony as loony.
If he gets a hold of you and you're in 

700
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,174
his guard,
you're going to get your knee ripped 

701
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:26,480
apart.
If guys at a knee ripper,

702
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,140
I mean they're all the Donna,
her death squad,

703
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,940
that's what they call themselves.
You know John Donahoe Dude,

704
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,730
he's got like a hundred knee rippers 
over there.

705
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,003
Just get super technical leg lock guys 
were there and they're all doing it 

706
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,313
primarily off their back.
But in MMA it's way more dangerous in 

707
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:47,420
MMA.
Guys can punch you.

708
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,170
Oh wait,
no.

709
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,500
That Fried Shit I've told you once I 
told you you given makes me nervous.

710
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,334
It gives me anxiety.
Are you one of those guys that shows up 

711
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:56,090
for Jujitsu class for wrestling shoes 
on?

712
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,950
No,
there's always a guy like that.

713
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,590
No.
There is a guy at my place and you don't

714
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:02,740
want to fuck with them or say something 
about his restaurant.

715
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,020
He don't speak the language.
He's like from Bulgaria.

716
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,030
Oh yeah,
yeah.

717
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,300
One minute.
You're in this garden,

718
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,070
next one that you're swinging around 
the.

719
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:11,630
Yeah,
and the Sambo Guy.

720
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,480
I'm 100 to 100 pounds heavier dude.
Those guys are terrifying.

721
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,430
Like the first day he came in to visit 
and all you heard was Ba,

722
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,640
ba Ba boom.
Yeah.

723
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,130
He didn't really know.
Like he just.

724
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,640
Just a great guy.
Yeah.

725
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,400
He thought he was still in the fucking 
Kamala over there.

726
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,130
Well,
he was probably great guys.

727
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,200
Great guys.
Just buddies.

728
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,450
A Blue Bell always take the time to 
teach me something.

729
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,720
Great guys.
I mean it,

730
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,730
but he just has the strength of dead 
fucking skinny guys from Russia,

731
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:43,370
whatever those little,
those little neighborhoods can be.

732
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,020
Those motherfuckers been,
you know,

733
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:47,780
they don't pick up weights.
They pick up trees and shit like that.

734
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,730
And they know how to handle off balance 
and stuff.

735
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,860
It's a really beautiful thing to see.
I want to.

736
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,020
I stayed one day afterwards as I was 
getting dressed and he was teaching like

737
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,240
the higher balance,
like they were flying.

738
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,483
Yeah.

739
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,180
Sambo guys especially,
uh,

740
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:04,930
there's,
you know,

741
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,450
there's two types of.
There's combat sambo,

742
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,340
which is like would fade or used to 
fight in.

743
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,790
You ever see that where they put 
headgear on and they have like a judo,

744
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,550
Jackson mma gloves and they beat the 
fuck out of each other.

745
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:16,770
Dude,
that's a,

746
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,150
that's one kind of sambal that's more of
a,

747
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,100
you know,
it's,

748
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,933
it's kind of a hybrid.
It's almost like they have the juno 

749
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:23,914
jacket.
They were fucking judo jack and shorts 

750
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,160
on the,
um,

751
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,380
the guy has the world series of fighting
heavyweight champion.

752
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,603
I forget his name,
but he's a Russian gentleman and he's a 

753
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:37,090
guy who is that his name?
It got.

754
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,683
But he's,
he's the first guy to beat fader in a 

755
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,480
long time.
He beat him in combat.

756
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:46,890
Sambo before fate or a wind up losing an
MMA.

757
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,370
Yeah.
I vanoff blog,

758
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:55,610
a blog boy Ivan off blog,
avant off is it tough,

759
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,270
tough fucking guy.

760
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,343
But he beat fade or in that combat sambo
stuff where they had the judo jacket on 

761
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,963
shit,
and I think it was before fate or was 

762
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,530
went on that losing streak.
Now combat is.

763
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:08,364
Well,
obviously you show up with fucking 

764
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,340
swords and shit.
No,

765
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,100
no,
they just,

766
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,570
they just,
it's just mma.

767
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,220
It's MMA with a judo jacket on.
Now.

768
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:15,790
What color?
Peach.

769
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,483
That's a good question.
What does Chris Herzog is big time 

770
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,230
sambo?
This guy comes over and does seminars in

771
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,110
rockchester.
I would have to bad or the other.

772
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:25,891
I don't know.
I don't.

773
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:26,940
I mean,
I'm sure there's a bunch of.

774
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:29,660
I mean I'm not,
I'm not that well versed in,

775
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,130
in Zombot,
but there's two different styles.

776
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,200
Assembling.
A lot of times people confuse the two of

777
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:35,160
them.
Like,

778
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:39,570
um,
one time I was watching a fight and they

779
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:40,404
were talking about this guy's a sambo 
background and the commentator was 

780
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:49,080
saying that he didn't think that in 
sambo there were strikes,

781
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,160
so probably won't be as comfortable with
getting hit because he's a sambo guy,

782
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,323
but he,
but he didn't realize is he actually 

783
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:58,800
came from that combat sambo background,
which is the fate or background,

784
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,660
which is where they would have these 
fights.

785
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,493
Were you ever seen it see,
pull up combat sambo because it's kind 

786
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:04,704
of wild.
It's weird looking like it's high level 

787
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:07,944
MMA,
but they have judo jackets on and 

788
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,660
headgear and they're kicking the shit 
out of each other,

789
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,040
punching the shit out of each other.
I mean,

790
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,620
it is mma,
but there's also grappling to.

791
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:18,080
And they're aided by the,
the,

792
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,220
the thing.
Yeah.

793
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,170
I mean this is a,
is weird looking,

794
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:27,660
right?
They got a fucking jacket on and they're

795
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:28,890
doing mma.
I,

796
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,480
it doesn't totally make sense.

797
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,070
No cage,
you know,

798
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,780
look at that.
Oh shit son.

799
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,020
Oh my God.
That was a three 62.

800
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,820
Yeah.
So you know,

801
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,621
that's.
Yeah,

802
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:44,750
no cage.
I like a lot.

803
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,320
I've been saying this lately,
I think this is stupid.

804
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,393
I think cages are stupid.
I think if we have a floor that's big 

805
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:52,994
enough to have a basketball game,
you have a floor that's big enough for 

806
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:58,130
two days to fight.
Fuck,

807
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,880
come on.
You put down some mats.

808
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,743
No more walls.
This pushing each other up against the 

809
00:38:05,091 --> 00:38:09,620
wall is stupid.
Unless you're fighting some hallway.

810
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,070
Why are you fighting all go outside out 
in the woods.

811
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,050
You crazy kids.
They did in Russia,

812
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:18,884
man.
They had a fucking a MMA fight on a 

813
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:23,180
football field.
But what the fuck were you talking about

814
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,014
and the way in today,
you would drop some knowledge on me 

815
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:31,460
about some gym where they're fighting in
the fucking movie with the black dudes.

816
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,890
What's that movie that the kid came on?
He.

817
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,800
Billy Corbin did.
Oh,

818
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,790
dogfight.
Yeah.

819
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,260
Then when we told them about dog 
fighting,

820
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:41,110
and you're talking about some gentleman,
you said you'd save it for the podcast.

821
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,730
This is what I was telling you.
Like,

822
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,370
do you know what happened with conor 
Mcgregor and Nate Diaz with a bottle?

823
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,320
They threw water bottles,
plastic water bottles.

824
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,873
Uh,
they got,

825
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,980
someone might've thrown a monster 
energy,

826
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:54,814
can someone throw a can see if it can 
hit you or someone you care about that 

827
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,140
would suck the water bottles,
like come on.

828
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,250
Anyway,
they got fined a $150,000

829
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,110
and it should definitely shouldn't 
fucking throw water bottles.

830
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,600
Right.
So part of me is like,

831
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,210
well if they get discouraged throwing 
water bottles,

832
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:17,500
that shit stupid.
Right?

833
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,930
But,
but did the altercation,

834
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,120
the altercations probably good for 
business.

835
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,340
The altercation.
I mean I get excited.

836
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,353
I see Nate Diaz and conor mcgregor 
screaming at each other cry and it'll 

837
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:30,160
fuck you.
No fuck you.

838
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,560
Fuck.
You can get crazy with each other.

839
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,603
It makes you excited.
And I think that generates a pay per 

840
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:36,810
view buys.
I don't think conor stupid.

841
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,210
I don't think nate stupid.
I think they're smart.

842
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,410
I think they know what they're doing 
when it comes to that kind of stuff.

843
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,930
So that's a part of the show.
I mean,

844
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:45,970
did he really think he was gonna hit him
with that water bottle?

845
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,640
You know,
fucking Nate Diaz.

846
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:49,474
It's hard to hit him with a punch.
How the fuck are you going to hit him 

847
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:54,010
with a water bottle that's coming from 
300 feet away?

848
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:56,560
He's not going to see that.
He's not going to move out of the way of

849
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,720
that water bottle,
you know?

850
00:39:58,721 --> 00:39:59,554
I mean what they decide to get upset 
about and what they don't decide to get 

851
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,820
upset about is what's weird about 
athletic commissions.

852
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,860
You know,
like one of the things they were talking

853
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:09,694
about whether or not they were going to 
test nate for his vape pen because he 

854
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:16,360
had a cbd vape pen,
which is cbd,

855
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:18,400
not even,
not even psychoactive.

856
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:19,234
It doesn't make you high,
but it does alleviate some inflammation 

857
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:23,164
and it provides people that have like 
back pain or something like that or 

858
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,410
especially after a long fight provides 
you with a little relief.

859
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:35,310
But what's crazy is the only reason why 
they would want you to not do it.

860
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:37,870
Obviously it's not performance 
enhancing.

861
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:40,300
You're not performing anymore.
The performance is over.

862
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,090
So are they protecting you from 
yourself?

863
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,250
Like what are they doing?
They,

864
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:44,860
they,
they,

865
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,693
they don't want you to do it because 
you're flaunting the fact that you're 

866
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:51,800
doing it in front of everybody.
They piss him after the CBD.

867
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,720
We'll just through smoking that.

868
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,690
I think he had already done his post 
fight thing.

869
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,290
I think you'd do that before you do the 
press conference.

870
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,820
I think.
I don't know though.

871
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,733
It's a good question.
I'm not entirely sure and they might do 

872
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:05,830
it different way differently in 
different places,

873
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,860
but either way you're not concerned 
about him.

874
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:10,840
Like what do you,
what's the issue?

875
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,550
Like what is the issue?
It's just,

876
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,413
it looks bad.
Does it look bad that he's that vapors 

877
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:16,740
coming out?
He's scared of dragons.

878
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,210
Let's see.
Bdo business went the roof then.

879
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,270
I'm sure it did and it should and it 
should room and wait,

880
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,490
wait until it becomes illegal.
We're a month away.

881
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,070
When it becomes legal then it's really 
going to go nuts.

882
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,350
It's going to be good for everybody,
but anyway,

883
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,200
so they get fucking pissed at him for 
that.

884
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,990
But the,
the connor the fine was so high.

885
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:38,690
I'm like a hundred and $50,000.
Wow.

886
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,890
Well,
you said he made $40 million.

887
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,110
Next time shut your mouth.
They won't fucking know.

888
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,150
That's true.
100.

889
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,560
You know,
even the other kid made to three mil,

890
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,500
half of that after taxes.
One point five on 50.

891
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,330
Don't really put a dent in your fucking 
thing.

892
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,370
Next time you won't throw fucking 
bottles.

893
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,413
That is.
You've got less state bowling unless 

894
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,020
they both went to Dana.
So listen,

895
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,840
this jacked up the things we like to see
it.

896
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,860
We want them to use.
Pick up the tab for them.

897
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:07,530
$300 because it came out of your fucking
and for the paper views something.

898
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:09,420
There's always 1:50
is not that bad.

899
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,730
They walked away with a ton of loot.
It's a good point.

900
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,740
It's got to be some type of 
repercussion.

901
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,500
One 50 and they can fight again in 
November.

902
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,643
Right?
Listen,

903
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,310
I got to court without a license.
10,

904
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:21,144
15 years ago in la.
First time ever I was talking on the 

905
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,060
phone like I pulled over.
He goes,

906
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:24,894
where's your license?
It didn't work that day I went down to 

907
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,970
La County.
I stepped in front of a judge by BIPAP.

908
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,560
The guy looked at me straight in the 
face.

909
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,423
She goes,
you could pay 200 and come back with 

910
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:36,930
your license will give me 50 and I don't
want to see you again.

911
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,160
What do you think I did?
I gave him $200.

912
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,630
Game Five,
5:50

913
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,720
and in time I got my license.
Not with a gun to my head.

914
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,813
Yeah.

915
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,730
Sometimes you pay a little extra that 
let you fight in November.

916
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,360
Now you earn next time and now you could
make up that 1:50.

917
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,450
You're earning at least they're not 
suspended for a year.

918
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,650
Yeah,
that's true.

919
00:42:58,770 --> 00:42:59,850
Here's,
here's my thought,

920
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,810
but I don't think 150 is bad.
If you've got a good charity for it.

921
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,670
The center of the charity.
Yeah.

922
00:43:05,671 --> 00:43:08,130
Instead of going to an athletic 
department,

923
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:08,930
what?
I mean,

924
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,763
I'm sure the athletic department 
department somewhere that'd be a girl's 

925
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,720
soccer team or something like that for 
that day.

926
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:17,400
I know that that's like a good thing,
right,

927
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,263
but 300,000
into their pocket is what pisses you 

928
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:24,000
off.
What they decide to get mad at.

929
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,530
And what they don't decide to get mad 
at,

930
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:28,380
because this is the thing that I found.
Do you know,

931
00:43:28,381 --> 00:43:30,540
did you watch when Floyd Day,
whether it was doing,

932
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,433
I believe it was for showtime,
they were doing one of those behind the 

933
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:36,264
scenes things at his gym and he has what
he calls doghouse fights and I just let 

934
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:48,150
me just say that this kind of thing has 
been going on in Jim's forever,

935
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,720
right?

936
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,553
They've always had gym wars and people 
have even set up and this was a thing 

937
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:58,410
that I'm pretty sure it became illegal 
in California fairly recently.

938
00:43:58,411 --> 00:43:59,244
Within the last decade.
They stopped allowing people to have 

939
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,230
what they call smokers and what a smoker
is.

940
00:44:04,231 --> 00:44:05,064
They have organized fights,
but there's not really like a lot of 

941
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:12,660
medical on hand only gets paid.
Nobody gets paid paid.

942
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,703
But it gives people valuable experience.
So used to have a lot of them in Muay 

943
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,180
Thai.
Like I used to go to them.

944
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,253
They were cool.
They would set up these little plastic 

945
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:22,620
lawn chairs.
You'd pay a small amount of money,

946
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,540
you know,
like 30 bucks or something like that.

947
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,613
And you go and you watch all these 
amateur fights and a lot of times kids 

948
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,790
are pretty fucking talented and it's fun
to watch.

949
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,660
But so always had organized jim fights.
So essentially what floyd mayweather did

950
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,563
was have his own,
like in house Jim fights like amateur 

951
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:41,814
fights.
Like they didn't even disguise the fact 

952
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:46,620
that it was a competition.
Like they weren't trying to,

953
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:49,140
uh,
they weren't trying to spar.

954
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,260
Like these guys are having fights and 
he's,

955
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,530
he was talking about how it's to the 
death.

956
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,760
It's really crazy.

957
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,253
And he has these guys.
One guy gets beat up and he's hocked 

958
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,990
seem rock bonds brother or son Seen 
Rockmont son I believe.

959
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,360
See if you could see if you can google 
who the gentleman was.

960
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,450
Comments are saying it was his brother,
but his brother,

961
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,373
maybe it's his brother.
That makes more sense because how seem 

962
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,330
Rockmont is not that old to have a kid 
that's,

963
00:45:22,331 --> 00:45:23,710
that,
you know,

964
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:24,544
like,
that developed because he looks like 

965
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:28,870
he's like in his twenties maybe is.
Anyway,

966
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:33,370
point being so this English guy beats 
up,

967
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,460
seen brock bonds,
one brother,

968
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,773
and then the mom comes back with the 
bigger brother and the English guy 

969
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:42,604
fights him to all on the same day and 
they're fighting like these 30 minute 

970
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:49,930
rounds just gets crazy

971
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,460
because during a winter and they put it 
on TV.

972
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,600
Yeah,
I mean dude,

973
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:58,340
if there's definitely.
And sorry,

974
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,070
the question was,
is that Jesus?

975
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,270
No,
I don't think there is.

976
00:46:01,271 --> 00:46:02,104
I mean there might be,
I mean floyd might reward them or 

977
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,100
something like that,
but I mean it's,

978
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,220
it's crazy shit and I mean in one way,
yeah,

979
00:46:09,221 --> 00:46:10,054
this will develop,
develop character and I don't have a 

980
00:46:12,491 --> 00:46:14,590
problem with people doing whatever they 
decide to do.

981
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:16,360
If somebody wants to fight a 30 minute 
fight,

982
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,423
I don't have a problem with that.
You should be able to do it if you want 

983
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:22,980
to.
They've been doing this.

984
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,870
Jesus love Chicago,
but the thing is some Boston when he was

985
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,510
a brown belt Galley with your buddy 
issue that this.

986
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,473
But um,
but the thing is I'm not a promoter in 

987
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:32,030
Las Vegas,
right?

988
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:32,883
That's a big difference.
That's a big difference and I'm not a 

989
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:36,790
professional fighter on television.

990
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:38,910
I'm not,
I'm,

991
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:39,480
you know,
I'm,

992
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,313
and I'm not necessarily saying there's 
anything wrong with what he did because 

993
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,630
it is a part of gym culture.
It is a part of what's made champions.

994
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,420
I mean this kind of stuff,
these,

995
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,640
this heat,
these heated battles.

996
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,953
This is a very uncomfortable reality 
that elite fighters like floyd 

997
00:46:56,351 --> 00:47:01,180
mayweather face like to be that good,
you have to be that real.

998
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,690
And for a guy like him to show like 
these kind of crazy 30 minute,

999
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:10,240
no time limit fights in the gym and put 
it on tv,

1000
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,260
it's pretty wild.
It's in and I see both sides of it.

1001
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:15,970
I totally see floyd made with a side of 
it.

1002
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:17,350
Look at him.
He feeds off that,

1003
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,543
but guess what?
That mentality is why that motherfucker 

1004
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,710
was $49.
Zero,

1005
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,020
right?
That mother,

1006
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,480
arguably the best boxer ever,
who,

1007
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,220
who got hurt less than floyd mayweather,

1008
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,233
who box people's face off that everybody
thought it was going to kill him better 

1009
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:38,710
than floyd mayweather.
When he fought my Donna and he found him

1010
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:42,370
the first time and my daughter caught 
him in one of the exchanges,

1011
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,900
like right before the bell rang and we 
were like,

1012
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:44,734
whoa.
And then they fought again the second 

1013
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:51,230
time and he just put a clinic on my 
Donna just put a clinic on him.

1014
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,320
It was like,
all of a sudden my donald was fighting a

1015
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:54,154
totally different guy,
like floyd had figured out my style or 

1016
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:02,560
decided not to fuck around this fight 
and decided to really take him seriously

1017
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:05,960
and really focus on him.
And he just beat his ass brother.

1018
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,060
Different things.
A lot of ways I agree with a lot of this

1019
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,410
shitty does,
you know?

1020
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,990
But uh,
listening to him,

1021
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,810
his emotion games off the charts,
off the charts,

1022
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,180
he's self promotion games the greatest 
of all time.

1023
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,330
He's making me more money.
He's made me laugh at night sometimes.

1024
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,700
I've watched this show and he's made me 
laugh and it said,

1025
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,880
show you watch because you don't really 
like the dude.

1026
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:29,681
I mean,
he,

1027
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,960
you know,
so I know that I would love him.

1028
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,460
I bet I love it.
I would love him.

1029
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:35,890
He's a psycho and I wanted to fight like
three times.

1030
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:36,641
I'm like,
you know what?

1031
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:38,230
The proof is in the motherfucking 
putting.

1032
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,363
Exactly.
That's it.

1033
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,010
Exactly is in the pudding.
Let them do whatever the fuck he wants.

1034
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,993
You don't.
You don't get a guy like that unless 

1035
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,124
he's a guy like that.
You don't get that $49 unless he's that 

1036
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:50,380
kind of dude,
but I think he handles it as good as any

1037
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:52,770
fucking human being that could be in 
that position.

1038
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,940
Handles it.
It's a crazy position to be in,

1039
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:57,040
to be a young guy and be worth that much
money.

1040
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,110
And you're known your nicknames.
Money.

1041
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,800
Mayweather.
I mean what the fuck?

1042
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:03,910
Names himself.
Money.

1043
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,090
He's hilarious.
I ain't got nothing wrong with you.

1044
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:10,520
If you talk shit and back at any point.
Well,

1045
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,690
if you know what I'm reading right now,
a buddy of mine gave it to me.

1046
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:15,430
Hollywood hadn't listened to you old 
enough for that.

1047
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,190
Hollywood had this.
There was a dallas cowboy.

1048
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:21,130
That was the real deal.
You understand me?

1049
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:24,070
They don't even make them like that.
No more showed up rookie day.

1050
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,950
I'll give you the article with three 
hits of acid,

1051
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,550
a gram of blow right here,
the thousand dollars in the off season.

1052
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,384
He would rent the hotel and hanging out 
with prior at the comedy store while he 

1053
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,770
would have the one was the lab would 
point the sisters.

1054
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:37,623
This was before Rick James and before 
they played the Denver Broncos in this 

1055
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,913
claim to fame,
he went on national TV and took care of 

1056
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,230
the orange crush with the Denver 
Broncos,

1057
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,064
drink that soda and he fucking crushed 
it with the juice in one hand and the 

1058
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:53,650
super bowl.
He intercepted in score.

1059
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:54,484
There's online,
back and they just fucking blow up the 

1060
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:58,330
ball with big fucking,
you know,

1061
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,530
he talks shit.
People,

1062
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,420
hey,
hey.

1063
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,063
He talks shit on Game Day.
He showed up and they threw him out 

1064
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,204
because he put fucking two fingers up 
during the game and the owner of the 

1065
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,990
cowboys.
So um,

1066
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:12,790
at that time,
what's two fingers,

1067
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,130
you can do two things.
They will lose on TV,

1068
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,670
national TV and Hollywood Henderson.
The camera came over.

1069
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,950
Instead of watching,
he advertised the towel goes,

1070
00:50:22,951 --> 00:50:24,280
Yo,
if you need these tiles.

1071
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,160
And then we'll like to receive his 
company

1072
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,450
the next day.
Tom Landry Fine Hollywood Henderson.

1073
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:35,570
And after that it was all over.
He was smoking crack and Bazookas.

1074
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:40,490
But he won the lottery in Texas.
He was a liar.

1075
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,890
He became a born again Christian.
Oh my goodness.

1076
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,380
Oh motherfucker dog.
Wow.

1077
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,460
That's a fun story.

1078
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,663
Yeah man.
I just want to be clear about all that 

1079
00:50:56,991 --> 00:51:00,230
stuff that I was saying about the floyd 
mayweather thing.

1080
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:04,430
I just think that the athletic 
commissions,

1081
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,950
you know,
like when they find people and when they

1082
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:07,784
get mad at people for stuff,
it's sometimes they do it in a very 

1083
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:15,110
heavy handed way.
And I think it's kind of obscene.

1084
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,930
Like what happened with vandelay Silva I
think is obscene.

1085
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,260
You know that story,
they banned vandelay for life.

1086
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,450
He,
he ran away from a test,

1087
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,660
which he definitely shouldn't have done,
definitely shouldn't have done.

1088
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,480
But if he was on something,
they shouldn't have been on.

1089
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,510
Suspend him as if you caught them for 
that.

1090
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:35,090
Something like suspend him for,
you know,

1091
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:38,570
maybe an extra six months because he's a
dick because he ran away from you.

1092
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,530
But you can't save for life.
He can't just take away.

1093
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,063
It was,
it wasn't that isolated incident only 

1094
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,650
vandelay.
Who was it the old way?

1095
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,010
Isolated incident.
Yeah.

1096
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,540
Vandelay wasn't as positive before.
No.

1097
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:57,880
Vandelay has never tested positive for 
ever know that.

1098
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,460
I mean it's not saying he hasn't done 
anything like in,

1099
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,950
in pride,
you know,

1100
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:02,661
ensign.
Anyway,

1101
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,494
when he's on here,
he was talking about his pride contract 

1102
00:52:06,011 --> 00:52:08,480
and he said it was and Eve Edwards at 
the same thing.

1103
00:52:08,481 --> 00:52:12,680
It said in capital letters we do not 
test first steroids.

1104
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,840
They give you a syringe on the house and
Shit.

1105
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,600
Yeah.
So I mean it's not saying that he didn't

1106
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,770
do them ever,
but he never.

1107
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,090
Vandelay never tested positive.
No.

1108
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,470
So they had no reason to suspect him 
other than,

1109
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:26,690
you know,
if you follow the sniff test,

1110
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,270
you know,
but you got no.

1111
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,710
There was no proof.
I mean,

1112
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,720
and again that's the only argument,
whether it's proof or not per se,

1113
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:35,480
it's not whether or not you think he was
guilty.

1114
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,323
I would say something.
I thought I had a like good stories 

1115
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,120
about hiding from probation officers and
shit.

1116
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:47,750
This is.
Oh,

1117
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,583
this is.
This is actual instance contract at the 

1118
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,281
bottom there.
Oh,

1119
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:53,114
here it says performance enhancing 
stimulants of steroid based family are 

1120
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:59,330
specifically excluded from the scope of 
the test.

1121
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,913
Why don't they just right have at it 
boys and gals to and so I hit 

1122
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:08,864
everybody's one probation over some 
bolder that used to fuck with me so I 

1123
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:15,230
had to hide from him from time to time,
but I've heard some stories.

1124
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:18,590
He is after about some of the Brazilian 
fighters in Shit.

1125
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:20,540
What they've done with us goes down 
there,

1126
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,790
whatever the fuck it is,
didn't Jose?

1127
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:23,624
I will stop them at the airport.
Something happened where they got their 

1128
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:29,130
fucking visas return.
The something like that.

1129
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,340
The Brazilians have a Tory is for 
fucking with these people.

1130
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,200
Fucking with them.
Something that happened,

1131
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:37,530
they were at the airport has got the 
gun.

1132
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,450
That was somebody else who had a 
problem.

1133
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,403
Well the guy came to all those gym and 
they didn't know who the guy was and 

1134
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,910
they didn't trust them.
And you got to also,

1135
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,030
I mean all suspicions decided that 
people always have,

1136
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:51,864
when someone comes to you and says 
they're going to test you for steroids 

1137
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,730
and then you don't want to take that 
test,

1138
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,870
there's always gonna be suspicion,
but that's because you're guilty,

1139
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,423
but you have to take into consideration 
the possibility that it was not 

1140
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:03,714
communicated very well,
that you might be talking about two 

1141
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:06,474
different languages and although who 
speaks a little bit of English but not 

1142
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,044
that much,
all of a sudden these meeting these 

1143
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:11,964
people and he's in Brazil and he's very 
famous so he doesn't know if he's being 

1144
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:18,570
fucked with.
He didn't know this is real.

1145
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,460
If it's random,
if they just show up,

1146
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:21,420
nobody warns you.

1147
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,490
So it's not like the UFC calls you up 
and says,

1148
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:25,140
Joseph,
how are you man?

1149
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:25,974
It's Mike from the UFC.
I just want to let you know that this 

1150
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:31,710
guy who was testing you right now for 
steroids is totally legit.

1151
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,640
No,
they just show up,

1152
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:33,474
dude.
They just show up and they don't even 

1153
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:35,064
want to present you with information.
They don't want to present you with id 

1154
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,393
like Chael Sonnen was telling a story 
about how when they tested him and how 

1155
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:41,814
bizarre it was.
Then they say they pulled them into a 

1156
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:45,120
bathroom or something like that to test 
him.

1157
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,500
Yeah,
like a,

1158
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,390
like a,
a janitor's closet or something.

1159
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,430
They tested them in a janitor's closet 
and he's like,

1160
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:52,370
what the fuck?
You're drawing my blood.

1161
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,080
And he's like,
it turned out to actually be Usada.

1162
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:55,943
He goes,
but it could easily have been just some 

1163
00:54:56,851 --> 00:55:00,030
fucking crazy person who just wanted my 
blood and my piss,

1164
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:00,900
you know?

1165
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,490
I mean,
you don't know.

1166
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,360
It's not what happened with Tim Kennedy.
What happened with him?

1167
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,120
That they went over to his house and he 
came home from the gym.

1168
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:09,871
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1169
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:11,690
yeah.
And the guy made him take a shower.

1170
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,290
I don't know how to read the whole 
thing.

1171
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,620
They couldn't do the test for like an 
hour for some reason.

1172
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,990
I don't know.
I don't remember what the reason was.

1173
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,633
Or maybe the guy had to get the test 
brought over or something and the guy 

1174
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,380
goes,
I have to keep an eye on it.

1175
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:26,131
He goes,
really well,

1176
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:26,964
listen.
He goes,

1177
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,103
I might take a shower.
I just got done training and that's 

1178
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,680
actually if you.
Especially if you're doing Jujitsu,

1179
00:55:31,681 --> 00:55:32,514
it's actually really important that you 
jump in the shower because you get 

1180
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:38,010
scratches and those scratches on your 
body.

1181
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:38,844
You can get staff on those and staff 
lives in your nose and it lives in 

1182
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:46,380
saliva and it lives in like when you're.
You're doing Jujitsu,

1183
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:51,390
you're awash in bacteria.
A hold weapon.

1184
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,520
Gunpoint is this guy showed up in his 
driveway.

1185
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,140
When is.
This is an August.

1186
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,720
Oh my God.
Demands to know who he is.

1187
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:03,330
A little story on it.
Holy Shit.

1188
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,710
These motherfuckers are coming over like
the cubes to your house.

1189
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,420
If you ever drive down Tim Kennedy's 
block mixture.

1190
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,780
He knows who the hell you are.

1191
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,700
They come on you.
You can't do that shit y'all.

1192
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:21,900
You can't pull up slowly pulling up to 
Kennedy's driveway and parking his car.

1193
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:24,040
The side of the collector was at the

1194
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,030
wrong end of a barrel.
Whoa.

1195
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,240
He demanded know who he was.
It looks like Kennedy is cleaning up the

1196
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:34,840
streets as you saw to tries to clean and
professional mixed martial arts.

1197
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:39,930
Wow.
Wow.

1198
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:40,974
That is crazy.
Saying that he thought that Usada Rep 

1199
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,300
might be a terrorist disguised as a 
urine collector.

1200
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,740
Wow.
That's funny.

1201
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,503
Yeah.
That's a dangerous guy to sneak up on 

1202
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,280
you.
GotTa.

1203
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,180
Be Real careful.

1204
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:59,690
That's not a guy you want to fucking.
He's gotta be a little Diaz.

1205
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,193
Didn't let him in stone sleep and a lot 
of people don't like the idea of just 

1206
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,424
being stopped.
Like you have to always worry about 

1207
00:57:10,381 --> 00:57:11,214
that.
That's an added element that you think 

1208
00:57:12,451 --> 00:57:15,000
of that you have to be stopped in the 
middle of your sleep.

1209
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,043
Someone can wake you up at 7:30
in the morning thing done and you have 

1210
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:23,040
to give them blood and piss right there.
It has to deal.

1211
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:27,230
So you've lost lot and I think so.
I think.

1212
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,690
I think at the very least are tasting.
They're testing blood.

1213
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,330
I know Nevada was doing urine to.
Well,

1214
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,173
if they're still doing urine,
but the more stringent tests apparently 

1215
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,690
are all blood based,

1216
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,330
it's um,
you know,

1217
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:47,790
you have to give them a schedule where 
you're going with time.

1218
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:49,770
You're training.
Cowboy got in trouble.

1219
00:57:49,771 --> 00:57:50,910
That's tough.
That's tough.

1220
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,040
Probably got in trouble because they 
said we're at your ranch.

1221
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:53,610
He goes,
well,

1222
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:57,070
I'm at the UFC and he's like,
you have to let us know where you going.

1223
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:57,720
It goes,
well,

1224
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,090
doesn't the UFC tell you I'm going to be
here?

1225
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,650
He's like,
this is where I'm going.

1226
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,410
Like I'm promoting the UFC.
I'm here for the UFC.

1227
00:58:04,411 --> 00:58:06,630
I got a fight coming up.
That's why I'm there.

1228
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,783
Like they didn't tell you I was going to
be there and so they have to warn him 

1229
00:58:10,261 --> 00:58:11,094
and give him like,
you're a bad boy because we didn't know 

1230
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:14,250
where you were.
We'll send someone here,

1231
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:16,230
mother Fucker,
you know where he is now.

1232
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:16,830
I'm here,
right?

1233
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,663
Yeah.
But he apparently he had to like give 

1234
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,540
them his schedule,
like no matter where you,

1235
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,480
where you're going,
you know I'm going to go fishing,

1236
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,500
I'm going to be on this river.

1237
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,210
Okay.
We're going to show up,

1238
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,090
come down there,
the river on a mountain bike,

1239
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,980
and uh,
try to collect your pets or your blood.

1240
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,270
You have no idea what life is when they 
get tracked.

1241
00:58:36,271 --> 00:58:37,530
The second,
the second like that.

1242
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,450
Oh,
it must be hard to fucking nightmare.

1243
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,313
What is this Jamie?
They have an APP now so that they can 

1244
00:58:42,241 --> 00:58:45,000
check in.
You type in like,

1245
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,890
oh my God.
Oh my God.

1246
00:58:49,891 --> 00:58:53,070
That's so crazy.
That's so crazy.

1247
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,250
That's how far we have to go to keep 
people from doing steroids.

1248
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,970
Can I track them?
Track them.

1249
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,100
Like you're going to follow them with a 
drone.

1250
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,530
When they came to my house,
I was a criminal.

1251
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,630
I'd given up my right.
That's,

1252
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,020
it's so fucking bizarre.
And they would show up.

1253
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,740
This one dude had it out for me because 
I told you I put the,

1254
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,460
the fucking out the south during the 
pistol one time and I fucked them up.

1255
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,630
So now there's little southern guy would
come to me,

1256
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,250
show up at my job.

1257
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,360
Fucking everywhere.
Hmm.

1258
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,910
Like twice.
I gave him pissed,

1259
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:29,540
but at least I got to talk to him.
He said he wasn't a bad guy,

1260
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,403
he wasn't like a heavy at all.
The one time I just wouldn't let them 

1261
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:34,634
in.
And then he followed me for a probation 

1262
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:37,790
violation,
but I proved that wasn't.

1263
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:42,791
That was at the airport and so yeah,
it's when someone,

1264
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,670
I can't do it no more.
I couldn't do that.

1265
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,980
That would put you in a weird position 
with that person.

1266
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,270
No,
you have no idea.

1267
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:53,570
There's people who come out of prison,
they put them in that situation and they

1268
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:56,030
fail and they go right back to prison 
and they'll tell you,

1269
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:59,830
I never want to be in a halfway house 
situation again because it's too,

1270
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,270
you know,
it's not really freedom.

1271
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,610
It's not really freedom in a way,
you know,

1272
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:08,930
at that level of sharing their weaning 
you off of freedom.

1273
01:00:08,931 --> 01:00:10,580
That's why it's a halfway house.
Right.

1274
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:11,031
So,
okay,

1275
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:12,560
I'm at the gym.
I leave work.

1276
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:16,100
I got to call them and say I'm headed 
over to a 10th planet HQ.

1277
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,650
What's the address?
Six O two,

1278
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,900
whatever.
And then as I'm leaving now,

1279
01:00:19,901 --> 01:00:21,140
let's say you go,
okay,

1280
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,483
we're going to go over across the street
to get a protein shake and when you go 

1281
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:25,994
over to their places closed,
so he'd go next door or something like 

1282
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:29,840
that.
They can violate you for that.

1283
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,990
Yeah,
it's tough to,

1284
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,873
you know,
no Bible.

1285
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:37,843
It's working,
but it's working and it makes you 

1286
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:41,080
accountable.
Yeah.

1287
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,340
It makes you accountable.
Important thing when you're,

1288
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,213
you're definitely gonna eliminate 90 
something percent of the people that'd 

1289
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,210
be willing to take a chance and take a 
steroid.

1290
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,433
But then there's always the possibility 
that there's people that are ahead of 

1291
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,380
the curve,
you know,

1292
01:00:56,381 --> 01:00:58,160
like we can't think that,
you know,

1293
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,160
all those times when they,
uh,

1294
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,123
had that clear stuff.
When Victor Conte was using that stuff 

1295
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:04,904
on his athletes that was undetectable,
they would call it the clear and then 

1296
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:11,480
they figured out what the clear was and 
now now you can test for it.

1297
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,210
But back then nobody had a test for it.
But once,

1298
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,343
once they find tests for whatever the 
fuck people are using now that are 

1299
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:19,730
skirting around tasks,
we're going to go,

1300
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,470
oh,
we thought those guys were clean.

1301
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:23,780
Like there's going to be a certain 
percentage,

1302
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:26,300
whatever that percentage is,
but it's 10 percent.

1303
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,960
There's always going to be a percent 
that's trying something.

1304
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:33,680
There's always going to be a percent 
that's willing to try something.

1305
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,050
It's just out of all the people that we 
know are clean,

1306
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:36,913
if there's 100 people,
is it one guy that takes a chance and 

1307
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:40,514
does something weird and then gets 
caught a few years later when they 

1308
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:44,054
figured out a test for it might be fake.
The coffee was taken into the different 

1309
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:47,290
levels.
Oh,

1310
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,750
he was in the sixth day.
Yeah.

1311
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,370
Couple of.
Yeah.

1312
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:53,310
And they,
they would be out of your system.

1313
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:54,510
Yes.
Yeah,

1314
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,540
in the sixth inning.
Now let me ask you a question.

1315
01:01:56,541 --> 01:02:00,020
I know you're not going to say,
I know Jamie's been watching lately.

1316
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,213
Jamie,
tell me the truth as pete rose been 

1317
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:04,640
killing it lately.
Tell me the truth.

1318
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,593
He rose.
What do you mean he'd been killed on 

1319
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:08,720
national TV?
Repeat Baseball player.

1320
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:11,810
What's he doing?
He's doing like this analyzing,

1321
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,510
but they got him and Alex Rodriguez.
Oh my God.

1322
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:19,380
They killed Joe Rogan.
You've got this is 2016.

1323
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,050
Pete rose with a bow tie because pete 
rose.

1324
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,213
No matter I've never been mad at p rose.
Remember Pete Rose was one of my heroes 

1325
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:28,650
though.
Pete rose my heroes.

1326
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,170
I've never gotten mad at Pete rose.
He's human,

1327
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,453
but in a way how they treat them.
But he was a junkie and he was a piece 

1328
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:37,020
of shift for awhile.
Like he was a gambling junkie,

1329
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:38,730
you know,
he was a piece of shit for a while,

1330
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,430
but enough fees.
Fucking Pete rose dog.

1331
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,870
He's,
I'm telling you.

1332
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:45,600
I watched this show one night and I was 
dying.

1333
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,793
How funny.
He is like how crazy is and they're 

1334
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:52,410
going to keep them around Fox.
I hope they fucking do well.

1335
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,670
Did you ever watch him?
Joe?

1336
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:55,080
Anything?
Look,

1337
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:01,870
that's classic.
How old is Pete Rose Now?

1338
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:08,100
Fifties or sixties.
Sixties.

1339
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,440
I just feel bad that you know,
there was a,

1340
01:03:12,441 --> 01:03:15,600
all the speculation that he had done 75.
Wow.

1341
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,070
Just.
Yeah,

1342
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,200
there was all that speculation that he 
had,

1343
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,600
um,
gambled on his own team,

1344
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,180
but I don't think that was ever shown.
Listen,

1345
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,550
you have to assume I'm a gambling.
You do me a favor.

1346
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:28,710
Jamie,
can you put up for Joe Rogan?

1347
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:32,820
Can you put up pete rose against ron 
bone and the all star game?

1348
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,670
This is when you.
I had to show people at a bar one that I

1349
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:38,200
go,
you never know who pete rose is not.

1350
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,960
Let me just show you pete rose's.
Pete Rose Tackles Ron.

1351
01:03:41,961 --> 01:03:43,590
Boom.
But the beauty of this,

1352
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,190
it's an all star game.
You never saw this German now.

1353
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,940
Oh,
look at you.

1354
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:52,350
You're beside yourself.
Oh No,

1355
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:53,770
no,
because I get allergies.

1356
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,280
Jesus.
Shit.

1357
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,113
The afternoon.
Oh,

1358
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,700
look at this.
Look.

1359
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,630
All right.
This is this guy.

1360
01:03:57,631 --> 01:04:00,420
How he played like this guy wasn't 
American savage.

1361
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,240
Who's a barbarian?
Charlie.

1362
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,960
This is crazy.
This is still the look at it.

1363
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,960
Oh my God.
He just took him out.

1364
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,590
He tells them don't ever blocked that 
fucking basic gun cock sucker.

1365
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,260
Oh,
look at this shit.

1366
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,890
Like he was the last of the real fucking
Americans.

1367
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:26,891
He fucked up yet I'm a gambler.
And he wrecked that dude.

1368
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:35,160
He literally tackled him.
Oh my God.

1369
01:04:35,161 --> 01:04:37,980
Full shoulder down.
Now,

1370
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:39,960
here's the beauty.
If you put on yelled at him,

1371
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,880
let me tell you something.
Nineteen 73.

1372
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:45,720
I was 10 years old and I went to see the
mets against the Cincinnati reds.

1373
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:48,960
I was in my fucking haven.
It was the fucking all star game.

1374
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:51,850
It was the National League,
uh,

1375
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:54,120
Eastern Conference.
And he beat up.

1376
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,480
But housing the second I left there.
Look at us.

1377
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,370
I left there.
So fucking happy.

1378
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:01,790
I went there with my mom,
my stepdad.

1379
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,800
We was sitting behind Tony Perez family 
and Pete rose is beaten up on bud house.

1380
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,370
And I left there with my fucking 
dickhead.

1381
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,020
That chicken pox.
I had the chicken pox.

1382
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:14,670
I went to that game with the fucking 
chicken pox.

1383
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,760
So here's my question to you.
How come this can happen today?

1384
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:22,090
How come the guy can't run into the guy 
at home base today?

1385
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,990
That would be a suspension three months 
especially for suspension is nothing,

1386
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:29,590
right?
Nothing.

1387
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,710
And that was one of the greatest.
Look at that team right there.

1388
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,540
That's playing.
That's one of the greatest.

1389
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:36,630
You'll never see anything like that.
Yeah.

1390
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,190
That's New York City.
This is fucking tremendous.

1391
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,020
Oh my goodness.
This is awesome.

1392
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:44,200
What a fight to cut it off.
What a terrible time to edit it.

1393
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,970
That was just.
It was just getting good.

1394
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,103
Yeah.
[inaudible] gotten a bunch of his 

1395
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:48,484
fights,
right?

1396
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,220
Fist fight to use to tackle you at 
second,

1397
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,390
but you know,
he played baseball.

1398
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,440
He Played Cincinnati.
Somebody would get hurt on Cincinnati.

1399
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:57,274
Reds and bench would automatically go to
first and plumber would play like a 

1400
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,740
plumber was like fucking God.
And he sat by,

1401
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:06,574
you know,
it was just a trump meeting with me and 

1402
01:06:07,691 --> 01:06:08,524
Goldberg get together.
We talk about the Cincinnati reds 

1403
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:14,260
because I grew up on him,
but at this point I think I don't give a

1404
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,970
fuck about the hall of fame for Pete 
Rose.

1405
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,050
I know he gambled on his own thing,
but if you don't,

1406
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:22,150
if you know any history of gambling and 
professional sports,

1407
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:23,110
guess what?
Joe Rogan,

1408
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:26,290
the role loses.
They all lose a ton of money.

1409
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:31,540
Tons of money from arch leads to to 
fucking Pete rose.

1410
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,330
There was another one that used to bet 
on,

1411
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,203
you know,
these arch leaf that didn't get caught 

1412
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:37,670
betting on himself,
but he,

1413
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:39,700
he,
he's known to fucking lose everything.

1414
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:40,534
I'm professional gambling.
These guys all called right from 

1415
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:43,780
downstairs.
The only thing,

1416
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:46,750
they're the only ones who did it.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

1417
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:51,670
I have a brother who's a fucking moron,
but he's married to my sister and I know

1418
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:54,790
he's a dumb fucking loser gambler.
I can't call him and say to him,

1419
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,800
listen,
fucking Malique Shaw,

1420
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,630
his ankles hurt and tonight bet against 
them.

1421
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,411
You know,
whatever.

1422
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:00,244
I can't.

1423
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,350
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

1424
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,080
a lot of fucking people do it.
Pete rose,

1425
01:07:05,081 --> 01:07:07,410
they hate him.
He used to tell him,

1426
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,980
fuck you.
When you play like that,

1427
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:10,323
what do you think?
You don't think your rest of your life 

1428
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:12,244
is telling people to go fuck themselves.
Who does that in 1973 and an all star 

1429
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:17,244
game doesn't mean anything.
So the players didn't like him like 

1430
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:21,170
that.
He,

1431
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,130
he was against the fucking system like 
since day one.

1432
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,640
Then he went and he became a player when
he was gambling on himself.

1433
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:29,350
He was a player manager.
Supposedly.

1434
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:30,670
What's.
Oh okay.

1435
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:33,030
A player manager,
but me and my gambling mind,

1436
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,490
he been gambling the whole time.
You know what I'm saying?

1437
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:39,550
That's not to say that it just,
he just started gambling one day.

1438
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,633
He been gambling the whole time because 
in the seventies it was a little less 

1439
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:44,254
frowned upon.

1440
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,770
What do you like to dad got this horse 
and the third.

1441
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,090
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1442
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:49,983
And one day that basketball baton,
that football bet becomes a baseball 

1443
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:53,321
bat.
Well,

1444
01:07:53,321 --> 01:07:56,260
people had bookies were really common.
Common.

1445
01:07:56,261 --> 01:07:59,110
Everybody had a book.
It's less common today.

1446
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,073
Yes.
Today because everything's done on 

1447
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:03,130
computers and people could do stuff like
that.

1448
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:03,964
But,
uh,

1449
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,310
30 years ago,
August,

1450
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,203
this skinny guy would look at the bar.
You went to [inaudible] and that's the 

1451
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:11,350
book that here,
what do you want to do?

1452
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:12,184
You give them cash after three or four 
or five weeks starts letting you bet on 

1453
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:17,930
credit.
What do you think they're worried about?

1454
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,970
Why they keep gambling like that?
Illegal.

1455
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,920
Do you think they're worried we're just 
going to go crazy.

1456
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,950
Just gambled all the money away.
Like what are they worried about?

1457
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,290
Like why is it.
Why?

1458
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,460
Why would you protect someone from 
gambling?

1459
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,610
Wait you.
Are you trying to keep people prosperous

1460
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,850
by removing the threat?
They can't do it.

1461
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:35,684
So because they can't do it.
A lot of people who'd fallen into 

1462
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:37,874
gambling won't because we're going to 
protect them from themselves because 

1463
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:41,870
that doesn't seem to make any sense to 
me.

1464
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,480
Some states look upon it like when I was
a kid,

1465
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:45,723
no reasonable.
My parents did numbers and the city is 

1466
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,820
because they gave you a ticket in the 
city and a felony in jersey,

1467
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,313
so we'll wait a second.
Joey would all those degenerate 

1468
01:08:53,621 --> 01:08:54,454
motherfuckers in the tristate area.
What you're telling me is if you got 

1469
01:08:57,351 --> 01:09:01,040
arrested for gambling in New York City 
in the seventies and eighties,

1470
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:01,963
you got a ticket.

1471
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:05,100
The Cop said,
what are we going to do?

1472
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,743
I've got a thousand of these 
motherfuckers popping apartment 

1473
01:09:08,341 --> 01:09:11,820
buildings all over the place.
If you went to Harlem in the seventies,

1474
01:09:11,821 --> 01:09:14,220
it was all little bodegas and everybody 
took action,

1475
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,590
whether it was numbers.
The next,

1476
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,220
the Brooklyn number,
the Roosevelt number.

1477
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,540
Remember there's five numbers that come 
out and fucking New York.

1478
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:24,180
They haven't told you.
My grandmother got arrested.

1479
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,130
Yes.
You run the numbers.

1480
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,173
You run numbers.
It's something that you do in the 

1481
01:09:28,141 --> 01:09:30,180
neighborhood.
You become a part of it.

1482
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:31,050
You gotta accept.
Okay.

1483
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,670
For years.
Okay.

1484
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:33,570
Everybody.
Well,

1485
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,830
I did.
I don't know about you.

1486
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:35,970
Once a month.
Let's pump.

1487
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,930
Even if I over exaggerate once a month,
somebody would pull me aside and go,

1488
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:42,360
hey man,
you know anybody who wants to sneakers.

1489
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,160
What do you got?
Yeah,

1490
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:45,540
I got commerce.
Okay.

1491
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,600
They usually go for 20 for you.
I'll give to you for seven.

1492
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:52,680
You don't even ask.
You just know they're stolen.

1493
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:55,710
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not going to embarrass you.

1494
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:58,080
You come to my house.
You're my friend,

1495
01:09:58,081 --> 01:09:58,860
right?
Jo,

1496
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,290
you come to my house.
Joe,

1497
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,451
how you doing?
Hi.

1498
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:03,750
This is kind of embarrassing.
My cousin,

1499
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:06,570
he owns a store and he's having a sale 
on TVS.

1500
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:08,730
I know it's 6:00,
it's a little late,

1501
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:11,730
but the trend,
the trends that 400 brand new,

1502
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,830
I need 100.
They're in a box with a warranty.

1503
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,143
Christmas is coming.

1504
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,380
You didn't ask him that.
Stolen.

1505
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:22,490
That's a regular fucking day for a guy 
in Pittsburgh,

1506
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:23,763
Connecticut.
Is that more of an east coast thing 

1507
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,770
where people come to you with the open 
van?

1508
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,480
Well,
I'm not an open van.

1509
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:31,280
I'm talking not people,
not strangers.

1510
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,480
I'm talking about Jamie.
Jamie and Jamie's got a cousin that gets

1511
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,150
watches.
He gets the best watch in the world.

1512
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:43,020
My lamp on top $52,000.
But Jamie get them to 22 cash.

1513
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,880
Went 2020 goals to the guy and Jamie 
gets to off the top.

1514
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,103
Are you going to torture Jamie and 
embarrassing like so when did you get 

1515
01:10:51,021 --> 01:10:52,040
this?
Am I going to get arrested?

1516
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,903
No.
Give him the 22 grand and move on with 

1517
01:10:54,441 --> 01:10:56,540
your fucking life.
Right?

1518
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,870
Is that bad Karma?
I who know.

1519
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,110
Buy Stolen goods?
No,

1520
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:04,760
because Martha gets the insurance back 
from you and they get an even higher.

1521
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,650
They get,
they get the retail back.

1522
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,980
Don't even get the wholesale totally 
makes out.

1523
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,073
If you take it off,
somebody is watching him put a gun to 

1524
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:12,254
his head,
then you've got to bump into something 

1525
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:13,980
bad,
right?

1526
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,813
The physical act of taking from a 
person's digital from no matter what 

1527
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:17,994
this something involved,
but you don't have nothing to do with 

1528
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,840
it.
Somebody shows up at your doorstep.

1529
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:24,900
It's two weeks away from Christmas.
What a surprise.

1530
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:29,310
You have the Nintendo game my son wants,
or the ps three or the PS.

1531
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:33,390
How much of those things brand new,
much 300 brand new.

1532
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:35,550
I show up at your house for a buck and a
quarter with three of them.

1533
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:36,923
You're going to take all three of them.
I know a dude who thought he was buying 

1534
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:40,740
a stereo,
but he's actually buying bricks.

1535
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,900
He got one of those stereotypes that 
he's a footpath a moment.

1536
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,610
He stopped at the street and bought it 
from a guy named Jamal.

1537
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,620
I had a guy.
I was buying pet food.

1538
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:52,560
I pulled into this parking spot.
I got out and this dude literally opened

1539
01:11:52,561 --> 01:11:54,660
the van like he was going to take me in 
and fuck me.

1540
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:55,494
Like I was like some little kid.
He was about to scoop up out of the 

1541
01:11:57,031 --> 01:11:59,820
woods and like it was a molester and I'm
like,

1542
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:00,990
what?
Like what do you,

1543
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,190
what do you got?
And he's like,

1544
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,840
stereotypes,
you want to buy a stereo?

1545
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,820
I was like,
this is the weirdest.

1546
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:06,763
He's.
He opened up the door like as people 

1547
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:11,040
parked the car and like it was literally
like,

1548
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,570
Hey man,
you want some of this?

1549
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,553
Like what?
You're asking for trouble if you do 

1550
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:16,680
business.
One of those guys,

1551
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,610
that's the most obvious shit ever.
You know?

1552
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:22,890
He's just randomly trying to sell a 
stereo to the back of a van.

1553
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:23,843
Now.
What are these things that they do in 

1554
01:12:25,461 --> 01:12:27,600
whatever,
like the people go when they have,

1555
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:30,240
what do they call junk at sea?
When I was a trunk.

1556
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:30,811
It's.
No,

1557
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:31,021
no,
no,

1558
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:31,854
I'm sorry.
The thing off the fucking five that you 

1559
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:37,440
always see in the movies and all the 
fucking Friday,

1560
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:41,850
they all go to a place and they.
They buy stereos and raider hats.

1561
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,210
Swap swap me.
Oh yeah.

1562
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:49,150
Well in that way it's a swap me in 
Jersey that called,

1563
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,600
what do they call you?
Market?

1564
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,040
Something like that.
Yeah.

1565
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:57,720
I used to go to where they used to do 
the bicycles,

1566
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:58,554
whatever those street car races and next
door to it they had whatever it was 

1567
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:06,720
called and you'd go there and they had 
pretty much shit that was stolen.

1568
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,123
It was just a festival and they tries to
a table fee because everything was 50 

1569
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:15,480
percent off.
Even the sneakers I remember and then we

1570
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:16,314
found that that the guy would go to the 
fucking factory and jumped over the 

1571
01:13:19,651 --> 01:13:24,000
fence and take over the sneakers.
No mistakes.

1572
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:30,300
Irregulars.
They would take those and just sell them

1573
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:33,240
at those for swap,
swap meets,

1574
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,850
and then we find that we cut into his 
action.

1575
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:36,900
I just want it done.
We,

1576
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:40,060
we,
we cut into that action and the action,

1577
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,550
they're not going to.
Those tubes are blocked best prank.

1578
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,380
They would throw thousands of amount 
with little things like the chemical was

1579
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:47,860
off.
You start blinking too much,

1580
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,400
like the chemical would be off.
Then it was pepper spray,

1581
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,073
pepper spray,
like people would spray and you can see 

1582
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:58,610
what happened.
It's not regular but binocular.

1583
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:01,190
What does that tear gas.
It was like the tickets.

1584
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,073
The Spanish kid that was advertising and
we make them jump the fence and we'd 

1585
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:13,150
have thousands of tubes and we'd sell 
them for fifty cents a piece on Monday,

1586
01:14:13,151 --> 01:14:13,984
the sixth and seventh grade virus,
but there wasn't always three kids that 

1587
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:17,494
complain.
There was a little like the chemical 

1588
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:23,461
imbalance was all delirious.
Yeah.

1589
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:29,650
There's more shenanigans and the east 
coast it seems like,

1590
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,350
but no,
you know,

1591
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:34,120
cut into that sneaker business who Ross 
Ross dress for less.

1592
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:35,283
All those companies that you go in the 
genes of 20 percent off because there's 

1593
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:38,584
a regular stitch now.
They became the fucking junkets for 

1594
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:42,274
those.
You know how you have a friend that has 

1595
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:48,190
a bit and then that bit is always 
connected to that place.

1596
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:51,220
Like Ross dress for less is sebastian 
where every time you go to.

1597
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,650
Sometimes I'll even go to Ross because I
think it's a bathroom.

1598
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,730
I mean that's like I can't see Ross 
dress for less.

1599
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:02,110
Ross dress for less.
Does that a little bit about.

1600
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:02,944
Is this mountain the flip flops shoes 
pull shit off the shelf and just fuck 

1601
01:15:09,741 --> 01:15:11,200
it.
Throws it down the aisle.

1602
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,150
That's a funny bit,
but it's one of those.

1603
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:17,020
It just cemented in your head.
If you think about Ross dress for less,

1604
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,300
like what are the.
There's gotTa be other bits like that,

1605
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:22,000
right?
Like okay,

1606
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:22,983
Roller Derby's or roller skating rinks.
I take my daughter to a rollerskating 

1607
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,450
things,
a little party in a roller skating rink.

1608
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:29,284
Every skates around.
You know what I think about Bret Ernst 

1609
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:33,550
and it's crazy.
Roller Skater bit.

1610
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:36,760
Remember that bit about the old dude.
That was really good.

1611
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,670
That would go to the skating rink and 
skate backwards.

1612
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:42,200
It's fuck it was.
I mean he,

1613
01:15:42,201 --> 01:15:44,340
he isn't the east coast.
Did you ever go rogue?

1614
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,070
Escape that one of those places on 
Sunday with Guido and cousin vinny?

1615
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:49,103
No,
I missed a lot of stuff because once I 

1616
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:52,084
got into martial arts I didn't want to 
do anything that would hurt me outside 

1617
01:15:54,461 --> 01:15:56,650
of martial arts because I didn't want to
get hurt.

1618
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,770
So I didn't want to ski.
He didn't want to ride motorcycles,

1619
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,360
didn't.
I didn't want to skate.

1620
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:03,730
I didn't rollerskate I didn't do it.
I did an ice skate.

1621
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,360
I don't know how to ice skate.
No,

1622
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,960
fuck you.
I bowled.

1623
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,870
I got a bowling ball at some point in 
the game.

1624
01:16:10,871 --> 01:16:12,940
That wasn't bad.
I'd go to the Bronx and bowl.

1625
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:14,463
I rolled a skate if I went like three 
times in the seventh grade and like a 

1626
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,900
Paramus,
paramus,

1627
01:16:19,901 --> 01:16:21,580
New Jersey,
and like a roller rink.

1628
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:26,290
And it was the one that was just.
Oh really?

1629
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:28,080
Staying alive and yeah.

1630
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:32,670
You know,
first I was afraid I was petrified he,

1631
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,663
Brett would do this bit and he would do 
it with music and they would flash the 

1632
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:40,420
lights and shit and he would,
uh,

1633
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,060
I don't want to give it away.
I don't think he does anymore.

1634
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:44,950
But if you haven't seen it,
go find it.

1635
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:47,020
If it's online somewhere,
it's serious.

1636
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,033
I used to go to the one and I took me 
were older than I was and for me it was 

1637
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:53,854
just to skate around for them.
It was to pick up checks you following 

1638
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,720
me and they would get all dressed up and
shit and then they would roll around and

1639
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:03,840
if you want up to a girl and ask her to 
roller skate.

1640
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,470
That was the beginning of the 
relationship,

1641
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:06,813
that type of shit.
And they played disco music and I went 

1642
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:11,000
like three times.
It wasn't for me,

1643
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,120
but the best thing.

1644
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,700
I had a wig and he fell and the weight 
fell off everybody surrounding them.

1645
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:19,550
And that was my highlight of the fucking
roller skating rink.

1646
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:24,050
I never went back to the this game.
What did you know?

1647
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,243
They,
you just.

1648
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:26,443
Did you have a point in your life where 
you knew that you were going to be a 

1649
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:30,950
comic?
Did you have like a.

1650
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:32,203
But did you ever like look back at 
moments like that where the guy falls 

1651
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:36,674
down,
his wig falls off and it's a fucking 

1652
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,310
your favorite part of the day?
No,

1653
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,203
that's.
That was the whole thing like you left 

1654
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,090
irrational.
I love laughing.

1655
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,900
Yeah,
I know you do.

1656
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,990
I love laughing at the fucking most 
absurd.

1657
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:53,480
Like when I saw a guy get him on a 
snowball in New York City on a bus,

1658
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:54,403
like when people throw snowballs at each
other and I was in the back of the bus 

1659
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,124
and this guy sat in the area where 
people get hit with snowballs and the 

1660
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:01,694
window was open.

1661
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,280
I don't mind.
This motherfucker's going to get hit.

1662
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:05,114
I'm going to forget.
It was like Deja Vu and all of a sudden 

1663
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,590
sitting in the back of the bus and this 
guy's happy.

1664
01:18:09,591 --> 01:18:11,020
He's talking in Italian,
blah,

1665
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:11,470
blah,
blah,

1666
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,420
blah.
He was like a tourist.

1667
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,593
He was a tourist Italian and it was the 
day after the storm and these coasts 

1668
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,410
where it's sunny out and that snow's 
melting,

1669
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:23,170
but kids are rapping.
I don't have school and they're throwing

1670
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,970
snowballs.
I got to the boulevard and this guy gets

1671
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:27,620
on the bus,
doesn't close the window.

1672
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:28,454
Rule number one.
Soon as you can in those Kennedy 

1673
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:30,543
Boulevard,
you closed the fucking window track 

1674
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:35,030
because there's an area.
Then it becomes like apocalypse now.

1675
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,303
Then when they threw spears,
then when they went on the lake and 

1676
01:18:38,201 --> 01:18:41,050
launched and they got really fucked up,
they started getting hit with speeds.

1677
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:44,840
That's how I would get hit with 
snowballs and I saw at Joe Rogan,

1678
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,133
that guy sitting down laughing and all 
of a sudden you can hear the right in 

1679
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:54,560
the fucking face and knocked them off 
the chair.

1680
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,083
He was in the aisle seat and he went 
into the middle and he got up and he 

1681
01:18:58,371 --> 01:18:59,204
kept saying stop,
but the bus stop or the bus and I'm 

1682
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:05,210
fucking island with my little buddies in
the back,

1683
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:06,980
you know,
Shit like that.

1684
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:10,160
You cannot write like,
like as a child,

1685
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:14,420
the things you saw like the time I went 
to the haunted house,

1686
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,430
they take you to like,
oh,

1687
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,423
bring them teen castle haunted house.
Me and a bunch of little white Italian 

1688
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,510
kids were crazy but wouldn't nice 
people.

1689
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,430
But like three of us thought we were bad
at.

1690
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:28,700
I'm bad boy.
We didn't know is that night east orange

1691
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:29,534
was coming to one of those black 
neighborhoods and they got off the bus 

1692
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:33,043
and were walking behind them that I seen
one of the kids just start wailing on 

1693
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:39,150
Dracula,
just beat my drag.

1694
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,850
When you're 13 and you think you're a 
bad motherfucker,

1695
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,060
but some do the beat and Dracula and the
Brigham,

1696
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:47,650
Teen Castle,
you can't write that shit light.

1697
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:50,090
That'll stay with me forever.
Seeing that in the haunted house.

1698
01:19:50,091 --> 01:19:50,924
Till this day I don't go to haunted 
houses because some these kids beat up 

1699
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:55,070
dracula.
Then they were pulling them out,

1700
01:19:55,071 --> 01:19:55,904
Joe Rogan and kicking him and shit.
Nobody in the other goals are trying to 

1701
01:20:00,141 --> 01:20:03,170
help him.
This only happens in Jersey.

1702
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:04,004
You can't describe these animal 
experiences while we were just talking 

1703
01:20:06,441 --> 01:20:09,720
about what happened at a rangers game.
Oh yeah.

1704
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:10,554
Before we you.
You were talking about this before the 

1705
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:13,080
podcast.
I'm glad you brought that up,

1706
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:17,250
but about the raiders come into Vegas 
and he retired.

1707
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,720
What happened recently?
The raiders game,

1708
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:21,330
Jamie,
where some guy got beaten into a coma.

1709
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:23,900
Critical.

1710
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,280
Well,
this was an earlier this month,

1711
01:20:25,281 --> 01:20:26,114
October.
It was in critical condition after a 

1712
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:29,060
ravens,
raiders game,

1713
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:33,260
30 percent chance to survive and two 
guys got arrested.

1714
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,030
Yeah,
they just beat him up.

1715
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:36,513
Yeah.
They didn't know what the story was at 

1716
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:38,414
the time of this was written.
It was unclear why the altercation 

1717
01:20:40,311 --> 01:20:41,144
started.
They just started fighting on their way 

1718
01:20:42,081 --> 01:20:42,914
out the game.
Tom knows then who knows what happened 

1719
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,700
if that's the case,
but it two on one,

1720
01:20:49,701 --> 01:20:50,534
but I mean who even knows what happened?
Who knows what we're talking about the 

1721
01:20:53,961 --> 01:20:57,250
violence that these games from Russia 
came to this.

1722
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:00,240
Is that a preseason at a game?
At the coliseum.

1723
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,250
Just fans brutally fighting.
It's happened all.

1724
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,750
All,
all the time.

1725
01:21:05,751 --> 01:21:07,410
I like any stadium,
just pick a stadium.

1726
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:08,720
Just going to be fights there basically.

1727
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,240
Oh my God,
this is crazy.

1728
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:13,120
This guy just dragged this guy that this
other guy was beaten up.

1729
01:21:13,121 --> 01:21:13,954
He dragged the guy over the top of the 
stairs and then he started beating him 

1730
01:21:16,031 --> 01:21:18,580
up.
Oh my God.

1731
01:21:18,581 --> 01:21:21,430
This is crazy.
This is insane.

1732
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,490
And there's no security.
Where the fuck is security?

1733
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:26,830
Well,
the preseason game with the rams,

1734
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,053
there was no this,
this happened and something else 

1735
01:21:29,381 --> 01:21:30,214
happened.
So I guess the rams didn't want to pay 

1736
01:21:31,841 --> 01:21:32,674
up and the city didn't want to pay up,
but I guess the rams ended up having to 

1737
01:21:35,981 --> 01:21:39,280
pay up the security at these games.
Now.

1738
01:21:39,281 --> 01:21:44,281
A raiders games particularly violent or 
is it all sports games?

1739
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,210
Well,
at this point,

1740
01:21:46,211 --> 01:21:47,044
who the fuck really knows?
There's a couple dodger games and then 

1741
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:50,973
not violent at all.
What about shit will philly in the old 

1742
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,713
days?
I don't know about this new stadium now 

1743
01:21:56,381 --> 01:21:57,214
with all the.
In the old days that was getting out of 

1744
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,380
the hell quick time.
Even at the fucking court downstairs.

1745
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,633
But uh,
over the last couple of years it's like 

1746
01:22:06,371 --> 01:22:07,204
they fucked people up.
You're just not getting into a push 

1747
01:22:08,861 --> 01:22:10,660
fight.
Two cops coming between you.

1748
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,900
It's like three guys beating up on it.
These fucking events.

1749
01:22:13,901 --> 01:22:16,840
You're going there with your children to
watch a football game.

1750
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:17,703
He hit.
Do you know a guy tried to two men get 

1751
01:22:19,991 --> 01:22:21,400
prison for dodgers stadium?

1752
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,673
Jesus Christ,
pretty sure after fight after baseball 

1753
01:22:25,211 --> 01:22:26,650
game.
Oh Man,

1754
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:30,460
God damn it.
Well this guy was the one that they,

1755
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:33,600
he had a blood clot and they couldn't 
find the killers.

1756
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:36,120
So they went to the tape.
I mean they narrowed it all the way down

1757
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:40,020
to the tickets for a stupid fucking 
game.

1758
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,183
Listen,
I could go to a game and have a good 

1759
01:22:42,151 --> 01:22:44,760
time and yell and scream and get three 
bids and all sudden like,

1760
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:47,040
oh yeah,
like the giants and the cowboys.

1761
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,090
Ah,
that's it.

1762
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,193
Yeah.
But now it's like people come up to you 

1763
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:51,404
and punch in the fucking head if you 
like somebody else or if you're walking 

1764
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,090
into the stadium that team lost and you 
have that shirt on.

1765
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:58,703
But if it's the certain.
Do certain teams have like a fan 

1766
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:03,060
mentality?
You know,

1767
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,050
like there's certain teams and other 
sports with like

1768
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,740
doesn't Manchester United?
Jamie knows something about soccer,

1769
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:10,390
right?
Don't they have like a certain,

1770
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:11,130
like rabid

1771
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:13,180
fan personality,
hooligans.

1772
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:14,103
This menu,
I think it's allowed each team over 

1773
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,180
there,
they all have their little sect,

1774
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,110
their club and they just kinda bought 
Brah.

1775
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,003
I don't know just what they do and not 
just in college football also at these 

1776
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:27,720
stadiums.
I never.

1777
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,490
They don't,
they just,

1778
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:31,830
just this year I think a lot of drinking
in some stadium.

1779
01:23:31,831 --> 01:23:34,500
The college it was up until maybe like a
year or two ago.

1780
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,590
You weren't even allowed.
I just went to a game at Ohio stadium.

1781
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,693
They should allow them to drink and 
you're only allowed to get like beer 

1782
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,000
maybe even so like there's no liquor but
that's just there.

1783
01:23:45,001 --> 01:23:47,220
I don't know how it is all over the 
tailgate and Joe Rogan.

1784
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,170
That's where the damage is done for 
sure.

1785
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:50,723
But don't allow them to keep the party 
rolling while they're up in the stands 

1786
01:23:52,531 --> 01:23:57,390
on your will stop after like half time 
in some places.

1787
01:23:57,391 --> 01:23:58,224
Years ago.
I know stadium stopped in the third 

1788
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:01,010
quarter.
Art,

1789
01:24:01,011 --> 01:24:01,280
our

1790
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,350
discussion this morning was about the 
building,

1791
01:24:03,351 --> 01:24:05,360
the stadium right across from the 
Mandalay Bay,

1792
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,390
like with the,
the thinking of building and I'm like,

1793
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:09,224
you know,
man,

1794
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,430
a fucking Sunday to get outta here now.
Let me ask you this.

1795
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,383
Is there a benefit to keeping like if 
they say if they bought a team that's 

1796
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:19,880
for sale,
like the raiders,

1797
01:24:19,881 --> 01:24:20,714
let's just say the raiders,
is there a benefit to keeping that name 

1798
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:26,480
or is there a benefit to stardom?
It's going to be in Las Vegas.

1799
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:29,780
Benefit to changing the name will.
They're going to call them the Las Vegas

1800
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:30,614
raiders,
but because of what people call it with 

1801
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:36,050
a Brendan,
it's the raiders.

1802
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:36,893
They're going to keep the radios and 
they'll keep the black and silver and 

1803
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:40,610
the whole.
I mean wide changes.

1804
01:24:40,611 --> 01:24:41,444
The whole mentality now they're in 
fucking right now where they were in 

1805
01:24:43,251 --> 01:24:44,620
Vegas.
That's so crazy.

1806
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:46,570
They're going to be in Vegas and this is
their stadium.

1807
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,670
Las Vegas Committee Sends Raiders 
Stadium Plan to Governor.

1808
01:24:49,671 --> 01:24:52,430
It looks insane.
I'll tell you what,

1809
01:24:52,431 --> 01:24:54,530
man,
I've never been to a live football game.

1810
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,680
Not a big ass crazy nfl game,
but I could only imagine.

1811
01:24:57,681 --> 01:25:02,480
The energy must be insane.
It must be insane when you get a 100,000

1812
01:25:02,481 --> 01:25:04,160
people screaming at the top of their 
lungs.

1813
01:25:04,161 --> 01:25:07,160
When some shit goes down,
it makes you wonder,

1814
01:25:07,161 --> 01:25:07,994
man,
what it would have been like to see the 

1815
01:25:10,461 --> 01:25:11,294
colosseum in Rome.
I mean imagine what that must have been 

1816
01:25:14,211 --> 01:25:16,760
like.
And with real blood,

1817
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,220
real blood's got chopped swords and 
shit.

1818
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:24,450
Russell Crowe strapping motherfuckers.
It's like that is the same.

1819
01:25:24,451 --> 01:25:28,160
We will looking at it essentially it's 
the same progression from like Pete rose

1820
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:30,250
to today's baseball,
you know,

1821
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:34,070
versus like gladiators to like some 
crazy football game.

1822
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,620
It's like it's just,
there's just,

1823
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:40,670
there's no way we want to slide back 
that sword fighting shit again.

1824
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:45,030
If that would be the one thing like 
yeah,

1825
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:45,873
you can't do that.
One thing I noticed the last couple of 

1826
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:48,613
weeks because you know,
during the year I don't really sit and 

1827
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:50,843
watch baseball.
It's around the world series that I'll 

1828
01:25:52,191 --> 01:25:53,930
watch a game.
So the other thing,

1829
01:25:53,931 --> 01:25:56,240
the green room,
we're watching it now,

1830
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:59,960
they even have like Joel pieces,
jaw piece,

1831
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,073
tons of protection now like.
So if you're batter of you get hit with 

1832
01:26:04,221 --> 01:26:04,881
a ball.
Yes.

1833
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:07,240
So if you're a battery or a right handed
batter,

1834
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:09,980
your,
your helmet now comes down to here.

1835
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,800
So all you could see as the ball.
Oh,

1836
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:14,040
that's weird.
So if the blue.

1837
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:14,903
Yeah,
some of these jaw got broken or 

1838
01:26:15,901 --> 01:26:16,734
something like that.
They're looking to protect your pete 

1839
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:21,470
rose's game.
He was a fucking gladiator.

1840
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,560
But when I was a kid,
I remember that's when that guy,

1841
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,630
Tony Conigliaro,
is that his name,

1842
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,540
the guy who got hit with a ball.

1843
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:30,703
Who's the guy that got hit with a ball?
He was a big player in the Boston Red 

1844
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:35,803
Sox.
You got hit with a ball and was never 

1845
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:40,760
the same again.
And Sam wasn't a fucking.

1846
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,850
I was a baseball fan until I started 
martial arts,

1847
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:48,470
so till I was like 14 or 15 and uh,
I forget the story,

1848
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:49,700
but I remember thinking,
man,

1849
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:52,210
I did not know a baseball could fuck you
up that bad.

1850
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,400
This guy was essentially net Tony 
Conigliaro.

1851
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:56,061
Yeah,
that's it.

1852
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:59,960
So he got hit with his baseball and he 
was just never the same again.

1853
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:04,961
And he was a star player before he got 
hit and sort of never recovered.

1854
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,740
Was All fucked up afterwards.
But that,

1855
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:11,990
um,
I don't remember when he died,

1856
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:15,330
but I believe he died young,
90 an hour,

1857
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:19,010
80 year,
state even faster.

1858
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,540
I mean,
some guys like Roger Clemens.

1859
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:24,590
What would you throw in his prime in the
800?

1860
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:26,270
You know,
this was the seventies,

1861
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:27,020
right?
Yeah.

1862
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:29,450
So the eighties,
they still weren't the,

1863
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,980
you know,
it was still growing.

1864
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:31,843
Ada.
I mean the technology might have been a 

1865
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:34,310
little wrong,
you know,

1866
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,450
steroids,
they weren't a lot of steroids.

1867
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:39,140
So many.
So you have to just still.

1868
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,400
Yeah,
still.

1869
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:42,110
Yeah.
You had to.

1870
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:43,400
Um,
what were you going to say,

1871
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:44,220
Jamie?

1872
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,860
The guy closes for the cubs that pitches
last night.

1873
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,080
Chapman,
he's throwing 102 miles an hour.

1874
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:53,830
Fast balls on Sunday.
That was fast.

1875
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:59,470
It breaks bats and shit.
And that's so fast.

1876
01:28:01,390 --> 01:28:04,050
That hits your kneecap at that one.
It just shattered it.

1877
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:05,760
Let's chat.
Is it

1878
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,560
crazy ability,
you know,

1879
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,433
I mean,
you have ability to take a baseball bat 

1880
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:14,850
and base our baseball rather and just 
basically held something in the head.

1881
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:15,893
You could throw it like that guy.
I could throw a baseball at a dog and 

1882
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:20,023
Kol,
like if you want it to that kind of 

1883
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:26,910
accuracy and speed,
you know,

1884
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:27,744
they think that might've been one of the
reasons why human beings evolved like 

1885
01:28:30,421 --> 01:28:31,530
that.
Our brains evolved.

1886
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,633
That was one of the considerations.
So they're trying to figure out which 

1887
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:35,523
what causes the brain to double.
Our brain doubled over a period of 2 

1888
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,561
million years.
Apparently it's,

1889
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,460
it's just giant mystery.
They don't know why.

1890
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:43,560
There's a bunch of thoughts as to why 
did it.

1891
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:46,860
People started eating more meat,
started cooking their meat.

1892
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:49,110
They get get them more access to 
nutrients,

1893
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:50,063
but another weird one is they think it 
might've had something to do with the 

1894
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:53,124
throwing arm.
Then when people figured out that they 

1895
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:56,154
could pick stuff up and throw it at 
something that they started getting 

1896
01:28:58,711 --> 01:29:01,410
clever and that's when they started 
devising

1897
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,813
solutions to problems and it gave them 
more access to food because they could 

1898
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:06,294
kill animals better.
So they were throwing rocks like 

1899
01:29:07,981 --> 01:29:08,814
squirrels and shit and eating them.
So what you mean to tell me it's on its 

1900
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:12,234
own.
Our brain has doubled in size over a 

1901
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:17,790
period of 2 million years.
The human brain doubled,

1902
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:21,510
was a long met.
None of that was a long time ago.

1903
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:23,490
Oh yeah.
But there's more information.

1904
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:24,803
There was no books back then.
There was during the time that human 

1905
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:29,760
brain doubled.
We were basically going from these,

1906
01:29:29,761 --> 01:29:30,920
uh,
you know,

1907
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:34,830
more primitive hominids to becoming a 
human being.

1908
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:39,831
And then there was a sort of a period 
where things move along at a fairly slow

1909
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:40,824
pace,
but then all of a sudden something 

1910
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:44,130
explodes over what seems like a long 
time,

1911
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,610
but 2 million years is not that long in 
evolutionary terms.

1912
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:48,803
So something happened when we were some 
sort of monkey creature and during that 

1913
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:56,700
time there was a change where we mutated
in our brain,

1914
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:59,700
doubled in size and we became way more 
sophisticated.

1915
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,103
No Fun.
The Fun Shit is to think that that was 

1916
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:03,744
aliens.
The Fun Shit is to think that aliens 

1917
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:08,040
came down and uh,
you know,

1918
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:10,890
put sperm and a monkey or did some tests
with,

1919
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:13,560
you know,
took one of the early primates and added

1920
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:14,394
alien DNA to it and dropped it back off.
And that's why the brain got so big so 

1921
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:19,170
quick.
But it's,

1922
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,610
we've figured some shit out,
man.

1923
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:22,080
And the people that didn't figure it 
out,

1924
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:23,520
they didn't live,
you know,

1925
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:27,780
we probably figured out high spaces keep
you away from cats,

1926
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,653
got to climb up high.
You got to figure out how to invent 

1927
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:33,360
weapons.
You gotta like soft.

1928
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:34,680
Like we,
we didn't.

1929
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:36,030
Uh,
we didn't get the fangs.

1930
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:37,043
We didn't get the claws,
but we've got the crazy brain and we 

1931
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:40,224
went to crazy brain option over 2 
million years somehow or another for 

1932
01:30:42,811 --> 01:30:43,860
whatever reason it grew.

1933
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:45,743
It's pretty nuts when you think about it
because every other animal on this 

1934
01:30:47,941 --> 01:30:48,774
fucking planet is basically like.
There's some advanced animals like 

1935
01:30:53,251 --> 01:30:57,300
chimps and dolphins and some other 
advanced animals,

1936
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:58,890
you know,
that we think are real smart,

1937
01:30:58,891 --> 01:31:02,400
like octopus when we're not exactly sure
how their little brains work.

1938
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:06,690
But when it comes to doing the kind of 
shit that we can do to the planet,

1939
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:11,340
which we fly,
we changed the temperature of buildings.

1940
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,130
We project video,
you know,

1941
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:16,620
we,
we can film things in real time and then

1942
01:31:16,621 --> 01:31:17,454
show them seconds later on this little 
tiny thing that slips right into your 

1943
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:23,010
pocket.
I mean we're,

1944
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:23,873
we're on some weird complete different 
level than everything that exists in 

1945
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:33,240
terms of if maybe not far,
not our actual overall intelligence,

1946
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:36,960
our ability to change our environment.
It changed space around us.

1947
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,610
There's nothing like us,
man.

1948
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:44,060
That's who knows what the fuck cause 
that they don't know.

1949
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,810
Transplant candidate thinks it's 
mushrooms,

1950
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:51,030
so he thinks,
thinks there's a,

1951
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:54,220
it's called the stoned ape theory.
He thinks he's ancient monkeys,

1952
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,240
found some mushrooms,
atum and then,

1953
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:59,650
well blah blah blah,
blah,

1954
01:31:59,651 --> 01:31:59,951
blah,
blah,

1955
01:31:59,951 --> 01:32:00,370
blah,
blah,

1956
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,203
blah.

1957
01:32:01,370 --> 01:32:04,710
Got In tune with the mother.
Joined Diaz sometimes to kind,

1958
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,840
kinda leave me the fuck alone.
He's dead.

1959
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:08,760
Who gives a fuck?
He's dead.

1960
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,400
Fuck.
I'm talking about 2007 thing if one,

1961
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:12,930
lesson chimp with acid.
Anyway,

1962
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,660
we're talking about doubling of the 
human brain.

1963
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:17,100
How the fuck did we even get onto that?
Who the fuck knows?

1964
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:19,440
He just came out of it.
I'm dealing with these sprays and shit.

1965
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:25,850
You can't scare me like this shit on a 
fucking doing a 50 milligram Brownie and

1966
01:32:27,211 --> 01:32:30,700
you've got to hit me with these stories 
about the human brain pictures.

1967
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:32,760
That's TMZ.
That's what happened.

1968
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:37,560
People want to listen to TMZ and they 
need fucking more a space.

1969
01:32:37,561 --> 01:32:40,500
Like when you got your computer after a 
month you realize what the fuck?

1970
01:32:40,501 --> 01:32:42,030
I need more space.
I got born,

1971
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,070
I got a UFC,
I got,

1972
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,480
you know,
the family,

1973
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:47,610
you know,
we run on a hard drive space.

1974
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,640
We need space.
It's very important for ourselves,

1975
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:52,260
you know,
will get stronger.

1976
01:32:52,261 --> 01:32:56,250
We'll get fucking bigger.
Look at these kids in football now.

1977
01:32:56,251 --> 01:32:57,820
They're fucking huge.
These kids that,

1978
01:32:57,830 --> 01:32:59,250
these animals,
these kids.

1979
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:00,510
Yeah.
How,

1980
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,433
when we're talking about the difference 
in baseball pitchers quit baseball 

1981
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:08,880
players back then were throwing what was
like a super fast Nolan Ryan,

1982
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:09,743
Nolan,
probably the fucking throwing to eat 

1983
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:14,370
since day one.
That fucking guy.

1984
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:16,180
And uh,
how fast did he throw?

1985
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:17,014
Like it'd be 90,
but you figure you take a guy that 

1986
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:24,150
pitches 85 were good control.
Okay,

1987
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:24,984
well I'm talking about gun control is I 
can hit any other nine Elvis's every 

1988
01:33:28,201 --> 01:33:31,860
time I pitch right from how far away is 
like 60 slash 60 feet?

1989
01:33:31,861 --> 01:33:33,930
60 point six inches.
Okay.

1990
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,190
So you take one of those guys don't 
through what we have today.

1991
01:33:38,191 --> 01:33:39,450
You know,
you put them with.

1992
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:44,160
What's the guy that we would think 
really highly of Marinovich yeah.

1993
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:45,120
Marble intervention.
Okay.

1994
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:45,954
You put them with like,
I'm a really rich guy that strengthen 

1995
01:33:47,161 --> 01:33:51,720
those fucking all those muscles that 
they haven't figured out before.

1996
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,690
You know that,
that that's quick.

1997
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:56,400
You know,
how long do those guys last?

1998
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,400
Jamie?
Few years.

1999
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,920
But Nolan Ryan,
he lasted a long ass time.

2000
01:34:01,921 --> 01:34:02,754
Yeah,
but they had to take the surgeries and 

2001
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:09,170
the surgeries to have that type of,
you know,

2002
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,130
because it's not just your arm.
Okay,

2003
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,420
let's pull.
It's not yours.

2004
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,060
It starts when you picked that fucking 
leg up.

2005
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:19,920
When you pick that leg up,
the energy of that leg on your own time,

2006
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:21,720
not the next time you smoke a joint.
Late night,

2007
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:22,573
you know,
insomnia,

2008
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,863
just and put up the 10 best pitches and 
look what that front leg does and how 

2009
01:34:27,721 --> 01:34:29,850
that front leg also controls that time.

2010
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,493
There's a pitcher now that pitches for 
Chicago that you switched sitting there 

2011
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:36,510
and you're waiting for the ball.
The foxy door.

2012
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,740
What the fuck?
They already have flopped because it's a

2013
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,140
fuckin angle.
It still leg.

2014
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,100
He pops it out.
He drops the ball.

2015
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,270
It's that whole body technology in 
there.

2016
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,113
So there's a guy,
there's a fucking dude with glasses and 

2017
01:34:53,821 --> 01:34:54,654
Iowa right now.
I got the training for this right or 

2018
01:34:58,731 --> 01:34:59,564
wrong,
you know the major league right now 

2019
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,830
doesn't give a fuck about strengthening 
your arm and all that.

2020
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:07,360
How can we take my guy from 98 to one?
Oh,

2021
01:35:07,361 --> 01:35:11,210
four.
And have them be able to throw at one.

2022
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:12,800
Oh,
4:20

2023
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:14,810
pictures the most.
Hm.

2024
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:18,260
And I'll just put them in every three 
games to just kill motherfuckers.

2025
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:19,903
Do you understand me in the seventh 
inning when you're getting momentum in 

2026
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:22,754
comes this guy that throws one on fourth
and he's going to throw it's nine 

2027
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:29,330
pitches.

2028
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,810
He's going to throw 12 pitches and 
you're out of there.

2029
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:35,660
I really don't because remember,
the faster the ball comes in,

2030
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:38,510
the faster the ball goes out.
Always remember that too.

2031
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,700
If you live by the sword,
you die by that motherfucking sort of.

2032
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,573
Somebody hits a home run.
It's because he popped the 98 

2033
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:50,750
motherfucker that made a mistake and put
it in who?

2034
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,250
Loeb and his gorilla,
because that's all it determined.

2035
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:56,060
It's just A.
It's like a game of inches.

2036
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,223
He just dropped it.
It just dropped a little bit too much 

2037
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:03,140
for one of these fucking things.
Now on the other side,

2038
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:08,350
you got to Marinovich that comes in and 
takes that guy that batch to 90,

2039
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,513
keeps them healthy,
give some conditioning stuff out of the 

2040
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:14,870
shoulder.
What's the recovery?

2041
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:17,870
Because the recovery in that game is the
whole game,

2042
01:36:17,871 --> 01:36:18,704
Joe,
right?

2043
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:21,830
The recovery is the whole thing and this
fucking along those guys.

2044
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:25,430
Two or three years later,
that's too much on that.

2045
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,353
All those 10 meets the surgery.
Will the shoulders alone muscles 

2046
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:33,730
combined and to throw that particular 
look how many muscles I have involved,

2047
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:34,783
especially if it come look at this,
try this on your own and I had no 

2048
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:38,414
flexibility.
It's got to go at least all the way the 

2049
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:46,490
fuck back this and as that leg drops,
look what that arm it has to come in.

2050
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,620
Perfect.
Perfect.

2051
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,113
Over the top and then down across and 
now the follow through is the most 

2052
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:54,614
important.
Yeah,

2053
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:55,633
it's got to come.
And that's a thing for if you throw a 

2054
01:36:57,951 --> 01:36:58,784
ball like a girl,
and I don't mean like a girl knows how 

2055
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:02,480
to throw a ball,
but you know what I'm talking about.

2056
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:05,870
If you throw a ball and spastic like as 
Steven Seagal.

2057
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,880
Yeah,
people will never respect you.

2058
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:12,650
It's a real issue like you,
you could suck it a lot of stuff.

2059
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:14,600
You could suck at basketball.
How about this?

2060
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:18,950
You could suck at like throwing a free t
three a free throw and people laugh.

2061
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:23,810
Ha ha ha ha.
But if you throw the first pitch and you

2062
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:26,720
throw that like some uncoordinated 
spazz,

2063
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:27,763
if you hit this fucking first pitch,
dark it off the ground like you're a 

2064
01:37:31,401 --> 01:37:32,840
loser.
Like there's a.

2065
01:37:32,841 --> 01:37:35,900
there's a harshness like people get.
It's like some school yard shit

2066
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:39,660
you just said free throat.
You reminded me of something I saw.

2067
01:37:39,661 --> 01:37:41,160
I haven't heard anybody bring this up 
yet.

2068
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:44,580
Someone made stevie wonder shoot a free 
throw and they have it on video.

2069
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,680
Did he nail it?
No.

2070
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:47,580
He missed it.
Well obviously terribly,

2071
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:51,420
but I don't know how this movie and you 
don't want to let him know he missed it.

2072
01:37:51,421 --> 01:37:53,940
They could have all just played along 
and made it.

2073
01:37:53,941 --> 01:37:55,980
Someone should have caught it.
The other said dropped a ball

2074
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,813
right through the net.

2075
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:04,040
They given another shot.
It's just says it over and over again.

2076
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:04,874
But Oh,
why don't they just let him figure it 

2077
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:08,600
out where it is.
If he keeps throwing it,

2078
01:38:08,601 --> 01:38:10,880
how long do you think it would take 
before we figured out where it is?

2079
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:13,960
A long he wouldn't even know how to 
install it.

2080
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:16,450
That's terrible that they even did this 
as well.

2081
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,670
If there was no one in the room and you 
could get,

2082
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:22,730
let him use like echolocation what he 
yelled out.

2083
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:25,340
Hello with this beautiful voice.
Hello.

2084
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:26,760
Maybe you could figure out,
you know,

2085
01:38:26,761 --> 01:38:27,594
because deaf guys apparently are blind 
guys rather apparently can do that to a 

2086
01:38:30,681 --> 01:38:33,650
certain extent.
Like they hear sound bounce off things,

2087
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:34,970
you know,
how far away things are.

2088
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:36,763
But how would he know where the net is 
if you put my waist right in front of 

2089
01:38:40,731 --> 01:38:41,240
it?
If you go.

2090
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,150
The thing is 15 feet.
Right?

2091
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:44,840
Exactly.
From us right now.

2092
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:45,674
Stevie,
I'll be under them that you just keep 

2093
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:49,100
going into your head.
You fucking hit it.

2094
01:38:49,101 --> 01:38:49,934
Success.
What's the concept of 15 feet to a guy 

2095
01:38:52,671 --> 01:38:54,120
who was blind,
you know?

2096
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:56,930
Do you think he lost 10 feet in the air?
Right?

2097
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,120
Ten feet in the air?
Yeah,

2098
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,470
that's A.
Yeah,

2099
01:39:00,471 --> 01:39:01,304
I was going to figure that out.
I just never thrown anything before 

2100
01:39:03,351 --> 01:39:05,840
either.
But that's not embarrassing.

2101
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:08,310
I mean,
especially at Stevie wonder's blind.

2102
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:09,223
But if even if it was a regular guy that
sucked at basketball and through a free 

2103
01:39:12,051 --> 01:39:13,040
throw,
it would be funny.

2104
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,420
Be Stupid.
But funny,

2105
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:17,420
but if you fucking missed that first 
pitch,

2106
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:19,610
if they ask you,
hey joey,

2107
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:20,623
I hear you're going to be in town,
you want to throw out the first pitch 

2108
01:39:22,101 --> 01:39:23,660
for the game.
They're like,

2109
01:39:23,661 --> 01:39:24,211
ah,
yeah,

2110
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:24,810
yeah,
yeah.

2111
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:26,630
I used to play a lot of baseball when I 
was a kid.

2112
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:29,060
I'll fucking do that.
You go out there.

2113
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:32,170
I'll full of piss and vinegar.
You want.

2114
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:34,270
I wouldn't even.
I wouldn't make 60 feet.

2115
01:39:34,271 --> 01:39:35,810
Right?
There is no way.

2116
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:36,943
Oh yeah.
Gary Dell bought day from the stern 

2117
01:39:38,151 --> 01:39:38,721
show.
Here.

2118
01:39:38,721 --> 01:39:39,870
He goes,
no way.

2119
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:42,920
I would make 60 feet right here it goes.
Let's see what he does.

2120
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:43,903
Oh,
they're good.

2121
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:45,800
They're all talking about it.
Like it's an event.

2122
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,040
Maybe one of the worst ones ever.
Here it is.

2123
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:49,471
Yeah,
yeah,

2124
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:53,090
yeah.
He throws it and they don't show you.

2125
01:39:53,091 --> 01:39:56,210
They actually hear it goes throw it.
Oh my God.

2126
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:58,010
It didn't go anywhere near him.

2127
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:02,883
Yeah.
He completely missed to make it any 

2128
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:06,123
worse than it is though,
because it went all the way to the 

2129
01:40:07,211 --> 01:40:09,050
catcher.
Right?

2130
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

2131
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:18,360
You should get made fun of him for sure.
They'd been making fun of him.

2132
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,080
That's why there's a whole piece about 
this,

2133
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:21,213
but do you think.
You said this is what happens when you 

2134
01:40:23,081 --> 01:40:25,250
get made fun of this is what happens 
when you throw like that.

2135
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:27,311
Oh,
for sure.

2136
01:40:27,311 --> 01:40:28,260
You get made fun of.
Yeah.

2137
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:32,080
Yeah.
I thought you were saying that he missed

2138
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,183
because he gets made fun of like they've
destroyed his confidence to the point 

2139
01:40:35,621 --> 01:40:38,440
where you can't throw a baseball.
I get it.

2140
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:42,130
It's a good point though.
There's something about throwing.

2141
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:42,551
Oh,
see,

2142
01:40:42,551 --> 01:40:44,800
they have the worst first pitches ever.
Yeah.

2143
01:40:44,801 --> 01:40:46,960
Ip in that.
I'd be in that for sure.

2144
01:40:46,961 --> 01:40:47,794
I can't really throw the ball.
I tried Puma football a couple months 

2145
01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:51,730
ago.
Reference.

2146
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:52,680
Horrific.
Really?

2147
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,770
Football.
It's gone.

2148
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:54,160
Oh,

2149
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:54,993
this guy's had in my shoulders is gone.
I'm living on fucking smoke and my 

2150
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:01,480
shoulders.
There's nothing in there.

2151
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,680
I don't know how they're not hurting me.
There's nothing in there.

2152
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:08,140
I don't think so.
Did you get an Mri?

2153
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:12,520
What?
I'm going to waste their fucking time.

2154
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:15,010
What can you not do with it?
Can you put your arms over your head?

2155
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:16,140
Flexibility.
You know,

2156
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:19,950
my flexibility is halfway there.
I can't do flies anymore.

2157
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,820
That type of shit.
You know,

2158
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:26,821
the thing that helps me a lot now is the
bat the way that bats are great.

2159
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,873
You know,
why aren't you taking that guy's a 

2160
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,880
kettlebell classes at,
uh,

2161
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,590
the Jujitsu school.
You go to Joe,

2162
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:34,480
Joe,
Joe Alvarado.

2163
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:35,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

2164
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,450
I've been told is a kettle Jujitsu,
Jujitsu.

2165
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:40,240
Bad Ass man.
I've seen his instagram video,

2166
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:40,840
right?
Dude,

2167
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,460
man.
I went in there the other day and I want

2168
01:41:43,461 --> 01:41:44,320
in there a little early.

2169
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,540
They have class at 12 and it wasn't 
doing anything.

2170
01:41:46,541 --> 01:41:47,374
I want to net 11.
There's usually some guys when I was 

2171
01:41:49,391 --> 01:41:52,460
messing around with some guy and my 
professor Alvarado is,

2172
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,700
let me teach you something joey,
that's perfect for you.

2173
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:55,953
And he stayed with me for 30 minutes and
we just worked this half guard sweep 

2174
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:01,630
that was just tremendous.
Joe Rogan.

2175
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:04,060
Simple shit for a fat dude.
You know what I'm saying?

2176
01:42:04,061 --> 01:42:05,050
Like,
uh,

2177
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:06,003
they teach that old manage it,
so it's just less movement and get the 

2178
01:42:09,701 --> 01:42:11,950
job done effectively.
He's a great dude,

2179
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:14,160
but he,
we worked in off of a.

2180
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:15,310
At first he goes,
Joe,

2181
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:16,163
you're gonna have a problem with this.
Let's get a Kettlebell and working off 

2182
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:22,330
of a Turkish got.
It'll be a lot easier for you to develop

2183
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:23,680
the movement.
There was basically,

2184
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,420
boom,
get the under hook,

2185
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,580
grab the arm and just flip over that.

2186
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,240
But he turns it very,
uh,

2187
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,560
he's a good man.
So when you do Turkish getups,

2188
01:42:32,561 --> 01:42:33,394
it doesn't bother your shoulder.
I could do a Turkish get up to the 

2189
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:37,080
point.
Like for,

2190
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:38,680
I can't lie.
I can't do point.

2191
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:43,630
You can't get to the fifth part.
Boom here to the top.

2192
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,830
Okay.
So you don't ever stand up all the way?

2193
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:48,281
No,
no,

2194
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:48,791
no.
Okay.

2195
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:52,150
So you just hip up and you have the from
my hip.

2196
01:42:52,151 --> 01:42:53,980
I do more my hands to be honest with 
you.

2197
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:56,200
The shoulder,
like I said,

2198
01:42:56,201 --> 01:42:58,690
that little weighted bat is tremendous,
but it.

2199
01:42:58,691 --> 01:42:59,740
Let me ask you this.
Is it.

2200
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:00,643
I'm the reason why you don't get up.
Is it because of the weight or your 

2201
01:43:02,891 --> 01:43:04,720
shoulders?
It's my weight and the weight.

2202
01:43:04,721 --> 01:43:06,490
It's the weight on the shoulders 
combined.

2203
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:07,010
Well,
you know what,

2204
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:07,970
you can do the model.
No,

2205
01:43:07,971 --> 01:43:08,200
no,
no.

2206
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,320
I can do the leg thing and go from 
there.

2207
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:11,710
No,
no,

2208
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:15,980
I'm good that that's one thing,
but what I'm saying is with the,

2209
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:19,570
especially with the Turkish get up,
like people underestimate the benefit of

2210
01:43:19,571 --> 01:43:20,404
doing it with even know.
Wait like you just doing it as a 

2211
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:24,340
posture.
Just lying on your back,

2212
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,070
straighten your arm up and going through
all the motions,

2213
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:28,900
propping up on your elbow,
you know,

2214
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:30,490
going up on the hip,
you know,

2215
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:32,500
hoisting your hip hop lyft net,
one leg,

2216
01:43:32,501 --> 01:43:33,334
getting an underneath you,
standing up straight and then fully 

2217
01:43:36,071 --> 01:43:37,600
standing straight with your arm 
extended.

2218
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:41,710
If you just go through that series of 
motions have been carrying a Kettlebell.

2219
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,780
That's an professor.
Alvarado is Walmart.

2220
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:44,950
He does that with no.
No,

2221
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:45,813
no Kettlebell.
No.

2222
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,370
That's good.
Just that as a warmup.

2223
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:52,010
I mean people don't it if you don't

2224
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:55,640
move your body around a lot like that,
it's hard to move your body around like,

2225
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:57,800
you know what I started doing recently 
that I haven't done it forever.

2226
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,590
Jumping rope.
I started jumping.

2227
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:03,380
I fucking love it.
It's hard to.

2228
01:44:03,381 --> 01:44:04,810
Yeah,
it's hard to.

2229
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:05,723
Minutes is 20 minutes of jogging to.
It's hard to do three minutes like 

2230
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:14,210
around like in between like a set,
the boxing timer and I do three minutes.

2231
01:44:14,211 --> 01:44:15,690
It's fucking hard.
It's hard.

2232
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,433
You're like this shit.
He feel pretty good and then about 30 

2233
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:21,710
seconds and you're like,
oh,

2234
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:26,850
I gotta fucking concentrated here.
I've got to make this.

2235
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,830
I'm feeling it in my feet started 
hurting.

2236
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:29,361
I'm like,
oh,

2237
01:44:29,361 --> 01:44:31,250
this is one of those things.
If you don't do it,

2238
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,870
you think it's easy and then once you do
it,

2239
01:44:32,871 --> 01:44:34,700
you realize are you going to get in 
shape for this too?

2240
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:35,570
Like everything else.

2241
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,200
Your body's not used to jumping around 
like that point and going,

2242
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:38,680
going,
going,

2243
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:39,131
going,
going,

2244
01:44:39,131 --> 01:44:39,611
going,
going,

2245
01:44:39,611 --> 01:44:40,251
going,
going,

2246
01:44:40,251 --> 01:44:40,701
going,
going,

2247
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:42,710
don't do anything.
But if you can do it,

2248
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:44,053
I would imagine there'll be tremendous 
for your footwork and you free your 

2249
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:49,520
agility and your foot strength and all 
the strength in,

2250
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,400
in all those connecting ligaments 
because essentially what you're doing is

2251
01:44:52,401 --> 01:44:54,940
little tiny plyometrics.
You know,

2252
01:44:54,941 --> 01:44:56,330
you're jumping,
you're not,

2253
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:59,210
you're not getting full extended 
explosion movements,

2254
01:44:59,211 --> 01:45:02,120
but you're getting these little jumping 
bounces where you know,

2255
01:45:02,121 --> 01:45:03,170
you're,
you're with me.

2256
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:06,780
I'm 196 or something like that and 196 
pounds going,

2257
01:45:06,781 --> 01:45:07,361
going,
going,

2258
01:45:07,361 --> 01:45:08,510
going,
going on my feet.

2259
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,580
That's great for you.
You know,

2260
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,713
it develops real strength in your feet.
I got sore in weird places for like 

2261
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:19,240
three weeks when I first started putting
to rankle yeah,

2262
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:21,890
my ankle.
My calves got super tight,

2263
01:45:21,891 --> 01:45:22,724
like it was really fucking up my 
kickboxing because I would try to kick 

2264
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:28,700
and I'd be worried that like my calf was
going to lock up.

2265
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:31,610
Like it was real sore,
like a in a,

2266
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:32,470
in a way that,
uh,

2267
01:45:32,471 --> 01:45:36,350
I thought I was hitting with those Hindu
squats and I like to do.

2268
01:45:36,351 --> 01:45:38,120
I think I thought that was hitting my 
calves and up.

2269
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,013
I guess not.
There's no substitution for that little 

2270
01:45:40,971 --> 01:45:43,970
bouncing.
You know where I got it from him,

2271
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:45,643
Lance Armstrong's podcast.
I was listening to Lance Armstrong's 

2272
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:51,950
podcast and he was talking about his son
being friends with.

2273
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:56,450
He's friends with Brett farve and Brett 
farve came to his house in the son plays

2274
01:45:56,451 --> 01:45:57,620
football,
so he asked his son,

2275
01:45:57,621 --> 01:45:58,454
he goes,
Hey,

2276
01:45:58,490 --> 01:46:00,830
do you skip rope?
Like this is the first thing he asked,

2277
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:05,480
and he had talked to some other guy who 
was also some big time football player,

2278
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,370
big time football coach rather,
and he's like,

2279
01:46:07,371 --> 01:46:09,500
do skip rope and the kids.
And he said,

2280
01:46:09,501 --> 01:46:10,334
no.
So you got to skip rope and the same 

2281
01:46:11,781 --> 01:46:13,580
thing Brett Farve said you got to skip 
rope.

2282
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,653
Like there's something about jumping 
rope that for like footwork and 

2283
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:19,040
movement.
And so I said,

2284
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:19,874
all right,
I'm going to start doing that and right 

2285
01:46:20,931 --> 01:46:21,764
away I realized like God damn it,
how come I haven't been doing this 

2286
01:46:23,841 --> 01:46:25,790
forever?
I should have been doing this forever.

2287
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,073
Open everything.
I got one of those everlast while my 

2288
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:30,314
daughter go and do a layer on top ones 
and she left it out there one day and I 

2289
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:34,670
go,
let me try this old school.

2290
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:38,960
I do like 32 seconds at those.
Did you rip your feet apart?

2291
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:39,913
No.
That's one thing that I got those cube 

2292
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:46,570
does it have for going feet.
That'll fuck around Jack.

2293
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:50,010
This was coming up when I was a kid.
Everybody

2294
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,843
you talked to tell you how to jump rope.
I used to jump rope at night with no 

2295
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:54,174
weights.
Basketball workout was 20 slash 30 

2296
01:46:56,881 --> 01:46:58,980
minutes of jumping rope and then I would
sit on the wall,

2297
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:02,340
just sit to condition my thighs.
Twenty,

2298
01:47:02,341 --> 01:47:03,510
30 minutes.
That was it.

2299
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,160
Yeah.
That wall sit thing.

2300
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:08,730
That was always big.
And Karate schools was a big wolf.

2301
01:47:08,731 --> 01:47:11,820
Say the spine to the wall.
Had a wall looking straight ahead.

2302
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,260
If you could do it,
you know,

2303
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:15,030
you a little.
But then they did horses.

2304
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:16,793
Horses in class.
Always motherfuckers that would sit 

2305
01:47:19,531 --> 01:47:21,290
there and go 20 minutes.
What?

2306
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:26,160
I think it's probably better to run 
stairs.

2307
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,680
I'm uh,
I'm on the run stairs.

2308
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:33,090
Are you really running them to know I 
have hills near my house,

2309
01:47:33,091 --> 01:47:34,530
you know,
hills near my house.

2310
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:39,000
I do some sprints up those on occasion.
Fairly rare.

2311
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:40,103
But um,
the thing that I like about that though 

2312
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,960
is that it's like you're exploding your 
body forward.

2313
01:47:45,961 --> 01:47:50,190
I think like that static hold of like a,
there's benefits to that for sure,

2314
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,770
but I just don't think he can fuck with 
plyometrics.

2315
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:53,803
Essentially what you're running a hill,
you're essentially dealing like one 

2316
01:47:55,561 --> 01:47:58,140
legged plyometrics.
You're just exploding,

2317
01:47:58,141 --> 01:48:00,900
exploding,
exploding for the workout that you do.

2318
01:48:00,901 --> 01:48:01,734
When the Diet you do,
they say that you have to recommend 

2319
01:48:03,451 --> 01:48:06,510
running once a week.
Sprints that primal diet,

2320
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:10,110
they say absolutely like 10:40
yard sprints.

2321
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:11,870
It's good for you.
I'm a 40 year,

2322
01:48:11,871 --> 01:48:14,550
I believe.
I just need a heart attack at this point

2323
01:48:14,551 --> 01:48:15,270
in my life.

2324
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:17,300
For Awhile I was going crazy when I 
couldn't find that.

2325
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,230
Figuring out the cardio.
Why wasn't breathing?

2326
01:48:19,231 --> 01:48:21,240
I would go into that fucking north 
Hollywood park,

2327
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:24,880
walk around with a farm.
It was kettle bell and then I would like

2328
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:25,763
do 10 sets of swings and they'll go let 
me try some fucking sprints and that 

2329
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:30,520
would do it.
Not realizing like,

2330
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,373
what the fuck am I doing?
I could pull something here that can 

2331
01:48:34,561 --> 01:48:37,260
then retain.
This isn't just a fucking,

2332
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:38,300
you know,
like you know,

2333
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,710
you're not warmed up properly for that 
shit.

2334
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:41,603
Right.
I remember going to track as a kid 

2335
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:43,884
because they tried to tell me during the
off season basketball players with a 

2336
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,833
high jump to stay in shape and we had 
this guy real wolf and I read wolf was 

2337
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:53,580
the one of the assistants at the fucking
Olympics.

2338
01:48:53,581 --> 01:48:56,400
Great Guy and you know he was at the 
bend squats.

2339
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:00,180
That was this big fucking squats to get 
the fuck.

2340
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:01,023
Yeah.
I'll go down on the squad and popping 

2341
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:06,880
into jumping rope and those fucking 
spreads.

2342
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:09,710
And we used to run hills in north Bergen
because it's the second hill.

2343
01:49:09,711 --> 01:49:11,820
He is fucking,
you know,

2344
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:13,840
that's a nightmare type shit.
I'm good.

2345
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:16,140
No running hills.
It's hard,

2346
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:17,340
but you know,
it's the hardest shit.

2347
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:22,140
Running sand dunes run in sand dunes is 
dark death.

2348
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:23,513
That's you just legs have nothing.
They're going through that sand and 

2349
01:49:26,671 --> 01:49:30,110
you're barely making progress.
Listened my fight with Shane car.

2350
01:49:30,111 --> 01:49:32,880
We've got canceled because I don't need 
the fucking dudes.

2351
01:49:32,881 --> 01:49:34,330
All right.
Where's Shane Shankar?

2352
01:49:34,331 --> 01:49:35,350
When going?
Shane?

2353
01:49:35,351 --> 01:49:37,350
Carolyn's going to rising.
Okay.

2354
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:38,873
Yeah.
He couldn't take it no more on the 

2355
01:49:40,850 --> 01:49:41,850
silence.
He's like,

2356
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:42,684
fuck it.
I guess he wants to have some fun while 

2357
01:49:44,641 --> 01:49:48,070
he's still Shankar,
when I salute that he could still hit

2358
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:50,170
hard in a month.
Did you see that?

2359
01:49:50,171 --> 01:49:52,960
Jason knows fight.
Do you see what crazy Jason Ellis did?

2360
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:54,663
Jason Ellis fought Shane Carwyn with one
hand tied up or Shane Karlyn had his 

2361
01:49:58,211 --> 01:50:01,040
right hand tied up to his body and so 
Jason,

2362
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,880
I was like,
you don't realize how big Shane car is.

2363
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:05,200
Like Jason knows is not the tiniest guy.
You know.

2364
01:50:05,201 --> 01:50:06,034
He's probably about 200 pounds.
Who is standing next to Shankar when it 

2365
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:11,140
is almost comical.
How will you this?

2366
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:12,250
Look how big car one is.

2367
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:16,120
I mean,
he's a giant.

2368
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:19,000
He's a fucking giant and he's got one 
arm tied up.

2369
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:19,863
Look at this and he looks good dude.
Like physically he looks jacked like he 

2370
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:27,250
hasn't fought in a while,
but obviously he's been working out.

2371
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:30,610
I mean he looks better than he did the,
did the last time I saw him.

2372
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:34,450
The last time I saw him he was 
recovering from some injuries and he was

2373
01:50:34,451 --> 01:50:35,284
still in the UFC.
So apparently he's a free agent and I 

2374
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:41,620
think,
you know,

2375
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:42,454
he's,
he's fighting for rise and I'm pretty 

2376
01:50:44,201 --> 01:50:44,921
sure,
I mean,

2377
01:50:44,921 --> 01:50:47,620
I know we put it on his instagram page,
but uh,

2378
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:50,860
he came to man,
he really kind of wrong.

2379
01:50:54,990 --> 01:50:55,980
Oh,
that was one.

2380
01:50:56,010 --> 01:50:59,690
That was one punch.
Did he hit him with that wasn't even the

2381
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,530
punch that,
that chaos is it?

2382
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:05,740
No,
that,

2383
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:07,960
that was like at the end of a round I 
think.

2384
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,230
See,
this is where it came from right here.

2385
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:17,550
So that was the second one.
I mean that one really came,

2386
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:18,443
I'm like,
you could see when he was down he was 

2387
01:51:19,031 --> 01:51:20,410
like,
fuck,

2388
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:25,860
I mean that guy is so goddamn big 
Carlin's as gigantic human.

2389
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:28,420
So they were talking about setting him 
up with fader,

2390
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:31,480
like fate or versus car one.
I don't know if that's gonna happen,

2391
01:51:31,481 --> 01:51:32,830
but if that does,
I'm in,

2392
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:36,160
I'm in,
I'm paying to see that.

2393
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:40,850
That's a dangerous fight for fader now 
was writing for a dangerous Pfizer.

2394
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:41,920
Japan.
Okay.

2395
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:46,120
So essentially the same guy who is in 
charge of a pride for awhile.

2396
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:49,000
Yeah.
And uh,

2397
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:51,010
I believe so.
And so,

2398
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:52,900
uh,
if he goes over and fights,

2399
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:57,340
if Karlyn goes over and fights in Japan 
and he fights fade or as a giant fight,

2400
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:00,373
afraid offered,
fought fabio Maldonado and barely 

2401
01:52:02,591 --> 01:52:03,424
squeaked by a fight,
a lot of people thought that he should 

2402
01:52:05,531 --> 01:52:06,610
have lost you got hurt.

2403
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:10,390
Fabio Maldonado tagged them in it.
There's no shame in that.

2404
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,930
Fabio,
Fabio Maldonado is a very good boxer.

2405
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:17,050
He rocked glover to Sherra before glover
finished him off.

2406
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,220
And,
uh,

2407
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:19,720
it was just tough shit.
He's a tough,

2408
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:20,554
tough guy.
They always call that poor guy in like 

2409
01:52:22,811 --> 01:52:26,390
they always Fabio's life.
Who are we going to get fired?

2410
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:28,600
Well,
who will be this fucking wacky to fight?

2411
01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:30,430
I should know this.
Fabio.

2412
01:52:30,431 --> 01:52:31,264
Mom,
do you remember how he saved that fight 

2413
01:52:32,741 --> 01:52:36,700
in Australia somewhere in Brazil some 
way.

2414
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:37,873
Steve Bay and heavyweight steep emile 
chick when Steve Bay's just fucking 

2415
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:42,570
tearing through the ranks,
right?

2416
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:46,640
Steve Bay's trying to get a shot at the 
title and he fights Fabio Maldonado.

2417
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:48,320
It just,
I mean,

2418
01:52:48,321 --> 01:52:50,540
Steve Ages ran through them.
It was horrific.

2419
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:52,850
And Steve Bay's a scary guy as a 
heavyweight.

2420
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:56,270
And Fabio Maldonado just was not the 
same size,

2421
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,400
just did not belong in there with them,
you know,

2422
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,790
just too big,
too strong,

2423
01:53:01,791 --> 01:53:02,480
too fast.

2424
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,160
It's too hard.
It was so scary fight.

2425
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:05,803
But um,
when you think about Fabio Rockin fader 

2426
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:13,060
and hurting him in his last fight and 
you think good lord would,

2427
01:53:13,061 --> 01:53:13,894
if he gets hit by a car when like car 
car when takes a great shot and he hits 

2428
01:53:18,231 --> 01:53:19,920
harder than anybody in the division.
He's,

2429
01:53:19,921 --> 01:53:20,754
he's probably,
he's probably one of the scariest 

2430
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:28,990
heavyweight punchers ever.
Literally ever when he fought mere,

2431
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:33,700
I remember he tied near up in a clench 
and just ripped up or cuts to his chin,

2432
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:36,710
his face and put them down and just beat
them down when you're on the ground.

2433
01:53:36,711 --> 01:53:41,711
Like car could fuck in Ponch scary 
puncher man.

2434
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:45,410
So if he's healthy like he looks like 
and that video,

2435
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,900
it looks fucking healthy to me and he 
looks huge.

2436
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:50,180
It looks like he's like,
well over to 60.

2437
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:52,850
Yeah.
I don't know if fader,

2438
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:56,390
I don't know if that's the kind of fight
he wanted to stage of his life,

2439
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:57,980
you know,
after he fought Maldonado,

2440
01:53:58,490 --> 01:54:00,380
he might be looking to fight smaller 
heavyweights.

2441
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,390
He might be looking to fight bigger 
names,

2442
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:06,290
will actually Carmen's pretty God damned
big name as far as the free market.

2443
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:09,080
But who knows what's going to happen,
man.

2444
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:11,690
You know,
with um,

2445
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,060
one of the crazy things with all these 
new organizations,

2446
01:54:14,061 --> 01:54:16,750
whether it's one FC,
whether it's uh,

2447
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:19,340
you know,
fill in the blank Bella tour,

2448
01:54:19,690 --> 01:54:20,523
rise in all these other,
like everyone is scrambling to pick up 

2449
01:54:24,051 --> 01:54:27,650
anybody who leaves the UFC so of 
people's contracts are up.

2450
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:28,673
I like,
they're starting to do and they start 

2451
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:32,750
bolting over and go into these other 
different organizations.

2452
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:33,763
Stuff can get crazy,
like things can heat up and you might 

2453
01:54:36,141 --> 01:54:39,020
see like another pride ufc type of 
rivalry,

2454
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:40,970
which I think would be great for 
everybody.

2455
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:42,163
Like if rise and really does take off,
like if rise inputs on fate or versus 

2456
01:54:45,441 --> 01:54:46,274
shame Darwin.
And then they come up with a bunch of 

2457
01:54:48,141 --> 01:54:50,920
other crazy fights for the undercard.
You know,

2458
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:53,323
just there's just not right now the same
level of talent available outside the 

2459
01:54:57,411 --> 01:54:59,270
UFC.
Not right now,

2460
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,673
but man,
it's been close a few times and it used 

2461
01:55:02,931 --> 01:55:03,890
to be,
you know,

2462
01:55:03,891 --> 01:55:05,600
obviously it used to be with pride.

2463
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:09,940
It's hard making something like that 
happen,

2464
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:10,833
you know,
I feel with like a Shane Carbon for 

2465
01:55:12,261 --> 01:55:14,600
example.
Shannon Cullen was a great father.

2466
01:55:14,601 --> 01:55:16,460
He hasn't been thrown a punch in how 
many years?

2467
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:21,950
Um,
he hasn't fought MMA since.

2468
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:24,410
I want to say it's two years ago,
two,

2469
01:55:24,411 --> 01:55:27,470
three years.
The in my world,

2470
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,480
I don't know.
I don't know.

2471
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:32,450
I'm not the professional here,
but I think the UFC marketing would know

2472
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:35,960
they could do something with Shane.
They passed on them.

2473
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,470
Maybe there's something they could do.
The heavyweight division is packed.

2474
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,450
I don't know.
I don't know the parameters of this.

2475
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:42,670
Yeah.
You know,

2476
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,150
I like when a fighter hasn't

2477
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,920
fought more than a year or two or maybe 
even three.

2478
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:49,283
I think about comedy,
Joe Rogan and I think about if I just 

2479
01:55:51,781 --> 01:55:55,970
didn't do any here for three years,
what would I be ready for?

2480
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:56,993
What would you,
you didn't do any comedy for three 

2481
01:55:58,351 --> 01:55:59,184
years,
what would you honestly booked yourself 

2482
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:02,460
for?
And fucking December.

2483
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:04,260
It's October 30.
First,

2484
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:07,050
what would you book yourself on December
the garden?

2485
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:09,973
You know,
you do like the laughing skull in 

2486
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:12,270
Atlanta.
Okay,

2487
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:15,420
nice.
A cool intimate little room.

2488
01:56:15,421 --> 01:56:16,254
Very quiet and Cedar might not have a 
lot of money and the rise in might have 

2489
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:24,300
offered them a big channel.
I understand all these parameters,

2490
01:56:24,301 --> 01:56:26,820
but I'm saying to you is,
you know,

2491
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:31,710
it's like the GSP thing that was going 
on and maybe they weren't what they were

2492
01:56:31,711 --> 01:56:34,710
and I think even as a fighter to three 
years,

2493
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,120
shit is fucking changed.

2494
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:38,880
Yes and no.
Yes and no.

2495
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:39,923
Here's the.
No,

2496
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:41,003
depends on if you're still training,
see if you decide to take some time off 

2497
01:56:43,771 --> 01:56:46,200
because you have nagging injuries or 
some fighters like that.

2498
01:56:46,201 --> 01:56:47,940
Joseph Valtellina guy we were talking 
about earlier,

2499
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:51,030
he stepped back because of concussion 
syndrome because he was getting.

2500
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:51,601
He,
you know,

2501
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:52,434
he had too many hits to the head and so 
he recognized it was having some real 

2502
01:56:55,351 --> 01:57:00,351
symptoms and he said no after resigned.
So he gave up his belt and taking two or

2503
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:02,904
three years off.
If you're having any sort of real 

2504
01:57:04,231 --> 01:57:05,064
problem,
maybe if you've got a reoccurring back 

2505
01:57:06,601 --> 01:57:08,580
injury,
which I know Shane had some bad habits.

2506
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,130
He had surgery for.
Yes.

2507
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:14,070
So maybe taking that time off.
So it was junior dos Santos was his last

2508
01:57:14,071 --> 01:57:17,250
loss and that was UFC 1:31
and wow.

2509
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:20,280
Two thousand 11.
So that's five fucking years ago.

2510
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:24,150
Almost five and a half years ago.
Guy's the heavyweight division,

2511
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:26,960
has come and gone in five years.
That's a lot.

2512
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:29,700
People want to come back and now two,
one slash 70.

2513
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:30,963
One 70 has come and gone.
Tyrone Woodley is the champion and one 

2514
01:57:35,101 --> 01:57:35,934
of the boy's number one.
These kids weren't even around when GSP 

2515
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:41,580
fucking dropped off.
Our Tyrone Woodley was.

2516
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:42,623
Well not Stephen Tom.
I mean it's a whole breath of fresh air 

2517
01:57:45,021 --> 01:57:45,854
that comes into it is I think when 
Michael Bisping was pretty smart trying 

2518
01:57:50,401 --> 01:57:53,130
to get GSP to fight him in Toronto.
Still at Man.

2519
01:57:53,131 --> 01:57:54,390
Fuck yeah,
that's a great one.

2520
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:56,820
I don't know if George wants to fight at
one 85.

2521
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,310
I think George has even said that he 
could make 1:55,

2522
01:57:59,910 --> 01:58:00,743
you know,
the difference between the size of guys 

2523
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:03,534
today versus the way they were then.
It's no guys are way more sophisticated 

2524
01:58:07,951 --> 01:58:12,090
about weight cutting and I don't think 
George lifts as much weights anymore.

2525
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:13,800
I don't think it's as big as it used to 
be.

2526
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,480
Who the fuck knows,
man?

2527
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:16,980
You know,
I don't.

2528
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:20,040
If the guy wants to compete,
the game moves,

2529
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:24,000
moves very fast.
[inaudible] has moved so much in two,

2530
01:58:24,001 --> 01:58:25,940
three years that,
you know,

2531
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:29,350
they got a lot of these people that are 
watching UFC eat.

2532
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:31,500
They don't even really know who Shane 
Koyczan one is.

2533
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:34,080
We've got a whole new batch of audience 
that's coming.

2534
01:58:34,081 --> 01:58:36,900
That is true.
Even with GSP,

2535
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:39,450
I'm a fan of GSP.
I love to see him fighting it,

2536
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:41,830
but I had to ask myself questions.
I was

2537
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,750
like,
I don't want to learn.

2538
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:45,880
It's like watching a fucking shark tank.
You know what I'm saying?

2539
01:58:45,881 --> 01:58:46,780
You want to learn.
Well,

2540
01:58:46,781 --> 01:58:47,614
I think the UFC is argument as far as 
what I had heard and this is all that 

2541
01:58:50,681 --> 01:58:52,060
shit I read online.
I don't.

2542
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:56,230
I don't talk to the UFC interested,
we read different dumb shit,

2543
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,393
but they there,
what I'd read online was that they were 

2544
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:01,743
not in agreement with how much money was
going to cost to promote a fight with 

2545
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:05,434
them and that the people that watched 
the fight today that are fans of Ronda 

2546
01:59:07,601 --> 01:59:11,440
Rousey and the fans Ican,
conor mcgregor and all these current UFC

2547
01:59:11,441 --> 01:59:14,290
fighters that maybe these fans that have
only been fans for a couple of years,

2548
01:59:14,291 --> 01:59:19,291
they kind of forgot what I was thinking 
three years run the party,

2549
01:59:20,231 --> 01:59:22,630
but she don't think that it would take 
one,

2550
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:25,420
one fucking promotional special.

2551
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,253
One thing they do on Fox or people 
remember just watch some of the fucking 

2552
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:32,170
epic fights with John Fitch,
with Bj,

2553
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:33,700
Bj Penn,
you know,

2554
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:37,390
watch him submit Matt Hughes when Matt 
Hughes at the top of the world,

2555
01:59:37,391 --> 01:59:38,224
watched him beat down Matt Serra after 
Matt Serra stomped him and won the 

2556
01:59:40,871 --> 01:59:41,704
title.
You watch some of those fights and then 

2557
01:59:43,451 --> 01:59:45,430
you hear him talk and see what a 
gentleman he is.

2558
01:59:46,290 --> 01:59:47,040
Come on,
man.

2559
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,220
Come on guys.
Golden.

2560
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:49,073
I love him to Golden.
Even the foreign names you mentioned 

2561
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:53,230
that fucking dying.
This was.

2562
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:54,640
I agree.
You know what?

2563
01:59:54,641 --> 01:59:57,910
I think a guy like gsps to do,
he's got to do a tune up fight.

2564
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:02,110
I really believe that.
I think that would help everybody.

2565
02:00:02,111 --> 02:00:04,030
I think that's what you would do in 
boxing.

2566
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:08,710
The only one that never did that as 
sugar ray Leonard went out of retirement

2567
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:12,520
right to Marvin Hagler.
Oh right,

2568
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,480
right in there.

2569
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:16,300
Just jumped right into Marvin fucking 
hagler and everybody was like,

2570
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:18,310
you're crazy.
You need a tune up fight.

2571
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:21,270
And apparently he had some gym.
Fine.

2572
02:00:21,271 --> 02:00:22,104
So they set up some smokers in the gym 
just sorta like we were talking about 

2573
02:00:25,691 --> 02:00:28,400
earlier that they do with the moisture 
that he beat him.

2574
02:00:28,510 --> 02:00:31,090
Beat him by decision.
Very controversial fight though.

2575
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:33,250
Some people think that Marvin should 
have one.

2576
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:37,420
I would say it's probably one of those 
fights where it was almost 50 slash 50.

2577
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,360
Most my friends,
it was at least amongst a lot of people.

2578
02:00:40,361 --> 02:00:43,240
I knew a lot of people thought that 
Marvin had did more damage.

2579
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:45,730
It landed the hardest shots with sugar I
was dealing with.

2580
02:00:45,731 --> 02:00:48,610
Just throw a pity pat punches and it 
wasn't good enough.

2581
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:50,620
And Marvin was chasing them down.
I don't know,

2582
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:51,513
it's a,
I'd have to watch it again as an adult 

2583
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:56,200
who understands fighting better.

2584
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:57,693
But,
uh,

2585
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,770
whatever it was,
he didn't get destroyed.

2586
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:02,710
And that's better than you could say for
a lot of people that fought hagler.

2587
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:04,023
Hagler was fucking Hagler.
That's the haggar that crushed John the 

2588
02:01:06,521 --> 02:01:08,590
beast.
Mugabi remember that shit.

2589
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:12,340
That's the Marvin Hagler that beat the 
fuck out of Tommy hearns.

2590
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:16,750
I mean,
Marvin Hagler was a monster when I was a

2591
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:17,584
kid.
They had this fucking TV show that they 

2592
02:01:19,961 --> 02:01:24,550
showed were haggard was training for my 
staff ham show and uh,

2593
02:01:24,670 --> 02:01:27,790
he was running on the beach in the Cape 
in the winter.

2594
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:31,930
He's running on the sand and Cape Cod 
screaming war,

2595
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:34,990
just running,
screaming,

2596
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:38,240
Wah,
Wah.

2597
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:43,760
This who's just sure at shredded.
I mean,

2598
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:48,980
Marvin Hagler in his prime had one of 
the best physiques ever for a boxer.

2599
02:01:48,981 --> 02:01:49,814
And he was in supreme condition and he 
was known for maybe not being like the 

2600
02:01:54,321 --> 02:01:55,154
slickest most technical boxer,
like maybe sugar ray was or Roberto 

2601
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,273
Duran was.
But overwhelming discipline and drive 

2602
02:02:04,041 --> 02:02:07,370
and ferocity who will just break dudes 
down,

2603
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:09,410
you know like you did with the Tommy 
hearns fight,

2604
02:02:09,411 --> 02:02:12,290
was the purest expression of Marvin 
agler.

2605
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:13,393
Just skimming.
These guys are fighting for the fucking 

2606
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:15,453
middleweight championship of the world.
It's a giant fight between two 

2607
02:02:17,571 --> 02:02:19,280
superstars.
And what do they do?

2608
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,520
They just throw caution to the wind and 
meet in the center of the ring and start

2609
02:02:24,891 --> 02:02:28,160
throwing bombs.
There was no boxing in that fight.

2610
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:31,490
That was a war.
That was a crazy war.

2611
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:33,260
Throw that shit up.
Shut up.

2612
02:02:33,261 --> 02:02:36,110
Marvin hagler versus Tommy hearns.
Fuck.

2613
02:02:36,150 --> 02:02:39,140
Because that was like talking to them.
Put this motherfucker.

2614
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:44,120
Just a massive risk taking endeavor to 
step in there.

2615
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:47,840
Those two guys,
as big as they were in their prime,

2616
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:50,750
those dudes were gigantic.
Pretty rough disco.

2617
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:53,270
I think it was two rounds.
I think you knocked him out in a second.

2618
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:54,860
Yeah,
if at the most.

2619
02:02:54,861 --> 02:02:55,694
It was the third,
but I'm pretty sure it's fuck is wrong 

2620
02:02:57,141 --> 02:02:57,980
with Jamie.

2621
02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:02,280
Does your own bumps?
What were you looking for?

2622
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:05,400
Trying to find which version of the 
fight I was going to pull up.

2623
02:03:05,401 --> 02:03:07,960
What does it say?
What I started,

2624
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:09,023
I'm pretty sure he knocked him out in 
the second round if I remember 

2625
02:03:10,651 --> 02:03:11,910
correctly,
but I might be wrong.

2626
02:03:11,911 --> 02:03:12,770
It might be the third,

2627
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:17,670
but either way it was just chaos.
Now that I'm thinking about it,

2628
02:03:17,671 --> 02:03:18,504
thinking it was the third.

2629
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:22,513
Tell us that too.
I'm trying to look for that before I 

2630
02:03:23,931 --> 02:03:25,910
pull up the video.
Do you got a video?

2631
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:29,720
Just throw the video on.
We'll figure it out when he gets knocked

2632
02:03:29,721 --> 02:03:30,554
out,
but I mean we had talked about Tommy 

2633
02:03:35,201 --> 02:03:37,930
hearns the other day when Tommy hearns 
knocked out Roberto Duran.

2634
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:40,270
That was one of the most spectacular 
knockouts ever.

2635
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:43,150
Look at this.
Look at Tommy hearns was awesome.

2636
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:47,350
He had a big crazy afro.
He had a back that was so wide.

2637
02:03:47,351 --> 02:03:48,184
It looks like he was a flying squirrel.
Like you could jump off a building and 

2638
02:03:50,621 --> 02:03:52,900
sort of safety.
I mean,

2639
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:57,580
he was so unusually built and he was 
shredded too.

2640
02:03:58,030 --> 02:04:01,150
He was a.
He was built scary in a different way

2641
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:03,030
and then hagler

2642
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:06,850
he was the ultimate throwback.
I mean,

2643
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:10,830
you're talking in the 19 eighties.
He was a throwback.

2644
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:11,783
We,
they thought of him as a throwback in 

2645
02:04:12,821 --> 02:04:16,150
the eighties,
like you thought of him the same way,

2646
02:04:16,151 --> 02:04:16,984
so he was 30 then,
which is kinda crazy because this is 

2647
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:20,173
like the tail end of the Haggar career.
I think haggard only fought is like 35 

2648
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:27,580
and then he retired after the sugar ray 
Leonard fight.

2649
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,630
But this was Hagler,
you know,

2650
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:35,430
when he to agler this was 30 years old.
This is as good as it fucking guts.

2651
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:40,460
Five foot nine,
160 pounds and just a fucking dynamo.

2652
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:47,210
And you know,
the weird thing,

2653
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:48,163
one of the weirdest things about Hagler 
God are they still have watched that 

2654
02:04:50,141 --> 02:04:52,420
dude five.
He had natural.

2655
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:56,570
I'm like head gear.
He had really thick mode.

2656
02:04:56,590 --> 02:04:58,250
Look at that beautiful right hand.
These guys.

2657
02:04:58,390 --> 02:05:01,300
These guys are winging it at each other.
Oh my God,

2658
02:05:01,301 --> 02:05:05,010
this is crazy.
The thing about haggars,

2659
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,330
he also could take a tremendous punch,
like a trim.

2660
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:11,050
That exchange.
He was very smart,

2661
02:05:11,051 --> 02:05:11,884
right?
Yeah.

2662
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:12,743
What was very composed,
but he had natural thick muscle all 

2663
02:05:16,721 --> 02:05:17,554
above his ears.
Like his temple area was almost 

2664
02:05:20,201 --> 02:05:25,030
protected by like thick muscle.
And I don't know what that's from,

2665
02:05:25,031 --> 02:05:28,270
whether it's like from some biting 
exercises that he had done because there

2666
02:05:28,271 --> 02:05:32,980
was a bunch of guys who did have some 
devices to strengthen your jaw.

2667
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:37,390
And Gerry Cooney used one before he 
fought George Foreman.

2668
02:05:37,391 --> 02:05:38,224
I remember seeing it.
It's like this thing you put in his 

2669
02:05:39,551 --> 02:05:40,384
mouth and it was like a.
He would bite down on it and lift 

2670
02:05:43,811 --> 02:05:44,644
weights with it.
So he's like pulling a cord and lifting 

2671
02:05:46,541 --> 02:05:49,550
weights with his jaw.
Well,

2672
02:05:49,570 --> 02:05:52,090
I don't know if hackers was just natural
just born with it,

2673
02:05:52,091 --> 02:05:54,940
but whatever it was is you can kind of 
see it in the shape of his head.

2674
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:57,560
You see is right in this hitman's right 
now.

2675
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:01,900
He pops it right at him.
He steps to his left arm.

2676
02:06:01,901 --> 02:06:04,780
Just goes up like a short distance.
Fucking amazing.

2677
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:08,470
Yeah.
Tommy hearns broke his hand somewhere in

2678
02:06:08,471 --> 02:06:09,460
the,
in the round.

2679
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:14,420
And those fucking bombs.
You strong muscle head.

2680
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:15,970
Sure.
You going to break something?

2681
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,811
Look at this.
Well,

2682
02:06:16,811 --> 02:06:19,720
you throw full power bombs and hit 
somebody in the top of the head.

2683
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:20,593
Something's to go.
That top of the head doesn't move very 

2684
02:06:22,541 --> 02:06:23,374
much.
That's where a lot of guys will break 

2685
02:06:24,521 --> 02:06:27,430
their hands.
It's hitting guys on the forehead.

2686
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:30,303
This is just a crazy fight.
The Marvin Hagler just absorbing it and 

2687
02:06:33,071 --> 02:06:33,904
then he starts putting the pressure on 
her and so we're like two minutes into 

2688
02:06:36,881 --> 02:06:37,714
the round now and hearns is started to 
throw weaker and weaker punches and now 

2689
02:06:41,651 --> 02:06:44,770
haggars muscle and I'm up against the 
corner and just beating them down.

2690
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:51,780
That's one of the big things about 
Hagler was his endurance,

2691
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:53,003
his pace and just the will that he had 
the will to fight a fight like this 

2692
02:06:57,511 --> 02:07:00,810
where you just stand right in front of a
guy like Tommy hearns and said,

2693
02:07:00,811 --> 02:07:02,730
dude,
you are not going to knock me out.

2694
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:04,680
You can't knock me out.
You don't understand.

2695
02:07:05,750 --> 02:07:09,060
You think you could knock me out,
but I'm going to stay right here.

2696
02:07:09,061 --> 02:07:11,010
Like nobody fought Tommy hearns like 
that.

2697
02:07:11,011 --> 02:07:11,844
Everybody will want to stay the fuck 
away from these punches with hagler 

2698
02:07:15,331 --> 02:07:18,120
could absorb punches like almost like no
one else.

2699
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:22,450
He got knocked down once and his whole 
career and it was a bullshit knockdown.

2700
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:25,390
The referee called it a knocked down,
but if you look at it,

2701
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:26,603
it doesn't look like jet.
Most people agree that it wasn't a good 

2702
02:07:29,401 --> 02:07:30,234
knock down.
I don't remember the fighter he fought 

2703
02:07:31,711 --> 02:07:32,790
to.
I think it was one role,

2704
02:07:32,791 --> 02:07:34,410
Dan,
I'm pretty sure,

2705
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:35,980
but it was more of like

2706
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:39,340
he like Kinda shoved him down.
Then knocked him down.

2707
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:40,293
You know when you was like Tommy hearns 
and some other boxes like Roberto Duran 

2708
02:07:43,811 --> 02:07:47,350
or something.
You could tell that they were raw talent

2709
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:48,184
and walked into a gym and they worked 
with somebody really good and they 

2710
02:07:50,711 --> 02:07:51,544
learned how to box will.
I see Marvin Hagler and I see like the 

2711
02:07:54,371 --> 02:07:56,340
guy you were talking about before,
that's 49.

2712
02:07:56,341 --> 02:08:00,760
I know floyd mayweather mayweather when 
I watched them box.

2713
02:08:00,761 --> 02:08:03,850
I think that that's.
This is as good as it gets.

2714
02:08:03,851 --> 02:08:05,380
What I watch,
Floyd Mayweather.

2715
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:06,243
What?
I just watched this fucking animal dude 

2716
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:08,373
was standing in front of them,
but as intelligent as a boxer can 

2717
02:08:12,011 --> 02:08:14,740
because we all know if I throw something
that means I'm open.

2718
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:19,650
He throw a lot being in front of him,
he's like sucking him men.

2719
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:22,210
He's doing something to them.
Which is,

2720
02:08:22,211 --> 02:08:24,970
and this is what I see this now as an 
adult,

2721
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:27,470
you don't see this when you're 20 
fucking through.

2722
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:31,510
You just see stupidity.
But this is where I see his smarts.

2723
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:32,920
He's fucking smart,
man.

2724
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:33,843
Well,
he's also,

2725
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:37,720
and Tommy,
he's doing of wisdom is something that,

2726
02:08:37,721 --> 02:08:39,100
I don't know,
I'm not a boxer,

2727
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:42,610
but I could see that he's got a plan.
He's not like,

2728
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:43,463
you know,
he's not doing a vandelay standing in 

2729
02:08:45,881 --> 02:08:47,200
front of you.
You know,

2730
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:48,640
he's,
he's very smart.

2731
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,270
Fucking amazing.
When you watch this type of shit,

2732
02:08:52,271 --> 02:08:53,104
what you learn.
He was just such a pleasing boxer to 

2733
02:08:55,541 --> 02:09:00,541
watch the way move to all that Bob and 
weave in and head movement and you know,

2734
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:05,350
Marvin had just that like track you down
style too.

2735
02:09:05,351 --> 02:09:06,184
Like you knew he was coming forward like
Marvin Hagler wasn't doing any fancy 

2736
02:09:08,651 --> 02:09:11,560
foot work or you know,
doing the Ali shuffle.

2737
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:14,770
He was moving towards you,
looking to break you.

2738
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:17,170
Oh,
and those Mugabe's you mentioned.

2739
02:09:17,171 --> 02:09:18,160
And those other guys.

2740
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:23,260
They were fucking killer killers,
killers explained boxing in those days.

2741
02:09:23,261 --> 02:09:27,100
It's Kinda today compare it to.
It's no comparison.

2742
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:32,110
Look at this on the left and this is 
where it starts coming on strong.

2743
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:33,800
So I think we're in the second round,
right?

2744
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:35,710
Right.
I think he stops him here.

2745
02:09:35,711 --> 02:09:38,730
I think if I remember the third boom,
boom.

2746
02:09:38,731 --> 02:09:41,620
And they stops him in the third or this 
is the third.

2747
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:42,581
Oh,
okay.

2748
02:09:42,581 --> 02:09:45,610
So this is where he starts hurting them.
Damn.

2749
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:49,360
But he's got this number right,
because he's got his number and he's not

2750
02:09:49,361 --> 02:09:51,220
even going in like a savage either.
Again,

2751
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,353
very composed.
Watch them again before this round is 

2752
02:09:55,271 --> 02:09:58,990
over at each one of those types.
It's just cutting up the fucking tree.

2753
02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:00,760
Well he's not giving them any air 
either.

2754
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:02,273
Boom.
Those are the guys that don't give you 

2755
02:10:04,541 --> 02:10:05,374
any breaks.
Those guys the scariest because you can 

2756
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:08,470
never recover.

2757
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:11,950
So if a guy like Tommy hearns unloads 
his best shit on you and then breaks his

2758
02:10:11,951 --> 02:10:13,330
hand.
So he's got one hand.

2759
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:15,820
I don't know which one.
I believe he hurt his right hand.

2760
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:16,983
So he's got a left hand,
his right hand is all fucked up and he 

2761
02:10:19,841 --> 02:10:21,490
can't really knock you out with it 
anymore.

2762
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:23,710
He's fucked.
So now he's trying to kind of try to hit

2763
02:10:23,711 --> 02:10:28,480
you with big left hooks and Marvin never
let some stop.

2764
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:31,510
Never let them take that breath.
Always keeps him moving,

2765
02:10:31,570 --> 02:10:34,130
always keep that pressure on him and 
he's just wielding

2766
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:36,860
where every second of every round he's 
wilting.

2767
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:39,200
And in these exchanges where it takes a 
break,

2768
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:42,410
you hit him with some hard shots and you
just keep piling it on.

2769
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,580
Key.
Pilot it on.

2770
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:46,340
That was an exciting,
exciting era of boxing.

2771
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:49,160
You could wear his socks all the way up 
to your knees,

2772
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:50,883
get athletic socks with stripes on them 
for these pay per view of as I used to 

2773
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:56,390
go to the metal heads.
Yeah.

2774
02:10:56,391 --> 02:11:00,170
So you would go to the meadowlands race 
track and that would be inclusive in the

2775
02:11:00,171 --> 02:11:04,070
price of the fucking track that night.
What's the gamble?

2776
02:11:04,071 --> 02:11:07,280
What's the fight?
I forget who I saw Marvin hagler fight.

2777
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:10,430
How many times are the haggler flight?
Tummy hurts just once.

2778
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:12,680
Okay.
Tommy hearns didn't want no more of this

2779
02:11:12,681 --> 02:11:13,514
shit.
Who did is fight a couple times sugar 

2780
02:11:15,021 --> 02:11:16,980
ray.
That's who I saw at the the boom,

2781
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:18,140
the left hook.
Boom,

2782
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:19,190
the right hand.
Boom,

2783
02:11:19,191 --> 02:11:20,150
left hook,
right hand.

2784
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:24,560
God Damn had Tommy her to survive this.
See now Marvin is pouring it on.

2785
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:26,150
Look at this.
Jesus Christ.

2786
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:27,490
Look at his hands.
Joe Rogan did.

2787
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:31,790
He hasn't moved this beautiful.
Just beautiful,

2788
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:32,653
beautiful box and look.
Same pace that he had in the first 

2789
02:11:34,461 --> 02:11:35,294
round.
I mean mark was just beating down on 

2790
02:11:37,081 --> 02:11:39,320
him.
Just putting it on him.

2791
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:42,500
God is a great fight.
Such a great fight.

2792
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:45,900
So yeah,
Tommy makes it out of the second round.

2793
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:47,300
Wow.
See My.

2794
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:48,510
That's one of those things,
man,

2795
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:49,673
in your brain,
you have a memory and it's like a false 

2796
02:11:51,811 --> 02:11:52,644
memory and sometimes you have to watch 
the fight to see it because it's just 

2797
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:57,383
the case with everything though.
There's so many memories that you have 

2798
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:01,860
from just a few years ago.
You wonder like,

2799
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:03,450
man,
how did that really go down?

2800
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,930
Let me watch it again.
What was that movie really like?

2801
02:12:07,410 --> 02:12:08,910
Yeah.
Let me watch that fight again.

2802
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:12,540
The human memory is real weird.

2803
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:16,960
That's the saddest things about these 
boxers too,

2804
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:19,480
when they get older and older and more 
fucked up.

2805
02:12:19,481 --> 02:12:21,640
As you know,
the memories.

2806
02:12:21,641 --> 02:12:23,530
One of the big ones that goes well,
that's one of the.

2807
02:12:23,531 --> 02:12:25,240
One of the things that I've heard you 
talk about,

2808
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:29,020
like let's say somebody has a fight on a
Saturday,

2809
02:12:29,021 --> 02:12:29,854
they have a close decision.
You'll watch it again Sunday when you 

2810
02:12:32,831 --> 02:12:35,050
get home.
Then you will watch it for a few days,

2811
02:12:35,051 --> 02:12:35,884
let the eat to wear off and then watch 
it again and you'll see the true winner 

2812
02:12:39,281 --> 02:12:41,140
if you know how to count points and the 
bullshit.

2813
02:12:42,030 --> 02:12:44,870
You know the problem with picking a true
winter though I,

2814
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:45,853
I sometimes make subjective decisions in
my own head that go back and forth like 

2815
02:12:49,631 --> 02:12:53,140
I'm not always convinced that I'm right 
like you.

2816
02:12:53,141 --> 02:12:56,740
If you look at a guy who lands harder 
shots but less of them,

2817
02:12:56,950 --> 02:13:00,820
like here's a good example,
Dan Henderson versus Michael Bisping.

2818
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:05,190
Now Michael Bisping thinks he won and 
the judges think you want,

2819
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:08,020
and a lot of people think he won because
he landed more shots,

2820
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:10,060
controlled,
more moments of the fight.

2821
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:11,253
Dan Henderson thinks he won because he 
hurt Michael Bisping a couple of 

2822
02:13:14,801 --> 02:13:16,300
occasions,
beat him up.

2823
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:20,320
His face was really battered and in the 
first round in particular,

2824
02:13:20,321 --> 02:13:23,510
he came way closer to stopping the fight
then

2825
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:29,040
than bisping ever did to him.
So I could see that argument as well,

2826
02:13:29,041 --> 02:13:34,041
that those moments where he had 
incredibly damaged should be worth a lot

2827
02:13:34,561 --> 02:13:37,080
of points.
I see those arguments,

2828
02:13:37,081 --> 02:13:37,710
man.
I don't.

2829
02:13:37,710 --> 02:13:40,320
I don't know who's right or who's wrong.
Quite honestly.

2830
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:41,213
I could see both arguments.
I see bisping's argument makes a ton of 

2831
02:13:43,651 --> 02:13:46,020
sense to me.
He put in more work,

2832
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:48,100
he landed more shots.
He,

2833
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:51,840
he came back from getting really badly 
hurt,

2834
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:55,350
which showed amazing heart and cardio.
I see that argument too,

2835
02:13:55,860 --> 02:14:00,300
so it's like deciding who wins and loses
a fight isn't always very clear.

2836
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:03,720
There's different philosophies like you 
talked to a wrestler,

2837
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:04,703
he's way more impressive.
The guy that takes the guy down a bunch 

2838
02:14:06,211 --> 02:14:07,044
of times.
Then a guy who lands some brutal leg 

2839
02:14:08,371 --> 02:14:11,430
kicks in the third round,
but if you talk to a Moitai Guy,

2840
02:14:11,431 --> 02:14:11,881
he'll go,
yeah,

2841
02:14:11,881 --> 02:14:13,290
well what happened in those first two 
rounds?

2842
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,311
Yeah,
he took me down,

2843
02:14:14,311 --> 02:14:16,230
but he didn't do anything once.
He had me down.

2844
02:14:16,290 --> 02:14:18,450
So the only thing is he's laying on me.
I'm not getting hurt,

2845
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:22,050
but in that third round I fucked him up 
and you listen to what he said and go,

2846
02:14:22,051 --> 02:14:22,884
wow,
that is a good point because that guy's 

2847
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:25,830
damaged like you damaged his leg.
Yeah.

2848
02:14:25,831 --> 02:14:28,830
There's the Kao Woo.
Show that again,

2849
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:33,240
so that you're a barrage.
Wow.

2850
02:14:33,241 --> 02:14:35,580
This is 85.
Watch this shit.

2851
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:38,220
God Damn Man.
Yeah,

2852
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:39,270
I was in high school,
Dude.

2853
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,890
This is when I was a senior in high 
school.

2854
02:14:40,891 --> 02:14:41,724
This was a tough fight.
I remember watching this with my jaw 

2855
02:14:44,590 --> 02:14:45,423
just hanging down like wow.
Because I thought it was going to be a 

2856
02:14:50,011 --> 02:14:50,844
crazy fight and it was a crazy fight,
but I never thought it was going to be 

2857
02:14:53,581 --> 02:14:55,920
this.
This was so crazy.

2858
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,470
And Marvin Hagler just mauled him.
I mean,

2859
02:14:58,471 --> 02:15:00,090
he kind of shut everybody up,
man,

2860
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:03,800
because there was a lot of people that 
thought Tommy hearns going to knock them

2861
02:15:03,801 --> 02:15:05,570
out.
It thought that he had never been hit.

2862
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,430
Oh,
so you went a little bit too far back.

2863
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:11,210
This is where they checked his cut and 
uh,

2864
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:12,590
well they checked his cut.
They were,

2865
02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:15,500
you know,
Tommy hearns and nailed them a couple of

2866
02:15:15,501 --> 02:15:18,110
times and Hagler is probably worried 
about them stopping the fight.

2867
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:24,990
Was that just God knows what the fuck I 
was doing.

2868
02:15:24,991 --> 02:15:28,410
I was in Jersey and hygienists.
I'm shit 85.

2869
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:32,940
Tommy hearns had such a good job.
Just snap it out at you.

2870
02:15:33,210 --> 02:15:34,043
And what those long arms.
He used to keep his hand like below his 

2871
02:15:36,151 --> 02:15:37,580
trunks,
you know,

2872
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:40,470
like below the waistband of his trunks 
and just pop it right in your face.

2873
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:44,220
Like see how he did it there?
Oh Shit,

2874
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:46,020
boom.
This is it.

2875
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:47,700
Boom.
That lasts right hand.

2876
02:15:47,750 --> 02:15:50,040
And then that left.
Wow.

2877
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:56,470
That was one of the greatest boxing 
fights in boxing finishes of all time,

2878
02:15:57,250 --> 02:15:58,870
of all time.
Especially.

2879
02:15:59,230 --> 02:16:00,063
It's hard today to understand what it 
was like when I was in high school when 

2880
02:16:03,251 --> 02:16:06,550
this was going on because this was a.
It was just,

2881
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:08,740
there was no internet.
Right,

2882
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:13,360
so this is,
this is just word of mouth and radio,

2883
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:15,250
you know,
you'd hear about it on the radio,

2884
02:16:15,251 --> 02:16:17,340
he'd see the newspaper,
you'd look in the box.

2885
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:19,310
It was,
fuck yeah,

2886
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:21,100
it was paper view and you didn't see 
Dick.

2887
02:16:21,130 --> 02:16:22,810
You had to go somewhere,
you got to go somewhere.

2888
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:25,150
He had to go somewhere and you had to 
watch it in a theater.

2889
02:16:25,151 --> 02:16:29,050
We would pay it would,
they would call closed circuit closed.

2890
02:16:29,410 --> 02:16:31,510
They didn't call it paper view back then
you say,

2891
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:32,940
oh,
well how do we see the fight?

2892
02:16:32,941 --> 02:16:33,970
Oh,
it's closed circuit.

2893
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,073
So you would go there and you'd pay a 
ticket and then you go sit in a movie 

2894
02:16:37,571 --> 02:16:38,404
theater,
a bunch of other savages and you guys 

2895
02:16:39,581 --> 02:16:41,260
would all watch the boxing match 
together.

2896
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:44,800
That's how I saw sugar ray and Hagler 
close circuit.

2897
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,710
I think I saw,
like I said,

2898
02:16:46,711 --> 02:16:50,830
I saw the haggler sugar ray at the track
and there was another one that I went.

2899
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:53,950
It wasn't more like seats.
It was like general admission.

2900
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:54,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

2901
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:55,473
I saw it wasn't like seats.
I saw Tyson fight like that standing 

2902
02:16:58,661 --> 02:17:00,460
room only and they put on this big 
screen.

2903
02:17:00,461 --> 02:17:01,294
It was outside.
They put on a big screen and then they 

2904
02:17:03,461 --> 02:17:05,290
played the commentary to the crowd was 
crazy.

2905
02:17:05,291 --> 02:17:06,124
It was like a giant,
like almost like a drive in movie 

2906
02:17:08,141 --> 02:17:10,330
theater,
but they had speakers and stuff that was

2907
02:17:10,331 --> 02:17:14,320
in vegas.
I fought Frank Bruno and uh,

2908
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:15,193
they were fighting in Vegas,
but I didn't have the money for the 

2909
02:17:16,421 --> 02:17:17,450
fucking tickets.
Tickets.

2910
02:17:17,510 --> 02:17:18,343
Stupid expensive thousand.
Tyson Tyson says prime and Frank Bruno 

2911
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,700
might've been the best built guy to ever
box heavyweight ever.

2912
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,500
You ever see Frank Bruno?
Do you remember?

2913
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:35,820
Jesus Christ last fight I watched Tyson 
fight was maybe like when he knocked out

2914
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:36,890
spinks.
Oh yeah.

2915
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:39,810
The city.
My friend had a party,

2916
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:42,460
you know,
the whole fucking first room,

2917
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:43,593
the pizza them and get the.
I think Bruno was actually before 

2918
02:17:45,821 --> 02:17:47,800
spinks.
Maybe I'm wrong,

2919
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,690
I think I'm wrong.
I think I'm wrong.

2920
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,540
I think spinks was first and Bruna was 
later,

2921
02:17:52,541 --> 02:17:54,070
but um,
I'm,

2922
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:55,440
I,
I don't know,

2923
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:56,373
but Frank Bruno,
so just pull up a picture of him so you 

2924
02:17:58,661 --> 02:18:00,010
could see them,
but you know,

2925
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:02,260
you can see here from the fight that 
dude was yoked,

2926
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:05,470
but some pictures of Frank Bruno just 
fucking ridiculous.

2927
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:06,633
He's just act like.
And he was an argument that a lot of a 

2928
02:18:12,190 --> 02:18:17,190
boxing trainers used to use that you 
can't be that muscular and uh,

2929
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,410
being effective heavyweight boxer 
because he was.

2930
02:18:20,411 --> 02:18:22,450
So that's where Jones' son,
you're racist.

2931
02:18:23,050 --> 02:18:24,490
Jamie,
how dare you.

2932
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:26,050
Who is that?
Oh,

2933
02:18:26,051 --> 02:18:27,820
how dare you.
It was Roy Jones,

2934
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:31,590
but I'm like,
that's him now though.

2935
02:18:31,690 --> 02:18:33,430
See,
look how fat Ricky Hatton.

2936
02:18:33,431 --> 02:18:34,720
God,
Holy Shit.

2937
02:18:35,050 --> 02:18:38,680
Damn Ricky.
Um,

2938
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:41,980
there's a good picture of two.
Dude was just jacked and that's him.

2939
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:45,550
Obviously he's not even fighting.
There is like,

2940
02:18:46,250 --> 02:18:50,890
you just see without him even flexing,
like not at full muscle flex.

2941
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:53,290
He's still super jacked

2942
02:18:56,410 --> 02:18:59,650
and he'd beat a lot of guys up,
but Tyson marked them.

2943
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:01,383
But that again,
that was when Tyson was Tyson dude says 

2944
02:19:03,911 --> 02:19:04,930
Tyson.
Bruno one.

2945
02:19:04,931 --> 02:19:07,180
I didn't know they fought twice.
Oh yeah.

2946
02:19:07,181 --> 02:19:08,620
I think he stomped him twice.

2947
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:13,350
Let me ask you,
what year was this?

2948
02:19:14,490 --> 02:19:16,260
Just said it.
80 nine.

2949
02:19:16,530 --> 02:19:20,780
How was the testing in those days?
There was no gi test.

2950
02:19:21,610 --> 02:19:23,850
No.
That's why these guys showed up.

2951
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:25,740
Fuck.
Like Ken Norton when I was a kid,

2952
02:19:25,741 --> 02:19:28,250
Ken Norton was the biggest motherfuck 
have his own my life.

2953
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:32,320
Was he bones at those times or was 
Kennedy's natural,

2954
02:19:32,590 --> 02:19:33,423
do you think?
They did that in the seventies and it 

2955
02:19:34,541 --> 02:19:36,230
was.
There wasn't a lot of options,

2956
02:19:36,231 --> 02:19:38,360
I think is steroids.
I like to check.

2957
02:19:38,361 --> 02:19:40,100
What were the options?
Maybe the Germans,

2958
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:41,800
Adam,
they definitely had them.

2959
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,640
The Germans had them.
There was definitely.

2960
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:46,810
He just looks like an athlete.
You make an athlete there.

2961
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:50,750
But there was one fight that Ken Norton 
did look a little yoked.

2962
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:52,910
Well,
he was a big guy when he fought Muhammad

2963
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:54,140
Ali.
He broke his jaw.

2964
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:57,800
I mean he was a serious athlete and he 
was a former pro football player,

2965
02:19:58,010 --> 02:19:58,520
right?

2966
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:02,120
Wasn't.
He says marine marine toughness.

2967
02:20:02,121 --> 02:20:04,650
And I believe Ken Norton Played 
Professional Football,

2968
02:20:04,651 --> 02:20:06,710
so definitely did Sunday,
Sunday.

2969
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:08,380
Is that what it is?
I didn't.

2970
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:10,880
I just know that it's Sunday.
That must be what I'm thinking of.

2971
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,430
But Ken Norton was a bad motherfucker.
Dude.

2972
02:20:13,431 --> 02:20:16,430
He actually got,
he's pretty badly banged up now,

2973
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:17,503
but not from boxing.
He got in a car accident and apparently 

2974
02:20:20,901 --> 02:20:22,520
got really hurt.
And that car accident,

2975
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,460
did you see this over the weekend?
That happened in a box?

2976
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:28,850
I did one mile one.
Well Lopez,

2977
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:31,550
he take his code,
we're afraid of Alaska is junior.

2978
02:20:31,551 --> 02:20:34,640
And then when after his trainer punches 
trainer in the face.

2979
02:20:34,850 --> 02:20:35,683
So that dude went down and then he goes 
up to the guys trainer and I don't know 

2980
02:20:38,571 --> 02:20:43,571
what the fuck the trainer said,
but he goes right out to them.

2981
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:46,390
Do.
They're throwing bombs at each other.

2982
02:20:48,730 --> 02:20:50,650
Hilarious.
And that he's pointing at him.

2983
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:53,390
Why are you pointing at him?
He started it.

2984
02:20:53,410 --> 02:20:55,330
Is that what you're saying?
God.

2985
02:20:55,331 --> 02:20:57,430
Craziness.
People are nuts.

2986
02:20:59,430 --> 02:21:00,900
But that's a nutty sport,
you know,

2987
02:21:00,901 --> 02:21:02,430
like what we were talking about earlier.
Would that,

2988
02:21:02,431 --> 02:21:03,264
uh,
hold floyd floyd mayweather thing like 

2989
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:08,580
that kind of sport.
You're going to have things like that.

2990
02:21:08,610 --> 02:21:12,540
You're gonna have people that want to 
have 30 minute fights in the gym,

2991
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:13,980
like 30 minute rounds.

2992
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:18,260
It's pretty,
it's ridiculous.

2993
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:20,810
But it makes sense when you think of 
this sport,

2994
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:22,123
you know,
what the sport really kind of 

2995
02:21:23,141 --> 02:21:23,974
represents.
It's like the extreme nature of those 

2996
02:21:27,111 --> 02:21:28,730
guys who compete in it.
It's just,

2997
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:30,013
it's crazy that the athletic commission 
got pissed at people throwing water 

2998
02:21:32,931 --> 02:21:35,390
bottles but didn't get pissed at him for
doing that.

2999
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:37,820
It's,
you know,

3000
02:21:38,810 --> 02:21:40,670
I get it.
I get it.

3001
02:21:40,671 --> 02:21:42,110
If you're floyd mayweather,
I get it.

3002
02:21:42,111 --> 02:21:42,980
I mean,
that's how you,

3003
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:44,810
that's how you become that guy in the 
first place.

3004
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,433
You get brought up fate or there's talk 
of him fighting Matt [inaudible] 

3005
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:52,070
supposedly according to,
um,

3006
02:21:52,730 --> 02:21:55,430
um,
someone that I know that is not true.

3007
02:21:56,090 --> 02:21:57,070
How about that?
Alright,

3008
02:21:57,410 --> 02:21:59,420
well that's,
but they might be.

3009
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:00,980
Who knows,
people might be trolling.

3010
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:07,030
That might be a good fight though.
Fate and Mitzrian fate.

3011
02:22:07,050 --> 02:22:12,050
Orin car.
When I liked better in rising in Japan.

3012
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:13,650
Jody,
Jodie,

3013
02:22:13,970 --> 02:22:15,730
jody.
I'm.

3014
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:20,090
Tell me about Chicago last time I saw 
fucking the Fado.

3015
02:22:20,091 --> 02:22:21,350
I love them to death,
you know,

3016
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:22,850
I caught the tail end,
the fatal.

3017
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:26,340
I quite like the two fights before

3018
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:30,480
he got on board.
Right by a boy part first.

3019
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:32,370
And you saw the fights that he won 
before that?

3020
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:33,233
Yeah,
like two fights and then a beat Brett 

3021
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:39,300
Rogers.
And then um,

3022
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:41,540
I think the next fight after Brett 
riders.

3023
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:44,900
Pretty sure it was fair to him.
I didn't catch a fade or in his hay days

3024
02:22:44,901 --> 02:22:47,570
when I'm trying to say,
so the last couple of times I went,

3025
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:48,413
it was like how people said they wanted,
they went to the checks at the end and 

3026
02:22:51,121 --> 02:22:53,990
they got all excited and went down and 
it was so that.

3027
02:22:53,991 --> 02:22:58,440
And then he got submitted by a for Doom 
Vodoun which you and I discussed it.

3028
02:22:58,860 --> 02:23:00,660
This could fucking be doing them for 
him.

3029
02:23:00,770 --> 02:23:01,603
And he's got a nasty a guard.
There's another guy we were talking 

3030
02:23:03,961 --> 02:23:05,370
about yet.
Nasty guard.

3031
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:06,593
Yeah.
So then I saw a couple of pieces of the 

3032
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:13,140
last fight that was fucking 
embarrassing.

3033
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:14,693
That was fucked up.

3034
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:17,160
Both of them.
Fabio,

3035
02:23:17,161 --> 02:23:17,994
I love,
I love his fucking jaw and he takes a 

3036
02:23:19,861 --> 02:23:23,370
fight at short notice and then he fought
that Indian gentlemen before that.

3037
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:24,263
Yeah.
So,

3038
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:25,163
but Fado,
I mean now you just want to exploit the 

3039
02:23:26,611 --> 02:23:29,110
guy and that's how people get hurt.
I don't drink freight.

3040
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:29,953
All wants to fight the people that he 
for fucking years and he was killing 

3041
02:23:32,071 --> 02:23:34,330
people and all of a sudden he didn't 
fight for a while.

3042
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:36,060
Now he wants to make a comeback.
I don't know.

3043
02:23:36,070 --> 02:23:38,580
His brother got out of jail.
His brother just got out of jail.

3044
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,473
Is that true?
Yeah.

3045
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:40,560
Okay.
I did read that.

3046
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:41,603
Ready to fight.
I'm doing pushups and working out in 

3047
02:23:46,441 --> 02:23:47,274
jail.
He's going to come out jacked new 

3048
02:23:48,810 --> 02:23:50,710
tattoos.
I like.

3049
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:51,663
He just wants to fight.
I want them to be able to fight just 

3050
02:23:53,551 --> 02:23:55,320
like I wanted them to be able to fight 
when he was 20.

3051
02:23:55,530 --> 02:23:57,000
I want to deal with the fight when he's 
40,

3052
02:23:57,001 --> 02:24:00,780
if he wants to.
Why not mean he knows that it's not good

3053
02:24:00,781 --> 02:24:01,614
for you?
He knows that the damage that a fighter 

3054
02:24:03,001 --> 02:24:04,050
can take.
He's been beat up.

3055
02:24:04,051 --> 02:24:06,120
He's been stopped.
Dan Henderson knocked them out,

3056
02:24:06,121 --> 02:24:07,740
bigfoot,
knocked him out for doom,

3057
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:08,873
submitted by a triangle.
I mean he's had some goddamn wars and 

3058
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:15,810
some solid is fault.
Not only was he saw it as fuck,

3059
02:24:15,811 --> 02:24:20,460
he was solid as fuck in a division where
people are very rarely solid as fuck.

3060
02:24:20,670 --> 02:24:23,700
Like heavyweight is traditionally like a
division,

3061
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:27,180
at least in the UFC where the title 
changes real quick.

3062
02:24:27,220 --> 02:24:28,053
It's just,
it's too hard to maintain for whatever 

3063
02:24:30,001 --> 02:24:30,834
reason or you know,
up until now it's been but fate or he 

3064
02:24:34,501 --> 02:24:35,334
didn't.
I don't think he lost it anybody for 

3065
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:41,730
more than 10 years and years and he 
fought very good fighters over there.

3066
02:24:41,770 --> 02:24:43,950
He fought very good fighters.
I mean he fought cro,

3067
02:24:43,951 --> 02:24:44,611
cop,
Cro,

3068
02:24:44,611 --> 02:24:45,181
cop,
Cro,

3069
02:24:45,181 --> 02:24:46,014
cop.
You know when cro cop was streaking and 

3070
02:24:48,811 --> 02:24:50,820
he,
he essentially out kickbox Cro,

3071
02:24:50,821 --> 02:24:52,020
cop,
you know what I mean?

3072
02:24:52,021 --> 02:24:52,854
That's what he did in that pride fight.
There was a lot of striking involved in 

3073
02:24:54,991 --> 02:24:59,910
that fight and a fade or one he won that
fight like pretty clearly.

3074
02:24:59,911 --> 02:25:03,360
And again that was when cro cop was in 
his prime and cro.

3075
02:25:03,361 --> 02:25:06,210
Cop had plenty of chances to stand with 
them and he couldn't.

3076
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:10,020
He couldn't get the deal closed.
So there was that fight.

3077
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:10,854
That was a big fight.
Submitting Mark Coleman when Mark 

3078
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:14,960
Coleman was a fucking beast.
That was a big.

3079
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:16,093
That was a big deal.
There's a few fights that were really 

3080
02:25:17,311 --> 02:25:18,144
big deals,
but then there was a fight that didn't 

3081
02:25:19,741 --> 02:25:21,690
happen.
Here's the biggest one though.

3082
02:25:21,691 --> 02:25:23,980
Minataro the Minataro fight.

3083
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:27,400
When Tara was in his prime and fate or 
beat him down,

3084
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:28,473
that is probably is most impressive 
because minotauro back then was fucking 

3085
02:25:33,071 --> 02:25:35,500
scary.
He was really good.

3086
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:40,860
I mean the minute that triangled Mark 
Coleman Minute Toro,

3087
02:25:41,170 --> 02:25:45,520
that was just anybody,
he got a hold of your neck like you were

3088
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:46,920
getting choked out,
you know,

3089
02:25:46,930 --> 02:25:47,763
he was,
he was bringing Jujitsu at a super high 

3090
02:25:50,891 --> 02:25:51,724
level to the heavyweight division.
And the thing about minotauro was he 

3091
02:25:54,791 --> 02:25:56,800
could take a shot.
He could take a shot,

3092
02:25:56,801 --> 02:25:58,530
especially in his prime,
like nobody.

3093
02:25:58,540 --> 02:25:59,720
He was like,
he was like,

3094
02:25:59,730 --> 02:26:00,680
I'm vulnerable.
I go,

3095
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:02,530
he didn't feel pain.
You'd crack him.

3096
02:26:02,710 --> 02:26:04,170
He would take shots.
Then he'd finished you,

3097
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:07,390
you know,
a cro cop beat the shit out of Minotauro

3098
02:26:07,391 --> 02:26:10,540
for one round.
I mean beat the shit out of him and then

3099
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:12,970
he had kicked them at the end of the 
first round,

3100
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:16,930
like boom and minute.
Tarell thought they stopped the fight,

3101
02:26:16,931 --> 02:26:18,190
but it was actually the end of the 
round.

3102
02:26:18,370 --> 02:26:19,850
He thought they stopped the fight with 
the referee.

3103
02:26:19,851 --> 02:26:21,210
So that was like,
no,

3104
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:23,200
no,
like you're not going to stop this.

3105
02:26:23,490 --> 02:26:24,011
And the guy goes,
no,

3106
02:26:24,011 --> 02:26:24,380
no,
no.

3107
02:26:24,380 --> 02:26:25,510
Just the end of the eyes like,
okay,

3108
02:26:25,511 --> 02:26:28,360
good segue around.
Starts shoots in,

3109
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,710
takes Cro,
cop down,

3110
02:26:29,810 --> 02:26:30,750
armbars him.

3111
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:36,040
He was just so tough.
Fade or beat him down,

3112
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:36,874
man.
Fatal heart.

3113
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:39,430
Beat him down and it was a scary beat 
down.

3114
02:26:39,431 --> 02:26:40,264
Like he had been a when the corner and 
he was ground and pounding them with 

3115
02:26:43,901 --> 02:26:48,160
these for Roche's.
Those casting punches that fade orthros.

3116
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:50,770
He's not punching like this,
like straight.

3117
02:26:50,980 --> 02:26:51,813
He's throwing these crazy like circular 
hammers that are going around your 

3118
02:26:56,651 --> 02:26:57,484
gloves,
like you're holding your gloves up in 

3119
02:26:59,351 --> 02:27:00,184
front of yourself,
trying to defend yourself and he's 

3120
02:27:01,571 --> 02:27:02,404
thrown these whipping punches that are 
going behind the gloves and smashing 

3121
02:27:06,281 --> 02:27:07,580
Minataro his face.
I was.

3122
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:11,050
It was one of the worst beat downs you 
ever saw.

3123
02:27:11,051 --> 02:27:16,030
A ground and pound and pride like 
trapped in a corner because he just.

3124
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:17,103
He just worked a man.
He didn't put some ferocious punches 

3125
02:27:18,701 --> 02:27:19,900
then.
Not a lot of people would have been able

3126
02:27:19,901 --> 02:27:21,490
to take.
He broke his cheekbone.

3127
02:27:22,410 --> 02:27:23,680
He hit him with some bombs,
man,

3128
02:27:24,310 --> 02:27:25,143
but that was when Fado was fader.
So if you look at that fight with 

3129
02:27:28,721 --> 02:27:31,260
Minataro,
you look at that fight with cro cop like

3130
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:34,300
some of his best performances.
There's no doubt he's,

3131
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:38,020
if he's not the greatest,
it's between him and Cain Velasquez,

3132
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:38,883
in my opinion,
as far as the two greatest heavyweights 

3133
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:41,133
of all time.
And then honorable consideration to 

3134
02:27:44,110 --> 02:27:49,030
fabrizio verdon like fabrice overdoing.
Despite getting killed with one punch by

3135
02:27:49,031 --> 02:27:49,864
steep meo chick still submitted.
Cain Velasquez submitted Minataro and 

3136
02:27:53,771 --> 02:27:57,130
submitted fader.
He submitted three all time greats.

3137
02:27:57,310 --> 02:27:58,143
So those are the three that I think you 
have to take into consideration is the 

3138
02:28:00,611 --> 02:28:01,444
greatest of all time.
The only thing that you would look and 

3139
02:28:03,851 --> 02:28:05,950
you'd say,
well more people.

3140
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:08,410
Uh,
like how many people beat each guy,

3141
02:28:08,650 --> 02:28:09,483
you know,
how many people beat Minotauro versus 

3142
02:28:10,691 --> 02:28:13,790
how many people beat fade or versus how 
many people became.

3143
02:28:13,790 --> 02:28:17,020
And Kenny count all that up.
Who knows?

3144
02:28:17,270 --> 02:28:18,210
It's,
you know,

3145
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:20,020
it's hard.
It doesn't really make sense.

3146
02:28:20,050 --> 02:28:21,980
Like trying to figure out who's the 
greatest of all time,

3147
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,190
who gives a fuck.
But if it is a moral new guy comes along

3148
02:28:25,191 --> 02:28:27,050
and we've been waiting some time for 20 
minutes.

3149
02:28:27,230 --> 02:28:30,370
The thing about fate or those that he 
did it for so long.

3150
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:32,660
No,
he did it for the longest time when I,

3151
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:34,790
I tapped into them,
like I said,

3152
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:40,300
towards the end and when he lost,
he got the arm bar from reduce was like,

3153
02:28:40,761 --> 02:28:41,594
I wasn't surprised,
like you could see the deterioration 

3154
02:28:44,690 --> 02:28:45,523
they were trying to explore them at that
time with the UFC that were asking for 

3155
02:28:49,521 --> 02:28:50,354
money.
They know what they want to do with 

3156
02:28:51,201 --> 02:28:53,240
them.
It was like they knew something.

3157
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:57,950
You're following me.
It's like when that team calls you up,

3158
02:28:57,951 --> 02:29:02,540
when they try to give you the home run 
fucking champion or the last eight years

3159
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:05,120
miraculously on a Tuesday,
you know what I'm saying?

3160
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:05,953
Like why do I deserve this fucking call?
They knew something and he started 

3161
02:29:09,591 --> 02:29:12,050
losing a couple of fights and they 
retired shortly after.

3162
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:13,370
Well,
he lost three in a row.

3163
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:15,290
It's really crazy.
Which was crazy.

3164
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:19,070
And the first one he loses by 
submission,

3165
02:29:19,670 --> 02:29:21,860
you know,
but it was a mistake.

3166
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:24,650
He followed her doomed to the ground.
He hit him,

3167
02:29:24,651 --> 02:29:26,910
he had him hurt.
He thought he had him hurt him,

3168
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:29,570
just set a trap,
locked them up tight,

3169
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:32,690
gotten with that nasty yard.
But the second one was bad.

3170
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:33,733
Second one,
he fought big foot and that was one big 

3171
02:29:35,691 --> 02:29:36,524
foot was big foot.
That's been big for us on that 

3172
02:29:37,881 --> 02:29:38,714
testosterone to they,
that's when they allowed them to do it 

3173
02:29:40,761 --> 02:29:43,070
because you know,
bigfoot had a pituitary gland tumor,

3174
02:29:43,130 --> 02:29:43,963
so he had like legitimate gigantism and 
he's a guy who actually needed 

3175
02:29:46,491 --> 02:29:49,610
testosterone.
He really did need it and it was,

3176
02:29:51,250 --> 02:29:55,460
and a door,
it was just boom,

3177
02:29:55,461 --> 02:29:56,570
boom,
boom.

3178
02:29:56,570 --> 02:29:57,403
He stopped them and you know,
people forget that big foot despite the 

3179
02:30:01,611 --> 02:30:05,060
fact that he's an enormous guy or I'm 
not just despite rather,

3180
02:30:05,061 --> 02:30:07,040
but uh,
as well as being an enormous guy,

3181
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:09,530
he's also a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black 
belt.

3182
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:11,600
Like legit.
That guy mounts you,

3183
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:12,434
you're fucked.
It's a 300 pound giant person mounted 

3184
02:30:16,371 --> 02:30:17,204
you with black belt skills and he's 
dropping these fucking laptops on your 

3185
02:30:20,841 --> 02:30:21,740
head.
Boom,

3186
02:30:22,170 --> 02:30:24,860
boom.
Yeah,

3187
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:28,010
fuck that.
So that was a bad beating.

3188
02:30:28,340 --> 02:30:33,340
And then Henderson Kod and the Henderson
one was Henderson's and 185 pounds,

3189
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:36,470
which is even crazier.
So he went from a 300 pound man,

3190
02:30:36,471 --> 02:30:39,470
k,
l and M to 185 pound man k on them.

3191
02:30:39,590 --> 02:30:42,290
And by the way,
Henderson not a big one.

3192
02:30:42,291 --> 02:30:45,480
80 five like Henderson's.
Not as big as some guys that have fought

3193
02:30:45,481 --> 02:30:46,314
and one 70.
That's how hard he fucking punches and 

3194
02:30:49,410 --> 02:30:50,243
listens.
Tiny.

3195
02:30:51,230 --> 02:30:54,110
I wouldn't say that to his face.
I thought he was tiny,

3196
02:30:54,111 --> 02:30:54,681
tiny,
tiny.

3197
02:30:54,681 --> 02:30:56,330
But he listen man,
you know,

3198
02:30:56,331 --> 02:30:57,590
you watch pro football,
right?

3199
02:30:57,890 --> 02:30:58,723
You look at those defensive backs and 
also you see him after the game and 

3200
02:31:01,731 --> 02:31:04,320
you're like back,
I hate that fucking big way.

3201
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:07,490
He's hitting,
he's lightened people up.

3202
02:31:07,491 --> 02:31:08,510
But he's five,
nine,

3203
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:09,790
one 85.
The momentum's.

3204
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:10,633
Wait,
you're right.

3205
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:14,060
That's a perfect size for all that sharp
dig is Otros Cinco.

3206
02:31:14,690 --> 02:31:16,200
Check it out.
You.

3207
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:17,653
Yeah.
You were just saying I'll look them up 

3208
02:31:19,201 --> 02:31:20,090
as a fisherman.
I guess

3209
02:31:20,090 --> 02:31:20,461
six.
One,

3210
02:31:20,461 --> 02:31:25,080
one 85.
That seems like to be at your fastest.

3211
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:27,780
Seems like that's a good weight for 
those guys,

3212
02:31:27,781 --> 02:31:29,730
right?
Pulling 95,

3213
02:31:29,731 --> 02:31:30,091
two,
two.

3214
02:31:30,091 --> 02:31:32,190
Oh,
five one.

3215
02:31:32,191 --> 02:31:34,020
80 five.
You know,

3216
02:31:34,021 --> 02:31:37,530
if you're a good defensive back,
you're one 85,

3217
02:31:37,531 --> 02:31:40,710
you're banging up against my.
So what do you think?

3218
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:44,430
Like the lightest guy that plays in the 
nfl ways.

3219
02:31:44,670 --> 02:31:47,640
What's a super light guy?
One slash 75 with a DB.

3220
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:49,350
Wow.
Let's check it.

3221
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:50,193
I,
I gotta listen to this fucking there's 

3222
02:31:52,321 --> 02:31:56,400
fucking receive is that'll pick you up 
and throw you out of the stadium.

3223
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:59,060
They got Thai.
Then instead of fucking six,

3224
02:31:59,110 --> 02:32:02,390
60 to 65 and they got,
you know,

3225
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:04,920
what's the,
what's the shit they say to people like,

3226
02:32:04,921 --> 02:32:08,670
you know,
when they break up the 1:55,

3227
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:10,980
look at this guy.
Oh my God,

3228
02:32:10,981 --> 02:32:13,140
what's the top at one?
19.

3229
02:32:13,141 --> 02:32:13,974
What's that?
That backup a little their backup so we 

3230
02:32:16,141 --> 02:32:19,110
could see better.
It was from another story or didn't have

3231
02:32:19,111 --> 02:32:20,160
the whole thing.
Oh I see,

3232
02:32:20,161 --> 02:32:21,710
I see.
Huh.

3233
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:22,950
But he's a receiver.

3234
02:32:24,550 --> 02:32:27,520
So one guy said he was one guy weighed 
155 pounds.

3235
02:32:27,550 --> 02:32:29,290
Was that recent or is that back in the 
day?

3236
02:32:29,310 --> 02:32:30,580
It was a current player.
That guy.

3237
02:32:31,290 --> 02:32:33,430
But let me tell you something about that
1:55.

3238
02:32:33,790 --> 02:32:37,450
That 1:55
is running fucking right.

3239
02:32:37,451 --> 02:32:38,284
Passion.
Probably I could bet my life that they 

3240
02:32:40,391 --> 02:32:41,224
let him play at 1:55.
It's because either he's going to come 

3241
02:32:44,291 --> 02:32:45,124
in one,
play a game and just do a for fucking 

3242
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:50,320
four for three.
Yeah,

3243
02:32:50,530 --> 02:32:52,000
there you go.
I don't have to tell you.

3244
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:55,840
It's all the same shit.
That guy has to come in,

3245
02:32:56,260 --> 02:33:00,640
but if he gets hit he ain't get mad.
Don't get caught from behind.

3246
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:04,540
If anything they like grabbed his leg.
The guy's gonna die like Pete rose.

3247
02:33:05,090 --> 02:33:06,910
Grab his leg there.
You ain't going to hit him.

3248
02:33:07,810 --> 02:33:09,250
It's just him doing drills.
Jamie,

3249
02:33:12,070 --> 02:33:13,360
you know,
what is he doing?

3250
02:33:15,070 --> 02:33:15,903
I want to say it.

3251
02:33:18,270 --> 02:33:21,720
Let's say a guy running for president.
Unless you're there,

3252
02:33:22,110 --> 02:33:25,140
I think there's something lost in a 
video of a guy running.

3253
02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:26,063
You know,
what is it like you ever see a guy like 

3254
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:29,613
work out live and super impressed,
but you see it in a video and you're 

3255
02:33:33,601 --> 02:33:34,290
like,
oh,

3256
02:33:34,290 --> 02:33:38,310
not that big a deal.
It's hard to move the ball back.

3257
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:39,640
Yeah,
that's what they do.

3258
02:33:39,641 --> 02:33:44,641
And that's what I told you.
God for that Holy Shit.

3259
02:33:46,390 --> 02:33:51,390
Like lightning 56 is pretty fast from.
So Holy Shit.

3260
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:55,110
Wow.
Well,

3261
02:33:55,111 --> 02:33:57,870
hey,
that's being 160 pounds.

3262
02:33:57,871 --> 02:33:59,430
Why he got them?
Watch this one.

3263
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:00,150
Nope.
No,

3264
02:34:00,150 --> 02:34:01,990
this guy,
they said one 65.

3265
02:34:01,991 --> 02:34:03,540
So what they said Jamie is a different 
guy.

3266
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:07,660
Oh look at that.
I think I've tried to hit them.

3267
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:10,140
They've tried to grab his leg.
Oh my God,

3268
02:34:10,141 --> 02:34:13,560
he's so fast.
That's hilarious.

3269
02:34:14,130 --> 02:34:14,963
Holy Shit.
He's like a ghost like to dive in in 

3270
02:34:16,861 --> 02:34:18,190
front of them.
Look at this,

3271
02:34:18,490 --> 02:34:21,240
look at this shit.
Oh my God.

3272
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:23,770
Best running back in college football 
right now.

3273
02:34:23,771 --> 02:34:26,140
It's about his size.
He was a little bit bigger than 1:55,

3274
02:34:26,141 --> 02:34:29,240
but he's five slash seven,
like one slash 75 and he's got no,

3275
02:34:29,241 --> 02:34:31,620
he can't be stopped or stopped because 
they can't see him.

3276
02:34:31,690 --> 02:34:33,190
What happened to that white dude right 
there.

3277
02:34:33,191 --> 02:34:35,470
Back that up just a couple seconds ago.
I mean,

3278
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:39,220
obviously I'm not a fucking commentary a
little bit for before that.

3279
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:42,160
Before that.
Watch this guy.

3280
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:44,500
Watch this white dude that's waiting 
down there.

3281
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:46,420
Watch this.
Don't do anything.

3282
02:34:46,421 --> 02:34:47,254
He's the punter.
He is.

3283
02:34:47,730 --> 02:34:49,250
He can't take them out if you're the 
punter.

3284
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:51,250
He's about.
Hold on.

3285
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:54,363
Some part is don't give a fuck Jack.
They had a couple of cocktails before 

3286
02:34:57,371 --> 02:34:58,204
the game.
They'll throw that shoulder in the but 

3287
02:34:59,411 --> 02:35:01,480
that's all you're going to get out of 
them as a good shoulder.

3288
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:04,490
That guy just stood there,
so show that again.

3289
02:35:04,730 --> 02:35:08,240
That guy just stood there in front of 
them and like fake them out.

3290
02:35:08,300 --> 02:35:11,240
Watch like he's running.
I was trying to steer him out of bounds,

3291
02:35:11,241 --> 02:35:12,470
but he can.
He can't tackle.

3292
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:14,300
He doesn't practice to.
Can't tackle him.

3293
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:18,750
He allowed like prop them up.
Well,

3294
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:20,450
I don't have pads on.
Don't hit me.

3295
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:23,053
Does the punter where the same pads?
Not usually because they have to kick 

3296
02:35:26,511 --> 02:35:29,170
their leg up higher and they stuff on 
Dev.

3297
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:31,790
A smaller helmet to less protection.
Wow.

3298
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,030
You really can't.
Weird.

3299
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:34,770
You can't kick.
You can't touch the pump.

3300
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:35,613
It's a violation.
So he's not going to be padded up until 

3301
02:35:37,661 --> 02:35:38,850
the gazelles.
Right?

3302
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:41,060
I get it,
but he could still trip this motherfuck.

3303
02:35:41,061 --> 02:35:43,720
I mean you get candies allowed to get in
300 g's a year.

3304
02:35:43,721 --> 02:35:45,170
You got to do something.
Do something.

3305
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:48,190
Just kicked the ball into his hand.
He ran it back.

3306
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:50,140
If he runs back to you,
you fucked up.

3307
02:35:50,250 --> 02:35:52,420
You fucked up.
You fucked up somewhere.

3308
02:35:52,690 --> 02:35:54,220
You put it in this range.
Trip him.

3309
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:57,010
He see the punter.
What you want to do is.

3310
02:35:57,310 --> 02:36:01,030
Let's go to the fucking video tape here.
This is the scoreboard right here,

3311
02:36:01,031 --> 02:36:01,701
right?
Joe Rogan,

3312
02:36:01,701 --> 02:36:04,630
and this is the field.
If I'm a punk them my job is.

3313
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,670
You see what that 60 yard line is?

3314
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:09,430
Watches the punter punting,
hundred and 50 pounds.

3315
02:36:10,690 --> 02:36:12,700
That's the part that I just check that 
dude.

3316
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,220
Ninety nine.
Why that?

3317
02:36:14,221 --> 02:36:17,050
I think I get mad at them.
Elbow of them are.

3318
02:36:17,051 --> 02:36:18,460
They're excited.
They're happy.

3319
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:19,413
Like you funny.
Like it was my daughters would think is 

3320
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:24,520
an aggressive,
you know,

3321
02:36:24,521 --> 02:36:28,000
like don't fucking hit me with guys 
after they're playing football.

3322
02:36:28,001 --> 02:36:29,610
That's a good thing.
Booms.

3323
02:36:29,611 --> 02:36:31,150
He watched this other guy runs into 
them.

3324
02:36:31,151 --> 02:36:32,610
You Washes?
Yeah.

3325
02:36:32,650 --> 02:36:36,190
Motherfucker like he's excited.
He likes double poms.

3326
02:36:36,191 --> 02:36:38,590
I'm on his chest,
but that's it because he likes him.

3327
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:43,480
So Joe Rogan,
he wants to have the boy here right when

3328
02:36:43,481 --> 02:36:45,440
I'm paying you.
I don't want to.

3329
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:46,990
Borderlands in here.
Yeah.

3330
02:36:46,991 --> 02:36:48,870
He's going to get momentum from here.
Right?

3331
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:53,320
I want the borderlands always on the six
yard line right here.

3332
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:56,310
This is why I want the ball on the end 
territory.

3333
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:58,300
Right?
Because I got more support.

3334
02:36:58,390 --> 02:37:00,970
I could get them from the inside.
This motherfucker kicked it here.

3335
02:37:01,270 --> 02:37:05,140
He's fucking doing a fight.
He's five foot 880 pound weight thing is

3336
02:37:05,141 --> 02:37:06,240
going to do.
Right,

3337
02:37:06,241 --> 02:37:08,230
so you kick a ball,
throw a guy right there,

3338
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:10,300
you put it right there for him.
He should be shot on.

3339
02:37:11,150 --> 02:37:14,140
You should at least recovering tackle 
them or buy them or do something.

3340
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:16,280
Yeah,
already fucked up with the punter

3341
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:17,510
already.
He fucked up.

3342
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:21,090
You want to put that ball where he's 
going to have the most out.

3343
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:22,243
Let me ask you this.
When you're talking about baseball and 

3344
02:37:24,651 --> 02:37:25,484
all the pete rose stuff,
you can run into dudes anymore and you 

3345
02:37:28,341 --> 02:37:30,380
know you're seeing like the softening of
society.

3346
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:34,970
How are they going to soften up football
they have.

3347
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:40,030
You can't be an and no more like can you
go on to still pretty fucking brutal,

3348
02:37:40,310 --> 02:37:42,110
right?
The raiders,

3349
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:43,213
you remember because at this time you 
were a kid and people talked about the 

3350
02:37:45,651 --> 02:37:48,050
raiders.
Had a reputation is bad motherfuckers.

3351
02:37:48,051 --> 02:37:52,040
I mean one of their guys crippled the 
dude on Monday night football.

3352
02:37:52,820 --> 02:37:57,080
Jack Tatum fucking crippled the guy with
a hit home at first.

3353
02:37:57,140 --> 02:37:58,250
You know,
until the spine.

3354
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:00,170
That's.
Did he do it on purpose?

3355
02:38:00,171 --> 02:38:01,004
I don't think so,
but that's the reputation you have is 

3356
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:06,350
that reputation has grown,
you know,

3357
02:38:06,351 --> 02:38:09,560
with all the Mattoon,
Zach's and all those crazy motherfuckers

3358
02:38:10,010 --> 02:38:12,490
hit themselves in the head with helmets 
and Oh shit.

3359
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:15,650
Does it sell tickets itself?
Tickets.

3360
02:38:15,651 --> 02:38:17,420
I mean now with all the show,
often,

3361
02:38:17,560 --> 02:38:20,150
I don't know.
It takes away.

3362
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:23,063
I don't need to see a guy on his back,
bro with his parents and home on their 

3363
02:38:25,951 --> 02:38:26,784
feet watching this on tv thing and his 
body shaking because he just jolted his 

3364
02:38:30,901 --> 02:38:32,840
neck.
I think that shit too.

3365
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:34,203
Well,
I have a friend who went to a high 

3366
02:38:35,331 --> 02:38:39,660
school game recently and he said,
I think he said five,

3367
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:42,300
five kids got laid out in a high school 
game.

3368
02:38:44,110 --> 02:38:46,740
He said they just cracked into each 
other and you know,

3369
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:47,673
seeing as kids lying on the ground with 
their Bell Rung City saw it five 

3370
02:38:50,801 --> 02:38:53,030
different times.
He might have said six man,

3371
02:38:53,031 --> 02:38:53,950
I'm,
I'm trying to remember,

3372
02:38:54,130 --> 02:38:55,810
but he was shocked.
Oh my God,

3373
02:38:56,110 --> 02:38:58,450
those two guys.
Oh my God.

3374
02:38:59,020 --> 02:39:00,940
They double smash into this dude,
look at this.

3375
02:39:00,941 --> 02:39:02,800
He gets the ball.
Boom,

3376
02:39:03,070 --> 02:39:04,060
boom.
Oh,

3377
02:39:04,110 --> 02:39:06,460
that guy's going home for a couple of 
weeks.

3378
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:10,510
It went back like that.
That's horrible.

3379
02:39:11,610 --> 02:39:12,950
Is that him?
No,

3380
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:15,030
it's another guy.
It's like the top 10.

3381
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:16,380
Oh,
highlight thing.

3382
02:39:16,381 --> 02:39:17,670
I was just putting it up.
I as you're talking.

3383
02:39:17,700 --> 02:39:20,400
I thought they're showing them smiling 
afterwards like we're okay.

3384
02:39:20,550 --> 02:39:23,140
Everything's fine.
You fucking on that play.

3385
02:39:23,290 --> 02:39:25,730
Yeah.
You imagine your home.

3386
02:39:25,740 --> 02:39:28,520
It goes back that are looking at these 
potential.

3387
02:39:28,570 --> 02:39:30,300
Is that a fine?
Is that a violation?

3388
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:32,160
Jamie's going to be a.
because he led with his elbow.

3389
02:39:32,161 --> 02:39:34,410
He knocked him out.
Oh Shit.

3390
02:39:34,411 --> 02:39:37,140
On the replay here.
He's the guy that dove into them because

3391
02:39:37,141 --> 02:39:37,974
when the quarterback slides like that,
joe that aren't allowed to hit them at 

3392
02:39:39,631 --> 02:39:41,040
all,
they're giving up their body,

3393
02:39:41,700 --> 02:39:42,950
so not allowed to be touched.
Basically.

3394
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:43,813
Out All you gotta let them just hit the 
ground and he was already flying in and 

3395
02:39:45,391 --> 02:39:47,310
hit him with the elbow,
which also hit him in the head.

3396
02:39:47,730 --> 02:39:49,710
Say Probably.
He probably got fined 25,

3397
02:39:49,711 --> 02:39:50,940
30,000
bucks for this.

3398
02:39:52,750 --> 02:39:54,070
Wait a minute,
hold on.

3399
02:39:54,071 --> 02:39:55,810
Do that again.
Let me say this again.

3400
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:57,430
The car,
he's,

3401
02:39:57,430 --> 02:39:59,900
since he's sliding feet first you got,
you don't even touch them.

3402
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:01,760
You're supposed to just let up,
but he's.

3403
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:04,880
He's already in a position where you 
can't stop to it.

3404
02:40:04,890 --> 02:40:07,180
Too Bad.
You got to have better control you.

3405
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:08,870
That's what they say.
You just kind of better control.

3406
02:40:08,980 --> 02:40:09,813
But what do you think?
I'm looking at this and it didn't look 

3407
02:40:11,661 --> 02:40:13,800
intentional to me.
I mean elite.

3408
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:16,050
You could definitely argue that it's not
intentional.

3409
02:40:16,350 --> 02:40:21,210
I mean it seems like the guy is sliding 
and he's on top of him already.

3410
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:24,900
He's got to kind of roll with it.
Do you think he knew that he was hitting

3411
02:40:24,901 --> 02:40:27,230
him in the face now?
One,

3412
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:29,850
we were just literally just talking 
about that specific one here.

3413
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:32,640
You can see him throughout his elbow,
so it looks like he's doing a little bit

3414
02:40:32,641 --> 02:40:34,850
extra with the elbow,
but then they also,

3415
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:37,820
they'll get into arbitration things like
they also do with some of the MMA thing.

3416
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:40,350
They'll have a lawyers argue some of 
this stuff out.

3417
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:41,333
So what happened with that Tom Brady 
situation at drug out for two years and 

3418
02:40:44,220 --> 02:40:45,960
they finally just took us four game 
suspension.

3419
02:40:46,300 --> 02:40:47,250
See,
I don't know man.

3420
02:40:47,251 --> 02:40:48,080
It's hard to say.

3421
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:49,990
Now.
The problem we're having is Joe Rogan is

3422
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:50,421
said,
okay,

3423
02:40:50,421 --> 02:40:51,254
I go back and I look at my high school.
I looked at the kids I grew up in those 

3424
02:40:54,561 --> 02:40:56,780
four years.
I knew how they practiced.

3425
02:40:57,230 --> 02:41:00,380
I knew how they worked out and I knew 
how they hit each other.

3426
02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:03,380
Okay.
And then some of them went on to college

3427
02:41:03,381 --> 02:41:07,520
and did what the fuck they had to do.
Are they any of them fucked up today?

3428
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:10,660
Oh yeah.
What a troll.

3429
02:41:12,410 --> 02:41:14,390
That dude head to head Kale.
That guy.

3430
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:15,273
What?
You know why five kids went on to your 

3431
02:41:16,401 --> 02:41:17,440
friend's high school,
man.

3432
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:19,860
You know why?
Why?

3433
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:21,580
Because Oh,
Jesus.

3434
02:41:21,630 --> 02:41:22,463
Now were bread and butter in them.
And then show that one again and then 

3435
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:27,440
not used to get mad.
No more were bread and butter.

3436
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:29,640
What do you mean?
We'll put down to that.

3437
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:31,920
So he was at practice with just going 
like this now,

3438
02:41:32,700 --> 02:41:33,533
which is going like this.
It's like when you and I go to a karate 

3439
02:41:37,231 --> 02:41:40,140
competition and it's a

3440
02:41:40,910 --> 02:41:41,970
Oh,
oh,

3441
02:41:42,930 --> 02:41:44,430
oh my God,
this is horrible.

3442
02:41:44,431 --> 02:41:47,170
This one's horrible.
Boom,

3443
02:41:47,240 --> 02:41:49,950
look like his body goes backwards.
He's unconscious.

3444
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:52,050
Oh my God.

3445
02:41:55,530 --> 02:41:56,670
Boom.
Has had.

3446
02:41:56,730 --> 02:41:57,870
Oh,
when the helmet goes off,

3447
02:41:57,871 --> 02:42:00,410
you know you're fucked.
That's visions.

3448
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:02,370
That's Japanese people yelling at the 
night.

3449
02:42:03,480 --> 02:42:07,620
That's what you hear in the middle man 
out cold.

3450
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:10,860
You need to be a parent watching this on
TV at any level.

3451
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:15,540
No.
He's snoring out cold.

3452
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:16,840
That is.
Look at this.

3453
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:19,230
Could do all my

3454
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:22,480
God.
He took it to the temple sideways.

3455
02:42:22,810 --> 02:42:23,920
Head to head.
Now,

3456
02:42:23,921 --> 02:42:25,450
that kind of shit.
Is that on purpose?

3457
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:27,770
That's ahead.
That's flipped out.

3458
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:28,181
He went,
yeah,

3459
02:42:28,181 --> 02:42:29,170
that was the shoulder.
That's.

3460
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:31,320
That's kind of what you're taught.
That's what you're taught to do.

3461
02:42:31,321 --> 02:42:34,770
So just part of the consequences of 
ball.

3462
02:42:34,810 --> 02:42:36,780
Big giant guys running around his 
shoulders.

3463
02:42:36,790 --> 02:42:37,623
It hit him.

3464
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,550
So I thought it was heading to work at 
his waist.

3465
02:42:39,551 --> 02:42:42,670
Joe Romm back.
Look how everything twisted.

3466
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:46,060
It's not just a head contact,
it's that spine contact.

3467
02:42:46,061 --> 02:42:48,980
That's what makes altogether.
You just see a fucking bolt.

3468
02:42:48,981 --> 02:42:51,010
The lightening and Shit,
look at that spine.

3469
02:42:51,011 --> 02:42:54,250
Can his whole thing twisted?
That's why he put his arms up.

3470
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:55,653
Is that the guy that got knocked out 
that was sitting there with the 

3471
02:42:56,830 --> 02:42:57,590
dreadlocks?

3472
02:42:57,590 --> 02:42:59,500
No,
they were shitty editing this video.

3473
02:42:59,501 --> 02:43:01,750
They fucked with me twice.
I was going to show you next.

3474
02:43:01,810 --> 02:43:02,643
This is what the.
The alternative to this is right now is 

3475
02:43:04,810 --> 02:43:05,643
there's some tackle non tackle nonpaid 
leagues and so there's seven on seven 

3476
02:43:09,911 --> 02:43:11,020
us.
There's less guys running.

3477
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:12,040
I don't

3478
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:13,720
know that anybody wants to pay to watch 
this though.

3479
02:43:13,721 --> 02:43:16,660
This is the problem.
Well,

3480
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:22,320
the idea is to be that haven't pads was 
good for you and have it helmets is good

3481
02:43:23,561 --> 02:43:24,394
for you,
but now they're thinking that it's not 

3482
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:26,673
in that you're going to do things like 
that where you wouldn't do those kinds 

3483
02:43:28,781 --> 02:43:29,614
of things.
Going back to your fucking brain 

3484
02:43:32,411 --> 02:43:33,244
argument brain,
if the brain doubled in 2 million years 

3485
02:43:37,901 --> 02:43:39,010
or whatever,
the fucking thing.

3486
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:40,293
Our strength also doubled.
The things that we're able to do with 

3487
02:43:42,741 --> 02:43:45,040
our bodies also doubled.
Okay,

3488
02:43:45,041 --> 02:43:46,690
and even though you're a welcomed 
addition,

3489
02:43:46,691 --> 02:43:48,350
football pain,
you're prepared for him.

3490
02:43:48,351 --> 02:43:49,184
It's like this.
You're not prepared for me if I'm 

3491
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:52,113
fucking dead lifting 70 slash 50 and I'm
doing certain exercises to make my hits 

3492
02:43:57,790 --> 02:43:58,623
even better because there's some guy 
like the guys we talk about like the 

3493
02:44:01,691 --> 02:44:02,110
trainers is.

3494
02:44:02,110 --> 02:44:02,943
We talk about the working on specific 
movements like they worked on specific 

3495
02:44:06,071 --> 02:44:06,904
movements or have ema.
We were talking about like joy Alvarado 

3496
02:44:09,071 --> 02:44:10,520
works on the,
the,

3497
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:13,630
the Turkish getup.
Well that's people man.

3498
02:44:13,631 --> 02:44:15,240
When football that I've said,
you know what,

3499
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:19,870
I've been watching football for 20 years
and this is the workout I'm implying and

3500
02:44:19,871 --> 02:44:23,460
this makes a guy like you at 20 fucking 
22 years,

3501
02:44:23,490 --> 02:44:27,130
the strongest you've ever been.
Twenty four years out of college.

3502
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:29,860
You're bench pressing 3:50
3:50.

3503
02:44:29,861 --> 02:44:30,694
Even if you're fucking one 85,
you're bench pressing now in highschool 

3504
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:36,400
3:25.
It's not what it used to be.

3505
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:39,080
80 five,
the national average of this.

3506
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:42,670
Go ahead and look at the results of 
these combines 20 years ago,

3507
02:44:42,970 --> 02:44:45,280
30 years ago,
and what these kids are doing now.

3508
02:44:45,281 --> 02:44:47,060
Speed wise,
strength wise,

3509
02:44:47,230 --> 02:44:48,063
flexibility wise.
So there's a guy that has broken down 

3510
02:44:51,250 --> 02:44:53,410
the kinesiology of a football hit.

3511
02:44:53,470 --> 02:44:56,050
Okay,
and then maybe put it in a workout.

3512
02:44:56,350 --> 02:44:59,220
I'm hitting you double than what I used 
to hit you all.

3513
02:45:00,460 --> 02:45:03,700
Nine hundred and 30 pound squat by a 
Texas high school junior.

3514
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:07,300
This is what I'm talking about.
That's a junior in high school.

3515
02:45:07,330 --> 02:45:12,330
They've improved form.
They've improved seven foot 440 pounds.

3516
02:45:13,350 --> 02:45:14,580
Okay.
You know,

3517
02:45:15,610 --> 02:45:16,443
grow big and okay.
Fifty years ago or seven foot guy 

3518
02:45:20,051 --> 02:45:22,480
couldn't walk around.
Okay.

3519
02:45:22,510 --> 02:45:23,343
Now he's playing basketball.
He's adjunct for years or seven foot 

3520
02:45:26,951 --> 02:45:28,550
guy.
Couldn't put weight on there.

3521
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:30,070
That fucking kid.
Look at this.

3522
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:32,980
The biggest football player we've ever 
seen.

3523
02:45:33,220 --> 02:45:35,920
Wow.
He's in high school.

3524
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:38,320
He's gone.
Yeah.

3525
02:45:38,670 --> 02:45:40,750
That bringing them cars already.
Oh yeah.

3526
02:45:40,751 --> 02:45:41,584
His bitches.
That bringing them women in a car trunk 

3527
02:45:45,221 --> 02:45:46,054
prepared already.
We guys are going to shoot them and put 

3528
02:45:47,921 --> 02:45:49,330
them in the trunk and say,
we'll see.

3529
02:45:49,331 --> 02:45:50,164
I'm bringing him.
Young tech has to be the mountain for 

3530
02:45:51,731 --> 02:45:52,564
Halloween,
right?

3531
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:54,340
No.
Why would you be anything else?

3532
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:55,413
I would have fucking armor.
Just different different outfits at the 

3533
02:45:57,671 --> 02:45:59,030
mountain.
Where's done?

3534
02:45:59,110 --> 02:46:01,840
Just like the brain has grown.
We've gotten stronger.

3535
02:46:02,710 --> 02:46:04,340
We've gotten way stronger.
Our,

3536
02:46:04,550 --> 02:46:09,550
our workouts were particular things have
gotten more on that.

3537
02:46:09,750 --> 02:46:10,040
Was that

3538
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,873
what you want pinpoint for what you're 
doing or what exercise will they 

3539
02:46:13,431 --> 02:46:15,720
understand what's beneficial and what's 
so?

3540
02:46:15,770 --> 02:46:20,330
They also understand when you're 
recovering epogen and guess what?

3541
02:46:20,331 --> 02:46:22,140
In 20 years we're going to be hitting 
even auto.

3542
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:24,590
You're going to see jaws flying right 
off the fucking face.

3543
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:26,213
Some MMA fight.
You're going to see a George just snap 

3544
02:46:28,551 --> 02:46:29,384
open to the whole of the side of some of
these that somebody is going to be 

3545
02:46:31,791 --> 02:46:33,860
hitting that much fucking harder.
You know,

3546
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:35,120
30 years ago,
look at this,

3547
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:37,850
you know,
they were hitting in the seventies,

3548
02:46:38,660 --> 02:46:40,810
but.
Well,

3549
02:46:40,990 --> 02:46:41,823
it's interesting to me is when you start
talking about the brain getting bigger 

3550
02:46:44,871 --> 02:46:47,310
and bodies faster,
kill him.

3551
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:50,660
That dude was a killer.
There was accounting straight up.

3552
02:46:50,870 --> 02:46:51,703
What's interesting to me about these 
athletes getting better and faster and 

3553
02:46:54,411 --> 02:46:55,244
stronger and brain's getting bigger.
It's a wonder what it's going to be 

3554
02:46:58,251 --> 02:46:58,880
like.

3555
02:46:58,880 --> 02:46:59,713
You know,
they talk about the human brain doubled 

3556
02:47:00,651 --> 02:47:03,950
over 2 million years.
Why would we assume that that stopped?

3557
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:05,990
You know,
maybe it's just a long,

3558
02:47:05,991 --> 02:47:09,110
long,
long process of brain getting bigger,

3559
02:47:09,111 --> 02:47:09,944
people getting bigger,
people getting strong or people getting 

3560
02:47:11,451 --> 02:47:12,284
faster.
Like what's the performance of a person 

3561
02:47:13,821 --> 02:47:15,430
that don't look like if it's increased 
that much.

3562
02:47:15,431 --> 02:47:17,900
It's the 19 sixties.
Have we reached like this?

3563
02:47:17,990 --> 02:47:18,823
A bottleneck,
like a physical bottleneck and we'll be 

3564
02:47:20,451 --> 02:47:23,910
able to fix that with like genetic 
engineering will know that.

3565
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,310
No.
Now we're just going to.

3566
02:47:25,370 --> 02:47:26,203
Now we're pointing.
I'm being even stronger and faster 

3567
02:47:28,131 --> 02:47:28,964
though.
Yeah,

3568
02:47:29,360 --> 02:47:30,193
I know,
but just like this is where you saw to 

3569
02:47:31,710 --> 02:47:33,770
that that whole side thing gets real 
interesting.

3570
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:35,120
You know,
and they're,

3571
02:47:35,121 --> 02:47:36,710
they're doing a noble pursuit,
right?

3572
02:47:36,711 --> 02:47:39,320
They try to clean up the game,
stop all the cheaters,

3573
02:47:39,440 --> 02:47:40,820
people getting pop left and right.

3574
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:41,833
I go on the underground,
the underground new section that mixed 

3575
02:47:44,091 --> 02:47:44,924
martial arts.com
and like every couple of days some new 

3576
02:47:46,701 --> 02:47:49,910
persons flagged you find out this guy 
got flagged that kind of got flagged.

3577
02:47:50,540 --> 02:47:53,330
So they're catching people for sure,
but what are they going to do?

3578
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:54,553
What are they going to do when,
when science starts stepping in and 

3579
02:47:58,280 --> 02:48:00,050
improving people.
You know,

3580
02:48:00,660 --> 02:48:03,650
I mean it seems to me like it's pretty 
fucking inevitable.

3581
02:48:05,410 --> 02:48:09,470
I mean right now in mixed martial arts,
let's just take the USC for example.

3582
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:11,870
If I was a manager,
I'd tell my client,

3583
02:48:11,871 --> 02:48:12,704
listen,
I don't give a fuck what you're 

3584
02:48:13,101 --> 02:48:15,050
thinking.
Please don't embarrass me.

3585
02:48:15,700 --> 02:48:16,533
Don't you have a fighter's?
Don't want to be honest about that kind 

3586
02:48:19,071 --> 02:48:19,904
of shit.
I know.

3587
02:48:19,970 --> 02:48:21,780
But you know what?
As a man to man,

3588
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:25,520
you might be on this time.
Yeah.

3589
02:48:25,590 --> 02:48:27,270
I don't want them motherfuckers with 
them.

3590
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:30,290
Yeah,
I think I catch you at the time when you

3591
02:48:30,291 --> 02:48:31,820
don't need it.
You know,

3592
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:32,673
it's interesting.
Apparently they don't know how to spot 

3593
02:48:34,491 --> 02:48:35,324
human growth hormone very well.
It's speculative whether or not they 

3594
02:48:37,881 --> 02:48:38,714
could catch people doing that and it 
might be one of the reasons why they're 

3595
02:48:41,181 --> 02:48:42,014
holding pis and blood for so long.
They hold your sample for like nine 

3596
02:48:45,141 --> 02:48:47,090
years.
They freeze it.

3597
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:49,820
So as the tests get better and better 
and better,

3598
02:48:49,821 --> 02:48:51,620
they pull things back and then the,
you know,

3599
02:48:51,621 --> 02:48:55,810
if you're still competing,
if I can find you and suspend you five,

3600
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:58,970
six years from now,
that is the fucking Kinky Shit.

3601
02:48:59,050 --> 02:49:01,520
You're gonna hold my pis for nine 
fucking years.

3602
02:49:02,330 --> 02:49:05,550
What type of Freaky motherfucker you pop
in there?

3603
02:49:06,050 --> 02:49:08,130
Well they already got rid of two Olympic
gold

3604
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:11,880
medalists from Russia to wrestlers in 
2008.

3605
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:15,330
They both are pissed positive for 
something where they tested negative.

3606
02:49:15,331 --> 02:49:19,410
Then they held onto their sample and now
the screening has gotten much better and

3607
02:49:19,411 --> 02:49:22,950
they just caught them.
They removed their gold medal to Olympic

3608
02:49:22,951 --> 02:49:25,620
medalists.
Gold medalists have no fun,

3609
02:49:25,621 --> 02:49:27,480
no studs to you look at them.
You're like,

3610
02:49:27,510 --> 02:49:32,370
how's that guy on steroids?
She just assumed these Russians,

3611
02:49:32,371 --> 02:49:33,204
man,
they have a different thing going on 

3612
02:49:33,961 --> 02:49:37,320
over there that's state sponsored.
No one's trying to cover that up.

3613
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:39,270
Felt like they,
they just,

3614
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:40,920
they just,
that's what they do.

3615
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:44,160
Like that's one of the reasons why they 
came back close to getting kicked out of

3616
02:49:44,161 --> 02:49:46,290
the Olympics in Rio.
Like they were talking about kicking the

3617
02:49:46,291 --> 02:49:49,560
entire Russian team out of the Olympics 
as like,

3618
02:49:49,561 --> 02:49:54,561
you fucking people have state sponsored 
doping and I think their eyes,

3619
02:49:54,901 --> 02:49:56,490
it's like everybody's doing it.
Fuck it.

3620
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:57,750
Let's just do it the right way.

3621
02:50:02,610 --> 02:50:06,190
So they just grow you into a certain 
age.

3622
02:50:06,670 --> 02:50:08,350
You get to a certain age,
your body,

3623
02:50:08,351 --> 02:50:09,970
but not.
Let's say you would get to a certain age

3624
02:50:09,971 --> 02:50:14,140
and you're a wrestler at a certain days.
They just make you go somewhere.

3625
02:50:14,170 --> 02:50:17,290
It's like Cuba.
I think there's probably no,

3626
02:50:17,300 --> 02:50:19,310
no,
there's a lot going on there.

3627
02:50:19,340 --> 02:50:22,840
And you go somewhere and the doctors 
checked you out and they give you shots.

3628
02:50:22,841 --> 02:50:26,560
They tell you their vitamins don't tell 
you everything that you fucking,

3629
02:50:26,610 --> 02:50:28,980
uh,
which this guy is another one.

3630
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:31,420
This is one of them.
Two wrestlers.

3631
02:50:31,450 --> 02:50:33,340
Oh,
this guy got stripped of a bronze medal.

3632
02:50:33,341 --> 02:50:35,830
Another guy gets tripped the,
if it's state run,

3633
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:38,950
they level with you and it's Russian.
They've only been level with you.

3634
02:50:39,190 --> 02:50:40,110
Which uh,
which date,

3635
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:41,860
what date is this?
When did this article come out?

3636
02:50:41,861 --> 02:50:45,710
Jamie?
Is it a reason?

3637
02:50:47,280 --> 02:50:49,930
Anyway,
point is 2012.

3638
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:51,203
Yeah.
There's two guys that they just did it 

3639
02:50:53,461 --> 02:50:54,294
too from the 2008 Olympics and there,
I'm pretty sure they were both gold 

3640
02:50:58,471 --> 02:51:01,290
medalists,
but uh,

3641
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:02,183
you know,
it's like we were talking about with 

3642
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:05,250
Usada earlier.
So it's,

3643
02:51:05,420 --> 02:51:08,100
it's a weird business man.
Weird business.

3644
02:51:10,030 --> 02:51:12,610
Pino fighting's a weird business.
That's why,

3645
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,410
you know,
you look at that Floyd Mayweather,

3646
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:15,273
Jim fight thing you like and no one 
another sport would they make you have 

3647
02:51:17,681 --> 02:51:21,510
like a basketball game to the death,
like no time moments,

3648
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:23,230
no score in points.
He just,

3649
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:26,110
just rack it up.
Just keep going.

3650
02:51:26,200 --> 02:51:27,033
Just keep going.
And know there's periods like everybody 

3651
02:51:29,591 --> 02:51:32,110
plays by the rules,
not boxing,

3652
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:37,230
like it's a compelling thing to have a 
30 minute round.

3653
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:41,220
You could die doing that kind of shit.
Like that is how people that,

3654
02:51:41,230 --> 02:51:45,720
how that shit gets exposed for real.
He's illegal magnet.

3655
02:51:45,750 --> 02:51:48,060
They tested comedians.
Oh my God.

3656
02:51:48,090 --> 02:51:50,670
Drug tested comedians.
Like certain chains,

3657
02:51:50,671 --> 02:51:54,550
like the Improv or the punchlines like 
chains at La.

3658
02:51:54,580 --> 02:51:56,400
Five clubs said,
listen,

3659
02:51:56,401 --> 02:51:57,234
we've got a drug test you a week before 
you come into our club to make sure 

3660
02:52:00,751 --> 02:52:01,280
that,
you know,

3661
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:04,320
can you imagine that ridiculous for that
we got the entity level.

3662
02:52:04,350 --> 02:52:06,190
So like this.
I'm not even worried about me,

3663
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:08,100
I'm just saying,
you know,

3664
02:52:08,290 --> 02:52:11,380
just the general.
I'm worried about you really.

3665
02:52:11,410 --> 02:52:14,710
You're not worried about me.
Fuck though.

3666
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:17,290
If they started testing for drugs,
I'm not worried about you.

3667
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:20,200
I'm terrified for you.
Just smoke reefer.

3668
02:52:20,201 --> 02:52:20,740
That's it.
Yeah.

3669
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:22,600
But that's a drug.
What are you going to do?

3670
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:26,950
It was like ups would if like a God.
Honestly,

3671
02:52:27,060 --> 02:52:28,210
you know,
what could have happened.

3672
02:52:29,170 --> 02:52:31,330
Okay.
You know what could have happened.

3673
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:32,423
They,
all they would have to do is say 

3674
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:35,470
something like,
uh,

3675
02:52:35,471 --> 02:52:36,304
like maybe someone was really high and 
they were on stage and they said 

3676
02:52:38,561 --> 02:52:43,440
something really ridiculous and the club
got sued and so they'd say we now have a

3677
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:47,530
no marijuana policy because the guy was 
on that fucking devil's cabbage.

3678
02:52:47,531 --> 02:52:49,930
And he said some ridiculous shit and our
club got sued.

3679
02:52:50,710 --> 02:52:53,050
That's all it would take.
I felt like one big chain,

3680
02:52:53,051 --> 02:52:56,170
like maybe Yuck Yuck or the Improv or 
something like that.

3681
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:57,680
They just decided,
uh,

3682
02:52:57,850 --> 02:53:00,040
we do not care what you do in your own 
time,

3683
02:53:00,041 --> 02:53:05,041
but we require when you work for us that
you have a marijuana metabolite level of

3684
02:53:05,171 --> 02:53:07,600
less than whatever the fuck it is.

3685
02:53:09,860 --> 02:53:10,693
So all right.
They would test you when you got the 

3686
02:53:12,471 --> 02:53:15,920
town or the jet after tests you 
beforehand.

3687
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:16,783
So we just show up at your house.
Like you saw it a week before you got 

3688
02:53:21,250 --> 02:53:22,760
the Gig.
They show up at your house,

3689
02:53:22,761 --> 02:53:26,150
like you saw them and then once you get 
there they're going to test you again.

3690
02:53:26,151 --> 02:53:26,984
Or do I have the whole weekend to get 
one test you again at the end of the 

3691
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:35,610
week to just turn their laws?
Those tests are expensive.

3692
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:40,490
Are they the other pot ones?
Like from quest diagnostics.

3693
02:53:40,670 --> 02:53:43,650
That's like a thousand bucks I think.
Which one is the one over the counter at

3694
02:53:44,050 --> 02:53:46,130
all?
You go to quest diagnostics.

3695
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:47,800
Different.
That's the,

3696
02:53:47,830 --> 02:53:50,230
that's what I'm thousand users.
Right?

3697
02:53:51,050 --> 02:53:51,883
Protest this guessing you're going to 
cost me two grand just to come into my 

3698
02:53:55,041 --> 02:53:57,230
fucking clubs to make sure the Improv 
doesn't get sued.

3699
02:53:57,231 --> 02:53:58,110
Sir.
And you've said,

3700
02:53:58,660 --> 02:53:59,493
you've said you've said some very 
defamatory things in the past about 

3701
02:54:03,351 --> 02:54:04,184
Mother Teresa.
What'd you think about a year and Piss 

3702
02:54:06,321 --> 02:54:08,870
test?
100,000

3703
02:54:08,871 --> 02:54:11,840
dollars a costs your company and it's a 
very controversial man.

3704
02:54:11,870 --> 02:54:12,703
Joey Diaz and the business that we're in
here at the Improv is providing with 

3705
02:54:14,811 --> 02:54:16,400
families,
families with laughter.

3706
02:54:16,550 --> 02:54:19,490
Okay.
Some of the things that you've said,

3707
02:54:19,510 --> 02:54:20,890
you know,
quite honestly I,

3708
02:54:20,900 --> 02:54:23,600
I believe in freedom of speech,
but I find it offensive.

3709
02:54:23,630 --> 02:54:24,261
No.
Okay.

3710
02:54:24,261 --> 02:54:27,140
So now we got nowhere to run,
but to go to the rock clubs

3711
02:54:29,450 --> 02:54:30,800
and do comedy.
Well,

3712
02:54:30,801 --> 02:54:32,790
when you go to the rock club then it's 
cool because you're,

3713
02:54:32,830 --> 02:54:34,490
you're,
you're in Japan.

3714
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:39,880
That's like,
stand up to fight the Japan.

3715
02:54:39,900 --> 02:54:41,240
Fuck it.
I'll fight Japan.

3716
02:54:41,241 --> 02:54:43,790
Fuck you motherfuckers.
Hey you coming in on this.

3717
02:54:43,791 --> 02:54:47,030
I'm a election night thing that Stan 
hope and I are doing.

3718
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:48,840
I don't know.
You said some day.

3719
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:50,810
It's like a live part.
We're just gonna hang out.

3720
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:54,350
Where in the main room in the main room 
we're gonna do is we're going to look at

3721
02:54:54,351 --> 02:54:55,184
the results.
We're going to have like a laptop or 

3722
02:54:56,631 --> 02:54:58,160
something,
streams or results,

3723
02:54:58,760 --> 02:54:59,593
and we're gonna.
Just talk some shit while the elections 

3724
02:55:02,001 --> 02:55:04,190
going on.
Most likely

3725
02:55:04,190 --> 02:55:08,450
it will have nothing to do with the 
fucking election dog.

3726
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:09,650
Yes,
please.

3727
02:55:09,650 --> 02:55:11,150
You know I'm a criminal.
Yes.

3728
02:55:11,650 --> 02:55:13,060
And happened.
No,

3729
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:15,830
I can't vote,
but that Hillary is a criminal.

3730
02:55:16,970 --> 02:55:17,803
Well,
they did reopen the investigation into 

3731
02:55:19,801 --> 02:55:21,520
her.
Even that stuff.

3732
02:55:21,521 --> 02:55:23,450
She's been a criminal for fucking 20 
years.

3733
02:55:23,750 --> 02:55:25,790
Trump ain't no better or in a bad 
position.

3734
02:55:25,791 --> 02:55:28,070
Again,
I got no dog in this fight.

3735
02:55:28,071 --> 02:55:30,740
This is from an FEC.
Who Do you refer out of those two?

3736
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:36,590
I really wanted Bernie Sanders to come 
back.

3737
02:55:36,591 --> 02:55:38,000
I don't know.
I don't know.

3738
02:55:38,020 --> 02:55:38,853
Bernie was the best choice,
but if we could keep them around for 

3739
02:55:40,851 --> 02:55:44,030
three years shooting fucking good 
president,

3740
02:55:44,031 --> 02:55:46,610
like something pops up.
You know what I'm saying?

3741
02:55:46,611 --> 02:55:49,760
Like we shoot Bernie Sanders.
If they shot Bernie Sanders,

3742
02:55:49,761 --> 02:55:51,860
he would be.
I've just heard a.

3743
02:55:52,310 --> 02:55:53,143
I read some New York Times thing about a
week ago about arms that are Clinton 

3744
02:55:56,241 --> 02:55:58,850
foundation soul.
Well,

3745
02:55:58,910 --> 02:56:00,680
it's not,
it's not that direct.

3746
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:06,250
It's a very complicated.
As people who were donors to the Clinton

3747
02:56:06,950 --> 02:56:09,410
Foundation received deals.
This didn't.

3748
02:56:09,411 --> 02:56:11,800
My men Ollie North get in trouble for 
shit like this.

3749
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:14,630
Know Ollie north got in trouble for.
They were.

3750
02:56:14,660 --> 02:56:17,190
That was when the sandinistas were 
fighting the contract.

3751
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:19,760
They were shipping arms illegally to 
those people.

3752
02:56:19,761 --> 02:56:22,280
They're providing arms.
These emails about arms,

3753
02:56:22,281 --> 02:56:24,890
right?
I don't know what the emails are king,

3754
02:56:24,891 --> 02:56:26,570
but uh,
there's a lot of them.

3755
02:56:26,660 --> 02:56:27,493
30,000
emails that got deleted after a 

3756
02:56:29,121 --> 02:56:30,920
subpoena.
And you know,

3757
02:56:30,950 --> 02:56:31,783
the crazy thing is people talk.
One of the weird thing that's going on 

3758
02:56:35,361 --> 02:56:37,340
with this election is that everybody 
loves that.

3759
02:56:37,850 --> 02:56:38,683
A woman,
like they're looking at the bright side 

3760
02:56:39,651 --> 02:56:40,360
of things,
right?

3761
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:41,193
Trying to look at the bright side.
It'd be live with fucking fat and it's 

3762
02:56:44,181 --> 02:56:48,350
not going to be the whole little fucking
fat chicks would get tos and bare feet.

3763
02:56:48,660 --> 02:56:51,610
That wedge bag is 180.
All right.

3764
02:56:51,630 --> 02:56:53,420
She's going straight to the clutches of 
Hell.

3765
02:56:53,490 --> 02:56:54,323
You understand me?
Straight to the clutches of how crooked 

3766
02:56:57,411 --> 02:56:59,600
husband the night she gets into the 
White House,

3767
02:56:59,630 --> 02:57:01,910
the lights will all turn red.
Oh my God.

3768
02:57:01,911 --> 02:57:06,911
You'll hear like say tannic music 
playing and trump ain't no better.

3769
02:57:06,921 --> 02:57:09,530
But you also got to remember one thing 
about this fucking moron.

3770
02:57:09,531 --> 02:57:11,060
Okay.
Because I've been thinking about it from

3771
02:57:11,061 --> 02:57:12,230
an objective point of view.

3772
02:57:12,290 --> 02:57:16,010
I'm no fucking Phi Beta kappa.
He's not a politician Bro.

3773
02:57:16,670 --> 02:57:17,503
He was never really a politician.
I may not even be encouraged to do 

3774
02:57:21,801 --> 02:57:22,634
something like this.
So the shit he's talking about grabbing 

3775
02:57:25,221 --> 02:57:26,054
people's policies.
The thing that pissed me off the most 

3776
02:57:28,881 --> 02:57:30,790
about that shit,
you know,

3777
02:57:30,810 --> 02:57:31,643
many times I've seen a woman with a big 
fucking 60 pound monkey me when I'm 

3778
02:57:35,331 --> 02:57:36,164
outside and I just said to myself,
I would grab that motherfucker right 

3779
02:57:38,871 --> 02:57:39,704
now,
but when I was a sophomore in high 

3780
02:57:43,551 --> 02:57:45,860
school,
I had this Italian girl in my class that

3781
02:57:45,861 --> 02:57:48,650
will clogs.
She was a little on the heavy side,

3782
02:57:48,651 --> 02:57:51,560
but she was beautiful.
This girl could stop a fucking clock.

3783
02:57:51,561 --> 02:57:52,394
She was so beautiful,
but her little monkey weighed like 70 

3784
02:57:55,581 --> 02:57:56,414
pounds and she was a sophomore and she 
sat behind me and I just went to school 

3785
02:58:00,141 --> 02:58:00,974
with just the look at her monkey.
I didn't give a fuck about the rest of 

3786
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:03,453
the day.
I didn't even.

3787
02:58:03,750 --> 02:58:06,000
I haven't even seen the vagina at this 
time,

3788
02:58:06,510 --> 02:58:09,810
but through her fucking pants.
You had to see this fucking monster.

3789
02:58:11,010 --> 02:58:13,610
Why she walked past you with it?
Here we go home.

3790
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:19,200
Me and my buddies.
Decorations and senses.

3791
02:58:19,201 --> 02:58:21,840
When you're close to him.
My buddy stinky would collaborate.

3792
02:58:21,870 --> 02:58:22,631
Did you see a?
Yeah.

3793
02:58:22,631 --> 02:58:23,311
Yeah,
I saw it.

3794
02:58:23,311 --> 02:58:25,230
Right.
That means when a pussy look like,

3795
02:58:25,560 --> 02:58:27,660
like right to the jeans.
It was just a mountain.

3796
02:58:28,530 --> 02:58:30,930
It was just a fucking mountain.
Wow.

3797
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:32,033
And I remember her walking by me going,
what would it take for me to have the 

3798
02:58:34,861 --> 02:58:35,694
balls to just grab it and just hold onto
that savage for a minute because it was 

3799
02:58:39,571 --> 02:58:40,810
beautiful.
But the difference.

3800
02:58:41,450 --> 02:58:43,410
How old were you?
13.

3801
02:58:44,070 --> 02:58:45,930
11.
He was 60.

3802
02:58:47,910 --> 02:58:48,743
Oh,
okay.

3803
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:53,780
I get it.
Oh my God.

3804
02:58:59,570 --> 02:59:00,403
You know

3805
02:59:00,750 --> 02:59:01,583
billy bar was on.
I was actually on his podcast the other 

3806
02:59:03,901 --> 02:59:06,360
day and we were talking about it and you
know,

3807
02:59:06,760 --> 02:59:09,150
we're,
we're saying we've heard worse,

3808
02:59:09,300 --> 02:59:10,133
we've heard worse from friends that are 
trying to make each other laugh and 

3809
02:59:13,261 --> 02:59:14,071
you're saying,
shit,

3810
02:59:14,071 --> 02:59:16,080
that's not true.
And I said Joey Diaz would say something

3811
02:59:16,081 --> 02:59:18,500
way worse than that.
And will he be crying?

3812
02:59:19,260 --> 02:59:20,093
Oh my God.
Doesn't mean that you're out actually 

3813
02:59:21,061 --> 02:59:23,460
grabbing girls pussies.
But you would say them,

3814
02:59:23,461 --> 02:59:25,290
I'll,
I'll fuck her feet looked like mine will

3815
02:59:25,291 --> 02:59:27,930
fucking stab a.
like you would say something like,

3816
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:28,823
you know,

3817
02:59:29,190 --> 02:59:29,871
you know.
Yeah.

3818
02:59:29,871 --> 02:59:32,270
That was someone I told Sam that Sam 
trip,

3819
02:59:32,300 --> 02:59:34,330
the other guy.
Steve Simone.

3820
02:59:34,530 --> 02:59:36,620
You see that girl?
How old are you?

3821
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:38,570
40 eight.
I'm 53.

3822
02:59:38,630 --> 02:59:40,100
You're never going to see that.
Very good.

3823
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:43,160
Have you ever seen like a nice looking 
couple now?

3824
02:59:43,161 --> 02:59:46,640
Like he's 26.
She's 22 and that both beautiful.

3825
02:59:47,270 --> 02:59:49,250
She got perky little pits.
She's banging.

3826
02:59:49,251 --> 02:59:50,084
I was so legs are Sunday.
You think that the use of this little 

3827
02:59:52,701 --> 02:59:54,620
young savage must be going home?
Tara,

3828
02:59:54,630 --> 02:59:55,463
that pussy that,
when you think back to your little 26 

3829
02:59:57,111 --> 02:59:57,944
year old in the afternoons,
you can take them home and rub him down 

3830
03:00:00,531 --> 03:00:01,364
and give them a good stab.
You come like three times the whole 

3831
03:00:03,801 --> 03:00:05,540
fucking thing.
That never happens.

3832
03:00:05,541 --> 03:00:07,250
No more.
Like at this age,

3833
03:00:07,251 --> 03:00:09,320
you look at that and go,
I don't know if that happened.

3834
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:11,743
You would think of that.

3835
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:13,020
Yeah.

3836
03:00:15,830 --> 03:00:18,880
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3837
03:00:18,950 --> 03:00:20,130
yeah.
They all these guys like,

3838
03:00:20,150 --> 03:00:21,120
look at that young girl.
Look,

3839
03:00:21,140 --> 03:00:21,973
I'm gonna.
Go look at it,

3840
03:00:22,400 --> 03:00:25,160
look at it.
That'll never happen again in my world.

3841
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:27,830
However,
I will never see a woman naked like that

3842
03:00:27,831 --> 03:00:28,664
ever again.

3843
03:00:28,830 --> 03:00:30,360
Let me tell you a story about my friend 
Jay.

3844
03:00:30,810 --> 03:00:35,810
My friend Jay has a,
a friend who's a Texas oil millionaire.

3845
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:38,550
Like he bought a ranch.
He bought a,

3846
03:00:38,551 --> 03:00:41,070
a hunting ranch,
like to go hunt deer on it.

3847
03:00:41,180 --> 03:00:43,530
That's all he does guys.
Sixty two guys.

3848
03:00:43,531 --> 03:00:45,240
Never had a kid.
Okay.

3849
03:00:45,630 --> 03:00:49,110
And uh,
I think he's been married and divorced.

3850
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:51,390
Maybe never married.
Might be never married,

3851
03:00:51,391 --> 03:00:54,730
never had a kid,
doesn't give a fuck.

3852
03:00:55,200 --> 03:00:57,640
Like literally doesn't give a fuck.
And he,

3853
03:00:57,750 --> 03:01:00,020
every couple,
you

3854
03:01:00,020 --> 03:01:01,060
know,
however long it takes,

3855
03:01:01,360 --> 03:01:06,360
he's got some new 24 year old perfect 
girlfriend and he just buys them a bunch

3856
03:01:07,931 --> 03:01:09,970
of Shit,
take some places.

3857
03:01:10,120 --> 03:01:11,910
And then eventually like,
I can't do this anymore.

3858
03:01:11,911 --> 03:01:12,500
He's like,
well,

3859
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:13,333
you all take care.
And he just goes and gets him another 

3860
03:01:14,891 --> 03:01:15,820
one.
And he's like,

3861
03:01:15,821 --> 03:01:20,821
I want you to come meet the new one.
But this guy is the quintessential crazy

3862
03:01:21,130 --> 03:01:25,960
Texas oil man.
So this guy goes to Africa and uh,

3863
03:01:25,990 --> 03:01:28,090
and he goes,
what'd you do over in Africa?

3864
03:01:28,091 --> 03:01:28,930
Goes on,
Shit.

3865
03:01:28,931 --> 03:01:30,580
We went hunting.
He go,

3866
03:01:30,581 --> 03:01:31,361
well,
what'd you shoot?

3867
03:01:31,361 --> 03:01:32,330
He goes,
Noah's Ark,

3868
03:01:32,650 --> 03:01:35,250
two of everything.
So it just shows up.

3869
03:01:35,980 --> 03:01:36,813
He stayed over in Africa for a month 
just shooting things with this 24 year 

3870
03:01:40,631 --> 03:01:44,680
old girl.
He was banging Jose Sixty two.

3871
03:01:45,850 --> 03:01:46,683
He had um,
he had a bunch of different bypasses 

3872
03:01:50,681 --> 03:01:54,220
too.
He's had more than one by heart bypass.

3873
03:01:54,250 --> 03:01:55,740
Like he's fucked.
Like he's,

3874
03:01:55,770 --> 03:02:00,770
he ain't got much time left in.
This guy is just poverty and own woo.

3875
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:04,360
I think if I saw a push a younger than 
30,

3876
03:02:04,361 --> 03:02:05,770
I would have a bypass.
Right?

3877
03:02:05,790 --> 03:02:07,420
Right there.
My heart would split open.

3878
03:02:07,421 --> 03:02:09,590
I don't want to see it.
I don't like.

3879
03:02:09,591 --> 03:02:10,480
I don't.
I'm done.

3880
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:11,393
I'm bored.
Where would you have the energy to keep 

3881
03:02:12,971 --> 03:02:13,880
up with that?
No.

3882
03:02:14,350 --> 03:02:16,540
Twenty two year olds that want to fuck 
like rabbits.

3883
03:02:16,800 --> 03:02:19,000
You don't have mortgages,
you know?

3884
03:02:19,050 --> 03:02:21,190
I mean I have to do is be awake when you
show up for work,

3885
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:23,050
so that's your responsibility when be 
22,

3886
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:25,420
unless you fucked up horribly and gotten
yourself into some,

3887
03:02:26,080 --> 03:02:28,450
some real serious position of 
responsibility.

3888
03:02:28,451 --> 03:02:30,820
But most of us are 22.
No,

3889
03:02:30,970 --> 03:02:31,803
barely show up for work.
If you've got fired and trying to get 

3890
03:02:33,581 --> 03:02:35,380
another job anyway,
you're already thinking about quitting.

3891
03:02:36,370 --> 03:02:37,203
So when you're home,
when you're home with some girls also 

3892
03:02:38,681 --> 03:02:41,580
22,
you got just too bizarre.

3893
03:02:41,640 --> 03:02:43,090
Just chewing up a piece of wood.

3894
03:02:45,870 --> 03:02:49,420
It's chaos.
Just chopping through your own young.

3895
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:52,990
Just trying to get rid of come.
It's crazy.

3896
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:57,550
I would never happen again.
Well it might,

3897
03:02:57,610 --> 03:02:59,530
but it's not gonna happen in this life.
No.

3898
03:02:59,590 --> 03:03:02,410
It might happen all over again.
I don't.

3899
03:03:02,411 --> 03:03:03,244
Like I said,
I don't even want to see a vagina if 

3900
03:03:04,451 --> 03:03:06,870
it's under 40 anymore.
We've given me a heart attack.

3901
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:10,000
I don't meet that my life.
You don't have been thinking about a lot

3902
03:03:10,001 --> 03:03:13,840
lately.
Why so many cultures?

3903
03:03:13,841 --> 03:03:17,320
Think about reincarnation.
Why so many cultures believe you do this

3904
03:03:17,321 --> 03:03:18,154
over and over and over again.
Why so many people think you come back 

3905
03:03:22,020 --> 03:03:24,490
so you know the,
the,

3906
03:03:24,610 --> 03:03:26,770
the idea that we live and we die.
That's what.

3907
03:03:27,090 --> 03:03:29,560
That's what like someone who's an 
atheist,

3908
03:03:29,561 --> 03:03:32,920
once you believe you're born and you die
and they might be right.

3909
03:03:32,950 --> 03:03:33,783
I don't know who's right or who's wrong,
but it is kind of fucking weird that so 

3910
03:03:38,231 --> 03:03:41,920
many different cultures have this idea 
that you live again.

3911
03:03:42,290 --> 03:03:45,670
What have you just keep doing this?
Would that freak you out?

3912
03:03:46,540 --> 03:03:48,250
Like I'm enjoying life,
right?

3913
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:49,413
But why is,
why is the prospect of doing this over 

3914
03:03:52,241 --> 03:03:53,074
and over again forever?
Like what if you had to live your 

3915
03:03:54,731 --> 03:03:58,040
childhood like your childhood?
Joey was a very tumultuous

3916
03:03:58,040 --> 03:04:00,860
and crazy fucking childhood,
but it made you,

3917
03:04:00,861 --> 03:04:01,694
you.
If you knew that you had to start all 

3918
03:04:05,811 --> 03:04:08,530
over again and you're gonna,
you're gonna,

3919
03:04:08,550 --> 03:04:11,930
close your eyes for the last time and 
you're going to wake up in that hospital

3920
03:04:11,931 --> 03:04:13,220
room,
North Bergen,

3921
03:04:13,221 --> 03:04:14,270
New Jersey,
or in Cuba,

3922
03:04:16,630 --> 03:04:18,970
and you can do the whole thing again.
Same Way,

3923
03:04:19,500 --> 03:04:20,980
same way.
Oh my God.

3924
03:04:21,990 --> 03:04:23,050
You gotta get it,
right.

3925
03:04:23,830 --> 03:04:28,570
You're dealing it with variations.
So come back like as a bird this time,

3926
03:04:29,410 --> 03:04:31,610
that's what they do.
They fuck with you for a couple of times

3927
03:04:31,611 --> 03:04:34,480
that bring it back as an alligator.
You get run over in Florida.

3928
03:04:35,230 --> 03:04:36,063
Then they bring you back as a bird,
like a parakeet when the cat gets you 

3929
03:04:39,990 --> 03:04:42,250
and then you come back as a human.
Yeah.

3930
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:43,113
And then you start all over again.
Then there's times in your life where 

3931
03:04:45,281 --> 03:04:46,660
you think,
I've been here before.

3932
03:04:47,430 --> 03:04:50,440
I've seen this before.
Like I've something.

3933
03:04:51,130 --> 03:04:53,560
And so that's what I feel about 
reincarnation.

3934
03:04:53,561 --> 03:04:55,060
I don't know.
I don't know.

3935
03:04:55,061 --> 03:04:56,430
It's.
I've been at places and I've gotten.

3936
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:58,570
I've been here before,
but then again,

3937
03:04:58,571 --> 03:05:00,430
you have to think about what scientists 
believe.

3938
03:05:00,431 --> 03:05:04,670
That life is just an illusion that the 
patterns that we see are just graded our

3939
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:05,533
mind.

3940
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:08,560
Who the fuck knows I'm having a good 
time to refill.

3941
03:05:08,561 --> 03:05:10,090
Calms me down.
Yeah.

3942
03:05:10,130 --> 03:05:12,910
You know what I'm saying?
What else we're doing comedy.

3943
03:05:12,911 --> 03:05:13,744
What?
Healthy.

3944
03:05:13,960 --> 03:05:17,440
We're having fun.
Still fucking ear or picking up the vine

3945
03:05:17,470 --> 03:05:20,170
like,
you know guys have come and fucking gun,

3946
03:05:20,171 --> 03:05:21,430
you know.
Oh yeah.

3947
03:05:21,490 --> 03:05:22,323
So how lucky am I think I'm going to sit
here and think about fucking going to 

3948
03:05:24,971 --> 03:05:27,310
Mars with Elon.
I'm not sure.

3949
03:05:27,311 --> 03:05:28,300
Is that his name?
Eland.

3950
03:05:28,330 --> 03:05:30,220
Eli Musk.
That's my dawg dude.

3951
03:05:30,221 --> 03:05:31,620
We've known each other for almost 20 
years.

3952
03:05:31,650 --> 03:05:33,760
Twenty years.
Has It been 20?

3953
03:05:33,761 --> 03:05:38,761
It might be 20 this giant this January 
I'll be in La for 20.

3954
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:42,580
Which means I met you march of next 
year.

3955
03:05:42,581 --> 03:05:43,420
I got.
I became,

3956
03:05:43,450 --> 03:05:46,800
I got,
I landed in La January 20th and you know

3957
03:05:46,810 --> 03:05:49,180
I was a regular at the store.
February 19th.

3958
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:50,830
Wow.
My birthday.

3959
03:05:50,831 --> 03:05:53,770
That was my only ever claim to fame in 
this town.

3960
03:05:54,400 --> 03:05:56,350
I was here.
Stan hope referred me.

3961
03:05:56,410 --> 03:05:57,243
I did seven.
She told me come back next week and she 

3962
03:06:00,101 --> 03:06:03,010
made me a regular.
It was like written in the movie.

3963
03:06:03,370 --> 03:06:08,370
I showed up at the comedy store up 
Monday night at 1130 and 11 slash 25.

3964
03:06:08,441 --> 03:06:09,274
I think Griffin said,
do you mind if I do 10 minutes in front 

3965
03:06:10,901 --> 03:06:14,320
of you and that was my comedy store 
debut and Shit.

3966
03:06:14,630 --> 03:06:17,490
Like how much time did he do?
He went right to attend to.

3967
03:06:18,650 --> 03:06:22,030
He would do like three hours.
He would do three fucking hours,

3968
03:06:22,060 --> 03:06:23,590
but still.
That was a.

3969
03:06:24,370 --> 03:06:27,190
that's what kept me here was that stupid
fucking comedy store brother.

3970
03:06:27,191 --> 03:06:29,230
How great is that?
That I just walked in there.

3971
03:06:29,650 --> 03:06:32,590
Stan hope I kept.
I'm introduced myself to Scott Day.

3972
03:06:33,440 --> 03:06:37,120
Stan Ho said to me,
it's a six week minimal.

3973
03:06:37,121 --> 03:06:38,620
Wait,
I called in for you.

3974
03:06:39,510 --> 03:06:43,210
I had three people calling for me I 
think and he was one of them.

3975
03:06:43,210 --> 03:06:46,720
They believe Stan hope the most and they
called me on a Friday though.

3976
03:06:47,660 --> 03:06:49,770
I said,
you're going up in front of Mitzi Sunday

3977
03:06:49,780 --> 03:06:51,000
at nine,
whatever.

3978
03:06:51,450 --> 03:06:53,230
I have three minutes ready.
And I was like,

3979
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:56,280
what the fuck?
I thought I had to wait til April.

3980
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:58,010
Wow.
Like no,

3981
03:06:58,020 --> 03:07:00,000
there was an opening on the list.
Go down there.

3982
03:07:01,990 --> 03:07:04,150
We've seen a lot of guys come and go.
You ever go down the.

3983
03:07:04,260 --> 03:07:06,030
One of the cool things about the comedy 
store,

3984
03:07:06,390 --> 03:07:10,530
one of the coolest things is that the 
walls are like a museum,

3985
03:07:10,860 --> 03:07:13,830
like literally like a comedy museum.
There is no comedy museum,

3986
03:07:14,070 --> 03:07:16,160
so for us,
the comedy museums of the wall,

3987
03:07:16,161 --> 03:07:18,720
so places like the punchline,
you know,

3988
03:07:18,721 --> 03:07:19,554
like when you go to an older club,
Nashville's Zania Zania national best 

3989
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:26,010
example pictures that'll make your jaw 
drop.

3990
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:26,880
Yup.
Yup.

3991
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:29,280
People that aren't even alive anymore 
and people are not.

3992
03:07:29,490 --> 03:07:31,800
People that were really big and they 
just stopped.

3993
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:34,280
Tom Models is a one night or out of 
Iowa,

3994
03:07:34,290 --> 03:07:37,980
like when you go to rooms and Wyoming 
cribble runs,

3995
03:07:37,981 --> 03:07:40,610
which are one nighters that's different 
than a station.

3996
03:07:40,611 --> 03:07:41,444
Every comedy club for people at home.
That means that a bar with a certain 

3997
03:07:44,341 --> 03:07:47,430
town just does comedy on Tuesday nights 
every night.

3998
03:07:48,060 --> 03:07:48,893
I went to a place in Riverton,
Wyoming and they had pictures of 

3999
03:07:50,911 --> 03:07:54,600
Roseanne and Tom,
Roseanne and Tom Arnold together.

4000
03:07:55,020 --> 03:07:56,970
When they first started going on the 
road together,

4001
03:07:56,971 --> 03:07:59,580
like he had the business for a long 
time,

4002
03:07:59,790 --> 03:08:01,700
that's when they're out of Denver,
out of Denver,

4003
03:08:02,490 --> 03:08:03,323
Minneapolis.
I thought she was married to somebody 

4004
03:08:04,741 --> 03:08:08,970
else and then they got a divorce and she
left and I think she went to Minneapolis

4005
03:08:08,971 --> 03:08:11,970
for a while.
I toured with them and uh,

4006
03:08:12,660 --> 03:08:13,590
wow.
You know,

4007
03:08:13,591 --> 03:08:16,170
that's one of the sad things about when 
a comedy club closes down,

4008
03:08:16,200 --> 03:08:17,370
you lose that museum.

4009
03:08:17,580 --> 03:08:21,870
Like they used to be.
The last stop in river oaks had pictures

4010
03:08:21,871 --> 03:08:24,720
of Stan hope when he bad long luxurious 
hair.

4011
03:08:25,110 --> 03:08:30,110
Remember when Stan hope had like fabio 
hair stand hope.

4012
03:08:30,301 --> 03:08:34,530
He used to wear an overcoat and he had 
long hair and I remember like,

4013
03:08:35,130 --> 03:08:37,740
I think I had heard that he didn't even 
have a place to live,

4014
03:08:37,910 --> 03:08:38,743
just like a car got broken into the 
finals of the San Francisco comedy 

4015
03:08:44,761 --> 03:08:46,170
competition.
Overfilling.

4016
03:08:46,330 --> 03:08:47,163
And he went and bought like a secondhand
suit and he went back there and smoke 

4017
03:08:49,650 --> 03:08:52,140
everybody with the suit on his shit.
Yeah.

4018
03:08:52,141 --> 03:08:52,974
That's where a Dane Cook's manager tried
to psych him out before he went on 

4019
03:08:56,631 --> 03:08:57,850
stage.
What did he say to them?

4020
03:08:57,990 --> 03:09:00,480
Something Dickie,
you know,

4021
03:09:00,570 --> 03:09:01,920
something Dickie like,
you know,

4022
03:09:01,930 --> 03:09:03,730
you're never going to beat him or 
something like that.

4023
03:09:03,731 --> 03:09:08,250
Like something really shitty stand 
helpline of winning and crushed it.

4024
03:09:11,160 --> 03:09:15,840
I saw his son at that time was fucking 
amazing.

4025
03:09:15,880 --> 03:09:20,190
Gyro and he's amazing now is set.
At that time he had,

4026
03:09:20,610 --> 03:09:25,610
he had connected the bridge from me.
That's what put me on the right path,

4027
03:09:26,160 --> 03:09:26,993
the bridge of when I watched what he was
doing in the half hour that when he was 

4028
03:09:32,311 --> 03:09:36,420
headlining his first half hour,
then just the way he was delivering it,

4029
03:09:36,850 --> 03:09:40,410
his presentation when he was young at 
the audience when they walked,

4030
03:09:41,190 --> 03:09:44,260
it was all a fucking thing of genius.
It,

4031
03:09:44,300 --> 03:09:45,133
it hit me so hard that I didn't do 
comedy for about four days to gather up 

4032
03:09:49,650 --> 03:09:52,500
like what am I going to do with my life?
Because if I'm not that good,

4033
03:09:52,860 --> 03:09:54,160
it's not,
we're doing this shit.

4034
03:09:55,060 --> 03:09:55,893
You know?
At that time he was doing the bucket of 

4035
03:09:57,641 --> 03:09:58,580
Vaginas,
joke,

4036
03:09:59,120 --> 03:10:02,680
some way to come up to him and asked him
if he wants to buy a bucket of roses and

4037
03:10:02,681 --> 03:10:03,514
a bar.

4038
03:10:03,580 --> 03:10:04,413
I don't need roses,
I need a bucket of vaginas and then the 

4039
03:10:07,181 --> 03:10:08,014
lady would walk out,
but I'll never forget that he said that 

4040
03:10:10,310 --> 03:10:12,670
what?
I read the back of the class because she

4041
03:10:12,671 --> 03:10:13,504
walks out and then some lady in the 
audience actually gets up and walks out 

4042
03:10:17,020 --> 03:10:17,771
and he's like,
lady,

4043
03:10:17,771 --> 03:10:20,940
I'm sorry I should've said this one 
online.

4044
03:10:21,580 --> 03:10:25,350
People would walk and then he'd say 
things to them as they were walking out,

4045
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:28,630
but it was so brilliant.
The people couldn't take it no more.

4046
03:10:30,360 --> 03:10:31,193
I loved what he was doing on stage.
He was talking about going to a bar and 

4047
03:10:34,490 --> 03:10:35,323
the g string was stuck in the girl's 
fucking thing and it was in there 

4048
03:10:38,021 --> 03:10:39,820
somewhere.
I'm not doing any justice to this.

4049
03:10:40,390 --> 03:10:43,150
It didn't matter what he was doing on 
stage.

4050
03:10:43,180 --> 03:10:48,180
Nobody was really doing at that time and
then he came to La and the way that they

4051
03:10:49,451 --> 03:10:51,990
were trying to make that fucking squeaky
clean,

4052
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:52,833
squeaky clean,
and he went in and I was in the night 

4053
03:10:54,431 --> 03:10:58,590
when he insulted the burn victim,
pick people up there.

4054
03:10:58,600 --> 03:11:00,040
The Guy,
he goes,

4055
03:11:00,041 --> 03:11:00,874
what the fuck you people depressed?
This guy hasn't cracked a smile and now 

4056
03:11:03,830 --> 03:11:04,571
you know,
I mean,

4057
03:11:04,571 --> 03:11:08,260
he didn't stop for awhile.
Then he started walking the Improv,

4058
03:11:08,261 --> 03:11:09,094
you know,
like on those nights where all the 

4059
03:11:11,681 --> 03:11:13,870
professionals and the Egos,
you know what I'm saying,

4060
03:11:14,500 --> 03:11:15,333
they would put him on and they would pay
and then Mitzi shore made a mistake and 

4061
03:11:22,230 --> 03:11:26,880
she started putting that motherfucker 
before betsy sokolow.

4062
03:11:27,970 --> 03:11:30,260
That's not a mistake.
It's a mistake.

4063
03:11:30,790 --> 03:11:35,790
Was she had a method.
She enjoyed watching that show.

4064
03:11:36,220 --> 03:11:39,320
But once you watched it at that time and
you know,

4065
03:11:39,390 --> 03:11:40,223
I'd tell you how it is to show opens up 
at what time at the comedy store and 

4066
03:11:43,271 --> 03:11:48,271
Saturdays 8:30.
In those days she will put Doug Stanhope

4067
03:11:49,001 --> 03:11:54,001
one third and then he would be,
he would hit so hard in the original.

4068
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:58,720
They would see who first political guy.

4069
03:11:59,390 --> 03:12:03,480
Then they will have a buffalo and she 
didn't really know who stan hope was.

4070
03:12:04,090 --> 03:12:06,750
She had forgotten and she put them up in
the,

4071
03:12:06,960 --> 03:12:09,390
the fucking nine.
You know,

4072
03:12:09,490 --> 03:12:14,320
the third guy on the list on a Saturday.
They were not ready for him.

4073
03:12:14,890 --> 03:12:15,723
I remember one particular Saturday he 
was talking about lesbians with a Dick 

4074
03:12:20,140 --> 03:12:22,000
Pumps and a softball game where they all
had.

4075
03:12:22,001 --> 03:12:22,834
I mean he was just going off and the 
original room didn't even know where he 

4076
03:12:26,411 --> 03:12:29,200
was going,
like nobody knew he was going,

4077
03:12:30,270 --> 03:12:33,130
you're a fucking lesbian softball 
player.

4078
03:12:33,131 --> 03:12:35,430
You probably in the fucking thing with a
Dick pump,

4079
03:12:36,200 --> 03:12:39,240
and he even made a cover.
He's got an album cover dick.

4080
03:12:39,880 --> 03:12:42,850
That was that bit.
They want to fucking.

4081
03:12:43,290 --> 03:12:46,030
I'm sitting back there stone to the 
Gills confused.

4082
03:12:46,240 --> 03:12:48,640
They were out of it,
but the saddest thing,

4083
03:12:48,641 --> 03:12:49,810
Joe Rogan,
honestly,

4084
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:51,710
it wasn't the guy that him.

4085
03:12:52,220 --> 03:12:56,270
It was the two people that follow stand 
up in those days were in a lurch because

4086
03:12:56,300 --> 03:12:59,420
the second guy that followed Stan hope 
was all fucked up.

4087
03:12:59,421 --> 03:13:03,470
He just put bad energy,
general bombs in those days.

4088
03:13:03,471 --> 03:13:06,290
Hollywood wasn't ready for staying at 
home and I saw it.

4089
03:13:07,070 --> 03:13:12,070
I saw that the Security Council approach
to stand up,

4090
03:13:12,860 --> 03:13:13,940
the Hollywood approach,
the stand.

4091
03:13:13,941 --> 03:13:16,660
I was changed like he used to be.
You know,

4092
03:13:16,670 --> 03:13:18,920
there were,
there were all boards.

4093
03:13:19,130 --> 03:13:21,260
They had a letter send down.
That's what happened.

4094
03:13:21,410 --> 03:13:23,020
Well,
they were all had 11 sitcoms,

4095
03:13:23,070 --> 03:13:23,910
you know they will.
Yeah,

4096
03:13:23,960 --> 03:13:26,000
because people will funny.
Yeah,

4097
03:13:26,001 --> 03:13:28,400
we can name a lot of.
We could sit here for two fucking hours.

4098
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:29,533
We may have a lot of people that came to
this town who would genuinely funny and 

4099
03:13:32,451 --> 03:13:34,370
then some fucking suit got to him and 
said,

4100
03:13:34,371 --> 03:13:35,204
listen,
you have to write your Sitcom for these 

4101
03:13:36,801 --> 03:13:39,020
people and talk about your stage 
persona.

4102
03:13:39,290 --> 03:13:42,740
And then they went up there and change 
that whole stand up and you know what?

4103
03:13:42,800 --> 03:13:45,530
That's funny in a way,
but it's not really who to fuck you up.

4104
03:13:45,650 --> 03:13:47,150
Right.
And that's what happened.

4105
03:13:47,151 --> 03:13:47,984
People got away from that for a few 
years are years 96 to 2004 people got 

4106
03:13:53,901 --> 03:13:54,734
away from that.
People still want you to build a sitcom 

4107
03:13:56,300 --> 03:13:59,390
on stage,
but when that fucking idea went awry,

4108
03:14:00,410 --> 03:14:01,243
they hadn't.
They hadn't let fucking people with a 

4109
03:14:02,860 --> 03:14:06,150
little crazy and it seems like the 
podcast era.

4110
03:14:06,650 --> 03:14:10,520
Then people got to understand how much 
entertainment there is.

4111
03:14:10,850 --> 03:14:13,220
Just people being themselves,
just crazy people.

4112
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:17,730
People like you or people like already 
or people like a Dunkin started.

4113
03:14:17,750 --> 03:14:22,490
People started recognizing that when you
let a guy just be himself or a girl just

4114
03:14:22,491 --> 03:14:25,190
be themselves,
you're going to get the real thing.

4115
03:14:25,191 --> 03:14:26,510
You're going to find out what's actually
funny.

4116
03:14:26,820 --> 03:14:27,653
Well,
it really makes you realize is how much 

4117
03:14:28,941 --> 03:14:32,480
media does control what you watch and 
see whether it's music.

4118
03:14:32,481 --> 03:14:33,710
It's comedians.
Let's pretend the,

4119
03:14:33,730 --> 03:14:36,410
but there was no venue for standup like 
that except for Hbo.

4120
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:40,820
Let's pretend that right now,
podcasts would not have come up in this.

4121
03:14:40,821 --> 03:14:43,310
In the last 10 years.
You would know me.

4122
03:14:43,311 --> 03:14:44,640
You wouldn't know Stan Ho.
No,

4123
03:14:44,690 --> 03:14:45,450
you wouldn't know.
Stan.

4124
03:14:45,450 --> 03:14:47,450
Hope you wouldn't know are.
You wouldn't know Duncan.

4125
03:14:47,810 --> 03:14:48,643
You wouldn't know a half a fucking 
decent comics that are floating around 

4126
03:14:51,500 --> 03:14:53,510
because the people who are controlling 
comedy,

4127
03:14:53,870 --> 03:14:54,703
uh,
controlling comedy due to certain 

4128
03:14:56,190 --> 03:14:58,490
criterias,
youth age,

4129
03:14:59,140 --> 03:15:01,820
it all has to mix up.
It all has to mix up.

4130
03:15:01,821 --> 03:15:05,550
If it doesn't make up and I'm not crying
fucking Wolfie I,

4131
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:07,490
I,
I'm happy with the fuck I'm doing.

4132
03:15:07,491 --> 03:15:10,280
I've done great compared to what I 
thought I was going to fucking do.

4133
03:15:10,280 --> 03:15:11,950
So I'm talking about,
uh,

4134
03:15:12,260 --> 03:15:14,210
sometimes I'll call somebody and they 
go,

4135
03:15:14,211 --> 03:15:15,410
no,
you're too old for this thing.

4136
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:16,513
Well,
you got to think about what people are 

4137
03:15:18,060 --> 03:15:19,780
watching.
What can a guy like you to do?

4138
03:15:19,820 --> 03:15:20,653
You could do one or two things.
You can either do an hbo special or you 

4139
03:15:22,851 --> 03:15:25,280
can do nothing.
You don't have uncensored radio.

4140
03:15:25,281 --> 03:15:27,820
Back then they didn't even until series 
came along and Xm,

4141
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:30,020
you didn't even have a venue on the 
radio,

4142
03:15:30,260 --> 03:15:31,093
so you had nothing.
You had nothing to be you and your 

4143
03:15:33,441 --> 03:15:36,500
stories and all your craziness where 
you're free like this.

4144
03:15:36,980 --> 03:15:40,410
And so it wasn't a product to sell.
There was no pulse.

4145
03:15:40,440 --> 03:15:41,273
There's no market.
So unless you became a Kennison or a 

4146
03:15:42,951 --> 03:15:47,270
dice clay or someone who got an hbo 
special or a gut on Rodney Dangerfield,

4147
03:15:47,271 --> 03:15:50,460
hbo special with the world got 
introduced to you being dirty,

4148
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:51,833
no one was really going to buy it.
There was nowhere bitch we got on Joe 

4149
03:15:54,780 --> 03:15:56,030
Rogan's podcast,
motherfucker,

4150
03:15:56,460 --> 03:15:59,880
you're the new fucking run.
You also have fucking Comedians to these

4151
03:15:59,881 --> 03:16:00,714
people.
They would never even dreamed about 

4152
03:16:02,641 --> 03:16:03,474
going to watch who.
I remember years ago when we went up to 

4153
03:16:06,510 --> 03:16:07,800
fucking cops,
the dude,

4154
03:16:07,850 --> 03:16:08,490
man,
I,

4155
03:16:08,490 --> 03:16:11,450
that shit used to bother me because that
was how we were viewed as,

4156
03:16:11,880 --> 03:16:12,660
well,
they didn't,

4157
03:16:12,660 --> 03:16:13,493
they didn't respect you guys know,
but in they thought because you guys 

4158
03:16:15,241 --> 03:16:18,350
didn't have tv credits and because you 
were dirty that uh,

4159
03:16:18,390 --> 03:16:19,223
you know,
I was making a bad choice by bringing 

4160
03:16:20,581 --> 03:16:21,181
you with me.
I'm like,

4161
03:16:21,181 --> 03:16:23,340
what are you talking about?
These guys are hilarious.

4162
03:16:23,370 --> 03:16:25,300
That stuff is fucking tremendous.
Amazing.

4163
03:16:25,650 --> 03:16:28,340
Fucked up.
I didn't bother now,

4164
03:16:29,280 --> 03:16:31,630
although some people probably St Joe you
were quietly.

4165
03:16:31,660 --> 03:16:32,890
No,
I blacked out for a while.

4166
03:16:32,891 --> 03:16:35,280
I went deep is a lot in that.

4167
03:16:35,280 --> 03:16:39,360
I took 10 fucking thing.
He did a podcast with Sam Harris.

4168
03:16:39,510 --> 03:16:43,680
Ten 10 sprays.
Took two before I got here too.

4169
03:16:43,681 --> 03:16:46,440
But I think those are kind of worn off 
and I decided to just see what happens.

4170
03:16:46,441 --> 03:16:47,670
We know what's good about this.
You don't,

4171
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:49,590
you don't go deep for eight hours.
No.

4172
03:16:49,740 --> 03:16:51,000
The other shit,
I got to commit to it.

4173
03:16:51,030 --> 03:16:53,820
I liked this little sprayer.
I just look for when it.

4174
03:16:53,830 --> 03:16:55,500
That was a little fucked up.
I ain't gonna lie to you.

4175
03:16:55,830 --> 03:16:57,810
I was seeing doubles.
I thought about taking a nap.

4176
03:16:57,930 --> 03:16:58,950
Well,
I think easy in.

4177
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:00,000
Easy out,
right?

4178
03:17:00,001 --> 03:17:02,130
Because like it's not digesting in your 
stomach.

4179
03:17:02,220 --> 03:17:04,380
It's going through your bloodstream 
because you're doing it,

4180
03:17:04,410 --> 03:17:05,700
you know,
Trans Dermal.

4181
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:06,623
Was that what it is?
What is it called when you put it on 

4182
03:17:08,171 --> 03:17:10,860
your.
A subdermal right.

4183
03:17:10,980 --> 03:17:11,813
That was good there for a moment because
I hate that fucking bob before I came 

4184
03:17:14,401 --> 03:17:15,090
in.

4185
03:17:15,090 --> 03:17:15,990
Oh,
you did that too.

4186
03:17:16,050 --> 03:17:17,370
How dare you?
Why not?

4187
03:17:17,930 --> 03:17:18,601
Why?
Yeah,

4188
03:17:18,601 --> 03:17:19,434
why not?
I got to dress up like a fucking 

4189
03:17:21,350 --> 03:17:22,830
counseling lingual.
Thank you sir.

4190
03:17:22,980 --> 03:17:25,540
I got to dress up like a cowboy jack.
I'm excited.

4191
03:17:25,570 --> 03:17:27,910
I don't know what my wife's going to be.
She's trying to the baby.

4192
03:17:27,930 --> 03:17:29,670
Don't be an Indian.
People get mad at you.

4193
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:32,640
Cultural appropriation didn't know what 
the fuck's her name.

4194
03:17:32,641 --> 03:17:34,560
Have to apologize.
Hilary Duff.

4195
03:17:34,590 --> 03:17:36,810
Didn't she apologize for Halloween 
costume?

4196
03:17:37,020 --> 03:17:40,260
That was cultural appropriation.
What was her costume?

4197
03:17:40,320 --> 03:17:43,740
She was a pilgrim and I think the second
lesson.

4198
03:17:43,770 --> 03:17:45,210
So you can't be an Indian.
No more.

4199
03:17:45,240 --> 03:17:47,700
No more Indians.
No more cowboys and Indians.

4200
03:17:47,730 --> 03:17:51,200
Cowboys versus cowboys.
And if you do encounter an Indian,

4201
03:17:51,210 --> 03:17:52,043
he better be an actual fucking Indian,
not some culturally appropriating cis 

4202
03:17:55,281 --> 03:17:56,114
gendered white piece of Shit.
Hilary Duff is so sorry about her 

4203
03:17:59,461 --> 03:18:01,980
offensive Halloween costume.

4204
03:18:02,850 --> 03:18:05,460
Oh my God.
So the man you see,

4205
03:18:05,461 --> 03:18:08,370
people haven't gotten the full message 
yet from the social justice warriors.

4206
03:18:09,400 --> 03:18:10,740
They haven't gotten the full message 
yet.

4207
03:18:10,780 --> 03:18:11,613
You're not allowed to wear that.
Indian social justice warriors fill me 

4208
03:18:13,651 --> 03:18:14,484
in on this.
Social Justice warriors are people that 

4209
03:18:15,961 --> 03:18:16,794
want to control the way people behave.
They want everyone to be very 

4210
03:18:18,931 --> 03:18:22,620
progressive and very pieces that were 
page and no now to just a group.

4211
03:18:22,770 --> 03:18:24,870
And we're going to enforce cultural 
appropriation.

4212
03:18:24,871 --> 03:18:26,710
No white guys with dreadlocks.
Stop it.

4213
03:18:27,340 --> 03:18:29,400
Stop.
No,

4214
03:18:29,401 --> 03:18:31,650
you can't have taco Tuesday piece of 
shit.

4215
03:18:31,950 --> 03:18:32,783
It's cultural appropriation.
They get mad if white guys cooked 

4216
03:18:34,951 --> 03:18:37,230
Chinese food.
It's like there's so much going on.

4217
03:18:37,290 --> 03:18:38,123
I get mad of white guys because I know 
why the Chinese guy cooking the Chinese 

4218
03:18:41,581 --> 03:18:43,220
for that.
That's what's wrong with fucking thing.

4219
03:18:43,230 --> 03:18:45,630
That's true.
You know what else I demand for the most

4220
03:18:45,631 --> 03:18:48,070
part?
I like Mexican food from Mexican

4221
03:18:48,070 --> 03:18:49,430
people.
Um,

4222
03:18:49,450 --> 03:18:50,283
there's a guy that was getting in 
trouble for cultural appropriation 

4223
03:18:52,151 --> 03:18:54,240
because he was,
he ran a Mexican restaurant,

4224
03:18:54,270 --> 03:18:55,103
he's a white guy from Oklahoma and it 
was a huge stinker through and 

4225
03:18:58,121 --> 03:18:58,954
apparently this guy's a huge fan of 
Mexican cooking and is a real like 

4226
03:19:01,901 --> 03:19:02,734
master chef and goes to Mexico and 
studied under the great Mexican chefs 

4227
03:19:05,801 --> 03:19:06,634
and opens up Mexican restaurants in 
America just because he loves Mexican 

4228
03:19:09,610 --> 03:19:11,530
food and they're like,
fuck you.

4229
03:19:11,531 --> 03:19:13,780
You're not Mexican.
You can't do it.

4230
03:19:14,050 --> 03:19:17,140
Culture appropriation,
fuck away.

4231
03:19:17,830 --> 03:19:18,663
We're apologizing for Indian costume 
before I go right now because I want to 

4232
03:19:22,061 --> 03:19:22,894
turn on three is I'll tell you what's 
the best show I've seen the sopranos 

4233
03:19:27,990 --> 03:19:28,823
about.
Lastly,

4234
03:19:28,850 --> 03:19:30,880
fucking whatever.
You're going to hate it.

4235
03:19:31,330 --> 03:19:34,480
People going to hate it.
It's a show called Selia.

4236
03:19:34,930 --> 03:19:37,380
Selia celly.
It's above Selia cruise.

4237
03:19:37,440 --> 03:19:39,550
The Cuban singer.
How do you spell it?

4238
03:19:39,880 --> 03:19:44,880
C E L I a what's it on?
It's on Netflix.

4239
03:19:45,200 --> 03:19:46,620
Somebody called me and said,
Joe,

4240
03:19:46,621 --> 03:19:49,120
you tube and no disrespect.
You should watch that show.

4241
03:19:49,380 --> 03:19:50,213
I W I knew Selia crews,
like my mom had the bar in the early 

4242
03:19:55,870 --> 03:19:56,681
seventies.
My mom was tired,

4243
03:19:56,681 --> 03:19:57,514
that was Selia,
but I was going to Catholic school so 

4244
03:19:59,231 --> 03:20:00,064
whenever she came by I wasn't there.
I would see her at the bar and I had 

4245
03:20:02,861 --> 03:20:05,600
seen her a few times but I didn't know 
much of what I like,

4246
03:20:05,601 --> 03:20:09,790
like three songs and Cuba.
She's like a folk lore like this fucking

4247
03:20:09,791 --> 03:20:14,110
like be people in Cuba.
What is she like a waste?

4248
03:20:14,111 --> 03:20:17,770
I watched this fucking show and I'm up 
to episode 30.

4249
03:20:17,830 --> 03:20:18,663
Okay.
And they taped it like a Spanish 

4250
03:20:20,531 --> 03:20:21,550
novella.
Right.

4251
03:20:21,551 --> 03:20:22,384
Which again,
nobody really liked it unless you grew 

4252
03:20:24,311 --> 03:20:25,144
up on Spanish novellus,
but it fills you in on what was going 

4253
03:20:29,741 --> 03:20:30,010
on.

4254
03:20:30,010 --> 03:20:32,260
Like she goes,
like right now,

4255
03:20:32,320 --> 03:20:35,530
Castro just took her fucking house.
So when you say she taped,

4256
03:20:35,560 --> 03:20:38,470
they taped like a Spanish novella.
You mean like Telemundo?

4257
03:20:38,471 --> 03:20:40,420
Novella.
But they made this into a TV show,

4258
03:20:40,480 --> 03:20:43,510
80 fucken episodes.
I'm up to 33,

4259
03:20:43,540 --> 03:20:46,420
80 episodes.
Eight episodes the first season.

4260
03:20:46,900 --> 03:20:47,733
I don't know what it is.
I just find somebody called me and turn 

4261
03:20:49,581 --> 03:20:52,150
me onto it.
But it's not that interesting.

4262
03:20:52,151 --> 03:20:52,984
Like the singing is cool and I remember 
growing up and listening to some of 

4263
03:20:56,471 --> 03:20:57,304
those songs and my mom is ball.
What's going on as they break down the 

4264
03:21:01,390 --> 03:21:03,190
gay thing in Cuba,
what I told you,

4265
03:21:03,530 --> 03:21:05,740
they used to take them shark island 
thing and throw him off the boat.

4266
03:21:06,400 --> 03:21:09,970
Like this fucking kid was saying my 
father left the house because I was gay.

4267
03:21:09,971 --> 03:21:12,880
Like it was so taboo when if you were 
dark skinned,

4268
03:21:13,630 --> 03:21:16,300
like if you were any dark skin at all in
Cuba,

4269
03:21:16,720 --> 03:21:17,710
they would hate you.

4270
03:21:17,710 --> 03:21:21,340
Joe Rogen so when Castro got in there 
and made it easier,

4271
03:21:21,370 --> 03:21:25,120
but Tiesta was robin people,
but Pisa was just a piece of shit.

4272
03:21:25,390 --> 03:21:26,223
I mean,
but these two were such a piece of shit 

4273
03:21:27,820 --> 03:21:28,653
that 20 years after he was gone,
they were hunting down his soldiers in 

4274
03:21:31,841 --> 03:21:34,990
the United States like fucking Nazi 
soldiers.

4275
03:21:35,380 --> 03:21:38,140
Like they would get hunted down.
These groups of Cubans were hunting them

4276
03:21:38,141 --> 03:21:40,450
down and fucking beat them and shooting 
them and shit.

4277
03:21:40,930 --> 03:21:44,170
That's how much.
Because it had become like it.

4278
03:21:44,290 --> 03:21:46,880
Towards the last five years of Cuba 
become like,

4279
03:21:46,881 --> 03:21:48,610
if I pulled you over,
I just beat you,

4280
03:21:48,650 --> 03:21:50,870
fucked up.
Took your car and that was it.

4281
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:53,090
But for eight years,
Cuba,

4282
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:54,103
Fidel sat in those mountains.
It's like taken over La and sending up 

4283
03:21:58,941 --> 03:22:03,350
and fucking San Francisco for eight 
years waiting for the opportunity and it

4284
03:22:03,351 --> 03:22:05,300
breaks it down along the way how they.

4285
03:22:05,690 --> 03:22:09,410
It was easy for them to take home.
It was like stealing for.

4286
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:11,930
They were waiting for fidelity to take 
over the revolution.

4287
03:22:12,020 --> 03:22:13,580
It is pretty crazy.
He's still in control.

4288
03:22:13,610 --> 03:22:15,720
It's fucking crazy.
I mean this real,

4289
03:22:15,721 --> 03:22:16,680
you know,
and I knew this,

4290
03:22:16,810 --> 03:22:19,070
anybody like that out there now besides 
him,

4291
03:22:19,100 --> 03:22:19,933
that,
that took a country by force and still 

4292
03:22:21,681 --> 03:22:24,060
has control of it all these years later.
Oh,

4293
03:22:24,061 --> 03:22:26,400
he just wanted to people's houses and 
said,

4294
03:22:26,401 --> 03:22:27,234
that's my,
you know,

4295
03:22:27,260 --> 03:22:32,260
this show doesn't touch on the casinos,
but he walked into the casinos and said,

4296
03:22:34,290 --> 03:22:35,570
go ahead,
call the mafia.

4297
03:22:36,340 --> 03:22:39,860
It's mine.
You show them.

4298
03:22:39,861 --> 03:22:40,694
They show the Cubans,
take him to all the American embassy 

4299
03:22:43,671 --> 03:22:45,610
people.
What they do to them.

4300
03:22:45,810 --> 03:22:48,170
Just took him on the arm and walked into
the airport.

4301
03:22:48,610 --> 03:22:50,200
I have a nice life.
Wow.

4302
03:22:51,380 --> 03:22:53,780
You know,
they nationalized all the businesses.

4303
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:57,680
It was just something that you don't 
think about.

4304
03:22:57,680 --> 03:22:59,050
I don't think about it.
You know,

4305
03:22:59,051 --> 03:23:00,350
I'm,
I'm Americanized.

4306
03:23:00,351 --> 03:23:04,680
Whatever the fuck.
But it is the acting sensation.

4307
03:23:04,681 --> 03:23:06,860
It's just a little too much music.
Like you.

4308
03:23:06,950 --> 03:23:09,020
It's subtitles.
It's all Spanish.

4309
03:23:09,110 --> 03:23:11,030
When she,
you say that she was huge in Cuba.

4310
03:23:11,031 --> 03:23:11,864
Like all.
She was huge worldwide compared to 

4311
03:23:14,301 --> 03:23:15,134
someone up today.
Like what would you compare it to when 

4312
03:23:16,171 --> 03:23:18,720
they use this?
When used in 1956,

4313
03:23:18,721 --> 03:23:20,670
she had her first gold out.
Holy Shit.

4314
03:23:20,671 --> 03:23:21,590
That's a million,
right?

4315
03:23:21,710 --> 03:23:24,500
Yeah.
And now go is gold a 500,000

4316
03:23:24,710 --> 03:23:29,590
and a million and the people,
the owner of the company had to call the

4317
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:32,060
fucking wreck.
Bandleader over and go,

4318
03:23:32,420 --> 03:23:36,500
we can't have this check though.
She's a darkie arc is don't sell records

4319
03:23:36,501 --> 03:23:37,334
in Cuba and that going to do it.
And he guaranteed them because you ever 

4320
03:23:39,921 --> 03:23:41,080
talk like that.
I get a knock.

4321
03:23:41,090 --> 03:23:44,510
You the fuck out.
But if it goes gold,

4322
03:23:44,720 --> 03:23:46,310
you pay for the studio sessions.

4323
03:23:46,340 --> 03:23:47,260
If it doesn't go,
go,

4324
03:23:47,310 --> 03:23:52,250
let pam guarantee she became one of the 
biggest actresses that actresses are not

4325
03:23:52,251 --> 03:23:54,200
the best looking fucking monster out 
there.

4326
03:23:54,260 --> 03:23:55,900
I mean,
that was her argument also.

4327
03:23:56,150 --> 03:23:58,010
She was Haitian,
she was Cuban,

4328
03:23:58,870 --> 03:24:00,580
she was Haitian.
I don't know.

4329
03:24:01,780 --> 03:24:04,580
She probably had nation blood,
whatever the fuck it is,

4330
03:24:04,581 --> 03:24:07,080
but she was fucking Cuban.
But uh,

4331
03:24:08,030 --> 03:24:08,863
you know,
they said she wouldn't sell records 

4332
03:24:09,651 --> 03:24:10,484
because she was ugly.
She wouldn't sell records because she 

4333
03:24:12,861 --> 03:24:16,370
was dark skinned.
Like her actual music and the show.

4334
03:24:16,630 --> 03:24:17,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

4335
03:24:17,600 --> 03:24:19,820
And her singing and shit.
It's pretty fucking intense.

4336
03:24:20,210 --> 03:24:22,160
But it showed like three star goals for 
her,

4337
03:24:22,161 --> 03:24:24,900
like she wasn't going to make it as a 
fucking dark thing.

4338
03:24:24,901 --> 03:24:25,940
Uh,
you know,

4339
03:24:25,941 --> 03:24:27,560
they show like what Cuba was going 
through,

4340
03:24:27,561 --> 03:24:29,900
like when Fidel fucking goes into a 
house.

4341
03:24:30,680 --> 03:24:31,513
And now the last episode I watched you 
supposed to go perform at the Tropicana 

4342
03:24:35,300 --> 03:24:38,520
for the Common Dante,
you know,

4343
03:24:38,750 --> 03:24:40,550
and she's like,
he took my house,

4344
03:24:40,610 --> 03:24:42,590
now he wants me to go perform from 
buckhead.

4345
03:24:42,680 --> 03:24:44,910
I'm not going down there,
but she's done that.

4346
03:24:44,911 --> 03:24:47,840
He's done that with Shay Guevara,
you know,

4347
03:24:47,850 --> 03:24:50,670
and all that shit.
So that's the last episode I watched.

4348
03:24:50,730 --> 03:24:52,770
That was it,
but check that out.

4349
03:24:53,340 --> 03:24:55,320
Episodes of that scares the shit out of 
me now.

4350
03:24:55,410 --> 03:24:57,450
Joe Rogan,
that kind of time,

4351
03:24:57,480 --> 03:24:59,740
you'll watch two episodes in bail.
It's just,

4352
03:25:00,470 --> 03:25:02,280
it's kind of different.
It's different.

4353
03:25:02,310 --> 03:25:04,200
Even for me it was a little different at
first.

4354
03:25:04,590 --> 03:25:05,423
I,
I stuck with it because I grew up in it 

4355
03:25:06,741 --> 03:25:08,960
and I kind of missed that.
Right now I don't have my parents.

4356
03:25:08,970 --> 03:25:12,090
I kind of missed that.
It's constantly in Spanish.

4357
03:25:12,540 --> 03:25:14,250
It's really good.
Cuban actors,

4358
03:25:14,280 --> 03:25:17,060
there's a couple Mexicans.
There's a couple fucking uh,

4359
03:25:17,680 --> 03:25:18,870
you know,
like light skin,

4360
03:25:18,871 --> 03:25:19,601
Mexico,
Julian.

4361
03:25:19,601 --> 03:25:22,080
We know that Mexicans to talked about 
Cuba and the fifties.

4362
03:25:22,081 --> 03:25:24,870
What Cuba was in the fifties are you 
like in Narcos?

4363
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:27,780
I liked it.
I liked both seasons.

4364
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:30,150
Pretty good.
Uh,

4365
03:25:30,740 --> 03:25:31,573
it was great.

4366
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:34,270
I love that fucking show.
Did you get enough of that show?

4367
03:25:34,600 --> 03:25:35,433
Did you watch both seasons?
I haven't finished the second season 

4368
03:25:37,621 --> 03:25:39,400
yet.
I'm halfway season.

4369
03:25:40,510 --> 03:25:41,280
Yeah.
I loved it.

4370
03:25:41,280 --> 03:25:43,290
Loved the first season.
I'm halfway into the second season,

4371
03:25:43,291 --> 03:25:44,124
but then I found stranger things and I 
went off on a tangent and I had a watch 

4372
03:25:46,951 --> 03:25:48,870
that I had to ride that motherfucker 
right to the end.

4373
03:25:48,871 --> 03:25:49,830
I love that show.

4374
03:25:50,180 --> 03:25:52,370
There's a lot of good shows,
a lot of good shows out there.

4375
03:25:52,460 --> 03:25:57,160
West world,
Anthony Hopkins,

4376
03:25:58,010 --> 03:25:58,843
Ed Harris,
and Harris has always been a bad mother 

4377
03:26:01,510 --> 03:26:02,160
fucker.
Fuck.

4378
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:05,160
But this is is a piece Talese lazy 
sauce.

4379
03:26:05,220 --> 03:26:06,053
This is the one.
This is the role where you know you're 

4380
03:26:08,101 --> 03:26:10,350
going to see him a lot because you know 
it's many,

4381
03:26:10,351 --> 03:26:11,550
many,
many episodes.

4382
03:26:11,670 --> 03:26:12,503
So it's like the.
The beautiful thing about game of 

4383
03:26:13,711 --> 03:26:18,180
thrones is that it's a giant movie.
It's a movie that lasts many,

4384
03:26:18,181 --> 03:26:18,661
many,
many,

4385
03:26:18,661 --> 03:26:21,090
many seasons and once you get used to 
that,

4386
03:26:21,091 --> 03:26:21,924
a regular movies like it's not enough 
time to tell a story 90 minutes and not 

4387
03:26:25,561 --> 03:26:26,394
enough time to tell a story and you're 
seeing that with shows like westworld 

4388
03:26:28,921 --> 03:26:31,350
too.
It's like they're figuring out a totally

4389
03:26:31,351 --> 03:26:33,720
new thing and it totally new thing 
being.

4390
03:26:33,870 --> 03:26:34,703
There's been shows before,
like last and a bunch of other shows 

4391
03:26:36,451 --> 03:26:39,060
where there was a storyline they had to 
follow through the entire,

4392
03:26:39,290 --> 03:26:40,123
you know,
all seasons and they all kind of 

4393
03:26:41,161 --> 03:26:44,160
connected but not sort of the way 
they're doing it now.

4394
03:26:44,310 --> 03:26:45,143
The way they're doing it now is with 
nudity and swearing and violence and 

4395
03:26:48,091 --> 03:26:51,810
sexuality and it's just,
it's all no holds barred.

4396
03:26:51,811 --> 03:26:52,644
I mean,
game of thrones is changed the whole 

4397
03:26:53,401 --> 03:26:56,940
fucking game and now westworld is 
changing the game too.

4398
03:26:56,970 --> 03:26:57,803
There's a bunch of these shows like that
that are just hbo and Netflix and you 

4399
03:27:02,601 --> 03:27:05,130
know,
all these companies that have the budget

4400
03:27:05,131 --> 03:27:05,964
to put together essentially a movie a 
week and they get these banging actors 

4401
03:27:09,811 --> 03:27:12,930
and I'm telling you,
Ed Harris knocks it out of the park.

4402
03:27:13,140 --> 03:27:15,630
He's so creepy.
He's so creepy.

4403
03:27:15,631 --> 03:27:18,180
You believe a man,
you believe he's the boogeyman.

4404
03:27:18,870 --> 03:27:19,703
I keep.
If you were living in those wild west 

4405
03:27:20,941 --> 03:27:24,900
days and Ed Harris Rides up in a fucking
horse outside your town with that creepy

4406
03:27:24,901 --> 03:27:27,990
fucking smile of his.
He can't even kill them.

4407
03:27:28,600 --> 03:27:31,770
Big Guns don't work on him.
Fuck man.

4408
03:27:32,310 --> 03:27:34,410
It's awesome.
Such a good show.

4409
03:27:34,820 --> 03:27:37,640
I didn't have enough.
Joey Diaz speaking.

4410
03:27:37,660 --> 03:27:38,400
A good show,
Jill.

4411
03:27:38,400 --> 03:27:39,233
We did is.
I heard you had a good show in Chicago 

4412
03:27:39,871 --> 03:27:41,740
and I hope we're get hurt.
We're going to be to see that shit on

4413
03:27:42,400 --> 03:27:46,790
December eighth bitches.
You were a adzenys right?

4414
03:27:46,830 --> 03:27:49,450
The Rosemont Rosemont.
That's a great club.

4415
03:27:49,590 --> 03:27:51,590
Just a fun place club.
Uh,

4416
03:27:51,790 --> 03:27:52,623
Eddie Bravo said he saw you down there.
He said he had a great fucking time 

4417
03:27:54,750 --> 03:27:55,583
Friday night.
We had a good time and then sadly the 

4418
03:27:56,831 --> 03:27:57,664
first show was a little lumpy,
but the second show I just got out of 

4419
03:28:00,661 --> 03:28:01,031
my,
you know,

4420
03:28:01,031 --> 03:28:01,864
I,
I was trying,

4421
03:28:02,140 --> 03:28:05,920
I was trying to be Jerry Seinfeld and I 
had a script really for the first show.

4422
03:28:05,921 --> 03:28:06,754
Yeah.
I was going to stick this just because 

4423
03:28:07,391 --> 03:28:10,030
it's a taping was the first time I had 
the opportunity.

4424
03:28:10,031 --> 03:28:11,590
I was going to try to work a little 
cleaner.

4425
03:28:11,650 --> 03:28:12,483
I didn't want them to.
I didn't want them to look at me and 

4426
03:28:15,461 --> 03:28:16,240
say,
this guy,

4427
03:28:16,240 --> 03:28:18,490
you know,
I tell you why I'm a fan of MMA.

4428
03:28:18,550 --> 03:28:21,150
When I see growth,
I love when I watch it,

4429
03:28:21,220 --> 03:28:22,053
I'm in a fight.

4430
03:28:22,330 --> 03:28:25,180
When economy,
rego fought Nick Diaz the second time,

4431
03:28:25,720 --> 03:28:26,553
I was so happy that I finally,
somebody is doing what I'm talking 

4432
03:28:28,841 --> 03:28:30,160
about.
You go back,

4433
03:28:30,161 --> 03:28:30,994
you look at your mistakes and you go 
back to and correct them at the same 

4434
03:28:32,921 --> 03:28:34,990
time.
You show up with a new weapon.

4435
03:28:35,320 --> 03:28:36,153
Don't keep telling me that you're the 
hardest hitter in the UFC lightweight 

4436
03:28:38,321 --> 03:28:39,154
division.
I don't want to hear that because it's 

4437
03:28:40,001 --> 03:28:42,790
not about the hardest headed.
I don't want to hear that no more.

4438
03:28:42,791 --> 03:28:46,150
So I thought about my special from that 
perspective and I go,

4439
03:28:46,151 --> 03:28:48,840
if I watch my special,
if I do come on the foot joke.

4440
03:28:48,841 --> 03:28:51,040
They're gonna know he never grew from.
They never really.

4441
03:28:51,430 --> 03:28:53,800
So I really wanted to try it.
You know what I'm saying?

4442
03:28:53,801 --> 03:28:54,634
Like,
but see that's they fuck with your head 

4443
03:28:56,421 --> 03:28:58,710
band because those come in,
the foot jokes are great.

4444
03:28:58,710 --> 03:28:59,650
No,
I don't like them.

4445
03:28:59,651 --> 03:29:02,050
I just don't want to kill time and I'm 
lazy,

4446
03:29:02,650 --> 03:29:06,460
but I just wanted to do something that 
was me but not.

4447
03:29:07,150 --> 03:29:07,983
So I worked at that way,
the first ride tried to be Jerry 

4448
03:29:10,540 --> 03:29:12,130
Seinfeld and it kind of worked a little 
bit.

4449
03:29:12,200 --> 03:29:14,920
The technique was there,
but the old business wasn't.

4450
03:29:14,921 --> 03:29:17,290
Then I thought about the and I said,
fuck this.

4451
03:29:17,710 --> 03:29:18,543
I'm going to change this all up.
I'm going to go out this motherfucker 

4452
03:29:20,660 --> 03:29:25,660
Capello.
So second fellow human that's been their

4453
03:29:26,900 --> 03:29:28,810
management order.
No order,

4454
03:29:28,811 --> 03:29:32,560
no nothing.
I Capello whatever the jokes.

4455
03:29:32,561 --> 03:29:34,360
I didn't want to use old jokes,
nothing like that.

4456
03:29:34,361 --> 03:29:36,640
It was all fresh stuff and it worked 
out,

4457
03:29:36,641 --> 03:29:38,770
man.
I'm happy I did it 25 years.

4458
03:29:39,160 --> 03:29:40,960
It's done.
You know what we should do next?

4459
03:29:40,961 --> 03:29:42,480
It's going to take another one.
You know,

4460
03:29:42,490 --> 03:29:43,323
we should do next.
We should do like a Rodney dangerfield 

4461
03:29:45,431 --> 03:29:46,264
special type thing with all of us with 
like red and you and Duncan and put it 

4462
03:29:51,581 --> 03:29:54,820
together and you know,
and do the same.

4463
03:29:54,820 --> 03:29:57,670
The way that Ronnie's still,
where they have like four or five comics

4464
03:29:57,671 --> 03:30:00,370
go on and do like 15 minutes,
you know,

4465
03:30:01,230 --> 03:30:02,063
you know sometimes that gets stuck with 
comedy and I go back to those in my 

4466
03:30:04,901 --> 03:30:08,590
world.
It was a great Kennison on their dice,

4467
03:30:08,591 --> 03:30:09,424
on their bill.
Hicks taught me an education because 

4468
03:30:12,660 --> 03:30:13,493
fucking Andrew went up there and leveled
the room level level I would have ran 

4469
03:30:16,931 --> 03:30:17,764
out of that.
Andrew dice clay and Bill Hicks went up 

4470
03:30:20,351 --> 03:30:24,220
there with the composure,
slow them down with a cigarette,

4471
03:30:24,490 --> 03:30:27,040
smooth as a cucumber,
socked him in dark,

4472
03:30:27,041 --> 03:30:32,041
cool as a cucumber.
Suck them into a web of fucking are with

4473
03:30:32,141 --> 03:30:33,520
it.
Turned into something else.

4474
03:30:34,090 --> 03:30:37,950
A shop boy.
Schimmel destroyed that dom.

4475
03:30:37,951 --> 03:30:40,250
I rarer and Clark

4476
03:30:40,260 --> 03:30:41,093
and Clark droid it crushed always been 
my go to when I'm fucking up with stand 

4477
03:30:45,710 --> 03:30:50,710
up and Seinfeld Seinfeld fucked it up.
There was a couple of great people that.

4478
03:30:52,280 --> 03:30:53,510
Who else?
Robert Townsend.

4479
03:30:53,850 --> 03:30:55,490
Roseanne Barr?
Yeah.

4480
03:30:56,300 --> 03:30:59,510
Yeah.
Barry Sobel.

4481
03:30:59,540 --> 03:31:01,700
Barry Sobel.
That's a leather jacket on,

4482
03:31:01,701 --> 03:31:03,050
right?
Barry Sobel.

4483
03:31:03,051 --> 03:31:04,730
Who went on to being punchline.
Yeah.

4484
03:31:04,731 --> 03:31:06,170
We really should do that.
Joey,

4485
03:31:06,230 --> 03:31:08,290
why don't we do that?
That should be our next thing.

4486
03:31:08,320 --> 03:31:09,510
Set it up.
Yeah,

4487
03:31:09,830 --> 03:31:11,450
we could do that.
Yeah,

4488
03:31:11,451 --> 03:31:14,000
and do it that way.
We could do another special quick,

4489
03:31:14,210 --> 03:31:17,900
like you do this special.
Then we can do another one in like seven

4490
03:31:17,901 --> 03:31:18,734
or eight months or something like that.
We'd all have 20 solid minutes at seven 

4491
03:31:21,531 --> 03:31:23,150
or eight months.
We could throw on another show.

4492
03:31:23,300 --> 03:31:26,270
This is tremendous edibles.
Fuck No.

4493
03:31:26,470 --> 03:31:28,400
Why?
Because even if it don't get your high,

4494
03:31:28,790 --> 03:31:31,010
your breadth is fucking minty fresh.
After that.

4495
03:31:31,100 --> 03:31:33,590
It feels good and my mom tastes great 
mind to.

4496
03:31:34,400 --> 03:31:35,233
So it's on Seeso and isn't there 
something where you can sign up for 

4497
03:31:37,821 --> 03:31:38,750
free?
Yeah,

4498
03:31:38,751 --> 03:31:41,150
I got a cold day.
I listened to the podcast and I give out

4499
03:31:41,151 --> 03:31:44,140
the CSO coding to get two free months.
I'll give it to you.

4500
03:31:44,180 --> 03:31:45,013
November 25th.
So you got until January as you get the 

4501
03:31:47,541 --> 03:31:49,520
special fucking free.
Come on,

4502
03:31:49,540 --> 03:31:51,860
Joel Diaz.
Doug Stan hope is on.

4503
03:31:51,880 --> 03:31:54,470
That's right.
They're doing some other stuff too.

4504
03:31:54,471 --> 03:31:55,350
I've designed that.
Oh,

4505
03:31:55,351 --> 03:31:58,250
they shoot a ton of shit.
They're going to be the official comedy.

4506
03:31:58,251 --> 03:32:01,000
They want to go for it.
They want to go for it and they want,

4507
03:32:01,060 --> 03:32:01,851
well,
you know what,

4508
03:32:01,851 --> 03:32:04,160
I think these,
all these new networks are going to open

4509
03:32:04,161 --> 03:32:06,500
up the same way that Netflix has done.
It's going to.

4510
03:32:06,520 --> 03:32:07,353
It's obviously a very,
very good model and they're realizing 

4511
03:32:09,501 --> 03:32:11,480
that now that's going to be the future.

4512
03:32:11,480 --> 03:32:14,810
It's these networks like CBS and NBC and
ABC.

4513
03:32:15,140 --> 03:32:15,973
Boy,
they're going to have a hard time in a 

4514
03:32:17,210 --> 03:32:18,090
few years staying afloat.
Well,

4515
03:32:18,091 --> 03:32:19,940
let's think about it.
What's Netflix?

4516
03:32:21,440 --> 03:32:23,500
How much a month?
Nine bucks.

4517
03:32:23,540 --> 03:32:25,930
Nine bucks.
Three $99 for CSO.

4518
03:32:25,960 --> 03:32:29,360
CSO is only going to be a sports one.
That's going to be like $2.

4519
03:32:29,720 --> 03:32:30,553
Pretty soon you're going to be spending 
$21 and you're going to get programming 

4520
03:32:34,041 --> 03:32:35,230
from fucking Mars.
Yeah.

4521
03:32:35,830 --> 03:32:37,610
What does he have?
What's on it?

4522
03:32:38,090 --> 03:32:41,660
They have a small office.
It's an NBC thing.

4523
03:32:42,500 --> 03:32:44,630
NBC,
so they've got everything.

4524
03:32:44,650 --> 03:32:47,250
NBC,
he was all 40 years Saturn,

4525
03:32:47,260 --> 03:32:52,260
live side that live and see all,
but I guess they will.

4526
03:32:52,421 --> 03:32:53,660
They're starting.
Yeah,

4527
03:32:53,661 --> 03:32:55,850
I guess they went after a lot of 
comedians.

4528
03:32:55,851 --> 03:32:58,040
Specials is already doing this thing on 
Seeso.

4529
03:32:58,130 --> 03:32:58,963
I'm not sure.
They have like original networking on 

4530
03:33:01,671 --> 03:33:03,500
them,
like original programming network.

4531
03:33:03,501 --> 03:33:04,910
You know what the fuck I'm talking 
about.

4532
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:07,370
That's awesome.
It's tremendous.

4533
03:33:07,400 --> 03:33:09,430
Well I think that's the future.
The future is those.

4534
03:33:09,500 --> 03:33:11,740
I mean like Netflix didn't become 
netflix overnight.

4535
03:33:11,750 --> 03:33:13,840
There was something I was watching 
online with.

4536
03:33:13,841 --> 03:33:17,540
This guy was talking about big companies
and companies to look for and you know,

4537
03:33:17,541 --> 03:33:20,570
it was companies like Google and apple 
and big technology companies.

4538
03:33:20,590 --> 03:33:23,630
Anything that Netflix is going to be one
of the next big technology companies.

4539
03:33:23,631 --> 03:33:24,464
You look at the growth and we'll get 
what it's worth now and what it's 

4540
03:33:26,121 --> 03:33:26,954
projected to be worth like in 2020 and 
it's like it just keeps growing and 

4541
03:33:29,991 --> 03:33:30,824
growing and as more and more people 
abandoned cable like less and less 

4542
03:33:34,101 --> 03:33:34,934
people are getting cable.
More and more people are getting their 

4543
03:33:36,681 --> 03:33:37,514
TV from Netflix and you know,
the thing is the idea of watching 

4544
03:33:41,881 --> 03:33:44,520
something.
You have to be home at 8:00

4545
03:33:44,521 --> 03:33:45,780
and going to be sitting there waiting.

4546
03:33:45,960 --> 03:33:49,020
It seems archaic.
It seems archaic to wait for a show.

4547
03:33:49,470 --> 03:33:53,340
And what Netflix also does to get you in
turn you into a junkie is they.

4548
03:33:53,341 --> 03:33:54,174
You could just binge.
He could just sit there and watch all 

4549
03:33:56,131 --> 03:33:58,230
the narcos episodes.
Just sit there.

4550
03:33:58,650 --> 03:34:02,870
I'll come home with a knife.
We don't stand up to unwind the watching

4551
03:34:02,910 --> 03:34:06,540
an episode of fucking fuck.
Yeah.

4552
03:34:06,600 --> 03:34:08,100
I liked that.
Bestowed seven.

4553
03:34:08,190 --> 03:34:09,023
That's all.
That's been one of my favorite episodes 

4554
03:34:10,561 --> 03:34:14,430
of television the last 20 years.
Episode Seven.

4555
03:34:14,431 --> 03:34:15,264
Law as Pinata.
I don't know what was when he kills the 

4556
03:34:17,941 --> 03:34:21,770
two guys and puts them in the oven the 
first season to the arts.

4557
03:34:21,771 --> 03:34:24,040
Who was driving the stealing from him 
and Gada.

4558
03:34:24,300 --> 03:34:25,133
That was dark when he did that episode.
That's when I knew we were onto some 

4559
03:34:28,651 --> 03:34:29,484
fucking.
His acting is fucking second to none 

4560
03:34:31,831 --> 03:34:34,210
right now.
That duke is out act motherfuckers.

4561
03:34:34,710 --> 03:34:37,240
He's a skinny dude that walks fat.
I've never seen that.

4562
03:34:37,290 --> 03:34:39,240
What he put on a lot of weight for that 
role,

4563
03:34:39,970 --> 03:34:41,970
that role.
I've never seen that shit.

4564
03:34:42,180 --> 03:34:42,990
Yeah,
you buy it.

4565
03:34:42,990 --> 03:34:44,010
You buy.
He who?

4566
03:34:44,020 --> 03:34:44,801
He,
you know,

4567
03:34:44,801 --> 03:34:47,130
he's pretending to be a good fucking 
show.

4568
03:34:47,640 --> 03:34:49,680
There's a lot of good stuff out there 
these days,

4569
03:34:49,980 --> 03:34:52,620
but Joey Diaz is on Seeso,
December eighth.

4570
03:34:52,621 --> 03:34:53,454
Motherfuckers.
What's it called when you calling it 

4571
03:34:55,950 --> 03:34:57,660
sociably.
Unacceptable.

4572
03:34:57,750 --> 03:34:59,400
Sociably.
Unacceptable.

4573
03:35:01,350 --> 03:35:02,183
Socially or sociably?
I have no fucking idea what the 

4574
03:35:05,550 --> 03:35:06,990
questions.
Just go.

4575
03:35:07,010 --> 03:35:10,230
The Cecil December right now.
Might change the title by that time.

4576
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:12,810
So it's A.
Have you edited it all?

4577
03:35:13,260 --> 03:35:14,430
Yeah,
I got a couple of edits.

4578
03:35:14,431 --> 03:35:15,990
It looks fucking tremendous.
Beautiful.

4579
03:35:16,170 --> 03:35:17,430
Um,
so um,

4580
03:35:17,460 --> 03:35:19,200
when they put it up you can just stream 
it live,

4581
03:35:19,201 --> 03:35:21,570
right?
It's just awesome.

4582
03:35:21,780 --> 03:35:22,613
And then again,
if you want to get on and get on it now 

4583
03:35:24,841 --> 03:35:28,530
because Doug Stanhope is already on 
Seeso and you can check out his thing to

4584
03:35:28,800 --> 03:35:30,270
Joey's is December eighth.

4585
03:35:30,270 --> 03:35:34,590
I'll definitely have you on before them.
We'll let her know for pops up and we're

4586
03:35:34,591 --> 03:35:39,591
doing new year's Eve motherfuckers.
Home of Ebi with Tony Golden Pony.

4587
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:44,430
Hinchcliffe A.
I think it's almost sold out.

4588
03:35:44,490 --> 03:35:46,860
There was a very,
I think there less than 100 tickets left

4589
03:35:47,040 --> 03:35:49,290
as of this week.
So don't sleep.

4590
03:35:49,320 --> 03:35:51,300
You know,
I came up here to promote something,

4591
03:35:51,301 --> 03:35:53,130
but what is it on the way up here?
They were like,

4592
03:35:53,131 --> 03:35:54,720
Joey,
there's only 60 tickets.

4593
03:35:55,210 --> 03:35:57,200
I didn't know.
I thought that.

4594
03:35:57,300 --> 03:35:58,133
What is it,
the willow when you're doing the Wilbur 

4595
03:36:00,600 --> 03:36:02,160
November 11th.
Oh Shit.

4596
03:36:02,190 --> 03:36:03,023
Well let them know if you're in Boston.
That's fucking theater is one of the 

4597
03:36:06,391 --> 03:36:07,224
best theaters to see stand up because 
it's three tiers and it's stacked right 

4598
03:36:10,231 --> 03:36:12,600
in front of you.
So it's a big ass crowd,

4599
03:36:12,601 --> 03:36:13,434
but it feels like a small crowd because 
each it's like there's three small 

4600
03:36:16,501 --> 03:36:17,630
crowds that sort.

4601
03:36:17,630 --> 03:36:18,463
It's like it's like three,
300 seat comedy clubs stacked on top of 

4602
03:36:21,271 --> 03:36:22,104
each other.
Places got foxwoods and even that night 

4603
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:26,940
was selling tickets.
I was like,

4604
03:36:26,941 --> 03:36:28,990
that let's just bail on it because it's 
UFC.

4605
03:36:29,030 --> 03:36:29,880
See Two,
oh five.

4606
03:36:29,910 --> 03:36:32,550
Everybody's little watch UFC 205.
They're like,

4607
03:36:32,580 --> 03:36:33,660
no,
we're selling tickets.

4608
03:36:33,661 --> 03:36:34,470
I said,
okay,

4609
03:36:34,470 --> 03:36:38,260
well if people could stay off their 
fucking phones and just hit that Dvr and

4610
03:36:38,261 --> 03:36:41,080
just la La la La la and not listened to 
the radio is a drive home,

4611
03:36:41,090 --> 03:36:41,751
blah blah,
blah,

4612
03:36:41,751 --> 03:36:43,810
blah blah.
And then get in front of the TV.

4613
03:36:43,811 --> 03:36:46,210
They can watch it like as if it was a 
live event.

4614
03:36:46,211 --> 03:36:48,220
So they could see you.
And then go watch the fights.

4615
03:36:49,170 --> 03:36:51,670
This motherfucker's all right folks.
That's it.

4616
03:36:51,760 --> 03:36:53,650
That's the end.
That's the end for this week.

4617
03:36:53,680 --> 03:36:54,513
I'm going out of town.
I got to go kill some deers with bows 

4618
03:36:56,621 --> 03:36:59,080
and arrows.
See a deer.

4619
03:36:59,170 --> 03:37:02,520
No S and a be back soon.
Bye.

4620
03:37:02,560 --> 03:37:04,480
Love you guys.
Shit at it.
