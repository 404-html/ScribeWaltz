1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,750
So let's go back to
when the power went out,

3
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:03,931
man,

4
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:05,070
we were talking about Hicks.

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:05,880
Um,

6
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,631
you guys,

7
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:06,870
uh,

8
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,990
put Hicks on a,

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,190
you thanked him on a CD because
you got ahold of one of his,

10
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:11,460
uh,

11
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,380
cassettes and you enjoyed it and,

12
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:13,951
but you never,

13
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:15,480
you guys never actually toured together,

14
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,280
but you can't close to
what we planned on it.

15
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,360
It was basically a plan.

16
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,200
We were kind of setting
into motion in like mid 93,

17
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,390
uh,

18
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,240
losing our talking and
that's when it's time when,

19
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:27,450
when he came down and that was kind
of part of why he was coming down.

20
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:28,770
We're trying to figure out
what we were going to do.

21
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,800
Comedians and rock musicians like that.

22
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,041
It's a,

23
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,870
it's a weird combination of bobcat.

24
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,700
Goldthwait did a lot of,

25
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:35,881
uh,

26
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,020
work with Nirvana.

27
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,891
He opened up for them.

28
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,890
We have him in here and he told
some hilarious stories about the,

29
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,120
of just fucking Hawkin Shit
at him screaming at him
and fucking murder in their

30
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,900
eyes.

31
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,070
I'll fucking stay.

32
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,550
Meanwhile,

33
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,070
he's friends with that when
they want him to go out there.

34
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,061
It's like,

35
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:51,331
yeah,

36
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:51,790
like I,

37
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,940
I actually approached the David
Cross a couple of years ago.

38
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:54,211
Hey man,

39
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,050
we're going to do another shake.

40
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,923
No,

41
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,960
I would say no to.

42
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,220
I wouldn't want to.

43
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,521
Yeah,

44
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,660
you don't want to eat dick
in front of a rock crowd.

45
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,271
It's just,

46
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,710
it's not right it with coins and stuff.

47
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,540
It was all sort of weird combination.

48
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,460
It's like you're not providing
them what they're there to see you.

49
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,520
You've got attorney me might work.

50
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,670
I've seen guys do it and pull it
off and they can work with it.

51
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:15,530
Works with poster for,

52
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,710
yeah cause it's just,

53
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,390
it's just that the nature of that project.

54
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,224
Cause it's silly.

55
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,140
It's just a,

56
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,840
there's just all this
different stuff going on.

57
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,920
You've got film and you've got,

58
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,240
you've got video and you've got animation.

59
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,580
You've got the one too where we had
a Neil hamburger opened up for us.

60
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,700
That's awesome.

61
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:30,940
You know,

62
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,470
so that's just,

63
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,840
and then in the middle of our study
would come out and interrupt and go,

64
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,800
I forgot a joke.

65
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,990
And then you know,

66
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,410
from the audience out for a
minute and then wander off.

67
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:44,850
And when I can take my drink and my chair
and sit down and like in my spot and

68
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,340
take up space for western,

69
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:46,570
you know,

70
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,040
um,

71
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,860
I saw Hicks at the
comedy connection and uh,

72
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,580
I saw him because he was on the
Rodney Dangerfield special and,

73
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:53,780
uh,

74
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,061
you know,

75
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,940
I was a aspiring comedians.

76
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,650
So I went to see everybody was on the
Rodney Dangerfield special when they came

77
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,290
through town and Boston
was one of those pit stops.

78
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,101
It was like Chicago,

79
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:02,641
Boston,

80
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:02,821
you know,

81
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,160
there was places where people
would come through and you know,

82
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:08,310
you would guarantee that they
would be in your town eventually.

83
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,031
And,

84
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:09,864
uh,

85
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,370
Hicks went up.

86
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,260
He went up at the comedy connection,

87
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,530
or the first time I actually saw
him was at Nick's comedy stop.

88
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,530
And he went up after this
guy was a incredible hack.

89
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,364
The guy was like,

90
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,020
cop donut jokes,

91
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,771
cartoons,

92
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,521
smoking pot,

93
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:26,730
and make them all the most
hackneyed obvious premises.

94
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,340
And he was Callin audiences filled idiots.

95
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,510
Nobody knew who Hicks was.

96
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,010
Me and maybe 50 other comedians in the
back of the room at a 300 people who were

97
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:39,270
in the audience places packed
by 20 minutes in this show,

98
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,800
half the people have left,

99
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,400
you know,

100
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,520
I mean literally cleared out
at least 50% by the end event.

101
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,020
It was maybe a hundred people left and
it was a 50 audience members and 50

102
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,190
comedians and we,

103
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,110
and he didn't give a fuck.

104
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,220
He never came.

105
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,660
I,

106
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,370
if one joke would go wrong for me,

107
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,410
I would go into a tailspin.

108
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,393
I would,

109
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,830
I would go the,

110
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,680
I would rush my jokes.

111
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,180
I would say fuck too much.

112
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:04,631
I would just,

113
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:04,960
I would,

114
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,370
I would not have any confidence.

115
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,700
He's in the middle of this bit about
how Satan fugs John Davidson who don't

116
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,510
remember John Davidson was the host of,

117
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,440
that's incredible.

118
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,600
It was,

119
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,380
was the,

120
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,213
you know,

121
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,870
one of them was like the Internet
before there was the internet.

122
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,990
So it's the demon with his thorny cock
is fucking John Davidson in the ass.

123
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,690
And John Ever Davidson swells up and
the off season cause he's pregnant with

124
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:31,951
Lucifer,

125
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:32,784
his baby.

126
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,920
And he shits out Oprah Winfrey or,

127
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,880
or Geraldo Rivera,

128
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,470
depending on where Hicks was at.

129
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,250
And so Hicks's standing onstage shitting.

130
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,830
So he's pausing going,

131
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,631
I mean,

132
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:49,150
this fucking minutes,

133
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,560
man,

134
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,250
minutes of just,

135
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,200
just straining and people just getting
up and leaving and he looks up in the

136
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,034
middle of it goes.

137
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,900
Yup.

138
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,410
It's usually clear as a room

139
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,030
and we're just crying,

140
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,811
laughing.

141
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:09,811
And I got to see him bomb horribly
but yet still kill for 50 to a hundred

142
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:11,591
people.

143
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,030
And then I got,

144
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,731
I got to see him,

145
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,150
you know,

146
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,530
kill or the whole,

147
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,423
the whole crowd.

148
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,440
But what an interesting guy.

149
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:22,000
It's like he was doing something
that nobody else was doing.

150
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,340
I mean,

151
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,990
he was like,

152
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,990
he was injecting Noam Chomsky and know
and philosophy and Terence Mckenna.

153
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,080
And it was like,

154
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,500
like,

155
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,100
Whoa,

156
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,591
like what was,

157
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:30,850
you know,

158
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,930
I didn't even like when I first saw
Kennison Kinison was the first time I ever

159
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,010
thought I could do comedy.

160
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,610
I was like,

161
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:36,851
you know,

162
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,190
I thought saw these guys
rolling up their sleeves,

163
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,024
talking about,

164
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,870
did you ever notice?

165
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,703
And it was like,

166
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,370
wow,

167
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,050
I kind of get kind of could do that.

168
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,090
I guess I kind of could do
that if I had to do that.

169
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,550
But then I start Kennison and,

170
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:49,180
and you know,

171
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,700
fucking scream and I was married,

172
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,823
fuck.

173
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,330
And he was angry and it was
funny and I was laughing.

174
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,030
I was like,

175
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,863
well,

176
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,180
maybe there's a comedy for me,

177
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,470
maybe I can find my comedy.

178
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:00,040
Right.

179
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,730
And then when I saw Hicks,

180
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,320
I was like,

181
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,951
oh,

182
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:06,430
this guy just flipped the whole
fucking thing on its head.

183
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,470
Now it's now it's,

184
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:08,891
you know,

185
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:13,891
it's about formulating a philosophy on
life and that there is a possibility

186
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:19,090
outside of the direction that we're
going in and then it is possible for the

187
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:20,250
human beings and the,

188
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:20,401
the,

189
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:20,740
you know,

190
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,920
the human civilization to rise up and,

191
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,120
and be about love and be
about understanding and be
about intellectual curiosity

192
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,321
and,

193
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,700
and it to be free of judgment.

194
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,330
I was like,

195
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,800
this guy's a fucking comedian.

196
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,900
Like this is the craziest
Shit I've ever seen.

197
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,970
It's almost like his jokes
were an afterthought to
inject his philosophy and to

198
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:40,481
the audience.

199
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:40,690
Yes.

200
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,410
I think part of it.

201
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,130
Yeah,

202
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,963
absolutely.

203
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,620
So what,

204
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:43,880
Oh,

205
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,441
what I've loved,

206
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:44,630
I,

207
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:44,861
you know,

208
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:45,481
I kind like,

209
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,314
uh,

210
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,940
my,

211
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,390
you know,

212
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,980
spend a little,

213
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,010
I spent all the time in that
little comedy world for awhile.

214
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,070
It was very always very inspiring
to me to watch comedians like him.

215
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,490
Uh,

216
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,770
basically just stick to their guns and
finish their act without getting that

217
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,551
nervous sweat.

218
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,560
I mean it was always
inspiring too to see that.

219
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:05,561
And it's always my favorite comedy clubs
to go to where the ones that you end

220
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:06,890
up,

221
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,040
if you're sitting out front of,

222
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:08,360
uh,

223
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,320
the Mann's Chinese,

224
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,340
they give you tickets to go to
this free comedy club go then.

225
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Because if it's a good comedian on you
can like take bets to see how quickly the

226
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,460
room's going to clear,

227
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,380
you know?

228
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,120
And we had,

229
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,640
I think I remember one time he hit
Andy kindler did a whole thing where he

230
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:29,870
brought everybody he knew down there
kind of have like a little a side,

231
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,461
you know sides,

232
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:34,790
seats with all the comedians that he had
a big sleeve and they did a whole like

233
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,030
debunking comedy and like a like a hack
hack a class and they had everybody come

234
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:44,410
up and just do like the hack thing
in front of this audience and this,

235
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,390
I said all these people that just kind
of one tickets from you know and got

236
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:48,680
tickets to new Manson
Sandy's and they're just,

237
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,390
I don't understand like that's funny.

238
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,130
Why?

239
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,970
Why is that hack?

240
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:53,804
Let's funny like,

241
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,200
and then you know that whole
thing went on for like an hour,

242
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,201
hour and a half.

243
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,880
I was just in the back of the room,

244
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,780
just peeing myself,

245
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:02,360
watching them go through this and
then some dude gets up after the meds,

246
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:06,590
their act and does everything that they
just went through and the audience is

247
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,100
like,

248
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,650
oh that's so funny.

249
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:09,580
Can I have another break?

250
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,900
And then David Cross gets up and then
just clears the room was awesome.

251
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,351
Opening line.

252
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:17,531
Just,

253
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:18,070
you know,

254
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,860
I saw Schindler's list the other day
and Schindler's list finally saw it.

255
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:21,910
Uh,

256
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,743
it's not that funny.

257
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,260
This whole table of people just
get up and out the door like,

258
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:26,651
and it just,

259
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:27,650
every joke that he said,

260
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:28,361
it was like we're watching.

261
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,580
Like he just set off a bomb there.

262
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,180
He just set off a bomb there,

263
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,393
cleared the room.

264
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,090
David Cross is a rarely credited,

265
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:38,310
but in my opinion of
watching it all happen,

266
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:42,660
he's the originator of the idea of
alternative comedy because I saw him do an

267
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:47,130
alternative comedy in 1988 he
was in Boston and Cambridge.

268
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,140
He would go up and he would do,

269
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,090
I remember one time it was doing this,

270
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,953
this uh,

271
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,300
exercise video where it would teach you,

272
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,740
teach you how to stretch.

273
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,760
So you've played the exercise video two
stretches that I really do feel as trach

274
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,890
and he was like doing this like long and
people like nervously giggling and not

275
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:05,670
showing where,

276
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,870
not sure where it was going and it
never went anywhere and everywhere.

277
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,310
But it was amusing and I felt,

278
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:16,080
I felt he was like a better version
of what I'm Andy Kaufman was doing.

279
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,740
Andy Kaufman would get up in front of
like colleges and like read the great

280
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,420
Gatsby and I was like,

281
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:22,560
well that's kind of fucked.

282
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,690
It's not really funny at all.

283
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,610
This is kind of crazy like it is now.

284
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:26,941
Yeah,

285
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:27,661
it is now.

286
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:27,960
Yeah.

287
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,250
It's like a delayed reaction to like
witness it as great longterm absorption.

288
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:32,940
Yeah,

289
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,250
but cross was d he was
funny why it was doing,

290
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:35,670
it was,

291
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,331
it was weird.

292
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:37,470
It was just so silly.

293
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,360
It was actually funny why he was doing it.

294
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,130
Do you like comedy?

295
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,060
I like music because I'm
completely unmusical.

296
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,400
I don't have any skill.

297
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,660
I don't have any talent.

298
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,494
I don't have,

299
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,940
I don't understand it.

300
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:51,210
I don't.

301
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,190
I see those bars that might as
well be Tibetan know Sanskrit.

302
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,150
I don't know what it is.

303
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,390
So when I see someone perform music,

304
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:00,720
when I,

305
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,010
when I'm in awe,

306
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,430
it's like,

307
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,110
to me it's a beautiful,

308
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,040
wonderful experience.

309
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,250
Do you feel the same way about
comedy because you don't do comedy?

310
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:12,510
Do you watch comedy and just get a like
a free sense of enjoyment that you might

311
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,760
not get from watching
something that you actually,

312
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,210
I generally enjoy more a scripted like
a film calming and when I see a group of

313
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,500
guys who have figured out,

314
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,311
not a formula,

315
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,300
but there's just a,

316
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,230
there's a rhythm to their comedy and
they've actually created a character

317
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:27,651
behind,

318
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:27,860
you know,

319
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,160
that actor brings something to the
table that you want to look at.

320
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,090
And then their timing in this scenario
where it's clearly they are just play

321
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:35,480
acting.

322
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:35,751
It's like,

323
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:35,901
hey,

324
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:36,920
we're just playing dress up,

325
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:40,460
pretend and you still laugh
because the writing solid,

326
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:42,670
but the what they bring to the
table with the writing of solid.

327
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,440
So like,

328
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,700
you know when you're seeing things
like the movie super troopers,

329
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,150
it's just like those guys had to have
a lot of fun making that film because

330
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:50,931
everything was just like,

331
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,130
the writing was perfect.

332
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
It's a quotable film.

333
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,800
It's like every step of the way.

334
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,090
It's the,

335
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,490
every,

336
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,640
every scene is quotable and
they're just having fun.

337
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,474
And then you see,

338
00:09:59,780 --> 00:09:59,961
you know,

339
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,300
almost almost any will
Ferrell filling the tank.

340
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,320
Those guys just,

341
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,153
yeah.

342
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,630
Uh,

343
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,540
John C.

344
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,220
Reilly is like just a master.

345
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,300
It just bringing his thing to the table
and then making your script come alive.

346
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,170
Uh,

347
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,950
it's just a great,

348
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,790
that to me is like,

349
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,091
and I,

350
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,230
and I look at that and I go,

351
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,970
what the fuck did you do that?

352
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,940
I have no idea how they did that
and I have no idea how to be funny.

353
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,060
And just so I'm watching them just
like nail these things out of the park.

354
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:26,210
Like you could put all that script on
the paper and show it to me and I would

355
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:27,044
just go,

356
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,913
which I have.

357
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,611
Where do I start?

358
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:28,880
Like,

359
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,570
you know,

360
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,440
how is this funny?

361
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,100
One of my favorite all time
Comedians is Mitch Hedberg.

362
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,640
And One of the reasons why Mitch is one
of my favorites is cause none of his

363
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:37,930
stuff was funny on paper.

364
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,430
It didn't make any sense.

365
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,360
Like you would see.

366
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,553
He goes,

367
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,100
you know,

368
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,821
somebody asked me,

369
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,470
do I want a frozen banana?

370
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,041
I said,

371
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:45,820
no,

372
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,770
but I want a regular banana later.

373
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,120
So yes.

374
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,680
Now if you saw that on paper and be like,

375
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
why is that funny?

376
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,901
What the fuck is,

377
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,160
I might have butchered his joke.

378
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,210
I don't think that's good thing.

379
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,133
It was pretty close.

380
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,060
But I love that.

381
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,570
I love that he redefined
comedy in a certain way too,

382
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:05,760
because he made some,

383
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,693
first of all,

384
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,200
I was a heroin addict and
he had only clean comedy.

385
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,420
I mean his stuff was squeaky clean.

386
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,763
You're going to be what?

387
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,360
He was gang green and his leg because
he was fucking shooting in the same vein

388
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:20,194
too many times.

389
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,470
It was a really a strange guy.

390
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,760
And his material was all so odd.

391
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,370
And if you loved Mitch Hedberg,

392
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,270
it was awesome.

393
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,620
But like Mitch Hedberg would go on after
these guys that would like sing and

394
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:38,000
dance and do song parodies and you know,

395
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,450
they would close with
a rap and he would eat.
