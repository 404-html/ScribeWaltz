1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,910
Sam harris,
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,810
All right,
there we go.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,820
We're live to the world.
You're going to do a read fucked up.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,210
I don't do that anymore.
Oh,

5
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,640
cool.
I do it before or after.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Um,
that way the conversation isn't garbled 

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,460
by five minutes of ads.
Just got annoying.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,780
No,
that's a good call.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,110
Yeah.
Well there's two different versions of 

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,110
this.
The one that goes up on youtube.

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,051
So the one that goes on Youtube has no 
ads in it unless youtube puts up pants 

12
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,000
and the one that goes on podcasts or 
itunes rather has a,

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,700
the ads.
So there you go.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,390
So we could just talk.
Yeah,

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,770
we're good to see you.
Good to see you too,

16
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,970
man.
Absolutely.

17
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,200
It's a,
it's an interesting time.

18
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:52,201
I know you're at an MMA fan.
Do you know about the John John's 

19
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:52,201
situation?
I've heard rumors about it,

20
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,220
but I don't actually know how far the 
misbehavior run.

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,850
So he got stripped of his title today or
yesterday actually.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,880
They announced a new title fight between
Daniel Cormier and Anthony Rumble 

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,580
Johnson.
They will be fighting for the now 

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,991
vacated title.
Jon Jones is likely going to jail what 

25
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:13,950
a.
It was a hit and run crash into a 

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,370
pregnant woman who allegedly,
I should say it broke her arm.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,640
She was rushed to the hospital,
but pregnant got to be terrifying for 

28
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:25,801
her.
We had a car crash and smashed by a guy 

29
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,230
runs a red light and then flees the 
scene of the crime,

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,380
so he drove away.
He ran away and ran away.

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,550
Cars wrecked cars wrecked.
You see the images of her car.

32
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,000
I couldn't imagine unless he was driving
fucking Humvee on how he could get away.

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,330
It was pretty bad.
Was it a dui or or that we don't know 

34
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,380
because he disappeared for like 24 hours
at least.

35
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,070
Probably even more a couple of days.
I think he disappeared for which,

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,100
you know,
obviously the speculation would be that 

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,560
he was on something that he would worry 
about getting tested for for 24 hours or

38
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:58,561
48 hours or whatever it was.
That I think of how desperate to move 

39
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:01,090
and,
and hapless and move that is to run away

40
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,740
from the car that you're leaving in the 
seed,

41
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:07,741
which is obviously traceable to you.
It's not like we're getting out of the 

42
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:09,790
problem and you're leaving an injured 
person there to.

43
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,950
Yeah,
I mean it's a disaster,

44
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:15,340
but it's worse because he actually ran 
back to the car stuff out of the car and

45
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:18,640
then ran away again.
No Man id by a cop.

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,360
Right.
A disaster all across the board.

47
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,330
But not what we're here for.
But I know you're an MMA fan,

48
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:25,870
so.
No,

49
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:26,280
we have it.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,960
But bringing up.
Yeah.

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,610
I actually have a question for you 
though in the close topic.

52
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:34,611
Um,
and we have a list of questions that we 

53
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:37,010
got from twitter but mcgregor or Aldo,
I'm.

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Who knows,
that's my answer is going to be 

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,080
interesting.
It's going to be very interesting fight.

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,670
We've never seen mcgregor in with 
anybody remotely as talented as Josie.

57
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,950
Aldo.
Not even remotely.

58
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,340
It doesn't mean you can't win because 
everybody that Mcgregor has been in 

59
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,340
with,
he steamrolled.

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,670
He steam rolled really talented guys 
like Dustin ea and just he's.

61
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,860
He's fucking good.
Yeah,

62
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,950
he's good.
He's really good,

63
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,970
really confident,
and he.

64
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,060
He really fucks with people's heads.
He's so confident and so good at 

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,471
talking,
and so there's so much charisma about 

66
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,080
him that I think it's intimidating to 
his opponents.

67
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:16,081
I think when they get in there with him,
his just overwhelming belief and belief 

68
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,810
is an incredibly powerful thing.

69
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,170
If you really,
truly believe that you are the best and 

70
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,821
you say it,
your opponents have to wonder because 

71
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:30,760
everybody's,
everybody questions themselves,

72
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,820
especially in the world of,
of fighting because you know,

73
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:37,210
one is if you were born a rhino,
okay,

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,170
and,
uh,

75
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:41,080
you were about to get into a fight with 
a parakeet,

76
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,260
you'd absolutely be confident because 
you've always been a rhino and that 

77
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,080
parakeets just a parakeet that parakeets
fucked.

78
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,620
But a person is a,
is a work in progress and not just from 

79
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:58,441
your fighting style,
but your ability to manage your own 

80
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:01,891
mind,
your ability to manage insecurities and 

81
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:04,531
anxieties.
Just the existential angst that comes 

82
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,201
with being a human being that's 
navigating their way through this 

83
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:07,570
complicated world.
There's variables,

84
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,600
there's,
there's days you're up and days you're 

85
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,791
down and then you add into that martial 
arts and you don't get good at martial 

86
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,350
arts unless you get your ass kicked.

87
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,370
There's only one way through.
I mean you can be one of those John 

88
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,990
Jones types.
It's unbelievably physically talented 

89
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,560
and have a leg up on a lot of people,
but even John had to get his ass kicked.

90
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,180
You had to.
He had to.

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,350
He had to compete and wrestling against 
guys who were better than him.

92
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,390
He had to learn martial arts.
You had a spa.

93
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,130
I mean there's gonna be days.
You're up in days,

94
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:37,060
you're down.
There's no way.

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,240
So when you get in there with a guy like
conor mcgregor to take pot hole that 

96
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,520
craziest because he's just like,
fuck,

97
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:50,521
this guy's overwhelming.
It's like if you can put on a show like 

98
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:54,001
that,
if you can put your peacock feathers up 

99
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,521
and and a puff up your back,
heres get those bristles up nice and 

100
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,730
high like a cat when it's angry and 
hunch your back up.

101
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,980
Like there's a reason why that exists in
nature.

102
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,330
Well,
it's beyond what Mohammed Ali used to 

103
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:05,330
do.
She's taken it to so it's going gonna be

104
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,690
fascinating psychologically to see him 
when he loses.

105
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,130
If when,
when that day comes,

106
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:12,760
it will come eventually and he has lost.
He's lost to a guy named Joe Duffy who's

107
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,030
now in the UFC and he's very good.
This guy,

108
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,360
Joe Duffy is fucking very good,
but he had.

109
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,780
He lost since his rise to.
No,

110
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,970
he has not lost until you've been in the
UFC and he.

111
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:29,200
But in all fairness,
the one style that he has not faced,

112
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,410
which is the most difficult style,
has never faced a wrestler.

113
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,690
It was never faced a guy who can get in 
there and get him to the ground and 

114
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,890
outwork him and just sap his energy 
wrestlers.

115
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,100
They get on top of you and you can't get
them off and you get exhausted trying 

116
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,390
and they they're punching you in the 
face and elbow you in the face and 

117
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,181
punching you in the body and constantly 
trying to strangle you and then the 

118
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:56,410
round is up and you'd get up and the 
next round comes and they do it again.

119
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,210
Boom.
You're on your back and boom,

120
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:00,860
you're getting punched in the face.
He's never faced a guy like that before.

121
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,100
All the fighters he's faced to have 
chosen to stand up with him and he's a 

122
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,300
very high level boxer.
He was amateur champion as a boxer.

123
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,860
He's got very good to Jitsu skills.
Very good morning ty.

124
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,370
Good.
Very good.

125
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:18,371
Everything.
We just never seen him against a top 

126
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:18,371
flight wrestler,
but Aldo is not that.

127
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,430
All those.
Not that,

128
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,330
but although is a world class Brazilian 
Jujitsu fighter,

129
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,970
like people who are not aware of his 
ground skills.

130
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,470
I'll go beat a guy named Cole Breena and
an actual Jujitsu competition.

131
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,550
Just very high level Breanna's world 
championship caliber.

132
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,060
So Aldo is going to present him with 
some things inside the octagon that he's

133
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,200
never faced before.
However,

134
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,340
although has been fighting 
professionally for a very long time,

135
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,580
and I'm like a race car that doesn't 
ever get its tires changed or doesn't 

136
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:52,580
ever get it.

137
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,060
Suspension redone.
Your as a human being,

138
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,540
your body can literally only take so 
many miles.

139
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,020
There's only so many times you can go to
war.

140
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,060
There's so many,
so many sparring sessions you can take 

141
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,780
part in only so many wrestling sessions 
you can take part in.

142
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,990
There's just a certain amount your body 
can take and we don't know when that 

143
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,680
number is,
when when you reach that number though,

144
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,920
that's it,
and now there's no turning back unless 

145
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,080
you're using testosterone or growth 
hormone or some.

146
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,110
Some things that turn your body into the
superhuman sort of experiment to.

147
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,490
Unless he's doing that,
which we've seen from Vito Belfort,

148
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Vito Belfort's,
the only guy who actually got better as 

149
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:33,680
he got older talking to my guy from UFC 
12,

150
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,720
miracle of science.
It's exactly what it is.

151
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Absolutely fascinating,
and you can't completely discount his 

152
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,440
training because this training is what 
made him better,

153
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,740
but his ability to recover was 
essentially supernatural.

154
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,390
You know,
he's fighting.

155
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,730
I'm in the same car that Jones is 
supposed to fight.

156
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:54,731
He's fighting Chris Weidman,
but now Nevada has made testosterone 

157
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,470
replacement therapy illegal.
So his last three performances,

158
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,630
which are some of the best performances 
of his career,

159
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,020
the knockout of Michael bisping knockout
of Luke rockhold and the knockout of Dan

160
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,090
Henderson.
Those were all while he was on 

161
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,090
testosterone.
So yeah.

162
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,090
Okay.
Yeah,

163
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,980
so things get weird now.
Now you see what a 37 year old man 

164
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,750
really looks like,
you know,

165
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,200
optimizing hormones as best he can 
naturally.

166
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,420
Hopefully.
Yeah.

167
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,370
Well 37 sounds young.
It sounds like that level of 

168
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:25,970
testosterone.
Well,

169
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,930
you know,
it's also the,

170
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,990
the level of testosterone have a regular
37 year old man versus the level of 

171
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,671
testosterone for someone going through a
camp when you're going through those 

172
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,400
camps is absolutely brutal.
Like Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier,

173
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,940
they both got tested randomly before.
They're,

174
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,970
their um,
title fight and their testosterone 

175
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,640
levels were so low.
People will weren't wondering like,

176
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,860
Hey,
maybe these guys are doing something.

177
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,920
Maybe they were doing steroids and that 
made their testosterone levels drop,

178
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,190
but what's most likely it's testosterone
to epitestosterone that was very low

179
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,350
testosterone levels.
Most likely.

180
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:02,400
It's just the brutality of training.
It's so hard.

181
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,380
It's so hard to do.
You,

182
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,460
you,
you showing up everyday exhausted and 

183
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,860
your muscles are sore and your body's 
exhausted.

184
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:14,861
You've got to go through it all again 
tomorrow and you're getting kicked and 

185
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:17,421
punched and you lifting weights and 
you're doing sprint and you jumping up 

186
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:20,151
on boxes and and then the next day all 
over again and your body just can't keep

187
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:25,341
up,
especially when you get into your 

188
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:25,341
thirties.
Yeah.

189
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:26,250
All right,
well the answer that and I will watch it

190
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,720
with interest.
It's going to be very exciting.

191
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,500
Let me know if you want to go.
It's in.

192
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,860
I,
we'll talk about that.

193
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,520
We'll talk about Sam Harris goes to the 
fights as a neuroscientist to disturb 

194
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,430
you at all.
When you're seeing these guys getting,

195
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,610
getting their heads rattled to you when 
you're.

196
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:46,890
You're very aware of what's going on 
behind the scenes.

197
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,680
In the actual brain itself.
Yeah.

198
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,120
Well,
I just,

199
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,570
I just talked about this in my blog with
this writer Jonathan Gottschall,

200
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,530
who I told you about it at one point.
I'm trying to get him on the podcast.

201
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,770
Yeah,
he's great.

202
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,830
And um,
so we had a conversation which we 

203
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:03,830
publish the transcript of,
but he,

204
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,040
he's got this book that the professor in
the cage where he's an academic,

205
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:13,041
he's an English professor and he decided
to get really damn may and fight a real 

206
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,110
cage match.
Um,

207
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,130
and so it's,
uh,

208
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:20,910
it's interesting book and so he and I 
were talking about the discomfort.

209
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:25,911
We have stress seeing people get brain 
damage in real time for our amusement.

210
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,380
And yeah,
it does make me uncomfortable,

211
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,410
but I'm also part of what's thrilling.
I mean,

212
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:31,690
I,
you know,

213
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:34,040
I'm as thrilled by the prospect of a 
knockout too.

214
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,460
It's kind of,
it's not even a conscious thrill is just

215
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,470
when,
when things start going that way you 

216
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:41,470
feel your own,
you know,

217
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,050
testosterone or something kick in.

218
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,680
And um,
but I am a,

219
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:50,681
his recommendation was that,
and I'm sure he's not the only person 

220
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:51,940
who's thought of this,
he thought the gloves she'd come off and

221
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:56,941
the gloves are making it,
that you making it realistic to just 

222
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:59,340
send enlist overhand rights and other 
crazy punches,

223
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,440
you know,
full force into people's heads for,

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,120
for,
you know,

225
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,740
30 minutes.
Whereas if you,

226
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,930
if you were to,
if it was a bare knuckle fight,

227
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,230
you,
you couldn't really be fewer knockouts 

228
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,871
but you couldn't deliver that kind of 
brain trauma because you'd be breaking 

229
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:19,161
your hands.
Now obviously there are things like 

230
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:19,650
elbows and knees and kicks and so people
would still be getting hurt.

231
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:22,080
But what do you think about that?
Would that change?

232
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,480
If I'm a big advocate of that,
and I've said it many times,

233
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,030
I've said it on the air,
I've talked about it on this podcast.

234
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,360
I think it's a very unrealistic,
the way you're allowed to not just put 

235
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,180
gloves on,
but also wrap your hands up.

236
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,490
Taping lists.
Your risk is a joint.

237
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:40,470
It flexes and when you tape it up and 
they get that sucker up nice and tight,

238
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:42,570
then it becomes something completely 
unrealistic.

239
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,080
If you punch someone with your hand 
without a glove on and with no hand 

240
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:53,841
wraps,
it's way easier to hyper extend your 

241
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:53,841
wrist or twists or tweak or break it.

242
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,010
Your hand brakes.
You hit someone in the forehead for 

243
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,010
heads are far harder than your knuckles 
are.

244
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,810
Most likely you're going to break it 
unless you hit them on the nose and the 

245
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:03,810
eye on the jaw.
You're,

246
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,230
you're going to hurt your hand and you 
can only throw so many punches like that

247
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:08,980
and even just hitting a heavy bag 
without being wrapped up.

248
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,720
You just screw up your wrist and your 
hands.

249
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,750
Yeah,
you have to really learn how to tighten 

250
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,761
everything up and you have to really 
strengthen your wrist and you have to 

251
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:17,761
strengthen your,
your,

252
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,030
your hand muscles.
It's a completely different thing,

253
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,690
which is why the,
uh,

254
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,970
Kinda the karate students would hit a 
mucky water,

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,310
which is a board that's wrapped with a 
rope.

256
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,640
And the idea behind punching that board 
wrapped in rope over and over again as 

257
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,930
you develop these intense calluses all 
over the front two knuckles,

258
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,000
which is really the only way you're 
supposed to hit someone.

259
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,520
Those are the knuckles that are 
reinforced by the wrist.

260
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,730
Whereas the where the pinky finger is 
and the ring finger,

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,940
those knuckles are not reinforced nearly
as well,

262
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,660
especially if you have a larger hands 
like your hand.

263
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:53,661
Like my hand spreads out past my wrist.
It doesn't go in a straight line from my

264
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:59,461
wrist to the pinky.
It actually goes out to the side so 

265
00:12:59,461 --> 00:12:59,461
that,
that,

266
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,930
that knuckles not enforced by anything.
If you punch someone with a boxing glove

267
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,190
on with that knuckle,
you're fine,

268
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,260
right?
If you punched someone with an MMA glove

269
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,300
on,
it's less supported.

270
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,230
If you punch them on bare knuckle,
you are very likely to break your hand.

271
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,260
If you punched someone full force on the
forehead and you hit the with the pinky 

272
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,500
knuckle,
you're very likely to break your hand.

273
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,840
It's a high possibility.
Also,

274
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,841
it it.
It also impedes your grappling to have 

275
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:24,841
those gloves on.

276
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:25,400
Right?
Garcia went to,

277
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,010
yeah,
I'm so huge issue.

278
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,940
Marcello Garcia fought in Japan,
I believe it was,

279
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,950
had this guy's back and couldn't finish 
them.

280
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,740
I was just grabbing and grabbing gloves,
gloves,

281
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:40,741
holding onto the gloves.
The guy just worked on his defense and 

282
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,760
the gloves with a like Marcello's 
specialties,

283
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:45,040
the rear naked choke and the rear naked 
choke.

284
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,400
A big part of it is sliding your hands 
underneath the guy's Chin like and we 

285
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:55,621
have the glove there.
There's all this extra padding that 

286
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:57,640
makes it very difficult to get your hand
in the proper position to formula to get

287
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:58,370
the choke right,
right,

288
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,750
right in the back of the head.
It's also very difficult to get the 

289
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,780
glove and the back of the head,
so a lot of times you'll see in an mma 

290
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,931
fight,
guys are used poor technique and still 

291
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:09,931
finish the choke will.

292
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,040
They'll use their palm on the top or the
back of their head because they can't do

293
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:17,041
this.
Can't do this movement where it's 

294
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,561
actually the back of your hand should 
touch the back of your opponent's head 

295
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,700
because all like to someone who doesn't 
understand Jujitsu,

296
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,040
that's very complicated,
but I agree with them.

297
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,990
I think that a gloves would help a lot.
Yeah.

298
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,480
Or gloves or no gloves,
right?

299
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,620
Yeah.
I think would help a lot,

300
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,830
but I think it's also.
It would be.

301
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,910
It would be beneficial for everyone to 
have some intensely comprehensive scans 

302
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:46,381
done on a regular basis.
I don't know if that would be 

303
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:46,780
prohibitive financially.
I don't know how much that would cost.

304
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,170
I don't know how much that would even 
reveal because apparently one of the 

305
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,370
things that is troublesome for

306
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,370
these nfl players is a when they die and
they do autopsies on them and they 

307
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,970
revealed damage that they had no idea 
before mean I don't know how much like 

308
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,441
an Fmr and Mri can detect when it comes 
to the actual damage.

309
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:11,651
Well it can,
but to what end because you know you're 

310
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:14,081
getting it.
If you're just going to be in a job 

311
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:14,180
where you have to get hit in the head,
forget about competition.

312
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:19,181
Just training,
I mean these guys train hard so they're 

313
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:20,090
getting hit in the head to prepare them 
to get hit in the head,

314
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,950
in the match.

315
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,450
You're just,
you.

316
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,200
It's not even,
it's like smoking.

317
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,800
It's like the causal linkage between 
getting hit in the head and brain trauma

318
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,860
is 100 percent.
It's just a matter of it's just a matter

319
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:41,861
of how much you can you individually by 
dent of luck can take until you actually

320
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:45,410
have damage that matters.
Uh,

321
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,370
so,
you know,

322
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,600
I obviously haven't had an experience 
anything like an MMA fighter,

323
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,990
but I regret all the head injuries I 
took just training as a.

324
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,380
Now in martial arts,
I just don't let myself get hit in the 

325
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,380
head,
but in,

326
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,550
as a teenager I got hit in the head a 
fair amount and I played soccer and 

327
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,130
headed the soccer ball and that always 
felt totally weird.

328
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:07,770
You know,
that you had,

329
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,490
did you play soccer?
You know,

330
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:14,491
he had a soccer ball.
You immediately get a kind of a rusty 

331
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:14,491
taste in your mouth,
you know,

332
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:15,740
and it's just unlike anything else that 
happened that day.

333
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,150
Except the other time you got hit in the
head,

334
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,490
um,
and he's not crazy that no one would 

335
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,410
ever think that soccer or another give 
you traumatic brain injury.

336
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,340
It's because it doesn't knock you out.
We have this until recently.

337
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,390
I,
I'd say like in the last couple of 

338
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:33,530
decades we had this erroneous assumption
that you had to get a knockout.

339
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,690
You got to get knocked out that brain 
damage,

340
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,930
but she just looked thuds just a little,
like I was talking to a doctor who said 

341
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:43,190
that water skiing can give you brain 
damage.

342
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,940
Waterskiing just hitting,
just the bouncing,

343
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,780
just wave riding,
you know,

344
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,250
like that bouncing.
That stuff can give you brain damage,

345
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,310
right?
Like your brain gets rattled around 

346
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,321
inside of your head,
the connective tissue dislodges and it 

347
00:16:59,321 --> 00:16:59,321
doesn't heal back.
Yeah.

348
00:16:59,321 --> 00:16:59,321
Well,
I mean,

349
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:04,091
so I spoke about this with Jonathan to 
that there's obviously all of these 

350
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,950
sports and just,
you know,

351
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,420
forms of recreation that that entails 
some risk of injury and death.

352
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:11,980
Right?
And so,

353
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:16,981
and people should be able to do these 
things in informed of the risks.

354
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,810
And so he,
the cheerleader and the example he 

355
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:22,810
brought up,
his cheerleader,

356
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:22,880
cheerleader sometimes hit the ground and
just,

357
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,740
you know,
fantastically injured.

358
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,160
So all these things that don't 
necessarily seem like high testosterone,

359
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,970
high risk,
you know,

360
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,140
you're just foolishly reckless.
Sports can be very dangerous and skiing 

361
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,670
is very dangerous to and read a rock 
climb and they're things that are,

362
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,570
that are even just nonviolent,
that don't entail much risk of injury 

363
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,130
until they kill you.
Like Free Solo rock climbing,

364
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,070
you're climbing,
everything's.

365
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Maybe you hurt your hands in the past,
but then all of a sudden you're dead 

366
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,910
because you just went up 500 feet 
without a rope and fell.

367
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,360
So there's all these kinds of risks that
people can take.

368
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:05,361
But the problem that the problem that I 
think differentiates striking sports 

369
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,200
from even something like football is 
that the progress in the sport is 

370
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,330
synonymous with the damage.

371
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,830
So you know,
if you and I are are,

372
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,180
are in a boxing match or a kickboxing 
match hitting each other,

373
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,870
the every instance of successfully 
degrading each other's performance with 

374
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:31,941
respect to the head.
Hitting someone in the head is 

375
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,450
synonymous with delivering injury to the
brain.

376
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,630
It's not like,
it's not incidental like in football 

377
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,630
where,
and I was trying to tackle you.

378
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,860
I was not hoping to hurt your brain,
but you know,

379
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,790
you fell,
fell down hard and uh,

380
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:47,000
did um,
this is just a trade of,

381
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,400
of brain damage and um,
yeah,

382
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,330
so it's,
it's,

383
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,110
it's a interesting ethically,
you know,

384
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,990
I don't know.
Again,

385
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,570
I think people should be free to do it,
but I think people,

386
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:02,571
you know,
we should be informed about it and I 

387
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:04,541
would,
I would certainly vote to pull the 

388
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,921
gloves off and make it more.
It would just make it more realistic 

389
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:06,921
combatively to.

390
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:07,680
It's insofar as you want to see what 
works.

391
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Combatively I'm more interested to see 
what two people can do just with their 

392
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,570
bare hands.
Then when they've got these,

393
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,070
you know,
most certainly.

394
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,120
And you know,
one of the interesting things that has 

395
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,120
been brought up online,
um,

396
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,620
over the last couple days about this 
John Jones situation,

397
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:30,621
is this a rational erratic behavior?
Does this imply that or does it somehow 

398
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,520
or another is it,
is it correlated to brain damage?

399
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,990
I mean,
it certainly can be.

400
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,690
Can Be,
right.

401
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,930
I mean that's one of the issues with 
brain damage.

402
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,760
Impulsive behavior.
Yeah.

403
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Especially in the frontal lobes because 
your frontal lobes regulate your 

404
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,960
emotional and behavioral outbursts and 
when those connections,

405
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,990
when either the cell body is or the 
connections between the gray matter in 

406
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,951
the frontal lobes and your,
your limbic system and your basal 

407
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,690
Ganglia and in other areas in the brain 
when that gets damaged,

408
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:08,691
yeah,
you have these classic impulse control 

409
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:09,060
problems where you just,
you know,

410
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:14,061
you just reached out and grabbed the 
woman standing next to you at starbucks 

411
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,260
because you couldn't dampen the,
the impulse to do it.

412
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,350
You know,
that's hard for people to grasp because 

413
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,540
again,
this should be really clear.

414
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,830
I am without a doubt not trying to let 
him off the hook.

415
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,160
What he did was horrible.
If it was someone in my family that he 

416
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,240
hit with that car,
I would be unbelievably furious.

417
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm incredibly disappointed in him.
I think the UFC absolutely did the right

418
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:42,561
thing in stripping him of his title and 
I think law enforcement is going to do 

419
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:45,360
the right thing by putting them in jail.
I mean they're going to just.

420
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,130
You can't do that.
You can't hit someone with a car

421
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,710
and leave the scene of the crime that it
is a crime,

422
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,880
but there are things that people do 
because they have brain damage and 

423
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,780
that's where the real question comes up 
is obviously they are responsible 

424
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,820
ultimately for their own actions,
but what is it that's responsible for 

425
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,740
making them do that action?
And we could.

426
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,960
We had this long conversation wants to 
podcasts ago.

427
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,640
I think of bliss,
about free will and determinism.

428
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,900
These are variables that come into play 
when it comes to the ultimate actions 

429
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,131
that you choose to do.
The ultimate movements that you choose 

430
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:26,131
to take.
The,

431
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:26,131
the,
the,

432
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:30,961
the,
the thought processes are questionably 

433
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:35,281
dependent upon the brain itself.
If the brain is getting damaged and if 

434
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:40,051
we have proven that some of the,
some of the issues with people that have

435
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,700
brain damage,
his impulse control.

436
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,240
You got to wonder,
man,

437
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,230
when you see fighters do wild crazy 
shit.

438
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,130
How much of that is due to getting just 
bunked in the fucking head off?

439
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

440
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,510
Except for me that it breaks down a 
little differently because they,

441
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,120
my views on free will change the picture
of how I view moral culpability in those

442
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:06,230
situations so that even if even if we 
knew his brain wasn't damaged,

443
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,890
right?
So he,

444
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,070
let's say had never got hit in the head 
or we did a scan on him before the car 

445
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,401
accident and we saw,
and it's the perfect scan is a scan of 

446
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,620
that we'll have 50 years from now,
don't fuck ourselves up.

447
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,280
And um,
so we just know that he's got a totally 

448
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,230
healthy brain,
uh,

449
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,240
by whatever metric of health we have.
But uh,

450
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,020
he got into that situation,
behaved exactly as irresponsibly as he 

451
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,231
did the,
his behavior still is the result of 

452
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:42,590
causes that he as an agent isn't 
ultimately responsible for.

453
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,320
Now,
this has,

454
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,300
has certain this as sort of the 
punchline,

455
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,330
which has certain consequences,
but one of the consequences is not that 

456
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,050
we can't respond to his misbehavior,
that he can't,

457
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:55,820
that we can't put them in jail,
that we can't,

458
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,240
that we couldn't have intervened at any 
point along the way to have made him a 

459
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240
better person.

460
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240
And it said there,
there are,

461
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,490
there are,
there's a difference between voluntary 

462
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,251
and involuntary behavior,
even if it's all just causally 

463
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,730
propagated from the moment of the big 
bang.

464
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,680
But I do view it as,
um,

465
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,960
I think the brain damage case is a 
little bit of a red herring because it's

466
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,830
on some level,
it's all just Qa,

467
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,920
unconscious causes that the,
the person himself can't ultimately 

468
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,170
account for.
So,

469
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:29,390
you know,
there are situations in which he,

470
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,140
I'm sure in his life,
behaved like a Mench,

471
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:35,180
you know,
behave totally responsibly.

472
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,300
And there's situations where he behaved 
like this.

473
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,610
Um,
and he can't,

474
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,670
he can't account for the difference in 
those two cases.

475
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:44,960
He can't account for why,
but let's just,

476
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,080
it's a fact that if he had gotten one 
hour more sleep the night before and 

477
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:56,411
hadn't had a fight with his girlfriend 
and had his blood sugar level was a 

478
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:58,400
little bit higher and had,
had,

479
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:03,401
you know,
I hadn't had a friend who had told him 

480
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,591
to drink one more beer,
which he normally would have resisted 

481
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:06,260
but couldn't because of all the other 
factors I've just mentioned.

482
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,820
And that is the difference that made the
difference that caused him to be this 

483
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,030
total misfit on the road.
Um,

484
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,530
whereas if you had just tweaked those 
dials a little bit,

485
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,090
you know,
fight with a girlfriend,

486
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,660
one more bite of food in the morning,
he would have been.

487
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,760
He would have acted as you would have 
acted in that case.

488
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,620
Say So.
Ultimately,

489
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,070
let's say that's true then that then 
that there's something,

490
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,450
there's a kind of bad luck component to,
to all of this creeping in and there's a

491
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,030
concept of moral luck,
which is due to the philosopher Thomas 

492
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,030
Nagel,
who,

493
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,010
who's done a lot of interesting work,
half of which I really agree with.

494
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:50,750
And some of it I don't,
but the concept of moral luck is that it

495
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:55,751
does seem unfair that there are many 
situations in which people create 

496
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:02,471
immense harms doing stuff that you and I
have gotten away with.

497
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,920
You know,
I mean,

498
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:08,921
they're not,
they're not worse people than we are 

499
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:08,921
like,
you know,

500
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:08,921
they,
you know,

501
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:12,200
you,
you and I have both driven when we 

502
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,200
shouldn't have driven,
you know,

503
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,770
we had one beer too many or were there 
things that we did or you're looking at,

504
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,650
you look at a text,
you know,

505
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,190
you know,
you should never look at your phone when

506
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,030
you're driving,
but you decide,

507
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:25,031
okay,
I'm expecting a text and you look and 

508
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,540
there are people who are looking at that
text right now and just,

509
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,730
you know,
killing some child in the crosswalk.

510
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,850
Right?
And their lives are going to be ruined 

511
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,801
and you know,
they're gonna go to prison and they're 

512
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:35,801
exactly like you and me.
Right?

513
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:35,900
So there's,
there's a,

514
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,060
there's an aspect of luck here,
but that the luck actually propagates 

515
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,260
backward into the kind of brain you 
have,

516
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,390
the kind of upbringing you had,
the kind of parents you had,

517
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:47,840
the kind of,
you know,

518
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:52,010
the fact that you got hit in the head as
hard as you did or didn't and no one has

519
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:52,670
made themselves.

520
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,670
So I'm a little bit more,
I'm less judgmental about some of these 

521
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,200
things given my view of freewill,
but I'm not,

522
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,640
it's not that I'm not interested in 
making the interventions that would make

523
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:09,641
a difference in whatever we could have 
done to have gotten him to behave 

524
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:12,581
differently.
We should have done whatever we should 

525
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:14,841
need to do now to him to make society 
better and to make him better and to get

526
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:17,030
restitution for the woman,
what we should do.

527
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:22,031
All that.
And so this doesn't tell locking up 

528
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:22,960
certain dangerous people and it doesn't 
tell,

529
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,190
you know,
we have to keep,

530
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,090
keep ourselves safe from people who are 
going to reliably act badly.

531
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,250
And um,
and I don't know where he falls on that 

532
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,250
spectrum,
but it's just,

533
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,441
it's not the difference between the 
feeling you get when you hear,

534
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,980
oh,
it was brain damage.

535
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,980
I sort of have that feeling about 
everything.

536
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,120
You know,
what if you,

537
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:44,940
if,
if we,

538
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,970
if he gets a brain scan,
if he goes to trial now he gets a brain 

539
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,551
scan and we,
and we find that his brain is just 

540
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:54,651
massively damaged in all the right areas
that would have eroded his impulse 

541
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:55,230
control.
Right.

542
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:57,030
That would seem to let them off the hook
a little bit.

543
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:57,930
It would,
he would,

544
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,960
he would look like someone who is 
unlucky more than he would look like a 

545
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,900
bad person.
Right.

546
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,580
And I sort of see bad people as unlucky 
to.

547
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I mean,
I got recognize that there are certain 

548
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,400
people who are quite classically bad 
people.

549
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,780
They're psychopaths who you just,
not only can you not rely on them,

550
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:19,050
you can rely on them to be bad actors,
you know,

551
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,190
so you have to,
you have to be in a posture of,

552
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,120
of self defense with respect to these 
people.

553
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:28,830
But I do view them as an unlucky on some
fundamental level.

554
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,860
That's I.
I shared that thought and I shared that 

555
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,011
thought much more as I get older and I 
have a more philosophical point of view 

556
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:42,160
when it comes to people that live in 
impoverished neighborhoods,

557
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,350
especially like this Baltimore thing 
that was going on.

558
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,800
We're just having this conversation the 
other day about or last podcast about 

559
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,790
these kids at robbed the Rte reporter,
and if you've seen the video of it,

560
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:58,150
there's an to reporter interviewing 
these kids that are on the street that 

561
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,831
are causing all this havoc and Baltimore
and they start swarming this reporter 

562
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:05,510
and then a robber and take her purse and
took off.

563
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,000
And I'm like,
imagine being one of those kids.

564
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:12,670
Imagine being in that environment.
Imagine being.

565
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,440
You want to talk about determinism 
managing,

566
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:17,590
being born into this crime Britain 
environment.

567
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,830
Who knows what kind of family you have,
who knows what kind of influences you 

568
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,491
have,
who knows what kind of experiences that 

569
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:29,281
you've had that you've had to react to 
and protect yourself from and developed 

570
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:33,321
this hardened,
thick skin and attitude and also 

571
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:34,150
survival instincts.

572
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,390
And you also,
your your family or the people that you 

573
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,690
can reliably count on are the people 
that you hang out in the street,

574
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:45,691
your gang.
And that is the big thing with gang 

575
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,391
violence.
One of the big things with gang 

576
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:48,391
violence,
one of the dirty secrets of it is it,

577
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:52,021
a lot of it comes from broken homes.
When people don't have a strong family 

578
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,260
environment and people they can count on
and trust.

579
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,500
They don't have anybody who is there for
them and then they find someone that's 

580
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,411
there for them in the gang and the gang 
becomes their new family and they will 

581
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:05,581
do anything to keep that love,
to reinforce that love and we all want 

582
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:08,170
to look at it as they're criminals.
They should be home by 10.

583
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,290
There's a curfew on the street.
It's completely unrealistic.

584
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,500
And if you were in their point of view 
or if you were in their life rather,

585
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,000
and if you saw it through their point of
view,

586
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,970
you would probably see exactly what they
say you would.

587
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,880
You would look at life,
the way they look at life.

588
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,500
Also,
there's another variable here,

589
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:24,210
which is just just

590
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,880
the influence of mob behavior,
people,

591
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:30,160
people will behave in crowds in ways 
that they wouldn't otherwise.

592
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,280
Is that.
What is that?

593
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,790
What's the mechanism behind that?
Yeah,

594
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,730
it's a facet.
Well,

595
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:39,731
I don't,
I can't speak to the mechanism 

596
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:39,731
neurologically,
but it's a,

597
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,530
it's a fascinating social that has been 
thought about for at least a century.

598
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:44,920
It's,
you know,

599
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:49,921
there was a philosopher,
I'm Elias Canetti who wrote a book 

600
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,820
crowds and power,
which is very interesting on this topic.

601
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:54,730
I'm a crowd.
A crowd is almost like a fire,

602
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:55,960
you know,
once it gets started,

603
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,410
the mob will behave by its dynamics that
aren't really explained by the 

604
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:05,950
individual intentions of the individuals
in the mob.

605
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,470
And because actually there's a great 
book.

606
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,790
Do you ever hear this book?
Uh,

607
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,330
among the thugs by Bill Buford?
He,

608
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,310
um,
having product 20,

609
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,850
25 years ago.
He's,

610
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,560
he's a,
uh,

611
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,850
not really nice writer.

612
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,400
He,
he edited a literary magazine,

613
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,950
Granta I believe back in the day.
And he,

614
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,140
he got fascinated with the phenomenon of
soccer hooliganism and he wanted,

615
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,540
he just,
he went to the UK and just start hanging

616
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,600
out with these,
these are just die hard,

617
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,310
you know,
I guess they were,

618
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,340
I don't know,
Manchester United or arsenal fans,

619
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:44,341
but just he just got in with these guys 
who are normal guys like plumbers and 

620
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:46,720
electricians and people have had real 
lives.

621
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,870
These were not just teenagers who were 
thugs.

622
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:54,871
They were,
they were people who had families but 

623
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:57,490
soccer was their life and they became,
they became a soccer hooligans.

624
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,300
And.
But what's,

625
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,390
what's brilliant about the book,
and again it's been at least 20 years 

626
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,811
since I read it,
so I could be a little off in my 

627
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:07,660
recollection here,
but what I recall is that he wrote it in

628
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:12,661
such a way that these guys,
he was hanging out with war.

629
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:17,680
Really the protagonist.
He got you in on their side for about 75

630
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:20,980
pages or so.
And then when they start misbehaving,

631
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,250
when they,
when they go to their first game against

632
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:29,251
the Italians and,
and form a mob and starting to just 

633
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:29,830
marauding the streets.
And you know,

634
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,300
Bash kids in the head,
I mean,

635
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:34,690
it's like they start behaving like 
sociopath in this crowd,

636
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,740
but he catches you out totally because 
you are,

637
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:43,741
these are,
you're on their team for about 75 pages 

638
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:43,741
and you're,
you're,

639
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:43,990
you're identified with them.
You sort of laughed with them.

640
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:48,991
You kind of,
you've bonded with them as he did and 

641
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,691
then he reveals the level of,
of thuggery that they are capable of as 

642
00:31:51,691 --> 00:31:51,691
a,
as a mob.

643
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,180
And it was really,
it was,

644
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,900
as I recall,
it being a fascinating book,

645
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,020
but it is,
it's just a fact that,

646
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,140
that people will do in a crowd,
even when you see it's a part of,

647
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:07,141
it's the social proof situation where 
you see everyone doing something and 

648
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:10,100
that on some level,
um,

649
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,940
gives you license to do it.

650
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,010
So the end,
there's kind of a,

651
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:20,070
it's just contagious.
We wouldn't see when you see people 

652
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,321
breaking windows or jumping on a car or 
turning over a car or alluding there,

653
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,190
it takes a less of any individual to 
participate in that.

654
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,220
You know,
it takes less for you to go in and grab 

655
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,201
a television set when you've seen 100 of
your neighbors do it then if you have 

656
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,530
and you wouldn't have that morning,
just woken up deciding to rob the store 

657
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:41,140
yourself.
Um,

658
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,930
so it's a,
um,

659
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,480
I mean we all like to think we're the 
sort of people who would stand against 

660
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,691
the mob.
We would be the German who would've hid 

661
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:53,240
Jews in our basement and stood against 
the Nazis and,

662
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,990
and,
and you can multiply those cases ad 

663
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,561
Nauseum,
but what a lot of psychological science 

664
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,590
shows that the.
Yeah,

665
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:08,591
there are those people,
there are the people who will stand 

666
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:09,890
against the tide of imbeciles who are 
going to do something heinous,

667
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:14,891
but most people are part of the tide and
it's just a very common phenomenon.

668
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,470
The social license.
That's a really interesting way to 

669
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,930
describe it because that is what,
what it is right here.

670
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,660
I mean,
isn't that a big part of war mean?

671
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:28,661
A big part of war is doing things that 
you would never do on a normal basis and

672
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,580
in a normal scenario,
on a regular basis,

673
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,880
you are asked to put bullets under other
human beings.

674
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,990
One of the things that I thought was 
really interesting about,

675
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:39,800
uh,
the,

676
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,990
the,
the controversy about American sniper,

677
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:45,890
the Chris Kyle movie was he was talking 
about what it was like the first time he

678
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:50,450
killed someone and that he is in a book,
I don't believe this was in the movie,

679
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:55,040
but that he had this feeling before he 
shot someone like,

680
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,020
is this okay?
I can actually do this,

681
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,320
is it's okay to do this.
And then he grew to enjoy it and then he

682
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,350
grew,
it became commonplace and normal and 

683
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,350
he's like,
yeah,

684
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,350
they're bad guys and I'm going to shoot 
him,

685
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:10,300
but this license,
the social license and then is a 

686
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:15,580
accentuated with this,
this mob mentality.

687
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,650
That's mean you're,
you're a part of an army and you have an

688
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:23,651
enemy and it's the life or death 
consequences of life or death scenario 

689
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:28,811
that you're a part of it.
The whole thing is escalated.

690
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,870
It's the highest level of that type of 
behavior that we have in,

691
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,500
in society,
in our culture today.

692
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,080
Well,
interesting.

693
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,810
Interestingly,
it takes a lot to get people to kill in 

694
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,041
war.
I think there's some myths around how 

695
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,010
easy it is for soldiers to shoot at the 
bad guy.

696
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:54,011
But there have been studies done in 
prior war is where some shocking 

697
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:59,111
percentage of soldiers either never 
fired their guns or fired above their 

698
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:03,320
targets on purpose.
They didn't want to kill anyone.

699
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,670
And that's been,
uh,

700
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:10,671
and,
and so some of the discipline of 

701
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:13,960
training soldiers has been against the 
grain of those tendencies trying to get 

702
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,390
people to actually try to kill the other
person.

703
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,340
Um,
and,

704
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,370
you know,
I think we've become more successful 

705
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:24,370
probably doing that.
Uh,

706
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,941
you know,
this is not something I know a ton 

707
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:27,941
about.
I just know that this,

708
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:31,180
this research is out there and what the 
main dynamic I think with,

709
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,010
with soldiers is you are trying to keep 
your buddy safe and he's trying.

710
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,530
He or she now is trying to keep you safe
and that,

711
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,230
that,
you know,

712
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,120
they're,
they're not only firing at you,

713
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,540
trying to kill you,
they're trying to kill your buddy or 

714
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540
just did and slash or just,
you know,

715
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,930
wounded him or her and now it's just a 
very simple dynamic that you're just,

716
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:56,931
you've bonded with the person to your 
right and to your left and you guys are 

717
00:35:56,931 --> 00:36:00,390
really in it together and it's a matter 
of keeping you just going home safe,

718
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,130
you know?
And so what's going to,

719
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,380
what is required in that situation?

720
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Well,
you got to shoot at the people in the 

721
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:09,380
other trench.
Um,

722
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,370
and so every,
so now obviously there are aspects of 

723
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,801
war making that don't fit that mold and 
some of the more disturbing aspects that

724
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,720
actually require less of us in terms of 
like you're dropping bombs from 30,000

725
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:26,721
feet or you're flying a drone from an 
office park out outside of Las Vegas or 

726
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:27,420
wherever they were,
wherever they are.

727
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,530
And so we find that customers telescopic
approach to war,

728
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,410
different ethically.
And I think it is,

729
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,140
it's different in a variety of ways that
are interesting,

730
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:41,370
but I think it's,
it's,

731
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,510
yeah,
it's not so much that that war unleashes

732
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:48,510
in most people,
this blood lust that is,

733
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,400
that they're,
you know,

734
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,410
they're struggling to contain in the 
civilized world and adjust that once 

735
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,810
the,
the tap is open in a foreign country,

736
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:02,811
you just have Rambo's everywhere that 
people are really conflicted about what 

737
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:06,300
they do and a lot of people try to not 
do anything of consequence.

738
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,470
There is a great episode of one of Dan 
Carlin's podcasts,

739
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:13,380
one of the hardcore history podcast 
about world war one,

740
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,880
and I believe it was about the Germans 
and the English that they had been in 

741
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:23,760
battle with each other and they had sort
of,

742
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:29,150
without verbally agreeing to this,
they had sort of agreed to a ceasefire 

743
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:30,410
during lunch.
Oh yeah.

744
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,190
It was fascinating.
Do you know the story?

745
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:32,790
Yeah.
Yeah,

746
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,380
please.
Because I've heard a,

747
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,980
I knew the story,
but I've also listened to Dan's podcast,

748
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:41,370
which is think I got from you.
It's just fantastic.

749
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:46,371
He's the best size.
I think that all of all of them are 

750
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:48,060
great,
but that series on world war one is just

751
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:49,350
a masterpiece.
It's just,

752
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,810
it's really,
um,

753
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,070
you know,
he's doing something remarkable there.

754
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,380
Um,
but yeah,

755
00:37:55,381 --> 00:38:00,381
that's where they,
this trench warfare was the most brutal 

756
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:01,860
of just,
it was just this,

757
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,340
uh,
you know,

758
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,420
horror compounded upon horror endlessly 
for years to no evident gain.

759
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,590
I mean,
these people,

760
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,650
they're there,
there fighting for yards of ground 

761
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,200
forever and just tens of thousands of 
people are,

762
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:21,650
are dying and they're,
they're basically camped out on the 

763
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,760
decomposing bodies of the people who 
died before them.

764
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,300
And there is just,
it's the most horrible version of 

765
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,181
warfare you've ever heard about.
And then there's this no man's land 

766
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:35,901
between the trenches where you know,
people who will kind of run out there 

767
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:39,621
trying to make an incursion into the 
enemy trench will get caught on barb or 

768
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:41,350
they'll get a shot and then you'll hit 
you.

769
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,940
So you have this spectacle of people 
injured and dying.

770
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:48,670
People in the no man's land between the 
trenches,

771
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:54,110
you know,
howling for hours and hours and hours 

772
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,461
and misery.
And when someone goes to try to rescue 

773
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:56,461
them,
they get shot and,

774
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,010
and so,
but there were periods where the,

775
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,640
the two sides just a agreed that this 
was just,

776
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:09,010
and again,
how that was communicated was kind of 

777
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,010
interesting.

778
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,010
I don't actually recall the details 
there,

779
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,651
but it was,
there was a kind of a tacit agreement 

780
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:13,651
that emerged where,
okay,

781
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,960
we're going to let you get your,
we're not going to shoot it to you when 

782
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:17,960
you get the,
the,

783
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,340
the,
the injured person or the dead bodies.

784
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,640
Um,
and there was one Christmas,

785
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,970
I believe where they just basically went
out and the exchange cigarettes and you 

786
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,541
know,
had an impromptu soccer game and they 

787
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,151
just,
they basically called the war off at a 

788
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:33,260
certain point and then got chastised by 
the higher ups for,

789
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,110
for doing that.
And then the war started all over again.

790
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,600
But yeah,
they actually socialized at one point.

791
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,100
It's amazing.
It really is an amazing depiction of 

792
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,160
what must have been an impossible place 
to be in,

793
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:52,430
to try to imagine being a person 
standing on the decomposing bodies for 

794
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,190
being forced to shit in a coffee cup.
And throw it over the top of the trench 

795
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,620
and I mean and know that no one's 
getting out of this.

796
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:05,990
I mean you might be one of a thousand 
people that's going to die in the next 

797
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,440
couple of hours.
You might be,

798
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:08,040
you know,
you,

799
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,320
you might make it to next week,
you might not.

800
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:15,321
I mean,
and just the stress that you're dealing 

801
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:18,231
with the,
the non human aspect of that life,

802
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,770
like this is not a normal thing that you
ever expected to deal with.

803
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
There's not a normal set of scenarios is
not your,

804
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:25,980
your,
your brain,

805
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,430
the way you grew up,
you are not prepared for this life.

806
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,190
You're just thrust into it and it 
doesn't make any sense.

807
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:37,191
And then to have that all sort of eroded
to the point where on Christmas you guys

808
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:43,050
are hanging out and then the,
the generals come in and say fuck this.

809
00:40:43,051 --> 00:40:48,051
You got to kill those people.
And next thing you were killing each 

810
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:48,051
other again.
Like,

811
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:48,880
so you have this brief glimpse of,
you know,

812
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,990
some utopia inside of,
of war.

813
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,390
Yeah.
Well,

814
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,290
what was so weird about that war in 
particular was that the run up to it was

815
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:02,291
so romanticized and idealistic.
I mean you had a kind of a war fever 

816
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,920
that,
that happened throughout Europe where 

817
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,650
this was just looked at as in the 
rosiest possible terms like this is just

818
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:16,940
the true glory of,
of manhood to be an expressed.

819
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:21,941
Finally we have a,
it's like it was approached like the 

820
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:25,870
World Cup or something.
I'm sure it was like pure exuberance 

821
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:25,870
around the prospect of fighting this 
war,

822
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,780
uh,
in many quarters.

823
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:31,781
And you know,
that you'd be surprised if that ever 

824
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,751
happened again.
And so it's a little bit like what's 

825
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:35,920
happening with Ge Jihadists,
but they have beliefs that,

826
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,000
that caused that to make more sense.
I mean,

827
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:43,001
they,
they believe they're gonna go to 

828
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:43,001
paradise when they get killed in this 
war.

829
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,080
So it's.
But it's hard to map your own psychology

830
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:50,081
onto the cream of,
of English youth where they were just 

831
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:53,120
just going off with this,
this level of enthusiasm,

832
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:58,121
having no idea or I guess part of it it 
was they had no idea just how horrible 

833
00:41:58,121 --> 00:41:58,121
it was going to be.

834
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,900
But they,
um,

835
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,550
yeah,
the,

836
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,270
it's,
you know,

837
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:06,530
you read homer and war is this glorious 
thing.

838
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,170
The,
the war ethic you get from,

839
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,290
from ancient civilizations is something 
that we have,

840
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:18,670
I think largely outgrown,
but you can really see it in world war 

841
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,340
one,
don't you think?

842
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:22,460
A lot of people had that similar 
attitude post nine slash 11,

843
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,580
especially when the World Trade Center 
towers went down and there was this flag

844
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:31,760
waving fewer in America unlike anything 
I'd ever seen.

845
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,350
I remember post 9:11.
I remember driving down the street.

846
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,540
I'm leaving the street near my house and
entering into this main street and every

847
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:45,800
car,
every car had an American flag.

848
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,660
Every car.
It was insane.

849
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,860
I mean,
it was,

850
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:49,310
uh,
if you,

851
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:50,900
if you did,
I didn't have an American flag.

852
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,690
I was looked at odd,
you know,

853
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,710
like this is,
this is,

854
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,740
this is an unprecedented time in history
and then all these people were signing 

855
00:42:59,740 --> 00:42:59,810
up for war.

856
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,730
All these people were signing up because
they wanted to go over there.

857
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:06,731
They wanted to fight the good fight,
and then you start hearing things from 

858
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:07,640
people like,
like Pat Tillman,

859
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:13,030
who left a career as an nfl player,
very promising career as a pro athlete 

860
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:19,061
and all of a sudden he's over there and 
this war and his impression of it was 

861
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:21,110
that it was acute clusterfuck.
It was nothing like what he wanted.

862
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,530
It was nothing like what he expected and
he was very verbal about that.

863
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:24,950
Very,
very,

864
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:30,430
very openly critical about that.
And a lot of people think that's one of 

865
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:30,430
the reasons why he died.
You know,

866
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,171
there's a giant conspiracy theory that 
they killed him because he was talking 

867
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:35,171
to him.
He's killed by friendly fire.

868
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:37,190
He was killed by American troops and 
there was.

869
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:42,191
The conspiracy theory was that they shut
him up because he was so openly critical

870
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:48,430
of what was going on over there,
that it wasn't what he thought it was 

871
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:48,430
going to be.

872
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,970
He thought it was going to be this 
incredibly organized group of heroes 

873
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:55,390
that went over there to fight these evil
bad guys that are held mountain 

874
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,140
destruction and suicide bombing their 
way into the America to kill the 

875
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,070
American dream mean.
This is the idealistic version of it.

876
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,670
Well,
I think there is an idealistic version 

877
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,620
of good and bad actors in this case.
It's just the reality of fighting this 

878
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:13,410
war is so messy and that it's.
Yeah,

879
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:14,690
it's,
it's you.

880
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:20,070
Afghanistan I think was pretty clear cut
morally that we had to do something 

881
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,581
against al Qaeda and by definition,
once the Taliban wouldn't release Osama 

882
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,950
bin Ladin to us,
we had to do something against the 

883
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,950
Taliban.
I mean,

884
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,950
that's.
He was.

885
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:33,830
And they were sheltering him.
Um,

886
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,380
and so I didn't,
I didn't feel ethically conflicted over 

887
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,760
that,
but that was such a mess.

888
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,860
I think you're,
you're so going into Afghanistan,

889
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,920
the reality of what it takes to go into 
Afghanistan and kill the bad guys is so 

890
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,900
messy that there's arguably no good way 
to do it.

891
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,980
There's no,
there's no way to do it,

892
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,040
which at the end of the day is going to 
look like a success.

893
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:01,250
And so the men,
maybe that's something we're now 

894
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:01,650
learning that you have to,
um,

895
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:06,300
this is so messy that you have to be,
you really have to pick your moments,

896
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,770
uh,
and the,

897
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,190
and the far more surgical than we've 
ever been inclined to be.

898
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:11,460
And,
and,

899
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:16,470
and,
and not even think about defeating the 

900
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,551
enemy ultimately,
but just kind of keeping the enemy at 

901
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,011
bay containing this problem for long 
enough to change minds or change culture

902
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,500
in science in some other way.
Because even in,

903
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,470
in this case,
I think it was,

904
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,200
it was very clear cut,
you know,

905
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:32,010
we're killing members of al Qaeda was,
was a good idea.

906
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:34,620
And I think it's still a good idea.
It's just,

907
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,560
you know,
you have a drone strike,

908
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,460
kills some of them and also kills some 
of the hostages as we now see.

909
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,460
And it also kills some of the people 
standing too close to the bomb blast and

910
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,950
it's ethically messy,
you know,

911
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,060
so it's,
it's at.

912
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:53,790
But I think there are instances of it 
that are certainly necessary,

913
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:58,791
but someone has to be thinking very 
clearly about how we proceed in a world 

914
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:02,790
where there really are people trying to 
destroy us.

915
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,950
It's not that there's,
there's no bad guys,

916
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,260
there are bad guys.
Um,

917
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,860
was that where the foreign policy 
argument comes into play because some 

918
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,981
people say those bad guys are bad guys 
because of us foreign policy because of 

919
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:20,141
the way we have intervened and dominated
really can natural resources.

920
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,840
You think it's confused?
Yeah.

921
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,870
Yeah.
So before we dive into that,

922
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,880
I'm looking at a list of topics that 
were brought up by our twitter people 

923
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,070
and I'm just,
I'm just gonna I'll read the list just 

924
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,230
so we have it in our heads and you can 
decide what you want to deal with here,

925
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:36,600
but Islam,
anything but Islam.

926
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,910
Abby Martin,
abby,

927
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,020
Martin,
Abby Martin.

928
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:45,060
Um,
so I think we have to deal with Abby 

929
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,060
Martin.
Abby,

930
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,320
who is a good friend.
I love abby.

931
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,890
She's crazy though,
uh,

932
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:49,560
in a good way,
but she's,

933
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,590
she's wild.
And she accused you of being one of the 

934
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:58,910
new atheists with your anti Islamic 
rhetoric and uh,

935
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,330
you know,
that's nothing new to you.

936
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,440
You accused of that in the past.
Um,

937
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,440
did she misrepresent your point of view?
Did you listen to it?

938
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:07,890
Yeah,
I did.

939
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,930
I did listen to it.
And should we play it or no?

940
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,560
I don't think you need,
you don't need that.

941
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,790
But what did she say and what would do 
not agree with what she said?

942
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:20,090
Well,
she said it was really interesting 

943
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,800
listening to her because.
So I listened to the whole podcast and 

944
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,310
she didn't mention me until like the 
second hour.

945
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,530
I'm,
I'm listening to this.

946
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:30,530
I'm thinking I'm actually,
I'm actually having a conversation with 

947
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,900
you in my head as I'm listening to this 
and I'm thinking and show you.

948
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,340
It's kind of remarkable what you are 
able to do here because you're having a 

949
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:37,340
conversation with her.
If I have,

950
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,870
from my point of view,
you were just drinking from a firehose 

951
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:41,870
of bullshit,
right?

952
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,670
It's just like she is what she's saying 
the so much wrong with what she's saying

953
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,360
and,
but yet you're in a position to have a 

954
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,120
conversation with her.
That is where there's just like a ton of

955
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:57,121
goodwill and it doesn't run to the 
digital and you can have a conversation 

956
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,560
with me in the same vein,
but then I was thinking I could not.

957
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,540
I mean,
I'm sure she's a perfectly nice person 

958
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:05,540
and I would,
you know,

959
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:05,620
I would,
I would be very nice talking to her,

960
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:10,621
but I,
I have a feeling now of more or less 

961
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:14,530
total hopelessness,
talking to someone as polarized on these

962
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:17,090
issues as,
as I view her to be a.

963
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:22,150
and so I was kind of praising you in my 
mind thinking that I couldn't do what 

964
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,820
you're doing here.
At that instance,

965
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,970
she just mentioned me,
right?

966
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,450
So it's like,
it was like one of those bad scenes in a

967
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,660
movie where he let the television starts
talking to the,

968
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,950
to the character.
She just,

969
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,980
she just kind of called me out and then 
represented more or less totally 

970
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,010
misrepresented my views.
Um,

971
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,550
so,
so she said,

972
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,890
she said many things that are just 
inaccurate,

973
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,120
which we can talk about,
but,

974
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,480
but in terms of,
uh,

975
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:53,070
what she attributes to me,
she said that I only care about 

976
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:54,640
intentions,
right?

977
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,810
So that all intentions are all that 
matters.

978
00:48:56,811 --> 00:49:00,460
So if we kill a billion people but meant
well,

979
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,320
we're fine and if and if,
if the Muslims kill a million people but

980
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,290
don't mean well,
they're far worse than we are ethically.

981
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,630
And that's intentions are all that 
matter.

982
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:13,570
And she was,
I think in her defense.

983
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:13,930
I mean,
she's,

984
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:16,120
I'm sure she's never read anything I've 
written,

985
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:21,121
but she was reacting to a snippet of a,
a podcast where I push back against some

986
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,330
of the things that Noam Chomsky has 
said.

987
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,840
Um,
and I have,

988
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,120
I haven't thought that I,
I've,

989
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,110
I've said in my first book that Chomsky 
doesn't value intent,

990
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,730
the,
the ethical role of intentions enough.

991
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:37,360
And I said something very brief in a 
podcast that bounced around.

992
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:40,000
And so that's what you heard.
So she misconstrued me,

993
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:42,310
their intentions are not all that 
matters,

994
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:45,250
obviously,
but intentions do matter.

995
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,740
So if someone,
if someone stabs you right,

996
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,860
the difference between them doing it on 
purpose because they want to kill you 

997
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,950
and then doing it by accident because 
they were cutting,

998
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,350
you know,
you guys were cooking in the kitchen and

999
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:00,400
they didn't know you were there.

1000
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,500
They turned and they stuck a knife into 
your belly.

1001
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,030
Um,
it's,

1002
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:07,150
it's a world of difference ethically,
right?

1003
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:07,840
So,
and,

1004
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:12,850
and the,
the crucial difference is the person's 

1005
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:17,551
intentions tell you a tremendous amount 
about what they're likely to do in the 

1006
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:21,451
future.
The Guy who stabbed you once because he 

1007
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,320
wants to kill you is very likely going 
to stab you again until you're dead,

1008
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:23,680
right?
I mean,

1009
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:25,240
he's trying to kill you.
The,

1010
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,660
your friend in the kitchen who stabbed 
you by accident is going to be rushing 

1011
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,070
you to the hospital in the next 
instance.

1012
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:35,240
This is a kind of addition dent,
disingenuous comparison because I mean,

1013
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:40,241
are you describing the difference 
between accidentally killing civilians 

1014
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:43,451
with us with a,
like a surgical strike in quotes of a 

1015
00:50:43,451 --> 00:50:47,240
drone strike versus killing someone with
a suicide bomb?

1016
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,750
What are you trying to kill as many 
people that are random as possible.

1017
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:55,750
So I'm just,
I'm using a very idealized example just 

1018
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,691
to show you that the role of intention 
is not all that matters because getting 

1019
00:50:58,691 --> 00:50:59,630
stabbed still sucks.
Right?

1020
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:03,660
So if you assume the same stab wounds,
you still have the same problem,

1021
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,900
but one of them,
one of your scenarios is completely 

1022
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:08,900
innocent and accidental.
Yeah.

1023
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:08,900
The other one is murderous intent.
Okay.

1024
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,290
So,
so those are,

1025
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,490
those are the extremes,
right?

1026
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:13,340
So then you can have gradations along 
that continuum,

1027
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,400
right where you have,
and some were more in the middle would 

1028
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,101
be you're trying to kill a bad guy and 
you accidentally killing it on the same 

1029
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:21,101
person as well.
Absolutely.

1030
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:21,101
And,
and it's,

1031
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:25,801
it's totally an or,
or you or you think you've got the bad 

1032
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:26,510
guy and you've just got bad intelligence
and you just,

1033
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,320
all you kill isn't innocent person,
right?

1034
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:34,180
You could be,
let's say you were being totally 

1035
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,180
surgical.

1036
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,130
You're a sniper.
You're going to just kill one person 

1037
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,651
with one bullet,
but you've got the wrong person through 

1038
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:41,351
no fault of your own right or worse yet 
the bullet goes through that person and 

1039
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:41,351
kill someone else.
Oh,

1040
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:42,790
so all kinds of scenarios like that.
And,

1041
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:45,170
and they're,
they're very common scenario I think,

1042
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:48,950
which is your bombing,
the bad guy.

1043
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:53,951
You're reasonably sure you're bombing 
the bad guy and he really is the bad 

1044
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:56,771
guy,
but you're also reasonably sure that 

1045
00:51:56,771 --> 00:52:00,041
you're going to injure or kill some 
innocent people and you're okay with 

1046
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:04,991
that because the reality of fighting war
is you never get the bad guy standing 

1047
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:09,230
all alone 500 yards from the next 
person.

1048
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,280
So if you can,
if you want to fight this war with 

1049
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,351
drones,
say you have to accept some level of 

1050
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:18,110
collateral damage.
Now I don't actually,

1051
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:21,500
I mean I am not privy to any kind of 
intelligence,

1052
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:21,950
you know,
I'm not,

1053
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,700
I'm not in those circles and I'm not,
I'm not one of those people,

1054
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:30,701
so I don't know just how Obama or anyone
in a position of responsibility makes 

1055
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,640
those calculations what is acceptable 
collateral damage,

1056
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:39,641
but we know that some level of 
collateral damage is acceptable because 

1057
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:42,410
otherwise it would be impossible to 
fight war at all.

1058
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,250
Right.
So a,

1059
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,190
we know that some level of collateral 
damage is acceptable.

1060
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,580
Just driving on our roads.
We 30,000

1061
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:54,581
people die every year on our roads.
We could dial that number down to zero.

1062
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,320
Right.
If you,

1063
00:52:56,321 --> 00:53:01,321
if,
if we were committed to no death on our 

1064
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:01,321
roads,
we could get there.

1065
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:02,360
We would just all have to drive five 
miles an hour.

1066
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,390
Right.
But the difference is that when you're 

1067
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:07,390
driving,
you're not intending on someone.

1068
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,960
It's an unintended consequences that 
transportation is a big difference 

1069
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,230
between that and the unintended 
consequence of violence.

1070
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,530
So we'll know which is definitely.
Let's get into that.

1071
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:16,550
Let's see it.
Let's see if there is.

1072
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:21,450
This is an unintended consequence,
unintended but foreseeable consequence,

1073
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:26,451
in fact,
certain consequence of our keeping the 

1074
00:53:26,451 --> 00:53:26,580
speed where it is,
right?

1075
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:29,540
You and I both know like let's say we 
could vote,

1076
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,230
vote on this,
you know,

1077
00:53:30,231 --> 00:53:31,410
what do you want the speed limit to be?

1078
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:31,980
It's,
you know,

1079
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:36,690
let's say it's 75 miles an hour.
We know that if we reduced it to five,

1080
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,920
there'd be some other costs and,
and I'm sure there'd be some other ways 

1081
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,591
in which people might die.
It would be harder to get you an 

1082
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:45,930
ambulance,
get into the hospital,

1083
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,140
would be hitting a traffic jam and some 
people would die on the way the hospital

1084
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:51,030
site.
But leave that aside,

1085
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,420
we would save tens of thousands of lives
every year if we just took all the fun 

1086
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,410
out of driving and,
or just forget about that,

1087
00:53:58,411 --> 00:54:00,660
forget about it.
Let's keep the speed limit exactly where

1088
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:04,890
it is,
but no matter what car you have,

1089
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,920
there's a governor on it and you cannot 
go past the legal speed limit ever.

1090
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,750
Right?
So if you're in a 25 mile an hour zone,

1091
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:18,180
know whatever your car is,
you've got a porsche or whatever you 

1092
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,180
like to drive.

1093
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,900
It can only go 25 miles an hour,
not a,

1094
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,080
not a,
I'm a mile and hour more,

1095
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:27,590
no matter how he hit the throttle.
And that would be true in every zone 

1096
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,580
there.
People would resist that and their 

1097
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,860
reasons for resisting it is just that it
wouldn't be driving will be less fun 

1098
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,290
right now.
That is a.

1099
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,770
If anything is indefensible when you're 
talking about kids being killed,

1100
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:43,790
that is right as a,
as a far more superficial commitment 

1101
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:48,260
than wanting to get the higher ups in Al
Qaeda who are trying to at some point 

1102
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,650
blow up an American city.
Right?

1103
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,740
But imagine if as many innocent people 
died from driving from one activity,

1104
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,950
like think about the amount of people 
that die.

1105
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,660
They do,
but they don't.

1106
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,670
They do,
but the numbers are nowhere near.

1107
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,300
What about the numbers,
numbers,

1108
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,060
numbers,
numbers.

1109
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:11,190
What are the percentage of people that 
have in it died?

1110
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,630
The innocent people that have died 
because of drones more than 80 percent.

1111
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:17,700
More than 80 percent.
I don't actually.

1112
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,610
I just have to plead ignorance on that.
I don't know those numbers.

1113
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,860
They're crazy.
They're very high or very high,

1114
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,580
but.
But hold on.

1115
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:23,800
Wait,
wait,

1116
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,420
wait for a second.
Because you were talking about something

1117
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,000
like driving for $30,000
a year.

1118
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:31,560
Every year.
Reliably.

1119
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,810
Last 10 years has been 300,000
people.

1120
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:39,470
How many people who drive on a daily 
basis wind up driving their whole life 

1121
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,050
and never killing anybody?
Most.

1122
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,050
Most.
Well how many drone strikes,

1123
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:48,230
but that's why.
How many drones trikes wind up not 

1124
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,230
killing innocent people.
Almost none,

1125
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,170
but that's not necessarily the way to 
analyze it or at least I would argue 

1126
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,881
that's not the way,
but let's just talk about numbers for 

1127
00:55:55,881 --> 00:55:58,401
instance,
because another problem I had with Abby 

1128
00:55:58,401 --> 00:56:00,831
Martin,
she was using this number $2 million 

1129
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:01,110
debt in Iraq and Afghanistan.

1130
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:06,110
Where did she get that number?
There's no that no credible person is 

1131
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:09,831
using that number.
What do you think the number is the 

1132
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:09,831
number?
Almost certainly in order million.

1133
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:09,980
No,
no.

1134
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,060
That.
That number is almost certainly an order

1135
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:16,440
of magnitude to high it in the sober 
estimates are like 200,000

1136
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,980
and most of that most is the result of 
sectarian violence,

1137
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,040
right?
It's not,

1138
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,610
we didn't kill 200,000
people.

1139
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:29,590
We went in to Iraq and this if of we're 
mostly talking about Iraq,

1140
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,260
that the numbers are much higher there 
than an Afghanistan.

1141
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,040
We went into Iraq.
We,

1142
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,040
we did some very stupid,
understandable things and also some very

1143
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,280
stupid things,
but we took the lid off of a,

1144
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,640
a simmering civil war that the real 
catastrophe of rack apart from our going

1145
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,860
in in the first place,
which I never supported.

1146
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,460
But the real catastrophe is that having 
gone in,

1147
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:59,970
we failed to anticipate the level of 
sectarian hatred and we did very little 

1148
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,350
to,
to hedge against it.

1149
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,220
And we kicked off a civil war which 
someone like Abby Martin,

1150
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:08,710
clearly things we are entirely 
responsible for.

1151
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:10,240
So when we know when she,
uh,

1152
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:14,650
death squads are taken out,
the power drills and drilling holes into

1153
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:18,550
the heads of their neighbors and the 
Sunni or returning the favor,

1154
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,010
that's us.
We are culpable for that.

1155
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:22,050
Now I don't accept that,
uh,

1156
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:27,060
these people were there,
they're killing one and they've got a 

1157
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:31,801
blood feud going back over a millennium 
now and we pop the cork on it in Iraq 

1158
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:39,270
and that's a terrible thing to have have
collaborated in and we probably 

1159
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,690
should've foreseen it.
So if we're culpable,

1160
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:45,190
it's for not having anticipated certain 
of these consequences of our actions,

1161
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:48,160
but we are not the people.
We are not the Sunni,

1162
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:50,830
her killing Shia and we're not the Shia,
Herculean,

1163
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,000
Sunni.
And the same is true in,

1164
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,160
in Afghanistan.

1165
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,580
We are not the Taliban who,
who,

1166
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:01,650
who are blowing themselves up in crowds 
of fellow Afghans as a way of making 

1167
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,980
their country ungovernable so that we 
have to leave right now.

1168
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:10,981
Again,
you could fault us for not having 

1169
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:12,751
anticipated this closely enough and or,
or done something effective to prevent 

1170
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:13,930
it.
And ironically,

1171
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:18,760
which faulting faultiness for in that 
case probably in Iraq is once we saw how

1172
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,520
bad this was getting,
you're faulting us for leaving,

1173
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:26,521
right?
You the argument there is the 

1174
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:28,171
compassionate thing to have done there.
If insofar as we could have anticipated 

1175
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:32,101
the rise of Isis and all of the that you
just this consequent death hold death 

1176
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:37,620
toll,
you're faulting us for leaving because 

1177
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:41,371
we,
because our political interests and our 

1178
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:42,880
stomach was no longer aligned with this 
project and you know,

1179
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:47,940
so that's the,
I'm not sure that's an argument that 

1180
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,771
someone like Abby Martin wants to make,
that we should have stayed longer than 

1181
00:58:49,771 --> 00:58:52,321
we should've spent more money than that 
we should have killed more people in an 

1182
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:55,960
effort to keep the locals from killing 
so many more people.

1183
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,670
So anyway,
this,

1184
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,440
the,
the number 2 million is plucked out of a

1185
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,870
bad dream.
I don't know where she got 2 million who

1186
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:07,040
was setting up,
I don't know anything to 100 than me.

1187
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,920
Obviously you're not going over there 
counting bodies.

1188
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,040
So who was saying it's $200,000?
Who's saying it's 2 million?

1189
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:12,700
Okay.
Well,

1190
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:17,850
so I'll tell you I'm the highest number 
that at one point seemed credible,

1191
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:24,380
was based on a Lancet article.
Lancet is a British medical journal,

1192
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,220
very well regarded,
but it has something.

1193
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,000
Jamie just put this up on the screen 
here,

1194
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:33,110
what is this from Jamie rack body,
so that's 200,000,

1195
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,960
but what is,
who was making this Iraq body count?

1196
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:37,910
Dot Org website.
It says,

1197
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,360
let's read what it says,
documented civilian deaths from 

1198
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:43,360
violence.
One hundred and 38,000

1199
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,771
to 156,000
total violent deaths including 

1200
00:59:47,771 --> 00:59:50,530
combatants 211,000
and this is a.

1201
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,580
What is this up from says from following
the 2003 invasion,

1202
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:56,770
but is this different?

1203
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,740
I think this is total counting.
They keep counting.

1204
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:03,470
So there are different ways to do this.
One is you can,

1205
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,050
you can count bodies,
right?

1206
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:11,051
And and the information there is not 
perfect because some people die and 

1207
01:00:11,051 --> 01:00:11,120
their death doesn't get reported.
You know,

1208
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,810
not everyone has a death certificate so 
you can count,

1209
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:20,050
you can count bodies,
you can get reports of of of the actual 

1210
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:25,660
deaths.
The other thing you can do is you can 

1211
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,791
estimate the amount of death that would 
have occurred in the absence of an 

1212
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,991
invasion and then compare the rate,
the reports of a statistical sample of 

1213
01:00:32,871 --> 01:00:36,860
an area and compare the reports of death
based on the past based on,

1214
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:41,861
yeah,
based on what's happening now and you 

1215
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:43,991
see a differential there and then you 
extrapolate to the rest of the 

1216
01:00:43,991 --> 01:00:44,770
population and so that's what the 
authors of this Lancet article,

1217
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,810
they did that and they came up with a 
number,

1218
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:53,050
a 600 or 650,000
and that article has been widely 

1219
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,100
criticized.

1220
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,620
Not to the point of it being 
unpublished,

1221
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:02,621
but I don't think it's been retracted,
but I don't think any serious person 

1222
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,450
thinks that article is representative of
the facts.

1223
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:08,390
And so what they did for instances they 
they took.

1224
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:13,450
They would take a cluster of I think 40 
homes in an area and asked the people 

1225
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,230
who has died,
who do you know who has to,

1226
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,880
who has died and how did they die,
and then they would get.

1227
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:25,570
They would just based on that sample.
They do that in many different sites 

1228
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:26,330
around Iraq.
Based on those samples,

1229
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:29,950
they will extrapolate to the rest of the
population and they came up with $600,

1230
01:01:29,951 --> 01:01:34,951
650,000.
So one criticism I read about that 

1231
01:01:34,951 --> 01:01:38,621
article was that they,
they seem to have focused on areas in 

1232
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:43,550
near major thoroughfares in big cities 
where you know,

1233
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,680
where I eds were far more common than 
other places and in those same cities or

1234
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:50,120
in other places in Iraq.

1235
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,700
So like so places like the very place 
you would,

1236
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:58,180
you would most likely plant an Iud is a,
is a non especially representative place

1237
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:04,811
to poll all the families in the area to 
see whether they've lost loved ones in 

1238
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:04,811
the war.
Right.

1239
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:09,251
So that,
that was one way to get an unrealistic 

1240
01:02:09,251 --> 01:02:09,670
number.
The other thing is that the,

1241
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,680
it seemed that there were just some 
shady things with the researchers where 

1242
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,591
they weren't releasing their data,
their and their methods and the 

1243
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:18,080
communication with them broke down.
And so anyway,

1244
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,950
the sober people trust who focus on 
these things,

1245
01:02:20,951 --> 01:02:23,550
I think that's a fictional number.
And that's one third,

1246
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:25,320
not even one third of what abby is 
working with.

1247
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:26,700
Excuse me.

1248
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,870
I think I caught Arboreta.
It's cold.

1249
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,270
Just just watching that podcast,
I think I got his goal.

1250
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:37,590
I think that we can agree that even 
200,000

1251
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,200
people dead is a tremendous tragedy.
Horrific,

1252
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:45,201
tremendous tragedy.
So was the semantics argument over 

1253
01:02:45,201 --> 01:02:49,011
whether or not it's tenfold that number 
or whatever it is you just disagree 

1254
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:50,630
with?
That's not okay.

1255
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:54,050
Manix is a bad word.
Tenfold,

1256
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,290
tenfold.
And,

1257
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:00,060
but even more important is we didn't go 
in and kill 200,000

1258
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:02,490
people.
We went in and killed,

1259
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,180
I'm sure some tens of thousands of 
people,

1260
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,730
many of whom were were,
you know,

1261
01:03:09,731 --> 01:03:12,450
the baptist,
the Revolutionary Guard.

1262
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:17,451
Right.
And we unleashed a Maelstrom of internet

1263
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,300
dating,
sectarian conflict,

1264
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:26,450
religious conflict,
and we fail to contain it and it would 

1265
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,770
have taken more blood and treasure to 
contain it.

1266
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:31,290
And um,
so it's,

1267
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,370
it's a,
it's a huge problem.

1268
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:34,260
I'm not minimizing the horror of Iraq.

1269
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:34,730
I can,
I,

1270
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:39,780
I never supported our invasion of Iraq,
the things I've said that have been spun

1271
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,880
as supportive it are drawn from 
conversations with the sort that you and

1272
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:46,020
I are having now.
So if for instance,

1273
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:48,450
I've said things like,
am I might've been on your podcast,

1274
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:50,690
I said at one point,
um,

1275
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:55,110
even if we had gone into Iraq for purely
humanitarian reasons,

1276
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:55,500
right?
Let's,

1277
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:59,430
we're going to go in to remove Saddam.
He's a criminal,

1278
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:02,640
he's a psychopath.
This was a hostage situation.

1279
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,940
We're going to get him out of there and 
we're just going to dump money on these 

1280
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,941
people to commit to so that the standard
of living rises to something like Marin 

1281
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:11,610
County.
Right?

1282
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:13,890
So this is our goal.
That's actually our intention,

1283
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,930
right?
Even if that were the intention,

1284
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:21,410
it still would've been a nightmare.
We still would have been unleashed the 

1285
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:21,410
sectarian horror.

1286
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,230
We still would have had suicide bombers 
against us.

1287
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,300
Now I believe that to be true,
right?

1288
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:29,570
So I say something like that and some 
people listen to this conversation and 

1289
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:29,570
they say,
well,

1290
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:32,400
Sam thinks that we went into a rack for 
humanitarian reasons.

1291
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:35,040
He thinks we went into a rack just to 
make it like marine county.

1292
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:40,041
Right.
So that's the sort of pushback I get 

1293
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:40,041
from the Abbey Martins of the world.
No,

1294
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:40,041
I've never,
I've never said that.

1295
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:44,751
I'm just saying that,
that the truth is so sinister that even 

1296
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:48,471
if our intentions were perfectly benign 
and we're just trying to raise the 

1297
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:50,910
standard of living there and make,
you know,

1298
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:53,550
even just give them the freedom to 
practice their own religion.

1299
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,560
Right.
So we're trying to make this like 

1300
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:58,560
Nebraska,
um,

1301
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,640
it would have been a bloodbath given the
beliefs of,

1302
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,880
of sorts of people who now populate a 
group like Isis.

1303
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,280
So anyway,
that's,

1304
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:12,330
that's my claim.
So this is just one aspect of what you 

1305
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:13,110
disagreed with.
What she said.

1306
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:13,470
Well,
it just,

1307
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,070
so her 2 million number,
the 2 million down to the ground.

1308
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,820
I mean she's,
she's just has this,

1309
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,670
she's a lefty.
She,

1310
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:25,671
she's well shoot,
but she has a kind of confabulatory 

1311
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:25,671
style.
Again,

1312
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:26,260
I'm not really denigrating her 
personally,

1313
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:27,700
but I don't know her.
I'm sure she's,

1314
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,760
she's a good person,
but there's a style of talking that you 

1315
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,151
run into with people where there's just.
It's kind of confabulatory we're just 

1316
01:05:36,151 --> 01:05:39,340
sort of talking and it sounded good and 
you're just sort of spitballing,

1317
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,460
but you're using numbers,
right?

1318
01:05:40,461 --> 01:05:45,461
You're new,
you're using numbers like 2 million or 

1319
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:47,191
you're saying things like,
our biggest export is weapons.

1320
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,280
The landmark research proves the US led 
war on terror has killed as many as 2 

1321
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,390
million people,
but this is a fraction of the western 

1322
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:57,610
responsibility for deaths in Iraq and 
Afghanistan over the last two decades.

1323
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:02,640
Last month,
Washington DC based Physicians for 

1324
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,550
social responsibility released a 
landmark study concluding that the death

1325
01:06:03,551 --> 01:06:08,551
toll from 10 years of the war on terror 
since the nine slash 11 attacks is at 

1326
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:10,690
least one point $3 million.
It could be as high as $2 million and we

1327
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:11,910
just finished it just so we can get to 
it.

1328
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:16,970
90 seven page report by the Nobel Peace 
Prize winning doctor's group is the 

1329
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:20,851
first to tally up the total number of 
civilian casualties from the US led 

1330
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:23,920
counterterrorism interventions in Iraq,
Afghanistan,

1331
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:25,140
and Pakistan.
Right.

1332
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:25,990
Okay,
well,

1333
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:30,991
so,
so clearly that's where she got this 

1334
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:33,301
number.
She got it from somebody who got over 

1335
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:33,301
there.
Um,

1336
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:36,280
I think that number is the sorts of 
people I taught.

1337
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:41,281
So for instance,
when I as a sanity check when I heard 

1338
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:44,010
Abby Martin,
I sent an email to my friend Steven 

1339
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:46,240
pinker who is an incredibly sober 
scientist.

1340
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,540
I'm just a very careful researcher.

1341
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,410
He was,
he wrote this truly landmark book on the

1342
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:58,411
decline of violence in the last century 
that the better angels of our nature 

1343
01:06:58,411 --> 01:07:00,610
came out a few years ago.
He was like 800 pages on this topic,

1344
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,180
very data driven book.
And uh,

1345
01:07:03,181 --> 01:07:08,181
he's,
he did a tremendous amount of research 

1346
01:07:08,181 --> 01:07:08,320
for this and he's,
um,

1347
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:13,630
he's an incredibly well respected 
Harvard scientist.

1348
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:18,870
So I pinged him about this and I said,
I'm hearing in liberal circles that we 

1349
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,190
killed 2 million people in,
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

1350
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,090
Sir,
is there any chance that this is true?

1351
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,550
And he bailed.
He said,

1352
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:26,780
more or less.
What I'm saying to you now that this is,

1353
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:29,950
it's almost certainly in order of 
magnitude too high,

1354
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,750
the highest briefly credible study was 
the lands that one that was,

1355
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:35,800
I don't know,
I'm,

1356
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:41,010
I didn't know about this and I don't 
know what he in particular would say 

1357
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:44,281
about this study,
but undoubtedly they use the same sort 

1358
01:07:44,281 --> 01:07:44,281
of extrapolation methods.

1359
01:07:44,281 --> 01:07:45,360
They're not counting bodies.
They're there,

1360
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:50,290
they're doing based on where the ambient
level of death over the years.

1361
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,800
They think it's gone up by the tune of 2
million,

1362
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,280
uh,
in those,

1363
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,170
in those countries.
Um,

1364
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:56,980
but anyway,
so,

1365
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,830
so Steve said,
no,

1366
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:04,831
this is,
this is a totally fanciful number and 

1367
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,010
here's why.
And he broke it down for me.

1368
01:08:06,011 --> 01:08:09,430
And then I did,
did a little more reading on the topic,

1369
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,740
the,
but again,

1370
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:16,741
the crucial,
I think it really matters whether the 

1371
01:08:16,741 --> 01:08:16,880
number is 200,000
or 2 million.

1372
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:21,881
I don't want to be loose on that.
But the crucial ethical difference is 

1373
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:28,030
did we go in and perform our own sort of
final solution against the Iraqis and 

1374
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:32,981
the Afghanistans trying Afghanis trying 
to kill millions of people a Hitler or 

1375
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:39,910
did we wander into a situation where we 
unleashed a civil war and are we 

1376
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:43,700
culpable for that and I don't think we 
are.

1377
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,190
We're culpable for something,
but we're not.

1378
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,280
We are not the Sunni's killing the Shia 
and vice versa.

1379
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:51,080
You believe that that is the majority 
of.

1380
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:52,370
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1381
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,890
I don't know if that necessarily the new
study necessarily agrees with that.

1382
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:56,820
I'm sure.
Well,

1383
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,840
I.
I would be astonished if they didn't 

1384
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:01,850
that Lancet study.
It says it's,

1385
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:05,750
it's likely to be far more accurate than
the figures initially.

1386
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,610
Which study is likely to be the 200,001,
655,000

1387
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,140
deaths.
So wait a minute.

1388
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:14,150
The people who were saying it may be 2 
million,

1389
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:19,151
but it's at least 100.
According to the PSR started the must 

1390
01:09:19,151 --> 01:09:22,360
disputed Lancet Study Lancet study that 
estimated 500,

1391
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:24,390
655,000.
I us up to two,

1392
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,890
2006 and over a million until today by 
extrapolation was likely to be far more 

1393
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:32,540
accurate than the IBCs figure.
In fact,

1394
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:37,160
there were four can confirms a virtual 
consensus among among epod,

1395
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:42,370
demolish a epidemiologist on the 
reliability of the Atlanta is coming 

1396
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,350
from the so I don't want to totally.

1397
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,110
I'm not saying I'm not open to this 
information,

1398
01:09:48,111 --> 01:09:53,111
but the website you are pulling this 
from is just just trash,

1399
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,670
right?
Middle East is just.

1400
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:56,470
I mean this.
This is the.

1401
01:09:56,550 --> 01:10:00,830
These guys publish the serial plagiarist
who's been stalking me,

1402
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:04,050
who I vowed not to name.
I missed.

1403
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,270
Just the stuff they publish is just pure
insanity.

1404
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:12,400
I mean Google me on this site and you'll
get madness jobs,

1405
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:15,050
so they're.
They're talking about a study.

1406
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:18,590
They didn't perform the steps,
but I can't publish it in real time.

1407
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:21,890
I can vet their representatives that 
study and see who the hell.

1408
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,130
Who was at say perform that study.
I can't read that.

1409
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:29,420
PSR physicians the social response.
So that's a real group.

1410
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:34,510
But again,
the problem only one problem here is 

1411
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:38,111
that this whole area has become so 
politicized that it's hard to even,

1412
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:44,830
you know,
like Amnesty International has 

1413
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,740
embarrassed itself with supporting a 
jihadist organization in the UK and they

1414
01:10:46,741 --> 01:10:50,210
just at the 11th hour pulled out their 
support,

1415
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,240
but the,
for,

1416
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:56,270
for a very long time,
they were just in the same trench with 

1417
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:57,310
jihadists and not knowing it or,
or,

1418
01:10:57,311 --> 01:10:58,250
or they should have known it.

1419
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,630
I mean people were telling them,
but they were still,

1420
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:02,060
they were very slow to realize it.
So I don't,

1421
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:03,260
you know,
you don't know,

1422
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,260
um,
you should be slow to,

1423
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,080
to,
uh,

1424
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:12,340
take even a humanitarian organizations 
word for the significance of a given 

1425
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:13,970
study.
Um,

1426
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,010
but,
you know,

1427
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:21,020
I would find,
I would find it frankly amazing if we 

1428
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,630
had killed anything like that number of 
people and why.

1429
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,820
Well,
I would,

1430
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:29,880
I would find it amazing if that number 
of people had died,

1431
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:30,820
I would find it.
I,

1432
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:31,230
it's,
it's,

1433
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,480
it's unthinkable to me that we killed 2 
million people.

1434
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:39,120
It's over 12 years of war.
But even if you killed,

1435
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,480
you know,
mentally you just know where all this 

1436
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:44,480
death is coming from,
you know,

1437
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,450
where the bombings that the Iud is,
that truck bombs that,

1438
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:50,610
the blowing up of mosques,
we're not doing that.

1439
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:55,820
Right.
So that's the body count when you look 

1440
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:55,820
at,
when you look at the penalty,

1441
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,871
we're paying for killing people and when
we look at how much we don't have our 

1442
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:08,511
own soldiers don't want to die 
unnecessarily in our own cabinet level 

1443
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:08,511
of casualties.

1444
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:12,670
We're not on the,
on the other,

1445
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:17,690
on the other side of all those guns.
I mean we've done just a tremendous 

1446
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:21,021
amount of internet seeing violence in 
both Afghanistan and Iraq and that is 

1447
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:22,130
just killing,
you know,

1448
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:26,130
like a bomb will go off and 100 people 
at a mosque will be dead.

1449
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:30,120
So Abby Martin,
I think,

1450
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,460
I don't think I'm being uncharitable 
here.

1451
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:35,730
I think she thinks we're responsible for
that,

1452
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,530
for the Sunni Shia violence.
Yes.

1453
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,660
Okay.
So whatever the number is,

1454
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,640
that's,
that's your argument with that.

1455
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:44,790
You were saying that I was swimming in a
sea of bullshit before that,

1456
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,830
right?
What else was bullshit?

1457
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:48,450
Well,
I think,

1458
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:49,520
um,
I,

1459
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,020
I don't remember all the details,
but.

1460
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:57,021
So for instance,
one thing she said is that our main 

1461
01:12:57,021 --> 01:12:57,021
export his arms,
that's not true.

1462
01:12:57,021 --> 01:12:58,320
That's not true.
That's not true.

1463
01:12:58,321 --> 01:13:00,900
So it may be what does our main export.

1464
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,510
I think our main export is like 
machinery,

1465
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,610
like everything,
everything you like,

1466
01:13:05,611 --> 01:13:09,880
farming equipment and pumps and road 
making those corn.

1467
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,460
That was a guess.
I think it's technically know it's,

1468
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:17,530
I think it's airplanes and I mean 
everything they find out everything 

1469
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:20,010
that's a machine I think is.
So maybe arms falls into that category,

1470
01:13:20,011 --> 01:13:25,011
but when you look at machines,
number one to $119,000,000,000

1471
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:29,340
in machines,
13 point five percent of total exports.

1472
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:30,780
Number two,
electronic equipment,

1473
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:33,930
171 billion oil,
$157 billion.

1474
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:38,931
Number three vehicles,
$135 billion number for aircrafts and 

1475
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,410
spacecrafts,
$124.

1476
01:13:40,411 --> 01:13:41,340
Billion.
Number six,

1477
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:43,500
medical tech,
net technical equipment,

1478
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:46,560
84 billion.
Number seven gems,

1479
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:49,170
precious metals and coins,
65 billion.

1480
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:50,460
That's interesting.
Number Eight,

1481
01:13:50,461 --> 01:13:53,160
plastics,
63 billion.

1482
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,960
Number nine,
pharmaceuticals,

1483
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:57,720
43 billion coming in strong with the 
Viagra.

1484
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:03,020
Number 10 organic chemical.
So guns aren't even in the top 10 

1485
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:03,360
machines.
Yeah,

1486
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:05,830
but I'm sure that.
Well you got,

1487
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:11,140
you have to think that weaponry is 
somehow spread across aircraft machines 

1488
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:13,290
and aircraft vehicles.

1489
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:13,870
I,
well,

1490
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,680
I mean I'll cut her the,
the benefit of the doubt there that be 

1491
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,121
there is because you know that,
that let's find a more comprehensive 

1492
01:14:23,121 --> 01:14:25,561
list that actually includes arms because
it seemed that that's pretty sneaky as 

1493
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:29,630
if it is machines and she might be 
somehow or another will say it's export,

1494
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,000
you know,
$50,000,000,000

1495
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:33,880
in arms a year.
I don't know what it is,

1496
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:36,430
but it's um,
and that's,

1497
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:38,950
that's a whole nother conversation 
whether we should be doing that.

1498
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:43,951
I think that's suicidally stupid in 
certain cases that we're arming people 

1499
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:48,010
who are eventually going to be using 
these arms against us or our friends.

1500
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:53,011
But conspiracy theory would be that 
that's how they perpetuate this whole 

1501
01:14:53,011 --> 01:14:54,400
constant cycle of war.
So you have to keep arming your random.

1502
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,800
Well No.
So I think the economic interests of 

1503
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,871
defense contractors is not something 
that I am especially sanguine about.

1504
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:05,020
It's not,
you know,

1505
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,400
I think that the,
the,

1506
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:11,820
the role of the possible role of 
corruption there and a concert of 

1507
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:16,180
callous indifference to the effects of,
of being in this business.

1508
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:17,980
I think that's,
that's a very real concern.

1509
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:23,970
But so to say that we,
this is our main export is bombs 

1510
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:25,420
essentially.
That's not true.

1511
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:30,450
Now maybe what she meant to say is we 
are the main export of weaponry in the 

1512
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:31,980
world.
It's probably just,

1513
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,330
which is probably true,
but that's not what she said.

1514
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,460
Or maybe she said both and I only heard 
one.

1515
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:41,790
No,
I think you're correct in what she said 

1516
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:41,790
she might be getting.
You know,

1517
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,000
that's the problem.
Unless you're doing the look.

1518
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:48,150
We live in a world that's so broad and 
comprehensive that unless you're doing 

1519
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:48,510
the actual research herself and not just
doing it,

1520
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:52,300
but doing it over a long period of time 
and very meticulous,

1521
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:57,360
most likely you don't know the actual 
numbers unless there's very few things 

1522
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,321
that I could talk about with utmost 
certainty that aren't involved directly 

1523
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:01,870
in my own life.
And when you deal with numbers,

1524
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:05,920
like numbers of imported guns,
export had guns,

1525
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,350
people dying in a place that you've 
never even visited.

1526
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,680
Boy,
you were relying on a lot of people's 

1527
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:13,680
data.
Yeah,

1528
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:13,680
yeah.
Yeah.

1529
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,970
And one thing that really is depressing 
is the degree to which people are.

1530
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:21,980
So this conversation is so politicized 
that you just even signed the climate 

1531
01:16:23,091 --> 01:16:28,091
change conversation.
The fact that there are people who are 

1532
01:16:28,091 --> 01:16:32,320
too,
you can always find someone with a phd 

1533
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:32,690
to sit up there and say,
you know,

1534
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,900
I don't think cigarettes caused cancer.
Right?

1535
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:37,340
I mean,
you can find those people.

1536
01:16:37,341 --> 01:16:42,341
You can find the people who are,
who are engineers who say that nine 

1537
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:43,810
slash 11 had to be an inside job because
you know,

1538
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,170
the melting point of steel,
blah,

1539
01:16:45,171 --> 01:16:45,680
blah,
blah,

1540
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,640
and you can find on all these issues 
you,

1541
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:53,641
you get incredibly politicized science 
and it's so,

1542
01:16:54,591 --> 01:16:58,880
but if certain things don't pass the 
smell test and 2 million to me,

1543
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,060
2 million people doesn't pass the smell 
test.

1544
01:17:02,061 --> 01:17:05,660
Certainly if you're going to say that we
killed those 2 million people that we,

1545
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:06,640
we,
you know,

1546
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:11,670
did we,
we did double the level of a Rwandan 

1547
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:11,930
genocide intentionally.

1548
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:16,930
That was what we did.
That just seems completely 

1549
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:21,710
masochistically hallucinatory to me.
I see your point.

1550
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,150
Um,
I don't know who's right,

1551
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:28,630
but I see your point now.
Was there anything else that she said 

1552
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:29,340
that you needed to dispute?
Um,

1553
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,200
I don't think so.
I mean,

1554
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:35,320
the thing I can say just categorically 
is that what she said about my concern 

1555
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,430
about intention is,
is just not true.

1556
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:42,450
It is.
If you intentions matter because they 

1557
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,861
are the best predictor as to what the,
what the person is likely to do in the 

1558
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:50,171
future.
If you know someone is killing people 

1559
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:52,841
because he intends that he wants that,
he wants to cause grief and suffering 

1560
01:17:52,841 --> 01:17:56,510
and death will then you know this is a 
person you have to jail or kill and this

1561
01:17:56,511 --> 01:18:01,511
is not a good actor.
If someone does it because they.

1562
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:07,510
They did it by accident or they didn't 
foresee the consequences of their 

1563
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,390
actions or they were trying to get the 
bad guy and they they,

1564
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,010
they produce collateral damage.

1565
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:13,640
It's a very different scenario and the 
at the body count may be the same.

1566
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:18,641
And so the thing I faulted Chomsky for 
in the past is that he seems to talk 

1567
01:18:18,641 --> 01:18:23,261
about situations where all you need to 
concern yourself as with his body count.

1568
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:29,711
So that.
The example I dealt with in my first 

1569
01:18:29,711 --> 01:18:29,711
book,
the end of faith was a,

1570
01:18:29,711 --> 01:18:30,650
and this was in reaction to a short 
book.

1571
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:32,780
He did right after nine slash 11 called 
nine slash 11.

1572
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:38,320
He talked about the Clintons bombing of 
the shift of a pharmaceutical plant in 

1573
01:18:39,471 --> 01:18:44,471
Sudan,
in retaliation for the embassy bond 

1574
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:46,990
bombings.
Al Qaeda bombings in Kenya in the 

1575
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:51,101
nineties.
And he talked about this bombing of the 

1576
01:18:51,531 --> 01:18:54,980
pharmaceutical plant as a,
as a great atrocity,

1577
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,120
seemingly equivalent to the atrocity of 
nine slash 11 or worse,

1578
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,780
um,
because of the,

1579
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:07,860
of the consequences for Sudan of having 
their for half the supply of 

1580
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:07,970
pharmaceuticals destroy,
they couldn't,

1581
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:13,170
you know,
people would die from preventable 

1582
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:13,170
illness as a result of this.

1583
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:13,760
Well,
what an incredible atrocity except,

1584
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,480
you know,
the representation of our government was

1585
01:19:17,481 --> 01:19:22,481
not.
And I think any rational thinking on 

1586
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:25,121
this topic,
which would suggest that our intention 

1587
01:19:25,121 --> 01:19:25,121
was not to destroy a pharmaceutical 
plant.

1588
01:19:25,121 --> 01:19:29,651
We claim to be bombing what we thought 
was a chemical weapons factory were run 

1589
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:34,811
by al Qaeda and we wanted to degrade 
that capacity of theirs after they hit 

1590
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:39,020
just bombed to embassies in east Africa.
So,

1591
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,660
um,
let's just say that's true,

1592
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,940
but who knows what our actual intentions
were.

1593
01:19:43,941 --> 01:19:48,941
But if,
if our intention was to bomb a chemical 

1594
01:19:48,941 --> 01:19:51,431
weapons plant that we didn't know was a 
pharmaceutical plant and we bombed a 

1595
01:19:52,281 --> 01:19:54,950
pharmaceutical plant that was being used
for peaceful purposes.

1596
01:19:54,951 --> 01:19:59,951
And as a result,
tens of thousands of people didn't get 

1597
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:02,621
their medicine and died.
That is not an equivalent atrocity to 

1598
01:20:02,621 --> 01:20:04,640
intentionally killing tens of thousands 
of people.

1599
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,350
Right?
It's a,

1600
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,290
it's,
it's an instance of bad luck.

1601
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:12,320
You were trying to get the bad guys.
We bombed it in the middle of the night 

1602
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,621
as far as I know,
Clinton didn't even think anyone would 

1603
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:15,621
be there.
Right.

1604
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:16,710
So it's possible that we weren't trying 
to kill anyone per se.

1605
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,400
We were just trying to bomb a chemical 
weapons plant.

1606
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:26,060
If you accept that to be true,
then the fact that tens of thousands of 

1607
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,280
people died as a result doesn't have the
same ethical significance.

1608
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:33,840
It is much more like you and I are just 
trying to get home at 55 miles an hour,

1609
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:37,860
but we're participating in a system 
that's going to kill 30,000

1610
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:40,110
people this year based on our speed 
limits.

1611
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,480
We're not intending to kill any of those
people.

1612
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,260
Right?
It's just.

1613
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,050
And,
but perhaps we should have foreseen.

1614
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,390
So it was bad data was bad data.
Well,

1615
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:49,130
no,
I mean that's,

1616
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,150
that's what our government said about 
his actions.

1617
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:54,180
Now let's say,
let's say that's not true.

1618
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:56,070
Let's say,
um,

1619
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:01,610
let's say it was a pharmacy,
let's say we knew it was a 

1620
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:03,591
pharmaceutical medical plans,
but we also thought it was a chemical 

1621
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:06,831
weapons plant and we bombed it really 
knowing what the bat,

1622
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:11,860
you know,
we thought we were going to get the 

1623
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,071
chemical weapons facility,
but we also knew we were going to 

1624
01:21:13,071 --> 01:21:16,790
destroy all of their,
their pharmaceutical infrastructure and 

1625
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:19,620
that would have cascading bad effects 
that all things considered.

1626
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:21,070
We didn't care that much about.
Right.

1627
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:26,080
Let's say,
let's say it was that the place on this 

1628
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:26,080
continuum of,
you know,

1629
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,200
moral callousness,
well that's still different than trying 

1630
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,340
to kill 10,000
people by taking away their medicine.

1631
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:32,760
Right?
It's,

1632
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:33,740
it's,
um,

1633
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,100
it's May,
may,

1634
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:36,270
May.
In My,

1635
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:41,460
in my view,
it may not be so different and it's 

1636
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:41,460
something that we would be culpable for.

1637
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:45,870
But I think you have to what Matt,
the reason why intentions matter is 

1638
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:50,361
because they are,
they're the clear expression of what we 

1639
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,460
are committed the ends to which we're 
committed.

1640
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:55,640
If the kind of world we want to live in.
And so you have.

1641
01:21:55,810 --> 01:22:00,810
I mean,
this is what I did in that first book I 

1642
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:04,221
asked them,
this is a thought experiment I called 

1643
01:22:04,221 --> 01:22:04,221
the,
um,

1644
01:22:04,221 --> 01:22:04,910
the perfect weapon where I said,
well,

1645
01:22:04,911 --> 01:22:09,911
you know,
just imagine what a group would do if 

1646
01:22:09,911 --> 01:22:09,911
they had perfect weapons,
right?

1647
01:22:09,911 --> 01:22:11,280
Where they know there's no such thing as
collateral damage.

1648
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:14,070
They could just target everyone they 
wanted to target.

1649
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:15,830
They would never hit the,
you know,

1650
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,710
the sound been lawns mom who happened to
be standing too close to him.

1651
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:24,711
They just go,
they're just going to hit Osama bin 

1652
01:22:24,711 --> 01:22:24,711
Ladin.
Um,

1653
01:22:24,711 --> 01:22:26,850
so what would any one group do with the 
perfect weapon?

1654
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,820
What would Bibi Netanyahu do with 
perfect weapons?

1655
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:32,250
What would Hitler have done with perfect
weapons?

1656
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,840
What would Bill Clinton do with perfect 
weapons?

1657
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:40,100
People like Chomsky and Abby Martin talk
about the Clintons and the bushes and 

1658
01:22:41,281 --> 01:22:43,950
the net and Yahoos and the Dick Cheney's
of the world.

1659
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,140
And I'm not necessarily equating all of 
those people,

1660
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:51,141
but they're all,
they're all sort of in a certain area 

1661
01:22:51,141 --> 01:22:51,141
for me.
I'm,

1662
01:22:51,141 --> 01:22:56,120
uh,
as though they would act with the 

1663
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:59,841
perfect weapon exactly the way Hitler or
Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein would 

1664
01:23:01,261 --> 01:23:04,320
act with the perfect weapon that we have
a level of malevolence,

1665
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:09,950
a level of commitment that makes you so 
much of what she was saying essentially 

1666
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:14,071
that kind of the,
the intentions of our government are to 

1667
01:23:14,071 --> 01:23:18,181
go around the world killing Brown 
skinned people and that was a pick a 

1668
01:23:18,181 --> 01:23:21,721
phrase she used and that,
and the spirit in which he talked about 

1669
01:23:21,721 --> 01:23:26,040
our culpability on the world stage is 
very much in the sense that we have 

1670
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:30,571
intentionally murdered millions of brown
skin people because we don't care about 

1671
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:31,030
them.

1672
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:33,460
And maybe it's part of the reason why 
we,

1673
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,440
we want them dead.
Right?

1674
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:38,470
Um,
and that's,

1675
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,450
I do not believe that's the situation 
we're in.

1676
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:45,451
I believe.
I certainly unbelief that someone like 

1677
01:23:45,451 --> 01:23:47,170
President Obama wants to create massive 
collateral damage.

1678
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:52,230
And if you gave him the perfect weapon,
I'm reasonably sure he would target the 

1679
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:52,900
bad guys.
People who,

1680
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:58,210
if you and I could vote on whether these
people should go down 90,

1681
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,940
we would have a 90 percent convergence 
with him.

1682
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:06,120
Right.
We wouldn't find ourselves in the 

1683
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:06,120
presence of a,
of a psychopath who just was so amped up

1684
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,100
on his power to kill that he would be 
killing,

1685
01:24:09,101 --> 01:24:11,170
you know,
and frank.

1686
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,560
Right.
Whereas there are people who really did 

1687
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:16,680
kill and frank because they intended to 
kill hand,

1688
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,400
frank and everyone like her.
Right.

1689
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:22,180
There's a difference.
Is there any culpability?

1690
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,230
Is there any.

1691
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:28,440
Do you put any blame on the United 
States government and our foreign policy

1692
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:34,711
and our decisions as far as the 
domination of global natural resources,

1693
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:40,110
whatever we've done overseas is,
is that in any way responsible for the 

1694
01:24:41,711 --> 01:24:44,350
hatred that these people have for 
America in the first place?

1695
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:45,910
Yeah.
Well,

1696
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:48,790
yeah,
and beyond the hatred,

1697
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:53,930
uh,
responsible for our alliances with 

1698
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:56,650
people who commit outright human rights 
by Saudi Arabia.

1699
01:24:56,651 --> 01:25:00,730
Yeah.
So the fact that we can't just break all

1700
01:25:00,731 --> 01:25:05,731
ties with Saudi Arabia,
the fact that we can't twist their arm 

1701
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:10,170
and get them to behave like civilized,
a civilized culture,

1702
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,150
a culture on the world stage at this 
point.

1703
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,260
So they're,
they're jailing and,

1704
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:20,020
and caning bloggers.
This is one,

1705
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:24,730
a atheist blogger.
I'm a Rafe Badawi.

1706
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:27,310
I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing his 
name.

1707
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,250
Um,
you know,

1708
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,420
it's a,
it's an absolute scandal.

1709
01:25:31,421 --> 01:25:36,421
The fact that we can't apply more 
pressure to them and that isn't as far 

1710
01:25:36,421 --> 01:25:40,471
as I can tell,
entirely explained by our dependence on 

1711
01:25:40,471 --> 01:25:44,011
oil and our unwillingness we have the 
technology to break this dependence on 

1712
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:44,011
oil.

1713
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:48,570
The fact that we have such entrenched 
financial interests that's keeping us 

1714
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:50,800
tied to oil.
Um,

1715
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:55,890
and that,
that the whole military industrial 

1716
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:57,260
complex is tuned to safeguard those 
interests for,

1717
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,130
for us in the world that have those 
interests have been,

1718
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:02,110
they've been monetized,
they been controlled,

1719
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:07,150
well monopolize,
roll back the clock 50 years there I'm 

1720
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:10,910
sure was not an alternative to being 
dependent on oil.

1721
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:11,840
Right.
There's a certain point.

1722
01:26:11,841 --> 01:26:16,841
So we're totally dependent on oil.
Civilization just needs petrochemicals 

1723
01:26:16,841 --> 01:26:20,891
to survive.
And they all happen to be buried in the 

1724
01:26:20,891 --> 01:26:20,891
ground,
in inconveniently,

1725
01:26:20,891 --> 01:26:23,210
under the palaces of these religious 
maniacs,

1726
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,820
the that may have been the situation 
then.

1727
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:33,850
So how culpable we are are we for 
securing our interests and not just we 

1728
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:34,520
the US,
but you know,

1729
01:26:34,521 --> 01:26:39,521
the west at that point by,
by entering a relationship with the 

1730
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:43,700
house of sowed.
That's one question that may have been a

1731
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:48,701
marriage of necessity and there have 
been marriages of necessity with 

1732
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:48,701
tyrants,
I think in the past,

1733
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:53,441
but now the fact that we can't sprint to
the finish line and get off of oil,

1734
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:55,460
right?

1735
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:00,460
We know this is a dwindling resource,
we know is a disaster for climate 

1736
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:03,310
change.
We know that there would be a,

1737
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:04,420
uh,
the,

1738
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:09,710
the financial and technological 
renaissance that's waiting if we all 

1739
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,500
just grab Elon Musk's coattails and,
and,

1740
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:16,790
and go towards sustainable energy.
Um,

1741
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:18,770
all of this,
you know,

1742
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,280
our interests and what we're funding 
both sides of the war on terror.

1743
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:27,281
It makes absolutely no sense.
So we should just make a full court 

1744
01:27:27,281 --> 01:27:28,340
press in the direction of 
sustainability,

1745
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:32,510
energy security,
and getting ourselves into a position to

1746
01:27:32,511 --> 01:27:37,511
say to the people like the Saudis,
you treat your bloggers better or we're 

1747
01:27:37,511 --> 01:27:38,420
going to bankrupt you,
right?

1748
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:38,840
I mean,
it's just,

1749
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,880
you all,
all their wealth is coming down of the 

1750
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:43,880
ground,
right?

1751
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,710
So the moment we don't need this wealth 
or need to defend it,

1752
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:49,250
what would be in a much better position 
to demand that they,

1753
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,760
that people treat women better 
throughout the world and they treat,

1754
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:53,540
you know,
they,

1755
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:55,400
they honor free speech,
etc.

1756
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:59,150
So I think it's a scandal that we,
we are not,

1757
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,470
uh,
doing that and I think we asked,

1758
01:28:02,471 --> 01:28:05,430
we are culpable for doing that,
but given the,

1759
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:10,600
given what would happen to us in the 
near term if we lost access to oil.

1760
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:14,720
And again,
I'm not juSt talking about us,

1761
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:17,120
I'm talking about europe and just the 
whole world.

1762
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:22,690
it's a,
it's been a very difficult situation to 

1763
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:22,970
be in and it's understandable that we 
have gotten into this situation,

1764
01:28:22,971 --> 01:28:25,180
but I don't find it understandable now 
that we,

1765
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:26,460
we aren't,
um,

1766
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,840
you know,
sprinting away for it.

1767
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:29,360
So fucking

1768
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:34,420
define your point of view.
Your point of view is more of a 

1769
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,460
pragmatic take on what the world is 
currently at this stage.

1770
01:28:36,461 --> 01:28:41,461
It's not your,
you're not taking away the 

1771
01:28:41,461 --> 01:28:41,461
responsibility of the United States 
government.

1772
01:28:41,461 --> 01:28:43,480
You're not saying that they haven't made
horrific decisions.

1773
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:48,630
You're not saying that they haven't been
manipulated by these gigantic 

1774
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:52,740
corporations that are profiting off of 
the war that we're currently involved 

1775
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:56,791
in,
that you were just saying that if you 

1776
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:58,981
want to look at the actual reality of 
the good guys and the bad guys and 

1777
01:28:58,981 --> 01:28:59,590
where,
where the world is fucked right now.

1778
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,160
There are certain things that have to be
done and there are certain

1779
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,230
people that have to be taken out.
If you do not,

1780
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:05,820
you put everyone else at risk.
Is that,

1781
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,620
is that a good?
That's fair.

1782
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:12,880
Well,
I guess I would only tweak it add that 

1783
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:18,100
and I.
This is the ipad saying this for 10 

1784
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,100
years,
at least,

1785
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,940
are now closer to 15 years and It just 
never gets heard.

1786
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:26,080
I can grant someone like chomsky,
you know,

1787
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,890
80,
90 percent of his thesis.

1788
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:29,460
Right.
So yeah,

1789
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:35,050
I think he's,
he pushes forward into kind of a 

1790
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:36,510
masochistic voodoo a little bit.
But,

1791
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,080
but we have done horrific things 
historically.

1792
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:40,700
Right.
And,

1793
01:29:40,701 --> 01:29:42,860
and the question is just how far you 
want to roll you.

1794
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:45,660
You'll walk back in your,
in your time machine.

1795
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:47,400
But you know,
starting with,

1796
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:49,500
you know,
our treatment of the native americans on

1797
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:51,750
up and it depends on who,
who the we is.

1798
01:29:51,751 --> 01:29:53,340
But we be in the United States,
right?

1799
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,230
So we get,
we get here,

1800
01:29:55,470 --> 01:30:00,470
we start behaving badly and we behave 
badly for a very long while and we have 

1801
01:30:00,781 --> 01:30:05,781
done terrible things.
And yet it is also true that we have 

1802
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:07,770
enemies we haven't made.
We have people.

1803
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:12,771
There are people who have had the 
benefit of everything the west has to 

1804
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:14,610
offer,
who are waking up today deciding to join

1805
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:19,640
isis for reasons that have nothing to do
with us foreign policy or if they do 

1806
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,550
have something to do with us foreign 
policy.

1807
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:26,060
It's based on a theological grievance.
It's not based on any real political 

1808
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:30,201
concern for the lives of the 
palestinians is based on you've got 

1809
01:30:30,201 --> 01:30:32,390
infidels too close to muslim holy sites.
Um,

1810
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:35,450
and you have the problem.
The,

1811
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:40,530
the intellectual and moral problem I've 
spent more time focused on is the 

1812
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,660
problem of someone like jihadi john,
right?

1813
01:30:42,661 --> 01:30:45,090
The guy who has got a degree in computer
science,

1814
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,330
right?

1815
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:48,900
He comes from a middle upper,
middle class background in the uk.

1816
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:52,480
He's got all the opportunity anyone 
could want that.

1817
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:57,481
There are at least 3 billion people,
probably something like 5 billion 

1818
01:30:57,481 --> 01:30:58,830
people,
excuse me,

1819
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:04,260
who would,
who would trade places with him to be in

1820
01:31:04,261 --> 01:31:06,690
a position of such opportunity in this 
world.

1821
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:12,230
And yet,
the opportunity he wants to take is to 

1822
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:15,330
move to Iraq or Syria and,
you know,

1823
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:17,970
cut the heads off of journalists and aid
workers,

1824
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,450
journalists and aid workers.
They're not know navy seals.

1825
01:31:21,451 --> 01:31:26,220
They captured.
They want to kill the aid workers.

1826
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,660
It's not an accident,
it's not,

1827
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:32,670
it's not something that,
it's not like a perversion of their 

1828
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:32,670
impulse is not like,
oh,

1829
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:34,620
I would really wish this guy wasn't an 
aid worker or a journalist,

1830
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:36,720
you know,
but when he's the only guy we have no,

1831
01:31:36,721 --> 01:31:41,721
this is,
this is their commitments or that 

1832
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:41,721
horrible.

1833
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:41,750
Right?
And,

1834
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:43,470
and,
um,

1835
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:49,190
you have to explain how,
and this is something that someone like 

1836
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:51,660
abby martin and someone like noam 
chomsky is the phenomenon.

1837
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:56,661
they really don't explain how is it that
someone with all the opportunity who's 

1838
01:31:56,661 --> 01:32:00,410
never been victimized by anyone,
how is it that he is committed to the 

1839
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:05,221
most of horns and profligate misuse of 
human life where he's just his risk 

1840
01:32:06,181 --> 01:32:08,500
ready to burn up the world,
right?

1841
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:14,280
And now how do you get tens of thousands
of people like this coming from a first 

1842
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,210
world societies and map.
And so then,

1843
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:18,040
so given that,
given that phenomenon,

1844
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:23,070
then what explains the commitments of 
the people who don't have all those 

1845
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:28,831
opportunities right there,
the people who are born in these 

1846
01:32:28,831 --> 01:32:28,831
societies are shell shocked and had been
mistreated at who,

1847
01:32:28,831 --> 01:32:33,600
who are,
who have understandable grievances 

1848
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:33,600
against us,
right?

1849
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:33,880
They are part of the collateral damage.

1850
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,860
We've been bombing over there after.
All right?

1851
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:38,890
So it's no mystery that they would hate 
the west,

1852
01:32:38,891 --> 01:32:39,760
right?
Some of them.

1853
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,650
I meAn,
some of them still love the west,

1854
01:32:41,651 --> 01:32:42,850
some of them still are trying to get 
out.

1855
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:47,851
Some of that I hear from,
I fear I hear from atheist in these 

1856
01:32:47,851 --> 01:32:48,820
countries who don't hate the west.
I mean they don't follow.

1857
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:51,640
They don't follow abby martin's line on 
this.

1858
01:32:51,641 --> 01:32:52,270
They don't,
they don't.

1859
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,150
They understand why we were bombing in 
their neighborhoods.

1860
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:56,260
Right?
But,

1861
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,920
um,
the fact is this is really like a 

1862
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,831
science experiment there,
prIstine cases of people who have no 

1863
01:33:04,831 --> 01:33:08,371
rational grievance,
who devote their lives to waging jihad 

1864
01:33:08,371 --> 01:33:10,090
and they're not mentally ill and they're
not.

1865
01:33:10,091 --> 01:33:11,200
And that's,
that's the,

1866
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:13,460
that's the problem that I,
that,

1867
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:18,770
that problem is scaling thing that I 
worry about is that as a meme that is 

1868
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:22,231
spreadable you don't have to ever meet 
anyone affiliated with a terrorist 

1869
01:33:22,231 --> 01:33:22,840
organization to get this idea into your 
head.

1870
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,540
And,
and so that's,

1871
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:28,180
that's the piece I have focused on.
Um,

1872
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:31,210
and it's not that I've denied the 
reality of the other pieces.

1873
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:35,360
Is this related in any way to just a 
natural instinct that's a certain amount

1874
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:40,361
of people have to be contrarians.
I mean there's certain amount of people 

1875
01:33:40,361 --> 01:33:44,261
that when they,
when they find any sort of large group 

1876
01:33:44,261 --> 01:33:44,261
that's in power,
they want to oppose them.

1877
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:46,850
If they find a band that's popular,
they want to hate it.

1878
01:33:46,851 --> 01:33:49,190
If they find a political party that's in
control,

1879
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:54,370
they want to oppose it.
There's a certain amount of people that 

1880
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:57,371
are just natural contrarians.
When they find a group that is 

1881
01:33:57,371 --> 01:34:00,311
absolutely committed and completely 
involved in an ideology to the point 

1882
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:07,751
where they're rabid about it,
it becomes attractive to them and they 

1883
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:10,601
want to join that resistance to fight 
against the death star that is the 

1884
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:14,591
United States.
I'm not religious by any stretch of the 

1885
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:18,431
imagination,
but what I am is curious and one of the 

1886
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:22,331
things that I like to do is I like to 
watch a really pious or really obsessed 

1887
01:34:24,561 --> 01:34:25,520
religious people.

1888
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:30,550
I love to watch videos of them because I
find it fascinating and there's a 

1889
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:33,320
certain amount of.
When I see the islamic scholars that are

1890
01:34:33,321 --> 01:34:37,880
talking in absolutes,
absolute confidence about their beliefs,

1891
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:41,010
there's a certaIn amount of that that I 
personally find attractive.

1892
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:45,020
I don't want to join isis.
I don't want to become a muslim,

1893
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:50,230
but when I see someone almost like what 
we're talking about with conor mcgrEgor 

1894
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,200
earlier where he just fucking believes,
man.

1895
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:54,410
When someone believes I was watching 
this guy.

1896
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,960
I forget his name,
but he's a guy from.

1897
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
He lives in the uk and he's this rabid 
islamic scholar that he.

1898
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:07,330
All of his tweets are on.
How islam is superior and it doesn't 

1899
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:11,351
have to be adjusted like the laws of 
modern society and secular wisdom is 

1900
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:14,390
inferior to the islamic wisdom and blah,
blah,

1901
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:17,960
blah.
I watched this guy do this youtube video

1902
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:23,350
where he's describing how islamic 
culture is superior to western culture 

1903
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:27,200
in terms of the way they manage money 
and he made a lot of fucking good points

1904
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:29,780
and made a lot of good points about 
wealth and about,

1905
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:34,810
uh,
about building economies and about how 

1906
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:34,810
you,
you know,

1907
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,800
you take a company that's only worth 
$100,000,

1908
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:39,290
but you could sell it for a million 
dollars or you know,

1909
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,360
trade it,
you know,

1910
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:44,630
you have stocks and this is invisible 
wealth and islam doesn't allow invisible

1911
01:35:44,631 --> 01:35:49,631
wealth because that's how society is get
crushed and that's how we're other 

1912
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:50,570
economies crumble.

1913
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:55,990
And I'm watching this guy with his moral
certainty and his extreme confidence in 

1914
01:35:58,851 --> 01:36:01,850
what he's saying absolute.
And it becomes compelling.

1915
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,950
And I'm not joining.
I'm not,

1916
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:08,951
I'm not saying that he got me,
but I'm saying that I'm just absolutely 

1917
01:36:08,951 --> 01:36:12,341
admitting there's a per a certain aspect
of human nature that gets compelled to 

1918
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:12,341
join groups.
Oops.

1919
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:13,000
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1920
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:14,550
Well,
there's something,

1921
01:36:14,650 --> 01:36:17,580
there's that component of it which,
which I understand,

1922
01:36:17,581 --> 01:36:22,581
but there's also just the,
the religious ecstasy component,

1923
01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:25,380
the aesthetics,
the emotional component of it,

1924
01:36:25,381 --> 01:36:29,520
which I really understand and I'm 
susceptible to so far.

1925
01:36:29,521 --> 01:36:34,521
I have a blog post leaves called islam 
and the misuses of ecstasy where it's 

1926
01:36:35,971 --> 01:36:40,971
actually the first blog posts I ever 
wrote where I realized I could not 

1927
01:36:40,971 --> 01:36:44,241
possibly have written this in book form 
or in a newspaper because it relied on 

1928
01:36:44,821 --> 01:36:49,821
embedded video.
And the only way to have done this with 

1929
01:36:49,821 --> 01:36:50,010
was with embedded video.
And um,

1930
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,160
I wrote this,
I think in,

1931
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,660
you know,
once again over protest the,

1932
01:36:55,020 --> 01:37:00,020
something was said about me by glenn 
greenwald or somebody to show it.

1933
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:05,510
Yeah.
The charge had been that I totally lack 

1934
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,510
empathy,
right?

1935
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,510
Like,
I'm not,

1936
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:06,840
I don't even know what it's like to be,
you know,

1937
01:37:06,841 --> 01:37:08,580
what these people are getting out of 
their religion.

1938
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:13,580
Right.
I've just demonized a whole people I 

1939
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:15,621
don't understand religion and so I wrote
this blog post to trying to indicate how

1940
01:37:16,261 --> 01:37:18,840
far from the truth that was.
So I wrote.

1941
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,410
So I,
I put the example of the call to prayer,

1942
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:24,600
right?
Which I think,

1943
01:37:24,601 --> 01:37:26,400
I mean there,
there are some that sound kind of ratty,

1944
01:37:26,401 --> 01:37:31,401
but a nice call to prayer I think is one
of the most beautiful sounding things 

1945
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:33,180
humanity has ever produced,
right?

1946
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:33,410
I mean,
I,

1947
01:37:33,411 --> 01:37:34,560
that,
that hits me,

1948
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:36,060
that gets into my bones,
right?

1949
01:37:36,061 --> 01:37:41,061
I don't,
I don't have to imagine what a devout 

1950
01:37:41,061 --> 01:37:43,161
muslim,
his feeling when he hears the call to 

1951
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:43,161
prayer.
I think it's absolutely beautiful.

1952
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:45,480
Right?
And without even knowing the length.

1953
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:46,380
Exactly.
right.

1954
01:37:46,381 --> 01:37:49,050
And I'm not without ever having been a 
muslim or believe in any,

1955
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:54,130
you know,
if that sound and again to your 

1956
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:57,600
listeners can just read that blog post,
I only dimly remember what I wrote,

1957
01:37:57,601 --> 01:38:02,601
but if that's,
if that ritual was purposed as to 

1958
01:38:02,601 --> 01:38:04,410
towards some other end,
right?

1959
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:07,530
If that ritual just was signifying,
you know,

1960
01:38:07,531 --> 01:38:12,531
let's all get up in the morning and 
consider how profound human 

1961
01:38:12,531 --> 01:38:14,910
consciousness is and consider our 
togetherness on this,

1962
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:19,940
you know,
rock spinning through empty space and 

1963
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:23,220
realized that we just have this common 
project to make the world beautiful.

1964
01:38:23,221 --> 01:38:25,050
Right?
If that was what that meant,

1965
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,480
right?
I would just want a minaret,

1966
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,350
you know,
right next to my house in the,

1967
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,210
you know,
I mean I would just,

1968
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:32,420
I would,
I would be totally on board with,

1969
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:33,390
with,
with the,

1970
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,730
the experience of,
of,

1971
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:39,570
of participating in that.
so I'm totally empathetic there.

1972
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,600
And I.
So I went through many other instances 

1973
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:45,390
of this where something I'm seeing in 
the muslim world,

1974
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:50,990
I,
I really grok how beautIful and 

1975
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:51,780
meaningful and captivating this is for 
people.

1976
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:55,560
But then at the end I put in a,
a,

1977
01:38:55,930 --> 01:39:00,930
um,
a quranic recitation and sermon by a.

1978
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,970
Forgot his name now,
but some shake who's got,

1979
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,040
you know,
like 10 times the number of twitter 

1980
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:08,040
followers you have,
right?

1981
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:08,040
I mean,
so he's like,

1982
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:11,690
he's not a fringe figure.
He's a muslim rockstar and you know,

1983
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:17,670
you see the translation of what he,
he's given this tear filled recitation 

1984
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:18,300
of the koran,
which again is beautiful,

1985
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:18,990
right?
He's a great,

1986
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:24,200
he's a great singer and I'm at the end.
It's a packed house in wherever it was,

1987
01:39:25,921 --> 01:39:27,240
Saudi Arabia,
Yemen,

1988
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:32,480
and um,
but what is being said there is so 

1989
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:38,300
ethically ugly right center essentially 
celebrating that the tortures of hell,

1990
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,950
right?
And just,

1991
01:39:39,951 --> 01:39:42,120
just expressing a certainty that,
that,

1992
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:44,580
that infidels are going to go to hell 
and how,

1993
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,870
you know,
this is a,

1994
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,920
you have to organize your life around 
this question,

1995
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:54,090
but just how to,
how to escape the torments of hell.

1996
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:56,630
And the only way to do it has to be a 
true believer in,

1997
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:59,520
in the koran and mohammed,
etc.

1998
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:04,110
And this is at the center of the,
of the,

1999
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:07,350
the mandola of their ethical concern.

2000
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:12,370
There's nothing matters but nothing,
nothing in this life matters but 

2001
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:16,191
avoiding hell fire.
And so there's kind of a ghastly 

2002
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:21,210
perversion of this impulse that I think 
many of us feel.

2003
01:40:21,211 --> 01:40:24,510
I certainly feel it to transcend 
yourself,

2004
01:40:24,511 --> 01:40:27,870
to experience bliss and ecstasy and 
compassion.

2005
01:40:27,871 --> 01:40:31,150
And um,
and you know,

2006
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:32,070
it's,
it is very much,

2007
01:40:32,071 --> 01:40:32,600
it's,
it's,

2008
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,830
it's very much like burning man for 
people.

2009
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:35,530
I mean it's like if,
if,

2010
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,760
imagine at burning man,
whereas just as ecstatic as it was 

2011
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,410
attracting all the smart people that it 
attracts but strewn throughout,

2012
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:51,171
it was a message of just true 
divisiveness like everyone else who's 

2013
01:40:51,721 --> 01:40:56,721
not here is going to be tortured for 
eternity and they deserve it and we 

2014
01:40:56,721 --> 01:41:01,561
shouldn't be their friends and we should
fuck them over any way we can when we 

2015
01:41:01,561 --> 01:41:05,101
get out of this place.
And if god had wanted to enlighten them,

2016
01:41:05,261 --> 01:41:06,730
he would have,
but he hasn't.

2017
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:10,530
So we're the only ones here and,
and it just kind of an a,

2018
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:15,580
a durable message of us and them 
thinking that just cannot be dissolved.

2019
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:20,670
Right?
That's what's going on in the muslim 

2020
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:20,670
world.
And,

2021
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:23,290
and that's a huge problem because it 
does,

2022
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:26,720
it's pulling all the strings of,
you know,

2023
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:28,510
I mean,
it's not just islam.

2024
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:30,610
Obviously christianity has a version of 
this and,

2025
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:33,100
and all religions and principle have a 
version of this,

2026
01:41:33,101 --> 01:41:38,101
but there are differences there.
There is no version of jihad that know 

2027
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:44,580
there's no buddhist jihad.
It's not to say that buddhist can't do 

2028
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:47,461
terrible things and it's not to say you 
can't find buddhist reasons for doing 

2029
01:41:47,461 --> 01:41:48,940
terrible things,
but their jihad,

2030
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:52,330
jihad martyrdom,
paradise.

2031
01:41:52,331 --> 01:41:52,930
TheSe,
this,

2032
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:56,590
this is the jewel,
you know,

2033
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:02,190
horrible jewel that,
that so many millions of people are 

2034
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:03,010
contemplating in,
in an islamic context.

2035
01:42:03,011 --> 01:42:08,011
And that's,
that's what I'm worried about and I'm 

2036
01:42:08,011 --> 01:42:10,561
not insensitive to the,
to the experience people are having is 

2037
01:42:10,561 --> 01:42:13,570
this version of islam,
recent in human history.

2038
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:16,300
There's this extreme radical version of 
this.

2039
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:19,660
There are some things you can say that 
have,

2040
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:24,690
you know,
with wahhabism and salafi style islam 

2041
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:30,151
generally that have been politicized and
tuned up in a negative way in the last 

2042
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:37,140
century that you can say that,
but the reality is that jihad is as old 

2043
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:43,411
as islam and islam spread by jihad and 
it isn't the original version of jihad 

2044
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,620
or on your own vices.
Oh no,

2045
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:47,350
that's just.
No,

2046
01:42:47,351 --> 01:42:52,351
I mean there is that component to it.
There is a energy hot and an outer 

2047
01:42:52,351 --> 01:42:55,630
jihad,
but there was always an outer jihad and 

2048
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:55,810
that's how muhammad spread the faith and
mohammed.

2049
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,850
I mean,
so to answer your question very simply,

2050
01:42:57,851 --> 01:43:02,851
as I did somewhere,
I just said there's absolutely nothing 

2051
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:06,400
isis is doing.
The islamic state is doing that.

2052
01:43:06,401 --> 01:43:11,401
Mohammed didn't do right.
I think I said good luck finding 

2053
01:43:11,401 --> 01:43:14,020
something significant that some 
difference between.

2054
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:16,450
I mean taking sex slaves,
right?

2055
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:20,380
Muhammad took sex slaves and gave sex 
slaves to his.

2056
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,780
His generals.
It was totally kosher.

2057
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:25,660
Kosher thing to do.
If You're going to follow the example of

2058
01:43:25,661 --> 01:43:26,800
stefan that kosher.
Yeah.

2059
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,030
Nobody.
Hello?

2060
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:33,920
I mean if you're going,
if you're going to follow muhammad's 

2061
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:33,920
example,
which is a real,

2062
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,590
is perhaps the main lens through what 
you have to look at this.

2063
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:43,100
There's the.
That's just what's in the koran and 

2064
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,871
there's what's in the huddle with the 
larger literature and there's the 

2065
01:43:45,871 --> 01:43:45,871
example of muhammad,
which is,

2066
01:43:45,871 --> 01:43:50,260
which is a tested two in both those 
literatures and in the early biographies

2067
01:43:50,261 --> 01:43:54,350
about him.
Mohammed was not like the buddha.

2068
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,200
He was not like jesus.
He was not like he was not.

2069
01:43:57,290 --> 01:44:00,770
He was,
he was a conquering warlord,

2070
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,930
who's succeeded,
right?

2071
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:08,110
And that is an example that is very 
different from the example of a guy who 

2072
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:11,681
got crucified or the example of a guy 
spent his wife meditating and then 

2073
01:44:11,681 --> 01:44:11,900
teaching,
right?

2074
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:16,900
If,
if the buddha had been lopping heads 

2075
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:16,900
off,
you know,

2076
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:20,320
add every sermon and advocating just 
talking endlessly about when to kill 

2077
01:44:22,401 --> 01:44:24,500
people and how many people to kill and 
you know,

2078
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:26,840
how many sex later,
how to treat your sex lives.

2079
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:32,380
If that was,
if that was just strewn throughout the 

2080
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:35,771
buddhist teaching,
I would expect buddhists to behave 

2081
01:44:35,771 --> 01:44:38,501
exactly the way we see members of isis 
and al qaeda and al shabaab and boko 

2082
01:44:38,501 --> 01:44:40,790
haram behave.
How to treat your sex slaves.

2083
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,770
Sure.
How many.

2084
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:46,370
So yes,
how do you treat your sex lives?

2085
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:50,360
Why don't you taking,
taking sex?

2086
01:44:50,430 --> 01:44:52,960
I mean taking sex slaves,
taking immediate.

2087
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:57,970
So you can.
It's not adultery if you're having sex 

2088
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:57,970
with sex slaves,
it's adultery.

2089
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:58,520
If you're,
if you're having sex with someone,

2090
01:44:58,521 --> 01:44:59,760
you care about other women,
right?

2091
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,110
Or other muslim women,
but you're convenient.

2092
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:04,330
Um,
no,

2093
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,380
you can slavery.

2094
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:11,410
I mean this,
this is the horror of of abrahamic 

2095
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:11,410
religion.
Generally.

2096
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,790
These are.
ThIs is why we know these are books were

2097
01:45:13,791 --> 01:45:18,791
not authored by a moral genius.
The bible and the koran can't give you a

2098
01:45:20,271 --> 01:45:23,960
basis to resist slavery.
They did slavery,

2099
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:28,961
supported in both traditions,
so the fact that we have after centuries

2100
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:35,800
decided to more or less unanimously that
slavery is an abomination that proves 

2101
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:42,371
that there's more moral wisdom to be 
found outside of these books than 

2102
01:45:42,371 --> 01:45:47,321
inside.
At least on that point and I met and I 

2103
01:45:47,321 --> 01:45:47,930
would argue on virtually every other 
point of consequence.

2104
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:50,120
Now it's not that.
It's not to say they're not jams of,

2105
01:45:50,121 --> 01:45:55,121
of,
of moral wisdom and in some of these 

2106
01:45:55,121 --> 01:45:57,941
books,
but they're not best found in those 

2107
01:45:57,941 --> 01:45:59,930
books and there's so much else in there 
that is just that gives you the ethic of

2108
01:45:59,931 --> 01:46:01,580
the taliban and that's,
and that's.

2109
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:07,300
It's an inconvenient fact because it is.
This is what the fundamentalist 

2110
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:08,790
fundamentalist do that.
The islamists,

2111
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,000
the jihadists,
look at the books,

2112
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:17,530
know that the members of isis right now 
have the theology on their side.

2113
01:46:17,751 --> 01:46:19,580
It's not like they're ignoring the 
books.

2114
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:23,780
They're looking at the books very 
literally and they're saying,

2115
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:25,520
you know what,
in here,

2116
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:26,810
you know,
what are we,

2117
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:29,840
what are we doing that you don't find in
the books?

2118
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:33,440
Essentially it's like we were just.
This is just connecting the dots,

2119
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:38,460
you know,
that was one of the videos that you 

2120
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,101
would post it up on your blog that you 
and I discussed the guy that was 

2121
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:44,081
standing in front of all those people 
that was talking about stoning people 

2122
01:46:44,081 --> 01:46:47,381
for adultery or the treatment of 
homosexuals and how this is not radical 

2123
01:46:47,511 --> 01:46:50,220
islam.
This is just islam and that

2124
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:55,220
was shocking and that's one of those 
videos where you posted or you talk 

2125
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:56,990
about it and you get a million people 
that get upset at you over it.

2126
01:46:57,070 --> 01:47:02,070
Get a million people that call you 
islamophobic or what have you and get 

2127
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:05,130
upset about it and a lot of those are 
the same people.

2128
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:10,131
There was a weird thing that happened 
after charlie hebdo that really kind of 

2129
01:47:10,131 --> 01:47:13,701
freaked me oUt where there was a lot of 
liberals and progressives that we're 

2130
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:19,280
pointing to the callousness of the 
cartoons as almost a justification for 

2131
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:23,550
murdering a bunch of cartooniSts that,
you know,

2132
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:26,730
the punching down thing kept being 
discussed,

2133
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:31,740
this weird liberal obsession with the 
way humor is disseminated that in 

2134
01:47:32,641 --> 01:47:37,641
somehow or another it justified or at 
least a rationalize the fact that they 

2135
01:47:38,731 --> 01:47:42,770
could just gunned down cartoonists,
cartoonists,

2136
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:47,780
you're not talking about people that are
doing experiments on monkeys or people 

2137
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:52,491
that are a torturing animals mean you're
not talking about people that are 

2138
01:47:52,491 --> 01:47:56,121
imprisoning other human beings.
You're not talking about people that 

2139
01:47:56,121 --> 01:47:56,121
are,
you know,

2140
01:47:56,121 --> 01:47:58,830
even even stopping people from doing 
anything,

2141
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:01,530
just mocking them in cartoons

2142
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:06,780
or,
and in this case mocking also 

2143
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,650
christianity and the vatican and many of
the things that were interpreted,

2144
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:09,480
interpreted as racist,
warranty.

2145
01:48:09,481 --> 01:48:12,180
Even racist if You understood french or 
french politics.

2146
01:48:12,181 --> 01:48:13,520
So it's,
it's no,

2147
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:18,590
it's shocking.
And people like the people who missed 

2148
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:18,590
the,
the train on this,

2149
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:21,450
people like gary trudeau,
the doonesbury creator.

2150
01:48:21,451 --> 01:48:22,120
I mean,
he just,

2151
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:23,070
just,
uh,

2152
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:24,480
came out against,
um,

2153
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:29,400
uh,
charlene abdo and a bunch of writers who

2154
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,800
belonged to the pen America 
organization,

2155
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:34,620
which is the whole point of which is to 
defend free speech.

2156
01:48:34,621 --> 01:48:39,621
They just walked out of a gala event or 
declined to show up because penn had 

2157
01:48:40,321 --> 01:48:42,000
given charlene abdo the,
you know,

2158
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:44,880
the freedom of expression award this 
year as they should have.

2159
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:47,960
And some prominent people,
uh,

2160
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:51,220
pro laughter in protest.
And um,

2161
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:52,550
it's,
uh,

2162
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:54,390
no,
the faculty is that,

2163
01:48:54,391 --> 01:48:55,260
what,
what is that?

2164
01:48:55,330 --> 01:49:00,330
It's,
it's political correctness and fears 

2165
01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:03,321
about being perceived as a racist and 
this and this notion that you should,

2166
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:11,640
that it makes sense to have a double 
standard here where you can,

2167
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:17,340
um,
that there's some trade off between 

2168
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:19,290
freedom of expression and freedom of 
religion.

2169
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:20,200
Where,
where,

2170
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:24,630
when the freedom that's being claimed on
the religious side is the freedom not to

2171
01:49:24,631 --> 01:49:26,160
be offended,
right?

2172
01:49:26,161 --> 01:49:26,550
To,
not.

2173
01:49:26,551 --> 01:49:26,930
So,
I mean,

2174
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:27,690
what,
what really,

2175
01:49:27,691 --> 01:49:32,691
what's happening here is some number of 
muslims are demanding that non muslims 

2176
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:40,160
follow the taboos of islam.
So it's taboo for you to say anything 

2177
01:49:40,591 --> 01:49:44,580
negative about the profit or even to 
depict him in a drawing,

2178
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:45,230
right?
That's,

2179
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:49,480
that's where it gets rewarded and we 
want you to follow this taboo though you

2180
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:54,481
are not muslim and we feel so strongly 
about this that we're going to kill you 

2181
01:49:55,810 --> 01:50:00,810
or threatened to make credible threats 
of killing you or we're just going to,

2182
01:50:00,821 --> 01:50:05,821
when people do kill you,
we're going to blame you for having 

2183
01:50:05,821 --> 01:50:08,881
gotten yourself killed,
for having been so stupid and 

2184
01:50:08,881 --> 01:50:09,180
insensitive by caricaturing the profit 
and that whole.

2185
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:12,700
I mean that just has to lose.
I mean that we have to.

2186
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:17,730
We have to hold to free speech so 
unequivocallY that all the people over 

2187
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:24,781
here who think that,
that there is this trade off between 

2188
01:50:24,781 --> 01:50:27,811
religious sensitivity and free speech,
just have to realize that that they've 

2189
01:50:27,811 --> 01:50:31,771
lost because we don't play this game 
with any other religion or just think 

2190
01:50:31,771 --> 01:50:33,520
about this analogy I've used before,
but the book of mormon,

2191
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,590
right?
It just,

2192
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:39,160
it just pillories mormonism.
It makes mormonism look ridiculous,

2193
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:41,770
right?
What are the mormons do in response?

2194
01:50:41,771 --> 01:50:44,830
The mormons took out ads in playbill,
right?

2195
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:45,880
If it was,
it was very cute.

2196
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:46,870
What they did,
they took out ads.

2197
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:48,400
Like if you,
if you like the play,

2198
01:50:48,401 --> 01:50:49,060
you know,
you come,

2199
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:50,650
come and learn the real stuff.
Right.

2200
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:53,080
It was just,
it was totally civil.

2201
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:55,630
Good natured.
Find that either my favorite cult,

2202
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:56,200
right?
Yeah,

2203
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:57,280
yeah.
They really are.

2204
01:50:57,281 --> 01:50:59,260
I like them way more than I even like 
scientology,

2205
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:01,690
which is my second favorite,
but,

2206
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:06,780
but trey parker and matt stone are not 
looking over their shoulders for the 

2207
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:09,670
mormon assassins,
but they've come here about muslims.

2208
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,660
but briefly they didn't even.
They put muhammad in a bear suit.

2209
01:51:13,661 --> 01:51:15,000
It was just a bear.
Right.

2210
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:18,250
And then they had to put the bear suit 
in a van and then they pulled it off the

2211
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:23,251
air war still.
I had to pull it off the air and we're 

2212
01:51:23,251 --> 01:51:25,591
still.
It made sense for them to pull it off 

2213
01:51:25,591 --> 01:51:25,870
the air given the actual nature of the 
threat.

2214
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:28,540
And so we've.
So as I've argued,

2215
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:32,260
we have already lost our freedom of 
speech on this issue and to the,

2216
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:37,400
that one individual issue.
We've almost the only issue on earth 

2217
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:41,140
really.
And there are people on the liberal side

2218
01:51:41,141 --> 01:51:44,350
of this argument who think that is a 
good thing,

2219
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:45,130
that,
that is a,

2220
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:48,700
that you are a racist to question the,
the,

2221
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:54,350
um,
the decency of that situation and it's 

2222
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:58,360
just not truly so it's a completely 
insane doctrine that is,

2223
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:03,510
that we should not have to,
we should be able to criticize to our 

2224
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:04,270
heart's content without threats of 
violence as we,

2225
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:06,430
as we can with every other insane 
doctrine.

2226
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:09,520
Do you think that that's fear,
that's a fear of islam,

2227
01:52:09,521 --> 01:52:14,521
the fear of retaliation,
that they want to be on the side of the 

2228
01:52:14,521 --> 01:52:17,341
others because it's so dangerous because
they are the only religion that will 

2229
01:52:17,341 --> 01:52:20,851
come out and kill you.
And these same people I've found that 

2230
01:52:20,851 --> 01:52:23,410
will call people out on being 
islamophobic will not say a fucking peep

2231
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:27,750
about anti christian rhetoric.
If you start talking shit about jesus or

2232
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:33,630
christianity,
they never have a word to say about it 

2233
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:34,780
because it's not dangerous because it's 
not dangerous to be on that side.

2234
01:52:35,150 --> 01:52:38,800
I think it's much more just white guilt 
and,

2235
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:42,070
um,
and political correctness.

2236
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:44,520
There's definitely some of that as just 
a sense that it's just,

2237
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:45,740
it is.
If you take.

2238
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:50,060
Again,
I don't mean to trash abby per se.

2239
01:52:50,061 --> 01:52:51,230
If you met her,
you'd love her.

2240
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,390
She's a great person.
She's cool,

2241
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:54,350
but,
but if this is,

2242
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,480
if you take her view of our foreign 
policy,

2243
01:52:56,481 --> 01:52:59,060
if you just agreed with her down the 
line does check all those boxes.

2244
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,800
2 million people.
We did it all.

2245
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:01,690
We,
you know,

2246
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:06,700
we just kill brown skin people all over 
the world because we just liked to sell 

2247
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,750
bombs and that's really what our moral 
core,

2248
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:11,300
you know.
Then yeah.

2249
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:13,790
Then we should have a fair amount of 
white guilt.

2250
01:53:13,791 --> 01:53:18,791
Right.
Then it's understandable that you think 

2251
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:22,000
that more or less any a non western 
population that expresses a grievance 

2252
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:25,220
against us has a point.
Well,

2253
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:28,070
isn't there a real problem with saying 
our cars?

2254
01:53:28,071 --> 01:53:33,071
You and I have nothing to do with that 
and we're a part of this weird gang 

2255
01:53:33,071 --> 01:53:34,310
called the United States of America.
Whenever you say us,

2256
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:37,670
what we've done us.
I mean we haven't done shit,

2257
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:40,010
but we're somehow another lumped into 
this group.

2258
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:43,760
That's a big part of it,
but we've participated in a system,

2259
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:47,480
the existence of which is predicated on 
some of this shit,

2260
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:51,170
so existence of which existed long 
before you and I are ever born.

2261
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:53,390
We're born into a system.
We have zero control over.

2262
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:58,410
well that.
And that's why I think that some of the 

2263
01:53:58,410 --> 01:53:58,410
greatest ethical changes,
uh,

2264
01:53:58,410 --> 01:54:03,250
the greatest ethical progress for us as 
a species is going to come not with each

2265
01:54:04,221 --> 01:54:08,270
one of us developing an ethical code 
that allows us to be a hero,

2266
01:54:08,271 --> 01:54:13,271
you know,
personally and just bucking the system 

2267
01:54:13,271 --> 01:54:13,271
and bucking a trend from morning till 
night.

2268
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:16,610
We need to design systems that are more 
benign,

2269
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:17,380
you know,
so it's like,

2270
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:18,590
it comes down to the,
you know,

2271
01:54:18,591 --> 01:54:23,591
our smartphones.
Like is there a way to produce a 

2272
01:54:23,591 --> 01:54:23,750
smartphone that is ethically benign 
right now?

2273
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,750
At the moment it seems like there isn't,
or at least we're not.

2274
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:29,240
We're not being so scrupulous as to find
one.

2275
01:54:29,241 --> 01:54:31,430
But you mean as far as conflict 
minerals?

2276
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:32,820
Exactly.
All of it's like it could have,

2277
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:33,120
can,
what?

2278
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:36,760
Could we actually be good people all the
way down the supply chain,

2279
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:38,810
slave labor,
all the way down.

2280
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:41,750
Now I would pay more for that phone.
There's no question.

2281
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:46,770
What do you know?
There was a phone that they were trying 

2282
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:48,311
to produce about that.
It was called the fair phone going and 

2283
01:54:48,311 --> 01:54:48,750
it was non conflict minerals.
It was uh,

2284
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:50,540
the.
But it was only three j.

2285
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:54,230
Nobody wants a piece of shit.
That's why I'm not kidding.

2286
01:54:54,231 --> 01:54:57,230
But that's where it comes down to is 
called the fairfax are.

2287
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:02,290
Hold on.
Our better nature is so tenuous that 

2288
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:06,100
this,
the difference between four g and three 

2289
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:06,100
g could make the difference,
right?

2290
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:06,230
It's like,
yeah,

2291
01:55:06,231 --> 01:55:08,990
let's see if they've moved up to four g,
I'll fucking buy it.

2292
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:10,200
Right,
right.

2293
01:55:10,201 --> 01:55:13,640
It's got to be.
Nobody wants to be my look at that.

2294
01:55:13,641 --> 01:55:14,880
They're sold out.
Wow.

2295
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:18,620
My point is no one should have to have a
bad phone to be a good person.

2296
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:19,990
Right?
So true.

2297
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:24,350
So we want systems that is adorable,
right?

2298
01:55:24,351 --> 01:55:26,090
When you see liberals with an iphone 
six,

2299
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:27,750
like listen son,
but it's.

2300
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:28,610
No,
but it's,

2301
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:33,670
it's weird.
We are those liberals to look at that 

2302
01:55:33,670 --> 01:55:33,670
guy with a fair fall and that's what you
get when you get a fair fault.

2303
01:55:33,670 --> 01:55:34,780
That's perfect.
That goddamn brick,

2304
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:38,750
something the size of a toaster,
the ice tea video from 1988,

2305
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:43,860
that breakfast at that guy's got up to 
his ear is an unfair iphone.

2306
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,040
That

2307
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:49,040
is a terrible way to sell your phone.
Why would you have that fuck of 

2308
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,580
ridiculous?
You can't put that in your pocket sun.

2309
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:51,970
Yeah.
Well,

2310
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,790
all of those people that buy those 
things and have those,

2311
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:59,910
those extreme liberal values,
progressive values.

2312
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:04,080
You have to deal with the absolute 
reality that at the very least,

2313
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:07,200
your phone is being produced in a 
factory where people are jumping off the

2314
01:56:07,201 --> 01:56:09,120
roof.
That's a fact.

2315
01:56:09,121 --> 01:56:12,180
Unless they're making them in Korea,
the samsung phones,

2316
01:56:12,181 --> 01:56:17,181
I think ethically,
I think they have like a leg up on the 

2317
01:56:17,181 --> 01:56:20,331
iphone in the sense that you know the 
fox con buildings where they have nets 

2318
01:56:20,941 --> 01:56:24,930
installed around the building to keep 
people from jumping off the roof because

2319
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:29,931
it sucks so bad there,
and I've heard the argument against 

2320
01:56:29,931 --> 01:56:30,300
that.
All the amount of people that you got to

2321
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:35,301
deal with,
the fact that these factories employee 

2322
01:56:35,301 --> 01:56:37,250
half a million people and the number of 
people that commit suicide is directly 

2323
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:40,251
proportionate to the same number of 
people that would commit suicide in the 

2324
01:56:40,251 --> 01:56:42,120
regular population,
but they're killing themselves at work.

2325
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:43,770
Like how many people kill themselves at 
work?

2326
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:46,080
Like that's not normal and they live at 
work.

2327
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:47,670
Okay,
well that's not normal either.

2328
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:50,940
You got slaves.
These are essentially wage slaves.

2329
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:56,020
Again,
these are situations where there's 

2330
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:58,901
often,
or at least sometimes no good option 

2331
01:56:58,901 --> 01:57:03,700
immediately.
So when you think of like child labor 

2332
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:03,700
laws in a place like Pakistan,

2333
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:05,090
I know,
but look at that phone dude,

2334
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:08,410
look how beautiful that talks to you and
shit.

2335
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:13,750
Come on on that screen pretty.
I'm not going to lose any sleep at night

2336
01:57:13,751 --> 01:57:15,990
over your own enough phone.
Thanks buddy.

2337
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:21,410
Um,
I think you and I would and millions of 

2338
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:22,420
other people would probably.
I mean,

2339
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:25,120
I know I would,
but I think millions.

2340
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:30,130
If,
if we could make the problem 

2341
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:32,560
transparent,
we would pay more to be truly good 

2342
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:39,631
actors across in all of the streams of 
influence and um,

2343
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,600
but there are certain situations again 
where I just mentioned,

2344
01:57:43,601 --> 01:57:45,040
you know,
child labor laws in Pakistan,

2345
01:57:45,041 --> 01:57:49,690
if you go,
if you just say no kids can work,

2346
01:57:49,691 --> 01:57:51,070
right?
Because this is obscene.

2347
01:57:51,071 --> 01:57:51,570
This is,
you know,

2348
01:57:51,571 --> 01:57:53,980
we haven't done this in the west for 
over 100 years.

2349
01:57:53,981 --> 01:57:56,920
You know,
we don't want kids in stitching together

2350
01:57:56,921 --> 01:57:58,300
our soccer balls,
right?

2351
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:01,390
These kids should be in school.
Well,

2352
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:04,360
there are situations where that may be 
workable,

2353
01:58:04,361 --> 01:58:06,460
right?
Where you get the kid out of the factory

2354
01:58:06,461 --> 01:58:10,330
and where he's been working 14 hours a 
day and you get him into school and he's

2355
01:58:10,331 --> 01:58:11,080
got a better life.

2356
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:14,770
But there are many situations and in 
places like Pakistan,

2357
01:58:14,771 --> 01:58:19,771
where know what you've just done is 
you've made it impossible for this kid 

2358
01:58:19,771 --> 01:58:21,940
to work and you've further impoverished 
his family because he wasn't gonna go to

2359
01:58:21,941 --> 01:58:23,290
school anyway.
Now he's going to find it.

2360
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:25,780
He's going to be picking stuff out of a 
trash heap or whatever it is.

2361
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:31,380
And he,
he does that you haven't put in place 

2362
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:33,040
and alternative that's workable.
And so we in many pro with many problems

2363
01:58:33,041 --> 01:58:37,450
of this sort,
we have to find a path forward where the

2364
01:58:37,451 --> 01:58:40,840
first doors we open,
all the choice,

2365
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:44,560
the doors we have to open,
all suck,

2366
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:45,170
right?
And,

2367
01:58:45,171 --> 01:58:47,320
and there.
And there are there situations,

2368
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:52,650
geo politically that are like that where
you can either back a guy who's a 

2369
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:54,130
dictator,
right?

2370
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:59,160
But he's secular and he's committed to a
first approximation to soca basically 

2371
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:03,100
sane relations with the rest of the 
world.

2372
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:08,880
But he's,
he really is a dictator and he really 

2373
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,581
has a history of treating people badly.
And he's going to treat political 

2374
01:59:11,581 --> 01:59:14,821
dissent very badly because of the 
possible consequences for him if he 

2375
01:59:14,821 --> 01:59:16,890
doesn't,
because the society's is bursting,

2376
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:19,080
coming apart at the seams,
um,

2377
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:24,220
or you can just let the islamists and 
the jihadist run the place.

2378
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:25,720
Right?
And that is a,

2379
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:30,840
you know,
there's no good option and it's 

2380
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:32,470
understandable that we have in many 
cases chosen the dictator there.

2381
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,650
Well that was sort of the situation with
saddam hussein,

2382
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:36,120
right?
Yeah.

2383
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:37,270
Me,
psychopath.

2384
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:39,490
Children were psychopaths,
murderers,

2385
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,390
serial killers,
he did horrific things,

2386
01:59:42,391 --> 01:59:44,670
but he was very secular in the way he 
ran his country.

2387
01:59:44,870 --> 01:59:49,870
And so There we're were facing this on 
many fronts and I want to ask you this 

2388
01:59:50,071 --> 01:59:52,830
because you have these extreme opinions 
about these things.

2389
01:59:52,831 --> 01:59:57,831
You have these extreme criticisms.
If you could,

2390
01:59:57,960 --> 01:59:59,490
if ultimately someone said,
look,

2391
01:59:59,491 --> 02:00:01,080
sam,
you're going to be king of the world.

2392
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:06,030
You are going to be the guy that gets to
sort this mess out.

2393
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:09,630
We need someone to engineer a global 
culture.

2394
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:15,170
What would be the step that you would 
take to try to alleviate some of the 

2395
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:16,110
suffering of the world?
Alleviate some of the bloodshed,

2396
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:19,530
alleviate all these conflicts.
Is geopolitical conflicts

2397
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:24,570
well in this area?
The first few things I would do it we've

2398
02:00:24,571 --> 02:00:26,250
already talked about.
One is I would,

2399
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:32,360
I would make it absolutely clear that 
free speech just wins,

2400
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,700
right?
So whenever you got into a charlie hebdo

2401
02:00:35,701 --> 02:00:38,150
situation or,
um,

2402
02:00:38,370 --> 02:00:39,750
the danish cartoons,
you know,

2403
02:00:39,751 --> 02:00:43,450
the riots over those cartoons,
a we've hit,

2404
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:46,080
we've had half a dozen situations like 
that in the last 10 years.

2405
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:48,990
Um,
the people that

2406
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:55,770
even our own government can't eat what 
we're fighting a war on terror and we 

2407
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:59,290
still can't defend free speech it when,
when those situations are up.

2408
02:00:59,291 --> 02:01:03,070
So for instance,
this was over the,

2409
02:01:03,071 --> 02:01:05,710
the innocence of muslims film on,
remember that film?

2410
02:01:05,711 --> 02:01:10,180
It was a youtube film that kicked off.
I'm riots everywhere.

2411
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:11,930
Was that true though?
Because I,

2412
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:14,790
I've heard so many versions.
Okay.

2413
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:17,160
Well,
I mean the main cut benghazi thing was,

2414
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:20,670
it's true that it did kick off a riots 
everywhere,

2415
02:01:20,671 --> 02:01:24,420
but the thing that was egregious about

2416
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:25,740
are

2417
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:33,320
government statement there was that we 
basically just rather than to take the 

2418
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:35,490
totally same line of saying,
listen,

2419
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:41,180
in our society,
we were committed to freedom of speech 

2420
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,130
and you can make films about anything 
here and it that never gives you license

2421
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,540
to kill people,
right?

2422
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,570
Uh,
or to burn embassies full stop.

2423
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,570
What was adam wIth the documentary?
What it was?

2424
02:01:50,571 --> 02:01:55,571
It was a film called the innocent,
I think the innocence of muslims or 

2425
02:01:55,571 --> 02:01:55,910
innocence of muslims,
um,

2426
02:01:56,810 --> 02:02:00,110
made by some crackpot somewhere.
And it was just a youtube video,

2427
02:02:00,111 --> 02:02:05,111
but it got spun as this major scandal in
the muslim world and it reliably 

2428
02:02:07,611 --> 02:02:12,611
produced this,
this reaction of the sort that the 

2429
02:02:12,611 --> 02:02:13,630
danish cartoons had.
And um,

2430
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:18,850
we rather than just hold the line for 
free speech we have in the state 

2431
02:02:18,981 --> 02:02:20,870
department said something like,
you know,

2432
02:02:20,871 --> 02:02:24,650
we,
we totally repudiate this,

2433
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:27,080
this attack upon islam.

2434
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:30,200
And I like,
we just distanced ourselves from it just

2435
02:02:30,201 --> 02:02:33,620
as a way of,
of trying to contain the madness,

2436
02:02:33,621 --> 02:02:34,200
right?
It was,

2437
02:02:34,330 --> 02:02:39,330
it was a symptom of just how,
how afraid we are that this sort of 

2438
02:02:39,351 --> 02:02:43,210
thing can get out of hand in the muslim 
world because it can write you if,

2439
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:48,420
if there's a rumor that occur on got 
burned or if some pastor in Florida 

2440
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:53,680
threatens to burn the koran reliably,
doesn't people by the dozens get killed 

2441
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,210
in places like Afghanistan because 
they're just,

2442
02:02:57,230 --> 02:03:02,230
you know,
it's in a way that a suicide bombing 

2443
02:03:02,230 --> 02:03:03,800
between sunni and shia never produces a 
response of that sort.

2444
02:03:03,801 --> 02:03:06,320
So It's a um,
uh,

2445
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:11,560
I would hold to free speech and I would,
I would just make that because free 

2446
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:14,570
speech is the freedom that safeguards 
every other freedom.

2447
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:16,610
If you can't speak freely,
you can't.

2448
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:21,320
if you can't criticize powerful people 
or powerfully bad ideas,

2449
02:03:22,310 --> 02:03:26,970
there's just no way to,
to defend society from,

2450
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:32,200
from slipping,
slipping back into theocracy or any 

2451
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:32,390
other kind of medieval situation.

2452
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:37,450
And um,
so you have to defend free speech even 

2453
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:38,990
for even speech you don't like,
you know,

2454
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:41,380
slightly holocaust denial laws in,
in,

2455
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:46,390
in western europe.
It's illegal to deny the holocaust in 

2456
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:48,200
Germany and a few other countries.
I think Australia,

2457
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:54,500
I'm in France and it's a ludicrous law.
You should be totally free to deny the 

2458
02:03:56,091 --> 02:04:01,091
holocaust and then everyone else should 
be free to treat you like an idiot and 

2459
02:04:01,091 --> 02:04:05,501
you should be able to.
You should be free to destroy your 

2460
02:04:05,501 --> 02:04:05,501
reputation,
right?

2461
02:04:05,501 --> 02:04:07,970
The fact that we're putting people in or
that they are putting people in jail for

2462
02:04:07,971 --> 02:04:12,971
denying the holocaust is totally 
counterproductive and it does look like 

2463
02:04:12,971 --> 02:04:15,470
in defensive muslim apologists,
it does look like a double standard.

2464
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,990
You're going to put people in jail for 
denying the holocaust,

2465
02:04:17,991 --> 02:04:22,991
but you're going to alloW,
allow sharley abdo to criticize the 

2466
02:04:22,991 --> 02:04:22,991
profit.
How does that make sense?

2467
02:04:22,991 --> 02:04:24,620
Right?
I totally agree with them there.

2468
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:29,621
We should not.
We should not be criminalizing any form 

2469
02:04:29,621 --> 02:04:30,260
of speech.
So it was felt stupid.

2470
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:31,230
Yeah,
and they're so.

2471
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:36,270
But there are people tryIng to push 
through blasphemy laws as a polItician 

2472
02:04:36,270 --> 02:04:40,421
in the uk who recently just said he 
would make islamophobia a criminal 

2473
02:04:40,421 --> 02:04:40,620
offense,
right?

2474
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:45,980
He would.
I'm sure he would make the sorts of 

2475
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,970
things I say about islam criminally 
actionable in the uk,

2476
02:04:47,971 --> 02:04:52,971
right?
That this is a disaster at the wrong 

2477
02:04:52,971 --> 02:04:53,010
road to go down.
So first thing,

2478
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:55,290
and I think that's a hugely important 
thing,

2479
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:59,040
and the other piece we just talked about
is just getting off of oil.

2480
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,410
I mean,
just imagine that one change,

2481
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:06,620
right?
We could get off of oil and that would 

2482
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:11,750
prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that 
spending your life splitting hairs about

2483
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:19,620
a muslim theology and demonizing the 
rest of the world and exporting madrasa 

2484
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:27,500
you crazy madrasa by the tens of 
thousands all over the world is as the 

2485
02:05:28,531 --> 02:05:30,630
saudis do,
it would prove it.

2486
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:35,630
That is not a way to join the community 
of functional nations because absent 

2487
02:05:36,281 --> 02:05:38,490
inability to pull their wealth out of 
the ground,

2488
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:40,620
they have no intellectual content.
They don't.

2489
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:45,660
They don't produce anything of value 
that anyone wants that that's a problem 

2490
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:46,230
they would have to solve.
Right?

2491
02:05:46,231 --> 02:05:49,110
If they don't want to be beggared in in 
a global community.

2492
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:54,270
Well isn't that an issue?
Also with the ideology of the religion 

2493
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:57,351
is that you're not allowed to question 
or change or manipulate the way you 

2494
02:05:57,351 --> 02:05:59,790
approach life because it's all dictated 
by their religion.

2495
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:02,110
Finances.
Well,

2496
02:06:02,170 --> 02:06:07,170
it's part of it and just when you.
When you look at societies where they 

2497
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:10,400
keep half the population that the female
half a more or less hostage and unable 

2498
02:06:13,291 --> 02:06:17,970
to get educated or to work or to drive 
cars are made depending on which society

2499
02:06:17,971 --> 02:06:20,920
you're talking about this economically 
and socially,

2500
02:06:20,921 --> 02:06:25,921
it doesn't make any sense if you know,
in a context where you need to produce 

2501
02:06:26,341 --> 02:06:31,170
intellectual content to be part of the 
global conversation.

2502
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:36,170
So the only way they've been able to do 
this is because of the fact that they 

2503
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:36,410
have an extreme amount of mind that 
comes from more manual.

2504
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:38,940
Certainly if we're talking about the oil
states.

2505
02:06:38,941 --> 02:06:40,650
Yeah.
And so that's.

2506
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:46,370
If we,
if oil were no longer valuable and we 

2507
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:51,201
actually could get to a time where that 
would be the case where it's an oil is 

2508
02:06:51,201 --> 02:06:55,401
just just dirty,
a dirty fluid that no one wants to have 

2509
02:06:55,401 --> 02:06:55,401
anything to do with.
Right.

2510
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:57,450
Um,
it,

2511
02:06:57,451 --> 02:06:59,100
uh,
that would be,

2512
02:06:59,101 --> 02:07:04,101
that would be a huge change.
Now I'm sure there's another side of 

2513
02:07:04,101 --> 02:07:04,101
this argument where it would be a 
destabilizing change.

2514
02:07:04,101 --> 02:07:09,021
I mean,
just imagine how things will start to 

2515
02:07:09,021 --> 02:07:09,420
run off the rails and the middle east if
oil is worthless.

2516
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:14,750
Right?
And what Saudi Arabia going to be like 

2517
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:14,750
maybe arguably,
I think they've probably hedged their,

2518
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:19,710
their beds and they have so much money 
in other investments now that at least 

2519
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:20,040
the royal family would be fine.
But,

2520
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:22,740
um,
it's a,

2521
02:07:22,741 --> 02:07:27,741
um,
it's a huge part of the problem and as 

2522
02:07:27,741 --> 02:07:31,221
you pointed out,
it keeps us double dealing and,

2523
02:07:32,051 --> 02:07:33,330
and,
and being,

2524
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:34,500
um,
um,

2525
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:40,800
a captive to the cycle of,
of defending our very real economic 

2526
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:45,310
interests.
I mean really like existential interests

2527
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:47,720
in terms of our energy supply,
uh,

2528
02:07:47,721 --> 02:07:50,610
over the years and producing,
um,

2529
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:52,670
a mayhem,
um,

2530
02:07:53,050 --> 02:07:53,680
as a result.

2531
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:56,950
But how do you get someone to abandoned 
such a rigid ideology?

2532
02:07:56,951 --> 02:08:00,250
How do you get someone to open their 
mind up to the possibility that this was

2533
02:08:00,251 --> 02:08:05,251
just written by people?
There's is just a way of governing 

2534
02:08:05,251 --> 02:08:09,751
people and keeping people in line and 
which is essentially every single 

2535
02:08:09,751 --> 02:08:10,180
religion that's ever been created.

2536
02:08:10,490 --> 02:08:12,050
Well,
it happens.

2537
02:08:12,110 --> 02:08:16,940
And actually there's another point that,
that abby martin made,

2538
02:08:16,941 --> 02:08:18,710
which I agree with.
I just,

2539
02:08:18,711 --> 02:08:18,980
I,
I,

2540
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:20,480
she,
she doesn't,

2541
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:23,090
we don't agree with it for the,
we don't think this thought for the same

2542
02:08:23,091 --> 02:08:28,091
reasons,
but she pointed out that that religions 

2543
02:08:28,091 --> 02:08:28,091
change,
right?

2544
02:08:28,091 --> 02:08:29,090
That you roll back the clock.
Five hundred or so years,

2545
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:32,300
christians were burning people alive and
pro,

2546
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:36,470
actively proper prosecuted people for 
blasphemy.

2547
02:08:36,471 --> 02:08:41,471
You had the inquisition in europe and 
that was every bit as much of a horror 

2548
02:08:41,471 --> 02:08:42,650
show is what's going on in Iraq now.
So look,

2549
02:08:42,651 --> 02:08:45,050
christianity can be just as bad as 
islam.

2550
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:49,940
Now it's true as a matter of history,
that is in fact true.

2551
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:55,480
There are differences between islam and 
christianity that are nevertheless 

2552
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:57,440
important,
but the crucial pieces that christianity

2553
02:08:57,441 --> 02:08:59,810
did not change from the inside.
You know,

2554
02:08:59,811 --> 02:09:04,811
christianity got hammered from the 
outside by a renaissanCe and reformation

2555
02:09:06,741 --> 02:09:08,390
initially,
which was bloody and horrible,

2556
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:12,320
but it got hammered by a,
a,

2557
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:17,710
the forces of a scientific revolution 
and an attendant industrial revolution 

2558
02:09:19,161 --> 02:09:24,161
and capitalism and the rest of culture 
that didn't want to be shackled to 

2559
02:09:24,161 --> 02:09:26,150
theocracy for very good reason.

2560
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:28,070
Right?
And so like,

2561
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:30,170
once you have a real science of 
medicine,

2562
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:35,200
you don't have to ask the priest while 
your child was flopping around on the 

2563
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,070
floor.
And when the priest diagnosis as demonic

2564
02:09:37,071 --> 02:09:39,170
possession,
you don't take it seriously,

2565
02:09:39,171 --> 02:09:39,640
right?
you know,

2566
02:09:39,641 --> 02:09:41,730
you now,
you now have a neurologist to talk to.

2567
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:42,710
I mean this is,
these are,

2568
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:48,100
there's progress made outside of 
religion which propagates back to 

2569
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:50,480
religion and applies a lot of pressure 
to it.

2570
02:09:50,481 --> 02:09:55,481
So.
So christianity has been humbled and 

2571
02:09:55,481 --> 02:09:57,920
mastered by the secular world,
by humanism,

2572
02:09:57,921 --> 02:10:02,921
by science,
by the rest of our conversation with 

2573
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:06,401
ourselves.
And this has not happened in the muslim 

2574
02:10:06,401 --> 02:10:06,401
world.
And it should happen.

2575
02:10:06,401 --> 02:10:07,880
It has to happen.
We have to figure out how to engineer it

2576
02:10:07,881 --> 02:10:09,050
for muslims.
And it's not,

2577
02:10:09,051 --> 02:10:10,580
again,
it's not going to come from the outside,

2578
02:10:10,581 --> 02:10:10,930
you know,
the,

2579
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:12,330
you know,
non muslims,

2580
02:10:12,331 --> 02:10:13,880
they're not going to force it on 
muslims.

2581
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:18,880
But we have to support the genuine 
reformers and the people who are,

2582
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:24,890
who are fighting for the rights of women
and gays and free thinkers in the muslim

2583
02:10:24,891 --> 02:10:29,891
world.
And the hoRrible thing is that the 

2584
02:10:29,891 --> 02:10:29,900
liberals,
the liberals on our side don't do that.

2585
02:10:29,901 --> 02:10:34,010
The liberalS on our side criticize 
people like me and even ayaan hirsi ali,

2586
02:10:34,011 --> 02:10:35,600
you know,
a former muslim who,

2587
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:39,140
who has a,
was being hunted by theocrats,

2588
02:10:39,141 --> 02:10:42,560
rIght?
They criticize her as a bigot for how,

2589
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:47,620
how unsparing her criticism is of islam.
Whereas she is fighting for the rights 

2590
02:10:48,381 --> 02:10:50,780
of women to be equal in the muslim 
world.

2591
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:55,840
Right?
And so there are liberal liberalism has 

2592
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:56,180
just,
has truly lost the plot here.

2593
02:10:56,181 --> 02:11:00,810
And we have to be committed to the same.
I mean,

2594
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:05,820
we,
we are concerned about the rights of 

2595
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:05,820
women in silicon valley,
right?

2596
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:06,890
I mean,
that's how it feet.

2597
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:09,470
Our concerns are now like where,
why aren't,

2598
02:11:09,471 --> 02:11:12,950
why isn't there an equal number of women
in venture capital?

2599
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:14,690
Now,
what a fucking scandal,

2600
02:11:14,691 --> 02:11:16,460
right?
There are people who can go on for hours

2601
02:11:16,461 --> 02:11:17,030
about that.
Right?

2602
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:19,640
I'm not saying it's not a pathetic 
potential scandal.

2603
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:21,140
Great.
Let's talk about that scandal.

2604
02:11:21,141 --> 02:11:23,990
But let's talk about the fact that,
you know,

2605
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,210
girls,
six years of age are getting clear,

2606
02:11:27,211 --> 02:11:32,211
direct dummies by barbarians in septic 
conditions.

2607
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:36,050
And everyone around them think is a good
and necessary thing,

2608
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:37,980
right?
Um,

2609
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:43,720
and you know,
women who get raped get killed because 

2610
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:43,880
they brought dishonor on their family.
I mean,

2611
02:11:43,881 --> 02:11:44,940
this is,
this is.

2612
02:11:44,941 --> 02:11:49,941
There's another planet over there that 
we have to interact with because it's 

2613
02:11:49,941 --> 02:11:50,780
violent.
It's coming our way for no other reason,

2614
02:11:50,781 --> 02:11:53,490
but there's another reason.
There's the ethical imperative of,

2615
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:55,970
of figuring out how to help people who 
are,

2616
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:59,300
who are hostage to a bad system.
And,

2617
02:11:59,510 --> 02:12:01,550
and um,
so yeah,

2618
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:04,700
let's be,
let's be for women's rights globally,

2619
02:12:04,701 --> 02:12:05,540
but what does that look like?

2620
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:10,540
That looks like a rather staunch 
criticism of the way women are treated 

2621
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:14,711
under islam.
There's a lot of seemingly openminded 

2622
02:12:14,711 --> 02:12:18,100
european cultures that have opened the 
door for a lot of islamic immigrants or 

2623
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:19,130
muslim immigrants to come over to their 
country.

2624
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:24,131
Now they're dealing with a lot of the 
issues that involve these ideologies 

2625
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:26,750
being a part of their culture now.
Yeah.

2626
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:32,350
Well,
I mean they are in a situation similar 

2627
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:33,860
to ours with latin America where they 
just,

2628
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:35,750
they need immigrant labor,
right?

2629
02:12:35,751 --> 02:12:40,751
They haVe a.
They're actually worse than the us in 

2630
02:12:40,751 --> 02:12:43,480
terms of their replacement rate.
You got a bunch of countries in western 

2631
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:45,550
europe who are becoming these senescent 
populations.

2632
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:50,560
They're just not replacing themselves 
and they need immigrant labor and the 

2633
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:54,910
real,
the most of the available labor is 

2634
02:12:54,910 --> 02:12:55,790
coming from,
from the muslim world.

2635
02:12:55,820 --> 02:13:00,820
And then you also have the problem of 
political refugees who are leaving war 

2636
02:13:01,851 --> 02:13:05,030
torn places for obvious reasons and 
winding up in the closest,

2637
02:13:05,870 --> 02:13:06,860
closest shores,
you know,

2638
02:13:06,861 --> 02:13:07,910
across the mediterranean.

2639
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:10,670
And um,
so yeah,

2640
02:13:10,671 --> 02:13:15,671
it's a,
the people they're attracting are 

2641
02:13:15,671 --> 02:13:18,161
different from,
from the many muslim immigrants we get 

2642
02:13:18,161 --> 02:13:21,170
in the us who are coming to work for 
google or to the,

2643
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:26,180
they get engineering degrees are two 
different demographic largely.

2644
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:32,040
Okay.
I think we've covered that suBject into 

2645
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,040
the ground or so.
So let me,

2646
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,800
I'll just mention the things on this 
list and you can send me a big kiss.

2647
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:36,270
And again I don't.
I hope,

2648
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:39,220
I hope what I said about abby didn't 
seem mean spirited.

2649
02:13:39,221 --> 02:13:40,180
I'm just like,
she just,

2650
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:42,000
she actually is wrong about me.
And,

2651
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:47,030
and if I'm wrong about her,
I'm happy to be enlightened on that 

2652
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:47,080
topic.
Will be interesting to her two hours.

2653
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:49,200
Sit down together.
That'd be hilarious.

2654
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:51,450
You.
I'll bring the tequila.

2655
02:13:52,090 --> 02:13:55,650
Is that what's necessary for me to bring
my own tequila?

2656
02:13:56,150 --> 02:13:58,570
Um,
so what did freewill.

2657
02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:01,950
I think this comes up again,
a ai,

2658
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:04,170
which is that something you concerned 
with?

2659
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:05,190
Yeah,
I did.

2660
02:14:05,191 --> 02:14:08,040
I actually just blogged about this and 
digital and spoke about it,

2661
02:14:08,041 --> 02:14:13,041
but I think it was in my head to talk 
about because I heard you talk about it 

2662
02:14:13,041 --> 02:14:17,120
with someone.
It might have been duncan trussell most 

2663
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:17,120
likely.
I've talked about it many times,

2664
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:20,070
but hey,
I just got onto this.

2665
02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:24,600
I'm on the bandwagon here because I 
hadn't really thought about it at all.

2666
02:14:24,601 --> 02:14:27,840
I'm not really a scifi geek.
I don't read science fiction.

2667
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:33,440
And the word in neuroscience has been 
for a very long time.

2668
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:39,120
And really science generally is it ai 
hasn't panned out.

2669
02:14:39,121 --> 02:14:44,121
it's not that it's inconceivable was 
something interesting is going to 

2670
02:14:44,121 --> 02:14:46,020
happen,
but it has been old style.

2671
02:14:46,021 --> 02:14:51,021
Ai was really a dead end and we never 
really got out of that particular 

2672
02:14:51,021 --> 02:14:53,040
culdesac and,
and we just haven't made much progress.

2673
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:54,550
And so we have,
you know,

2674
02:14:54,551 --> 02:14:57,870
the best chess player in the world is a 
computer the size of this table,

2675
02:14:57,871 --> 02:14:59,350
but,
um,

2676
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:04,680
the prospect of having truly general 
artificial intelligence,

2677
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:08,400
uh,
and super human level intelligence,

2678
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:12,510
that's not something we have to worry 
about in the near term at all.

2679
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:14,250
But then I,
um,

2680
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,170
I heaRd a,
as many people did a,

2681
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:23,120
my friend,
my friend elan musk say something which 

2682
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:25,620
seemed quite a hyperbolic.
He thought it wAs the greatest threat to

2683
02:15:25,621 --> 02:15:27,960
humanity,
probably worse than nuclear weapons.

2684
02:15:28,650 --> 02:15:30,750
And there was a lot of pushback against 
him,

2685
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:31,800
uh,
there.

2686
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,930
and,
but,

2687
02:15:33,931 --> 02:15:34,530
you know,
I actually,

2688
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:35,850
I know ilan and I,
I,

2689
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:39,900
I knew he wouldn't say that without any 
basis for it.

2690
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:44,960
And it just so happened there was a 
conference that had been scheduled long 

2691
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,921
before in puerto rico in san juan that 
was really like a closed door conference

2692
02:15:49,141 --> 02:15:52,530
for the people who are really at the 
cutting edge of ai research.

2693
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:54,510
It was organized by the future of life 
institute,

2694
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:56,700
which is a,
a,

2695
02:15:56,701 --> 02:15:59,730
um,
a nonprofit purpose toward,

2696
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:03,120
to kind of looking at,
at the existential threat and,

2697
02:16:03,150 --> 02:16:05,220
and looking at,
and in this case how to,

2698
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:09,420
how to create a but not foreseeing the,
the,

2699
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:10,650
the,
um,

2700
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:13,710
the existential problems around the 
development of ai.

2701
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,320
And it was a conference.
I mean,

2702
02:16:16,321 --> 02:16:18,780
maybe there were 70 people at the 
conference and it was,

2703
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:21,420
it was all people who are doing this 
work.

2704
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:24,230
And,
um,

2705
02:16:25,030 --> 02:16:25,680
a couple,
I mean,

2706
02:16:25,681 --> 02:16:27,630
I,
I literally think I was one of maybe two

2707
02:16:27,631 --> 02:16:29,740
people who had sort of talked his way 
into the conference.

2708
02:16:29,741 --> 02:16:31,210
Everyone else was just invited and they 
were,

2709
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:34,170
they had a good reason to be there.
And um,

2710
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:37,710
what was interesting is that outside 
this conference,

2711
02:16:37,711 --> 02:16:40,230
ilan was getting into a lot of pushback.
Like,

2712
02:16:40,650 --> 02:16:45,650
dude,
you don't know what you're talking 

2713
02:16:45,650 --> 02:16:45,650
about.
Go back to your rockets and your cars,

2714
02:16:45,650 --> 02:16:46,080
but you don't know anything about 
computers apparently.

2715
02:16:46,730 --> 02:16:49,080
And he was getting this pushback from 
serious people.

2716
02:16:49,081 --> 02:16:54,081
People who like are on the edge.org
website where I also occasionally 

2717
02:16:56,131 --> 02:17:01,131
published and you know,
roboticists at mit and people who 

2718
02:17:01,131 --> 02:17:05,151
should,
he have a former top people at 

2719
02:17:05,151 --> 02:17:07,461
microsoft,
people who you think are very close to 

2720
02:17:07,461 --> 02:17:07,461
this would would say,
no,

2721
02:17:07,461 --> 02:17:10,310
no,
this is 50 or 100 years out and this,

2722
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:13,050
this is crazy.
Um,

2723
02:17:14,070 --> 02:17:19,070
and so anyway,
I went to this conference just wanting 

2724
02:17:19,070 --> 02:17:22,010
to see what was,
what was up and what was interesting and

2725
02:17:22,011 --> 02:17:27,011
I frankly scary was that at the 
conference even among people who were 

2726
02:17:28,710 --> 02:17:33,710
clearly drunk the kool aid and are just 
not willing to pull the brakes on this 

2727
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:33,810
at all.
I mean they don't even,

2728
02:17:34,010 --> 02:17:39,010
it's arguably,
it's hard to conceive of how you would 

2729
02:17:39,010 --> 02:17:39,010
pull the brakes on this because the,
the,

2730
02:17:39,010 --> 02:17:40,740
the incentive to make these 
breakthroughs,

2731
02:17:40,741 --> 02:17:42,840
financial aid are so huge that,
you know,

2732
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:44,460
if you don't do it,
someone will.

2733
02:17:44,461 --> 02:17:46,500
And so everyone's just,
it's just pedal to the metal.

2734
02:17:46,501 --> 02:17:47,560
But,
um,

2735
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:56,200
basically even the people who were going
at this most aggressively were people 

2736
02:18:00,021 --> 02:18:05,021
who were conceding that huge.
It was not at all fanciful to say that 

2737
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:09,240
huge breakthroughs in artificial general
intelligence could come in,

2738
02:18:09,241 --> 02:18:09,760
uh,
in,

2739
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:11,570
in five or 10 years.
Right?

2740
02:18:11,571 --> 02:18:14,330
Given the nature of the progress that 
had been made in the last 10 years.

2741
02:18:14,930 --> 02:18:18,920
And the scary thing is that when you,
when you look at the details,

2742
02:18:18,921 --> 02:18:23,921
it's not at all obvious to see a path 
forward that doesn't just destroy us.

2743
02:18:25,490 --> 02:18:28,190
It's because it's not.
You think that,

2744
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:33,410
yeah,
I think most people's default bias,

2745
02:18:33,411 --> 02:18:36,680
and it was mine frankly go into this,
was well this,

2746
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:39,230
this probably kind of like y two k,
right?

2747
02:18:39,231 --> 02:18:40,550
Everyone is worried that,
you know,

2748
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:45,580
the clocks are going to change and all 
of our computers are going to seize up 

2749
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:47,240
and we're gonna have a real problem on 
our hands,

2750
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:50,900
but that clock changes and nothing 
happens.

2751
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:51,890
Right?
So this is just,

2752
02:18:51,891 --> 02:18:56,891
you've got a bunch of nerds worried 
about something that just doesn't 

2753
02:18:56,891 --> 02:18:56,891
happen.
Right?

2754
02:18:56,891 --> 02:19:00,520
So is that an analogy for the situation?
And I.

2755
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:05,600
And it really isn't.
It's what's going on here as you're 

2756
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:09,250
talking about.
And even in the most benign.

2757
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:14,500
Caitlin,
let me just step back because I'm 

2758
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:14,500
assuming that a lot of people understand
what we're talking about here.

2759
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:15,500
The,

2760
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:21,520
what we're talking about is,
is producing what's called strong ai or 

2761
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:25,250
or often called agi,
artificial general intelligence.

2762
02:19:25,251 --> 02:19:30,251
You're talking about a machine that is 
where the intelligence is not brittle.

2763
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:31,660
It's not like,
you know,

2764
02:19:31,661 --> 02:19:35,060
like you know that the best chess 
playing computer in the world can't play

2765
02:19:35,061 --> 02:19:36,170
tic tac toe,
right?

2766
02:19:36,171 --> 02:19:36,650
So it's like,
it.

2767
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:38,870
All it can do is play chess.
So it's not,

2768
02:19:38,871 --> 02:19:43,871
it's not a general intelligence.
You're talking about something that is 

2769
02:19:43,871 --> 02:19:48,490
a,
that learns how to learn in such a way 

2770
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:52,710
that the learning transfer is to novel 
situations and it's,

2771
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:54,500
it's,
uh,

2772
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:57,200
doesn't degrade.
If you give it a new problem,

2773
02:19:57,350 --> 02:20:00,830
it won't.
It won't get worse at the other problems

2774
02:20:00,831 --> 02:20:03,260
that it got good at it because you're 
giving it new problems now.

2775
02:20:03,270 --> 02:20:08,270
So you're getting something that's,
that's that scales that can move into 

2776
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:08,270
new territories.
They can,

2777
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:11,480
they can be,
they can become better at learning.

2778
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:16,480
And in the,
in the ultimate case can make 

2779
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:19,211
improvements to itself mean once these 
machines become the best designers of 

2780
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:22,880
the next iteration of software and 
hardware.

2781
02:20:22,881 --> 02:20:26,220
Well then you get this sort of,
this exponential takeoff function,

2782
02:20:26,221 --> 02:20:31,221
or you know,
often called the singularity where you 

2783
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:31,221
have something where there's a runaway 
effect where they were,

2784
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:32,060
it's just,
you can't.

2785
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:35,680
This is now that the capacities are,
are,

2786
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:38,720
um,
it's gotten away from you.

2787
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:42,200
And um,
so the,

2788
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:46,220
you imagine what's often said is that 
we're going to build something.

2789
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:49,730
The near term goal is to build something
that's human level intelligence,

2790
02:20:49,731 --> 02:20:50,550
right?
So you're going to build that.

2791
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:54,470
We have a chess computer that's not 
quite as good as a person and then it is

2792
02:20:54,471 --> 02:20:57,200
as good as a person and now it's a 
little better than a person,

2793
02:20:57,201 --> 02:21:01,070
but it's still not so much better is to 
be completely uncanny to us.

2794
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:03,740
And we're thinking of doing that for 
everything.

2795
02:21:03,741 --> 02:21:08,741
But the truth is that as a mirage,
we're not going to build a human level 

2796
02:21:08,741 --> 02:21:10,130
agi.
Once we build an agi,

2797
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,610
it's going to be better at which you'd 
say,

2798
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:15,980
once we build a true,
truly generalizable intelligence,

2799
02:21:15,981 --> 02:21:20,981
something that can prove mathematical 
theorems and make scientific hypotheses 

2800
02:21:20,981 --> 02:21:21,620
and test them,
and,

2801
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:22,990
um,
you know,

2802
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:28,000
everything a human can do,
it's going to be so much better than a 

2803
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,530
human because of,
for a variety of reasons.

2804
02:21:30,531 --> 02:21:33,440
One is that your phone is already better
than you.

2805
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:37,280
I mean super human in many respects.
It has a super human memory.

2806
02:21:37,610 --> 02:21:39,830
It has a super human capacity to 
calculate,

2807
02:21:39,831 --> 02:21:40,450
right?
So it's a,

2808
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:42,860
it's a.
And if you hook it to the internet,

2809
02:21:42,861 --> 02:21:46,010
it has potential access to all of human 
knowledge,

2810
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:51,011
right?
So we're not going to build a human 

2811
02:21:51,011 --> 02:21:51,011
level,
agi,

2812
02:21:51,011 --> 02:21:52,520
we're going to build something that is 
going to be not an agi,

2813
02:21:52,521 --> 02:21:52,730
right?

2814
02:21:52,730 --> 02:21:56,150
It's going to be like a dumb chess 
playing computer until it isn't,

2815
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:59,150
and then it's going to be super human,
right?

2816
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:04,180
And when you're talking about something 
that runs a potentially a million times 

2817
02:22:05,841 --> 02:22:09,470
or more faster than a human brain.
So you're not talking about a biological

2818
02:22:09,471 --> 02:22:11,740
system,
now you're talking about photons.

2819
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:15,980
Um,
it could make you just,

2820
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:17,820
you just do the math and you see that,
you know,

2821
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:21,890
this thing is running for a week that is
the equivalent of 20,000

2822
02:22:21,891 --> 02:22:26,891
years of intellectual progress.
So it's just like what you get the 

2823
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:28,800
people alive in a room for 20,000
years,

2824
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:34,250
right?
With access to all of the world's 

2825
02:22:34,250 --> 02:22:34,250
information and an ability to model,
you know,

2826
02:22:34,250 --> 02:22:37,440
new experiments and computational 
abilities of the sort that,

2827
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:42,570
that we don't can't imagine.
And twentY thousand years from now,

2828
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:44,130
what are they going to come back to you 
with that,

2829
02:22:44,131 --> 02:22:46,530
that's going to be one week of this 
machine running,

2830
02:22:46,531 --> 02:22:46,680
right?

2831
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:48,180
So this is how this thing sort of 
escapes,

2832
02:22:48,181 --> 02:22:53,181
like what,
how do we feel that we can control the 

2833
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:58,970
goals and the behavior of a system that 
is capable of making 20,000

2834
02:23:00,601 --> 02:23:02,610
years of progress in a week.
Right?

2835
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:04,600
Um,
and what,

2836
02:23:04,770 --> 02:23:08,640
when you hear about how they're going 
about designing these systems,

2837
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:11,220
it is kind of uncanny.
They're talking about designing,

2838
02:23:11,221 --> 02:23:16,221
you know,
like black black box and the systems 

2839
02:23:16,221 --> 02:23:18,040
were in.
The first thing you want to do is not 

2840
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:18,040
give it access to the internet,
right?

2841
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:20,010
You're what?
Just going to cage this thing,

2842
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:22,260
right?
So because you don't want to get out,

2843
02:23:22,261 --> 02:23:22,680
right?
So,

2844
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:25,020
but you want to attempt it.
You want to see that it.

2845
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:26,790
See if it's trying to get out,
right?

2846
02:23:26,791 --> 02:23:30,090
So you're going to give it like a dummy 
ether net port that you're monitoring,

2847
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:32,320
right?
I mean this is the,

2848
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:32,970
the,
the,

2849
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:38,130
the people doing this work at the 
highest level are talking about games 

2850
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:41,901
like this where like how do you know 
whether the thing is lying to you that 

2851
02:23:41,901 --> 02:23:41,901
tried to make.

2852
02:23:41,901 --> 02:23:46,460
How do you,
how do you know whether it knows about 

2853
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:46,460
the internet,
how do you know whether it.

2854
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:51,170
So this is called a honeypot strategy.
Were you tempted to make certain moves 

2855
02:23:51,170 --> 02:23:53,640
in the direction of acquiring more power
than you wanted to give it?

2856
02:23:53,641 --> 02:23:54,350
And then you can just,
you know,

2857
02:23:54,900 --> 02:23:58,800
shut it off immediately.
But you're talking about guys,

2858
02:23:58,801 --> 02:23:59,420
you know,
um,

2859
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:04,760
who are a lot younger than us,
who many of whom are somewhere on the 

2860
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:10,890
asperger's continuum who are drinking a 
lot of red bull and,

2861
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:16,100
and uh,
have billions of dollars at their 

2862
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:18,030
disposal to,
to do this work.

2863
02:24:18,090 --> 02:24:20,670
And um,
uh,

2864
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:26,120
there's a,
there's a huge responsibility not to do 

2865
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:26,460
anything that obviously destroys the 
world.

2866
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:31,490
And the problem is even when you think 
even when you think about the most 

2867
02:24:31,490 --> 02:24:36,111
benign versions of this,
the possibility of destroying the world 

2868
02:24:36,111 --> 02:24:38,220
is not fanciful.
So like it just forget about what I just

2869
02:24:38,221 --> 02:24:39,630
said about 20,000
years of progress.

2870
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:42,810
Just imagine we build this.
We have an ai.

2871
02:24:42,811 --> 02:24:43,520
If someone,
you know,

2872
02:24:43,521 --> 02:24:45,600
working for facebook or whatever builds 
this thing,

2873
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:49,710
it's totally with solved what's called 
the control problem.

2874
02:24:49,711 --> 02:24:52,800
We figured out how to keep this thing 
doing our bidding,

2875
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:53,550
right?
It doesn't,

2876
02:24:53,551 --> 02:24:57,040
it's not gonna design come up with near 
term goals that,

2877
02:24:57,180 --> 02:25:00,150
that are antithetical to human 
happiness.

2878
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:02,130
Like because it's just a nontrivial 
problem.

2879
02:25:02,131 --> 02:25:02,820
If you say,
okay,

2880
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:05,490
just have to be committed to human 
wellbeing,

2881
02:25:05,491 --> 02:25:05,970
right?
If that,

2882
02:25:05,971 --> 02:25:08,310
if that's the foundational architecture 
of the system,

2883
02:25:08,860 --> 02:25:13,860
um,
it depends what that means in certain 

2884
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:13,860
cases.
I mean,

2885
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:13,860
what if the,
the thing the size,

2886
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:14,190
okay,
if I'm,

2887
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:19,280
if I'm committed to human well being,
I'm going to kill all the unhappy 

2888
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:19,280
people,
right?

2889
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:22,631
Or I'm just going to plug it electrodes 
into the right part of the brain of 

2890
02:25:22,631 --> 02:25:22,631
every humAn being and give them just 
pure pleasure,

2891
02:25:22,631 --> 02:25:22,631
right?

2892
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:25,020
You have to solve these problems.
Um,

2893
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:29,590
but so let's say we build something,
it's totally under our control.

2894
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:32,710
It works perfectly and we don't have to 
worry about the control problem.

2895
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:38,310
We still have to worry about the,
the political and economic effects of 

2896
02:25:38,310 --> 02:25:41,260
building something that's going to put 
the better part of humanity out of work,

2897
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:42,130
right?
I mean,

2898
02:25:42,131 --> 02:25:47,131
you're talking about now something they 
can build further iterations of itself 

2899
02:25:47,131 --> 02:25:51,810
where the cost of building versions of 
itself now is going to plummet as more 

2900
02:25:51,810 --> 02:25:53,660
or less the cost of raw materials.
You're talking about a,

2901
02:25:53,710 --> 02:25:58,710
a labor saving device of a sort that no 
one has ever anticipated and we don't 

2902
02:25:59,771 --> 02:26:02,440
have a political system that can absorb 
that.

2903
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:05,620
We have a political system where we 
would see the cover of some,

2904
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:08,080
some picture of some trillionaire on 
the,

2905
02:26:08,081 --> 02:26:12,720
on the cover of ink magazine,
and we would hear that,

2906
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:17,350
that unemployment now is it 30 percent 
even among white collar people?

2907
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:19,360
Um,
and so we need,

2908
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:20,910
we need to,
even if we were going to,

2909
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:23,200
I mean it's,
it's humbling to realize that even if we

2910
02:26:23,201 --> 02:26:25,690
were given the perfectly labor saving 
device,

2911
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:28,030
it could still,
it can screw up the world.

2912
02:26:28,031 --> 02:26:29,770
We couldn't,
we couldn't share,

2913
02:26:29,830 --> 02:26:33,070
we couldn't reliaBly share that wealth 
with all of humanity,

2914
02:26:33,310 --> 02:26:38,310
which is of course what we should do,
but we're in a system where the chinese 

2915
02:26:38,310 --> 02:26:42,661
and the rUssians would probably 
reasonably worried that we're going to 

2916
02:26:42,661 --> 02:26:43,810
use this thing to,
as the ultimate tool of war,

2917
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:46,090
right?
Both terrestrial and cyber.

2918
02:26:46,690 --> 02:26:49,690
So just imagine the cyber war and the 
drone war.

2919
02:26:49,691 --> 02:26:54,691
We could unleash on the rest of the 
world if we had the ultimate war making 

2920
02:26:56,261 --> 02:26:57,310
computer,
right?

2921
02:26:57,311 --> 02:27:02,311
And they didn't.
So this is like a winner take all 

2922
02:27:02,311 --> 02:27:02,500
scenario that is unsustainable 
politically.

2923
02:27:02,501 --> 02:27:07,501
So we have to get politically,
we have to be in a position and 

2924
02:27:07,501 --> 02:27:09,130
economically where if this thing were 
handed to us,

2925
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:14,700
we could use it for benign purposes and 
share the wealth and where we're not 

2926
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:14,700
even,
we're not there yet.

2927
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:19,650
And that is the best case scenario that 
isn't even dealing with any of the 

2928
02:27:19,650 --> 02:27:22,510
problems of this thing be having a will 
of its own,

2929
02:27:22,511 --> 02:27:27,511
which of course it would.
Is it possible that it's the next stage 

2930
02:27:27,511 --> 02:27:28,000
of life?
Yeah.

2931
02:27:28,001 --> 02:27:30,340
Well that's the other uncanny thing at 
this conference,

2932
02:27:30,341 --> 02:27:34,420
you had a few people whose names escape 
me.

2933
02:27:34,421 --> 02:27:39,421
Unfortunately I'm,
I'm actually know the rules of the 

2934
02:27:39,421 --> 02:27:40,060
conference where I couldn't even mention
their names if they hadn't escaped me.

2935
02:27:40,061 --> 02:27:41,460
So I'm really,
yeah.

2936
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:44,140
whoa.
A secret rules,

2937
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:49,440
whether it's called the chatham house 
rules at certain conferences are 

2938
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:52,800
organized under in board meetings,
are organized under these rules where 

2939
02:27:53,321 --> 02:27:54,610
you.
Because you want to encourage.

2940
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:55,780
So there's no press there.
Right.

2941
02:27:55,781 --> 02:28:00,781
And you want to encourage just free 
exchange of ideas and you can talk about

2942
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:07,320
what was talked about there,
but you can't give any attribution and 

2943
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:07,320
you can't.

2944
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:07,320
I mean,
nothing's.

2945
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:09,600
Nothing's formally at puerto rico.
Oh,

2946
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:11,260
you got to go to another country.
Sort of.

2947
02:28:11,710 --> 02:28:12,810
Not really,
but sort of.

2948
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:14,530
Yeah.
I don't know that that was.

2949
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:15,850
I think it was just they were looking 
for good.

2950
02:28:15,851 --> 02:28:17,510
Whether it was in the middle of the 
trees.

2951
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:22,700
They had plans they wanted to go to 
where that giant arecibo is not the,

2952
02:28:22,701 --> 02:28:27,701
uh,
one of the big telescopes they use to 

2953
02:28:27,701 --> 02:28:28,940
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
from the movie contact.

2954
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:30,520
Isn't that in puerto rico?
No,

2955
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:32,140
I don't know.
A cbo disc.

2956
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:36,170
That's it.
So they have some of those things in the

2957
02:28:36,171 --> 02:28:36,950
southern hemisphere.

2958
02:28:39,530 --> 02:28:41,870
So then it was.
Oh,

2959
02:28:41,910 --> 02:28:46,910
so your question,
your question about whether the next 

2960
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:46,910
day,
july,

2961
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:46,910
I mean,
are we at caterpillar?

2962
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:49,310
So anyone giving birth to a butterfly 
that we're not aware of.

2963
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:54,340
Essentially one,
one of these guys gave a talk that was 

2964
02:28:54,340 --> 02:28:58,030
all purpose toward making that ethical 
case that this is that puerto rico?

2965
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:01,260
Yeah.
They're talking to aliens brown.

2966
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:06,310
Not even letting you know that already.
They're already planning aliens are 

2967
02:29:06,310 --> 02:29:06,310
making these things.
They're making an alien.

2968
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:08,620
That's what an alien looks that.
But that's the thing,

2969
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:13,880
this thing that then gets that weird,
like when you imagine this thing getting

2970
02:29:15,351 --> 02:29:16,010
away from us.
Yeah,

2971
02:29:16,011 --> 02:29:21,011
it would be its own.
Now whether or not it would be 

2972
02:29:21,011 --> 02:29:21,011
conscious.
I mean I,

2973
02:29:21,011 --> 02:29:24,171
I am actually agnostic as to whether or 
not a super intelligent computer would 

2974
02:29:24,171 --> 02:29:25,640
by definition be conscious.
It could be unconscious,

2975
02:29:25,641 --> 02:29:30,641
it could be that it could be nothing 
that is like to be that sort of system 

2976
02:29:30,641 --> 02:29:30,740
or,
or it could be conscious.

2977
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:33,620
But in any case,
this one guy gave a talk.

2978
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:39,970
One guy gave a talk where he,
where he just speculated about this 

2979
02:29:39,970 --> 02:29:44,651
thing taking off and more or less 
standing in relation to us.

2980
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:49,900
The way we stand in relation to bacteria
or snails are life forms that we just 

2981
02:29:50,301 --> 02:29:55,301
squash without a qualm and that that's a
total totally benign acceptable.

2982
02:29:57,801 --> 02:30:00,080
Not,
not only acceptable but to be hoped for.

2983
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:05,110
Right?
Because we are anyway and I can sort of 

2984
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:05,110
follow.
I can follow him there at least halfway.

2985
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:10,420
If you imagine that these are conscious 
and actually become the center of the 

2986
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:14,690
greatest possible happiness in the 
universe.

2987
02:30:14,691 --> 02:30:15,610
Right?
So like if it's,

2988
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:20,770
if you imAgine we build,
if we give birth to a conscious machine 

2989
02:30:21,230 --> 02:30:23,000
that is essentially a god,
right,

2990
02:30:23,001 --> 02:30:28,001
that has interests and states of 
pleasure and insight and meaning that we

2991
02:30:28,581 --> 02:30:29,660
can't even imagine.

2992
02:30:29,990 --> 02:30:34,010
Right.
That is that thing by definition,

2993
02:30:34,011 --> 02:30:36,410
by my definition becomes more important 
than us.

2994
02:30:36,530 --> 02:30:41,530
Right.
Then we really are like the chickens 

2995
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:41,530
that,
you know,

2996
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:43,580
I hope we don't kill them to eat them,
but they're just chickens and we're more

2997
02:30:43,581 --> 02:30:48,581
important because we have a greater 
greater scope to our pains and 

2998
02:30:48,581 --> 02:30:52,901
pleasures.
And that's not to say that I don't see 

2999
02:30:52,901 --> 02:30:54,971
any moral problem with killing chickens.
I'm just saying that we are more 

3000
02:30:54,971 --> 02:30:57,461
important than chickens because of the 
nature of human experience and it's 

3001
02:30:57,461 --> 02:31:00,080
possibilities.
But if we build a machine that stands in

3002
02:31:00,081 --> 02:31:02,180
relation to us,
the way we stand in relation to chickens

3003
02:31:02,181 --> 02:31:04,300
or or far beyond,
right?

3004
02:31:04,301 --> 02:31:09,301
I mean there's the,
there's nowhere written that the 

3005
02:31:09,301 --> 02:31:12,401
spectrum of possible intelligence and 
somewhere close to where we are.

3006
02:31:13,010 --> 02:31:18,010
Not only that there's nowhere written 
that they cannot create far better 

3007
02:31:18,010 --> 02:31:19,220
versions and we could ever possible no,
that's.

3008
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:21,240
So that's what,
that's implicit in what I'm saying.

3009
02:31:21,241 --> 02:31:26,241
We're imagining that this,
this take off would be this machine 

3010
02:31:26,241 --> 02:31:27,100
create the.
Yeah,

3011
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:29,900
makes recursive improvements to itself 
or to,

3012
02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:31,470
or to new generations.
Yeah.

3013
02:31:31,471 --> 02:31:33,180
So it's just,
it's changing its own code.

3014
02:31:33,181 --> 02:31:37,320
It's learning how to build better 
versions of itself and it just,

3015
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:42,321
it just takes off.
And if you put the one horrible 

3016
02:31:42,321 --> 02:31:45,120
possibility is that this is not 
conscious,

3017
02:31:45,121 --> 02:31:50,121
right?
That there's no good that has come of 

3018
02:31:50,121 --> 02:31:50,121
it.
This,

3019
02:31:50,121 --> 02:31:50,740
this is just blind,
um,

3020
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:55,140
mechanism which still is godlike in its 
power,

3021
02:31:56,520 --> 02:31:58,500
excuse me.
And,

3022
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:01,830
and it could be,
could be antithetical to our survival or

3023
02:32:01,831 --> 02:32:03,700
it could just sort of part Ways with us,
you know,

3024
02:32:05,070 --> 02:32:10,070
that's the mind fuck of all mindfox is 
that we really are just a caterpillar 

3025
02:32:10,070 --> 02:32:14,390
and we're giving birth to this ultimate 
fractal intelligence that's infinite in 

3026
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:14,810
its span.

3027
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:19,260
You could create something within like,
as you said,

3028
02:32:19,261 --> 02:32:20,520
a week,
20,000

3029
02:32:20,521 --> 02:32:25,521
years of,
of human intelligence and the greatest 

3030
02:32:25,521 --> 02:32:27,810
minds in it could do that in a week.
And then a week later,

3031
02:32:27,811 --> 02:32:32,811
another $100,000
more fractal keeps going on and on and 

3032
02:32:32,811 --> 02:32:35,250
on.
It's exponential in its in its reach and

3033
02:32:35,251 --> 02:32:40,251
that we really will be outdated like 
almost instantaneously and sorta kinda 

3034
02:32:40,510 --> 02:32:45,510
crazy that like as you said,
a lot of these guys that are creating 

3035
02:32:45,510 --> 02:32:45,870
these things are on the spectrum and it 
was like,

3036
02:32:45,871 --> 02:32:48,590
what?
What is that from an is is it?

3037
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:51,060
Is it,
is it possible that this,

3038
02:32:51,061 --> 02:32:56,061
that these super intelligent human 
beings that have a lot of them do have 

3039
02:32:56,731 --> 02:33:01,731
the sort of asperger's he way of 
approaching life and a lot of them 

3040
02:33:01,731 --> 02:33:06,021
aren't on the spectrum.
Who did naTure sort of design that in 

3041
02:33:06,021 --> 02:33:09,090
order to make sure that we do create 
these things?

3042
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:11,850
I mean if everything in life,
if life itself,

3043
02:33:12,030 --> 02:33:14,970
everything in life,
we will look at alpha wolves and the way

3044
02:33:14,971 --> 02:33:18,300
caterpillar is interact with their 
environment and bugs and whatever.

3045
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:21,390
All that stuff's natural is human 
behavior.

3046
02:33:21,630 --> 02:33:26,630
Human cognitive thinking is human.
Creativity is all that nature is all 

3047
02:33:26,830 --> 02:33:31,830
that just a part of human beings.
Ultimate curiosity almost inevitably 

3048
02:33:31,830 --> 02:33:34,230
leading to the creation of artificial 
intelligence.

3049
02:33:34,231 --> 02:33:39,231
And was it sort of programmed into the 
system to create something far better 

3050
02:33:39,231 --> 02:33:39,231
than,
than what we are?

3051
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:44,660
Well,
I wouldn't say it's programmed into the 

3052
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:45,000
system or necessarily.
I think you can explain all this just by

3053
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:48,560
everything being pushed from behind,
by it's,

3054
02:33:48,570 --> 02:33:50,190
you know,
we're following our own interests.

3055
02:33:50,191 --> 02:33:52,440
We're trying to survive.
We have all of the,

3056
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:54,090
the,
the,

3057
02:33:54,091 --> 02:33:59,091
uh,
inclinations and abilities that 

3058
02:33:59,091 --> 02:34:00,921
evolution has selected for in us.
And we have an ability to create 

3059
02:34:00,921 --> 02:34:04,641
increasingly powerful technology and the
but the inevitability of this is hard to

3060
02:34:06,481 --> 02:34:10,590
escape when they're really only two 
assumptions.

3061
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:15,710
You,
all you have to assume is that we are 

3062
02:34:15,710 --> 02:34:15,750
going to build better and better 
computers,

3063
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:21,440
which I think you have to assume a part 
from the possibility that we're just 

3064
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:21,910
going to destroy ourselves and,
and lose the,

3065
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:27,000
the ability to do so.
But if We don't destroy ourselves some 

3066
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,401
other way,
we are going to continue to make 

3067
02:34:29,401 --> 02:34:30,460
progress in both hardware and software 
design.

3068
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:36,360
And the only other thing you have to 
assume that there's nothing magical 

3069
02:34:36,610 --> 02:34:41,610
about the wetware we have inside our 
heads as far as information processing 

3070
02:34:41,610 --> 02:34:45,681
is concerned.
And that it's possible to build 

3071
02:34:45,681 --> 02:34:46,030
intelligent machines in silicon,
right?

3072
02:34:46,031 --> 02:34:46,480
So,
and,

3073
02:34:46,510 --> 02:34:48,460
and I don't,
I don't,

3074
02:34:48,461 --> 02:34:53,461
I can't imagine any at this point,
serious scientist fundament mentally 

3075
02:34:54,671 --> 02:34:56,350
down in either of those two assumptions.
I mean,

3076
02:34:56,360 --> 02:35:00,880
there's nobody thinks that there's 
something magical about being,

3077
02:35:00,940 --> 02:35:05,940
you know,
neural material when it comes to 

3078
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:09,900
intelligent processing of information 
that is underlying intelligence and 

3079
02:35:11,380 --> 02:35:12,580
we're just going to keep making 
progress.

3080
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:17,580
So at some point this progress is going 
to birth a generation of computers that 

3081
02:35:18,581 --> 02:35:21,490
is better able to make this sort of 
progress than we are.

3082
02:35:22,990 --> 02:35:24,550
And then it,
then it takes off.

3083
02:35:24,551 --> 02:35:25,330
And so,
and so,

3084
02:35:25,550 --> 02:35:28,420
it's something that the benign version 
of this that some people imagine,

3085
02:35:28,421 --> 02:35:32,710
and this is where the whole singularity 
begins to sound like a religion,

3086
02:35:32,711 --> 02:35:37,711
but there are many people in silicon 
valley imagining that we're going to 

3087
02:35:37,711 --> 02:35:40,410
merge with these machines.
We're going to upload our,

3088
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:45,450
our consciousnesses onto the internet 
eventually and become immortal and just 

3089
02:35:45,461 --> 02:35:48,010
live in sort of the dreamscape of,
of,

3090
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:50,010
you know,
the paradise,

3091
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:53,140
um,
and uh,

3092
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:56,710
that we have engineered into our 
machines.

3093
02:35:56,830 --> 02:35:57,920
And,
uh,

3094
02:35:58,250 --> 02:36:03,250
I mean that,
that vision presupposes a few other 

3095
02:36:03,250 --> 02:36:06,991
things that are more much more far 
fetched than the first two things that 

3096
02:36:06,991 --> 02:36:06,991
I,
first,

3097
02:36:06,991 --> 02:36:08,830
two assumptions I just listed.

3098
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:12,220
one is that before this happens,
we will have,

3099
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:17,250
we will crack the neural code and truly 
understand how to upload the information

3100
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:20,800
in human brain into another medium and 
that you could move,

3101
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:21,880
you know,
consciousness,

3102
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:25,000
mind and consciousness into,
into the internet,

3103
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:27,010
um,
or onto some other,

3104
02:36:27,011 --> 02:36:28,200
um,
uh,

3105
02:36:28,690 --> 02:36:30,110
you know,
he could back yourself up on,

3106
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:32,800
on a hard drive and they're just 
philosophical,

3107
02:36:32,801 --> 02:36:37,801
fundamental.
so philosophical problems about what it 

3108
02:36:37,801 --> 02:36:37,801
would even mean to do that,
right?

3109
02:36:37,801 --> 02:36:37,990
I mean,
in what sense are you surviving?

3110
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:40,510
If you back,
if you copy your brain,

3111
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:43,380
the full contents of your brain,
uh,

3112
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:47,190
successfully into a new medium,
haven't they?

3113
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:52,230
Haven't,
we just doubled you and then when you 

3114
02:36:52,230 --> 02:36:54,000
die,
aren't you just dying every bit as much 

3115
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:54,000
as you would be dying if we hadn't done 
that,

3116
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:54,000
I mean,
that's their problems,

3117
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,300
sort of identity that had come in there 
that are sort of hard to solve.

3118
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:03,780
But um,
now there are people who are looking at 

3119
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:03,780
this as a,
it's very much like we're,

3120
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:08,760
we're building the matrix in some sense 
and we're going to leap into it at the 

3121
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:10,090
opportune moment and it's going to be 
glorious.

3122
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:17,160
That is such a utopian possibility.
Like that's the utopian version x mackey

3123
02:37:17,631 --> 02:37:18,080
now,
right?

3124
02:37:18,081 --> 02:37:20,300
Which comes out.
This isn't an outright now.

3125
02:37:20,301 --> 02:37:20,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

3126
02:37:20,981 --> 02:37:25,981
So I haven't seen it yet,
but I mean this is what we're talking 

3127
02:37:25,981 --> 02:37:28,580
about and that's just,
that is probably the most benign version

3128
02:37:28,581 --> 02:37:30,560
of it in an artificial person that's 
like,

3129
02:37:30,561 --> 02:37:33,380
you can't distinguish it between that 
and a real person,

3130
02:37:33,400 --> 02:37:35,480
but not if you've seen the film.
Well I haven't,

3131
02:37:36,110 --> 02:37:38,450
but our own consciousness is.
I mean,

3132
02:37:38,451 --> 02:37:43,451
it's so archaic in comparison.
If you're talking about something that 

3133
02:37:43,451 --> 02:37:45,260
can exponentially increase in one week,
20,000

3134
02:37:45,261 --> 02:37:47,180
years and then on and on and on from 
there,

3135
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:51,230
why would you want to take your 
consciousness in and download it?

3136
02:37:51,450 --> 02:37:56,450
I mean,
it's like a chicken asking him how his 

3137
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:56,450
day and check out exactly like,
well,

3138
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:59,510
where am I going to go in this new 
world?

3139
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:02,420
And turned it into einstein.
Would it really want to go back to being

3140
02:38:02,421 --> 02:38:07,421
an anti preferred digging in the dirt 
and just dropping my eggs and cutting 

3141
02:38:07,421 --> 02:38:10,280
leaves and what would it do?
I mean,

3142
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:13,370
ultimately this is an escapable it seems
like,

3143
02:38:13,371 --> 02:38:18,371
I mean,
we are our thirst for ingenuity and 

3144
02:38:18,371 --> 02:38:21,611
innovation is just never ever going to 
slow down and in and our ability to do 

3145
02:38:21,611 --> 02:38:23,750
that is never going to slow down either 
unless we,

3146
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:27,370
unless a supervolcano hits or haven't 
they.

3147
02:38:27,510 --> 02:38:32,510
And the other side of this is there's so
many problems that we would want 

3148
02:38:32,510 --> 02:38:33,830
artificial intelligence to solve for us.
I mean,

3149
02:38:33,831 --> 02:38:34,790
just what you think of,
you know,

3150
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:38,420
curing alzheimer's or solving global 
economic problems,

3151
02:38:38,430 --> 02:38:43,430
or how great would it be to have a 
reliably benign superintelligence,

3152
02:38:44,181 --> 02:38:46,600
which literally would be like an oracle,
right?

3153
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:48,120
um,
or,

3154
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:53,260
or a god to help us solve problems that 
we're not smart enough to solve and 

3155
02:38:54,891 --> 02:38:55,790
that,
you know,

3156
02:38:55,850 --> 02:39:00,850
but the prospect of building that and 
keeping it reliably benign or keeping 

3157
02:39:01,430 --> 02:39:04,460
ourselves from going nuts in its 
presence,

3158
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:09,230
that's just a non trivial problem which 
in almost instantaneously recognize that

3159
02:39:09,231 --> 02:39:11,890
part of the problem is us itself,
us that,

3160
02:39:12,020 --> 02:39:12,840
where the problem.

3161
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:14,330
That's one reasonable fear.
Yeah.

3162
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:19,420
Yeah.
And It would also immediately recognize 

3163
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:19,420
like,
hey,

3164
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:22,790
this planet is only got like another 
billion years of reliable sunlight.

3165
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:25,490
Like we've gotta get the fuck out of 
here and propagate the universe.

3166
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:30,850
Well,
there's a great book if you really want 

3167
02:39:30,850 --> 02:39:30,850
to get into this.
There's the book by the philosopher nick

3168
02:39:30,850 --> 02:39:35,201
bostrom a and he actually might've been 
the one who convinced ilan this is such 

3169
02:39:36,681 --> 02:39:37,310
a problem.
And I,

3170
02:39:37,311 --> 02:39:37,910
you know,
I read his,

3171
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:43,000
he was one of the organizers of this 
conference and virtually everyone had 

3172
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:46,571
read his book at the conference.
He wrote a book called 

3173
02:39:46,571 --> 02:39:46,760
superintelligence,
which lays out the whole case.

3174
02:39:46,761 --> 02:39:51,740
And virtually everything that you've 
heard me say on this topic is,

3175
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:53,810
is some version of,
of,

3176
02:39:53,830 --> 02:39:55,910
of a concern that he expresses in that 
book.

3177
02:39:56,600 --> 02:39:59,180
And um,
It's a,

3178
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:04,820
it's a,
it's very interesting because he just 

3179
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:04,820
goes through it,
you know,

3180
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:07,661
it's like 400 pages of systematically 
closing the door to every utopian way,

3181
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:14,130
way this could go right for us.

3182
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,510
And he just says like,
yeah,

3183
02:40:15,511 --> 02:40:19,080
well know here are the things you're not
foreseen about how,

3184
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:21,150
you know,
even a,

3185
02:40:21,151 --> 02:40:26,151
um,
let me just have to anticipate 

3186
02:40:26,151 --> 02:40:26,151
absolutely everything.
So if,

3187
02:40:26,151 --> 02:40:30,330
if,
if you're trying to create a machine 

3188
02:40:30,330 --> 02:40:30,330
that,
that is going to read,

3189
02:40:30,330 --> 02:40:31,770
you know,
blocks spam,

3190
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:37,040
right?
You need to create a machine that will 

3191
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:37,950
not as a strategy for reducing spam,
just kill people.

3192
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:38,570
Right?
Mean,

3193
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:40,750
that's a way to reduce spam.
And,

3194
02:40:40,850 --> 02:40:42,180
but it's like,
that's the only way.

3195
02:40:42,181 --> 02:40:47,181
Yeah.
It's like common sense things that you 

3196
02:40:47,181 --> 02:40:49,641
can't,
you can't and you can't assume common 

3197
02:40:49,641 --> 02:40:49,920
sense in a super intelligent machine 
unless you,

3198
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:54,870
unless you have engineered it into the 
architecture or you have,

3199
02:40:55,530 --> 02:41:00,530
you have taught it,
you've built it to emulate your 

3200
02:41:00,530 --> 02:41:04,400
strategies where they,
where you would be able to build a 

3201
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:08,130
machine where it would not only would 
not merely emulate current human values,

3202
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:13,800
it would seek to,
to be ultimately you want a,

3203
02:41:13,890 --> 02:41:14,830
you want a,
a,

3204
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:19,470
a machine that instantiates the values 
that we should have.

3205
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:24,860
You know that.
Not that we necessarily do at any 

3206
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:24,860
moment.
And what was interesting,

3207
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:28,311
one thing that's interesting to me in 
thinking about this is that the moment 

3208
02:41:28,550 --> 02:41:30,360
you think about building a machine like 
this,

3209
02:41:30,990 --> 02:41:34,590
you realize that you have to solve some 
fundamental philosophical problems.

3210
02:41:34,591 --> 02:41:39,591
You can't pretend that that everyone,
everyone has this equivalently valuable 

3211
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:41,610
values,
right?

3212
02:41:41,611 --> 02:41:44,400
You can't because you have to decide 
what to engineer into this thing.

3213
02:41:44,401 --> 02:41:49,401
So do you want to engineer the values of
jihadists and is submitted to the 

3214
02:41:50,371 --> 02:41:51,910
taliban,
get a vote on what,

3215
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:54,480
how we should design the values of this 
thing?

3216
02:41:54,490 --> 02:41:55,680
Well,
I think it's Pretty,

3217
02:41:55,681 --> 02:41:58,870
obviously the answer to that is no.
Um,

3218
02:41:59,370 --> 02:42:04,370
but then you have to cut through 
basically every other moral quandary we 

3219
02:42:04,370 --> 02:42:04,370
have,
we,

3220
02:42:04,370 --> 02:42:08,670
because this thing is going to be acting
on the basis of a values,

3221
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:12,690
but initially wouldn't it be even if 
it's independent and autonomous,

3222
02:42:12,930 --> 02:42:17,930
it's gonna automatically realize that a 
lot of our ideas are based on our own 

3223
02:42:17,930 --> 02:42:21,771
biological needs and that the,
a lot of those are unnecessary for it or

3224
02:42:22,270 --> 02:42:24,780
yet,
but we will be building it.

3225
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:29,840
I mean if we're,
if we're saying we're going to build it 

3226
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,260
not to be merely self interested,
we're going to be,

3227
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:33,900
we're going to build it to conserve our 
interests.

3228
02:42:33,930 --> 02:42:37,860
Whatever those deepest interests are 
ultimately utopian though.

3229
02:42:37,861 --> 02:42:41,920
I mean because otherwise we're building,
you know,

3230
02:42:42,030 --> 02:42:44,860
satan and we're building,
which is what ilan must say.

3231
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:46,890
Somebody in the,
in.

3232
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:51,900
Yeah.
I mean we're building something that's 

3233
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:51,900
just going to readjust.
We're building a wrecking ball and we're

3234
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:53,910
going to swing it out away from the 
planet and watch it hurdle back.

3235
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:58,790
So essentially the unabomber was right.
Have you ever seen people,

3236
02:42:59,030 --> 02:43:04,030
a few people have done this with his tax
because there are sections of his texts 

3237
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:07,530
that can read totally irrational and 
people are people.

3238
02:43:07,531 --> 02:43:12,531
Occasionally we'll put a section there 
and then it's not until you turn the 

3239
02:43:12,531 --> 02:43:12,531
page and have already agreed

3240
02:43:12,531 --> 02:43:13,940
with it that you see who wrote it.
UM,

3241
02:43:15,070 --> 02:43:16,130
but,
uh,

3242
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,460
yeah.
Well,

3243
02:43:17,690 --> 02:43:18,040
yeah,
it's,

3244
02:43:18,050 --> 02:43:20,920
it's,
it's interesting to see that were.

3245
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:25,360
We are kind of headed toward some kind 
of precipice here.

3246
02:43:25,390 --> 02:43:30,390
Do you know how he lost his mind?
Do you know the story about ted 

3247
02:43:30,390 --> 02:43:30,520
kaczynski?
I don't know.

3248
02:43:30,580 --> 02:43:34,900
He was part of the harvard lsd studies.
They dose the shit out of that dude.

3249
02:43:34,990 --> 02:43:35,980
Yeah,
they dosed him.

3250
02:43:36,130 --> 02:43:41,130
He went to berkeley.
I started teaching and saved Up all his 

3251
02:43:41,130 --> 02:43:42,070
money from teaching and went to the 
woods and started blowing up people that

3252
02:43:42,071 --> 02:43:43,860
were involved in technology.
Yeah,

3253
02:43:43,870 --> 02:43:46,600
there's a,
there's a documentary called the net and

3254
02:43:46,910 --> 02:43:50,440
I believe it's from Germany.
I believe it was a german documentary,

3255
02:43:50,441 --> 02:43:55,441
but it's very secretive,
like who was and was not involved in 

3256
02:43:55,441 --> 02:44:00,211
those harvard lsd studies.
What people on the other side of those 

3257
02:44:00,211 --> 02:44:04,351
studies,
and I knew richard alpert who became us 

3258
02:44:04,351 --> 02:44:06,790
but didn't kill everybody,
didn't break everybody's brain.

3259
02:44:06,850 --> 02:44:07,150
No,
no,

3260
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:10,690
but I mean he might've had a vision that
he chased down,

3261
02:44:11,080 --> 02:44:15,910
you know,
add to the final point and he recognized

3262
02:44:15,911 --> 02:44:18,200
from his experiences like,
whoa,

3263
02:44:18,201 --> 02:44:20,590
if we keep going,
this is inevitable.

3264
02:44:20,591 --> 02:44:22,940
And became obsessed wiTh it.
Obviously you know,

3265
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:24,070
you will,
you're dealing.

3266
02:44:24,370 --> 02:44:29,370
One of the things that people try to 
connect his various drugs with 

3267
02:44:29,370 --> 02:44:34,020
schizophrenia and mental illnesses and 
most of those have not been able to 

3268
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:38,701
stick because there's a certain 
percentage of people that will 

3269
02:44:38,701 --> 02:44:41,761
inevitably have issues and if those are 
the percentage of people that have 

3270
02:44:42,611 --> 02:44:47,611
issues with schizophrenia or various 
mental illnesses are almost mirrored by 

3271
02:44:47,611 --> 02:44:49,810
the percentage of people who do 
psychedelic drugs,

3272
02:44:49,811 --> 02:44:53,650
various psychoactive drugs and develop 
these mental issue.

3273
02:44:53,651 --> 02:44:57,640
So it might not be the cause,
but it is some,

3274
02:44:57,700 --> 02:45:02,700
it's a concern.
And if you get a guy who may have a 

3275
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:04,720
propensity for mental illness and you 
dose the shit out of him with lsd,

3276
02:45:04,990 --> 02:45:05,170
yeah.

3277
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:07,330
Might get a ted kaczynski.
No,

3278
02:45:07,331 --> 02:45:12,331
I think there are some people who 
certainly shouldn't take any drugs there

3279
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:14,750
and you know,
I'd be,

3280
02:45:14,751 --> 02:45:19,000
I've had bad experiences on,
on a variety of psychedelics and as well

3281
02:45:19,001 --> 02:45:24,001
as good ones obviously,
but the bad experiences I could see in 

3282
02:45:24,251 --> 02:45:29,251
the wrong mind affecting you permanently
in a way that it's not good for you or 

3283
02:45:29,251 --> 02:45:31,030
anyone else you can go off the road.
I've,

3284
02:45:31,050 --> 02:45:32,890
I went off the rails for a couple of 
weeks once,

3285
02:45:33,270 --> 02:45:35,740
not really off the rails.
I was totally functional.

3286
02:45:35,741 --> 02:45:38,560
Most people probably didn't even know 
that I was off the rails,

3287
02:45:39,250 --> 02:45:40,270
but uh,
my,

3288
02:45:40,660 --> 02:45:44,680
the way I describe it is that my grip on
reality had gotten very slippery.

3289
02:45:45,150 --> 02:45:50,150
Like I was kinda hanging on,
like ever done chin ups with sweaty 

3290
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:50,150
hands.
Uh,

3291
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:50,150
yeah.
Yeah.

3292
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:53,590
I'm not exactly sure how many you can 
get on before your hands give out,

3293
02:45:53,810 --> 02:45:55,690
you know,
and that's kind of how I felt.

3294
02:45:55,690 --> 02:46:00,010
I didn't feel like I had a chalk on my 
hands and wrists traps.

3295
02:46:00,011 --> 02:46:02,710
I felt like I had a slippery grip on 
reality.

3296
02:46:03,100 --> 02:46:07,600
Thankfully within a couple of weeks it 
came back to felt normal,

3297
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:10,060
but especially the first days 
afterwards,

3298
02:46:10,090 --> 02:46:12,620
she's very intense psychedelic 
experience.

3299
02:46:12,621 --> 02:46:17,621
That was like as boundary dissolving as 
you can get there maybe might be like an

3300
02:46:19,011 --> 02:46:24,011
argument that there's probably several 
versions of of each person based on your

3301
02:46:24,291 --> 02:46:26,060
reactions to whatever experiences you 
have,

3302
02:46:26,061 --> 02:46:28,640
but that might've been version two 
point.

3303
02:46:28,641 --> 02:46:29,180
Oh,
of me.

3304
02:46:29,240 --> 02:46:31,250
Like after that,
like I'm a different person.

3305
02:46:31,310 --> 02:46:36,310
I became a different person because of 
the and that could easily be what 

3306
02:46:36,310 --> 02:46:38,140
happened to poor old ted.
It like,

3307
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:39,050
yeah,
like you said,

3308
02:46:39,051 --> 02:46:42,230
like some of his,
his assertions,

3309
02:46:42,570 --> 02:46:44,810
like if you look at the direction that 
technology is headed,

3310
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:47,810
I mean obviously he was fucking batshit 
crazy,

3311
02:46:48,110 --> 02:46:51,440
but he said some things that weren't 
batshit crazy.

3312
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:53,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

3313
02:46:53,360 --> 02:46:55,160
Well that's the thing.
So if we can make a meme,

3314
02:46:55,161 --> 02:46:57,220
if you could just say ted kaczynski was 
right,

3315
02:46:57,250 --> 02:46:58,670
right.
We'll just put that in quotes.

3316
02:46:58,790 --> 02:47:00,680
Put.
Put that on twitter.

3317
02:47:01,060 --> 02:47:06,060
His boils down to today is,
is putting a photo of you with a quote 

3318
02:47:07,041 --> 02:47:12,041
taken completely out of context and 
everybody sort of shits on it or agrees 

3319
02:47:12,381 --> 02:47:16,480
or disagrees.
It is a and fun on,

3320
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:19,540
you know,
I think it's you're,

3321
02:47:19,541 --> 02:47:21,180
you're doing well.
if you just,

3322
02:47:21,220 --> 02:47:26,220
if you never knowingly do that.
I mean if you never knowingly 

3323
02:47:26,220 --> 02:47:30,310
misrepresent your opponent,
then you can get into Just knock down,

3324
02:47:30,311 --> 02:47:31,940
drag out arguments about anything,
right?

3325
02:47:31,990 --> 02:47:36,370
and then it's all fine,
but as long as you're interacting with a

3326
02:47:36,371 --> 02:47:41,371
person's actual views,
then condemn those views and criticize 

3327
02:47:41,371 --> 02:47:41,980
those views to the to to whatever 
degree.

3328
02:47:41,981 --> 02:47:46,981
But if you're,
if part of your proJect or the entirety 

3329
02:47:46,981 --> 02:47:50,281
of your project is simply knowingly 
sliming them with a misrepresentation of

3330
02:47:50,681 --> 02:47:53,490
their views because you can get away 
with it because you know [inaudible],

3331
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:55,030
you know their,
their views are either.

3332
02:47:55,031 --> 02:48:00,031
So I'm hard to understand for most 
people or there's people aren't going to

3333
02:48:01,601 --> 02:48:02,840
take the time to do it.
That

3334
02:48:04,230 --> 02:48:08,730
intellectually defaming people well.
It's also that there's a desire to win.

3335
02:48:09,090 --> 02:48:14,090
A lot of people have that.
They apply to debates and it makes them 

3336
02:48:14,090 --> 02:48:18,681
intellectually dishonest because they 
don't want to agree that someone that 

3337
02:48:18,681 --> 02:48:22,020
they might have a disagreement with may 
have a point or two,

3338
02:48:22,050 --> 02:48:26,010
you mean you might disagree with the 
entirety of what they're saying,

3339
02:48:26,310 --> 02:48:31,310
but somewhere along the line you might,
it might be possible that you could see 

3340
02:48:31,310 --> 02:48:33,300
where they're coming from even if you 
don't agree,

3341
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:34,560
but you,
it just,

3342
02:48:34,630 --> 02:48:37,920
it throws your argument into a bad 
position.

3343
02:48:37,921 --> 02:48:38,760
So you abandoned it.

3344
02:48:39,690 --> 02:48:44,690
And the thing is that the merit of an 
argument has no relationship to it 

3345
02:48:44,690 --> 02:48:44,970
source.
Really.

3346
02:48:44,990 --> 02:48:49,560
It's like either the argument succeeds 
or fails based on the,

3347
02:48:49,790 --> 02:48:54,790
the structure of the argument and it's 
connection to evidence or it doesn't.

3348
02:48:55,380 --> 02:48:57,210
Right.
And it doesn't matter if it was hitler's

3349
02:48:57,211 --> 02:48:59,430
argument for the destruction of the jews
or,

3350
02:48:59,431 --> 02:49:04,431
or you know,
ted kaczynski said something true about 

3351
02:49:05,161 --> 02:49:10,161
the progress of technology.
It's whether it's true or not about the 

3352
02:49:10,161 --> 02:49:10,161
progress,
progress of technology.

3353
02:49:10,161 --> 02:49:15,031
It has nothing to do with the source,
but people imagine that you can.

3354
02:49:15,151 --> 02:49:20,151
If you don't like the source,
there's no burden to actually address 

3355
02:49:20,151 --> 02:49:24,291
the arguments.
And if you don't like the arguments as 

3356
02:49:24,291 --> 02:49:25,350
successful rejoinder is just to trash 
the source,

3357
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:27,000
right?
That's neither of those are true.

3358
02:49:27,170 --> 02:49:30,150
If you want to deal with the,
the,

3359
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:31,710
if you want to get at what's true in the
world,

3360
02:49:31,711 --> 02:49:36,711
you have to deal with arguments on their
merits and you have to deal with 

3361
02:49:36,711 --> 02:49:37,470
evidence and,
and it doesn't matter if the evidence is

3362
02:49:37,471 --> 02:49:41,160
coming from a thoroughly obnoxious 
source,

3363
02:49:41,190 --> 02:49:43,800
it's not sufficient to say,
well,

3364
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:45,150
I,
you know,

3365
02:49:45,151 --> 02:49:49,130
I hate the source or as shorthand,
we'll all have to pr to,

3366
02:49:49,230 --> 02:49:51,570
to privilege our attention and time.

3367
02:49:51,570 --> 02:49:52,350
So if,
if you know,

3368
02:49:52,351 --> 02:49:55,660
a source is disreputable at a certain 
point,

3369
02:49:55,750 --> 02:49:57,270
you know,
you can just decide,

3370
02:49:57,271 --> 02:49:59,250
well,
I don't need to hear it from this person

3371
02:49:59,251 --> 02:50:02,730
because I know this person doesn't 
understand what he's saying and his lied

3372
02:50:02,731 --> 02:50:07,731
in the past.
So I'll wait to hear it from somebody 

3373
02:50:07,731 --> 02:50:07,731
else.
Um,

3374
02:50:07,731 --> 02:50:11,990
so yeah,
it's not that the source doesn't matter 

3375
02:50:11,990 --> 02:50:12,090
at all,
but you're not actually addressing truth

3376
02:50:12,091 --> 02:50:15,840
claims if you're just disparaging the 
source of those claims.

3377
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:18,100
Um,
we don't have much time left.

3378
02:50:18,101 --> 02:50:20,680
We have less than 10 minutes.
Is there anything else you'd want to get

3379
02:50:20,681 --> 02:50:21,070
into?

3380
02:50:23,790 --> 02:50:26,620
And then we had the only other thing on 
this list,

3381
02:50:26,621 --> 02:50:30,280
which is just too big for 10 minutes and
we're going to get in trouble,

3382
02:50:30,281 --> 02:50:33,850
is people,
lot of people hit us with cops,

3383
02:50:33,851 --> 02:50:35,170
baltimore,
selfdefence,

3384
02:50:35,320 --> 02:50:37,420
violence,
weapons,

3385
02:50:37,480 --> 02:50:38,740
all of that stuff.

3386
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,090
Yeah.
Um,

3387
02:50:40,350 --> 02:50:41,760
that's a big one.
That's an hour.

3388
02:50:41,820 --> 02:50:42,670
That's.
Yeah,

3389
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:44,460
at least.
Yeah.

3390
02:50:44,461 --> 02:50:49,461
And it's also,
it's also we don't need to talk about 

3391
02:50:49,461 --> 02:50:51,210
it.
Once artificial intelligence kicks in,

3392
02:50:51,211 --> 02:50:52,510
we're not going to have crime anymore.
Yeah,

3393
02:50:52,760 --> 02:50:55,980
we've pretty much cured it all with the 
final hour.

3394
02:50:56,340 --> 02:51:01,340
The artificial intelligence conversation
sort of trumps the whole thing because 

3395
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:05,031
it was islam is not going to important 
when there's robots that can read your 

3396
02:51:05,031 --> 02:51:05,031
brain.
I mean,

3397
02:51:05,031 --> 02:51:08,550
we're going to not need people anymore.
So you don't need religion.

3398
02:51:08,551 --> 02:51:11,940
You don't need lies.
Charlie updos completely irrelevant.

3399
02:51:11,941 --> 02:51:15,240
It will be a footnote in history.
It'll be like there were monkeys.

3400
02:51:15,241 --> 02:51:20,241
They through their shit.
And then there were robots that can 

3401
02:51:20,241 --> 02:51:22,431
think for themselves and that was it.
But forget about all that other 

3402
02:51:22,431 --> 02:51:22,460
building,
the eiffel tower and the.

3403
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:27,710
And what,
what's scary about this thing is that 

3404
02:51:27,710 --> 02:51:27,710
it's,
it's very hard to.

3405
02:51:27,710 --> 02:51:28,090
I mean,
so I read the book,

3406
02:51:28,091 --> 02:51:29,700
I went to the conference,
I've written about this,

3407
02:51:29,710 --> 02:51:34,710
I've spoken about this,
I hang out with people who are worried 

3408
02:51:34,710 --> 02:51:37,891
about this and it's actually still hard 
to keep this concern and view it just,

3409
02:51:39,041 --> 02:51:42,790
it does feel like the moment you spend 
10 minutes not thinking about it,

3410
02:51:43,330 --> 02:51:45,880
to start thinking about it again,
makes you feel like,

3411
02:51:46,270 --> 02:51:48,860
um,
maybe that's just all crazy bullshit,

3412
02:51:48,890 --> 02:51:52,190
but what am I really going to be a super
intelligent machine that's going to take

3413
02:51:52,210 --> 02:51:54,200
you to swallow the world?
RigHt?

3414
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:56,150
Listen to that.
The devil's greatest trick.

3415
02:51:56,810 --> 02:51:59,510
Yeah.
Right now with the impressionists,

3416
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:01,290
the devil's greatest,
the,

3417
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:03,140
it doesn't make sense.
Yeah.

3418
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:05,940
But it's in.
This is on you.

3419
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:07,140
Unlike other,
I mean,

3420
02:52:07,810 --> 02:52:12,810
other things have this character like 
it's hard to really worry about climate 

3421
02:52:12,810 --> 02:52:13,780
change because it's an abstraction.
I mean,

3422
02:52:13,781 --> 02:52:18,781
it's hot out there today,
but how much hotter is it than it used 

3423
02:52:18,781 --> 02:52:18,781
to be?
And,

3424
02:52:18,781 --> 02:52:18,781
you know,
um,

3425
02:52:18,781 --> 02:52:21,970
or you know,
during the cold war we knew that we had,

3426
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:25,030
we still have these icbm is pointed in 
all the wrong directions,

3427
02:52:25,031 --> 02:52:27,030
but um,
you know,

3428
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:31,790
we're living under the continuous threat
of something going wrong and,

3429
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:35,000
and annihilating the better part of 
humanity and it's,

3430
02:52:35,010 --> 02:52:40,010
he had his heart.
It's much easier to worry about other 

3431
02:52:40,010 --> 02:52:41,050
far more easier to worry about twitter 
than it is to worry about that.

3432
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:46,500
But this thing is so kind of lampoon 
bubble and it's,

3433
02:52:47,050 --> 02:52:52,050
I mean,
this is kind of a goofy notion which 

3434
02:52:52,050 --> 02:52:54,151
seems just too strange to even be the 
substance of good credible fiction.

3435
02:52:55,270 --> 02:52:59,860
And yet when you look at the assumptions
you need to get on the train,

3436
02:53:00,730 --> 02:53:04,060
there's only two and they're not.
I mean,

3437
02:53:04,070 --> 02:53:04,560
and,
and they're.

3438
02:53:04,590 --> 02:53:08,020
And they're very hard to doubt the truth
of,

3439
02:53:08,260 --> 02:53:09,970
again,
we just have to keep making progress.

3440
02:53:10,570 --> 02:53:15,570
And there's nothing magical about 
biological material in terms of an 

3441
02:53:15,570 --> 02:53:20,260
intelligent system.
And by the time it becomes a threat to 

3442
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:22,750
everyone,
by the time we recognize it as a threat,

3443
02:53:23,380 --> 02:53:26,410
ideally it will be too late.
Well,

3444
02:53:26,510 --> 02:53:31,510
that's.
People have different timings of the 

3445
02:53:31,510 --> 02:53:31,510
tate where they call the takeoff,
you know,

3446
02:53:31,510 --> 02:53:32,740
whether it's a hard take off or 
something more gradual,

3447
02:53:32,741 --> 02:53:35,020
but um,
yeah,

3448
02:53:35,021 --> 02:53:35,850
there's a,
a,

3449
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:41,440
it's the kind of thing that could happen
in secret and all of a sudden things are

3450
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:45,280
different in a way that no one 
understands.

3451
02:53:45,281 --> 02:53:50,281
And you can also make this argument that
if you look at all the issues that we 

3452
02:53:50,281 --> 02:53:53,851
have in this world,
that so many of them are almost 

3453
02:53:53,851 --> 02:53:53,851
unfixable without this.

3454
02:53:53,851 --> 02:53:54,280
Yeah.
Again,

3455
02:53:54,281 --> 02:53:56,620
that's what I,
that's what I said is the other side.

3456
02:53:56,740 --> 02:53:58,120
I said,
I think in my blog post,

3457
02:53:58,121 --> 02:54:03,121
the only thing scarier than the 
development of strong artificial 

3458
02:54:03,121 --> 02:54:05,350
artificial intelligence is not 
developing it because we need,

3459
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:09,440
we need that.
We have problems for which we need to.

3460
02:54:09,490 --> 02:54:12,130
Intelligence is our only asset 
ultimately.

3461
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:13,230
You know what I mean?
It's everything.

3462
02:54:13,250 --> 02:54:14,620
It's given us everything good.
Right?

3463
02:54:14,621 --> 02:54:16,750
And why should we accept our limited 
biological,

3464
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:19,960
biological intelligence?
We can come up with something infinitely

3465
02:54:19,961 --> 02:54:23,080
more intelligent and it's a progress in 
this,

3466
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:26,830
in this area.
It seems almost an intrinsic good.

3467
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:28,630
I mean,
jUst because we want to,

3468
02:54:28,660 --> 02:54:31,870
we want to be able to whatever you want,
clean the ocean,

3469
02:54:31,990 --> 02:54:36,990
you want to be able to solve problems 
and you want to be able to anticipate 

3470
02:54:36,990 --> 02:54:36,990
the new,
the,

3471
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:42,160
the negative consequences of your doing 
good things and mitigate those.

3472
02:54:42,581 --> 02:54:47,581
And intelligence is just,
it's the thing you used to do that puts 

3473
02:54:47,581 --> 02:54:49,450
on their freaK.
Everybody out.

3474
02:54:50,020 --> 02:54:52,360
Sam Harris out blog.
You blog,

3475

and podcast.
Sam harris on twitter.

3477
02:54:57,980 --> 02:54:58,840
Uh,
sam harris.

3478
02:54:58,841 --> 02:55:00,540
Org without twitter.
Yeah.

3479
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:02,440
Thanks man.
I appreciate it.

3480
02:55:02,500 --> 02:55:03,620
Always a good time.
Lots of fun.

3481
02:55:03,650 --> 02:55:04,170
Yeah.
All right.

3482
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:09,400
Much love my friends.
We will be back on friday with rich roll

3483
02:55:09,860 --> 02:55:11,320
until then.
See soon.

3484
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:11,870
Bye.
Bye.

3485
02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:30,910
Exactly.
Never met him,

3486
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:31,010
but.
