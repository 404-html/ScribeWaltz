1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,910
I don't want to be a first adopter.
Was fucking thing's gonna.

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,510
Fall apart.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,310
Boom.
Joe Diaz end with live.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,590
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,840
Did you really go out and buy one of 
those iphones last night?

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,580
Did you order?
No,

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,480
red band called me and he goes,
are you going to get.

8
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,340
Because I asked them a few.
We call everybody.

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,660
I went to get the out,
you know,

10
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't know anything about computers,
so I call Redman.

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,900
He's my computer guy.
So I went to get the IPAD,

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,970
the big one,
the 19.

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,790
And I asked the lady because my phone's 
fucked up already because just wait for 

14
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,670
the eight.
So I called red band about a month ago.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,990
He goes,
wait,

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,180
and last night he called out of the 
blue.

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,710
He goes,
you got to get online at midnight.

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,520
And I didn't get it like an asshole.
I just forgot my coat.

19
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,830
I got through,
I got through the second click,

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,560
click,
click,

21
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,900
boom.
A water already awarded the silver,

22
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,740
black,
Bam,

23
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,460
Bam,
Bam.

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,350
And then at the end that had to get the 
fucking code for I.

25
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,350
I turned a handful.
I woke my wife up in the middle of the 

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,541
night,
so get the fuck out of here because she 

27
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,260
really did tell him to get the fuck out 
of here.

28
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,990
You fucking crazy waking me up at 12.
15 stupid fucking phone is going to be 

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,610
lines around the block and those apple 
stores.

30
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:12,420
It's.
It's crazy.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,480
It's like those sneaker lines.
When you see those people out to buy 

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,480
sneakers,

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,370
supreme lines.
Now supreme has got a whole thing with.

34
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,890
Can they wait in line for three or four 
days now and almost almost weekly,

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,410
but I'll show you the shit.
You're probably going to freak out when 

36
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,921
I show you what they're waiting.
Please do a shovel's bricks with just 

37
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,340
the word supreme written on it.
Shovels and bricks t shirts are the main

38
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,560
thing.
Exactly.

39
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,480
It's a brand.
It's a street wear brand

40
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,770
and people wait in line for bricks.
Fucking kids today.

41
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,900
This is what happens when kids don't go 
outside.

42
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,300
They don't play,
don't play sports,

43
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:52,700
and they stay at home.
They just play video games.

44
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:54,740
Nancy Reagan's fault with the.
Just say no,

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,620
he's kids smoked dope.
They see life for what it is.

46
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:02,621
You know what I'm saying?
I'm going to wait in line for an hour 

47
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:03,200
for fucking break liquors.
This supreme crowbar,

48
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,620
they sell it

49
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,880
boss or the crowbar.
I would just have like the name supreme 

50
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:08,880
on it.
Okay,

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,690
well who's using that?
No one uses it.

52
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:12,210
It's like a.
it's real.

53
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,280
You have to look into the brand a little
bit to understand it,

54
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:16,340
but it's sort of part of the joke 
almost.

55
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,350
They're making parody of the craziness 
of it all by just throwing their brand 

56
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,790
name on stuff and people are buying into
it.

57
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,470
Go back to the page.

58
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,730
So supreme what the top 10 don wearable 
supreme products.

59
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,870
Jesus Christ,
they have fire extinguishers joke,

60
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,530
but some of the clothes are cool nun 
chucks.

61
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,870
It just depends.
I mean you got to be really into it and 

62
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:42,870
some people are really into,
like I said,

63
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,701
they wait in line for days.
A lot of them though are making money 

64
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,460
off of it because they can buy it for 40
or 50 bucks and flip it for $200.

65
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,980
I don't understand like why is everybody
buying limited,

66
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:55,100
limited quantities and whatnot,
but what is the big deal about supreme.

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,370
Okay.

68
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,460
Cut.
You have to look into the history of.

69
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,090
There's some youtube videos.
You can look up.

70
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,040
You sound

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,510
like Eddie Bravo,
gotta look into it.

72
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,860
It's really hard to explain and I like 
can't even take me a half an hour to get

73
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,861
into it.
I don't want to hijack the show about 

74
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:10,861
supreme right now.
So I just,

75
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:10,960
I never,
I wasn't aware of this.

76
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,020
I thought it was just like a tee shirt.
It's where it's dark and you.

77
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,570
So Josh Martin where he spends a lot of 
money.

78
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
He's a fool.
Well,

79
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,940
he wears those Goddamn yeezys that you 
were to spend that much money.

80
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,740
I'm getting for retail.
I wouldn't buy them otherwise.

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,290
Josh Martin is like into every trendy 
thing.

82
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,280
Everything that comes out.
He's like way ahead of the curve.

83
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,120
The supreme target on the.
Exactly.

84
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:32,560
Exactly.
Jesus Christ.

85
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,390
Joey,
I don't give a fuck.

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,060
I didn't know about this.
You buy a hammer says supreme on it.

87
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,610
The fact they sell nunchucks.
It's hilarious.

88
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,170
Supreme nunchucks.
Did we wait on line when we were kids?

89
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,750
Not for anything.
Like last night I was watching 

90
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,851
something,
the real story about the godfather and 

91
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:51,550
they showed when they released the 
Godfather,

92
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,030
but New York and that will lines for the
movies.

93
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:57,880
The movies.
I'm sure I waited in line to go see star

94
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,590
wars,
but not in three fucking days.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,730
Camped out the night before?
No,

96
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,810
not for a hammer.
What did they camp out for back then?

97
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,320
It kept that for something really.
Like the first I ever saw it was a 

98
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,810
iphones.
When the first iphone were out,

99
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,080
I remember going to the mall and going,
what in the fuck am I seeing?

100
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,160
And there was a giant line outside the 
apple store and this was like one.

101
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,480
One of the first iphone was coming out 
and I was like,

102
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,040
why are you waiting for a phone?
You don't have a phone already.

103
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,780
Is this the only way to get the phone?

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,370
I was.
It was all so confusing,

105
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,240
but it was a thing where people would 
wait in line and then they would look at

106
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:39,241
each other and I remember when.
I remember when they were waiting in 

107
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:41,650
line for Harry Potter when Harry Potter 
was coming out and people would drive by

108
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:44,290
and they were yelling out,
dumbledore dies at the end.

109
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,350
They're yelling out all these different 
spoilers.

110
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,380
All I typed in was waiting in line for 
it in Google and the only things that 

111
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,860
come up or iphone supreme and iphone 
eight or gas.

112
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,270
Yeah,
gas.

113
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,750
We waited in line with the flags.
Red,

114
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,910
green or yellow flag.
What was that?

115
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,430
Uh,
there was like in the mid seventies 

116
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,911
there was a gas shortage.
So green meant that you got gas if you 

117
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,980
have an odd number,
like if you license play them,

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,410
the nod.
Yellow was even and then red was,

119
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,580
was shut down bitch.

120
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,980
Oh yeah,
that's right.

121
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,830
But that they had the flags 73 to 75 
maybe something like that.

122
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,800
I don't know the exact dates.
Then they had a weird line.

123
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,780
Studio.
Fifty four had a huge one,

124
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,610
but you got picked studio 54.
The dance club studio.

125
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,640
50 floor was on fire.
You showed up.

126
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,900
You didn't guarantee to get it.
You got picked right the way they do now

127
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,670
in Hollywood,
like they pick hot chicks,

128
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,960
right?
So they pick hot chicks.

129
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,310
What was the thing we were talking about
when they.

130
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,460
They won't let a guy in without a check 
something.

131
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,470
Yeah.
Some be to go out and clubs and they'd 

132
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,440
never would let guys in without chicks.
So if you walk into a club with three 

133
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,100
guys that don't want you,
they want

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,630
the chicks in there first.
Yeah.

135
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,640
Well the last thing you want is a 
sausage fest.

136
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,110
Look at all those dudes trying to get 
in.

137
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,990
Looking to luminous.
That was inside,

138
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,650
but outside that be aligned.
The people or that could be at.

139
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,500
No,
that's outside.

140
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,270
That's outside.
What?

141
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,430
A zoo.
Just to try to get in.

142
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,430
Just to try to get here.
What was the big deal about studio 54?

143
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,840
You could snort coke,
dance.

144
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,020
Get Your Dick sucked and get your shoes 
shined all at the same place and be home

145
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,820
by six.
It was a.

146
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,160
You know what I mean?
Everybody with their like that.

147
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,670
Andy Warhol,
Andy Warhol,

148
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,740
but was the girl.
Look at her.

149
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,230
She's got a beer bottle in her mouth,
you know,

150
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,430
champagne.
Champagne.

151
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,570
Yeah.
It's pretty hard.

152
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,560
Fucking black Sabbath four.
Look at Mick Jagger's wife there.

153
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:46,220
So with the Andy Warhol looking lives 
immediately behind them.

154
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,520
Wow.
So it was just like the place to be.

155
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,710
It was the place to be.
You could go crazy.

156
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,020
Strange.
Strange Times,

157
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,570
Huh?
But here's the beauty of it.

158
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:01,010
They have a station like serious and 
it's called studio 54.

159
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,090
You could just put it on Sunday nights.
They do a podcast and what they do is 

160
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,651
they interview people that actually used
to go there or work there and I never 

161
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:12,240
tell you something,
Joe.

162
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,340
They had a dentist on about a year ago 
and his wife that it was crazy listening

163
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,980
to this interview about what their life 
was.

164
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,920
They were professional dentists making 
money in New York.

165
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,950
They stayed out till five,
six every night,

166
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,500
but went home,
took the kids to school,

167
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,260
went back home,
took a nap to one,

168
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,750
got up,
went to the dental office work though 

169
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:34,750
five,
went home,

170
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,840
took another nap,
fed the kids and at 9:00

171
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,520
they brought him.

172
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,890
Bring the kids downstairs so they're 
moms and they do it all over again.

173
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Five nights a week over and over,
and the lady was saying that until years

174
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,750
later lives in Middle East.
I was a publicist.

175
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,570
She goes,
she didn't know I was a dentist.

176
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,200
They just saw you in there.
Your trust funders,

177
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:59,201
you know,
that's all the people who could do that 

178
00:07:59,201 --> 00:07:59,270
type of shit.
Blow to Lola was a night.

179
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:04,271
You can put it out.
They even had an interview about when 

180
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:04,520
Bob Hope went to studio 54.
Bob Hope,

181
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,050
Bob Hope Walkman.
The studio that.

182
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,430
No,
what the fuck.

183
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,730
He was going to,
what?

184
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:13,731
Where he was going to walk into.
He went out to the middle of the floor 

185
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,250
and started dancing and these chicks got
together and started tying hope up,

186
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,420
tying them around like an Indian.
He's just standing there like laughing 

187
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,420
Bob hope style.
Then it's like,

188
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,030
it's just a fucking joke.

189
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,270
They just left them there and then just 
tighten them up and left him there.

190
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,450
Tons of stories like that,
you know,

191
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,490
just.
But then it moved up,

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,340
but you got picked to go in there.
How did it move on,

193
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,520
like imagine how weird it must have been
when it finally the door shut and that 

194
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,560
was it.
The people were.

195
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,090
It was their whole life.
For years,

196
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,400
people move on,
you know,

197
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,930
clubs get hot,
different clubs.

198
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:49,931
I went there at one time in 1983,
maybe 84.

199
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:55,391
It was done.
My friend who's already done it was 

200
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:58,001
done.
It was just a bunch of assholes trying 

201
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:58,001
to be cool.

202
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:58,170
Wow.
And I followed the hundred dollar bill.

203
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,810
I was out of money with a bag of blow,
no cash,

204
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,390
not a dime in my pocket and I looked 
down at four in the morning.

205
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,230
It was $100 bill and that's how I got to
say that's how I got home.

206
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,420
That was it.
That's my studio.

207
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,070
Fifty four story.
It is weird though.

208
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,310
The nightclub scene,
the nightclub scenes are very strange 

209
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,150
scene and one club gets hot and then it 
dies off and the people that are in that

210
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,930
business like try to figure out what 
makes something hot and what doesn't.

211
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,931
You've got to rename places and Redo 
them and reopening and grand reopening 

212
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:35,121
and get people to show up.
Like I remember hearing that they were 

213
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:38,781
paying Paris Hilton like shit.
Piles of money to just show up at club 

214
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,840
because Kadesh Ian's view those people,
they pay a shit load of money.

215
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,410
You're there to take pictures of your 
club gets hot.

216
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,490
Then after about a year you started 
taking partners and yeah,

217
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,260
sure.
Because you go what's on the way?

218
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,410
The odds are against you.
So after a year some guy comes,

219
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,540
I love your place and I'll take her and 
that's how you get out of it or you do.

220
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:06,921
A lot of people didn't.
They just liked the place on fire and 

221
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:08,400
stuff and scratch a little Jewish 
lightning starts from scratch.

222
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,970
You know?
I knew the guy that owned the gay clubs 

223
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:13,980
in Houston like in the seventies and he 
was telling me one time,

224
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,370
he goes,
yeah,

225
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:19,371
once we got our youth side of him,
you light them on fire collecting 

226
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,790
insurance and they'll open up another 
club.

227
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,690
That's it.
Jewish,

228
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,400
lightning,
Jesus Christ.

229
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,710
It's a weird scene.
You know what I mean?

230
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,760
People that just look forward to just 
going out and just drinking and dancing 

231
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,630
and snorting coke every night,
just looking for like experience,

232
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:37,770
just something different and while that 
takes them out of their everyday grind,

233
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,370
just do it over and over and over and 
over.

234
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,650
Different.
Like when I was growing up it was club 

235
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,571
area was big and the rooftop you paid 
like 24 bucks to go in at 11:00

236
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,340
and you drank all night til seven in the
morning.

237
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,360
Twenty four bucks or you could drink it.
Shit.

238
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,390
Booze.
I mean you're not drinking cold Vasa gay

239
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:58,620
shit when you're doing blow your brother
that shit.

240
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:00,750
Anyway,
you come up and give you some sunglasses

241
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,080
and that's it.
If you went in after three was,

242
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,400
it was like 20 something after 11 and 
then like 17 bucks or you could drink 

243
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:15,681
after three,
so seven in the fucking morning and 

244
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:18,651
people were packed.
That's what New York was about back 

245
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:19,130
then.
It was just people staying there.

246
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:23,550
I post seven,
six New York has a forum,

247
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,830
last call once,
last call in New York.

248
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,470
I have no idea.
Florida,

249
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,320
I think it's even later than New York,
Florida,

250
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,510
Florida closes for one hour,
5:00

251
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:33,860
in the morning.

252
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,800
Let's say you're at the news cafe,
right?

253
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,550
Bullshit,
and we're having a good time at 5:00

254
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:39,780
they'll come over to you and say,
Hey,

255
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,110
do me a favor by 5:00.
The bars or the clothes so you can order

256
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,140
be at those six.
So we just sold a 25 bids and you wait 

257
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,390
til the ball because of six and now 
you're fucking ready to drink again.

258
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,470
I got those for one hour.
One hour.

259
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,300
This was back,
you know,

260
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,760
20 years ago,
15 years ago in coconut grove.

261
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,890
And weird rule.
One hour.

262
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Remember that place we used to go to 
right down the street from that Improv?

263
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,400
Yeah.
The loose cafe is a great place.

264
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,080
Great place,
great breakfast,

265
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,140
great fucking bar.
The club went downhill hard though.

266
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,850
Yeah.
That club and that place will.

267
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:17,851
The whole coconut grove area became the 
only thing that's still open to the 

268
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:17,851
dueling pianos.

269
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:22,740
The pizza joint that more the dueling 
piano places still ops in that little 

270
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,061
mall there with the movie theater.
They always have those right next to 

271
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,881
Improv.
It's like they have one in Addison to 

272
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,560
right addison.
They have one up next to Jon Lovitz up 

273
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:31,560
and universal.
They do.

274
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,470
Yeah.
They used to.

275
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,800
If there's a fucking pulling up,
their Miami has a 24 hour really 

276
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,180
drinking just Miami,
just in Miami entertainment district it 

277
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,180
says.
Oh,

278
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,970
well that makes sense.
It's 4:00

279
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,740
AM.
Broward County and key west.

280
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Yeah,
little different everywhere else in 

281
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,000
Orlando.
West Palm is where we always worked with

282
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,010
either worked in Miami at the Improv,
which is coconut grove or we did west 

283
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,610
palm after Joel opened up that new 
place.

284
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,600
The big giant.
That's a great place.

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,830
The new place though is like a a 
theater.

286
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,710
It's like 600 seats.
It's fucking huge.

287
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,240
I mean,
that's a huge club.

288
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,980
It's a great place that even for love.
That was a great club inside the casino,

289
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,040
which they're redoing over.
Oh yeah,

290
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,530
that shut down.
Oh dear to them next year.

291
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,640
Yeah.
We have no action.

292
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,150
No kidding.
That was a fun little fun little club,

293
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:25,930
but a good size.
That one in the hard rock is a good size

294
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,440
side.
Yeah.

295
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,500
The last time I was there there was a 
couple next to me that was fucking in 

296
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:36,631
the bedroom next to me and like animals.
I mean like fucking animals.

297
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,630
I mean like porno film animals.
Like like I was lying in bed and I heard

298
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:45,280
that and it was in the afternoon.
I'll try and take a nap and these people

299
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:47,650
were hammering just bang,
Bang,

300
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:47,980
Bang.

301
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:52,660
This

302
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,390
guy's just head.
I was like,

303
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:59,400
Jesus Christ.
I fucking Florida oxycodone one of those

304
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,020
pay relief centers.
You take two of those things.

305
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,320
You get hammered with addicted times and
she won't go dead boss route and told 

306
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,830
the story.
The other day that I read online,

307
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,660
I'm one of those martial arts websites 
about his addiction.

308
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,690
That's a great article.
Ooh,

309
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,820
scary.
Scary Shit.

310
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Scary Shit.
Or he was talking about trying to get 

311
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,050
off of it and how difficult it was,
and you're talking about a guy with like

312
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:26,310
an iron will,
you know,

313
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,380
in boss route and command and the 
average person who just has a hard time 

314
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,461
getting out of bed in the morning,
it doesn't have a lot of discipline and 

315
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:35,461
they get hooked.
Like that's it.

316
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:36,160
That's it.
You're gone.

317
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,040
It's fucking amazing.
That stuff's legal.

318
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,950
Did you watch 60 minutes?
Three weeks ago now?

319
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,680
That was the whole.
That was the motherfuckers.

320
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Motherfuckers wasn't just about the 
opioid epidemic and the dea stopped 

321
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,040
prosecuting.
The word

322
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,940
came from,
you know,

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,720
it's just a nightmare.
They're fucking terrible things.

324
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,580
Listen to those things.
A terrible.

325
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,710
Yeah.
There was a whole article recently about

326
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:05,711
the company that sells most of the 
opioids and the family that's behind 

327
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:09,920
that company and how many billions of 
dollars that they've made off the opioid

328
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,200
crisis,
opioid opioid,

329
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:16,390
or be it how we say opioid.
I always say it wrong once.

330
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:19,250
I should grips you that synthetic 
heroin,

331
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,830
that's what that is.
Essentially.

332
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,180
Yeah,
it's a.

333
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,490
it's a bad grip.
Like I said,

334
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:30,491
I took a 16th one night in my living 
room where they had to lay later and 

335
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:34,571
that was my.
That's my whole resume without guns and 

336
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:38,360
I'm a fucking meal.
I can eat 2000 milligrams of thc and 

337
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,450
live a 16th one of those pills.
I popped.

338
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,800
It was just a little piece.
Nothing.

339
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,340
My blood pressure drops so fucking much.

340
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,360
I just laid down with the sleep and I 
knew my pill career had come through 

341
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,660
that never even let it start.
Really?

342
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,760
Never even let it start.
Can you believe brother?

343
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,750
In two weeks it's going to be 10 years 
since I've done that.

344
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,460
Wipe out.
I want you to think about that.

345
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,970
Wow.
I want you to really think about.

346
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,980
I still remember being at Cobb's with 
you that January and like go and it's 

347
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,751
been two months.
I don't know if I could really do this 

348
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:16,211
shit.
Like I don't know if I control this 

349
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:17,510
feeling and I control it.
So you like when you quit,

350
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,560
what was like the first week like hell,
hell,

351
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,620
first two weeks were hell.
Did you think about going back just 

352
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:26,620
like,
I can't do this,

353
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,060
or did you know that you had had to make
a change?

354
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,990
I had to make a change.

355
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,120
I knew that my spine was starting to 
hurt.

356
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,300
I knew the spineless started hurting.
I was trying to get job just by four in 

357
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:38,120
the morning.
You know,

358
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,970
after you do coke right at the tip over 
here,

359
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,020
people have done coke at like 
Parkinson's gives a fuck that.

360
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:45,320
No,
no,

361
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:45,550
no,
no,

362
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,220
no.
Once.

363
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I think that's related while a lot.
A lot of old timers that did a lot of 

364
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,160
coke in the seventies and then they 
wound up like some serious neuromuscular

365
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,210
Muskegon,
absolute.

366
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,400
That shit's shocks.
Just central nervous system.

367
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,640
There was times I did cocaine that was 
electric.

368
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,240
It was like when you put that thing in 
your hand or you get electrocuted,

369
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,270
you could feel the electric and your 
body and next day like that in your 

370
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,230
brain,
like you can actually see the neural 

371
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,380
transmitters a fucking on fire.
You could feel that.

372
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,890
You know,
I could tell when I would go on stage 

373
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:23,890
after doing two or three nights of blow 
that week,

374
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,390
I had no control.
I really had no control over my 

375
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,300
material.
I had no control over my delivery.

376
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,650
That's what I wanted to tell you.
Like you're just the way you off.

377
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,960
Yeah.
Your mind can't grip it.

378
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:39,440
You can't sell the joke.
The facial doesn't connect with the hand

379
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,340
movement or the breathing.
So like,

380
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,010
I knew that that was always going to be 
a danger in the future.

381
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:46,690
Now,
you know,

382
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,690
I take all that,
uh,

383
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,970
for like a year I drank those,
uh,

384
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,390
what's your buddy's name that makes the 
neurosurgeon milkshakes?

385
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,640
The football player that fucking beat 
the guy up and asking.

386
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,450
I took all his stuff for like a year 
just to.

387
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,890
Yeah,
the orange drink and snack for neuro 

388
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:06,890
one.
That stuff it got.

389
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,980
Yeah,
it felt good.

390
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,120
It felt a lot better.
Give your brain some nutrient control.

391
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,260
Yeah.
But 10 years,

392
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:15,180
I mean that,
that uh,

393
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:18,290
I had to do a benefit and hoboken and I 
had gotten.

394
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,550
I like that whole summer I tried to get 
off coke.

395
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:25,551
I was doing the heroin that was trying 
to get off the coke and shit and then 

396
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:28,941
that September I read the heroin,
so I was doing it like maybe once a week

397
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,660
and the whole thing went down in 
Maryland.

398
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:34,350
I knew I had to stop and then I had this
thing in hoboken.

399
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,450
I went whole thing went down,
Maryland Martinez.

400
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,300
She was dying.
I went,

401
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,580
I went back east that week and she was 
dying.

402
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:42,840
I don't know what happened.
It was like,

403
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:47,841
you know what?
I was trying to get coke on Friday 

404
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:47,841
night.
I couldn't get it and I just took it for

405
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:47,841
what it was.

406
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,590
I was trying to get coconut Saturday.
I couldn't get it,

407
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,200
so fuck it.
I took the plane back Sunday.

408
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,910
I couldn't get it here.
Something happened.

409
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:58,911
I couldn't get it.
And then that Monday I had a meeting to 

410
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:00,180
do a movie and at the end of the meeting
the guy said,

411
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,880
listen man,
we know about your drug problem.

412
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,250
So before you say yes,
we want you to think about this because 

413
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,441
you can't miss a day on this movie.
You cannot be late if you're late to the

414
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,300
whole movie.
Can't shoot because it was a cast.

415
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,790
We all shot in one room was in a 
meeting,

416
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,560
so I thought about it,
I'll do it and that was the roughest 

417
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,890
fucking month because I was just going 
home and before 8:00

418
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:28,320
would start,
I would just go to bed.

419
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,720
At 8:00
was my cocaine time.

420
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,180
That's what my body would start to ache.

421
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,350
That's when I couldn't even.
You could be telling me the most 

422
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,350
important thing in your life and I'd be 
watching you,

423
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,261
but I couldn't hear.
All my mind was focused on was getting 

424
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:46,761
that blow at 8:00
and then I would figure out how to get 

425
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:46,860
to 60 bucks.
You know,

426
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,060
I'm going to go to the ATM machine.
I would shoot over the rock and roll 

427
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,681
routes.
There's an ATM machine in front of rock 

428
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:54,681
and roll.
Ralph's right there.

429
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,010
Yeah.
And I would take 60 bucks out there.

430
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,620
I would rather you red light to get to 
the ATM machine,

431
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,250
but it doesn't give a fuck.
We to give a fuck.

432
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,190
And then from there we just make the u 
turn,

433
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,610
go to my dealer's house,
go home and leave the coke there and now

434
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:13,611
is ready for the night.
I was in peace just knowing that the 

435
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:13,611
coke was at the house,
I didn't have to do it.

436
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,720
You know,
I

437
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,760
don't,
I've never been physically addicted to 

438
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:19,760
something in a way where I had a hard 
time kicking it.

439
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,400
But I've had some psychological 
addictions for sure.

440
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,760
And I think that one of the things that 
I've gotten out of this month of no 

441
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,400
sober October thing that Tom Burton,
Ari and I are doing is that a lot of it 

442
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,670
is psychological.
A lot of it is psychological.

443
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,210
It's just knowing that we can't smoke 
pot or can't drink all month.

444
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,860
You start thinking about,
oh,

445
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,310
we're at the homestretch November first 
round the corner.

446
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,900
Like I don't really feel like I need to 
get high.

447
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:46,970
It's not like our needed a drink 
tomorrow,

448
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,910
but it's knowing that I can't do it for 
the month where it hangs over your head.

449
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,090
So that's what's even more impressive 
that you could kick it because it's not 

450
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,340
just the fact that you have like a 
physical problem,

451
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,130
but you also have the psychological 
problem,

452
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,370
like the psychological part of it is 
like it's a pattern that you're 

453
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:08,370
comfortable with.

454
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,870
You got used to that pattern of 8:00,
you looking for the coke,

455
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,810
you go and do it and then you're off.
It's like you're off.

456
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,870
Even though you're in chaos,
your life's in disarray and you're in 

457
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,870
the grips of addiction.
You're comfortable with that feeling.

458
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:22,480
You've been there before and you're for 
whatever reason,

459
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,730
when people get used to fucking up and 
they go,

460
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:29,731
why do I keep fucking up?
One of the reasons you keep fucking up 

461
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:30,910
because you're used to fuck us it.
And it's not an uncomfortable feeling in

462
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:32,800
the sense that it's,
it's you know,

463
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:33,850
it,
it might suck,

464
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,410
but you know,
it's the devil,

465
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:35,860
you know,

466
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,570
you know,
that was nice.

467
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:39,950
I didn't want to do it.
I still did it.

468
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,190
Can this family.
I didn't want to do it.

469
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,440
Like I didn't need to do it.
Like I didn't feel.

470
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,720
I just want to do it,
but it was just something to do,

471
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,850
like it was just something to do.
Wow.

472
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,910
It was just something to do,
but you know what I tell people all the 

473
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,910
time is you want to have to quit.
It just doesn't happen.

474
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:58,970
Like I quit at 44.
I'm no fucking genius,

475
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,060
but it took me two years.
Like it was a two year struggle,

476
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:07,061
like a personal little struggle.
Like when did you know that it was with 

477
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:07,061
you that you were free

478
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,630
because you didn't go to Aa?
Na narcotics anonymous.

479
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:15,080
I went to one meeting in a meeting and I
wanted Hollywood,

480
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,520
which everything is good until you go to
it and Hollywood because Hollywood,

481
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:22,880
you act that you,
you add the dramatic and the actor image

482
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:24,410
to it.
You know,

483
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,880
if you go to an AA meeting in jersey,
they're in this smoking camel,

484
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,970
reds fucking talking from the heart.
You're going to have a meeting and 

485
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,370
Hollywood.
You got people with eight tattoos on 

486
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:37,370
their own.
How can each other,

487
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,310
you know it's a fucking jam burry.
They're just happy to be in a new clan 

488
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,160
that they're in and then what happens is
after about two months in this area,

489
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:50,450
for some reason I have noticed because I
have a lot of friends in a date,

490
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,230
somebody approaches you and says hi,
you know what's going on?

491
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,460
And you're like,
I'm struggling with like,

492
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,910
why have you seen Dr Bob?

493
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,600
Dr Bob Gross.
I'm just making this.

494
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,520
I talked to Bob.
Oh my God,

495
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,700
to tell them about Dr.
Bob told Joe about Dr Bob.

496
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:08,330
Dr Bob has changed your whole life.
So basically you'll see Dr Bob.

497
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,850
He goes,
your bullshit referendum.

498
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:12,530
Whatever,
a prescription,

499
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:14,050
what you have.
Oh,

500
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,460
you're bipolar,
you're this.

501
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,010
Now they start shooting adderall,
adderall,

502
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,420
all the other shit.
So you're really sober.

503
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,140
A,
you're really not so,

504
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,650
but you see now after I got clean,
I discovered I had a problem.

505
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,370
I discovered I was bipolar or Johnny 
bots or this or that or this or that.

506
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,080
Medication they give you,
you know,

507
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,530
on top of the opiod epidemic.
How bad a fucking adderall.

508
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,270
Adderall is so fucked up.
We have someone every month

509
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,180
that's on when they're doing the 
podcast,

510
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,720
it's obvious.
Yes,

511
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,240
they can't shut the fuck up.
They talking to very fast paced.

512
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,790
They're really excited to you.
Just a little bit too much energy.

513
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,810
There's something about them that you 
just know and you just like.

514
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:56,470
You could tell like you're like,
Whoa,

515
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,260
whoa,
slow down.

516
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,350
Sometimes I'll offer him a drink.
I mean I've had people on the podcast 

517
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,651
where I tried to figure out what the 
fuck was going on and then later on in 

518
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:06,350
the podcast they told me they did 
adderall and I was like,

519
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,210
okay,
now I get it.

520
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:08,970
Oh wait,
no,

521
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:09,860
no,
world is tensioned.

522
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:14,861
It's crazy chick.
We knew that you should take to 

523
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:14,861
adderalls and fucking chicken west palm 
or something.

524
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:16,280
Used to drink.
Oh,

525
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:17,570
to.
To everybody does.

526
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,750
Do you.
Do you know how many people do it 

527
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:22,750
though?
I'm getting stunned.

528
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,910
All my families that I know,
like with my kids are friends with 

529
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,271
their,
their kids and I get to know these 

530
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:33,221
people.
Fucking these all these like successful 

531
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,210
suburban people are doing adderall the 
time.

532
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,660
That's how they get through work.
That's how they become successful.

533
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,210
They're always hustling.
They're always getting things done,

534
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,360
and these motherfuckers,
they always want the newest shit.

535
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,370
They want the newest watch.
Oh,

536
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:48,320
is that the newest Hugh Bowl?
Is that the newest?

537
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,730
This is that the newest dad.
Oh,

538
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:52,040
he's got the Mercedes amg.
Oh look,

539
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,470
he's got this and she's there.
She bought a house in the oaks.

540
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,340
Oh look at this and she's got that and 
we'll get that purse.

541
00:24:58,341 --> 00:24:59,390
Yeah.
Where'd you get that?

542
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,950
Heard that.
Such a Hermes.

543
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,180
Oh,
you can't get those.

544
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:07,330
All they're doing is like chasing after 
these things so they can go places and 

545
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,350
other people will look at this new thing
that they have.

546
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,380
It's very strange.
It's like there's one thing like if you 

547
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,490
know someone who collects a certain 
thing,

548
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:19,940
like there were really into fucking 
whatever it is,

549
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,640
old Samurai swords or something like 
that though.

550
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,260
They love the history of it.
That's not what these people are doing.

551
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,790
They're buying things so that they could
bring places and other people would go,

552
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,830
Woo.
So they get a feeling like a feeling of 

553
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,280
a,
I guess a successful feeling.

554
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,510
You know,
they get a feeling from other people 

555
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,510
recognizing that they have the latest 
thing.

556
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,510
Like,
Oh,

557
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,030
where'd you get that jacket?
Oh,

558
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:42,500
look at that purse.
Oh,

559
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,180
look at that.
We could that chain.

560
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,910
How many carats is that ring?
Let me see your ring.

561
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,620
Oh girlfriend,
let me see your ring.

562
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,420
Amazing.
It's so cute.

563
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,270
Those shoes are so cute.
Oh my God.

564
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:57,050
So cute.
And they're just like weird fucking just

565
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,280
pilled up people Weirdo,
speeded up people that are like chasing 

566
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,970
after the next object.

567
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,710
It's a ferry.
It's a very strange.

568
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,790
And they don't talk about shit.
I get together with these people,

569
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:15,791
you know,
because we'll have dinners together or 

570
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,611
our families would get together,
the kids would play and we'll go to a 

571
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,780
party together and you know,
a good 20 percent of these people do not

572
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:24,050
talk about shit.
All they talk about is objects.

573
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:29,290
It's talking about this object and that 
object and how much this is worth and 

574
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,771
how much real estate's going for here.
And that's the whole focus of 

575
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:36,311
conversation.
It's like an anti human conversation 

576
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:36,770
because they're not talking about 
anything human.

577
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,200
They're not talking about,
you know,

578
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:44,210
the community,
what they love about life and their 

579
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,710
experiences as a parent and none of that
man,

580
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,630
a lot of them don't even pay attention 
to their kids.

581
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,320
They,
they,

582
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,440
they go and drink and leave the kids 
outside and the kids are just fucking 

583
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,940
hitting other kids with sticks and shit 
and go and study and then when they come

584
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,140
out,
oh my kid's a good kid,

585
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:58,830
he doesn't do that.

586
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,650
Then they go back inside and drink more 
and it's like crazy.

587
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,980
It's really interesting to see.
It's like the things that fuel success 

588
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,290
in a lot of people are a lot of these 
folks.

589
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:15,291
It's like this,
this need for material possessions and 

590
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:18,090
then pills and this is,
this is what's going on.

591
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,340
You didn't come you with a different 
company.

592
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,460
The best home conditions available to 
us,

593
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,680
you know,
fucking brady bunch in your house.

594
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm not insulting.
You know,

595
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,000
you're just saying that you had to 
deliver papers,

596
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,730
that your mother had a work and Lou with
the whole fucking thing.

597
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,330
You have a sit there sometimes at one of
these fucking parties with these people 

598
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,361
who have everything,
everything we didn't have and you'll 

599
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:43,791
like.
My parents were 20 times better than 

600
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:43,791
these fucking people.
As a parent,

601
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,200
like I'm sitting there every day now 
that I'm a parent,

602
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:48,250
I go to pools,
I go to gymnastics tonight,

603
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,440
I got a fucking recital.

604
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,920
I mean I have to do this.
Who the fuck apart of my I am,

605
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,210
but I see these people that do this shit
and I'm like,

606
00:27:57,211 --> 00:28:02,211
my mother was a fucking booky.
My mother on the ball and she was a 

607
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:06,531
drunk and she was way better parents and
these fucking cops because she was 

608
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,960
there.
Interest is what it is.

609
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,340
I think what we're talking about with 
this pill thing,

610
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,770
there's a lot of people that are on 
antidepressants.

611
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,080
There's a lot of people that are on 
adderall does.

612
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:21,081
A lot of people are on Xanax.
There's a lot of people that are a lot 

613
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:23,580
of weird disassociated lives and these 
disassociative pills,

614
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,580
you see it in how they interact with 
their children.

615
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,370
They just,
they just zone out.

616
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,700
They're not there.
Even if you're like stressed out about 

617
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700
your kid and you're interacting with 
your kid,

618
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,261
at least the kid knows you're 
communicating with them and then the 

619
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:39,261
kids probably not happy that you're 
stressed out,

620
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:43,191
but at least you're there when you're 
zoned out on pills and staring at the 

621
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:43,191
fucking clouds.

622
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:45,450
It's just,
it's just not.

623
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,930
It's not a good way for human beings to 
interact with each other while you're 

624
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,000
hopped up on some weird shit and I 
think,

625
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,270
I mean,
I don't know what the actual numbers 

626
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,771
are,
but are in the communities that I 

627
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:02,871
associate with.
I would say a good solid half of these 

628
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:03,690
fucking people are pilled up a good 
solid half.

629
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,110
They're either pilled up on Xanax.
What's really hilarious as I've talked 

630
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,390
to some of these people and they're 
like,

631
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:10,770
I don't know how you get smoked pot 
every day.

632
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:11,190
I'm like,
bitch,

633
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:14,820
you take a xanax every morning.
Every morning you take a xanax.

634
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,370
I know a lady who takes xanax every time
she gets in her car,

635
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,230
she was like,
just too much traffic.

636
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:21,720
Book Pop,
Xanax for traffic.

637
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:26,721
They pop a Xanax to go to sleep.
They pop a xanax because they have to 

638
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:26,721
fly.
Oh,

639
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:27,390
I have to fly.
I need a Xanax.

640
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,770
I've even got A.
Yeah.

641
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,270
For those.
For our flights,

642
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,800
I just can't sit there no more.
Well,

643
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:33,870
those intervals make you think about the
universe.

644
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,500
I mean people say Ooh,
excuse and I'm not trying to be a 

645
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:39,500
different thing.
It's a different thing though.

646
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,830
When I have mercy in the morning,
I don't fucking get high,

647
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,440
don't get high.
Like I have her in the mornings before 

648
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,291
school and I drive.
I try to because I got to walk into 

649
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:49,291
school,
want to read like it.

650
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:53,460
They already wanted me one time.
They wanted you to smell like pick her 

651
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,190
up and one of the teachers came in and 
she goes a little last Friday.

652
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:59,120
You were kicking pungent last Friday so 
I can't embarrass my daughter.

653
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:02,020
So I tried to read that was it.
Once they said it,

654
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,170
that's funny.
Then the afternoons I'd take my chances.

655
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,350
I get high,
go to the gym.

656
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,520
This class was swimming or the ballet or
whatever the fuck we you have to do.

657
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:10,240
And then after that,
you know,

658
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,540
I'm out with my friends or doing the 
podcasts or doing comedy.

659
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,770
So,
but adderall and I don't have beer in my

660
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,780
house.
You don't really drink,

661
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,980
you've never been.
I don't want to.

662
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,390
I don't want alcohol in my house now 
that have a child.

663
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,220
I don't want alcohol in my house.
Well,

664
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:32,221
I'll tell you what,
if there's one thing that I could kick 

665
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:32,221
that,
uh,

666
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:32,221
you know,
like sober October Shit,

667
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,240
like if I could,
uh,

668
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,260
if I had to choose like for the rest of 
my life,

669
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,230
no boobs are no pot.
I would say no booze in a heartbeat.

670
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,640
Yeah.
But I like the cold Heineken attempt,

671
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,920
cold,
cold,

672
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,150
fucking delicious.
But I get something out of pot.

673
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,930
I get like sensitivity.
I get community,

674
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,740
I get compassion,
I get introspective thinking,

675
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,530
I start,
I examined myself more.

676
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,440
I become more humble.
I get something out of it.

677
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:04,441
I get real benefits out of pot.
Like a lot of the benefits of benefits 

678
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:06,500
that some people would call paranoia or 
you know,

679
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,360
the,
the people,

680
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:08,800
uh,
they freak out because,

681
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,360
you know,
they think the walls are closing in.

682
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,270
I love that.
That's.

683
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,220
Yeah,
that's good for you.

684
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,530
I live in that world.
I fucking love it.

685
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,980
I love somebody telling me I'm a loser.
Gather together.

686
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,810
Have been done.
Dick Today.

687
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,000
Get out of fucking you.
Watch TV A.

688
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:29,050
I've taken it the proud of.
I'm very proud of Bert Kreischer for 

689
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,900
cooking the booze this month and let's 
hope it stays off of it.

690
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,670
Well,
or at least,

691
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,090
what do you think of regulates it?
You put these guys in Rehab this month.

692
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,670
Pretty much think of Rehab is rehab is 
just to let you know where you stand.

693
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,740
Sixty days of you that are doing a 
certain something makes you know where 

694
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,190
you stand and sometimes you'll go,
you know what,

695
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:49,600
Joe Rogan,
I'm not going to smoke pot,

696
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,310
but I'm going to have my drink twice a 
week.

697
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,080
That's too.
You know,

698
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,140
bird has a prom flying,
you know,

699
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:57,670
he likes to fucking get twisted.

700
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,700
You know Birch,
what you call a social drink,

701
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,040
some fucking Florida.
Yeah.

702
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,980
Know they wake up,
they have the little fucking Cock Pale,

703
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:07,150
whatever.
The ticket nap,

704
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:08,650
they go to the beach.
You would.

705
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:09,700
I don't know,
that life.

706
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,730
I've never lived that life of drinking 
all day and then taking them that Brits 

707
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,310
are real soldier,
you know,

708
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,210
bridge not fucking around Bernstein on 
amateur show birds,

709
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,560
the real deal.
I saw him running a couple of tasks on.

710
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:25,630
I'm running through my car and when he 
was running at me,

711
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:30,631
this shit with this little thing.
I just took the car and just started 

712
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:30,631
going at him and he's like,
Eh,

713
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:31,020
last.
They looked at me.

714
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:31,990
He's like,
ah,

715
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,240
because he's in my neighborhood.
So I saw,

716
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,640
I watched them a lot.
I went over there.

717
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,410
I tried to get them high.
He wouldn't fall.

718
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,490
Bring,
uh,

719
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,740
he was going to bring a drug tests the 
other day when we were,

720
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,470
I was on number 13,
I think,

721
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,680
and day we're on number 14.
And Red was gonna stop at Cvs and pick 

722
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,900
up those marijuana tests.
But he just didn't have the time.

723
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,370
I'm very proud of birth and all of this 
is going to let you do look at even you 

724
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,460
with the reef of them.
It's going to let you know that you 

725
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,590
didn't have too much.
Like when I went to prison,

726
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,930
the hardest thing about prison wasn't 
going to prison.

727
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:13,931
You know it was,
how am I going to live without my 

728
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:13,931
marijuana?
Really?

729
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:17,890
I'm I going to fuck you sleep.
I wasn't worried about nothing else in 

730
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,810
prison except marijuana.
I didn't get any in prison.

731
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,370
No,
you could $50 bucks for two joints.

732
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:24,110
I will brown weed.
I wasn't doing that,

733
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,290
but after the first week you learned 
about yourself.

734
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,220
You learned that you could go with that,
which is one of the strongest things 

735
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,580
that could happen to somebody.
It's like when you're.

736
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,360
When you're in love with that girl and 
you're destroying your life,

737
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,160
your job,
your drink,

738
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:43,850
and you act like an asshole and then she
goes away to Hawaii for two weeks.

739
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,700
After 10 days you're like,
fuck that bitch.

740
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,420
When you did people get divorced when 
they lot.

741
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,250
When their wives leave for 10 days.
Yeah.

742
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,950
The wife goes back to see the mother.
You're sitting there going,

743
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,550
what am I doing?
What am I doing?

744
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,140
I'm much happier in this house.
I could put her in the back somewhere 

745
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,841
and not see.
Know that's what happens when you 

746
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:06,140
realize you could do without.
That's one of the biggest things in your

747
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:09,020
world that could happen to date.
You have no idea.

748
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,230
Well,
you don't think you could do without in 

749
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,230
the beginning because you think maybe 
you could possibly get her back.

750
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,570
If you can get it back,
everything's going to go.

751
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,810
You got this bad feeling because she's 
thinking about leaving.

752
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,570
You're like,
oh no,

753
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,740
she's going to leave Melbourne.
Maybe I can talk her back in.

754
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,480
Maybe I could buy or something.
Maybe I can do something.

755
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:26,481
Maybe we changed my weights and I'll 
bring her back and I'll bring her back 

756
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,700
and everything's gonna be fine,
but everything is fine and if she leaves

757
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:31,820
you just meet somebody else.
Just come on,

758
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,890
relax a second,
and I gave up sodas.

759
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,060
I never thought I could give her a coke 
and fucking crazy like those.

760
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,690
Do you like those things?
What?

761
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:44,970
Oh Jamie enough.
So what's the seaview Zevia sodas with 

762
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,990
that flavor with Stevia.
People think I'm doing a fucking 

763
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:49,990
commercial for these things.
They don't.

764
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,580
They haven't paid me a nickel.
I'm not taking it in their money to 

765
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,940
their soda,
but their flavor with Stevia and you 

766
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,600
don't get no sugar at all.

767
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,230
They have like,
um,

768
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,720
raspberry.
They have um,

769
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,900
root beers.
They have like one that's like a seven 

770
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,871
up.
They have one that's like a grapefruit 

771
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:10,871
soda.
They have a bunch of different ones.

772
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:11,180
Man.
They're fucking great.

773
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,130
I love them.
I'm so hooked on water.

774
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:17,400
The water's great too.
I don't give a fuck anymore out of these

775
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,430
stupid things.
So they do have a cola one,

776
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:20,900
right?
Give them that cream soda.

777
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,760
That one's the shit.
That right there.

778
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,380
Bam.
Diet Cola,

779
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,270
diet coke sucks.
About a month ago I was on a plane and I

780
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:32,030
was a little loopy.
I just said,

781
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:32,930
let me try it.
Coke,

782
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,550
coke.
I couldn't even finish the little 

783
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,550
fucking eight ounce glass.
We only.

784
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,550
Sweet.
Yeah,

785
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,940
day accidentally.
I was late night drive through starving,

786
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,970
coming off from the store and I got a 
burger and I asked for a diet coke and 

787
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:46,970
they gave me a regular coke and I went,
oh,

788
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,210
this is so good.

789
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,690
Who was so delicious?
The once a month I'm going to give 

790
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,630
myself a coke or actual cocacola once a 
month.

791
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,900
Once you get the Mexican ones with the 
rule.

792
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,940
Yeah,
the Medical Silica Taco joint.

793
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,240
Go to cactus and where you guys usually 
go right there.

794
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:08,241
They fucking good.
But once you realize like you know we 

795
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:08,350
gotta I grew up in Jersey.
I got the sandwich,

796
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:09,900
I got a bag of chips.
Right.

797
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,150
It's not the sandwich that killed.
It's a bag of chips.

798
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,490
If I haven't Turkey with Swiss and 
Avocado,

799
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:15,790
I'm not going to fucking die.
Right.

800
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,510
It's the fucking point two ounce bag of 
chips.

801
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,550
All those things.
Once you give them up,

802
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,110
like I had to give him up a 
weightwatchers.

803
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,920
They were tough potatoes with breakfast.
That was tough.

804
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,350
That was tough.
Those.

805
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,410
Yup.
For me,

806
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,460
it's when switching over to like in and 
out and getting a double double with the

807
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,110
lettuce,
with lettuce,

808
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,950
rapping on the top of it or whatever 
that's called it protein style to stuff.

809
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,790
That's the way to go because you still 
enjoy the shit out of it.

810
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,780
Tastes amazing,
but you're not getting all that bread.

811
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,320
It's still fantastic and it's really not
bad for you.

812
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:49,200
I mean it's just ground beef,
cheese,

813
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,520
lettuce.
It's not.

814
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:52,950
I mean there's nothing terrible for you 
there.

815
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,650
I just think that,
you know,

816
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:59,280
when you spend too much time eating 
shitty food,

817
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,090
your body is going to just feel 
terrible,

818
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:06,240
but if you could just limit that shitty 
food to occasionally,

819
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,420
then you'll appreciate.
Enjoy just for have meatball sub know 

820
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,300
every,
every now and then,

821
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,870
you know,
Loretta's ever go to Cabaretta fucking 

822
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:17,870
place.
So good.

823
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,070
I get a sausage and pepper sub there 
every now and then.

824
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,060
Ooh,
was real Italian bread.

825
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:26,850
I mean,
it's a fucking thick outer crust,

826
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:31,851
Italian bread.
We can clamp it down and it's hard on 

827
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:31,950
the outside,
but soft on the inside.

828
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,950
You bite into that and you feel that 
real juicy Italian sausage and that 

829
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,830
Marinara sauce.
Two weeks,

830
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
two weeks,
two weeks ago,

831
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,030
I go home with two week.
Oh,

832
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:44,820
you're going home in two weeks.
I save everything for when I go home.

833
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't fuck around no more.
I don't eat Chinese food out of him no 

834
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,020
more.
Don't do you don't fuck around though.

835
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,620
What about pizza?
Do you fuck around?

836
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,310
Why?
I had to stop.

837
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,400
I gotTa Stop Sam.
I got a place by my house.

838
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,990
I got to tell you something.
If I walk in there with you,

839
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,280
you'll drive them really good.
Don't take the pie the go.

840
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,340
No,
you don't get enough credit.

841
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Just slice.
You got to get the slices to the 

842
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,360
rotating.
You bring that pie hole.

843
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,780
It's like a fucking falafel,
like you've got to bring it home and put

844
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:14,610
it in Europe and all over again.

845
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,950
That's the secret.
You have to put a your and all over.

846
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:19,230
You know and no one does right here.
White Pizza?

847
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,540
No,
because no was Catholic.

848
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,080
There was a fucking.
There's a pizza place in white plains,

849
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:30,081
New York,
down the street from executive 

850
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:30,081
billiards,
I think it was Nicky's Nicky's pizzeria,

851
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:34,660
and they had this fucking white cheese 
sliced this white pizza slice width and 

852
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:39,831
it had like you could see the olive oil 
and butter and the pizza and the garlic 

853
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,770
and you would bite into it.
You'd be like,

854
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:45,300
holy Christ,
and the Cross to the pizza underneath is

855
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:49,540
just like the just the right amount of 
cooked where there was like a little bit

856
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:54,541
of a slight burn to the crossed and 
you're biting into it and you just feel 

857
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:59,231
in the cheese,
in the dough and all the sauces and the 

858
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:03,090
whole awesome fucking during lent.
When you grow up back then you go to 

859
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:08,821
your friend's house on Friday,
they got like muscles and red sauce and 

860
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:08,821
Nikki's.

861
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,420
That's the place and white fucking 
pizza.

862
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,600
We'd walk to that place right from 
executive billions right down the 

863
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:15,970
street.
Fucking phenomenal place.

864
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:21,060
So are good street,
fight their wants and that's what it 

865
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,131
means.
The other thing that bothers me the 

866
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:25,131
most,
you know the slices,

867
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:25,780
two slices.
Yeah,

868
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,140
because a move,
a slice is a thing of the move.

869
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,090
Okay.
What's a slice of a move?

870
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,240
A slice of a move as you mean you're on 
the fucking move.

871
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,930
When I come in to see Joe's pizza and I 
go,

872
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,750
let me get to cheese to go and you give 
them to me the thing and I fold them up.

873
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:44,410
I eat one there and take one with and 
went to go get a slice in Hollywood.

874
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,690
Somewhat.
What happens?

875
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,520
They take it,
they write a receipt,

876
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,680
they hang it up and some other guy 
comes,

877
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,270
takes the slice out,
puts it in.

878
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,660
You have to wait for 10 minutes.
Then they come with a number and they 

879
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:57,660
give me the fucking slice.
Listen,

880
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,480
do it all.
One shot.

881
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,280
Use your dirty hands and ain't going to 
kill me.

882
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,950
They ain't going to kill.
We have them give a fuck if you scratch.

883
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:05,230
Yes,
grow the fuck the heat from the oven.

884
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:06,610
They'll kill the job.
She know what I'm saying.

885
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,880
Just troll the slicing.
Everything's a process.

886
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,970
A slice.
That's the whole corporate.

887
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,410
Yeah,
it's a move.

888
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,540
It's like that shit.
I know what you mean.

889
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Everything has become corporate and 
these places that you're never going to 

890
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,851
get that old small restaurant feel from 
place like this that you'll get from a 

891
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:30,791
place like Nikki's pizzeria.
You know you don't and that the flavors 

892
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:32,800
are different.
We've talked about this before.

893
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:37,801
I don't know what it is,
and I've heard people say it's the 

894
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:37,801
water,
but whatever it is,

895
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:38,350
the place down the block from Gotham.

896
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,630
That's what I can do.
Golf.

897
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:46,770
I'll show you this slide right here.
I even took a picture of that guy that 

898
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,230
got shot in there that'll make you 
asshole fallout in this.

899
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,470
I just took a bite of it.
I will need a host from boat.

900
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,500
That's a heart attack at night.
That's a delicious meal whether 

901
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Stromboli,
but that's a heart attack.

902
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,150
That's,
you know.

903
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,510
Well,
it's got a good trumball yeah.

904
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,060
Vegas.
Vegas is a place of Vegas that you got 

905
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,330
to Stromboli and they put.
They have couches in the back.

906
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,560
Well,
they must have leftover.

907
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,800
If we can take a nap,
take a nap.

908
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,200
I have leftover guineas from when the 
mob ran vegas.

909
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,480
Right.
You could use to go to a place that,

910
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,510
uh,
emily used to take you to the Italian 

911
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,640
pool place that you said,
this place.

912
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,680
That place went under,
unfortunately.

913
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,390
Did.
Yeah,

914
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,500
it did.
That place was fantastic.

915
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,750
That was some of the best Italian food 
in Vegas.

916
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:31,290
And you would get it at a pool hall.
It was so weird.

917
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,080
Okay.
Beautiful.

918
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:34,040
That slices put the fucking

919
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,840
sauces from Bali.
My Nice Guy.

920
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,520
That's like a florist with beautiful 
flowers.

921
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,750
This is dose or models.
Cuban restaurant.

922
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,140
They'd been serving Cuban steak 
sandwiches is 1960.

923
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,320
That's all they do.
That's all they do.

924
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,260
The steak sandwiches a place west,
New York,

925
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:59,261
New Jersey.
That's the place we took pictures of 

926
00:41:59,261 --> 00:41:59,261
people.
So that's beauty.

927
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:00,290
That's Mona Lisa.
My world.

928
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,150
Look at the Strombolis.
Look at his phone is filled with 

929
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,720
pictures.
Lots of tales.

930
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,960
The day.
The one from Jersey with the cream of 

931
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,060
them place here.
You can have all those Italian fucking 

932
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,060
cookie.
Look at that.

933
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,180
Fucking look at that.
Fucking.

934
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,010
What does that mean?
What do you call those?

935
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,450
Yeah.
Fucking cannoli.

936
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,340
Oh my God.
Oh.

937
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,710
Can take pictures of my kids.
Take pictures of food.

938
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,600
Fuck the kid.
Give me pictures of food.

939
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,760
Food.
I just take pictures.

940
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,460
I could show people here.
We're missing

941
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:47,990
like this is what this doing this yoga 
thing where I did nine,

942
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,310
10 yoga classes in a row,
whatever it was.

943
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:55,311
I think it was 10 you.
I'm hungry all the time because I'm 

944
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:57,360
doing 90 minutes of yoga every day,
every single day.

945
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:59,880
Not a day off for nine days or whatever 
it was.

946
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,920
Let's say it was nine,
but even if it was nine,

947
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,400
I took a day off before that I did two 
days in a row,

948
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:10,430
so it's like over the last couple of 
days or last couple of weeks it was 11 

949
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:14,820
classes in,
mostly in a row and just always hungry.

950
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Just constantly hungry like your body is
just craving it and so I've been eating 

951
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,270
all sorts of shit that I never allow 
myself to eat like late night,

952
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,540
like grabbing a burger on the.
Like I had a Wendy's burger last night.

953
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:25,410
Coming home from the store.

954
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,190
Not good for you,
but felt good.

955
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,560
Well,
you burned right through that.

956
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,370
I do work out a lot through.
It's still not the smartest thing to do,

957
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:40,490
just not.
I feel so much better when I don't do 

958
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:40,740
that.
When I just limit myself to that.

959
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:43,470
Like once a week I feel so much better,
but I just,

960
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,650
I don't,
I don't necessarily think it's good to 

961
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,320
do anything nine days in a row.
I just feel like your body's just like,

962
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:53,010
I've got a weird hamstring pull that's 
going on right now and he just.

963
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,790
Everything feels like a little worn out.
You didn't run this month?

964
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,340
I didn't run but one one day.
The first week of the month I lifted 

965
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:07,191
weights a couple times here and there,
but almost the entire month has been 

966
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:07,191
yoga

967
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,630
so far with the aid.
Jujitsu's eight,

968
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:15,050
you know when I go on the road and 
pickle and the weights and I do this 

969
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,740
little fucking kettlebell crawl,
little bag,

970
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,420
my backyard just to get that hip thing 
going.

971
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,030
So I laid this fertile,
glossy stuff.

972
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,520
No,
I decided like somebody told me to crawl

973
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:27,080
and I started crying like,
you're in the army,

974
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,790
like in get back yard.
I started crawling.

975
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,490
I fucking love around your yard.
Yeah,

976
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,970
just crawl around for yourself

977
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,060
when your hips.
This shit.

978
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:36,120
Do all this shit on your elbows.
I like it.

979
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:38,290
So I've been doing that,
but when the gym's install,

980
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:39,900
the gym's going to be installed here in 
two weeks.

981
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:41,370
You got to come by and we'll do a 
workout.

982
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,030
Want you to teach me the Doris and all 
that stuff?

983
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,920
Half guard and all that stuff.
Okay,

984
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,000
great.
Sure.

985
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,090
That's great that you got this place.
This is a fucking big place.

986
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,350
Crazy place,
right?

987
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,740
But it's this place.
We're going to do all kinds of stuff 

988
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:57,740
here.
We're gonna.

989
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,920
Have it set up where people could follow
along workouts.

990
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,480
I'm going to get someone to like guide 
us through a workout and I'll say,

991
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,110
hey,
everybody,

992
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:06,600
grab a 35 pound Kettlebell.
We're going to go through this.

993
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,670
Like that Keith Weber guy that I've had 
on before,

994
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:14,030
Keith Weber.
I'll get him to come up here and teach 

995
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:14,030
that extreme Kettlebell,
extreme cardio workouts.

996
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,260
Fucking phenomenal workout that you 
could do with 1:35

997
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:18,800
pound Kettlebell and you'll pick up a 35
pound Kettlebell.

998
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,840
You want to fucking workout,
I'm going to get with this little that 

999
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:23,840
does it.
Five minutes and you'll be dying.

1000
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,200
Guaranteed.
One hundred percent.

1001
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:27,900
Even if you're in good shape,
it's hard if you're not used to.

1002
00:45:27,901 --> 00:45:32,901
That workout is fucking hard and by the 
time the things over my legs are on 

1003
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:33,600
fire.
Thirty five pounds,

1004
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,480
35 pounds.
What kind of Shit are you doing?

1005
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,090
Like,
oh,

1006
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,510
clean presses over and over again.
Hot potatoes,

1007
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:42,120
back and forth,
renegade rows.

1008
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,270
You're doing like one pushup with one 
hand on the Kettlebell switch to the 

1009
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,820
other side.
Push up with the other one doing.

1010
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:50,400
I'm passing in between your legs and you
go one after the other,

1011
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:52,410
one after the other windmills over and 
over.

1012
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:55,920
Cleaned press snatches,
and you're doing these in succession.

1013
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,510
Over and over again.
Switch to this side.

1014
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,540
Switch to the other side,
10 on this side,

1015
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,220
10 on that side.
You know,

1016
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:06,330
and it's,
we're talking about like a 45 minute 

1017
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:06,330
workout.
We have them.

1018
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:06,540
You can,
you could buy them all over the place,

1019
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:09,420
but we have him on it.
He's got three of them out,

1020
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:12,990
three different workouts.
They're fucking crazy dvds.

1021
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,130
I mean this,
this guy is,

1022
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,910
he's a trainer up in Canada.
It's just in tremendous shape,

1023
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:22,911
but the videos are so good because it's 
one of the few videos where a lot of 

1024
00:46:22,911 --> 00:46:25,290
these kettlebell workout videos like 
people were teaching you proper form,

1025
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,360
which is all important.
You know,

1026
00:46:26,361 --> 00:46:28,350
it's real important to like learn proper
form,

1027
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,840
learn where to peep to keep the weight 
balanced,

1028
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,020
keep your weight in your heels and your 
feet flat on the ground.

1029
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:39,021
All the different things that they want 
you to stress about various individual 

1030
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:39,021
movements.

1031
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:43,580
But Keith Weber's like,
you better know all that shit because 

1032
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:43,740
we're just going to take you through a 
radical workout like ready?

1033
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:44,820
Here we go.
Boom.

1034
00:46:44,821 --> 00:46:46,380
And he does.
He's doing it all with you.

1035
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,170
He's doing it on the beach.
It's awesome and crazy shit.

1036
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,030
The other guy's good too,
from a burden.

1037
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,060
He's good too.
He's got a nice little workout in the 

1038
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,060
mornings that.
Oh yeah,

1039
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,280
that's kettle Jitsu guys.
That guy up at 5:30

1040
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,500
AM,
5:30

1041
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,580
AM.
I watched it online.

1042
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,650
Five 30 am,
5:30

1043
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,840
AM.
He's got like fucking stack of people in

1044
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:05,670
there.
They go right to Jujitsu.

1045
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,670
It's how great will it be?
The show up?

1046
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,730
I gotta get up at three Am.
Yeah,

1047
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,640
be ready at 5:30
for that type of shit.

1048
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,450
Have coffee.
I got to have coffee,

1049
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:20,451
smoke pot.
I have a protein shake right a little 

1050
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:20,451
bit.
Just so not the thing.

1051
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:21,100
I get fired up.
I can't.

1052
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,610
I'll have a heart attack.
I just can't get up and go over there.

1053
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,790
The good thing about doing a workout 
like that before Jujitsu is that you'll 

1054
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,860
approach Jujitsu like light.

1055
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,350
Is this him kettle Jitsu?
Yeah.

1056
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:37,351
He's got a,
a good program like he's doing hip 

1057
00:47:37,351 --> 00:47:40,291
escapes is call it snake moves while 
he's holding onto a Kettlebell at the 

1058
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:40,570
same time.
That's phenomenal for your core.

1059
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,080
He's a rocking chair.
Get ups.

1060
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,440
You know what I really like,
man.

1061
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:45,320
I do.
Um,

1062
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:49,210
these sit ups with kettlebells or I put 
a 2:55

1063
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:52,750
pound kettle bells or 50 pound kettle 
bells a over my feet.

1064
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,020
I put my feet through the handles and 
then I put two in my hands and I lay 

1065
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,941
back on my back and I press them up and 
then I sit up with impressed up and I do

1066
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,840
my sit ups that way and it just makes 
your core,

1067
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:07,510
your,
your ab muscles just so God damn strong.

1068
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,740
Twenty five you give me.
I don't tie my feet and what I do is I 

1069
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,600
go back and then we'll go this way.

1070
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,290
I do like a fucking burpee.
Oh,

1071
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,750
okay.
No,

1072
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,330
that's great.
I grew up on my back,

1073
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:22,220
but I do that and then stand back up all
the way up.

1074
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,140
No,
no,

1075
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,540
I just bull Bam.
Go back in the band,

1076
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,710
but at least it's like getting onto the 
table.

1077
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:35,180
That's what getting into a table.
I wanted to the strength and all that 

1078
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,500
shit and that helped me strengthen my 
back doing that stuff.

1079
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,620
Those are great workouts because they're
not.

1080
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,020
It's not like a glamorous thing where 
pumps you up,

1081
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,880
gives you a big.
It makes it look Jack,

1082
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:46,090
but it's just great for your 
circulation.

1083
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,580
Then I told her the bag in the.
Oh yeah,

1084
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,670
showed a warm up.
I opened up with the bag very lightly.

1085
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,370
Pry minutes,
close distance than spread out punches.

1086
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,190
Just get everything moving,
pushup stretched.

1087
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:02,250
Once you do 20 minutes at Dan,
I started doing my stretches to really 

1088
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:02,380
get the muscles are warm.

1089
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:07,740
Then I go back,
now I start throwing kicks that kills 

1090
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:07,800
Uncle Joey.
Once I start throwing the Kix,

1091
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:10,810
Kix kix sixth and like crawl.
But I do make cleans.

1092
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:15,811
I do all the stuff with a 15 pounds and 
now it's still using the kettle bells 

1093
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,980
swings that we're in the middle of my 
back.

1094
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,520
I used to fifteens I turned my arms,
go up,

1095
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,380
boom.
Catch him.

1096
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,700
Oh,
so you're raising the club's got them 

1097
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:27,700
from onnit man,
they,

1098
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,870
they're fucking great.
Do you,

1099
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:30,550
uh,
do you ever do Turkish getups?

1100
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:35,170
I do up to a degree too.
So I take the 10,

1101
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,360
whatever it is,
boom,

1102
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,410
boom,
boom.

1103
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,900
And then I do like a table instead of 
getting.

1104
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,310
Okay,
well that's good.

1105
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:42,880
Yeah.
No,

1106
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,200
no,
no.

1107
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,020
Yeah,
no,

1108
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:47,980
no I do it that.
I like all that stuff.

1109
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,740
Any of that stuff.
Like when you're lying down on your back

1110
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:53,290
and you're pressing something up and 
even just getting up to your knee,

1111
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,810
it's all just about strengthening your 
core,

1112
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:56,290
you know?

1113
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:01,650
Do you do anything for your legs?
Do you do like bodyweight squats for 

1114
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:01,650
your legs?
Squats,

1115
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,070
the goblets.
You don't have to do it with your,

1116
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,440
with the way to do it.
I do.

1117
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,470
I start with nothing.
And then I worked myself up to a 35 

1118
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,470
goblet.
Uh,

1119
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,040
and then I do,
you know what man?

1120
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,590
My knees are kind of.
Yeah.

1121
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:15,150
You've always had some knee issues,
right?

1122
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,290
The left one,
the right one now is a little funky.

1123
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:20,020
So I,
I stopped with the swings.

1124
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,200
I love cleans with kettlebells.
That's my shit.

1125
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,100
So I liked the combination.
Clean my hand down squat.

1126
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,770
Oh,
those are great.

1127
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,830
That's what I do.
Another clean squat and I do five on 

1128
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,171
each side.
Nobody run you through a program or do 

1129
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:35,390
you just come up with this on your own?
Wherever I've worked with,

1130
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,660
I was going to take the door off and 
then got and then just decided to do 

1131
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:40,660
whatever you want.

1132
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,940
Alberto is there,
my wife got me a bag for Christmas.

1133
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,720
I got two kettlebells from you.
Do you want to join us if we do some 

1134
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,530
sort of a challenge,
some next level challenge,

1135
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,140
some next thing you want to join in,
which you do like.

1136
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:54,890
No,
no,

1137
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,530
no,
no.

1138
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,690
I'm just thinking.
I just.

1139
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,700
This is one of the things that I've 
realized from this,

1140
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:04,080
doing the 15 yoga classes,
I would fucking never do nine yoga 

1141
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,410
classes in a row like that.
I would never do nine days in a row.

1142
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:11,430
And last I said I was going to do it,
but once you say you're going to do 

1143
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,500
something and you do it,
it's not that hard.

1144
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,210
You just,
you just wind up doing it,

1145
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,570
you know,
like you have to do it.

1146
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,830
Like my alarm goes off at seven,
I'm out the door,

1147
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,950
I get to the class,
I do the fucking 90 minute class and 

1148
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,681
then I'm done and then I'd go do my shit
and then I know the next day when I'm 

1149
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:26,681
getting.

1150
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:27,740
It doesn't matter if I get home from the
store at 1:00

1151
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:30,020
in the morning,
my alarms going off at seven,

1152
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,130
I'm getting up,
I'm having a cup of coffee.

1153
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,060
I go there fast and I just have coffee.
You work out early?

1154
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,100
Yeah,
I didn't like getting up and work.

1155
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,500
I'm good at,
but whoever the twelfth.

1156
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,630
I have 11:00
podcasts a lot of times.

1157
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,370
Like today's 11:00
podcast,

1158
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:45,140
so I'm up.
You know,

1159
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,110
I already got a 90 minute workout in.
I come here,

1160
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,480
you know,
stop at like a whole foods or something 

1161
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:53,480
like that.
Get a coconut milk,

1162
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:59,140
eat something good to get the coconut 
milk mental that mix it with the asa 

1163
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,170
even though Jesus Christ,
it's delicious.

1164
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,850
Couple ice cubes.
Yeah.

1165
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,370
I never liked the ISI even though,
but they ran out.

1166
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,960
They started sending somebody that.
I'm like,

1167
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,420
beggars can't be choosy.
Good.

1168
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:09,160
Google we google.

1169
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,700
It's very good.
It's very good.

1170
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:15,810
You know.
Then the good thing about that hemp 

1171
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:16,480
force protein is it's very little sugar 
commscope.

1172
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,820
Couple grams of sugar per coconut milk.
No,

1173
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,040
I like it.
I liked that one.

1174
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,430
I don't mind doing the challenge.
Here's the problem,

1175
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,840
Joe Rogan.
Here's the problem.

1176
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:28,580
What happens that a lot of people don't 
realize?

1177
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,110
I go to Jujitsu,
right?

1178
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,800
Let's say I go to Alberto's.
Alberto's has some fucking killers in 

1179
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,070
there,
so I'll do the break.

1180
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,300
The guard,
pass the guard,

1181
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:43,630
right?
A couple of those and then we start 

1182
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,581
rolling.
Will a guy like me and an older guy 

1183
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:46,070
starts rolling that for the second five 
minute roll.

1184
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:48,050
He's opened up.
He's,

1185
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:48,740
Oh,
I'm open.

1186
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,380
Like I called dolce,
which my problem,

1187
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,320
how come I'm not breathing?
He goes,

1188
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,500
you know what?
I got to work them out in the back for 

1189
00:52:59,500 --> 00:52:59,500
45 minutes before.

1190
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,110
Because they can't breathe either.
It's just,

1191
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,840
just go with it.
So if I do more than those two roles is.

1192
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:07,580
So law diminishing returns,
I really can't walk the next day.

1193
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,450
It's,
it's hard,

1194
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,250
but you got to build up to it.
You've got to build up to it.

1195
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:13,130
So that's what I'm.
That's why I liked the southern guy in a

1196
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:16,040
way.
Because you work one day,

1197
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:18,470
you drill,
you know what day you work.

1198
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:23,300
I could do a wait shit,
like I like wait shit.

1199
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:26,630
I was thinking of joining your buddy's 
gym for a really good workout.

1200
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,370
Tyree norris.
Terry.

1201
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,650
Uh,
if that's the one in studio city or 

1202
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:33,650
Barry North.
Terry claim on.

1203
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,920
There's a Terry Clay bond.
Is the guy who used to train with WHO's 

1204
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,460
in Hollywood?
A former boxer.

1205
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:38,860
Yeah,
he's in.

1206
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,720
He's in.
He's in.

1207
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:40,830
He's in Burbank.
His,

1208
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:44,590
he really fuck it.
He has a group on for like 30 visits for

1209
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,830
teaching people how to box.

1210
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,030
Terry Norris was a mother fucker little 
corner store.

1211
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:56,031
It's up to quarter from a,
it's up to quarter from a famous 

1212
00:53:56,031 --> 00:54:00,381
bodybuilding gym,
but it's right there up the corner from 

1213
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:04,100
this fucking great restaurant at that 
breakfast restaurant and he's right 

1214
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:04,980
there.
How is he like talking and everything?

1215
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:07,680
His yard because they had a thing on him
on television.

1216
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,930
He's having some issues.
I pick his wife.

1217
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:12,840
Is there somebody else there?
But he's had cause.

1218
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,460
Yeah.
She said that.

1219
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:16,320
It's interesting because like he said 
all these issues,

1220
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:18,510
but then once he starts hitting the bag 
and he's brand new,

1221
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,910
he comes back and he looks like Terry 
Norris of old.

1222
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:24,300
It's just talk in and struggling,
you know,

1223
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,310
he just,
I remember seeing him once,

1224
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,280
um,
I was at a boxing match.

1225
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,710
I was actually with dom irrera and Terry
nars too.

1226
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:34,560
They're talking to people and this is 
before he had had retired,

1227
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,340
like officially.

1228
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,310
And uh,
he was talking to somebody and you could

1229
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:40,620
hear the slurring and I was like,
whoa.

1230
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,690
Like I had no idea,
no idea.

1231
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:44,480
It was this bad,
you know,

1232
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,280
all those guys,
those guys that are in wars,

1233
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,300
like,
you'll,

1234
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,590
you will run into them one day and you 
will see it all and see the war in their

1235
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:55,020
voice.
You'll see it in the slurring and the,

1236
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,600
the,
the weird ticks and the movements.

1237
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:58,170
And you're like,
oh,

1238
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,630
you're looking at a,
a frazzled person there.

1239
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,980
You know,
they're shattered to Jamie show you the 

1240
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,091
hit from last night.
The one you watch the football last 

1241
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:08,091
night.
Oh No,

1242
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:11,210
what happened?
Somebody gets smashed or uh,

1243
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,420
but you know what's crazy?
This was football thing years ago now 

1244
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,680
that fucking done like that.
I hit this hard anymore though.

1245
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:20,840
You can't.
Well,

1246
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,960
how'd this guy get hit so hard?

1247
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,610
Yeah.
So the,

1248
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,080
the main issue on it,
as I could say,

1249
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:28,200
a quarterback play,
they do the thing where they are,

1250
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,660
I guess they're called Kit.
It's giving up their body.

1251
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,700
They slide with their legs first.
They're not supposed to get hit,

1252
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:38,490
like in almost anywhere.
Maybe supposed to tap them just to like 

1253
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:38,620
let another down.
Um,

1254
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:43,670
so this guy gives up his legs.
Let me see if I can find the video to 

1255
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,670
try and that while I'm talking.
But uh,

1256
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,020
he gets hit really,
really hard.

1257
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:51,050
And then when you see it in slow Mo,
it kind of makes it a little worse 

1258
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:51,530
because the dude lead with design arm to
them right in the home.

1259
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,190
Oh,
it goes like this job you seeing,

1260
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,410
you're like,
damn,

1261
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,600
I'm surprised that.
And throw them out.

1262
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,720
Like I didn't watch the game when I got 
up this morning.

1263
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:02,970
It was all over the place at late.
It laid it.

1264
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,050
I wonder if one day they're going to be 
able to figure this.

1265
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,090
Is it right here?
Yeah.

1266
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,310
Here we go.
Running Tome.

1267
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:14,350
Oh Jesus.
Why is that Guy Mad?

1268
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:15,400
Because it's a late hit.

1269
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,270
They got furious at them.

1270
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,950
Say it again.
They'll say they're going to show it 

1271
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,950
from other angles and you'll see

1272
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,850
technic quarterbacks a big deal.
That's the guy that hit him.

1273
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,650
40 seven.
Kiki Alonzo.

1274
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:29,980
I thinks his name.
Kiko.

1275
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,600
That's the guy who got hit.
Joe Flacco for the Ravens.

1276
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,370
Here we go.
He's running.

1277
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,090
He's running.

1278
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,620
This is the angle for.

1279
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,010
Well,
he was already coming like,

1280
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,060
how's he going to stop it?
Stop.

1281
00:56:45,061 --> 00:56:47,010
That's the part about the slide.
Feet first.

1282
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,530
That's going to be like you're supposed 
to stop.

1283
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,990
It's like kicking a fighter when their 
arms are down kind of thing.

1284
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:56,991
It's a rough time.
Like I know that they changed the rule 

1285
00:56:56,991 --> 00:56:56,991
recently,
but I'm sort of same kind of thing where

1286
00:56:56,991 --> 00:56:59,220
he hit that dude.
Even though the dude was already down,

1287
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:03,370
the guy went down on his own accord.
He lets him sliding feet first.

1288
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:05,010
I mean he's not supposed to be hitting 
him like that.

1289
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:07,170
He should know better is what that is.
Why everyone was mad.

1290
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,630
That's why these coaches yelling.
He just took a cheap shot at him.

1291
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,380
Yeah,
exactly.

1292
00:57:10,381 --> 00:57:12,330
And he hit him really hard,
knocked him right out of the game.

1293
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,080
So what happens to that guy?
Forty seven.

1294
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,440
He gets a fine.
Yeah.

1295
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,220
That dude's spread that for three or 
four games.

1296
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,410
He got his bell rung.
Yeah.

1297
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:24,120
That's a fucked up thing,
right?

1298
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,110
In College football.
They're taking them.

1299
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,670
They're taking them out of the game 
right away.

1300
00:57:28,671 --> 00:57:30,980
He would have been probably thrown 
directly out of the game,

1301
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,170
potentially.
Ms Dot Moore,

1302
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,720
maybe half the next game.
And so they give a penalty to the other 

1303
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:37,720
team.
Yeah.

1304
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,480
So in the NFL right now it's just a 
penalty.

1305
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:44,540
Football referees are on the take.
How many of these guys get busted?

1306
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,400
Like that's a big thing about NBA 
players.

1307
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:51,401
I was reading this whole thing about how
little NBA players make and how they're 

1308
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,940
constantly watched all these MBA or not 
mba players,

1309
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:57,941
NBA referees,
me and other watching all these players 

1310
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,491
pull up and bentleys and rolls royces 
and shining with diamonds and gold and 

1311
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:05,831
jewelry and that these guys just start 
taking bribes and that there is one 

1312
00:58:06,591 --> 00:58:11,591
point in time where there's just a 
shitload of referees in the NFL and the 

1313
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:15,911
NBA that are just on the take and they,
they'll get bribed by bookies.

1314
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,750
They'll get bribed by people that are 
big time gamblers.

1315
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,060
And you've got to think,
if this guy's only making,

1316
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,800
I mean,
how much does a referee make?

1317
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:29,090
So somewhere between anywhere between 
150 and 500,000.

1318
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,300
That's a good living with someone comes 
to you.

1319
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,950
If you make 115,
someone comes to me,

1320
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:34,560
he goes,
Joey,

1321
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,930
just want you to make this game a little
bit more easy for the dolphins.

1322
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,190
Here's a hundred acres.
How much they make per group per year.

1323
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:45,380
And some players there make that per 
game.

1324
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,540
Now pull up,
um,

1325
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,920
bribery in NBA referees or corruption.
And NBA referees,

1326
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,900
it's been a bunch of guys that had been 
busted.

1327
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:58,880
Right?
I don't know about a bunch.

1328
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:00,950
I think it's really just the one guy,
just one.

1329
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,510
He tried to call out a bunch of other 
people,

1330
00:59:02,511 --> 00:59:05,760
but he didn't do it by name,
who I talked to them.

1331
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:08,510
That guy did.
You guys know shit.

1332
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,630
What'd he say?
He's a good guy.

1333
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:15,620
He's just a fucking listen.
You fall into that trap.

1334
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,640
They have so many scams.
Like he was telling me they got like the

1335
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:21,430
first class tickets,
shit [inaudible],

1336
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,150
you know,

1337
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:25,270
where they give you a first class ticket
to travel to a games is so much.

1338
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,050
Just a little bit of this,
a little bit of this,

1339
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,390
a little bit of that,
you know.

1340
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:32,840
Well there was always a lot of that with
boxing as well in college basketball,

1341
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:37,841
just like this is a tremendous coaches 
and some different programs and I think 

1342
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,820
it was adidas might've been.
So they were playing.

1343
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:46,390
Families were getting paid through the 
shoe companies to direct players to 

1344
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:51,611
certain schools and then they were 
getting signed by those companies when 

1345
00:59:51,611 --> 00:59:53,870
they made it to the NBA.
And in some cases,

1346
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:58,871
I think Rick Pitino,
who the coach for Louisville is taking 

1347
00:59:58,871 --> 01:00:01,301
something like 98 percent or 95 percent 
of the money that was due to the school 

1348
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:03,050
from Adidas.
He was just keeping it all.

1349
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,330
What?
Yeah,

1350
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,280
what?
No,

1351
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,650
uh,
yeah.

1352
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,760
I don't know.
Legal is a weird word on that.

1353
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,760
I mean it's in the contract and it was 
like cash and paying him basically.

1354
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:22,400
Yes.
If you go back to the movie blue chips,

1355
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,680
which came out a long time ago,
it's all being.

1356
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:28,620
It was like fictional then,
but it's been going on for the last $25.

1357
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,200
Why would they pay him?
Like what do they,

1358
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,600
what do they get if adidas wants to like
what,

1359
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:37,610
what does the deed is get out of it?
He's bringing in the most popular 

1360
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,140
players that are going to be like most 
popular recruits from highschool and Aau

1361
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,000
and so that maybe he could bring them to
adidas and then Adidas.

1362
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,590
You have them all in the final for the 
NCAA tournament.

1363
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:46,910
They're going to be on Saturday 
basketball.

1364
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:48,770
They're getting advertised just like NBA
players,

1365
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:53,320
but they're not getting the money.
They're getting their names in lights,

1366
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:54,590
you know,
they're all over sports center,

1367
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,590
so they essentially would adidas would 
pay him to be an influencer.

1368
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,400
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

1369
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,750
Wow,
that's weird.

1370
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:04,751
That's a weird role.
So he would be the father figure or the 

1371
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,650
coach figure to these young men.
They look up to him.

1372
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:08,600
He's a mentor in some ways on it.
Yeah,

1373
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:11,540
definitely.
And he wheezes them into the adidas fold

1374
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,030
and data what they want that they want 
to wear.

1375
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:15,490
Adidas cluff stuff.
Yeah.

1376
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,090
They want that.
The cool jerseys.

1377
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:22,091
They're make Ohio state right now.
The team I'm pay pay attention to for 

1378
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:24,971
football,
have some awesome crazy jerseys that 

1379
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:27,551
nobody's ever going to get that like the
Lebron James Brand of Nike is giving 

1380
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,270
them that are going to be showcased all 
over TV Saturday.

1381
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:30,830
I was reading it

1382
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:35,830
about under armour is banking on Steph 
Curry's new under armour shoe.

1383
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,900
Good luck.
Oh Wow.

1384
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,230
Jamie so much.
There were saying that steph curry,

1385
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,760
who's like one of the best players in 
the league,

1386
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:46,430
apparently you know that more than I do,
I don't know shit about basketball.

1387
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,100
They were saying that his new under our 
Mushu there,

1388
01:01:51,101 --> 01:01:56,101
they're putting a lot of money into this
idea that his shoe is going to rebound 

1389
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:02,171
the stock.
So people are making recommendations to 

1390
01:02:02,171 --> 01:02:02,690
buy under armour stock now so that when 
the shoe comes out,

1391
01:02:02,691 --> 01:02:06,650
everybody gets crazy and buys his shoe 
and then under armour will bounce back.

1392
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,130
Um,
you know,

1393
01:02:08,131 --> 01:02:11,280
the problem is once,
once something has a stink about it,

1394
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,980
that's kind of it,
you know,

1395
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,360
that is that bad looking in my opinion.
And from knowing what I know about 

1396
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,091
sneakers,
that's not shoe that's going to bring 

1397
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:23,091
them back.
Why?

1398
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:24,420
What's wrong with that shoe?
I lost a bunch of kids are into it,

1399
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,810
which I don't know that they would be.
It's more about marketing.

1400
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,110
So you have to get a whole bunch of kids
into buying that.

1401
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:35,460
And then there's got to be a couple of 
influencers in the like Mba,

1402
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,190
video game world,
and uh,

1403
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:42,230
like the youtube blogging world that are
going to have to make this seem cool to 

1404
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,890
them.
Was the influence.

1405
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:46,950
What does it say Steph curry on it?
Is that 30 is number?

1406
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:47,970
Oh,
it looks like an SC,

1407
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:49,410
doesn't it?
I mean,

1408
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,320
I guess I wouldn't wear these shoes is 
all.

1409
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:55,440
I have so much fucking money in the 
sneaker business.

1410
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,650
You wouldn't wear those shoes.
You wear those goofy looking yeezys.

1411
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,720
I also like,
I wouldn't wear these casually.

1412
01:03:00,721 --> 01:03:02,310
I'm not playing basketball.
Do you need a tissue?

1413
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,640
So if some people might be wearing this 
for basketball,

1414
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:07,320
there are a lot of kids still playing 
basketball.

1415
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:12,590
If they can get a team into buying them,
then you get 15 pairs sold that to a 

1416
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,410
team and you're talking about two 
totally different worlds,

1417
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:15,360
right?
You're talking about there's people that

1418
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:20,361
buy shoes to wear to play in casual or.
And then there's people that buy shoes 

1419
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:22,170
just to hang out in.
Correct?

1420
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:23,550
Yep.
And they're doing them.

1421
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,730
They're buying athletic shoes for 
hanging out purposes.

1422
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:28,480
Right.
And these,

1423
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:33,740
the marketing of it is a real weird 
place because Jordan's are where it all 

1424
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:37,761
started.
Michael Jordan got everybody wearing 

1425
01:03:37,761 --> 01:03:37,761
shoes,
you know?

1426
01:03:37,761 --> 01:03:40,340
Yeah.
And Jordan's people don't play 

1427
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:40,510
basketball and Jordans,
correct or no?

1428
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,100
They don't.
Yeah,

1429
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:43,460
they don't do it because you look cool 
when you were a Jew.

1430
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,980
You're wearing those fucking cool 
Jordan's.

1431
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:45,450
Yeah.
Oh.

1432
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:47,790
So if you wear Jordan's playing 
basketball,

1433
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:52,791
like this guy is so fucking crazy.
He's playing basketball and George or 

1434
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:52,791
even.
Yeah,

1435
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:56,931
like he's playing basketball and that 
thousand dollar Retro Jordans that cost 

1436
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:57,630
a thousand dollars.
Some of them do.

1437
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,200
Oh wait.
Yes,

1438
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,150
really?
I mean brand new retail.

1439
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:05,370
They're costing about 100 to 200.
Not 100,

1440
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:08,610
200 bucks retail.
But the rarity of them,

1441
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,500
especially depending on the year they 
came out,

1442
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,520
if they came out five years ago,
they,

1443
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,760
some of them cost a thousand bucks,
2000 bucks.

1444
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:19,761
Not to associate with geese or whatever.
I get like a cheap g take out those 

1445
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:23,800
shoulder roll.
What do you call those show role?

1446
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,760
Yeah.
People wait on line for those limit.

1447
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:31,820
They made a Michael Jordan won.
They made them a guy that don't do 

1448
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:35,181
Jujitsu.
They put a gay out of Michael Jordan g 

1449
01:04:35,181 --> 01:04:37,920
that they sold in Chicago.
I know a guy that buys all those skis,

1450
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:40,500
like they do the same thing,
like lucky limited time.

1451
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:44,520
Only midnight.
They have hundreds of geese.

1452
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,590
Do not wear really just the shoulder 
rolls to show you rose.

1453
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:54,060
I don't know exactly what they gained 
that I don't fucking know.

1454
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,290
I like that Dr Stuff.
Yeah,

1455
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,620
those are great that that.
That gives you still wear it.

1456
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:04,550
It is nice.
It's.

1457
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:09,551
It's real durable too because the hemp 
is just so much more durable than 

1458
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:09,990
cotton.
It's just those things.

1459
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:11,100
I mean,
keys are pretty.

1460
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:16,101
God Damn durable as it is.
It usually takes a long time for one 

1461
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:17,230
starts to break.
Unless you have a single.

1462
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:17,800
We've,
you know,

1463
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:17,980
one of

1464
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,710
those thin light ones.
Summer food chips.

1465
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,110
Great.
I love just doing all the mats for.

1466
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,090
Are they?
Yeah.

1467
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,300
Love food.
Geez.

1468
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:28,570
I got the white one.
The black one that you could pull them.

1469
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,820
I'm a gorilla in that thing,
but they.

1470
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,090
I knew I wouldn't.
This is why I knew I wouldn't do well in

1471
01:05:34,091 --> 01:05:35,360
hot yoga.
First of all,

1472
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:36,130
I'm not.
I eat guy.

1473
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,250
You could tell how I even humidity.
I don't respond well to.

1474
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:45,120
When I first started Jujitsu,
that was the biggest problem I had that 

1475
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,900
I didn't know anything about geese,
so I went and bought a Judogi.

1476
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:50,230
That heat,
that heat level went all the way up.

1477
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:51,690
That took me to a different place.
Yeah,

1478
01:05:51,691 --> 01:05:54,760
those double weave ds,
like those things.

1479
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,980
Those are very heavy,
but some people liked that.

1480
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:03,190
They liked the double weave.
They like the feeling of security of 

1481
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,640
having that very thick cloth around 
them.

1482
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,850
Some people like that golden weave.
I like the single.

1483
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:10,250
We've this summer,
the fucking thing.

1484
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,750
I want it to feel light.
I don't want to fucking get.

1485
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:15,600
You don't look at the size of me.
If I put again,

1486
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,080
it's 20 pounds,
but also for me,

1487
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:17,810
I.
I've been.

1488
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,430
How about staff a couple times,
so I always put a rash guard on anyway.

1489
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:26,670
Even if I were a rash guard on,
I just don't see people get scratched 

1490
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:31,160
from fingernails all the time and I also
carried those defense soap,

1491
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,420
the white spray,
the soap.

1492
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:37,720
I got the soap in the shower,
put them on my fucking feet,

1493
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,790
my drink.
Do you drink Kombucha?

1494
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,060
That's so good.
Again,

1495
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:45,280
probiotics.
Do you ever have Kimchi?

1496
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,710
Kimchi.
That's where she can't tell shit.

1497
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:51,070
Smells fucking disgusting.
I love that stuff.

1498
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,830
Even though it says I'm Asian,
the fucking thing.

1499
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,920
I buy a fucking jar that shit like a 32 
ounce jar and I eat most of the Jones 

1500
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,390
Kimchi.
Like a fucking cabbage.

1501
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,270
It's pickled cabbage.
It's fermented cabbage from Korea.

1502
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,640
You fart smell worse than they'll clean 
the paint off your fucking car.

1503
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:14,020
Fucking Christ.
I like to camp the juice.

1504
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:17,440
I just can't deal with other shit.
All that stuff is good for you.

1505
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:20,170
I don't do the Greek yogurt or regular 
yogurt.

1506
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:21,490
Greek yogurt.
Tastes like ass.

1507
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,940
Fuck that.
I tried the Vanilla,

1508
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,270
the Plain Greek yogurt.
No,

1509
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,040
I like the Dan.
I like all the other ones.

1510
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:30,880
You know.
Well,

1511
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,720
over the last few months I've been 
shying away from from dairy.

1512
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,960
I've been,
I'll eat a little cheese every now and 

1513
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,941
then because I like cheese,
but I've been trying to eliminate dairy 

1514
01:07:41,941 --> 01:07:44,731
from my diet a little bit just to see 
because I've heard from several people 

1515
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,300
that they've eliminated dairy and 
they've had good reactions.

1516
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:51,301
Their body,
they fed like less inflammation and it 

1517
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:51,301
makes them feel better.
I'm that shit that sending that report.

1518
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:54,460
I'm lactose intolerant.
I don't drink milk.

1519
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I drink a milkshake once a month.
I'll drink a milkshake and make a banana

1520
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:03,400
shake at home or something like that.
My shakes then,

1521
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:06,970
so I think that's what I'm going to do 
for November.

1522
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:08,680
I'm trying to figure out what I'm going 
to do for November,

1523
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:13,681
but I think for November I'm going to go
the entire month without eating any 

1524
01:08:13,681 --> 01:08:14,470
bullshit.
One hundred percent the entire month.

1525
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:16,160
Just all healthy food.

1526
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,000
No added sugar?
No,

1527
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,820
no nothing.
No Sodas,

1528
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:25,300
no crap.
I'm just going to see what that feels 

1529
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,881
like.
I'm just saying we gotta we're going to 

1530
01:08:27,881 --> 01:08:28,100
come up with some new challenge because 
after this month doing this,

1531
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:30,260
I feel like this was a very beneficial 
month for me.

1532
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:35,210
Beneficial in that first of all,
my back has never felt better.

1533
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:40,290
Like doing yoga all these times.
Like it makes your backfield 

1534
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,661
bulletproof.
Like you just feel like my posture and 

1535
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:43,661
everything.
Like everything is just.

1536
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:48,790
It feels so sturdy because yoga,
especially [inaudible] like that 90 

1537
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:53,501
minute hot yoga shits.
So much of it is about your back and 

1538
01:08:53,501 --> 01:08:53,870
your core and like supporting your 
spine.

1539
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:55,470
And I think,
uh,

1540
01:08:55,490 --> 01:09:00,490
you know,
sitting down a lot doing podcast even 

1541
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:01,490
though these chairs are phenomenal,
these Pisco Ergo depot chairs,

1542
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:06,760
these things are phenomenal.
They keep you sitting in the right 

1543
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:06,760
posture and their support.

1544
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:11,200
You well,
she's not real good to sit down all the 

1545
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,141
time like that.
And a lot of times your back is 

1546
01:09:14,141 --> 01:09:16,480
compressed and if you don't have good 
structure and if you don't have good 

1547
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,591
strength around the spine,
like good muscle strength around the 

1548
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:24,281
spine,
you're going to develop all sorts of 

1549
01:09:24,281 --> 01:09:24,281
weird problems and weird,
weird issues with your back.

1550
01:09:24,281 --> 01:09:29,111
But I think um,
I've learned a lot and this month about 

1551
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,610
like what,
what kind of exercises you need to do to

1552
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:34,010
keep your back strong,
you know,

1553
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:37,970
like this yoga shit,
like doing it as many times as we did it

1554
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:38,870
this month.
I mean,

1555
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:43,871
I'm not going to do it this many times,
but I'm definitely going to do it two 

1556
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:43,871
times a week from now on.

1557
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:46,120
Definitely because if you mix it with 
the weights,

1558
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:47,620
a little run and you can,
can go,

1559
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,880
Yep,
you're good to go.

1560
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,600
You don't need much if we're not going 
to the Olympics.

1561
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,120
Right.
We're not fucking trying to maintain,

1562
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,840
to maintain.
Keep your fucking whatever going.

1563
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,490
That's all.
It's not a lot.

1564
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,640
Have you ever done the cryotherapy?
Cryotherapy,

1565
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,800
the cold shit.
Yeah.

1566
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:07,180
I worked myself up,
but it's right around the corner from my

1567
01:10:07,181 --> 01:10:08,410
house.
Have you done it?

1568
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,380
No,
I just always forget to go down.

1569
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,330
It's phenomenal.
I think I had a lot of problems.

1570
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,410
You know,
I wrote A.

1571
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:19,470
I wrote the fucking whatever the first 
four chapters for the book.

1572
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:22,830
For your book.
Yeah,

1573
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,520
that's what I did.
August and September.

1574
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:27,820
Which what are you writing a book about?
What got me into comedy?

1575
01:10:27,821 --> 01:10:30,460
Where I got the.
Just the biography?

1576
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,530
Yeah.
Hey,

1577
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,280
this and that.

1578
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:35,740
Finally started August first.
I got the IPAD whenever the IPAD.

1579
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,600
We write it on an IPAD.
Fuck.

1580
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:38,740
Yeah.
And I ride it.

1581
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:41,650
Hire the kid and he edits everything 
from me.

1582
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,930
Oh yeah.
So I had to have four chapters done.

1583
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,760
I got to tell you something.
So you have a book deal.

1584
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,660
Dumb to try to join us.
Yeah.

1585
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,900
I wanted to write it bro.
And I wanted to write.

1586
01:10:49,901 --> 01:10:51,950
I didn't want to say every time I had 
somebody else write it.

1587
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:57,510
Joey Diaz is like a floyd story.
You should have seen the last guy story 

1588
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:00,940
floyd story and whatever the fuck those 
people have no fucking story and story.

1589
01:11:00,941 --> 01:11:02,920
Who's floating?
I have no fucking idea.

1590
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,240
People,
you know,

1591
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:08,020
be no writing has gotten like when you 
read salad to the lands,

1592
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,570
right?
It's just plain writing,

1593
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:16,140
but sometimes you read these books with 
the go a little too far with that 

1594
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:16,140
bullshit.

1595
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,860
You know what I'm saying?
Like whatever.

1596
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,310
It's just too much.
It's like you were saying you have to go

1597
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:23,610
to people's houses and they talk and 
then say shift for 20 minutes.

1598
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,520
Then it's like by studio city where I 
live,

1599
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:28,680
go to that coffee shop from time to 
time.

1600
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:31,530
You know what they were saying in there 
the day after the Vegas shooter,

1601
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,940
the Vegas shooter was Sunday night.
Do you know what these idiots Hussein in

1602
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:38,130
there Monday,
but that this had to do a woman's rights

1603
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,700
and abortions and they just talk these 
new lists.

1604
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,580
No breather gentiles.
They just talk.

1605
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:48,330
That's all they do is talk with big 
words to impress you.

1606
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,390
But they don't say shit.
Don't say shit.

1607
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:57,830
Three or four big words to let you know 
they're smart and then they didn't say 

1608
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:59,040
nothing and it was a lot of repeating 
narratives.

1609
01:11:59,060 --> 01:11:59,430
Oh yeah.

1610
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,310
Every time the show,
the new show I'm gonna do.

1611
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,520
I'm buying one of those little tape 
recorders and I'm putting them on these 

1612
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,631
six fucking morons every day.
Then at night I'm going to do a show 

1613
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:13,911
about what they discussed because this 
is 60 percent of America with these 

1614
01:12:13,911 --> 01:12:14,880
fucking people talking about this is the
idiots.

1615
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:20,420
The shit that comes out of that mouth is
amazing and you sit there and go,

1616
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,790
no one to fucking isis wants to shoot 
us.

1617
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:28,791
Listen to these fucking dummies.
Listen to what's coming out of their 

1618
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:28,791
mouth.
Women's rights.

1619
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,420
That's what the total amount that the.
Well,

1620
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:35,870
what was their argument?
They were saying that the guy that 

1621
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:38,970
argument is everybody trying to be 
smarter than everybody.

1622
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,890
It's just six people trying out with 
each other.

1623
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:44,160
It's like when you go to those dinner 
parties you talk about,

1624
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:47,400
and by the time they served the salad,
you want to put a gun in your fucking.

1625
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,400
Why am I even fucking here with these 
people?

1626
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:52,830
I could have stopped at Burger King,
had a better fucking time.

1627
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:58,430
That's why I don't go to those dinner 
parties because it's eight people to 

1628
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:58,700
once politics comes up.
You loosely,

1629
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:01,440
Joe Rogan.
I don't want to hear about it no more.

1630
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,440
You lose me.
You lose me.

1631
01:13:04,441 --> 01:13:06,630
These new political people talking 
nonsense,

1632
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,460
you lose me.
Move forward.

1633
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:11,580
Either impeach him,
get a new one or shut the fuck up.

1634
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,070
I can't even put the news on it anymore,
but it's definitely 20 minutes on.

1635
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,190
He didn't send the check.
He called her.

1636
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:21,120
What the fuck man.
Just tell who gives a fuck.

1637
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:23,730
Who gives a fuck?
There's got to be something more.

1638
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,190
There's got to be a seal stuck on a 
beach somewhere.

1639
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:31,220
This fucking country.
Something more important than this shit 

1640
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,300
every fucking day.
So the politics is over my world.

1641
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,250
Religion,
you know,

1642
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:40,340
I don't want to.
You're not supposed to talk about 

1643
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:40,340
politics or religion that those fucking 
things,

1644
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:44,660
but this new breed of gentile,
they just talk for the sense of talking 

1645
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:50,390
to see who's the smartest person in the 
room and at the end of the day they're 

1646
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:51,180
all a bunch of dumb fucks.
Anyway.

1647
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,860
It was definitely a lot of people 
talking and just impress other people.

1648
01:13:55,861 --> 01:13:56,520
Yeah,
that's it.

1649
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:01,820
And there's a lot of people saying a 
bunch of things that they've read on 

1650
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:04,611
blogs or read on websites.
Everybody wants to have an intelligent 

1651
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:09,510
conversation and everybody would he get 
the fuck outta here.

1652
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,350
Get the fuck Outta here,
man.

1653
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:11,980
Leave me the fuck

1654
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,630
alone.
Two thousand seven.

1655
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:18,640
Would you rather them talk about 
something that makes sense?

1656
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:24,340
Something simple that you're not trying 
to impress me.

1657
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:26,420
Talk to me about your kids,
what you want.

1658
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,040
There's a lot more than Hollywood 
because people are trying.

1659
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:35,190
I think one of the things about 
Hollywood is that people are always 

1660
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,330
trying out for auditions.
They're always going in on auditions and

1661
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:39,700
they're always.
They always have to be picked and chosen

1662
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:44,910
and they're always trying to position 
themselves like someone that you would 

1663
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:47,950
want to hire.
And so they manufacture these,

1664
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,590
these attitudes based on what they 
think.

1665
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,900
They lick their finger,
they hold it up,

1666
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:55,570
they find out which way the wind's 
blowing and that's the way they go.

1667
01:14:55,810 --> 01:15:00,810
And they start to sort of construct 
their personality based on what they 

1668
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:03,400
think.
All the casting agents,

1669
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:05,590
all of them,
100 percent of them are liberal.

1670
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,450
They're all liberal,
everyone's liberal,

1671
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:12,630
everyone across the board is a democrat 
or of the radical ones are Bernie 

1672
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:16,810
Sanders supporters and everyone has very
clear left wing views,

1673
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,500
whether you like it or not,
not not,

1674
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:23,550
not a judgment on it,
but these people that go in for 

1675
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:27,361
auditions and actors,
which is most of what you're running 

1676
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:29,911
into either actors or screenwriters or 
someone who's trying to do something in 

1677
01:15:29,911 --> 01:15:33,871
Hollywood.
They all want people to know that 

1678
01:15:33,871 --> 01:15:37,861
they're on the right team and they all 
want to say all the things that they 

1679
01:15:37,861 --> 01:15:42,391
think need to be said.
Where you solve a lot of the hypocrites 

1680
01:15:42,391 --> 01:15:43,720
who was in the first few days of this 
Harvey Weinstein,

1681
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,720
please.
Yeah,

1682
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,870
and you know what men at the end of the 
week,

1683
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:54,871
they're all fucked him.
Discuss those because they all fucking 

1684
01:15:54,871 --> 01:15:54,871
knew about it.
Oh,

1685
01:15:54,871 --> 01:15:59,210
they all knew.
They all knew about it for years and 

1686
01:15:59,210 --> 01:15:59,210
none of the old one that raised their 
fucking been been.

1687
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:01,090
What Bro?
With hobbes was given them movies.

1688
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,640
Nobody was complaining.
Yeah.

1689
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:03,970
Well,
I've.

1690
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:06,640
I've heard no complaining,
no complaining from a girl.

1691
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,490
She was saying that a Harvey Weinstein 
gave them all careers.

1692
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:10,240
I was like,
wow,

1693
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:11,920
that's a crazy,
crazy argument.

1694
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:16,950
The one or two of the chicks thanked him
in the ass because now you're going to 

1695
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:17,050
acute.
Listen to leave me the fuck alone.

1696
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:22,290
The ones that really need the smack of 
the mouth of the guys that came up and 

1697
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:22,860
said,
I got molested one side.

1698
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:27,730
My Gut touched on the party one time.
We live for that shit.

1699
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:30,930
We live for somebody to touch a fucking 
Dick.

1700
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,230
You know what I'm saying?
We're not going to go to therapy.

1701
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,440
We don't say nothing.
Somebody grabs you dick.

1702
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:38,340
He just fucking gay guy.
Whatever.

1703
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:39,930
Everybody needs a break from time to 
time.

1704
01:16:39,931 --> 01:16:40,450
You know what I'm saying?

1705
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,330
You never met a gay Guy Sucking Dick.
What?

1706
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,920
I know it's a party.
You know what I'm saying?

1707
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:46,210
I don't know.
I don't know,

1708
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:49,270
but I had a friend one time that he led.
Anybody suck his dick.

1709
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,560
Anybody,
anybody,

1710
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:52,540
anybody who wants to suck his dick did 
as yum.

1711
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,020
Yum.
Stick.

1712
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:58,050
Really.
The one thing he was telling me about 

1713
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:58,050
fucking getting his dick sucked by a gay
guy with ice cubes in his mouth.

1714
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:00,280
I nearly fucking died.
It just let the guy do it.

1715
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,240
He goes,
fuck.

1716
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,480
What was the conversation?
He was telling me how his mouth was cold

1717
01:17:04,481 --> 01:17:06,370
and all this shit and that was fucking 
dying.

1718
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,510
I couldn't believe it at the guy while 
he's sucking dick or I didn't listen.

1719
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,350
I don't want to know about that.
You would want to know,

1720
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:17,530
but you wanted to know about the guy.
Get his dick sucked by a dude with ice 

1721
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:17,530
cubes in his mouth.

1722
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:17,530
I mean,
why not?

1723
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:18,800
What he told me is watching it.
First of all,

1724
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,180
when he told me this story,
I was young.

1725
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,200
I had never heard that story before.
I was like,

1726
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:22,880
18.
He goes,

1727
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:25,850
I love the fucking guy.
Suck my throat one time,

1728
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,880
but if it was so good,
why don't I keep going know it's tough 

1729
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,551
to find somebody who will suck your Dick
with ice cubes in the muffin unless you 

1730
01:17:33,551 --> 01:17:33,650
give them the small 50.
I think once you put it out there,

1731
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:36,080
you put that flag up.
People come.

1732
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:41,320
That was the funniest thing with that 
crazy bitch from superman because she 

1733
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,340
popped up like eight days later.
However he took his dick out.

1734
01:17:43,341 --> 01:17:44,350
One time.
I tell him,

1735
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:47,270
put that back in your pants and crazy 
chick from superman,

1736
01:17:47,271 --> 01:17:48,260
which was.
What's that check?

1737
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:49,830
That's crazy.
Oh,

1738
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:51,800
the one that was hiding in the bushes 
when they found her,

1739
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:53,000
she had no teeth at one.

1740
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,140
What the Hell is her name?
What's her name?

1741
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,670
Superman.
Christopher Reeve,

1742
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,170
right?
No,

1743
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,090
the other one wasn't superman.
Christopher.

1744
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,270
A.
The earliest superman,

1745
01:17:59,480 --> 01:17:59,920
right?
Yeah.

1746
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:04,310
Was the one with Dean Cain who was the 
Dean Cain who was the biggest killer.

1747
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,270
Margot kidder is crazy,
right?

1748
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,480
Yeah.
So this was the other one that you're 

1749
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,281
talking about.
The one who was in superman with Dean 

1750
01:18:15,281 --> 01:18:15,281
Cain.
The TV show.

1751
01:18:15,281 --> 01:18:16,900
Was it really pretty girls name?
Teri hatcher.

1752
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,910
Terry had her name.
She got to talk into the mic,

1753
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:23,510
but she was on a TV show.
She was in desperate housewives to.

1754
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:24,530
Right?
Yeah.

1755
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,270
No,
it wasn't her.

1756
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:31,620
I had an ex girlfriend might get so mad 
when I was talking about how pretty she 

1757
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,710
was missing superman.
Actress found frightened into bushes.

1758
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:35,390
Yeah.
That was in [inaudible] 96.

1759
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:36,890
Margot kidder.
Yeah.

1760
01:18:36,891 --> 01:18:41,891
She went crazy.
Forty seven year old Canadian born 

1761
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:41,891
actress.
Best known.

1762
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:41,891
You know what?

1763
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:46,060
That's the thing.
Once you hit like late forties and 

1764
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,791
you're one of those actresses and they 
stopped calling and your already crazy 

1765
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:52,060
and the pressure builds up.
She'd cut off her own hair with a razor 

1766
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:52,060
blade and attempt to alter her 
appearance.

1767
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,200
A Glendale Police Sargent Rick Young 
said,

1768
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:01,630
oh boy.
She was taken to Olive View Medical 

1769
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:02,960
Center for a 72 hours.
Psychiatric evaluation,

1770
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:08,190
taking a spared 71 hours and 50 minutes 
by just bringing her to me the way.

1771
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:13,160
Yeah,
that bitch is crazy.

1772
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,420
What happened here the other day with 
Corey Feldman though?

1773
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,400
I don't know.
He apparently had arrest.

1774
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,330
Oh,
that thing.

1775
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:20,990
Yeah.
I just,

1776
01:19:20,991 --> 01:19:24,050
I made a joke and people get mad.
Then they got mad,

1777
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:26,210
but it wasn't them getting mad as me 
getting mad at myself.

1778
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,680
What was the Joe?
Uh,

1779
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:32,710
he was wearing a really small jacket 
while he's doing this performance at 

1780
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:36,731
like a minor league baseball game,
and he was doing like this Michael 

1781
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,900
Jackson thing and the jacket was so 
small.

1782
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,900
I go,
is that a jacket he was wearing when he 

1783
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:43,900
was getting diddled when he was a little
kid?

1784
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,900
And I was like,
why did I joke around that?

1785
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:48,050
It was just trying to make greg laughed.
I said something that I was.

1786
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:50,870
And then afterwards when I saw it,
especially out of context,

1787
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:54,590
I was very disappointed in myself.
He wants 10 million exposed.

1788
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,140
He saw that he's out of his mind,
I think.

1789
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:59,120
Um,
I don't think he,

1790
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:04,150
first of all,
he never said that Michael Jackson did 

1791
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:04,150
anything to him.
He was,

1792
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:07,360
he said Michael Jackson didn't.
But he said that there's a lot of 

1793
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:07,650
pedophilia in Hollywood.
He wants to make some sort of a movie on

1794
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:07,740
it,

1795
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:11,220
which I'm sure there's a lot of 
pedophilia in Hollywood,

1796
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,980
but like this idea that people are 
trying to kill him.

1797
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:16,410
You were saying people trying to run 
them over and someone.

1798
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:21,500
Isn't that what we're saying?
I watched the video for the hearts and 

1799
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:21,890
seconds.
I felt bad for my kids.

1800
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,450
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead.

1801
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:27,480
Yet he tried to hit him.
That's not real.

1802
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,910
See,
this is like weird paranoid as shit.

1803
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,160
Let me tell you something.
If they want to kill you,

1804
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,210
you're dead and it's not going to be 
trucks trying to run you over.

1805
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:41,211
It's going to be a guy out of nowhere,
shoots you in the head and gets in his 

1806
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,770
car and no one's going to know who he is
and no one's going to catch them because

1807
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:47,060
they're going to hire a professional.
Like this idea that someone's gonna like

1808
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:50,460
miss him with a car and then they're 
chasing them or running them down.

1809
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,010
I find that very hard.
I mean it's possible,

1810
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,610
but I find it very hard to believe.
I always think that like if someone is a

1811
01:20:56,611 --> 01:20:57,780
very powerful man,
like,

1812
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:01,230
like I don't know if the Clintons ever 
whacked anybody,

1813
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,720
but if they did,
they whack those fucking people.

1814
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,670
Like that one guy.
That was the big,

1815
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:10,170
the big conspiracy theory about the guy 
who released all this stuff.

1816
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:12,840
To wiki leaks of the DNC guy,
seth rich.

1817
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,210
Yeah.
They killed that motherfucker.

1818
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,360
Whoever did it,
whether he was killed because some 

1819
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,821
random person decided to shoot him in 
the back in the middle of the night and 

1820
01:21:22,821 --> 01:21:24,030
not steal his watch or his phone or his 
wallet,

1821
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:28,680
whether it's that or whether it's what 
Julian assange's from Wiki leaks said is

1822
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:33,681
that there's consequences to leaking 
information to wikileaks because that's 

1823
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:33,681
what they were saying and people were 
saying,

1824
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:38,361
look,
this is another one of the Clinton body 

1825
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:39,951
count people and then this giant 
conspiracy theories about how many 

1826
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:39,951
people the Clinton's have had killed.

1827
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:42,660
I don't know if that's true or not.
I have zero information,

1828
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,720
but I do know when people want you dead,
you're dead.

1829
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:50,750
You're dead.
When they're real people like that that 

1830
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:53,601
are real killers and evil fucks.
There's a lot of people that have been 

1831
01:21:53,601 --> 01:21:55,080
killed like Putin.
If Putin wants you dead,

1832
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:59,370
you get shot on TV in front of everybody
and nothing happens.

1833
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,620
No one goes to jail.
No one gets caught.

1834
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:06,650
You're just dead.
That's the type of people we're talking 

1835
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:06,650
about.
So this,

1836
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:10,890
you know,
just have a hard time believing that 

1837
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:14,661
like someone's getting like barely 
missed by a car that's like some movie 

1838
01:22:14,661 --> 01:22:17,961
shit,
like they were coming after me but I 

1839
01:22:17,961 --> 01:22:20,170
lived in the bushes at the last minute 
and now I'm hiding in a motel somewhere 

1840
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:20,410
and I can't tell you where.
But if you give me $10,000,000,

1841
01:22:20,411 --> 01:22:21,090
I want to make a movie.

1842
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,790
I feel bad for corey from when you see 
that,

1843
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:27,180
when you see that performance.
But he's a nice kid and stuff.

1844
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,670
You could see holly was just made a 
mockery.

1845
01:22:29,671 --> 01:22:32,900
Like they just beat him up though.
Well he grew up on TV and the media,

1846
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,370
they'd beat them up.
Roll up in the movies.

1847
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:35,950
You,
you,

1848
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:41,350
you don't have a childhood.
Who the fuck do you know who at named 

1849
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:43,470
one that made it through that meat 
grinder of growing up famous.

1850
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:48,390
That's not completely fucking crazy.
Name one name one.

1851
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,870
Miley Cyrus might've got out of it 
better than any of them.

1852
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,880
She's like her new album's really good.
Great Bro.

1853
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,110
Don't use those ones that she's up on 
the hill and kind of see what the little

1854
01:23:01,111 --> 01:23:03,150
band and this thing of that side of the 
mountains.

1855
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,680
Every cover of Jolene,
jolene,

1856
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,190
Jolene,

1857
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,420
that whole thing.
Although she's great.

1858
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:12,470
I've always liked it.
She got a little something that we can 

1859
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,470
tell them.
No,

1860
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,940
we played.
We played some of it before.

1861
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,260
Yeah.
She fucking.

1862
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,510
Once you started talking about no reef 
fucker.

1863
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:20,970
I used to see at the store all the time,
but when her brother at the weed store,

1864
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,410
she was smoking more than anybody.
Now she quit whatever.

1865
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:25,730
20.
Yeah.

1866
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,370
She's 23.
She's talking shit.

1867
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:30,010
She's a kid.
She's fucking got more money than God.

1868
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,920
I want to show.
I would watch the show on the road.

1869
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:34,870
Hannah Montana Hall please.
Your kids like it.

1870
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,550
I loved that fucking show.
I love her and that show.

1871
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:40,010
She's tremendous.
Yeah.

1872
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:40,750
Play some of that.

1873
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:46,310
Give me some of that with our Internet 
really.

1874
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:49,550
Well.
That's good.

1875
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:50,900
It's not like we paid a shitload of 
money.

1876
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:59,860
Have you seen.
Have you seen John Wick two was right?

1877
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:01,630
We just watched that.
Like it's entertainment.

1878
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,460
It's not going to win an academy award 
and loved it,

1879
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:07,520
but if you think about how many hip men 
like that scene in the train station,

1880
01:24:07,521 --> 01:24:12,521
that chick with the violin and also she 
puts the thing away and she takes a 

1881
01:24:12,521 --> 01:24:15,290
silencer out.
Did you see Eagleton that you get 

1882
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:18,500
Machado?
I watched it twice and I haven't seen 

1883
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:18,500
him know.
He gives this bar too.

1884
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,860
He plays a cab driver so they can think 
about this.

1885
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:25,270
The fight he had the garage with the cab
drive is when he was fucking shooting at

1886
01:24:25,271 --> 01:24:29,530
him and all that shit nasty,
fucked mighty mouse is.

1887
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:34,630
Um,
how about Joe wicks on board and that's 

1888
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:36,220
where the shock to the head with a 
bullet to the head,

1889
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,380
his arm bar,
he clamps shit.

1890
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:43,570
He drops back and he goes by,
he lifts your head with his foot dot.

1891
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:47,030
That's the fucking mighty mouse picking 
up the guy.

1892
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:52,060
Fuck Ray Berg.
That fucking arm bar that he does a 

1893
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:52,810
board.
Great Burger.

1894
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,870
You know what I realized in your,
your phone,

1895
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:57,590
your computer is a

1896
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,730
having problems with the Internet.
Mine is not.

1897
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,750
My computer is not have one.
I just switched out routers,

1898
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,040
routers,
it's the,

1899
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,810
it's the Wifi router.
Oh,

1900
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:08,880
you were on.
So that was on Wifi and then you went to

1901
01:25:08,881 --> 01:25:09,840
ether net.
Is that what you do?

1902
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:10,800
Switching back and forth,
but.

1903
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:12,510
Oh,
I see.

1904
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:14,700
So who trains them for reals?
Joe Rogan.

1905
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:18,000
Well he's obviously got a Machado,
a jacket on,

1906
01:25:18,001 --> 01:25:20,520
so it must have been doing some.
But I'll tell you what,

1907
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:24,960
like all the Jujitsu moves and the judo 
was 100 percent legit.

1908
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:30,260
Like there was no like shenanigans,
like you see him throw somebody around 

1909
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,340
and you don't believe it.
Like even his front kick.

1910
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,620
That's a legit front kick.
Look,

1911
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:36,570
he's doing real shit.
You know what else he did?

1912
01:25:36,571 --> 01:25:38,000
That was real.
He did a lot.

1913
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:40,290
Look at,
he's doing all this fucking strength and

1914
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:41,270
conditioning,
footwork,

1915
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,660
moving.
He's doing all these roles.

1916
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:48,140
Another thing that he did that was super
real was he did a lot of tactical 

1917
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:52,221
firearms drills,
like a lot of close range handgun shit.

1918
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:53,790
Whereas,
you know,

1919
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:58,970
shooting at a steel targets that pop up 
and hiding behind things and turning 

1920
01:25:59,401 --> 01:26:01,650
corners and shooting at targets real 
quick,

1921
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,010
like legitimately looks like he

1922
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,800
knows what he's doing.
Okay.

1923
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:09,140
Have you ever had a chat with him?
I've never met him.

1924
01:26:09,141 --> 01:26:11,870
Tremendous.
I bet he eats breakfast.

1925
01:26:11,871 --> 01:26:15,220
Had Dukes,
Hollywood on the way out.

1926
01:26:15,221 --> 01:26:16,200
You just go.
What's up Dawg?

1927
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:17,180
Nigga?
What's happening man?

1928
01:26:17,181 --> 01:26:18,560
Have a great day.
Yeah.

1929
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:23,561
This is the shit that he did.
There's a whole video of him going 

1930
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:23,870
through these tactical courses and 
you're like,

1931
01:26:23,871 --> 01:26:25,160
whoa,
that's legit.

1932
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,540
Like he's.
He's putting in the time.

1933
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:29,660
Matthew three.
Fucking looks great for 53,

1934
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:32,210
53.
That's crazy.

1935
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:34,700
It looks great.
It looks fucking great.

1936
01:26:34,701 --> 01:26:36,290
That's a good Kamora.
Yeah.

1937
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:37,310
See,
like he's rolling.

1938
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:39,290
What is he up?
That's not a black belt,

1939
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:39,800
is he?
No,

1940
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:42,890
he's white belt.
He a white belt with a black stripe.

1941
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,540
They do is.
They have a facility.

1942
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:48,440
You see this facility where they just 
redid this and culver city.

1943
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,790
The Machados do.
That's Hagen.

1944
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,690
The company,
the one eight,

1945
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:54,650
seven,
whatever the name of that company is his

1946
01:26:54,651 --> 01:26:56,450
company production company.

1947
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:59,150
So they have everything that like most 
companies you go to,

1948
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:01,970
they have a couch and screens and shit.
No,

1949
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:07,300
this is what.
I don't think this is the place they 

1950
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,140
have like a real fucking place where 
they do all stars.

1951
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,760
And that was that John over there?
Yeah.

1952
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:11,450
John,
John,

1953
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,620
John,
John,

1954
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,610
John Keegan Johns.
They're all the Machados,

1955
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,160
but all this stuff that he's doing is 
like super legit.

1956
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,620
There's Hagan.
I mean he's,

1957
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,560
he's really.
He really wanted to learn Jujitsu.

1958
01:27:24,561 --> 01:27:29,561
Like he learned a real Jujitsu as 
opposed to just make it up some fake 

1959
01:27:29,561 --> 01:27:33,371
moves and shit though is odd ball with a
bullet at the end is fucking beautiful 

1960
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:35,660
fun movies.
They're fun,

1961
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,840
ridiculous,
sort of cartoonish violent movements.

1962
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:43,710
It's really good times lately.
The hills itself,

1963
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,910
self fucking crazy.
Well who's the girl to that?

1964
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:51,911
Is that sort of androgynous lesbian 
character who's in a lot of stuff?

1965
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,930
Orange is the new black.
Is that who she is?

1966
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:55,760
She's very pretty.
She's got short hair.

1967
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,540
She's the hit woman in the movie.
Oh yeah,

1968
01:27:58,541 --> 01:27:59,810
yeah.
She plays the deaf girl.

1969
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,730
Deaf girl.
Yeah,

1970
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,670
because you play the deaf girl and one 
was the John Wick two.

1971
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:09,230
Now she's the person and she's the 
killer that wanted to kill him.

1972
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,630
The fuck's her name.
Did she kills herself?

1973
01:28:13,631 --> 01:28:16,550
Is that the chick that kills us up now?
She doesn't kill herself.

1974
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:19,940
Her just show me the fucking imd be.
No,

1975
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,640
that's not it.
What's the uh,

1976
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,790
who uh,
who was in the room?

1977
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:25,970
Ruby rose.
That one?

1978
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:27,080
Yeah.
That chick,

1979
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:32,100
you know,
she's real famous lesbian type 

1980
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:32,100
character.

1981
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,030
She plays,
she's a death in the movie.

1982
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:40,480
I don't remember if member she has like 
this and she's telling them that she 

1983
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,090
wanted a nightcap and shit.
She's always,

1984
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:46,870
she speaks sign language in the movie or
why did I,

1985
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:53,050
how did I forget that?
Stopped smoking weed that it was so 

1986
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,290
broad sober.
I'm just watching people get shot.

1987
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,030
I'm not paying attention to the actual 
plot.

1988
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,660
It's just a fun,
stupid moment.

1989
01:29:00,661 --> 01:29:02,040
I love them both.
That's a weird.

1990
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:05,010
I love him.
I like all his fucking movies,

1991
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:07,410
man.
There's just some people that he watched

1992
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,320
movies on need to think.
Yeah,

1993
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:12,750
well he's,
he's got some classics.

1994
01:29:12,751 --> 01:29:14,730
I mean,
think about the John Wick series.

1995
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,610
He's in the Matrix.
I mean,

1996
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:22,611
this dude has been in some fucking 
classics and bill and Ted's excellent 

1997
01:29:22,611 --> 01:29:24,240
adventure.
You go back to that.

1998
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:29,241
I mean,
imagine that that guy started with like 

1999
01:29:29,241 --> 01:29:33,021
a really silly comedy and then went from
that to be a giant action hero and 

2000
01:29:34,381 --> 01:29:37,140
somehow or another still looks good at 
53.

2001
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:43,060
What's that movie he made with the bank 
robbers that they fucking great big 

2002
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,990
points of the movie to movie Patrick 
swayze.

2003
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:48,090
Fucking good movie too.
Yeah.

2004
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:53,180
I want to know what Keanu reeves does to
reduce stress because he looks fucking 

2005
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:53,460
fantastic.
I look at him.

2006
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:55,050
Look,
he's never in trouble.

2007
01:29:55,740 --> 01:30:00,740
You would never hear from him in a bar.
We're drinking or drinking wine while 

2008
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,580
hanging out with no body or abused.
He don't do Dick.

2009
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:06,270
He grows his beard out.
He walks around looking dirty.

2010
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:11,720
When you see them in the daytime and 
it's just a regular guy like what is he 

2011
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,380
doing?
Has He looked so good?

2012
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,930
He's just a regular guy,
but I said no trouble.

2013
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:21,980
I know,
but like I wonder like what he eats 

2014
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:22,440
because someone told me that he actually
smoked cigarettes.

2015
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:27,540
Like that is not like particularly

2016
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:32,510
like disciplined about his health.
That's incredible.

2017
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,120
Ninety four to 2014.
How's that even possible?

2018
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,100
Imagine if you ran into one of his ex 
girlfriends.

2019
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:39,560
He looks exactly the same.
She was like an old hag.

2020
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:40,910
She's like,
what the fuck?

2021
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,950
I mean that's 20 years of difference and
he looks the same.

2022
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:48,770
Well he looks like shit.
And the 2013 no,

2023
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:54,490
2012,
2013 was a rough turn one that fell off 

2024
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,491
the road.
Well that's where they met here and 

2025
01:30:57,491 --> 01:30:58,390
everything changed.
His life fucking changed.

2026
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:03,460
He started the podcast.
He called me up to go down there on 

2027
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:07,031
what?
On some network that should maybe learn 

2028
01:31:07,031 --> 01:31:07,730
English first or no,
it doesn't matter.

2029
01:31:07,731 --> 01:31:10,520
They love him anyway.
They love him smoking cigarettes.

2030
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:13,780
So he does smoke cigarettes.
You see,

2031
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,360
that's even crazier.
Like how is he not old as fuck?

2032
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,110
Like when people smoke cigarettes,
that shit wears you out.

2033
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:22,910
Like the people that I see that smoke 
cigarettes,

2034
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:25,430
they look far older than he is.

2035
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,600
You couldn't.
That mean that people think there's like

2036
01:31:31,601 --> 01:31:33,160
pictures they find where he was like,
oh,

2037
01:31:33,161 --> 01:31:34,920
can I read was from the 1750,
whatever.

2038
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:36,300
Yeah.
People retarded.

2039
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,620
They photoshop the shit out of that 
anyway.

2040
01:31:38,621 --> 01:31:41,320
Right.
So I watched some crazy shit last night.

2041
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:42,490
Joe Rogan.
I didn't feel good.

2042
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:46,540
I couldn't move much.
I lost the remote and I started watching

2043
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:49,690
this thing about the story that really 
fucking tremendous.

2044
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:54,720
The reels,
it's called real a real news or 

2045
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,841
something that's 2:39
on cable and they had this whole thing 

2046
01:31:57,841 --> 01:32:01,870
out about the godfather.
Fucking interesting as Fuck Jack.

2047
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,540
What was interesting about.
What's his name?

2048
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:06,310
They want to do the movie.
The director.

2049
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:09,670
He was a hippie and San Francisco.
I had a studio up there.

2050
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:12,790
What's his name?
Francis Ford Coppola is a Hippie Guinea.

2051
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:16,050
He ain't regular.
He's Hippie long tenured.

2052
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,620
Huh?
He owns a vineyard.

2053
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:23,010
Hippie dude had the studio and they 
wanted him to do the godfather and he 

2054
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:23,010
was like,
ah.

2055
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:26,110
But he had an assistant called.
What's his sister's name?

2056
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:30,160
A George Lucas was a young assistant,
really?

2057
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,320
That was his young assistant at the 
time.

2058
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:35,860
That's crazy that he talked him into it 
because he goes at the building they had

2059
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,170
was running out of money.
They had no money to pay the rent.

2060
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:40,210
Wow.
We're going to run out of the rent,

2061
01:32:40,211 --> 01:32:42,490
so he talked them into doing it because 
he had to pay the rent.

2062
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:48,010
Look at that.
George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola 

2063
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:48,260
with r two D two.
That's incredible.

2064
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,800
Kids like 24 years old.
Young kids,

2065
01:32:50,801 --> 01:32:52,140
Bro.
Y'All kids.

2066
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:58,200
I'll tell you what was a good move that 
a lot of people were critical of when 

2067
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,951
they sold star wars to Disney because 
Disney is taking that shit and run with 

2068
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:03,580
it.
They run with it.

2069
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:06,220
I mean they're making so many more star 
wars movies.

2070
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:07,420
They're good fucking movies.

2071
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:12,420
They're fun.
They're doing star wars world at 

2072
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:12,420
Disneyland,
which looks insane.

2073
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,900
They released a preview video of it the 
other day.

2074
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,840
Have you taken your girl to a Disneyland
yet?

2075
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,370
No,
she hasn't asked.

2076
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:22,240
You just said,
I'll just wait.

2077
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,440
I'm done.
She hasn't.

2078
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:26,290
She asked about a month ago.
Tell me when you want to go and we'll go

2079
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:26,860
together.
Okay.

2080
01:33:26,861 --> 01:33:27,530
Yeah.
She.

2081
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,530
She asked about a month ago.
We go together.

2082
01:33:29,531 --> 01:33:31,420
It's just stopped getting sick,
bro.

2083
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:32,980
Oh really?
Just got over it.

2084
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:38,270
Yeah,
that's why I'm not doing new year's 

2085
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:40,320
week.
You know that shit because we'll go a 

2086
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:40,320
little.
Wait.

2087
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:40,600
Does she look out the window?
How is she not get car sick?

2088
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,800
Keeps her from getting.
We leave early and I don't feed her.

2089
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,840
We take her out of the house.
Fucking soldier style.

2090
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,440
Oh,
that's good.

2091
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:52,470
And we only go one hour,
so that's why we went to Huntington 

2092
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,470
beach.

2093
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:55,290
We go to Santa Barbara,
so that's what I'm gonna do on those 

2094
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:55,290
little holidays now.
That's good.

2095
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:59,910
Just getting the fuck out of here.
I'm sick and tired of sitting here for 

2096
01:33:59,910 --> 01:33:59,910
Thanksgiving.
Yeah,

2097
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:02,000
take it down and they have eaten beets.
I get the Nice hotel for kids.

2098
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:03,610
Drop them off at eight.
They serve.

2099
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:09,030
You could have the walk to the fucking 
beach for them to have to walk on the 

2100
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:12,940
street and then I'll go up to month to 
see though what I'm familiar.

2101
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,360
I love it up there.
Yeah,

2102
01:34:14,361 --> 01:34:15,030
yeah,
that's it,

2103
01:34:15,031 --> 01:34:20,031
bro.
Go but come back from Portland that 

2104
01:34:20,031 --> 01:34:20,031
Friday.
I come back that Thursday.

2105
01:34:20,031 --> 01:34:21,730
That Friday I'm doing two shows after 
Christmas.

2106
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:25,270
Get back and I'm taking them up the 
month to see though to the second.

2107
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,370
There's nothing to do down here.
Not The dope.

2108
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:32,670
The dope.
Have you thought about moving out of 

2109
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:33,710
here?
Just waiting.

2110
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:37,160
Just waiting for one for another year.
Another year.

2111
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,970
Were you thinking of going?
I don't know.

2112
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:43,300
It's Colorado or Lexington?
Kentucky,

2113
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:45,620
Huh?
Yeah.

2114
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:51,490
There's a lot of people here.
Joey Diaz seems like it's getting worse 

2115
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:55,121
to do.
The thing that freaks me out is the 

2116
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:57,050
eminent doom that one day for sure the 
earth's going to move.

2117
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,290
The fucking water pipes are going to 
break.

2118
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:05,370
Fire's gonna break out.
It's for sure we're going to have a 

2119
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:08,171
disaster and when we have a disaster,
then we're going to realize the real 

2120
01:35:08,171 --> 01:35:09,770
consequences of jamming 20 million 
people into a small area.

2121
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:15,590
That bothers me with all of this was 
going on this summer as the two or three

2122
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:18,620
weeks you'd watch the news.
When you think of that like we got to be

2123
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:23,630
next.
We're sitting here in a cozy fucking 

2124
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,391
warm living room with watching Florida 
underwater Texas on the water.

2125
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:28,130
You know what?
What's going to come to us?

2126
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:29,810
Well,
the fires in northern California,

2127
01:35:29,811 --> 01:35:32,060
we're fucking insane.
Hardly anybody talked about him.

2128
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,400
It's not a ton of people living up 
there,

2129
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:39,401
so people did.
It didn't get the amount of press that 

2130
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:39,530
it deserved because there was so much 
going on in Texas,

2131
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:43,130
so much going on in Florida.
So much going on in Puerto Rico,

2132
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:46,910
but the fucking fires in northern 
California were insane and they couldn't

2133
01:35:46,911 --> 01:35:49,670
do anything about them.
They didn't have fire hydrants and a lot

2134
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:54,671
of these places,
they didn't have access to water and 

2135
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:55,760
they were just burning through towns.
I think they said hundreds of people are

2136
01:35:55,761 --> 01:36:00,761
missing and thousands of buildings were 
burned to the ground and it barely made 

2137
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:05,591
the news.
Fucking Puerto Rico is still with 

2138
01:36:05,591 --> 01:36:05,591
without.
Oh yeah,

2139
01:36:05,591 --> 01:36:05,900
they're fucked.
They're fucked.

2140
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:07,830
And they're not getting any funding and 
you know,

2141
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,580
how come they don't get the funding?
They've got some.

2142
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,140
I mean it's not that they're not getting
funny,

2143
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:14,000
but then they're not getting enough to 
rebuild.

2144
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:19,150
To do what they need to do to get their 
infrastructure back on the stand about 

2145
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:22,331
Puerto Rico is that you have someone and
be a host on one and two that what 

2146
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:28,001
surrounds these cities is what you see 
on tv is he's fucking village.

2147
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:34,020
You know?
Did you read the New York Times article 

2148
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:34,020
about Cuba?
Know about the hurricane,

2149
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,550
how good they are with hurricanes?
No.

2150
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:40,110
You gotta read that article.
Were practicing this shit since 1950.

2151
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:41,210
Well they have to.
They're a fucking.

2152
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,070
When I called my sister,
my sister was like,

2153
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:45,190
it was pretty nice.
We got killed.

2154
01:36:45,191 --> 01:36:48,590
He got killed in combat way when my 
dad's from the got fucking killed.

2155
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:51,290
That's still in the water,
but they don't fuck around.

2156
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,820
They have this complete.
If you could look it up,

2157
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:58,840
a New York Times article,
it was fucking huge about how they have 

2158
01:36:58,840 --> 01:36:58,840
the hurricane.

2159
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,320
How did they handle it?
Community.

2160
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:02,860
They have a.
They fucking the.

2161
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:04,610
What's that?
When they pull you out,

2162
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,960
if I can pull you out right away.
I mean they just like you didn't hear 

2163
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:10,370
about Cuba having a prompt.
Now they got killed,

2164
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:15,700
but they are so used to it.
They have such a great system for 

2165
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:16,820
dealing with it.
The only have.

2166
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:19,340
There you go hurricane tips from.
There you go.

2167
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,670
Unbelievable.
How good is that right there.

2168
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:25,730
The water hitting molecule.
Look at that.

2169
01:37:25,731 --> 01:37:29,480
They got a 19 fifties car and the water 
is like fucking 80 feet in the air.

2170
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,950
Smashing waves against the side of the 
building or the side of the road rather.

2171
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:34,800
Cool.
Is that.

2172
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:37,940
That's pretty bad car.
How cool is that?

2173
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,790
They take those cards and they put like 
four cylinder diesels in them too.

2174
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,400
They do all kinds of crazy shit with 
Shannon.

2175
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,380
Did you watch that show when they did 
it?

2176
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:49,770
The 13 episodes of the Cuban cause now,
but I've seen a lot of things on.

2177
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,800
Are they interesting how they fucking 
paint them and all that shit that they 

2178
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,810
get like tar and put the car together.
Pretty interesting shit.

2179
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:01,200
There was a,
a guy who bought an island,

2180
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:03,180
uh,
outside of,

2181
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:04,200
uh,
Cuba.

2182
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:09,650
I forget what island it was,
but it it got hit so bad by the 

2183
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,670
hurricane that it completely wiped off 
everything on the island.

2184
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,500
This guy,
some billionaire character,

2185
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,220
bought the entire island and for the 
first time in over 300 years,

2186
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:22,221
it's unpopulated.
There's literally no one living on this 

2187
01:38:22,221 --> 01:38:22,221
island.
It went from being this green,

2188
01:38:22,221 --> 01:38:26,961
lush Ireland to be in just a big flat 
patch of dirt like flattened.

2189
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:31,840
It just got hit by the full brunt of the
storm right after this dude bought it.

2190
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:37,460
I mean it.
I don't know how much you spent on it 

2191
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:37,460
except Richard Branson's island.
I don't think so.

2192
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:38,700
No,
no.

2193
01:38:38,701 --> 01:38:42,840
I think it was the guy who owns a John 
Paul Mitchell.

2194
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,260
Nectar island completely.
Oh,

2195
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:51,300
nobody noticed using ad blocking.
Sir Richard Branson says nectar island 

2196
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,500
completely and utterly devastated by 
Hurricane Irma.

2197
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:53,940
Irma.
Yeah.

2198
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:56,940
It's A.
I'm sure that island got jack two,

2199
01:38:57,210 --> 01:39:02,210
but there was an island that is 
completely unpopulated for the first 

2200
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:03,450
time in 300 years.
I forget what the island was,

2201
01:39:03,451 --> 01:39:08,451
but these are just going to get worse.
That's the crazy thing about these 

2202
01:39:08,451 --> 01:39:11,340
hurricanes is they're building up steam 
out in the ocean versus in the Gulf,

2203
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:15,270
like usually they would get to the Gulf 
and they would build up because the Gulf

2204
01:39:15,271 --> 01:39:20,271
has warmer water,
but the water and the ocean is getting 

2205
01:39:20,271 --> 01:39:21,690
so warm that the island of Barbuda I 
don't think.

2206
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:22,350
Yeah,
that's it.

2207
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:24,180
I don't think somebody owns that one.
No,

2208
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:25,470
someone just bought it.
Oh really?

2209
01:39:25,471 --> 01:39:26,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

2210
01:39:26,701 --> 01:39:29,250
Some guy just bought the island of 
Barbuda Amish.

2211
01:39:29,251 --> 01:39:31,970
Something to think.
So you be thinking about labor?

2212
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:35,130
Yes.
Now I think about leaving all the time.

2213
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,230
Yeah.
What been discussing?

2214
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:39,960
You open it up when it was getting a 
100,

2215
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:42,720
nine degrees in fucking October.
We were like,

2216
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:44,820
what is this going to be like in five 
years?

2217
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:46,950
Like is this keep going to keep getting 
worse?

2218
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:50,730
Like if climate change is real,
it seems to be.

2219
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,010
If we're getting record temperatures 
every year,

2220
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:55,050
which seems to be happening at least 
around here.

2221
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:58,410
You gotta wonder like when that's not 
sustainable anymore.

2222
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,870
When you do you want to live in Phoenix 
in August?

2223
01:40:00,871 --> 01:40:04,440
I don't you know that that Phoenix 
weather we've been there before,

2224
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,870
120 degrees.
That's not,

2225
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:12,510
that's not dealable to me.
You know that Robert Deniro vows to 

2226
01:40:14,971 --> 01:40:17,430
rebuild the island of Barbuda after 
Hurricane Irma strikes.

2227
01:40:17,431 --> 01:40:20,430
Why is it filled with black checks now?
He owns a year before.

2228
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:24,890
I guess he bought a resort there.
Jamie's taking it all.

2229
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:25,710
Literally.
No,

2230
01:40:25,711 --> 01:40:25,980
no,
no,

2231
01:40:25,981 --> 01:40:28,320
that's fine.
Oh my God.

2232
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,180
Give a c.
When they did the,

2233
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:32,160
the,
the fucking benefit for him.

2234
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:35,040
They did the tribute to Robert Deniro.
No,

2235
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:40,170
I'm beyond.
Say got it there with a fucking 

2236
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:40,170
miniskirt and stole dancing.
Poor Robert Deniro.

2237
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:41,970
He go crazy.
Oh my God.

2238
01:40:41,971 --> 01:40:45,970
You could see them just melting,
like looking at dogs.

2239
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,870
He loves.
He loves the sisters.

2240
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,880
He does.
Can't be mad at him for that.

2241
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:56,030
It's kind of interesting.
Is there another guy that's known for 

2242
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:56,860
love and black chicks as much as deniro 
is?

2243
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,610
No,
no,

2244
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:05,780
no.
He's like known for it where you crack 

2245
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:05,780
jokes about it and everybody knows the 
joke,

2246
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:06,920
right?
Like it's known for,

2247
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:09,950
but nobody really says no.
It's deniro give them same.

2248
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:11,810
Well,
I mean it's not,

2249
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:16,700
that's just flavor,
but it's an obvious flavor.

2250
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:17,930
It's like,
I mean,

2251
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:23,200
I can't even think of a single celebrity
that's like known for having a 

2252
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,050
predilection for Asian chicks.
Name one.

2253
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:31,140
Okay.
Name another celebrity that's got a 

2254
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:31,140
thing for,
uh,

2255
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,920
for black checks.
Deniro.

2256
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:38,160
It's Zinnia Arrows.
Did running snipes has got to think for 

2257
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:38,160
Asian chicks.

2258
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,720
Vinnie,
thank.

2259
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:42,100
Maybe.
Maybe,

2260
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,600
maybe he's married to one or something.
Something,

2261
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,260
something.
Yeah,

2262
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:46,570
but not enough where like you could tell
a joke about it,

2263
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:49,180
like Deniro was one of those guys were 
like,

2264
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,020
a piece of information has to be so far 
distributed,

2265
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:58,021
so widely distributed that you can crack
jokes about it and everybody knows what 

2266
01:41:58,021 --> 01:42:00,040
you're talking about.
Like that's like the Dinero thing.

2267
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:02,590
It's gotten to the point where anybody 
could crack a joke about it.

2268
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:07,000
Did you prefer any particular woman type
Dayton?

2269
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:08,770
No.
White chicks?

2270
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:09,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

2271
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,680
I love white chicks.
Terry white chicks.

2272
01:42:11,681 --> 01:42:12,640
Love them,

2273
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:13,480
love them,

2274
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:15,130
love them.
Chinese.

2275
01:42:15,131 --> 01:42:16,990
I like dirty white chicks.
Yeah,

2276
01:42:16,991 --> 01:42:18,460
I love 5:30.
I don't know,

2277
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:21,040
just something as a kid.
I liked the Irish checks.

2278
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:26,041
I grew up in a place where I was 
surrounded with Shakespearian freckles 

2279
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:27,580
and red hair and sweaty tits.

2280
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,450
I love all that shit.
You know,

2281
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:34,640
I don't like dirty feet,
but I like when white chicken feet.

2282
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:36,130
I like blank checks,
you know,

2283
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:39,820
they say when you're a kid,
like the things you are surrounded by,

2284
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:44,830
the things that like you first come in 
contact with when you become sexually 

2285
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:48,031
active at that,
that sort of like some cemented in your 

2286
01:42:48,031 --> 01:42:50,851
brain and a lot of people,
but I don't all those marines and all 

2287
01:42:50,851 --> 01:42:50,851
those.
Gina's.

2288
01:42:50,851 --> 01:42:54,451
I can't deal with facebook ads is they 
get gene is.

2289
01:42:55,571 --> 01:42:57,040
Yeah.
They want to fight and shit.

2290
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:02,070
They scream at you and throw shit.
That was something about that that I 

2291
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:03,490
liked them.
They were hotter than fuck.

2292
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:05,020
I love Italian woman,
you know,

2293
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:09,040
but I really like white chicks.
Irish chicks is my shit.

2294
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:14,260
I love him.
I fucking love to.

2295
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:19,290
Just like I have a friend that's Jewish 
and that's all he dates his black 

2296
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:20,650
checks.
You don't really have from the Sopranos.

2297
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,000
Yes.
What was the old man?

2298
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:28,420
He goes,
I don't know if you look a little Pale 

2299
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:28,420
for my taste.
It's just some people.

2300
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:29,200
I have a buddy,
same thing,

2301
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:30,160
Jewish guy.
Love,

2302
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:30,930
love,

2303
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,420
That's all marriages second black chick.
Yeah.

2304
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:34,930
Oh,
that's right.

2305
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,570
That's right.
Yeah.

2306
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:38,060
Yeah.
You know that guy that's a.

2307
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,480
and it's funny because you think,
uh,

2308
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:43,510
like a black arrow.
He's an older guy,

2309
01:43:43,511 --> 01:43:44,560
you know,
he was around.

2310
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:47,230
I could just imagine the first time they
ever went home,

2311
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,720
brought a black chick home.
This does like,

2312
01:43:49,721 --> 01:43:51,100
what the fuck is going on there?
Know?

2313
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:56,260
Well maybe not as dad,
but how about all those fucking people 

2314
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,361
that loved when those movies,
all those [inaudible] now probably 

2315
01:43:58,361 --> 01:44:01,870
racist and then love them and all these 
expected him to be with some fucking 

2316
01:44:01,971 --> 01:44:05,840
mafia looking lady and he shows up with 
some super soul sister.

2317
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:10,930
Well,
that's why I fucking bronx tale was so 

2318
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:13,001
good.
He really put that part of his life and 

2319
01:44:13,001 --> 01:44:13,320
they're like that part with the black 
chick.

2320
01:44:13,321 --> 01:44:14,720
You know,
that kid that went to jail.

2321
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,730
That's what bronx tale was about.
Really?

2322
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:18,230
It was a body.
Remember that movie?

2323
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:23,320
Yeah,
it was about a bronx tale is a good 

2324
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,370
fucking movie and then we just,
I hated the movie theater when I went to

2325
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:26,330
see it.
I didn't like it.

2326
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:27,470
I,
it wasn't for me,

2327
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:30,560
but that was on a couple of weeks ago.
That same with the bikers.

2328
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:33,740
That's a great fucking scene and that's 
a true story.

2329
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:37,400
That's a true fucking store.
This old school,

2330
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,720
Sammy the bull story,
but your bike is willing to his bar,

2331
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:43,310
Sam,
he came back and told them to be cool.

2332
01:44:43,311 --> 01:44:46,040
No clock the door and said no,
you can't leave.

2333
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:47,570
And they just beat you.

2334
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:50,180
Ever seen that?
They just beat the fuck out of all those

2335
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:55,181
bikers and they get out of there.
But that movie was about the kid that 

2336
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:57,590
was on the sopranos that ended up going 
to prison for murder.

2337
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,350
Well,
it's just cultural.

2338
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:01,880
Yeah.
Uh,

2339
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:02,490
there's this,
uh,

2340
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:05,470
Larry's with the guy with bad luck.
His name was marsh,

2341
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,670
so they put them in the closet.
They wouldn't even,

2342
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:10,390
I don't want his money touching my 
money,

2343
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,600
so bad luck.
But that whole thing is about him,

2344
01:45:13,601 --> 01:45:14,600
the date and the black.
Jake.

2345
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:20,410
And then they go to the member,
was that that street in the Bronx where 

2346
01:45:20,841 --> 01:45:24,050
I used to get nickel bags,
whatever avenue off that,

2347
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:29,051
all that shit up there so it adds in a 
black neighborhood so he would have to 

2348
01:45:29,051 --> 01:45:33,101
walk home.
And then when on the walk home is for 

2349
01:45:33,101 --> 01:45:36,251
friends,
went into the black neighborhood with 

2350
01:45:36,251 --> 01:45:36,900
the car and they got blown up.
They got to watch this movie again.

2351
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:41,480
It's a good movie man.
That chazz Palminteri guy.

2352
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,580
He did a lot of shit and then he kind of
vanished.

2353
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,740
Like he's still around.
He's doing this shit and Broadway now.

2354
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:51,620
What's he doing?
The Bronx Tale on Broadway.

2355
01:45:51,621 --> 01:45:55,280
He just took it out to say he took it 
out into new musical.

2356
01:45:57,570 --> 01:46:00,050
Get even with the gay community.
Look at their narrow.

2357
01:46:00,051 --> 01:46:05,051
And who's the guy on the left?
That's the gay guy who tell a bronx 

2358
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:07,370
tale.
Yeah.

2359
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:09,290
This is a good movement.
Bizarre,

2360
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:13,940
bizarre.
Remember this guy lived at your boys and

2361
01:46:13,941 --> 01:46:16,460
they used to go home at night and tell 
stories every night.

2362
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:22,120
So those guys are pissed because they 
said supposedly took some of their 

2363
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:22,120
stories.
Frankie Renzulli,

2364
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:27,880
most of his stories from East Boston,
I actually wound up in this movie,

2365
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:29,760
so he did a,
they,

2366
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:32,360
they kinda have residual.
He was the kind of the Sopranos.

2367
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:37,361
Right.
And he realized he's written for a lot 

2368
01:46:37,361 --> 01:46:37,550
of things.
Yeah.

2369
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:41,630
But that world,
that world of guineas and mob movies and

2370
01:46:41,631 --> 01:46:43,010
mob stuff,
it's just like,

2371
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:48,100
it becomes,
it's like an identity and a weird 

2372
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:51,971
business.
It's like an identity that they put 

2373
01:46:51,971 --> 01:46:52,500
this,
you know,

2374
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,740
the connected Italian character 
identity,

2375
01:46:55,950 --> 01:47:00,950
you know,
and like from the soprano's on that 

2376
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:01,110
became a big selling point in Hollywood.

2377
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:04,190
Like it was a niche that people got 
excited about.

2378
01:47:04,191 --> 01:47:06,720
Like the Italian gangster movie became a
big thing.

2379
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:11,721
The Italian gangster films became a big 
thing and so there was like a whole 

2380
01:47:11,721 --> 01:47:13,650
bunch of guys,
like I'm sure you went out for auditions

2381
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,710
and you around those guys that were in 
that loop.

2382
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:20,730
It's a dumb little dumb loop.
It's hilarious.

2383
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:21,910
It really is.
Well,

2384
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:26,920
well they were talking about less but 
like the sopranos killed a Mafia TV 

2385
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:27,330
show.
That's it.

2386
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:31,080
You won't see the movie again for 10 
years because there were so good.

2387
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:32,960
Yeah,
it just covered too many of the bait.

2388
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:37,970
You've never seen it again.
Every once in awhile I got the script 

2389
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:37,970
for a mob where they want you to go 
refill this.

2390
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:42,060
I opened it up and if I see Gino baby or
Tony or Angelo,

2391
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:46,710
I closed a script because you're living 
in a fucking fools paradise.

2392
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:49,230
It's not going to get made,
which is not going to do nothing.

2393
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:54,260
You got to come and that's why they 
haven't been able to figure out the 

2394
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:54,420
posts.
The prattle world.

2395
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:56,130
Right.
It was too much.

2396
01:47:56,131 --> 01:48:00,420
They got into the Columbus.
They even got into Columbus Day.

2397
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:05,660
That's how brilliant a fucking sopranos.
What they did an episode about Columbus 

2398
01:48:06,181 --> 01:48:09,830
Day when they sent people down there and
Nick Depalo played the cop and.

2399
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:11,130
Oh yeah.
Do you remember,

2400
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:14,250
remember that soprano started off as a 
comedy?

2401
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,570
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2402
01:48:15,571 --> 01:48:20,571
Sopranos started off.
The first episode was over the top 

2403
01:48:20,571 --> 01:48:21,120
comedy where,
what's her name?

2404
01:48:21,121 --> 01:48:24,630
Ed Falco was outside with an AK 47 
because her daughter was trying to sneak

2405
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:27,990
out.
I mean she was a cartoon character.

2406
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:29,910
I mean every.
It was ridiculous,

2407
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:34,970
and then slowly but surely it became 
this really intense,

2408
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,950
complicated drama and it wasn't funny at
all.

2409
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,290
Well,
the mother died.

2410
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:42,870
That changed everything.
It was the first show that somebody died

2411
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:46,110
and changed the course of it because it 
would've been completely different.

2412
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:47,910
It would have ended with her being the 
boss.

2413
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,310
Yeah.
It would've been the first time her,

2414
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:54,120
but they went back to this last night 
with the Godfather,

2415
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,360
how they had failed twice to make a mob 
movie.

2416
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:00,720
Kirk Douglas had done a movie in 
[inaudible] 67.

2417
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:02,460
It didn't do well.
So with this,

2418
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:05,460
Mario Puzo was fucking.
The book was tremendous.

2419
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,980
They sent it to.
What's his name?

2420
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:11,520
They did not want Marlon Brando.
Really?

2421
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:12,780
No,
they did not.

2422
01:49:12,781 --> 01:49:16,350
Marlon Brando had been a dud.
He had just done fucking a.

2423
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:19,830
That movie,
that movie where he bought the island.

2424
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:21,600
Oh,
island of Dr Moreau.

2425
01:49:21,670 --> 01:49:22,710
No,
no.

2426
01:49:22,711 --> 01:49:23,820
The one.
The big one.

2427
01:49:23,821 --> 01:49:28,310
When he first bought the island in 70,
68 or so when he bought his own eyes,

2428
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,980
but he shot the movie a bounty with his 
treasure.

2429
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,470
I forget what the name of the movie is.
One Christo.

2430
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:37,200
Somehow they gave a bunch of money and 
go down there and shoot the movie.

2431
01:49:37,201 --> 01:49:38,580
He found love.
One of the natives.

2432
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,670
So he got like the first guy,
hey jamie,

2433
01:49:41,671 --> 01:49:45,230
can we direct the movie?
And he started fucking raining everyday.

2434
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:46,950
So paramount.
One of the,

2435
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,380
I saw the footage,
they saw birds and people running.

2436
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:52,530
They go,
what happened to our moving?

2437
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:57,870
So they kinda like fucking five a brand 
off from directing it mountain.

2438
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:01,600
Beautifully mutiny on the bounty.
So he was done.

2439
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:06,660
He was.
When he came back from the states like 

2440
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:07,690
he was persona non grata.
They didn't want to talk to him no more.

2441
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:11,320
You fucked on money.
You left your wife for this hot chicken?

2442
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,970
An island?
Yeah.

2443
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:12,550
Ooh,
she's hot.

2444
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,450
Yeah.
Once he met her,

2445
01:50:13,451 --> 01:50:15,010
he told his wife to go fuck yourself.

2446
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:18,410
Go fuck themselves.
And he just started hanging out.

2447
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:21,390
It goes full screen with her.
God Damn,

2448
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:24,190
I get it.
Holy Shit.

2449
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,570
That's really jet,
Huh?

2450
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:31,740
Then he bought the fucking true man.
She's fucking hot.

2451
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:36,360
That's some serious polynesian jeans 
right there.

2452
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,370
So when he came back,
they didn't want,

2453
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:43,370
they didn't want Michael either what 
they wanted they wanted,

2454
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:45,040
didn't want out,
but you know what you mean.

2455
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:50,400
For Michael Corleone,
they wanted a Robert Redford.

2456
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:51,940
Well,
what?

2457
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,610
Or uh,
or uh,

2458
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:56,620
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh,

2459
01:50:56,621 --> 01:50:57,940
that's hilarious.
That's who they,

2460
01:50:57,970 --> 01:51:01,140
that's what they wanted for rocky.
That's hilarious.

2461
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:05,590
That's what they want.
That answer at night from 73 to 75.

2462
01:51:05,591 --> 01:51:07,320
We need a black actor.
How about riding on you?

2463
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,690
We have a boxer.
How about Ryan O'neil?

2464
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,320
They love nails.
Look.

2465
01:51:11,321 --> 01:51:14,260
So they were going to put them in rocky.
You don't even hear about him anymore?

2466
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:16,030
Well,
he's playing 2000 fucking years old.

2467
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:21,030
What does this cat has?
Original cast lists people he had 

2468
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:22,120
written down for.
What were the father?

2469
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:25,090
Wow.
Jimmy.

2470
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:27,880
Jimmy.
So who's,

2471
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:29,000
who's,
who wrote this list?

2472
01:51:29,001 --> 01:51:30,840
This is a couple of hopeless.
Wow.

2473
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:35,860
Corleone Marlin Brando underlined.
He wanted.

2474
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:41,400
He wanted the cheeto badly.
He just did that movie about the heroin 

2475
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:42,250
or something.
That's an enough.

2476
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:45,790
And they didn't want him.
The studio didn't want them to know.

2477
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:47,440
The studio didn't want them.
He wanted them,

2478
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:49,390
but the studio didn't want.
Wow,

2479
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:53,320
so fucking John Saxon,
which are the plate Sunday call.

2480
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:58,330
Oh,
that would've been from the enter the 

2481
01:51:58,330 --> 01:51:58,330
Dragon Dragon.
Yeah,

2482
01:51:58,330 --> 01:52:01,720
like I was a good actor,
Robert Duvall for looking at that list.

2483
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:05,140
Wow.
That's amazing.

2484
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:10,590
Yeah.
There's some movies that just even 

2485
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:10,590
today,
if you try to watch them there for now.

2486
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:12,660
Phenomenal.
That's phenomenal.

2487
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:17,690
This one's one of them.
Don't watch the one with the back 

2488
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:17,690
footage though.

2489
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:17,690
Which ones?
That?

2490
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:20,200
The one that HBO released Sunday.
He's a tree.

2491
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:22,660
You could tell her bad James Collins as 
an actor then.

2492
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,940
Oh,
it's brutal.

2493
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:27,930
It's brutal.
Have you seen the eight hour one now?

2494
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,770
Hbo,
where they put them all together.

2495
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:32,800
They put them all together and they put 
all the pieces back in.

2496
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,800
Really?
But you got to have a lot of times.

2497
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,210
Eight hours.
Yeah.

2498
01:52:37,211 --> 01:52:39,130
It's like six hours.
It was a time for that.

2499
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:44,490
You break it up into two hours segments,
but it's pretty interesting and shows 

2500
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:45,920
you what really happened with the father
and him

2501
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,170
like the fall would just torture 
Michael.

2502
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:50,720
How you doing?
How's that little white girlfriend?

2503
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,760
Doing a hysterical,
he was,

2504
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:55,750
there's a scene in the hospital.
He pulls him over and goes,

2505
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:59,300
I was that little white piece of shit,
the Patella,

2506
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,450
and then he like,
how's those metals,

2507
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,390
whether the shooting are you shooting 
strangers and shit,

2508
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:10,870
and then they go into it,
opens up with them at the wedding and 

2509
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:14,201
they go from the wedding to the hospital
to see the guy that originally caused 

2510
01:53:14,201 --> 01:53:17,930
the Eddie and you got to see that same.
The dude is sitting there and I'm a 

2511
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,990
brand or walks in and he's like,
Godfather,

2512
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:24,110
hold my hand.
The reapers gonna come.

2513
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:26,150
But if he sees you,
he'll be scared.

2514
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:31,350
Like that's how fucking much.
They loved the Godfather and then he 

2515
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:31,350
goes,
listen,

2516
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:33,230
I'm here with my four sons.
He ain't going to bother you.

2517
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:39,140
I'm here with your sons.
I'm here with my sons to pay their 

2518
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:39,140
respects to.
He ain't going to bother you.

2519
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:44,060
Shows all that shit.
That guy that blew up his wife in 

2520
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:45,800
Sicily,
it shows him getting him in buffalo now.

2521
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:47,490
Oh really?
The back end?

2522
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:52,540
Yeah.
He owns a pizza parlor and he gets in 

2523
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:52,540
the car and they blow them up.
They show all that shit.

2524
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:53,490
So who cut that stuff out?
The studio,

2525
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:55,880
the studio.
It was too long,

2526
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,440
you know,
don't quote me on that.

2527
01:53:57,441 --> 01:53:58,880
Maybe the studio,
maybe the director,

2528
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:02,570
but James Caan scenes or just not to 
know.

2529
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:05,630
You can see he doesn't,
but Michael was fucking tough.

2530
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:08,210
Michael slots,
all those dudes.

2531
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:12,980
That's when directing was directing.
If you've ever done anything bad in your

2532
01:54:12,981 --> 01:54:14,720
life,
anything bad.

2533
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:17,290
When you do something bad,
you know he is ranked.

2534
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:21,230
Your ears ring or when your adrenaline 
is off the charts.

2535
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:26,830
When you're hiding in a bush and 
somebody is coming towards you and you 

2536
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:28,940
got to hit them with that stick,
you have no idea what happens to you.

2537
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:31,640
You have no idea.
Joe Rogan.

2538
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:34,490
That's why I've always loved the 
Godfather,

2539
01:54:34,491 --> 01:54:37,850
all those types of movies because when 
he comes out of the bathroom,

2540
01:54:37,851 --> 01:54:41,840
you hear the train screeching key,
right?

2541
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:44,070
But that's what you hear when your 
department,

2542
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,940
Bro,
when you already know.

2543
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:49,010
I'm just talking about hitting somebody 
in the head with a stick.

2544
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:54,280
Right?
Nevermind having to come out of a 

2545
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:54,280
restaurant with a gun and shooting two 
people.

2546
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:55,070
I can't imagine where your heart go.
Wait.

2547
01:54:55,071 --> 01:54:58,910
Did you just get up and show people your
heart beats that adrenaline's going?

2548
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:01,700
You fucking.
You don't hear nothing.

2549
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:04,130
Like when I used to rob houses or rob 
drug dealers,

2550
01:55:04,131 --> 01:55:08,560
I can't hear nothing.
You just found is going to bro.

2551
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:11,570
You just go to your heart.
Takes fucking over.

2552
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,000
You know I had this.
I forgot about this.

2553
01:55:14,001 --> 01:55:17,780
I had this when I was 19.
I was an electrician and Aspen,

2554
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,230
there was a dude that used to break my 
balls all the time,

2555
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,690
like say stupid things for me.
He would always go,

2556
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:25,190
there's two things about you I don't 
like.

2557
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:26,810
You're Cuban and you're from the east 
coast.

2558
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:33,040
So I always knew me and this guy,
we're going to have a little fucking 

2559
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:33,040
problem.
I was 19.

2560
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,230
He was a little older than me.
I always knew man,

2561
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:37,280
this motherfucker when I have a problem 
and he'd always say little things to me,

2562
01:55:37,281 --> 01:55:40,640
go get my tools out of the bed.
And I always tell them,

2563
01:55:40,641 --> 01:55:41,690
go get them yourself.
Pitch.

2564
01:55:41,691 --> 01:55:43,950
And I was Kinda scared of that guy,
but I knew me and him,

2565
01:55:43,951 --> 01:55:48,951
we're going to battle one day and one 
day he said something and I told him to 

2566
01:55:48,951 --> 01:55:48,951
go fuck himself.

2567
01:55:48,951 --> 01:55:51,480
And when I came back from lunch,
you put a box cutter to my throat.

2568
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,610
He got me.
As I was coming in,

2569
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:55,860
he threw me against the wall and you had
the box cutter on me.

2570
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:58,980
I was bigger than him physically.
And I knew I could fuck them up.

2571
01:55:58,981 --> 01:56:00,530
I was just scared.
I was a young kid.

2572
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:02,370
I was not in my.
I was living in basalt,

2573
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,920
Colorado,
you know,

2574
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:08,960
I was not on my turf with my friends.
But after he put that knife to my 

2575
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,630
throat,
I'll never forget that.

2576
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:12,420
I fucking like,
when he stepped away,

2577
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:15,960
that thing came into my mind where if 
you pull your gun out,

2578
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:18,820
you was like,
that thing came out that.

2579
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:20,940
And I go,
I'm going to fucking kill this guy.

2580
01:56:21,150 --> 01:56:22,620
I'm going to do something bad for this 
guy.

2581
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:26,610
And I had a guy who used to shoot with 
that taught me how to shoot guns.

2582
01:56:26,611 --> 01:56:31,611
He was a Vietnam vet.
And on the weekends I would give him 

2583
01:56:31,611 --> 01:56:34,671
money.
He teach me how to shoot everything a 

2584
01:56:34,671 --> 01:56:34,671
and fucking ak.
He told he had every weapon.

2585
01:56:34,671 --> 01:56:36,510
He was just a Vietnam vet that lived in 
Aspen.

2586
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:41,780
And I finally figured out why they put 
all those Vietnam vets around Aspen in 

2587
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:43,050
Colorado.
Why Norad?

2588
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:47,250
Norad.
So they can be ready to fucking rock.

2589
01:56:47,251 --> 01:56:49,120
I never thought about that.
You know,

2590
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:51,720
everybody thinks that if we get hit,
we're going to hit California,

2591
01:56:51,770 --> 01:56:56,770
New York,
the most strategic place that would be 

2592
01:56:56,770 --> 01:56:59,090
wouldn't it?
Because they control everything out of 

2593
01:56:59,090 --> 01:57:00,510
Colorado and under that fucking mountain
really lets you read up about it.

2594
01:57:00,511 --> 01:57:02,070
I don't know shit about that.
Yeah.

2595
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:07,071
Like that was years ago.
They always said we will get hit we to 

2596
01:57:07,071 --> 01:57:07,071
hit Colorado.
So what happened with you and the guy in

2597
01:57:07,071 --> 01:57:10,950
the box in the guy in the box cut.
I kept fucking like I was scared of this

2598
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:11,640
guy,
Joe Rogan.

2599
01:57:11,641 --> 01:57:16,641
I was definitely scared of this guy.
But at that time I wanted to kill my 

2600
01:57:16,641 --> 01:57:17,160
stepfather.
So I went to my friend,

2601
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,990
the guy who was teaching me how to shoot
and shit.

2602
01:57:18,991 --> 01:57:20,340
And I told him about what happened.
He goes,

2603
01:57:20,341 --> 01:57:25,341
well,
if you're thinking they're shooting his 

2604
01:57:25,341 --> 01:57:25,341
step,
father,

2605
01:57:25,341 --> 01:57:26,690
why don't you use this guy's practice?
Well,

2606
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:31,730
what's the difference if you're going to
go back to New Jersey and struck your 

2607
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:32,520
stepfather and shoot them,
start with this guy.

2608
01:57:32,690 --> 01:57:34,830
Use them is fucking practice.
You know what I'm saying?

2609
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:37,680
I was a little pushy.
I thought about it,

2610
01:57:37,681 --> 01:57:39,510
but I didn't like that.
The guy pulled a knife to my throat.

2611
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:44,720
I fucking didn't like that.
Joe Rogan at all said I'm going to get 

2612
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:44,720
this guy.

2613
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:47,700
So I was cool to him at work.
I let him go to work.

2614
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:53,090
This went on.
I figured like get them over the 

2615
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:53,090
holidays.
He was a boozer and he went through this

2616
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:56,670
little bar and carbondale all the time 
and I figured my get him down there.

2617
01:57:56,671 --> 01:57:59,610
So I went to Fred,
I go teach me everything I need to do to

2618
01:57:59,611 --> 01:58:00,840
get this guy down.
And he goes,

2619
01:58:00,841 --> 01:58:02,910
we're going to get you in and out of 
there as quick as possible.

2620
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,400
And he's the first guy that ever taught 
me a hanger.

2621
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,640
You whip somebody with a fucking hanger,
it's all low.

2622
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:09,750
You take the hanger,
whip it,

2623
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,020
taped the other side and just come out 
of dark with a hanger.

2624
01:58:13,021 --> 01:58:14,760
They don't see nothing.
All they see is this.

2625
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:18,090
That's all they see.
They don't see a fucking anger.

2626
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:20,830
You know what I'm saying?
I never forget that.

2627
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:23,070
I stopped this guy for like fucking a 
week man.

2628
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,330
And I finally fucking call them job 
early and you know,

2629
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:27,990
I couldn't hear for like two days after 
I hit him with that anger.

2630
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:33,830
So you beat him up with a hanger.
I pick them up with a hanger and a 

2631
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:34,950
fucking sticks pointing,
stick fighting stick.

2632
01:58:34,951 --> 01:58:38,750
You know you have those,
you know like Cali Cali's ticks.

2633
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,440
Yeah.
I took one of those.

2634
01:58:40,441 --> 01:58:45,441
I put it in my jacket and I whipped them
with the hanger first when they got out 

2635
01:58:45,441 --> 01:58:48,391
of his car.
And then when he went down I whipped 

2636
01:58:48,391 --> 01:58:48,550
them in the legs dog.
I pissed my pants.

2637
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:53,850
I had shit in my ass.
Fear is a motherfucker like even when 

2638
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:58,441
you're winning,
fear is a motherfucker and I couldn't 

2639
01:58:58,441 --> 01:58:58,810
hear for two days after what happened to
the dude.

2640
01:58:59,470 --> 01:59:01,860
Never came back to work really.

2641
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:05,680
I went back after the holidays and I was
going to get arrested that day because I

2642
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:07,660
did well.
I had the match with the holes.

2643
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:13,200
I did it perfectly.
I throw all the clothes away down in 

2644
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:13,240
Glenwood Springs.
I got rid of everything.

2645
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:18,810
You don't want me.
I had this teacher that taught me 

2646
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:18,810
everything.
He goes,

2647
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:19,270
if you're going to have blood on your 
clothing,

2648
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:21,580
dns sweat,
get rid of everything.

2649
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:26,610
So I had a bag in the car.
I went down valley and got through my 

2650
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:27,000
clothes as I went down to eat.
Do you ever go up and down?

2651
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:32,010
80 two.
If you go from glenwood springs up to 

2652
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:34,381
Aspen,
that's one of the worst roads in the 

2653
01:59:34,381 --> 01:59:34,381
country.
I just drew my clothes out of there.

2654
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:36,250
If I was 18,
19,

2655
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:40,450
this guy had to be like 31 bro.
I could smell the fucking.

2656
01:59:40,451 --> 01:59:42,120
I was just whipping them at night with 
that.

2657
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:47,200
Then I took the stick out and I hit him 
in the legs a few times and then I close

2658
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:47,680
to him.
I said,

2659
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:52,681
don't tell him,
listen to nobody who I'll fucking come 

2660
01:59:52,681 --> 01:59:54,961
back and beat you again and I,
because I didn't want them to hear my 

2661
01:59:54,961 --> 01:59:56,800
voice.
I went back after the holidays.

2662
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,840
He was,
he never came back to work.

2663
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,900
The guy sent somebody down to the house 
and never came back,

2664
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:05,530
but I was so deaf,
like there's been a couple times that my

2665
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:10,531
hearing has been gone because of 
something bad that I've done in the 

2666
02:00:10,531 --> 02:00:14,341
fucking my heartbeat and the adrenaline 
or you hear is like a fucking be well,

2667
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:21,970
most people are just not used to that 
kind of confrontation,

2668
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:26,080
you know?
Well the average person,

2669
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:28,600
I mean you just couldn't let him get 
away with that.

2670
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:31,350
That little mother Fucker,
you know,

2671
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:32,860
he never saw him again.
After that.

2672
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:34,930
I never saw him again and moved to 
everything.

2673
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:40,140
He moved.
I was shitting pickles for a couple of 

2674
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:41,160
weeks.
Come get me a note.

2675
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:44,390
Was You?
I don't know really.

2676
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:49,780
I don't know.
I gave him like a three month window 

2677
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:51,040
after the knife thing.
I wanted him to say I want him to forget

2678
02:00:51,041 --> 02:00:52,890
about it.
Like I was going to do it the right way.

2679
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,340
That's how you do it.
Right.

2680
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:55,250
You know?

2681
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:57,160
Wow.

2682
02:00:58,290 --> 02:01:02,020
I imagine that was you at 19,
like imagine

2683
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:08,850
like stop.
This was points in your life where you 

2684
02:01:08,850 --> 02:01:08,850
go.
Was that even really me?

2685
02:01:08,850 --> 02:01:11,760
I mean I know it was me because I have 
the memory of it.

2686
02:01:11,761 --> 02:01:14,070
I know it was my physical body back 
then,

2687
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:18,180
but it wasn't really me that was trying 
to write the book.

2688
02:01:18,181 --> 02:01:20,250
I would read like,
well that those chapters,

2689
02:01:21,210 --> 02:01:26,210
I would read it two days later and that 
would have to stop Joe Rogan because it 

2690
02:01:26,210 --> 02:01:28,830
didn't stop.
It didn't stop when I was in high school

2691
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:33,150
or went from Robert Gas station for my 
buddy losing $60,000.

2692
02:01:33,151 --> 02:01:38,151
Now we had to rob somebody to get the 
money that I was on a flight to 

2693
02:01:38,151 --> 02:01:38,151
Sarasota,
Florida.

2694
02:01:38,151 --> 02:01:38,760
The people,
you know,

2695
02:01:38,761 --> 02:01:41,810
when I 18 I robbed a jewelry store and I
had to go away.

2696
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:45,530
I got a call one day and then come back.
The guy got it all taken care of.

2697
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:48,050
The guy got,
they didn't arrest you in 60 days,

2698
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:50,860
so he followed the insurance report.
Now they can arrest you,

2699
02:01:51,570 --> 02:01:54,440
you know,
like I learned about all those things at

2700
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:55,790
a young age.
Like what a scam.

2701
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:00,140
So the guy knew I robbed them and then 
after with a friend of mine told me,

2702
02:02:00,141 --> 02:02:01,280
cause yeah,
I bumped into a guy,

2703
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:02,770
the Christmas party,
he was happier,

2704
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:03,920
robbed them.
He goes,

2705
02:02:03,921 --> 02:02:08,921
he wanted you to rob him.
He just didn't want you to come back 

2706
02:02:08,921 --> 02:02:09,590
because then you get arrested and have 
to pay restitution.

2707
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:11,570
What can I afford?
$5 a week,

2708
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,730
right?
If he cut like seen insurance,

2709
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:16,160
it gets a big lump sum payment.
Plus he could liable what,

2710
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:20,210
what was in there.
So I was doing him a favor.

2711
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:23,210
No Shit.
Fucking crazy.

2712
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:26,060
What you learned and what you learned as
a fucking young.

2713
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:28,070
I was fucked up.

2714
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:31,310
Joe.
Isn't it amazing that you got through it

2715
02:02:31,311 --> 02:02:33,320
all though?
That's the really crazy thing.

2716
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:38,300
You got through it all pretty unscathed.
No physical cost me a couple of years in

2717
02:02:38,301 --> 02:02:39,120
my life.
Of course,

2718
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:44,140
my daughter asked me two years of my 
life that in my early when I got 

2719
02:02:44,151 --> 02:02:46,850
arrested,
I got arrested for the kidnapping.

2720
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:50,360
Then I had the kid and then I had my 
beef with him.

2721
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:56,350
You know,
I had the beef with him when he called 

2722
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:56,350
me a Spec and I smacked him and I had 
two families already.

2723
02:02:56,570 --> 02:03:01,570
They were going to throw me in jail for 
fucking him being the guy that was 

2724
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:01,570
there.
You're John,

2725
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:03,980
my ex wife and when you have two 
felonies,

2726
02:03:03,981 --> 02:03:06,470
one more,
but he couldn't in the city of thank God

2727
02:03:06,471 --> 02:03:10,190
for Boulder Liberals.
Thank God for Boulder and liberals.

2728
02:03:10,191 --> 02:03:15,191
You can't use a racial slur and inside 
the city limits of boulder really 

2729
02:03:15,191 --> 02:03:17,300
because ego because the University of 
Colorado,

2730
02:03:17,301 --> 02:03:21,170
when that chick called Jj Flanagan the 
Nigga and he smacked him and he got away

2731
02:03:21,171 --> 02:03:23,350
with it on Monday at court because she 
caught on.

2732
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:25,280
So the same thing.
W,

2733
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:28,280
what was that store?
Some white chick was drunk coming out of

2734
02:03:28,281 --> 02:03:30,950
a fucking pogo when those 18 and over 
bars,

2735
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:35,590
and she got into an argument with Jj 
Flanagan and he always tells racist.

2736
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,290
Jj Flanagan was a football player at the
time for the University of Colorado.

2737
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:44,740
From that from like 1989 to 93 that a 
lot of problems in Colorado that were 

2738
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:47,480
getting caught criminals,
but what it was,

2739
02:03:47,481 --> 02:03:49,970
it was just three black guys walking 
down,

2740
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:52,250
you know,
fucking Boulder at 11:00

2741
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:53,510
at night,
cops pull over.

2742
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,090
One of them says racism.
They get into a fight.

2743
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:57,770
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

2744
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,500
nobody was angels.
That fucking one linebacker the heck and

2745
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:03,590
Davidson Mcgee.
Somebody called him a yom one time.

2746
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:07,470
He punched him in the face so hard.
He broke the guy's eye socket.

2747
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:11,660
That guy ended up going to the fucking 
New York giants as a linebacker.

2748
02:04:12,710 --> 02:04:16,400
But that's how bad that problem with the
college football players.

2749
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:21,460
It was that bad in boulder at one time.
So when I went to court and the guy 

2750
02:04:21,591 --> 02:04:22,820
goes,
there's no charges here.

2751
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:26,540
Even the cops wouldn't charge me.
They wrote me a summons to go to court,

2752
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:29,630
but they wouldn't charge me for smacking
the fucking dude.

2753
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,300
Then right after that I knew.
You know what,

2754
02:04:32,301 --> 02:04:34,120
man,
if I stay here,

2755
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:36,740
I'm going to go to jail.
That's number one.

2756
02:04:36,741 --> 02:04:38,460
Number two,
I really wanted to do comedy.

2757
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:41,550
I really wanted to give.
Comedy is shot,

2758
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:42,420
you know,
I was like,

2759
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:44,790
I gotta give it a shot here.
How old were you?

2760
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:48,450
Thirty two years old.
I got on stage the first time.

2761
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:51,000
Nineteen 91.
So how long has that?

2762
02:04:51,001 --> 02:04:53,070
Twenty six years,
right?

2763
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:54,900
Yeah,
26 years.

2764
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,170
So the first time I dicked around for 
the first two years,

2765
02:04:58,171 --> 02:04:59,580
but light by 93.

2766
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:03,990
I got really serious about it.
So when I went back to be a dad,

2767
02:05:03,991 --> 02:05:06,300
I was really serious about that.
I had a good job,

2768
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:11,900
but they kept fucking with me.
But that one day when he called me a 

2769
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:11,900
spic and I smacked him,
that changed everything.

2770
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,830
I was like,
that's never going to be the same.

2771
02:05:13,831 --> 02:05:16,110
I saw my little girl crying and you 
know,

2772
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:21,500
she's a grown up in.
I grew up in that world where people 

2773
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:21,500
getting smacked and you know,
I,

2774
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:24,900
she didn't grow up in that,
so I just said,

2775
02:05:24,901 --> 02:05:26,880
listen,
I'm never going to win this fucking war.

2776
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:32,510
This is going to be a war that I'm going
to either end up in jail or something 

2777
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:33,130
good and I'm going to kill one of these 
fucks.

2778
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:38,040
I might as well give company a shot.
What did I have to lose?

2779
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:42,570
It's this crazy thing that that was your
option and then think about all the shit

2780
02:05:42,571 --> 02:05:46,860
that you've been through now,
like thinking of yourself back then.

2781
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,830
You know,
I mean when you think about today,

2782
02:05:49,831 --> 02:05:53,310
like your life with your little daughter
and your wife and you know,

2783
02:05:53,670 --> 02:05:58,670
doing podcasts and doing all these shows
everywhere and then just thinking like 

2784
02:05:58,670 --> 02:05:59,960
holding someone hostage,
kidnapping them,

2785
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:04,110
robin a drug deal with the machine gun.
We just think that was you.

2786
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:06,810
It's,
it's weird because that's not you.

2787
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:08,390
You are not right now.
No,

2788
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:13,470
no,
but you have these memories of things 

2789
02:06:13,470 --> 02:06:15,801
that you did.
I used a weapon like four times to bust 

2790
02:06:15,801 --> 02:06:20,241
into drug dealer's house.
She's one of the things that could have 

2791
02:06:20,241 --> 02:06:20,241
happened.
Oh yeah,

2792
02:06:20,241 --> 02:06:23,960
easily.
And the other times I would just rob 

2793
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:24,860
them just because I don't give a fuck.
What are you going giving me?

2794
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:27,210
I'm just like thinking about that guy 
that pulled the knife on you.

2795
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:32,540
What if after you beat him,
he came back and tried to get you and 

2796
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:35,241
then escalated and next thing you know 
he stabbed him or he shot him or easily 

2797
02:06:35,241 --> 02:06:35,520
you could have murdered some.

2798
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:40,530
I was so confused at that time in 1919.
Everybody's confused at 19 but 19 and 

2799
02:06:43,110 --> 02:06:46,410
been through the shit that you're 
confused as I was.

2800
02:06:46,411 --> 02:06:48,170
I was really fucking confused.
So I,

2801
02:06:48,171 --> 02:06:49,410
I was,
you know,

2802
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:54,440
from I think till 20 something I wanted 
to kill my step dad and that was,

2803
02:06:55,170 --> 02:07:00,170
what was it?
That was all that was getting consumed 

2804
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:00,390
with me like that.
That was my consumption,

2805
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:06,140
like the pain that was going through 
without my mom the drugs and killing my 

2806
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:06,140
Stepdad,
Stepdad.

2807
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:08,220
But it wasn't about me.
My mom died without a will.

2808
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:11,310
My mom didn't leave a will,
so he took all the money,

2809
02:07:11,311 --> 02:07:13,230
all the jewelry.
He didn't give me a piece,

2810
02:07:13,231 --> 02:07:15,840
I didn't collect social security,
you know,

2811
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:17,780
uh,
I didn't get my,

2812
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:22,900
my real father died.
My real father was the first Cuban 

2813
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:23,170
committee man.
And you didn't city alright.

2814
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:28,340
And he was doing coke in 1966 and 
somebody gave him a package and it was 

2815
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:29,580
pure heroin.
They'll align to that.

2816
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:34,620
He died,
they took him to the hospital and they 

2817
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:34,620
never signed the death certificate in 
Union City,

2818
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,130
New Jersey.
So they forced

2819
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:38,830
my mother to take him back to Cuba in 
1967.

2820
02:07:38,831 --> 02:07:41,590
My mom had to take my dad,
my dad's buried and cube.

2821
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,840
Wow.
We guess what?

2822
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:46,290
My Dad got an insurance policy and the 
debt,

2823
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:51,750
the car,
and I never signed the death 

2824
02:07:51,750 --> 02:07:54,241
certificate,
so I never got that prudential 

2825
02:07:54,241 --> 02:07:57,841
insurance.
Plus my mom owned property with Miami 

2826
02:07:57,841 --> 02:08:01,950
airport is my mom had that property with
200 drug partners where that fucking 

2827
02:08:02,831 --> 02:08:05,320
thing was.
And I didn't get my cut from that.

2828
02:08:05,321 --> 02:08:10,321
So I wanted to kill the guy.
So for years that was my whole thing.

2829
02:08:10,781 --> 02:08:15,781
You know,
when I went to Colorado and hooked up 

2830
02:08:15,781 --> 02:08:17,491
with Fred,
he taught me how to shoot and not a 

2831
02:08:17,491 --> 02:08:17,491
fucking,
you know,

2832
02:08:17,491 --> 02:08:21,120
shoot a fucking rifle and measure 
distance and all that shit they do on 

2833
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:21,120
TV.
That was me.

2834
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:23,560
What did your step dad say?
Did you ever talk to him?

2835
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,550
We ended up talking and shit.
You know what man?

2836
02:08:27,551 --> 02:08:32,551
He was the type of person he was and I 
wasn't going to get shit and after 

2837
02:08:32,551 --> 02:08:33,940
awhile I accepted it.
I was like,

2838
02:08:33,941 --> 02:08:36,160
you know what?
I'm putting too much stock into this.

2839
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:38,500
Fuck this.
I'm going to go make my own money.

2840
02:08:38,850 --> 02:08:43,850
Do you know what I'm saying?
Like sometimes we get stuck and I'm 

2841
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:46,651
happy I didn't get no money because I 
wouldn't have been the person I am 

2842
02:08:46,651 --> 02:08:46,651
today.
Yeah,

2843
02:08:46,651 --> 02:08:47,620
I'm happy I didn't get any money.
And that funding,

2844
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:52,780
that's one of the worst things you can 
do is like winning the lottery or get a 

2845
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,230
big inheritance.
You would think it hasn't been big.

2846
02:08:53,231 --> 02:08:58,231
Inheritance would be amazing for you.
It's one of the worst things that can 

2847
02:08:58,231 --> 02:09:01,231
happen in terms of like your ambition.
If you're in the middle of doing 

2848
02:09:01,231 --> 02:09:03,160
something,
you've got some ideas or maybe you don't

2849
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:05,610
know what you want to do and you need to
find something,

2850
02:09:05,670 --> 02:09:10,670
you're hungry and all of a sudden you 
just get a giant chunk of money and 

2851
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:14,350
buying things and your ambitions gone.

2852
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:20,450
You don't know what to do.
I don't mind giving somebody start 

2853
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:20,450
startup money.
You know you have to give you a child.

2854
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:22,330
Some type of startup money,
son wrong with that,

2855
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:24,640
but I'm talking about like winning the 
lottery.

2856
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:29,720
Like people win the lottery.
It's like there's a giant percentage of 

2857
02:09:30,341 --> 02:09:32,800
them that ruined their life.
Giant.

2858
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:35,440
Like they've done all these studies on 
people winning the lottery.

2859
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:37,540
So what is it?
Because I'm giving you a bunch of money.

2860
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:42,100
You didn't earn it like I'm giving you a
bunch of money for sure.

2861
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:45,550
Like think about you and all the money 
that you've earned in your life.

2862
02:09:45,551 --> 02:09:47,500
You've earned it.
You do all these shows.

2863
02:09:47,501 --> 02:09:50,110
You've built up a successful standup 
career.

2864
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:53,980
You built up a successful podcasts.
You've done a lot of film and TV.

2865
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:57,000
You've worked,
you've worked right.

2866
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,750
You've gathered up and you make a good 
living.

2867
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:01,480
Now you know,
but this is all from work,

2868
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:03,070
right?
There's a buildup to it.

2869
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:05,890
It makes sense in your head.
There's an effort.

2870
02:10:05,891 --> 02:10:08,950
There's a reward for that effort.
There's motivation,

2871
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:12,280
there's disciplined is focused,
and then there's a payoff for all that.

2872
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:14,530
If you just get the payoff with no 
discipline,

2873
02:10:14,531 --> 02:10:16,180
no focus,
no lessons learned.

2874
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,420
It's just not a healthy way to exist.
It's terrible.

2875
02:10:19,421 --> 02:10:24,421
That's why rich kids are so fucked up.
Rich kids that grow up with trust funds 

2876
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:26,170
are all fucked.
Not all of them.

2877
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:31,620
A giant percentage of them are thought.
I knew a guy who was a rich guy and his 

2878
02:10:31,991 --> 02:10:33,920
parents were fucking billionaires

2879
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,030
and he grew up with two trust funds.
He burned through his first trust fund,

2880
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:43,330
fuck that up,
and then they had a backup trust fund 

2881
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:46,001
for forum.
He was buying houses and flipping them 

2882
02:10:46,001 --> 02:10:47,360
and losing money and investing in 
businesses and they all went under.

2883
02:10:47,361 --> 02:10:52,361
He had no discipline,
no understanding of what money really 

2884
02:10:52,361 --> 02:10:54,020
was and no hunger because he never had a
time in his life when he was poor.

2885
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:59,440
He never had a time in his life where 
he's worried about paying the bills and 

2886
02:10:59,440 --> 02:10:59,960
if you don't have that and you don't 
have that real motivation,

2887
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:02,870
I just don't think you ever really 
appreciate success.

2888
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:07,900
The people I think that appreciate 
success are the people that worked for 

2889
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:07,900
it.
You know what?

2890
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:09,950
You could remember back when you were 
poor,

2891
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:12,770
like I've had people say to me like,
why do you do so many jobs?

2892
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,910
Why do you have so many things you do?
Like,

2893
02:11:13,911 --> 02:11:14,330
what?
What?

2894
02:11:14,331 --> 02:11:16,010
Why do you keep moving?
Why do you do so much?

2895
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:19,850
Because I remember being scared.
I remember being broke.

2896
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:24,970
I remember having no idea where the fuck
the money was coming from and what my 

2897
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:26,540
future was going to be and I was always 
terrified of being a loser.

2898
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:31,220
That's that feeling of not succeeding is
what motivates you.

2899
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:35,300
That knowing that you failed in the past
and that you know,

2900
02:11:35,301 --> 02:11:39,790
there's been many times where like,
how many times do you bombed and you get

2901
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:40,430
off stage.
You're like,

2902
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:42,230
I can't do this.
I'm not a comedian.

2903
02:11:42,231 --> 02:11:47,231
I'm fucking terrible.
Like I got to figure out what the fuck 

2904
02:11:47,231 --> 02:11:47,420
I'm doing with my life.
If you don't go through those things,

2905
02:11:47,421 --> 02:11:52,421
if you don't have those experiences,
if you don't have those moments in your 

2906
02:11:52,421 --> 02:11:56,081
life where you're unsure of the future,
you're not going to have the real 

2907
02:11:56,081 --> 02:12:00,281
resolve that it takes to make it the 
grit and determination that it takes to 

2908
02:12:00,281 --> 02:12:01,970
move forward,
and if you don't have that,

2909
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:04,550
any success that you do have,
you're not gonna appreciate.

2910
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:06,950
Nothing comes easy and if it does come 
easy,

2911
02:12:06,951 --> 02:12:08,240
it's not.
You don't have it.

2912
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:11,790
You don't really have it.
Nothing comes easy so far.

2913
02:12:11,791 --> 02:12:14,610
They would never stick with Jujitsu.
If it was a mistake,

2914
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:20,670
I would've quit your job to have because
it's so hard because I would have 

2915
02:12:20,670 --> 02:12:20,670
thought I wouldn't be able to do it.
Yeah.

2916
02:12:20,670 --> 02:12:22,760
Once you try something new,
I can't do this,

2917
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:26,600
but we come.
How fucking scary.

2918
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:32,230
How weird is it that you want to chose a
career that basically for the first two 

2919
02:12:32,230 --> 02:12:34,460
years when not going to get a dime,
not a dime and no,

2920
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,870
no certainty at all.
Nobody understands that.

2921
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:38,980
Nobody understands that,
that that,

2922
02:12:38,981 --> 02:12:40,730
that you're not going to get a fucking 
job,

2923
02:12:40,731 --> 02:12:42,920
and not only that,
there's no pathway.

2924
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:46,400
It's like if you want to be a doctor,
you go to college,

2925
02:12:46,401 --> 02:12:48,260
you get a degree,
you go to medical school,

2926
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:49,250
you do your residency.

2927
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:51,530
There's a pathway.
That pathway is.

2928
02:12:51,570 --> 02:12:53,240
It's,
it's hard work.

2929
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:58,540
It's very difficult to do.
Not everyone's going to get through it 

2930
02:12:58,540 --> 02:12:58,880
successfully,
but at least there's a pathway.

2931
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:02,270
What the fuck is the pathway for being a
successful comedian?

2932
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:06,470
Your pathway is different than mine.
Mine's different than Jenkins,

2933
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:10,370
Duncan's or res.
We all have different pathways.

2934
02:13:10,670 --> 02:13:13,550
We all have different styles.
We all have different points of view.

2935
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:16,010
We all have different ways.
We deliver material.

2936
02:13:16,190 --> 02:13:19,010
We all have different ways of writing.
No one can tell you what to do.

2937
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,950
When you first got into this,
did you think of any success?

2938
02:13:22,130 --> 02:13:24,670
Honestly,
what did you think the outcome was going

2939
02:13:24,671 --> 02:13:25,640
to be?
Because for me,

2940
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:31,600
I thought that that was just going to be
a road comic and if I was an extra in 

2941
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:32,100
the movie,
that would be the best I would get.

2942
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,780
For me,
that's the honest truth.

2943
02:13:34,230 --> 02:13:39,230
Fitzsimmons and I was taught were 
talking about this recently goes 

2944
02:13:39,230 --> 02:13:39,230
fitzsimmons and I started out doing 
exactly the same time.

2945
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:42,720
Our number one goal was being a 
professional,

2946
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:45,030
like getting paid,
not having a day job.

2947
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:47,130
That was the goal.
Being able to pay your bills.

2948
02:13:47,131 --> 02:13:49,290
That was my goal.
That's not having a day job.

2949
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:52,400
I didn't care if I made $80,000,
$200 dollars.

2950
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:52,950
No,
there was no,

2951
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:53,580
no,
no,

2952
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:55,080
no.
There was no like,

2953
02:13:55,081 --> 02:13:59,220
I want to buy a mansion or I just want 
to be happy,

2954
02:13:59,530 --> 02:14:04,530
be happy.
I didn't want a day job and I knew one 

2955
02:14:04,530 --> 02:14:06,960
other thing.
When I got in that car in June of 95 and

2956
02:14:06,961 --> 02:14:11,060
I got on 30th street in boulder and I 
headed out on the Irish.

2957
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:14,010
There's a gas station there and that 
probably had.

2958
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:17,730
When I took my [inaudible] that I left 
on the thing of a triple running.

2959
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:21,150
You know that right?
That's where you left Colorado.

2960
02:14:22,130 --> 02:14:27,130
People with triple right.
I met a girl in Michigan that was nasty 

2961
02:14:27,130 --> 02:14:28,440
little dirty girl,
white girl,

2962
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:31,500
caroline,
and then she came to Colorado.

2963
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:36,560
Threw me a little dose of that monkey 
got me all crazy and then she went to 

2964
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:40,131
Seattle.
I was having so many problems in Denver 

2965
02:14:40,131 --> 02:14:42,420
that it just.
There was no listen.

2966
02:14:42,421 --> 02:14:45,690
I love my little girl.
I believed that I could have been a good

2967
02:14:45,691 --> 02:14:47,340
dad.
It just wasn't going to work.

2968
02:14:47,730 --> 02:14:49,520
It just wasn't going to work.
This was going on,

2969
02:14:49,550 --> 02:14:51,530
got this,
was not going to end good.

2970
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:57,080
This and all I kept seeing was that 
picture Mickey Rourke at the end of the 

2971
02:14:57,080 --> 02:15:01,430
fucking angel heart when he's sitting 
there smoking a cigarette with a razor 

2972
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:01,590
in his hand,
blood all over him.

2973
02:15:01,591 --> 02:15:03,360
That's all I kept thinking about.
I go,

2974
02:15:03,361 --> 02:15:08,361
you know what,
I'm looking to go to Seattle for the 

2975
02:15:08,361 --> 02:15:08,361
summer.

2976
02:15:08,361 --> 02:15:09,720
Hanging out with this broad.
But in my heart I knew I wasn't going to

2977
02:15:09,721 --> 02:15:14,721
come back.
I knew I wasn't going to come back so 

2978
02:15:14,721 --> 02:15:14,721
much that I had two licenses.
You know,

2979
02:15:14,721 --> 02:15:19,510
you buy out,
you know how you lose the license and 

2980
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:20,550
then one day you find it and by that 
time you've already got licensed.

2981
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:25,660
Yeah.
I must have had like $69 on me when I 

2982
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:25,710
left both and I had to get the Ogden,
Utah.

2983
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,790
That was my first road.
Greg ever for David Tribble Ogden,

2984
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:34,560
you dot?
I think it was like a 10 hour drive,

2985
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:39,770
maybe longer.
How long have you been doing standup at 

2986
02:15:39,770 --> 02:15:39,770
that point?

2987
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:42,810
Two years.
So you had started in Denver?

2988
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:46,350
I started in [inaudible] 91 and now it's
95.

2989
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:51,230
But you got to remember from 91 to 93.
That was part like convict.

2990
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:54,440
I sold volumes.
You want to buy coke?

2991
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:59,480
Meet me at the broker.
I saw you a coke when I'm doing 10 

2992
02:15:59,480 --> 02:15:59,480
minutes.
I didn't write.

2993
02:15:59,480 --> 02:15:59,850
I didn't really know anything about 
comedy.

2994
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:05,360
I just knew I wanted to be a comic.
I had a business card and I told people 

2995
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:05,610
I was going to be a comedian.
I was just lying.

2996
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:11,540
But then I did a stint in New York for 
nine months in 93 and that's where I 

2997
02:16:12,451 --> 02:16:15,540
really got a hint.
I took a standup comedy class.

2998
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:20,370
You ready for this?
The guy took the standup comedy class in

2999
02:16:20,371 --> 02:16:25,371
New York Comedy Club in 1993.
I trained with him now with Jujitsu,

3000
02:16:25,770 --> 02:16:29,170
really moved to boulder.
He's a comedy writer in town.

3001
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,770
First couple times I went in there.
He's my aides.

3002
02:16:31,790 --> 02:16:33,880
Will bolt oldest.
Fuck he,

3003
02:16:33,881 --> 02:16:38,020
I think he's two years older than me.
He's got white hair and when they I go,

3004
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:41,020
he kept calling himself frank,
frank,

3005
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:41,830
frank,
frank,

3006
02:16:41,831 --> 02:16:45,370
and I'm on top of them and I go,
you fucking leave frank.

3007
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:48,520
I took your writing course.
I never forgot what.

3008
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:53,550
Wow.
You realize why you were rolling with 

3009
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:53,550
them while I was rolling with him.

3010
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:59,010
When he told me he was friends with you,
he opened for you at the tree house.

3011
02:16:59,410 --> 02:17:01,440
A greenery or something?
Connecticut?

3012
02:17:01,441 --> 02:17:03,520
Yeah.
He worked with you up study.

3013
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:04,900
So now what?
Tight.

3014
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:09,930
Now if I see him in Jujitsu,
we talk about comedy and so I took his 

3015
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:11,110
stand when I took his stand up comedy 
class.

3016
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,540
That's when it hit because you said 
something that hit home.

3017
02:17:13,541 --> 02:17:14,260
He goes,
stand up.

3018
02:17:14,261 --> 02:17:17,860
Comedy is how your world collides with 
the restaurant world.

3019
02:17:17,930 --> 02:17:21,480
Plain and simple and I took that home 
and I thought about it.

3020
02:17:21,481 --> 02:17:22,900
I'm like,
fuck it makes sense,

3021
02:17:23,370 --> 02:17:25,630
and then a week later I wanted to.
Your old triple win.

3022
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:31,780
Let me old triple in that.
Yea old triple m is a fucking dive that 

3023
02:17:32,441 --> 02:17:37,441
used to do an open mic from midnight to 
four in the morning in like alcohol 

3024
02:17:38,531 --> 02:17:40,920
Ville.
Whereas alcohol bill out of door.

3025
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:44,770
Can you look it up?
It's online but it's closed.

3026
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:48,010
What places in Manhattan?
It's not there anymore.

3027
02:17:48,011 --> 02:17:49,270
You'll see it.
Yea.

3028
02:17:49,271 --> 02:17:52,330
Old triple in and it did open mics.
The yes,

3029
02:17:52,331 --> 02:17:56,770
people fall asleep at 12.
Like I will drive a limo then,

3030
02:17:57,510 --> 02:18:02,510
so I will get that equality.
12 sign my name up and the guy would go 

3031
02:18:02,510 --> 02:18:02,510
three hours.

3032
02:18:03,470 --> 02:18:05,780
I got to come back in three hours.
It's midnight.

3033
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:09,050
So I would take the limo,
go to Harlem,

3034
02:18:09,051 --> 02:18:14,051
buy a package of coke maybe by refresh.
Then I would go there and do my last 

3035
02:18:14,631 --> 02:18:17,120
spot for the night.
Lucky old triple and wow,

3036
02:18:17,121 --> 02:18:22,121
look at that place or this place.
They had an open mic there from 12 to 

3037
02:18:22,121 --> 02:18:24,740
four in the morning looking that.
It's crazy,

3038
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:28,640
so I go in at 1:00
PM to 4:00

3039
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:29,750
AM.
Holy Shit,

3040
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:34,340
this is 1993.
I got nothing going on.

3041
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:36,560
I'm depressed.
I'm driving a limo.

3042
02:18:36,561 --> 02:18:41,561
I'm snorting coke every night.
I'm living on a little cot and I go in 

3043
02:18:41,561 --> 02:18:43,280
there when they who's in there bro,
but John Leguizamo

3044
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:50,060
and he's on stage just talking,
but when I was sitting there watching 

3045
02:18:50,060 --> 02:18:54,811
them,
but I noticed something that there was 

3046
02:18:54,811 --> 02:18:56,071
eight people in the audience,
but in his world it was massive square 

3047
02:18:56,071 --> 02:18:59,671
garden like he didn't give a fuck.
Joe Is that when you do a comedy store 

3048
02:18:59,671 --> 02:19:02,590
late and this six people and people you 
got to offer and you're like.

3049
02:19:02,591 --> 02:19:07,591
People like that was great.
Pro Show was great because I have may 

3050
02:19:07,591 --> 02:19:07,591
believe I was at the God.
Yeah,

3051
02:19:07,591 --> 02:19:08,980
if you think about six people at the 
store,

3052
02:19:08,981 --> 02:19:11,170
you're not going to be you.
You can't think about it that way.

3053
02:19:11,171 --> 02:19:12,970
You know,
when Paul Mooney,

3054
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:17,080
like when Paul Mooney always intimidated
the shit out of me because I always knew

3055
02:19:17,081 --> 02:19:22,081
that he was a writer for prior and he 
was like the elder statesman of the 

3056
02:19:22,081 --> 02:19:23,820
comedy store back in [inaudible] 94 when
I first started there in.

3057
02:19:23,830 --> 02:19:27,890
I always had this feeling around him.
Like I was always nervous around him,

3058
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:28,040
you

3059
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:33,040
know,
and when I first started there I was 

3060
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:33,710
this young white guy in my twenties.
I wasn't very good,

3061
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:34,670
you know,
I didn't,

3062
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:36,680
I didn't get any respect from him,
you know.

3063
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:40,460
And then one day he saw me doing a late 
night spot,

3064
02:19:40,461 --> 02:19:45,461
like 1:00
in the morning and there was only like 

3065
02:19:45,461 --> 02:19:45,461
fucking 15,
20 people in the audience.

3066
02:19:45,461 --> 02:19:48,260
But I was just doing my best.
I was doing,

3067
02:19:48,261 --> 02:19:50,510
I was doing it and,
and I heard the back of the room

3068
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:59,470
laughing.
He was laughing and my shit and then I 

3069
02:19:59,470 --> 02:20:01,210
got off stage and he came up to me after
the show and he goes,

3070
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:03,310
he goes,
you are a real comic.

3071
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:04,780
He goes,
you did that show.

3072
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:07,480
Like it was a pack motherfucking room.
That's it.

3073
02:20:07,510 --> 02:20:09,190
And he goes,
and you killed those people.

3074
02:20:09,250 --> 02:20:10,630
He goes,
you killed those people.

3075
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:12,870
He goes,
you are real motherfucking comment.

3076
02:20:12,970 --> 02:20:15,820
And he walked away and I remember 
feeling so good.

3077
02:20:16,030 --> 02:20:20,350
Like I can't believe Paul Mooney just 
gave me a compliment.

3078
02:20:20,380 --> 02:20:22,750
Like he told me I was a real comic like 
I was in.

3079
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:25,930
And then ever since then give me hugs.
Every time he saw me,

3080
02:20:26,510 --> 02:20:27,750
you know,
and this is like,

3081
02:20:27,940 --> 02:20:31,780
you get that pat on the back that you 
know that thumbs up from someone who you

3082
02:20:31,781 --> 02:20:34,030
respect that that means the world.
Man,

3083
02:20:34,031 --> 02:20:36,130
that's gigantic.
That's so huge.

3084
02:20:36,730 --> 02:20:38,410
I mean when,
when someone does that to you,

3085
02:20:38,411 --> 02:20:41,740
that the just the,
the wind in your sails,

3086
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:44,760
it just can take you to a totally 
different place because you,

3087
02:20:44,761 --> 02:20:46,870
you got the,
you got the stamp,

3088
02:20:47,110 --> 02:20:49,150
you know,
you got a stamp of approval from someone

3089
02:20:49,151 --> 02:20:51,740
who's real.
Forget

3090
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:56,740
that.
I didn't know the power of the comedy 

3091
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:56,740
store like I had.
No,

3092
02:20:56,740 --> 02:21:00,431
I read about it.
I heard about it from you and other 

3093
02:21:00,431 --> 02:21:02,801
people.
I did Miami with Moody with this.

3094
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:08,720
This has to be,
oh baby,

3095
02:21:08,990 --> 02:21:10,280
2000,
three,

3096
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:13,750
2004.
And uh,

3097
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:16,430
I opened for him.
You know,

3098
02:21:16,490 --> 02:21:21,490
it's a two man show.
It's just me and him at the Miami 

3099
02:21:21,490 --> 02:21:22,370
Improv.
I'm onstage and I just happened to catch

3100
02:21:22,371 --> 02:21:23,540
a fucking,
uh,

3101
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:25,480
I just happened to catch a fucking,
you know,

3102
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:27,650
the energy thing when you just kill it.
Well,

3103
02:21:27,651 --> 02:21:32,651
you,
you used to crush the air because you 

3104
02:21:32,651 --> 02:21:32,651
would do half your punchlines and 
Spanish.

3105
02:21:32,651 --> 02:21:33,710
I'm killing killing them,
killing them.

3106
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:38,780
But I'm being dirty and I hear the door 
open and Paul Mooney.

3107
02:21:38,781 --> 02:21:42,390
I could see him walking in and he looks 
at me and I'm killing it.

3108
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:43,980
I'm having a good set.
He's killing me,

3109
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:44,510
looking at me.

3110
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:49,100
And he went out in the hallway and the 
door was open and he kept yelling to the

3111
02:21:49,101 --> 02:21:50,830
staff,
looking at.

3112
02:21:50,930 --> 02:21:51,740
I'm like,
fuck,

3113
02:21:51,741 --> 02:21:53,420
maybe I'm being too dirty.
Right?

3114
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:57,440
Maybe he's going to complain about me.
How can Paul Mooney complain about?

3115
02:21:57,550 --> 02:21:59,320
They taught me this isn't true,
right?

3116
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:04,600
I've been,
I've known him from the store for five 

3117
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:04,600
fucking years.
Tommy,

3118
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:04,610
he's not out there going,
I'm too dirty and shit.

3119
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:07,910
But when I got out there,
he hugged me when he came up,

3120
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:10,040
can't keep it going.
What time?

3121
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:12,110
My little brother got off the stage and 
I go,

3122
02:22:12,350 --> 02:22:13,460
what happened on a.
He was.

3123
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:17,120
He was back there yelling,
fuck the fucking Improv's.

3124
02:22:17,650 --> 02:22:19,120
You don't taught him how to be like 
that.

3125
02:22:19,121 --> 02:22:21,860
That's Mitzi shore by the that.
That's the comedy store.

3126
02:22:22,190 --> 02:22:24,410
He was back there yelling that the 
comedy store,

3127
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:26,370
you went promise.
You don't develop

3128
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:29,160
deck.
You listened to that.

3129
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:32,160
That's the comedy store.
That's what happens when you hang out at

3130
02:22:32,161 --> 02:22:37,161
the comedy store.
That's why that little fat motherfucker 

3131
02:22:37,161 --> 02:22:39,991
is killing because that's a fucking 
comedy store and that you know.

3132
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:42,360
You're right.
That feels tremendous.

3133
02:22:42,361 --> 02:22:43,710
One fucking.
He's in your corner.

3134
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:45,450
It feels great.
He's.

3135
02:22:46,170 --> 02:22:51,170
He was something special.
He would own the room to Paul Mooney 

3136
02:22:51,170 --> 02:22:51,870
would sit down.
It didn't matter what time he went up.

3137
02:22:52,090 --> 02:22:53,670
Didn't matter how many people in the 
audience.

3138
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:56,430
He would sit down.
He had a little tiny bottle of champagne

3139
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:59,790
and he would take his fucking time.
He would take his time.

3140
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:03,210
How crazy is that?
I learned so much from him.

3141
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:04,950
Oh yeah.
How to control a room,

3142
02:23:05,130 --> 02:23:07,240
how to control,
not control rule,

3143
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:12,260
meaning like you're a control freak,
but how to get everybody to pay 

3144
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:16,311
attention and lock into your thoughts.
Like he didn't try to do a song and a 

3145
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:20,010
dance or people look at me,
look at me,

3146
02:23:20,011 --> 02:23:20,430
look at me.

3147
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:23,520
He would just command presence with 
excellence.

3148
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:27,060
His material was excellent.
His delivery was excellent.

3149
02:23:27,061 --> 02:23:32,061
He was calm and composed and you just 
always felt like you were trying too 

3150
02:23:32,161 --> 02:23:33,720
hard.
When you would watch him.

3151
02:23:33,721 --> 02:23:38,721
He like,
I gotta figure out a way that he's 

3152
02:23:38,721 --> 02:23:38,721
doing.
You're right.

3153
02:23:38,721 --> 02:23:38,721
That's what he did teach.
Yeah.

3154
02:23:38,721 --> 02:23:38,940
Beginning.
You give a fuck.

3155
02:23:39,090 --> 02:23:41,370
He didn't give a fuck,
but he licked legitimately didn't give a

3156
02:23:41,371 --> 02:23:42,690
fuck.
Boy,

3157
02:23:42,691 --> 02:23:47,691
that guy got stole from a lot.
A lot.

3158
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:51,930
Men used to steal all his shit.
Switch out the word Nigger,

3159
02:23:51,931 --> 02:23:56,931
put in the word Mexican.
Switch it up about star wars and about 

3160
02:23:56,931 --> 02:23:57,930
this and about that.
He just.

3161
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:01,740
And you would see the different because 
moonee would go on after men see it too,

3162
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:04,590
like been sealed.
Would go on before him and to his shit.

3163
02:24:04,591 --> 02:24:07,010
And then moonee would go on afterwards,
you can give a fuck,

3164
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:07,980
just did a shit.

3165
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:10,650
But he knew it.
He would be very frustrated by it,

3166
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:12,870
you know,
he was a,

3167
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:18,020
it was a big influence to a lot of us 
that got to see and watch him because we

3168
02:24:18,811 --> 02:24:21,180
all knew his history.
I mean,

3169
02:24:21,181 --> 02:24:26,181
he was one of the head writers for 
arguably the greatest comedian of all 

3170
02:24:26,181 --> 02:24:27,150
time,
you know?

3171
02:24:27,380 --> 02:24:30,020
I mean,
he was one of the feel.

3172
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:31,380
Yeah,
Richard Pryor.

3173
02:24:31,410 --> 02:24:36,410
You'd think that I feel it too.
But if there's a big argument or that 

3174
02:24:36,410 --> 02:24:40,800
argument with the other dude who had all
those specials,

3175
02:24:41,010 --> 02:24:43,500
which is I can't think of as George 
Carlin's.

3176
02:24:43,501 --> 02:24:48,501
Yeah,
I think I can give you the nod.

3177
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:50,160
To me,
it's clear.

3178
02:24:50,161 --> 02:24:51,450
It's clear as day.
It's not.

3179
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:54,030
This is not a knock on George Carlin,
who was a great comedian.

3180
02:24:54,031 --> 02:24:58,620
He's a great comedian.
George Carlin to me was more of a social

3181
02:24:58,621 --> 02:25:00,540
spokesman,
like he was a,

3182
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:04,590
a social commentator and he was a very 
great comedian as well.

3183
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:09,590
He had some funny material for sure.
But George Carlin did a special every 

3184
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,750
year.
Every year.

3185
02:25:09,751 --> 02:25:12,810
He did a special and I think,
you know,

3186
02:25:12,811 --> 02:25:17,811
his body of work is certainly larger 
than anybody else's and he's certainly 

3187
02:25:17,811 --> 02:25:22,071
one of the all time greats,
but to me there was something about 

3188
02:25:22,071 --> 02:25:25,521
prior that was just so special and 
unique and powerful and just just 

3189
02:25:26,741 --> 02:25:27,850
resonated.
Man.

3190
02:25:27,851 --> 02:25:30,790
I never,
I'll never forget listening to his stuff

3191
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:34,690
when I was a little kid.
Me and my girlfriend in high school,

3192
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:40,590
I think I was like 16.
She was 15 and we were in my room 

3193
02:25:40,590 --> 02:25:44,881
listening to Richard Pryor on a cassette
and just cry and laugh and sitting on my

3194
02:25:45,041 --> 02:25:47,320
bed,
laugh and laugh and,

3195
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:50,530
and I'll never forget.
I'll never forget going to see him.

3196
02:25:50,531 --> 02:25:55,531
My parents took me to see live on the 
sunset strip when I was like 14 or 13 or

3197
02:25:56,861 --> 02:25:57,610
something like that.

3198
02:25:57,880 --> 02:26:02,880
I'll never forget being in that movie 
theater laughing so fucking hard and 

3199
02:26:03,311 --> 02:26:07,270
looking around at people like walking 
back and forth on their chairs.

3200
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:11,740
And all I remember thinking is,
I can't believe this guy's just talking.

3201
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:14,810
Like I'd seen all these amazing movies 
like,

3202
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:17,920
you know,
back to school or stripes or you know,

3203
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:20,650
name the comedy movies that you've seen 
all these years.

3204
02:26:20,651 --> 02:26:23,470
I saw all these comedy movies that were 
great and funny,

3205
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:26,920
but they were never this funny.
Like this guy's just talking.

3206
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:31,980
I'm like,
this has got to be the funniest shit of 

3207
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:34,171
all time.
And he's just talking and especially 

3208
02:26:34,171 --> 02:26:34,171
when.
Yes,

3209
02:26:34,171 --> 02:26:34,570
this is 82.
Okay.

3210
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:37,630
So I guess I was 15,
so it's 14 or 15.

3211
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:40,750
That's when it came out was 82,
so I was 15.

3212
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:46,740
So watching this as a teenager,
it planted the seed in my head like,

3213
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:48,640
Holy Shit.

3214
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:52,210
Like how is it possible that this guy 
can do this?

3215
02:26:52,211 --> 02:26:57,211
That he can just talk and that talking 
and just explaining your life 

3216
02:26:58,361 --> 02:27:03,361
experiences can be so hilarious.
That's the seed that was planted in my 

3217
02:27:03,361 --> 02:27:03,361
head.
I mean,

3218
02:27:03,361 --> 02:27:05,170
I never thought I was going to be a 
comedian.

3219
02:27:05,171 --> 02:27:07,300
I never,
never had any aspirations.

3220
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:08,770
You know,
my friend,

3221
02:27:08,771 --> 02:27:10,210
Dr Steve.
Steve Graham?

3222
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:11,890
Yes.
He just called me.

3223
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:16,090
We just communicated.
I'm still one of my best friends to this

3224
02:27:16,090 --> 02:27:21,090
day and will be to the dad died because 
that guy is the guy who talked me into 

3225
02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:22,390
doing comedy.
I was training.

3226
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:26,830
That's when I was competing and I just 
loved comedy as a thing.

3227
02:27:26,831 --> 02:27:31,831
I just loved comedy and I would always 
make fun of people and do like 

3228
02:27:31,831 --> 02:27:32,560
impressions of people having sex,
like our friends.

3229
02:27:32,561 --> 02:27:33,280
Like,
like,

3230
02:27:33,281 --> 02:27:38,281
you know,
I would just try to make everybody 

3231
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:38,281
laugh,
you know,

3232
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:38,410
and we're all gathered around the locker
room.

3233
02:27:38,410 --> 02:27:43,410
Everybody would be nervous before 
sparring or everybody be nervous when 

3234
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:44,590
we're on our way to fights and 
tournaments and stuff like that.

3235
02:27:44,591 --> 02:27:49,591
I would be the guy that made everybody 
laugh and he pulled me aside and he just

3236
02:27:50,831 --> 02:27:52,780
said,
you could be a comedian.

3237
02:27:53,260 --> 02:27:55,150
Like you're really funny.
He's like,

3238
02:27:55,151 --> 02:27:56,260
you could really do this.
And I said,

3239
02:27:57,130 --> 02:27:59,620
I remember saying,
you think I'm funny because you like me.

3240
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:04,740
I go,
other people are gonna think I'm an 

3241
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:04,740
asshole.
I say fucked up things.

3242
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:06,340
Like I say fucked up things because I'm 
around all these savages.

3243
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:11,700
You know,
I'm around like Leroy Rodriguez and I 

3244
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:12,610
had a friend named major battle that was
his name.

3245
02:28:12,730 --> 02:28:16,420
His real name was major battle.
He was one of a j dot Kim's black belts,

3246
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:22,140
Larry Jones,
all these guys were savages and they 

3247
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:22,140
were just fighters,
you know,

3248
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:27,010
and so I could say fucked up things 
around them because they were used to 

3249
02:28:27,010 --> 02:28:30,851
kick and people in the head and they're 
used to fighting and tournaments and 

3250
02:28:30,851 --> 02:28:34,720
taken,
taken bus trips to go kick the shit out 

3251
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:34,720
of people.

3252
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:35,660
I mean that was what they did.
That's what everybody did back then.

3253
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:40,870
So the way I felt about it was like I'm 
making a group of very crazy people 

3254
02:28:42,021 --> 02:28:43,460
laugh.
Like these are like,

3255
02:28:43,461 --> 02:28:45,120
we're all misfits,
you know,

3256
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:50,380
we were all like people that didn't fit 
in in a normal world because we were 

3257
02:28:50,541 --> 02:28:55,541
just fighting and I'm like,
they'll laugh because they're crazy and 

3258
02:28:55,731 --> 02:28:59,420
they're all punching people and kicking 
people and this is a different world.

3259
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:04,680
I'm like,
other people are not going to think I'm 

3260
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:06,191
funny.
But he talked me into it and so from 

3261
02:29:06,191 --> 02:29:07,580
there I started writing some stuff down.
I waited about six months until I turned

3262
02:29:07,581 --> 02:29:11,520
21.
I went to an open mic and then uh,

3263
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:15,260
after I turned 21,
like maybe,

3264
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:17,870
what is it?
Sixteen days later I went onstage.

3265
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:19,790
I turned 21,
August 11,

3266
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:23,630
1988 and then August 27th I went 
onstage.

3267
02:29:24,710 --> 02:29:25,880
Wow.
Yeah.

3268
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:30,480
But that was just 100 percent.
Someone telling me to do it 100 percent.

3269
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:35,600
I always loved it.
I used to watch evening at the Improv 

3270
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:35,600
and I would always watch stand up on the
tonight show,

3271
02:29:35,670 --> 02:29:37,920
but I just loved it like the way I like 
music now,

3272
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:43,160
you know,
like I love watching music or listening 

3273
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:43,160
to music.
I don't have any talent,

3274
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:44,820
I don't have any aspirations,
but I love,

3275
02:29:44,910 --> 02:29:47,010
I just love music.
To me it's just,

3276
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:49,890
it does something to me.
It makes me feel good.

3277
02:29:49,891 --> 02:29:51,090
I'm a fan of it,
you know,

3278
02:29:51,150 --> 02:29:54,390
I'm a fan of a lot of shit that I'll 
never do but stand up.

3279
02:29:54,391 --> 02:29:56,190
It was just one of those things like I 
just love it

3280
02:29:56,230 --> 02:30:00,290
doing it and I would,
you know,

3281
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:05,640
it would just be my number one source of
release as far as like a entertainment.

3282
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:08,070
It's funny that you say that about words

3283
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:13,130
because for me I was listening to the 
Beatles with my buddy and he had an 

3284
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:17,340
older brother that was a junkie.
That's how I discovered Richard Pryor.

3285
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:22,700
Oh really?
We were listening to the Beatles like I 

3286
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:23,160
want to hold.
And then went like,

3287
02:30:23,161 --> 02:30:25,500
this is cool.
And his brother came and said,

3288
02:30:25,501 --> 02:30:27,420
what the fuck?
You faggots listened to them.

3289
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:29,880
We're like,
we'll listen to the Beatles,

3290
02:30:29,881 --> 02:30:30,900
you know,
we're all excited.

3291
02:30:30,901 --> 02:30:32,370
And he's like,
take that shit off.

3292
02:30:33,210 --> 02:30:38,210
They took this album cover out with a 
black dude on it and also they put some 

3293
02:30:38,210 --> 02:30:42,621
on.
I hear this fucking laughter and I'm 

3294
02:30:42,621 --> 02:30:44,451
like,
what the fuck is this shit all a sudden 

3295
02:30:44,451 --> 02:30:44,451
come and kind of say Richard Pryor and 
you're like,

3296
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:49,280
and after that first side I was done.
Like once I heard the wine,

3297
02:30:49,300 --> 02:30:50,460
Oh,
meets Dracula,

3298
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:54,900
is it something?
I said that's what that was my.

3299
02:30:54,970 --> 02:30:58,810
I don't know if it's the niggas crazy.
Why don't meet Dracula.

3300
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:02,360
I don't know what I'm exactly a to 
track.

3301
02:31:02,550 --> 02:31:05,940
It's something I said or the Nigga is 
crazy.

3302
02:31:05,970 --> 02:31:07,710
Those are the two ounces.
I don't know which one.

3303
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:10,710
When I heard the last cut on it,
which is the wine.

3304
02:31:10,711 --> 02:31:11,700
Oh,
meets Dracula.

3305
02:31:11,940 --> 02:31:14,430
I was hooked.
I left it.

3306
02:31:14,431 --> 02:31:19,431
I bought the album.
I brought it home that I bought 

3307
02:31:19,431 --> 02:31:20,020
bicentennial Nigga and there's a friend 
of my

3308
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:24,360
ray Canelo who I still talk to her.
He was a vp of a Scifi and he goes,

3309
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:29,400
do you still remember coming home?
My house in the sixth grade and your 

3310
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:32,511
mother catching this listening to his 
mother and I wasn't allowed in the 

3311
02:31:32,511 --> 02:31:32,511
house.
He goes,

3312
02:31:32,511 --> 02:31:35,370
don't you remember that shit?
We used to have a band.

3313
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:38,040
I used to be a singer in this band in 
sixth grade,

3314
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:41,970
a canal,
a dealer and John Bender.

3315
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,770
What kind of music?
The Beatles.

3316
02:31:44,970 --> 02:31:46,500
The Beatles.
I want to hold your hand.

3317
02:31:46,501 --> 02:31:48,510
Help.
I need somebody.

3318
02:31:49,240 --> 02:31:52,200
Yeah,
the Niggas put that nigger's crazy.

3319
02:31:52,201 --> 02:31:57,201
Look at the title.
They put like an asterisk where the eye 

3320
02:31:57,201 --> 02:31:59,160
is like,
what the fuck is wrong with people,

3321
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:04,430
but meanwhile it says it on the album,
like they have the picture where you see

3322
02:32:04,561 --> 02:32:07,310
him on the album and it says Nig,
g,

3323
02:32:07,311 --> 02:32:08,050
e,
r,

3324
02:32:08,310 --> 02:32:12,000
but then they have the actual title for 
sale.

3325
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,270
What's the website?
This was LP.

3326
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:16,950
Oh,
that's an LP.

3327
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:19,050
You can get that in final.
Oh yeah.

3328
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:22,770
Wow.
Look at that face to young then man.

3329
02:32:22,771 --> 02:32:24,420
He's like in his thirties.
God,

3330
02:32:24,421 --> 02:32:27,000
he was good.
See to me it's like I have,

3331
02:32:27,030 --> 02:32:29,490
this is my version of um,
my,

3332
02:32:29,491 --> 02:32:34,491
like evolutionary charter comedy.
I think the guy who started it all off 

3333
02:32:34,491 --> 02:32:34,491
is lenny bruce.
We too.

3334
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:38,640
So I have Lenny Bruce posters framed on 
my wall.

3335
02:32:38,850 --> 02:32:41,550
I mean like I just feel like I don't 
like,

3336
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:46,640
I don't enjoy watching him or listening 
to him as much because I don't think he 

3337
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:51,351
was as good today because I think that 
the culture was so different back then 

3338
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:54,310
that it's not,
it's very difficult for us to,

3339
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:59,380
to sing like the things that he's saying
or not groundbreaking today because he 

3340
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:02,250
already broke that ground.
And then the culture shifted with it.

3341
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:04,410
I mean it's not just him,
but a lot of other people,

3342
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:09,560
a lot of other authors and politicians,
all these different people broke 

3343
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:10,020
different ground and culture's evolved 
since then.

3344
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:15,860
But I think Richard Pryor took what he 
did and the honesty that lenny bruce 

3345
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:19,710
exhibited on stage and he brought it to 
the next level.

3346
02:33:20,210 --> 02:33:21,780
You know,
he took it to a new place.

3347
02:33:22,110 --> 02:33:23,000
And I think that,
that,

3348
02:33:23,010 --> 02:33:28,010
that,
that happens a lot when people are 

3349
02:33:28,010 --> 02:33:30,441
influenced by other people.
I think that's one of the things that's 

3350
02:33:30,441 --> 02:33:30,780
really important,
the distinction between being influenced

3351
02:33:30,781 --> 02:33:32,340
and stealing,
you know,

3352
02:33:33,030 --> 02:33:38,030
I think we all influenced each other and
I know you guys influenced me like Ari 

3353
02:33:39,061 --> 02:33:42,420
and Dunkin and you and all of us 
together.

3354
02:33:42,490 --> 02:33:43,530
You know,
Tom,

3355
02:33:43,570 --> 02:33:48,570
Bert,
we influenced each other and we inspire 

3356
02:33:48,570 --> 02:33:50,820
each other and that when you see someone
do really good stuff,

3357
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:53,730
like you want to do more,
bird does it to me,

3358
02:33:53,731 --> 02:33:54,720
you know,
Louis,

3359
02:33:54,930 --> 02:33:57,330
you see someone doing really what 
Chappelle,

3360
02:33:57,420 --> 02:34:02,420
you see really good comedy,
you want to do more really good comedy 

3361
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:02,460
and everyone's sort of influencing 
everybody.

3362
02:34:03,090 --> 02:34:08,090
So I think that honesty that Lenny Bruce
expressed was so unique for the time,

3363
02:34:11,750 --> 02:34:15,950
if there was no one had ever done any 
sort of social commentary in,

3364
02:34:15,951 --> 02:34:16,500
in,
in a,

3365
02:34:16,510 --> 02:34:17,890
in a comedy form,

3366
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:23,370
the way that lenny had done so.
And then Richard Pryor took it and just 

3367
02:34:23,370 --> 02:34:23,800
blew it out of the water.
I mean,

3368
02:34:23,801 --> 02:34:28,030
Richard Pryor was raised in brothels.
He was raised in a brothel.

3369
02:34:28,031 --> 02:34:30,220
Joe,
he was raised in a whorehouse in Peoria,

3370
02:34:30,221 --> 02:34:31,570
Illinois.
I mean,

3371
02:34:31,571 --> 02:34:35,110
Richard Pryor was experiencing life in a
different way,

3372
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:40,400
you know,
in all his experiences with drugs and 

3373
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:40,720
craziness and wild people growing up.
And then,

3374
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:44,500
you know,
the comedy of the time shifting from the

3375
02:34:44,501 --> 02:34:49,501
sixties into the seventies,
it became this thing that he was at the 

3376
02:34:49,501 --> 02:34:50,980
forefront of.
And in my opinion,

3377
02:34:50,981 --> 02:34:53,650
he's like the most revolutionary figure 
in all comedy.

3378
02:34:53,890 --> 02:34:54,580
He's,
he,

3379
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:58,750
he was just so different and so unique 
and so polished.

3380
02:34:58,751 --> 02:34:59,860
You know,
I remember I was,

3381
02:34:59,861 --> 02:35:03,070
uh,
I was living with my roommates and like,

3382
02:35:03,710 --> 02:35:06,370
because it was like 87 or something like
that.

3383
02:35:06,680 --> 02:35:09,490
We had this place in,
in revere.

3384
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:11,980
We're all living together.
Wasn't malted Malt,

3385
02:35:12,380 --> 02:35:14,570
whatever the fuck we were were living 
in.

3386
02:35:14,571 --> 02:35:15,460
Oh No,
it was Lynn,

3387
02:35:15,550 --> 02:35:20,550
Lynn,
Massachusetts near the beach and we all 

3388
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:23,680
watched a Sam Kennison special,
which was hilarious.

3389
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:26,680
It was really funny.
But then we watched prior,

3390
02:35:26,950 --> 02:35:28,570
after we watched Kennison and we were 
like,

3391
02:35:28,571 --> 02:35:32,790
wow,
look how much smoother prior is like.

3392
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:35,230
That's what I remember thinking and I 
remember my friend bill,

3393
02:35:35,231 --> 02:35:38,950
he goes,
look how much more black polished he is.

3394
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:40,120
I'm like,
that's the word,

3395
02:35:40,121 --> 02:35:41,200
right?
It's like polished.

3396
02:35:41,201 --> 02:35:41,710
He's like,
yeah,

3397
02:35:41,711 --> 02:35:44,290
he's like smooth there.
He was smoother.

3398
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:47,170
He just had a,
a different sort of style.

3399
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:52,171
Whereas kinison was just kinison was 
just kickstart and everything and just 

3400
02:35:52,171 --> 02:35:53,770
fucking knock it.
I was going to see him coming,

3401
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:55,360
but let me.
What's his name?

3402
02:35:55,361 --> 02:35:57,850
What's the Lenny Bruce?
Lenny.

3403
02:35:57,851 --> 02:36:00,040
Bruce.
I don't think his materials outrageous,

3404
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:01,900
but I liked this cadence.

3405
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,850
Yeah,
man.

3406
02:36:03,890 --> 02:36:06,250
You do it man.
So I told the guy,

3407
02:36:06,251 --> 02:36:08,800
listen,
he's got some jokes that hold up.

3408
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:11,990
Listen to them.
Come back in a little while too,

3409
02:36:12,110 --> 02:36:14,850
because he said the word slut.
I don't know if you build to Wordsmith,

3410
02:36:15,110 --> 02:36:20,110
say snap is a great word because he's 
lovable and I like how they shot his 

3411
02:36:20,781 --> 02:36:23,410
specials.
I like how they shot him.

3412
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:25,150
I like,
I like that black and white.

3413
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:30,820
Somebody just gave me one of the towns.
Gave me him live from Carnegie Hall.

3414
02:36:31,570 --> 02:36:33,000
It's got.
Wow.

3415
02:36:34,370 --> 02:36:35,710
After a while you sit.
There you go.

3416
02:36:35,711 --> 02:36:38,660
Should I shoot myself?
But there's a couple pieces in there.

3417
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:41,710
Will you see it man?
I read that book that led.

3418
02:36:41,740 --> 02:36:44,470
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's a book that a great book to.

3419
02:36:44,471 --> 02:36:46,960
What about the hotel in New York and how
he.

3420
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:48,910
Oh yeah,
he did jazz music,

3421
02:36:49,110 --> 02:36:50,620
you know,
shooting heroin all day,

3422
02:36:50,621 --> 02:36:53,090
hanging out with aluminum foil on the 
window.

3423
02:36:53,091 --> 02:36:56,020
The windows have a copy of that.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3424
02:36:56,021 --> 02:36:58,300
let me boil that shit.
I love all this shit.

3425
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:00,540
That's what made me become a jail.

3426
02:37:04,050 --> 02:37:04,980
Bring it up,

3427
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:06,560
baby.

3428
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:12,030
Drink my wife still look good.
Standing up against this thing.

3429
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,830
The,
the lowest.

3430
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:19,670
I really put her down.
No,

3431
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:21,400
no.
I really met her.

3432
02:37:21,990 --> 02:37:26,740
I don't want some shock chick.
The can code and work with boys.

3433
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:31,310
I just want to hear my lady say,
get up and fix this thing.

3434
02:37:32,030 --> 02:37:37,030
It still making noise all along.
All along.

3435
02:37:38,430 --> 02:37:43,430
What the fuck is this?
He was just doing weird shout out.

3436
02:37:45,210 --> 02:37:47,220
He was,
he has a joke today.

3437
02:37:47,490 --> 02:37:51,930
It still holds up gay people.
He goes to say homosexuals.

3438
02:37:52,290 --> 02:37:57,290
He goes,
they lock him up in jail for being gay 

3439
02:37:57,290 --> 02:38:01,220
where they put them in there with a 
bunch of men who want to have sex with 

3440
02:38:01,220 --> 02:38:04,140
them.
Give you some volume on this.

3441
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:07,420
Well,
Elizabeth Hale a be combined Mitzvah'd

3442
02:38:14,370 --> 02:38:14,540
no

3443
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:16,970
is continuity.
I'll behave myself.

3444
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:20,240
I'll do all the lines where he hurts,
you know that the thing,

3445
02:38:20,241 --> 02:38:25,241
you know,
I have a reputation for being sort of 

3446
02:38:25,241 --> 02:38:28,980
controversial and irreverent and also 
the semantic bed trap of bed tape.

3447
02:38:29,570 --> 02:38:33,770
And actually I do have an.
I will always be accused of bad taste by

3448
02:38:33,771 --> 02:38:36,520
the people who eat in her service,
you know,

3449
02:38:36,530 --> 02:38:41,530
that kind of scene to anyone yet.
But you might be interested in how I 

3450
02:38:41,530 --> 02:38:45,731
became offensive.
Started in school with um,

3451
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:48,920
uh,
drinking.

3452
02:38:48,921 --> 02:38:51,050
And uh,
I was really,

3453
02:38:51,051 --> 02:38:52,910
I was like,
get real depressed kid.

3454
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:54,690
Seven,
eight years old.

3455
02:38:54,691 --> 02:38:59,691
And I really get juiced and get out of 
so the teacher would really get bugged 

3456
02:39:01,820 --> 02:39:06,820
me singing and carrying on calling 
Columbus of thing again.

3457
02:39:08,410 --> 02:39:13,410
And who's being Arand bar and then 
smoking.

3458
02:39:13,881 --> 02:39:15,590
I don't know if you can,
can you see that from him?

3459
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:20,680
I've got like,
I'm the 10th to hear fix your teeth.

3460
02:39:23,350 --> 02:39:23,950
I,
uh,

3461
02:39:25,130 --> 02:39:30,130
see I smoked Marlboros and that's six 
years old and I grew up there.

3462
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:38,090
The funny thing is that it's the mantic.
There are words that offend me.

3463
02:39:38,570 --> 02:39:40,160
Uh,
let's see.

3464
02:39:40,190 --> 02:39:43,670
Governor faubus segregation offend me.
Uh,

3465
02:39:44,380 --> 02:39:47,840
a nighttime television offends me.
Some nighttime.

3466
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:55,280
The show is that exploit homosexuality,
narcotics and prostitution under the 

3467
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:59,330
guides of helping these societal problem
in the,

3468
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:04,360
except for a few shows.
There's one guy on the coast who's got 

3469
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:05,420
like a sense of,
you may know his name is Paul Coats.

3470
02:40:05,421 --> 02:40:10,421
And he found out there were kids that 
eight and nine years old that was 

3471
02:40:10,700 --> 02:40:15,700
snipping airplane glue.
You get high on,

3472
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:17,490
you know,
and uh,

3473
02:40:19,700 --> 02:40:24,700
I had sort of a fantasy how it happened.
The kid is alone in his room and it's 

3474
02:40:24,751 --> 02:40:29,751
Saturday,
the child is played by George mccready 

3475
02:40:32,370 --> 02:40:37,330
to know him in the room and Saturday 
mothers away and wouldn't lie to you.

3476
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:39,410
That's good.
In hostels and led to the aisle.

3477
02:40:40,530 --> 02:40:42,270
I'll make an airplane.
That's good.

3478
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:45,440
It's hard to like.
You know what I'm saying?

3479
02:40:45,441 --> 02:40:48,350
It doesn't really translate today 
because we're just.

3480
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:52,400
This was irreverent and crazy back then,
but today we're like,

3481
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:55,040
hmm.
Very interesting.

3482
02:40:55,420 --> 02:40:58,040
He was getting.
He was doing his thing.

3483
02:40:58,220 --> 02:40:59,570
It's historic.
Right?

3484
02:40:59,571 --> 02:41:04,571
So you're watching this and you're 
hearing people laugh and you've got to 

3485
02:41:04,571 --> 02:41:04,571
put your.
It's,

3486
02:41:04,571 --> 02:41:08,170
it's impossible to enjoy this without 
understanding the context of the time 

3487
02:41:09,591 --> 02:41:11,990
that he was doing it.
Like you have to Kinda like put yourself

3488
02:41:11,991 --> 02:41:14,180
at the time were all this was taking 
place.

3489
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:17,390
Whereas I think prior stuff's still 
translates today.

3490
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:22,720
You know,
there's a lot of prior material that 

3491
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:22,720
you'll watch today and you'll still 
laugh your ass off.

3492
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:27,940
Stuff of him going back to Africa,
stuff of him shooting his car because 

3493
02:41:27,940 --> 02:41:29,330
his girlfriend's trying to leave.
So he shot the car.

3494
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:32,900
Like he's got some,
some bits that are still to this day,

3495
02:41:32,930 --> 02:41:34,190
like,
and you know,

3496
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:36,770
he massively influenced Eddie Murphy.

3497
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:41,210
Massively influenced Chris rock who was 
influenced by Eddie Murphy.

3498
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:42,570
You know what I mean?
He,

3499
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:45,710
I think he's the cornerstone.
I think he's the big cornerstone.

3500
02:41:45,711 --> 02:41:47,990
Stand up.
I'm happy to say I feel the same way.

3501
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:50,990
I thought that you will go to.
I liked George Karl.

3502
02:41:51,190 --> 02:41:53,110
I think George Carlin's,
I'm sure,

3503
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:55,340
but he wasn't my Richard Pryor.
Richard Pryor,

3504
02:41:55,341 --> 02:41:56,410
right?
My fucking belt.

3505
02:41:56,420 --> 02:42:01,420
I love for me.
For me it was prior and then it was 

3506
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:01,420
Kennison after prior.
Like Kenneth,

3507
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:03,440
I think kinison for a couple of years 
was just a monster monster.

3508
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:04,420
Now they be,
oh,

3509
02:42:04,550 --> 02:42:07,120
special.
The lighter.

3510
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:09,120
What's the name of that lie from?
Hell?

3511
02:42:09,650 --> 02:42:12,490
That's louder than hell.
Fucking tremendous.

3512
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:13,180
I mean,
listen,

3513
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:15,530
the Isis first special.
Oh yeah.

3514
02:42:15,590 --> 02:42:17,870
It's a fucking thing.
There's some specials for the.

3515
02:42:17,871 --> 02:42:22,871
Just they hold it.
I used to watch when I used to go to 

3516
02:42:22,871 --> 02:42:26,261
that for they used to be a movie rental 
place on Twenty Eighth Street in 

3517
02:42:26,331 --> 02:42:26,750
Boulder.

3518
02:42:26,750 --> 02:42:31,750
It was three floors.
It was the biggest video store on the 

3519
02:42:31,750 --> 02:42:33,470
west coast 20 years ago.
They had everything I rented that Rodney

3520
02:42:33,471 --> 02:42:35,060
special from them so much.
And it.

3521
02:42:35,061 --> 02:42:38,900
What else?
I rented the best bet for Joe Torry.

3522
02:42:39,250 --> 02:42:40,140
Joe,
sorry.

3523
02:42:40,220 --> 02:42:42,740
Joe.
Tory was the warmup then before,

3524
02:42:45,860 --> 02:42:47,220
but when he had.
No,

3525
02:42:47,270 --> 02:42:48,800
no,
because in those days.

3526
02:42:49,190 --> 02:42:51,050
Yeah.
What's his name was the host of the show

3527
02:42:51,051 --> 02:42:53,600
for def jam before he,
who was the host of def jam,

3528
02:42:54,110 --> 02:42:59,110
um,
who's smart and for awhile already did 

3529
02:42:59,110 --> 02:42:59,830
it.
They used to have jumped toi.

3530
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:03,410
Was Jack back then remember that he 
would do like sleeveless shirts.

3531
02:43:03,411 --> 02:43:07,520
You'd have giant ass fucking arms.
He was in that mood with Janet Jackson.

3532
02:43:07,700 --> 02:43:12,700
Yes.
That's when he was young with Tupac and 

3533
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:12,700
fuck in

3534
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:17,000
uh,
the Janet Jackson is Mexican boyfriend 

3535
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:17,000
CV.
Yeah.

3536
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:20,970
Some pictures of video of Joe Torry host
in Def Jam.

3537
02:43:21,690 --> 02:43:23,920
Like with,
he would wear a sleeveless shirts,

3538
02:43:24,130 --> 02:43:26,410
like nobody ever dressed like that.
And he was funny.

3539
02:43:26,411 --> 02:43:28,100
He was funny bro.
I liked that one.

3540
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:33,120
He has that guy been.
I just flew with him a couple of weeks 

3541
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:34,960
ago where he still lives here.
He has his house in St Louis.

3542
02:43:35,740 --> 02:43:40,740
He's got a house.
He's raising this kid and guy torry 

3543
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:43,770
started that fat Tuesday's right.
That was the thing that was at the 

3544
02:43:43,770 --> 02:43:43,770
comedy store.
Fucking great guys.

3545
02:43:43,770 --> 02:43:45,280
But he's fucking amazing.
There's Joe.

3546
02:43:46,650 --> 02:43:50,970
See if you can find a picture of him 
right down there.

3547
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,800
Nothing really popped.
It doesn't show anything.

3548
02:43:53,830 --> 02:43:58,830
Did he?
Was Jack Jack like unusually Jack for 

3549
02:43:58,830 --> 02:44:03,151
comedians.
It doesn't show him on stage with like 

3550
02:44:03,151 --> 02:44:03,610
sleeveless shirts and shit.
Well that's Martin Lawrence.

3551
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:08,560
Martin Lawrence banned.
That guy was my nemesis.

3552
02:44:08,590 --> 02:44:09,790
Not,
not in a bad sense,

3553
02:44:09,791 --> 02:44:12,790
but in that I would have to go on after 
him all the time the crime was started.

3554
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:17,820
Oh my God.
Mitzi shore put me on after him 50 

3555
02:44:18,221 --> 02:44:21,970
fucking times.
Those were some of the 50 hardest sets I

3556
02:44:21,971 --> 02:44:24,490
ever had,
like doing standup in the early days,

3557
02:44:24,830 --> 02:44:29,830
I would just fucking bomb.
Just like the Hindenburg just go down in

3558
02:44:32,501 --> 02:44:34,120
flames.
It's okay.

3559
02:44:34,121 --> 02:44:36,120
Jammer.
I never really saw him at the store.

3560
02:44:36,150 --> 02:44:37,360
Oh Man.
He was so good.

3561
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:39,640
I caught him,
but it was before your time.

3562
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:45,360
This was like when I first started,
so I was at the store when I first got 

3563
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:47,500
passed in [inaudible] 94,
so this was like around 94 95 before you

3564
02:44:47,501 --> 02:44:52,501
came along and he was on fire.
Martin Lawrence was on fire and he 

3565
02:44:52,930 --> 02:44:57,930
people forgot how God damn good he is 
because he went crazy and he had all 

3566
02:44:57,930 --> 02:44:58,710
those issues and you know,
he,

3567
02:44:58,770 --> 02:45:00,450
he's wearing a rubber suit and he had a 
gun.

3568
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:05,450
They got pulled over and he said he was 
dehydrated and it was on some sort of 

3569
02:45:05,450 --> 02:45:05,450
drugs and they locked him up in a psych 
ward.

3570
02:45:05,450 --> 02:45:07,160
Like there's a lot of nutty shit with 
him.

3571
02:45:07,161 --> 02:45:12,161
Right.
So people forgot how God damn good he 

3572
02:45:12,161 --> 02:45:12,400
was when he was in his prime.
But when he was in his prime,

3573
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:14,170
yeah,
there he is and bad boys.

3574
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:19,320
But that's not the price.
That's the stand up though was what was 

3575
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:23,731
up when I saw him at the comedy store 
and he would wear fucking like leather 

3576
02:45:23,731 --> 02:45:26,260
jumpsuits and shit and just rip that 
place apart.

3577
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:31,920
He was on fire and he was another one 
that had a bunch of jokes that people 

3578
02:45:33,171 --> 02:45:38,171
have decided were offensive when MTV was
getting upset at dice clay.

3579
02:45:39,650 --> 02:45:42,340
Remember when they banned dice clay for 
offensive material?

3580
02:45:42,341 --> 02:45:46,120
I believe he got caught up in a 
controversy about offensive material to.

3581
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:48,490
It's like the early days of political 
correctness.

3582
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:51,790
They decided to get pissed at certain 
jokes.

3583
02:45:53,950 --> 02:45:57,820
The other day I was driving.
I was thinking about news radio.

3584
02:45:57,980 --> 02:46:00,420
You're so crazy.
You motherfucking hide.

3585
02:46:01,490 --> 02:46:06,430
Not Horshack Epstein.
The play your brother Apollo.

3586
02:46:06,431 --> 02:46:08,800
I was just 16.
Nick Depaulo and Brian Cowen.

3587
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:11,480
Oh my God.
Where did you pull up?

3588
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:12,580
Epstein?
Well,

3589
02:46:12,590 --> 02:46:17,590
they hired Epstein,
but Nick Depalo and Brian Cowen I 

3590
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:17,590
brought in.
Okay.

3591
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:18,950
I thought High Epstein to.
Yeah.

3592
02:46:18,951 --> 02:46:19,460
No,
no,

3593
02:46:19,461 --> 02:46:19,760
no,
no,

3594
02:46:19,761 --> 02:46:20,090
no,
no,

3595
02:46:20,091 --> 02:46:20,570
no,
no,

3596
02:46:20,580 --> 02:46:25,580
I don't.
I didn't meet him until he was on the 

3597
02:46:25,580 --> 02:46:25,580
set.
He was a real nice guy though.

3598
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:27,740
Did he pass away?
Oh,

3599
02:46:27,790 --> 02:46:28,700
thanks.
Yeah.

3600
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:29,960
Yeah,
I check it.

3601
02:46:30,190 --> 02:46:32,960
I feel like was really fucking sick,
bro.

3602
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:38,320
Your buddy,
the one guy who introduced me to from 

3603
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:42,250
that baseball show you on the Spanish 
guy that was on there with your nice 

3604
02:46:42,381 --> 02:46:43,940
guy.
Spanish guy.

3605
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,590
Yeah.
You were on a baseball show?

3606
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:46,520
Yeah.
Well,

3607
02:46:46,521 --> 02:46:51,350
I'm thinking Mike Star.
Mike Star who uh,

3608
02:46:51,390 --> 02:46:54,350
the Spanish guy that came to visit at 
the store a few times.

3609
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:56,510
He's a guy.
Yeah.

3610
02:46:56,870 --> 02:47:01,870
I just donated to his gold.
There's a dude from star trek.

3611
02:47:03,110 --> 02:47:04,220
Remember that?
That dude,

3612
02:47:04,221 --> 02:47:08,000
it's in star trek all the time.
I'm fucking.

3613
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:10,040
What is his name?
God Damn it.

3614
02:47:11,330 --> 02:47:16,150
But he was the older pitcher and I was 
the young asshole ballplayer.

3615
02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:17,970
What was that?
Betty White?

3616
02:47:18,730 --> 02:47:19,940
Yeah.
She was not betty.

3617
02:47:19,941 --> 02:47:20,630
What was it?
Betty White?

3618
02:47:20,670 --> 02:47:22,220
No,
the other lady from,

3619
02:47:22,221 --> 02:47:24,200
uh,
what's the cast?

3620
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:26,990
Some.
God Damn it.

3621
02:47:27,230 --> 02:47:29,330
I don't remember her name.
See if you can find the cast.

3622
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:38,420
Yeah,
but you don't want images that you want 

3623
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:39,720
actual text.
Don't go to images.

3624
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:43,160
Sometimes it pops up.
Wow.

3625
02:47:43,180 --> 02:47:43,790
See?
Yeah.

3626
02:47:43,930 --> 02:47:44,850
Ben.
Rosemary.

3627
02:47:44,990 --> 02:47:46,190
Yeah.
Rosemarie.

3628
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:49,040
Ben Greenwood.
Mike Star.

3629
02:47:49,730 --> 02:47:50,900
Keep going.
Scrolling left.

3630
02:47:52,660 --> 02:47:53,590
Yeah.
Ben Greenwood.

3631
02:47:53,591 --> 02:47:55,600
He thought guys and star.
He's in a bunch of movies now.

3632
02:47:55,601 --> 02:47:59,440
Dan Flores.
He was in a law and order law and order,

3633
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:01,660
but go the other way that doing 
wentworth.

3634
02:48:01,720 --> 02:48:03,730
She's hilarious.
She's been in a bunch of shit.

3635
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:05,350
Chris Browning,
he was on.

3636
02:48:05,710 --> 02:48:07,780
He's been a bunch of signs attic.
He recently.

3637
02:48:08,310 --> 02:48:12,550
Was He Mike fucking weird man.
What year was that?

3638
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:14,900
What year is it?
Say it was four.

3639
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:15,970
Four,
four.

3640
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:20,980
That's when I had to move to California.
I was miserable.

3641
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:26,530
I was shooting this the first couple of 
weeks we'll get me.

3642
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:28,930
I was like 26.
There are so weird.

3643
02:48:29,410 --> 02:48:30,730
Um,
you know what,

3644
02:48:30,731 --> 02:48:31,690
man,
when,

3645
02:48:31,780 --> 02:48:35,560
when it first started out it was fun.
And then,

3646
02:48:35,561 --> 02:48:38,920
um,
what happened was with twitch TV shows,

3647
02:48:38,980 --> 02:48:43,980
a lot of times you have like these 
really funny writers and these guys who 

3648
02:48:43,980 --> 02:48:45,670
wrote it originally were really good,
but the,

3649
02:48:45,671 --> 02:48:50,671
uh,
they had written from married with 

3650
02:48:50,671 --> 02:48:52,111
children and the simpsons and the 
network had decided for some reason they

3651
02:48:53,321 --> 02:48:57,040
weren't strong enough to run the show 
and that they were only writers.

3652
02:48:57,070 --> 02:48:59,890
They weren't like a real show runner.
So they brought in.

3653
02:48:59,891 --> 02:49:04,891
This guy was a show runner.
He was terrible and I didn't get along 

3654
02:49:04,891 --> 02:49:08,160
with him at all and they were actually 
close to firing me or him

3655
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:13,280
like there was like a real impasse 
between the two of us because the guys 

3656
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:15,090
riding was dog shit.
I was crazy back then.

3657
02:49:15,091 --> 02:49:17,550
Did I didn't give a fuck.
I had zero filter.

3658
02:49:17,580 --> 02:49:19,590
I never thought I was going to be an 
actor in the first place.

3659
02:49:19,591 --> 02:49:24,591
I couldn't believe him on the set.
And so they would try to get me to do 

3660
02:49:24,591 --> 02:49:24,591
stuff and it'd be like,
what?

3661
02:49:24,591 --> 02:49:26,280
And they would like give me the script.
Like wow,

3662
02:49:26,281 --> 02:49:29,760
we made revisions to the script and I 
would read it goes this fucking terrible

3663
02:49:29,761 --> 02:49:31,680
and they would get pissed at me and 
people will be pissed.

3664
02:49:31,681 --> 02:49:34,620
I'm going to tell me how this is funny.
Explain to me how this is funny.

3665
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:36,820
And then you know,
like executives are going,

3666
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:38,790
you know,
you're talking to my agent,

3667
02:49:38,791 --> 02:49:39,530
this guy,
you know,

3668
02:49:39,610 --> 02:49:44,610
he's,
he's very arrogant and he's causing 

3669
02:49:44,610 --> 02:49:45,750
problems on the set and I'm like,
I'm not causing problems in the set.

3670
02:49:45,960 --> 02:49:47,340
I go,
they took the writer stuff,

3671
02:49:47,341 --> 02:49:49,380
they rewrote it and they turned it into 
dog shit,

3672
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:51,060
you show me,
show me how it's not,

3673
02:49:51,550 --> 02:49:56,550
and I was like very close to like 
killing my sitcom career completely just

3674
02:49:58,741 --> 02:50:01,620
by having no filter,
but then they realized it,

3675
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:04,470
they read it and then they came and 
watched some of the run throughs and the

3676
02:50:04,471 --> 02:50:06,390
network fired him,
but it was close.

3677
02:50:06,391 --> 02:50:09,900
He wanted me out,
but I was one of the stars of the show.

3678
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:13,410
It was me and Ben Greenwood Guy,
but.

3679
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:15,870
And then I mean it was a,
it was an ensemble show,

3680
02:50:15,871 --> 02:50:19,170
but I played the star player.
There was,

3681
02:50:19,171 --> 02:50:24,171
there was about a baseball team of 
fucked up baseball team and I was the 

3682
02:50:24,171 --> 02:50:27,770
guy who was always causing trouble and 
wrecking his car and going crazy and so 

3683
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:30,090
they were having a real problem with me,
but it was,

3684
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:33,510
it was because these guys that had 
originally wrote it,

3685
02:50:34,050 --> 02:50:35,310
these guys were genius.

3686
02:50:35,310 --> 02:50:40,310
They were really,
really funny and they took their words 

3687
02:50:40,310 --> 02:50:42,960
and just butchered it and turned into 
some hackneyed fucked up sitcoms,

3688
02:50:42,961 --> 02:50:44,460
which is what they usually do.
Well,

3689
02:50:44,461 --> 02:50:47,430
Jim Brewer was in the pilot with me,
Jim Brewer.

3690
02:50:47,460 --> 02:50:52,460
That was me look like a baby.
So weird.

3691
02:50:52,890 --> 02:50:55,440
Um,
so jim brewer was in the pilot with me.

3692
02:50:55,441 --> 02:50:58,350
He played the mascot for the team.
Fuck.

3693
02:50:58,351 --> 02:51:03,351
It was funny man.
And Jim and I were buddies from New 

3694
02:51:03,351 --> 02:51:04,180
York.
There's Jim that's Jim Breuer.

3695
02:51:05,830 --> 02:51:08,890
No,
Jim Breuer played the pioneer who uh,

3696
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:12,960
he had like the,
the bay I feel like,

3697
02:51:13,150 --> 02:51:18,150
like he got in a fight.
Jeff current and Kevin Martin back back 

3698
02:51:18,150 --> 02:51:22,701
that up right there where you see the 
lens of the screen where you see the 

3699
02:51:22,701 --> 02:51:24,290
words like right there.
Kevin Curran Rather.

3700
02:51:24,291 --> 02:51:26,340
And Jeff Martin,
sorry I fucked her.

3701
02:51:26,341 --> 02:51:28,570
Name's up Kevin Kern and Jeff Martin 
with the guys who,

3702
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:32,550
who wrote it and um,
they were really,

3703
02:51:32,551 --> 02:51:35,820
really nice guys and we really funny 
guys but they were writers,

3704
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:41,240
you know,
and this was something that they'd 

3705
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:41,240
created and then the network just 
butchered it.

3706
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:44,430
And then it wound up getting canceled 
and then I was ready to move back to New

3707
02:51:44,430 --> 02:51:45,160
York,
but I fucked up.

3708
02:51:45,161 --> 02:51:46,770
But I had already got a lease on an 
apartment.

3709
02:51:47,310 --> 02:51:49,740
I got an apartment on Moore Park and 
studio city,

3710
02:51:49,741 --> 02:51:52,350
or it was actually north Hollywood and I
was like,

3711
02:51:52,351 --> 02:51:53,940
fuck,
already got this apartment,

3712
02:51:53,970 --> 02:51:56,250
like what do I do?
And so I'm like,

3713
02:51:56,251 --> 02:52:01,251
God,
I got to stay here because I got a 

3714
02:52:01,251 --> 02:52:01,251
lease.
And I was like,

3715
02:52:01,251 --> 02:52:01,251
shit,
I want to move back to New York.

3716
02:52:01,251 --> 02:52:02,520
I hated it out here.
I hated dealing with actors.

3717
02:52:02,820 --> 02:52:05,630
I'd never been around actors and that 
thing that,

3718
02:52:05,631 --> 02:52:10,631
that we were talking about before where 
people just say things that they don't 

3719
02:52:10,631 --> 02:52:13,981
really mean because they think that 
you're supposed to say those things 

3720
02:52:13,981 --> 02:52:14,260
because there's like a pattern of 
behavior that you chose to.

3721
02:52:14,520 --> 02:52:16,660
Yeah,
I thought he was amazing in that film.

3722
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:19,300
It was excellent.
I thought he had a lot to offer.

3723
02:52:20,110 --> 02:52:25,110
I mean there was a lot of that kind of 
nonsense out here where I was used to 

3724
02:52:25,110 --> 02:52:25,830
real people.
I mean,

3725
02:52:26,410 --> 02:52:29,080
for sure I was a flawed person.
I mean for sure.

3726
02:52:29,081 --> 02:52:34,081
I was rough and I said I just wasn't,
didn't have good decorum.

3727
02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:37,450
Like the way I communicated,
I was a rough guy,

3728
02:52:37,870 --> 02:52:42,870
you know,
I'd come from fighting and then went 

3729
02:52:42,870 --> 02:52:44,170
right into standing up and this was only
a few years later I'm doing this now.

3730
02:52:44,171 --> 02:52:48,310
I had my last fight in 89,
so this is 94.

3731
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:52,300
I mean this is just a few years after 
that I was still very sketchy,

3732
02:52:53,220 --> 02:52:54,580
you know,
so I didn't belong.

3733
02:52:54,610 --> 02:52:57,010
I felt like I didn't belong there.
I felt like I couldn't be myself.

3734
02:52:57,011 --> 02:52:59,560
Everybody was like reading the Hollywood
reporter and variety,

3735
02:52:59,610 --> 02:53:02,770
unsettling the fuck you guys reading 
this shit for like,

3736
02:53:02,771 --> 02:53:03,430
it's like this.

3737
02:53:03,790 --> 02:53:08,790
It was just the whole thing to me was 
like this weird play that people were 

3738
02:53:08,790 --> 02:53:11,590
putting on where everybody was trying to
pretend to be something so that they can

3739
02:53:11,591 --> 02:53:16,591
get auditions.
And I remember going on some auditions 

3740
02:53:16,591 --> 02:53:19,441
and dealing with some of those people,
casting agents that had all this power 

3741
02:53:19,441 --> 02:53:24,031
over you and they,
they exhibited it like they exerted it 

3742
02:53:24,031 --> 02:53:27,840
when you were in the room with them.
They didn't communicate with you like 

3743
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:30,340
you're a person and I'm a person.
They communicated with you like you want

3744
02:53:30,341 --> 02:53:32,290
something from me and I don't know if 
I'm going to give it to you.

3745
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:33,790
Hmm.
Let me see what you do.

3746
02:53:34,020 --> 02:53:36,430
It was just the way they did.
It was just so shitty.

3747
02:53:37,150 --> 02:53:38,920
It was just.
It was gross.

3748
02:53:39,490 --> 02:53:40,830
It was just.
It was fun.

3749
02:53:41,050 --> 02:53:41,800
Oh,
it's gross.

3750
02:53:41,890 --> 02:53:44,320
I mean this is.
This is the thing that people have.

3751
02:53:44,590 --> 02:53:45,850
The real problem that people have with 
this.

3752
02:53:45,860 --> 02:53:50,860
However Harvey Weinstein situation is 
not just that the fact that he was a 

3753
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:56,040
piece of shit to all these women,
it's his position of power that he had 

3754
02:53:56,040 --> 02:53:59,641
over them that he exerted.
He got himself into this position and 

3755
02:53:59,641 --> 02:54:00,700
then use that position to on some.
I mean,

3756
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:04,240
according to Whitney Whitney.
Cummings was talking to me about this.

3757
02:54:04,241 --> 02:54:09,241
She's like,
what you're hearing as all the women 

3758
02:54:09,241 --> 02:54:09,241
that said no to him.
She's like that guy.

3759
02:54:09,241 --> 02:54:09,970
Fuck,
fuck,

3760
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,980
fuck,
fuck the economy.

3761
02:54:11,981 --> 02:54:15,940
And it was part of the deals that he 
gave and they even went after one of the

3762
02:54:15,941 --> 02:54:20,941
girls.
He was fucking that girl from Donnie 

3763
02:54:20,941 --> 02:54:22,420
Brasco and she did the movie with the 
Gretchen Mol.

3764
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:23,680
Yeah,
she did.

3765
02:54:23,681 --> 02:54:24,820
Rounders,
oh,

3766
02:54:24,821 --> 02:54:29,050
I remember the blonde cute thing.
Now if you watched Donnie Brasco,

3767
02:54:29,051 --> 02:54:30,130
she,
Donnie Brasco,

3768
02:54:30,131 --> 02:54:31,450
she ain't got a fucking line to that.

3769
02:54:31,450 --> 02:54:33,370
More.
Not Aligned.

3770
02:54:33,590 --> 02:54:35,860
Willing.
She's an extra in that movie.

3771
02:54:35,861 --> 02:54:40,861
Basically Sonny black girlfriend,
but when you see her in fucking 

3772
02:54:40,861 --> 02:54:44,461
whatever,
she's got a bunch of lines now and it 

3773
02:54:44,461 --> 02:54:46,771
was because she was fucking highway.
They just went after a couple of weeks 

3774
02:54:46,771 --> 02:54:46,771
ago.
Gretchen Maga who went and met,

3775
02:54:46,771 --> 02:54:48,180
who went after just,
you know,

3776
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:50,020
Angelina Jolie and the truth.
Oh,

3777
02:54:50,021 --> 02:54:52,540
they're all saying that this is the 
reason why dick suck suckers.

3778
02:54:52,660 --> 02:54:55,180
Listen,
they all got to suck it up virtually.

3779
02:54:56,220 --> 02:54:58,180
Look,
I had heard that there was a lot of them

3780
02:54:58,181 --> 02:55:00,550
that were actually very successful that 
fucked him.

3781
02:55:01,210 --> 02:55:03,100
I mean this was this,
this guy's thing.

3782
02:55:03,650 --> 02:55:04,550
It's,
it's Kinda,

3783
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:06,860
it's.
I mean it's fucked up and it's dark.

3784
02:55:06,861 --> 02:55:11,270
But once that gets going and once that's
what he does,

3785
02:55:11,570 --> 02:55:14,060
how do you stop that train?
Other than what they did,

3786
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:19,150
they all knew.
They all knew and nobody opened their 

3787
02:55:19,150 --> 02:55:19,150
fucking mouth.

3788
02:55:19,150 --> 02:55:19,930
So you could suck my dick.
A couple of them opened them out.

3789
02:55:20,030 --> 02:55:25,030
A couple of them get,
they got swept under the carpet and 

3790
02:55:25,030 --> 02:55:25,220
that's always gonna happen,
but I rather fucking,

3791
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:30,240
you know,
the rest of these like Angelica and the 

3792
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:30,240
rest of these people.
Listen,

3793
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:31,790
I'm over brother.
I don't want to hear this shit no more.

3794
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:32,360
It's,
it's,

3795
02:55:32,390 --> 02:55:36,050
it's amazing,
like just the bullshit that these people

3796
02:55:36,051 --> 02:55:41,051
create in their worlds and you're right,
when you go to these casting things and 

3797
02:55:41,051 --> 02:55:43,910
you see these things,
you see the fucking bullshit at out of a

3798
02:55:43,911 --> 02:55:44,720
man.
Well,

3799
02:55:44,721 --> 02:55:47,930
it's one of the reasons why people in 
this town are so crazy.

3800
02:55:47,931 --> 02:55:49,670
It's because their insecurity to begin 
with,

3801
02:55:49,671 --> 02:55:54,671
right?
The only reason why anybody becomes an 

3802
02:55:54,671 --> 02:55:54,671
actor,
like why,

3803
02:55:54,671 --> 02:55:56,270
why people want to be famous,
not the only reason,

3804
02:55:56,271 --> 02:56:01,271
but one of the main reasons why people 
want to be famous is because at some 

3805
02:56:01,271 --> 02:56:02,390
point in their life they didn't feel 
valuable.

3806
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:04,850
At some point in their life,
they felt discarded.

3807
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:09,880
They felt abused,
they felt ignored and they had this 

3808
02:56:10,370 --> 02:56:13,010
inescapable need for attention.
This,

3809
02:56:13,070 --> 02:56:18,070
this whole that cannot be filled,
and that was the driving force that led 

3810
02:56:18,411 --> 02:56:23,411
them into acting.
Where would they could be on that stage 

3811
02:56:23,411 --> 02:56:26,141
and everyone was looking at them all 
eyes on them while the microphone was on

3812
02:56:26,811 --> 02:56:31,811
and the words were coming out of their 
mouth and they were in the play or in 

3813
02:56:31,811 --> 02:56:35,111
the movie or doing stand up even.
It's a lot of the same stuff that 

3814
02:56:35,111 --> 02:56:36,590
propelled you and I being ignored as a 
child,

3815
02:56:36,620 --> 02:56:38,990
you know,
like p feeling like you were nothing.

3816
02:56:39,350 --> 02:56:41,960
And then realizing that when you're on 
stage man,

3817
02:56:41,961 --> 02:56:45,320
then your something like that person up 
there with a spotlight on them,

3818
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:50,500
that person's shining.
That's a something person that's not a 

3819
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:54,851
zero,
but that thing that leads you to become 

3820
02:56:54,851 --> 02:56:59,500
an actor want to become famous is also 
like it's,

3821
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:04,660
it's so fucked up with acting because 
you have to get chosen.

3822
02:57:05,150 --> 02:57:09,070
It's not like music or like stand up 
where you can look at,

3823
02:57:09,080 --> 02:57:14,080
stand up.
All you have to do as you do open mic 

3824
02:57:14,080 --> 02:57:14,080
nights,
you get funny,

3825
02:57:14,080 --> 02:57:14,340
you build up an act in and people come 
to see you.

3826
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:17,180
You build up a career and the next thing
you know you,

3827
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:19,670
you become a successful comedian.
That's what happened to you.

3828
02:57:19,790 --> 02:57:21,620
That's what happened to me,
but with acting,

3829
02:57:21,621 --> 02:57:23,340
you have to get chosen.
You don't.

3830
02:57:23,430 --> 02:57:25,880
You don't have to work like if you do 
plays,

3831
02:57:25,881 --> 02:57:27,530
nobody is ever going to fucking see you 
ever.

3832
02:57:27,620 --> 02:57:32,620
You're never gonna make it out of place.
Nobody's going to see famous play 

3833
02:57:32,620 --> 02:57:33,290
actors.
Nobody gives a shit about them.

3834
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:35,900
You have to be in movies,
you have to be in television,

3835
02:57:35,901 --> 02:57:40,901
so you have to get chosen,
so you have this whole chain of like 

3836
02:57:40,901 --> 02:57:41,510
June,
maybe I'll pick you,

3837
02:57:41,540 --> 02:57:46,540
but I'm not sure are you the one?
And so you have to develop this sort of 

3838
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:48,830
personality that fits in with their what
they're looking for.

3839
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:52,070
You have to mold your sensibilities and 
your ideas.

3840
02:57:52,220 --> 02:57:57,220
Like there's a lot of people that are in
Hollywood that don't have opinions of 

3841
02:57:57,220 --> 02:58:01,871
their own.
What they have is a series of opinions 

3842
02:58:01,871 --> 02:58:01,980
that they've adopted,
adapted

3843
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:05,100
because they think it's going to lead 
them to be successful.

3844
02:58:05,580 --> 02:58:10,580
Have they heard of star?
But you know how many times I go to an 

3845
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:10,580
audition,
I hear this like my.

3846
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:12,150
This is my.
A lot of people don't like to audition.

3847
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:18,080
I like to audition and I'll tell you why
because I fuck with them because you're 

3848
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:18,080
funny.
You know,

3849
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:18,510
I ripped my pants,
you know,

3850
02:58:18,690 --> 02:58:19,790
if you watch,
uh,

3851
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:23,040
uh,
what's that show on CBS?

3852
02:58:23,041 --> 02:58:28,041
That's been forever.
Don't fudge one Monday night's Big Bang 

3853
02:58:28,351 --> 02:58:29,550
theory.
The one before that.

3854
02:58:29,620 --> 02:58:32,460
How I met your mother.
I didn't know how I met your mother.

3855
02:58:32,810 --> 02:58:33,990
I didn't even know you did it.
Yeah.

3856
02:58:33,991 --> 02:58:35,340
If you watch the episode,
you're like,

3857
02:58:35,341 --> 02:58:36,210
Joey,
you're an extra.

3858
02:58:36,780 --> 02:58:38,760
I'm an extra.
You know why?

3859
02:58:38,761 --> 02:58:43,761
Because I want them to the audition.
I had no underwear on and there was 

3860
02:58:43,761 --> 02:58:47,281
this.
You see these things that pop out of 

3861
02:58:47,281 --> 02:58:47,281
chairs.

3862
02:58:47,281 --> 02:58:48,030
Yeah.
Side things are missed and she goes,

3863
02:58:48,031 --> 02:58:48,990
get up to read.
When I,

3864
02:58:49,050 --> 02:58:54,050
when I got up to read the fucking thing,
you got caught in the hole in my pants 

3865
02:58:54,050 --> 02:58:56,990
and my dick came out.
All three women sat down and I go to use

3866
02:58:57,060 --> 02:58:59,460
the egg roll and then I lost them for 
sure.

3867
02:58:59,970 --> 02:59:01,800
They even told me they go,
you got the job.

3868
02:59:02,250 --> 02:59:05,100
As I was walking down the street on Fox,
my phone rang,

3869
02:59:05,101 --> 02:59:06,030
my angel goes,
go back.

3870
02:59:06,031 --> 02:59:09,470
You didn't even read.
I didn't even read it.

3871
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:10,680
They had called.
My agent said,

3872
02:59:10,681 --> 02:59:15,681
we love this guy.
I went back and they saw the Cuban.

3873
02:59:16,631 --> 02:59:17,350
They grow,
you know,

3874
02:59:17,970 --> 02:59:20,760
probably not used to someone with 
confidence that didn't give a fuck.

3875
02:59:20,780 --> 02:59:22,650
You know,
I went to an audition one time,

3876
02:59:22,651 --> 02:59:25,530
Bro,
where the guy had never forget this.

3877
02:59:25,531 --> 02:59:29,040
The guy was a white trash guy,
like this family moved in,

3878
02:59:29,041 --> 02:59:34,041
there was a pilot for ABC and this guy 
is one of those guys that he had a 

3879
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:38,850
little circular pool in front of his 
house and he was,

3880
02:59:38,990 --> 02:59:43,990
he was watering shit,
but at the same time he had like a thug 

3881
02:59:43,990 --> 02:59:44,970
and he's fat,
he's got jewelry.

3882
02:59:44,970 --> 02:59:45,450
I'm like,
well,

3883
02:59:45,460 --> 02:59:47,430
those guys are like long island.
You know what I'm saying?

3884
02:59:47,960 --> 02:59:49,920
So I'll never forget.
I get to the audition.

3885
02:59:49,921 --> 02:59:51,510
All these guys are there.
Tony Lago.

3886
02:59:51,511 --> 02:59:53,790
God rest his soul.
He's Big Italian dudes.

3887
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:56,400
And I knew they were going to get the 
park bro.

3888
02:59:56,550 --> 02:59:57,780
I'm like,
they're going to get the part.

3889
02:59:57,781 --> 02:59:59,740
I'm not going to get it.
But I had warm up on it.

3890
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:05,840
Alright.
I a warm up sign with the string and I 

3891
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:07,971
had white tidy whities and that zip up 
jacket and I had a way three 80.

3892
03:00:09,720 --> 03:00:10,680
So I walked in,
I go,

3893
03:00:10,681 --> 03:00:12,480
I know what I'm going do.
I'm to take my pants off,

3894
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:19,760
I'm taking my walk in.
And what do you think these two ladies 

3895
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:21,240
say to me?
I hold on one second,

3896
03:00:21,241 --> 03:00:24,060
we'll be with you in a minute.
So they turn around.

3897
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:26,160
That's my cue,
bitch.

3898
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:31,700
I took those sweat pants off.
I took the shoes off and my socks and I 

3899
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:35,250
walked closer and I took my shirt off.
When they turned back around,

3900
03:00:35,310 --> 03:00:39,870
all I had was boxer shorts on like the 
tidy whities that's it.

3901
03:00:39,930 --> 03:00:42,940
Tits hanging out,
stomach hanging over the underwear.

3902
03:00:43,550 --> 03:00:45,840
And then as soon as they turn it around 
and they're like,

3903
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:48,540
oh my God,
that is terrible.

3904
03:00:50,340 --> 03:00:51,660
I'm like,
I'm not putting on shit.

3905
03:00:51,760 --> 03:00:53,280
Right.
I'm reading this motherfucker.

3906
03:00:54,450 --> 03:00:57,210
So you were supposed to like wave and 
say good morning.

3907
03:00:57,570 --> 03:00:59,010
And they're like,
action.

3908
03:00:59,290 --> 03:00:59,960
I love it.
And they like

3909
03:01:00,070 --> 03:01:02,540
can't even look at me because I'm 
completely making it,

3910
03:01:02,850 --> 03:01:07,850
you know?
And they can't even look at me that I'm 

3911
03:01:07,850 --> 03:01:07,920
making believe I'm flipping burgers and 
like look over at him.

3912
03:01:07,930 --> 03:01:12,310
I go live in like a doctor.
They booked me.

3913
03:01:12,890 --> 03:01:16,720
When I got to the audition,
that was the read live in like a doctor.

3914
03:01:16,721 --> 03:01:20,040
They even gave my own line.
Those dishes I wanted to.

3915
03:01:20,470 --> 03:01:22,660
They gave you whatever line I said in 
the audition,

3916
03:01:23,240 --> 03:01:24,880
like whatever they said wasn't good 
enough.

3917
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:29,460
I go in there with my own fucking line.
Yeah,

3918
03:01:29,470 --> 03:01:31,990
that's,
that's probably why you got it.

3919
03:01:32,130 --> 03:01:32,810
Look,
look,

3920
03:01:32,830 --> 03:01:37,830
look and show where he's just sitting.
That's when you were in those big daddy 

3921
03:01:37,830 --> 03:01:37,990
shirts.
Look how big I was.

3922
03:01:38,020 --> 03:01:40,060
Jesus Christ.
You were enormous back then.

3923
03:01:40,740 --> 03:01:41,800
Must have been like,
what?

3924
03:01:41,801 --> 03:01:42,870
Two thousand nine,
right?

3925
03:01:42,871 --> 03:01:44,440
Yeah.
This is 2000,

3926
03:01:44,470 --> 03:01:49,470
2002 when I met you,
like right after my chair brought you 

3927
03:01:49,470 --> 03:01:51,940
onto the set of news radio and they were
all like,

3928
03:01:52,570 --> 03:01:57,570
whoa.
Who is this guy with the leather jacket 

3929
03:01:57,570 --> 03:01:57,570
on?
Because this guy,

3930
03:01:57,570 --> 03:02:00,691
your friend like Joey,
they didn't know by the way that's 

3931
03:02:03,950 --> 03:02:06,430
looking at the red comes out of your.
But by the way,

3932
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:08,350
every time you call me,
that's what comes up.

3933
03:02:08,351 --> 03:02:09,760
I call me right now.
Call me

3934
03:02:13,630 --> 03:02:14,190
watches.

3935
03:02:15,100 --> 03:02:20,100
Hilarious.
That's us in the pool in Austin,

3936
03:02:22,111 --> 03:02:24,090
Texas.
