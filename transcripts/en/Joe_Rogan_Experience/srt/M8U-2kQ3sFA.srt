1
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,323
Okay.

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:13,680
Oh,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,420
exciting platform.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,730
So I'll dress for the weather,

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,110
getting degrees in La 15 and Columbus.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,470
We've got a very special guest
in the studio this morning.

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,131
Joe Rogan.

8
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,641
What's up?

9
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:28,641
Joe Just showed these people,

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,710
these lovely people.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,851
One guy.

12
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:34,684
One Cop.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,950
The worst.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,250
Yeah,

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,820
one of the worst that I've ever
seen in my whole entire life.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,690
Yeah.

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,180
Oh

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,161
yeah.

19
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:53,230
I'm doing stand up,

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,010
uh,

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,280
at the funny bone tonight and at
the southern theater tomorrow night.

22
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,460
The southern theater tomorrow night I'm
actually filming a comedy special for a

23
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,294
spike TV.

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,290
Okay.

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:06,551
All right.

26
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:07,600
You guys ready for the headliner?

27
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:09,791
Fuck yeah.

28
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:10,241
You might know.

29
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:12,020
Has got from news radio
off beer back there.

30
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,340
He's head because one hour
is bachelor for Spike TV.

31
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:14,980
Tomorrow night.

32
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,840
Just dug a theater.

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,800
Please get off meds or Joe Rogan.

34
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:18,634
I me mine.

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,210
Right.

36
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:22,571
Yo,

37
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:23,201
what's up?

38
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:23,481
What's up?

39
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:24,314
Columbus?

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,370
The fuck is going on my friends.

41
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,020
So I'm very excited to
be here in Columbus.

42
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,790
I'm doing a spike TV
special tomorrow night.

43
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,710
So it was nice to have that
warm upset in just loosen up,

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,850
get all the kinks out,

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,580
get rid of all the nerves
and just the next day.

46
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:41,190
I just felt

47
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,023
fantastic.

48
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,943
That's true.

49
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:51,950
Yeah,

50
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,080
but like what is he holding?

51
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:53,441
He's holding.

52
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,680
I don't make a bell.

53
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,400
Said Hey.

54
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,250
Right back up.

55
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,084
Work.

56
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,551
You broke.

57
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,050
It just stopped working.

58
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,930
This toilet is too low for me.

59
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,000
Every time I go to wipe I hit the water.

60
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,150
I feel like Jack Lab and stick.

61
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,540
Mike,

62
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,720
you could go up back again.

63
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,623
One more time.

64
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:48,631
Hold on,

65
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:48,901
hold on,

66
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:49,650
hold on.

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,430
Hey,

68
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:50,641
can we,

69
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,530
can we speak English?

70
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,830
Are you going to go around?

71
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,453
We got to be one.

72
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,620
A real path again,

73
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,190
so this is a perfect way to stop.

74
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,790
Stop here and you're in the right spot.

75
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,250
Yeah.

76
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,083
Okay.

77
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,923
Get

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,610
Hollywood exposed.

79
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,390
No,

80
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,830
just had to tell Joe that we
enter the car three times.

81
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:15,871
Bruce Lee,

82
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:16,704
Jackie with a guy,

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,810
he's going to fall and he's going to
stay with you so we have to drive around

84
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,490
again.

85
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,570
It's going to start with you.

86
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,110
One person.

87
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:02,930
Joy.

88
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,040
What happened on the plane?

89
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,600
There was like a cop or something.

90
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,790
I wasn't no

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
little cub.

92
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,943
It was

93
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,400
chill was twisting.

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,290
I took the thing out.

95
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,771
I took the thing.

96
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,160
The first class did a little fish.

97
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,640
Mine was twisted,

98
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,950
so she put the meal down.

99
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,110
So he's 12 and his little buddy,

100
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,831
oh my God,

101
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,520
did you see?

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,821
And I go,

103
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:26,654
excuse me,

104
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,853
excuse me,

105
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,761
excuse me.

106
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,420
Nancy's going back to squish the party.

107
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm like,

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,270
excuse me?

109
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,390
And the guy heard Joe joke,

110
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,170
it's like large county can get cute.

111
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:36,801
And I go,

112
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:37,281
excuse me.

113
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,720
I finally just push the fucking thing.

114
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,270
Push the fucking thing off.

115
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,010
It's Bush and the Goddamn
meal you're trading.

116
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,950
That was the end of that show.

117
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:43,784
I ate my meal.

118
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,720
It was eating a meal.

119
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,930
Nerman to have a too.

120
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,260
So she goes up closer to the back of
stretch to bring them back to things from

121
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:51,770
the bank,

122
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,603
taking them up.

123
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,680
She picks up my track out a peaker Tracy.

124
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,370
It was a weed and my ball sack though.

125
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,830
Fucking you kicking me,

126
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,190
right?

127
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,630
I could smell his kicking.

128
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,520
The breadth tab is going off.

129
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,080
I ate two cookies.

130
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,610
I got to go to the bathroom.

131
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,600
I got a pip.

132
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,720
I come back at him and his buddy of

133
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,330
down just tonight.

134
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,470
Hope is there a problem?

135
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,390
What's your fucking problem?

136
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,290
Next time you bang,

137
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,124
it's going to be a prompt.

138
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,600
He went to get up and turn.

139
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:21,801
He got up,

140
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:22,640
I grabbed the stove.

141
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,740
I just pull them down here,

142
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,060
just looked at it with a little sandals.

143
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,141
He'd go,

144
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,610
he ran to the store this and he's like,

145
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:29,240
you know,

146
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,420
he hit the thing and I go,

147
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,551
no,

148
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,250
what's your fault?

149
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,100
Because you put the deal
there were actually,

150
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,740
excuse me,

151
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,760
you to fucking look at.

152
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,200
You know,

153
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
Yo Yo yo yo

154
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,090
everybody in Ed.

155
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,250
I got off the plane.

156
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,721
He goes,

157
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:48,721
Amy is that Fuck Police Street
concent took me to the one side,

158
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:51,140
the kid to the other side of this.

159
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,610
This was no alcohol.

160
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,660
It was not either.

161
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,920
See what I go see him.

162
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,251
She goes,

163
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,040
no.

164
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,110
Who was the one you want to do?

165
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,420
They put us both together.

166
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,180
I use my fucking attorney skills.

167
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,970
So the last thing we see in this open is
planet earth with you shooting towards

168
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:08,300
it.

169
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,290
And your logo sort of left in the air.

170
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,610
Sort of like a smoke contrail and the
title of the show is sitting over there.

171
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,600
I would say Joe Rogan comedy special
talking monkeys in space long before you

172
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:18,434
start.

173
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,530
Not too long if the bar is
taking over [inaudible] 15 yeah.

174
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,130
So rowdy.
