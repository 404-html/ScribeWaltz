1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,820
Mother was very young,
she was mentally ill and it was a period

2
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:16,821
of time when 30 years ago when people
didn't know the difference between she

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,020
it paranoid schizophrenia,
manic depression,

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,890
they didn't know how to treat it,
so she was kind of self medicating with

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,460
alcohol.
This bond that's supposed to happen

6
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,830
because it keeps going back to
relationships and bonding.

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,780
She wasn't really able to show up as a
mother and as I understand it,

8
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:41,781
your neurochemistry doesn't develop a
certain way as an infant and you need

9
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:48,480
kind of jolts,
so you're kind of being prepared to be a

10
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,640
love addict in that way,
and she was also,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,460
for me,
the original love junkie.

12
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:56,640
If you've looked at the book,
there's that line.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,700
My mother cried over all the men in her
life and so clearly there was a

14
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,770
depressive thing which has an effect on
kids.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600
Again,
laying the groundwork.

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,980
She wasn't really available,
so I'd be reading fairytales,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,630
which no doubt fed into romantic ideas
of love,

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,380
sacrifice,
yearning because you're yearning to have

19
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:20,010
the original attachment.
Then layer on top of that,

20
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,090
the father,
again,

21
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:23,400
they were both young.
It's not about blaming them and in fact,

22
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:28,401
that's been a big part of breaking out
of this cycle is it's not anyone's

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,670
responsibility except your own.
You're an adult at this point.

24
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:33,960
Let's go.
It's enough.

25
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,220
You're not going to get the parental
love.

26
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,500
That would've been ideal.
We already had a mentally ill mother,

27
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:41,910
which has its own,
a drama in the house.

28
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,630
And there was always chaos and drama.
And uh,

29
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,770
her choices kept getting worse.
And men,

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,670
her next choice for her husband was
someone who was very violent,

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,450
who had named himself to get out of
going to Vietnam.

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,990
He was a alcoholic,
a very abusive controlling.

33
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,900
So he ran out.
And I'm glad my mother had enough

34
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,860
presence of mind to take me.
And we were off to New York and left

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,050
that.
And she was seven months pregnant at the

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,950
times.
Very.

37
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,890
Yeah.
So interestingly,

38
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,350
that,
that aspect of the Dickensian,

39
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:21,351
just these overblown incidents,
which I didn't really think of that way

40
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:25,200
when I was growing up because you can't,
that's the confusing thing too.

41
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,930
You get so into your survivor mode and
gallows humor.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,690
Um,
but the truth is now when I look back

43
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,390
and this memoir was a hugely informative
for this,

44
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,080
I realized that that was one of the
spots like there what ad words worth

45
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:45,540
call it spots in time,
that kind of flashpoints where I

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,750
experienced a fusion of fear and
pleasure.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,710
And that I think that violent experience
in the abuse there really had something

48
00:02:56,371 --> 00:03:01,371
to do with informing some of my choices
with ex cons and various other unsavory

49
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,420
but exciting seeming smart,
charming,

50
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,310
but dangerous men.
Later on.
