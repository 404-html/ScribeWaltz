1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930
I believe it.
Yeah,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:02,930
that's better.
All right.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,601
Five,
four,

4
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:04,434
three,
two

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,470
kapow and we're live.
Shirley,

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,080
how are ya?
I'm feeling alive.

7
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,510
You look alive.
Thanks.

8
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:15,470
So to you.
Does anybody ever asks you,

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,750
are you really only happy when it rains
all the time?

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,400
Is that annoying?
Yeah,

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,320
I would imagine so.
I shouldn't have done it.

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,900
Couldn't help myself.
It was a little beneath you,

13
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,670
but that's okay.
I'll forgive you.

14
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,690
I panicked.
I never do.

15
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,950
Well,
at least you didn't ask me.

16
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:31,930
Are you really?
Really?

17
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,820
Are you really?
You know the sister of Marla Munson is

18
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:37,280
another one too.
Oh is that one that comes up that comes

19
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:37,760
up alone?
Yeah.

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,700
That guy's a freak.
I met him.

21
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,390
I love him.
He's an odd dude.

22
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,880
He's,
you think,

23
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,210
oh,
I was kind of shocked by how normal he

24
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:48,320
is.
Very smart.

25
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,090
Very nice.
Smart and really,

26
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,890
I thought really forthright.
Yeah.

27
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,140
Oh yeah.
You say to them,

28
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,690
I love them.

29
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,710
Actually I,
I was,

30
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,180
I was crazy about him.
Well,

31
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,920
doesn't that in and of itself make him a
freak?

32
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,300
Yeah.
I guess in this world.

33
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,490
I mean,
we were just talking out there about how

34
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:05,480
many people are pilled up and that this
was while we were also talking about

35
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:08,540
people who can't tell the truth that
maybe even more weird.

36
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,180
Yeah.
We're,

37
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,920
we're talking about Trans Racial people.
You know,

38
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,350
the one folks,
we don't have to say her name,

39
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,150
you know that check for approval.
The one who thinks he's in and then that

40
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,520
dude who also did it,
it was a lot of weird people out there.

41
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,391
Yeah.
But uh,

42
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:25,340
also Jamie,
Jamie lies about being an Indian,

43
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,190
apparently not alive.
It's not a lie.

44
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,970
It's a joke.
It's not funny thing you can't,

45
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,750
Indian is actually kind of offensive to
some people now.

46
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,850
Yeah.
Where it was like standard for a long

47
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:38,360
time.

48
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,530
Well,
I'm ashamed to see you.

49
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:42,140
When I first came to America 20 years
ago,

50
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,190
I always cause it was the way we were
brought up to do.

51
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,990
We refer to native Americans as a Red
Indians.

52
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,050
We time I would see red,
Indian,

53
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,300
everybody in me,
my band would be gone.

54
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,450
You can't see that.
Stop that.

55
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,380
And I'm like,
Oh God,

56
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:58,370
I'm so sorry.
But you know,

57
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:01,280
I was 30 years in or whatever.
I was so used to seeing it.

58
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,730
The hose that a Scotland thing,
you say you this thing you say Red

59
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,440
Indian,
we used to see right Indian that has no

60
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:09,410
been completely changed.
But back then 20 odd years ago.

61
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,460
Yeah.
We always refer to native Americans as

62
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,370
Red Indian.
Yeah.

63
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,070
This,
I mean you can't say read people,

64
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,040
but you can say white people.
You can definitely say black people,

65
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,360
but you can't say yellow people.

66
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,100
Yeah,
it's complicated.

67
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,570
Yeah.
Two bills are complicated.

68
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,810
I get it.
You know,

69
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,710
if you did know,
it would be so like if you were just

70
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,800
learning this language,
like if you came from China or something

71
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:30,950
like that,
you can fees.

72
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,140
You'd be baffled.
Yes.

73
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,070
Yeah.
I spend my life baffled though.

74
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,330
That's okay.
I've just gone.

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,300
I just go with it.
No,

76
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
it's good for you to be baffled.
Good for you.

77
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,580
That is a good way to approach it.
Made me happier.

78
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,570
I'll tell you that.
It's definitely happy than trying to

79
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:47,750
control everything and a lot of people
that go down that rabbit hole,

80
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,280
that's not a good rabbit hole to go
down.

81
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,650
No,
but I think controlling things or it's

82
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:52,700
fear driven,
right?

83
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,581
Sure.
Yeah.

84
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:53,961
Yeah,
yeah,

85
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:54,860
definitely.
A lot of it.

86
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,980
I think I'm too old to be fearful
really,

87
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,150
but yeah.
Yeah,

88
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,030
but you are like a,
see there's a certain thing that happens

89
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,880
to people in show business when they get
to a certain age,

90
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,920
either they feel like it's slipping away
or they feel comfortable.

91
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,630
You seem like a comfortable person.
Yeah,

92
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:18,130
I'm a comfortable kind of kind of what's
uncomfortable?

93
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,790
I'm uncomfortable about a lot of,
let's get into it.

94
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,220
I'm sorry.
By lower your guard,

95
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:31,110
by giving you something really beneath
me first and then slip it in.

96
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,080
You don't even know it's coming.
No,

97
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,540
I'm uncomfortable about a lot of things,
but I hear what you're saying and yeah,

98
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,550
I feel like maybe if you feel like
you've failed and then you've stepped

99
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,850
back up,
then you start your,

100
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,190
you either crumble and you can't build
your life back up.

101
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Or you find a place to stand and you
build your career again on your own

102
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,070
terms and then it is comfortable.
Is that what you're saying?

103
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,160
Like that's where you're at.
That's what I'm saying.

104
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,740
But you never failed.
I felt I did.

105
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,770
Well,
you know,

106
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,980
we haven't,
we in the 90s where so much I sort of

107
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,910
pop cultural,
Zig aced I guess,

108
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,990
you know,
and that can't last forever.

109
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,370
But when it stops,
I should speak for myself.

110
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,390
When it stopped,
I was,

111
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,520
it was desi and from you,
I didn't really know what to do with

112
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:25,270
myself.
I didn't really understand my identity,

113
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,550
you know what I mean?
I didn't know who it was,

114
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,080
was such a ride because it was such a
crazy ride.

115
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,700
And I,
I densified with myself as a successful

116
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:37,270
person and my idea of success was really
warped,

117
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,000
you know?
So your idea of success was commercial

118
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,260
success,
correct?

119
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,470
Yeah.
Did you take any comfort in the artistic

120
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:47,440
success?
I did eventually,

121
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,730
but at the time I felt like we were
being creatively adventurous and we were

122
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,800
getting punished for it and it made me
really angry.

123
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,780
Um,
so you feel like you're getting the

124
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,180
published,
I mean,

125
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,730
was it the publishers though,
the music publishers that we're

126
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,230
punishing you?
Like what was,

127
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,820
it wasn't even that person,
although I took it personally,

128
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,030
it was really much more a cultural
shift,

129
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,700
you know?
So that just,

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,650
it wasn't received as well.
Correct?

131
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,730
You are correct.
So,

132
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,860
yeah.
And so we'd been used to being on top of

133
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,060
the charts,
you know,

134
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,010
and then when that stops,
all of a sudden you're like,

135
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,210
well,
is everything we're doing?

136
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:22,420
All our ideas are rubbish.
But deep down,

137
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,254
you know,
they're not,

138
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,770
but you're being rejected anyway.
And so you have to find a way through

139
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,150
that.
And that's complicated,

140
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,650
I think was complicated for a simple
girl like me that,

141
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,070
well I would imagine anytime you are as
big as garbage was in the nineties I

142
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,960
mean,
you guys weren't gigantic.

143
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,420
I mean,
it was hard to go into a clothing store

144
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:42,450
without hearing your music blaring.
Yeah.

145
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,720
And just mad.
Mad.

146
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,180
Yeah.
I'm a huge fan.

147
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:47,100
I love you.
God,

148
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,510
thank you.
So it's kind of weird sitting across

149
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:51,560
from me.
It is.

150
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,340
I'm enjoying you seem to be.
Yeah,

151
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,670
but I would imagine that like as big as
you guys were the either stay that big

152
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,720
and then you become a crazy person,
you probably better off like doing what

153
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:12,020
you did like,
like taking our artistic chances,

154
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,290
settling in and then doing what you're
doing now.

155
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,390
Being more comfortable.
Yeah,

156
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,960
I guess so.
I mean we were lucky we had a manager,

157
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,410
a very wise manager,
okay.

158
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,970
Ki Prime management at the time who
said,

159
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,610
what do you want?
Do you want a long career,

160
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,570
a lower level or do you want a short
career,

161
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,630
a ridiculously high level.
And we were like,

162
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:37,260
we want the long career and Stina that's
exactly what we got in the end.

163
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,590
But um,
there was this mad blip that happened

164
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:45,120
for alternative music,
which I had never gotten really that

165
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:49,440
much pop cultural success I guess.
We were like,

166
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:53,760
we'd enjoyed this weird rush of
alternative music that for far blip

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,100
ruled the charts.
If you weren't under old bands,

168
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,300
you were nothing bad.

169
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,720
Yeah.
You guys caught that wave,

170
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,760
that post Novo Nirvana.
Yeah.

171
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,320
Yeah.
That's really what it was.

172
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,400
Right?
Yeah.

173
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah.
I would love to talk to Chris Cornell

174
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,480
like when,
remember when Chris Cornell did those

175
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,160
pop music songs?
Like you went from soundgarden dislike

176
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,470
deep crazy dark band too.
Yeah,

177
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,810
that's true.
Like weird poppy music.

178
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,250
Some stuff softer and I'm sure he was
just trying to figure out a way to

179
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,790
survive like we all do.
Yeah.

180
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,570
And it's complicated for anybody.
Yeah.

181
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,250
With a career yourself included.
You know,

182
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:29,950
you have to like adopt and figured out
well,

183
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:30,880
okay,
where does stick?

184
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:31,010
Yeah.

185
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,480
To know.
Yeah.

186
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,380
It's weird.
Well,

187
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,620
I think ultimately what you got to
figure out is what are you like?

188
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,740
Yeah,
dude,

189
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,350
it's hard to know what you like
sometimes.

190
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,071
No,
sure.

191
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:43,850
Because if you don't like something but
it's super successful for you and you

192
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:45,800
might keep doing that.
That's very confusing.

193
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,260
Yeah.
Surely.

194
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,790
Goodness for getting here.
Yeah.

195
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,910
We're going to meet my future husband.
My wife's coming up here soon to keep

196
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:57,950
that on the DL.
I'm sure my husband will be listening

197
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,970
and laughing his ass.
Yeah.

198
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,930
Your husband is named Billy Bush
different Billy Bush not to grab the

199
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:03,740
pussy.
Billy Bush.

200
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,160
Correct.
But he,

201
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:07,410
he really suffered.
Sure.

202
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,630
Tell him he got like an hailstorm of
abuse via twitter.

203
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:12,650
I mean,
we find it funny,

204
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,360
but it was also quite alarming because
we were like,

205
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,040
oh my God,
I hope somebody isn't common.

206
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,200
Punish you.
What?

207
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,410
What's crazy is that guy,
the re the real grab the pussy.

208
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:23,930
Billy Bush didn't really do anything.
He was just there.

209
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,631
Yeah.
He,

210
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:26,990
he kind of was a scapegoat and then go
from there some,

211
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,210
I mean,
I think he was just trying to be

212
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
conciliatory as a TV host,
you know?

213
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:32,721
And he got,
yeah,

214
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,980
he got,
he lost his job.

215
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,880
No,
yes.

216
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,630
Yeah.
And he was sitting next to this gigantic

217
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,550
tycoon,
billionaire character,

218
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:43,220
this flamboyant,
boisterous,

219
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,490
sort of a guy who was going on his usual
flamboyant,

220
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,430
boisterous tyrese.
He probably felt like it was funny.

221
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,050
You know,
you're listening to this guy.

222
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,180
Did to be fair,

223
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,610
but yeah,
boy,

224
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:54,870
did he have to pay the price?

225
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,040
My husband too by default.
But it's funny that you know,

226
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:03,060
your husband would get hate from it,
the or that that guy would get hate

227
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,830
from.
People seem to be like looking for

228
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:07,680
people to get mad at all.
I think what all Matt,

229
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,260
right,
that the whole world is currently angry

230
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:13,770
and we don't really know why,
but we get fed a lot of negative

231
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:16,770
information and I don't know if the
human brain knows how to cook with it.

232
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,920
So it's very early on and the sort of
technological revolution,

233
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,860
so to speak.
And I don't think our brains have quite

234
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,310
caught up with how much bad news we're
absorbing on a daily basis.

235
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:26,971
And so I think,
yeah,

236
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:31,020
I think people are angry and upset and
they don't know what to do with it.

237
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,780
And there are certain figures that
attract that,

238
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,810
you know,
that kind of rage or wrath and the

239
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,890
people use these people as hot rods for
the on

240
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,850
chaos in their brains.

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,670
I think you just nailed it.
I think that's absolutely it.

242
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,290
We've been talking about it a bunch
lately,

243
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:53,010
that there's just too many people.
There's 7 billion people and to get all

244
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,890
the information,
especially the bad information from 7

245
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,880
billion people,
it's on marriage.

246
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,900
It's intense.
Yeah.

247
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:58,920
I mean,
yeah.

248
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,270
Well said.
It's just crazy.

249
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,630
You flicked through twitter or you
flicked through instagram or look on

250
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:06,510
facebook,
every single thing from every corner of

251
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:10,120
the globe is your heating bad news.
You know,

252
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,590
you want to hear because like if you
will,

253
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,560
the good news is not news.
No.

254
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,550
It's like everybody got along great
today.

255
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,100
Yeah.
But it's not a stories can sell that.

256
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,460
Yeah.
I'm just going to be really curious as

257
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:25,350
to see where the human race schools have
had high,

258
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,890
we do manage with all this information
cause even if you stand up for a cause

259
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:29,550
like,
you know,

260
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,610
like today I was,
I did a post about um,

261
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,110
for Amnesty International who's standing
up for the Turkish journalists who are,

262
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,360
who are all in prison for just doing
their jobs.

263
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,070
And so you stand up for that cause
because I feel very strongly in a free

264
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:48,870
press and you just become inundated with
people saying,

265
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,070
well,
what about Venezuela?

266
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:53,490
And they have their legitimate concerns
about what's going on in their country,

267
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:55,560
right by the women in Argentina,
you know,

268
00:10:55,561 --> 00:11:00,510
and so on and so forth.
And in Brazil and Mexico and I just

269
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:02,520
don't know even know what to do with all
the information.

270
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,790
There's a part of the problem too,
is that people expect you to comment on

271
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,920
every single thing.
And if you comment on one thing,

272
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,440
especially if you can't run a one funny,
silly thing,

273
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,221
they'll say,
well,

274
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:13,950
what about this?
Talking about this terrible things

275
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,170
happening.
It's almost like you have a

276
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:21,090
responsibility to alert people of your
state of consciousness that every step

277
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,140
of the day,
every second of the day,

278
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,910
I could,
I could definitely do that.

279
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,840
Not even I could do that just for the
emojis.

280
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:28,920
Yeah,
just as emojis.

281
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,800
I feel like emojis or the future,
I've been thinking a lot about this.

282
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,210
I think emojis,
I mean,

283
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,790
I think,
was it Eddie Brown with compared them to

284
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,740
hieroglyphs you?
It was Jamie.

285
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,950
Jamie,
Jamie,

286
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,620
Jamie.
Jamie was saying,

287
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,220
we were talking about it that like,
they are a lot like hieroglyphs.

288
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,930
Like if you,
if you send someone,

289
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,670
like I,
you one of the reasons why I thought it

290
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:49,260
was Eddie,
because Eddie always sends me like a

291
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:52,050
series of emojis like in a row,
you know?

292
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,070
And it's fine.
He's just being funny.

293
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,630
Like I'll send me a clown and a thumbs
up and a black fist.

294
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,150
Oprah Jean and my two favorites.
The obor Jean Jean.

295
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,160
When you come for gene,
an eggplant.

296
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,530
Oh,
I call it no,

297
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:05,620
Brazil.
Did you know what it is?

298
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,540
I know what you mean now,
but,

299
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,510
uh,
why is it an eggplant at the favorite

300
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:11,470
one?
I just like it.

301
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,380
It looks rude and funny.
See,

302
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm,
I'm Italian,

303
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:17,490
so I feel like it's racist.
I see eggplants.

304
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh,
of course.

305
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,350
You're like,
it's a direct your wrath on me.

306
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm so sorry.
But,

307
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:22,301
uh,
I feel like,

308
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:25,330
uh,
there's like a racist term for black

309
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:26,530
people.
Okay.

310
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:27,640
Now you're just being,
no,

311
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,470
no.
It is amongst amongst Italians.

312
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,140
It really is.
Yeah.

313
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,240
Eggplants.
Yeah.

314
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,030
Why?
What is the word?

315
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,460
What's that word?
That Italian word that they use?

316
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,310
There's a,
see if he can google it.

317
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,940
Race,
Italian word for eggplant used.

318
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,640
It's like it's a common thing and like
the east coast.

319
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,000
What is,
I don't get the race thing.

320
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,020
I swear to God.
What does it,

321
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,210
a couple of choices I guess.
Yeah,

322
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,450
there's a word that they would always
use.

323
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,740
Miliion.
Yeah.

324
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,130
Moving Yon is an Italian derogatory
slang term for a black person and it's

325
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:07,231
derived from the word egg plant.
We're a melon Zion,

326
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,283
which is,
uh,

327
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,550
which is a term for eggplant spinets.
Right.

328
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,550
I'm so sorry.
I made it impossible for you to use

329
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,230
eggplant now without thinking about it.
Back to the lipstick Emoji.

330
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,230
So we've killed Red Indian and we've
killed eggplant on one podcast.

331
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,230
Yeah.
Indian was the thing that like you could

332
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:29,770
say all the time when I was a kid,
but now if he even accidentally like

333
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,650
slips out of my mouth,
like you don't say cowboys and Indians

334
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:33,650
anymore,
I suppose.

335
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,210
Say like cowboys and native Americans
but doesn't roll off the tongue as

336
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:41,730
quickly,
but we can make our habits can cause we

337
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:43,420
of all we are,
we're trying,

338
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:44,920
we're disciplined.
I know your discipline.

339
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm trying.
We work at it.

340
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,810
How do you know,
cause I've read some stories about how

341
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:53,370
you hold yourself together over time and
that's,

342
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,100
that takes,
that takes discipline and I dunno,

343
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,060
I think it takes a lot of balls
actually.

344
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,220
Hmm.
I'll just leave it there.

345
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,460
Thank you sir.
Appreciate it.

346
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,130
Thank you.
Well,

347
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,470
you got to say bullocks though,
don't you?

348
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,810
Did you just say it in a positive way?
That it takes a lot of bullocks?

349
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,900
It takes a little bullets.
Did you say that would just hit that

350
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:11,591
way?
No,

351
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,630
I say bowls cause I,
I don't know.

352
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,570
I like the word bowls.
Yeah.

353
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,910
Something to do with Max and bullocks is
too hard for me to see.

354
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,250
But bollix is like bullshit too,
right?

355
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,530
Oh well yeah,
that I would use.

356
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,890
That's bullocks.
But that's also balls,

357
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,000
right?
Correct.

358
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,730
But it's used in a slightly different,
how could balls be bullshit.

359
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm so confused,
but the confusion,

360
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,830
that's okay.
I'm going with it.

361
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,070
I'm totally going with it.
I'm flexible.

362
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,660
I tried to be more flexible as I get
older.

363
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,010
I work on that.
It's hard to remain flexible is really a

364
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:49,330
challenge and I think that's what
differentiates the sheep from the goats.

365
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,770
What's better?
Sheep or goat?

366
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,870
The goat.
The greatest of all time.

367
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,470
I love the gold,
but then I'm partial tear sheet.

368
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,110
I was reading this article,
uh,

369
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,460
yesterday about music and they were
talking about how people get very rigid

370
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,820
in their musical tastes like what they
liked when they were younger.

371
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,820
They get to a certain stage in their
life and then they just lock on and any

372
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:12,860
new music,
they just sort of reject a logical

373
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:13,700
reason for that.
Right?

374
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:14,451
Yeah.
Yeah.

375
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,290
What is it?
Do you know

376
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,870
it's something to do within the pathways
in your brain?

377
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:20,620
I don't know that the first,
when you first meet these insane

378
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,020
connections and it's usually during
adolescence apparently.

379
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,940
Yeah.
You make these connections with I

380
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,090
suppose,
adventure and you know,

381
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,090
independence.
I mean,

382
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,440
I don't know.
I don't know enough about it,

383
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:34,070
but they have done all these studies
during studies on the brain,

384
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,860
on dementia.
They've discovered all these incredible

385
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,890
neurological pathways that are formed by
music and somebody can't even remember

386
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,290
how to,
you know,

387
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,250
button their shirt,
but they can sing every single word and

388
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:48,800
every note perfectly to some opera that
they,

389
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,840
they performed when they were young.
I mean,

390
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:51,890
I don't know.
It's crazy.

391
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,370
Crazy.
There's,

392
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,780
there's definitely weird pathways that
get established in the brain and they

393
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:02,100
say that like there's something about
music and especially like musical

394
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:07,020
pathways that literally invoke these
physiological changes in a person that

395
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:08,850
are unlike anything else.
Like it.

396
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:13,851
Like when I was a kid that rocky I,
the tiger song would come on and he was

397
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:17,770
just the stairs,
you would just want to start running.

398
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,240
You would just want to lift weights or
just run up a hill or something like

399
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,850
that.
I mean it would make your body change.

400
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,420
It was like if that was a drug,
if you could take that drug,

401
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,760
if he could sniff it,
like and like feel how you felt when

402
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:30,840
that song came on.
And be like,

403
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:33,060
yeah,
right.

404
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,560
I mean,
what else does that,

405
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,430
there's nothing else it does.

406
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,041
No,
that's true.

407
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,610
There is nothing else that does that.
I'm currently on this mad obsession with

408
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:40,910
oliver sacks.
Oh.

409
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,370
And uh,
I was,

410
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,480
I'm reading his biography right now or
autobiographies dicey and he's talking

411
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:52,501
about some of his like really sick
patients who have dementia or there's

412
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:56,920
some other form weird vitus that shuts
them down completely and they can't even

413
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,650
stand really.
And then if they play a certain piece of

414
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,670
music,
someone who is essentially an

415
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,800
unconscious being snaps to,
stands up and can dance and like recite

416
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,690
words,
even though they'd been newt for years.

417
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:11,860
I mean,
really crazy,

418
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:12,790
crazy stuff.

419
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,580
Yeah.
There's something about that art form

420
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,290
about your art.
Music can heal you.

421
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,030
Don't put your hands,
feel it.

422
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,590
I felt it.
I felt in charge my whole body,

423
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:25,450
my hair stood up on him.
What hair I have left.

424
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,790
Yeah,
there's something to it.

425
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,190
There's something to it that's like,
I mean,

426
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:33,910
and it's also very bizarre because it's
something that people have created,

427
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:35,380
right?
And it's not something that exists in

428
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:37,150
nature.
It makes beautiful sounds in nature,

429
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:40,570
like birds chirping and certain animal
noises and things that are beautiful.

430
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,740
But music is like the,
the,

431
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,340
the ability to control notes,
right?

432
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:51,750
The ability to a symphony,
the ability to structure a song and put

433
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,610
it together with a beautiful voice like
yours.

434
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,970
Like that is something that's entirely
created by a human being.

435
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,220
Like,
that didn't exist before.

436
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,670
Human beings existed and it works only
on us.

437
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,550
He ever played music for a dog.
These fucking stare at you.

438
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,850
They don't give a shit.
Dogs have shitty music.

439
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:11,370
Tastes might talk with response to
music.

440
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,790
Well,
maybe your dog does make sense.

441
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,170
Yeah.
I suppose she's trained that way.

442
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,440
Yeah.
Most probably.

443
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:21,441
Maybe feels like it's important to you
to give me to like a shitty person.

444
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,870
You know,
usually they have a shitty dog because

445
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,320
the dog is getting much shitting on
really,

446
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,180
he's taught them shitty manners,
but then the dog becomes sure.

447
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,130
They like if a dog bite your face off,
that's shitty dog.

448
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,993
Okay.
Fair enough.

449
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,850
Although I would argue it's a scared
dog,

450
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:36,960
but I'll give you that.
I agree.

451
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,100
I or terribly trained dog.
Yeah.

452
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,953
Yeah.
It's a problem.

453
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,910
I agree.
I agree.

454
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,430
Um,
but there's,

455
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,130
there,
there's,

456
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,120
there's something that we've done with
this that I think is really,

457
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,060
um,
I think it taps into the human reward

458
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,360
system in a way that the human reward
system,

459
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,980
like when people enjoy being around
certain people,

460
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,660
there's a,
there's like rewards,

461
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:01,830
just like social rewards.

462
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,900
You get from it.
Like say if we have like a leader.

463
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,561
Yeah,
yeah.

464
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,900
We're having a fun time having a fun
conversation and laugh.

465
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,380
But like say if like you were in a tribe
of people and there was this one leader

466
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,290
or this one,
uh,

467
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,680
you know,
warrior that saved you from the Jaguar

468
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,450
and you would look up to that person
like that,

469
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,600
that's like a hero in a movie right now
when we tap into these ancient reward

470
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,900
systems,
I think there were ways that human

471
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:29,550
beings could learn and ways that we
could share energy with each other that

472
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
existed before media,
before music,

473
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:36,960
and before movies and books.
And I think what we've done with media,

474
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,990
music and books and movies especially,
is tap into those human reward system

475
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,020
since really crazy that I'm really into,
I love this idea.

476
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,990
There is hope for the human race after
all.

477
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,670
Oh,
there's definitely hope were awesome

478
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,230
people that awesome them.
Yeah,

479
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:55,350
we suck sometimes,
but there's a few who suck,

480
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,380
but it's not even 1% is that tree.
I think it's maybe 1% I think that if

481
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:03,480
you get 300 million people like we have
in America,

482
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,320
you get about 3 million douche bags.
That's what I think.

483
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,960
That's fair.
And then you have also people that are

484
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,590
the same victims as your dog.
That's a bad dog.

485
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,150
Like give people that are born and
raised in horrible environments and

486
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:22,290
abused when they're young.
And I think that's a giant part of the

487
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,300
problem,
a giant part of what we are.

488
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,890
And if we,
we just addressed that.

489
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,060
It's one of the main problems that I
have with our culture is that we don't

490
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:35,061
address at really at all the raising of
children and the doing it from the

491
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,380
beginning as a culture.

492
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,520
But we don't address betty much.
That's painful or dark or complicated,

493
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,900
do we?
Not really.

494
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:45,390
We don't talk about death,
which I think is a big mistake because

495
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:48,700
then you have your people to not live
their lives fully because they're so

496
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:51,460
scared of dying.
They spend their whole lives wedding and

497
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,260
we'll get you can sick to talk about it.
My parents don't want to talk about it.

498
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,410
I just think that's so crazy.
It's as though if you don't talk about

499
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,670
it,
it's going to go away somehow.

500
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,270
Like I don't want to deal with it.
Let's talk about something else.

501
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,670
Let's go get dessert.
It's weird.

502
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:10,720
People just shut off.
You mentioned anything difficult just

503
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:13,780
shuts down a conversation.
Well that was one of the main problems

504
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:18,490
that a lot of psychologists had with
hiding caskets.

505
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,860
Like when they were bringing people back
from the war,

506
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,180
that they were taking these photographs
of the caskets and they wouldn't let

507
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:25,870
them be released.

508
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,470
Like it was a big thing during the Bush
administration in America and um,

509
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,320
psychologists were saying,
do you understand like this is your,

510
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:37,120
you are programming people to have a
very specific notion of war then because

511
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,460
you're not showing them the actual
consequences here.

512
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,210
I mean in a casket is almost a symbolic
consequence cause you're only seeing a

513
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,640
box and you know that a person,
a child's,

514
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,490
you know,
some parents child is in that box.

515
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,740
You're not,
you're not even seeing the body.

516
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,500
Like you're not even saying we should
see the body so people can understand

517
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,330
what a,
what a missile does to a person.

518
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,040
You're saying like the boxes themselves
are forbidden to be shown.

519
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,200
That's crazy.
Yeah.

520
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,990
Well it's just,
it's weird.

521
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:05,800
It's psychological warfare and a lot of
ways on the people because it allows

522
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:08,800
people to accept the consequences in
some sort of a weird,

523
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,300
almost abstract way.

524
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,280
They're not,
they're not seeing the consequences.

525
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:16,360
So sanitizing everything and allowing
people to grow and expand.

526
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,230
It shrinks our minds in a way.
The less we see,

527
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,870
the less we can think about it,
the less we're capable of thinking about

528
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:26,890
it in a way.
But it goes back to like the idea of,

529
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,980
of reading children and that goes back
to education as well and that we seem to

530
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:35,080
have fallen by the wayside there too.
Well I think we have,

531
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:38,650
but my feeling that human reward system,
it was much more uplifting.

532
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,350
Why think it's all connected?
Because I think that what we're doing

533
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:45,160
with technology in the form of music and
movies and media and all that thing is

534
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:50,161
just one step in this multifaceted
experience that we have integrating

535
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:53,050
technology and,
and the more,

536
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,720
the more sophisticated this technology
gets,

537
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:59,050
it seems like the closer it brings
people and ideas.

538
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,840
And I think that that's,
I honestly,

539
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:05,080
I mean people think that it's um,
I have too much of a utopian view of it,

540
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:10,081
but I really feel like that technology
is essentially going to balance it all

541
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:13,030
out.
I really feel like as much as we want to

542
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:17,410
try to hold back information and we try
to hold back education or try to program

543
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:19,930
people,
I feel like technology is ultimately

544
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:24,931
going to connect people instantaneously
with ideas and that you're not going to

545
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,250
be well yeah,
sort of,

546
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,140
but you could,
you could push it aside.

547
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,610
You could shut it off.
You could walk away.

548
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,590
If you have discipline,
you can leave your phone at home and go

549
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,980
for a walk in the woods.
But I feel like we're just one or two

550
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,670
generations away from being a completely
different thing than we are now.

551
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,610
That's the thing that bums me out about
dying.

552
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,230
That's the really,
pretty much the only thing is how much

553
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,750
we are going miss

554
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,690
of all the great technological advances.
Like how crazy is it gonna get it's

555
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:52,850
gonna get crazy.
I know and I'm so sad.

556
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,820
I'm going to miss so much of it.
You might not miss it because you're on

557
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,780
the tip right now of the scientific and
medical advancements that are going to

558
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:02,210
allow people to live to be 300 400 years
ago.

559
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:04,030
To hope not.
It's very possible.

560
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,190
Really,
really hope that cause you worry about

561
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:12,191
overpopulation and and yes,
and the calcification of the human mind.

562
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,050
I worry the Donald Trump's going to live
to be a thousand.

563
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,640
Oh God.
We all worry a wee bit.

564
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:18,020
It's got a lot of money.
Yeah,

565
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,210
sure it does.
It's pretty healthy for a fat guy too.

566
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,000
I was thinking that the other day he
goes out there super active.

567
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,400
Why is he so preoccupied with fast food?
It's really peculiar when you've got all

568
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:32,540
this money and you're stuffing your face
full of the cheapest food you can find

569
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:37,541
doesn't apparently he's got a huge fast
food preoccupation.

570
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,560
Maybe it's a president thing because
Bill Clinton did too.

571
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,880
There was a huge issue.
Clinton,

572
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,030
why he was up fast,
but he had no,

573
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,250
yeah,
all cut up with poor bill.

574
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,090
So what time press,
you can't eat fatty foods all time.

575
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:50,871
We're sloppy.
Well,

576
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:55,740
it's real.
Sugary and cheap crap is right.

577
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,330
Every and again,
every now and again to get one of those

578
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,270
Wendy's double doubles,
those double cheeseburgers.

579
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,770
They used to have the double
cheeseburger in my life ever.

580
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,620
Why?
I couldn't get my,

581
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,680
even I couldn't get my jobs right and
he really never had a double

582
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,320
cheeseburger.
I've never had a double tees,

583
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,450
but how long have you been in America?

584
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,090
Ooh,
I,

585
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,690
11 years and no nonsense.
No one 22 years.

586
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,361
Yes,
of course.

587
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,760
A good to know.
Get a single cheeseburger in and out.

588
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,090
Is that a double?
That'd be

589
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,523
my jobs.
Right.

590
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,860
That,
and I've never had a double level.

591
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
So what do you get?
I don't know.

592
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:30,290
I get,
I've never ordered it.

593
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:33,600
My husband's always the one that's sort
of what I want.

594
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,450
I wish he was,
maybe he was for like the first,

595
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,850
you know,
couple of weeks that we were together

596
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:46,280
when he's really trying hard to work kit
and that has long been left in the dust.

597
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,530
I can assure you like literally I have
to beg,

598
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,530
I had a friend of mine before,
he's,

599
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,870
he's married now,
but before he was married he had gone

600
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:56,060
through a series of like really horror
in this relationships.

601
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,200
And we were sitting around talking once
we were super high and he goes,

602
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:02,540
uh,
I think what I'm going to do is just

603
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,670
have two weak relationships.
He goes,

604
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,670
because two weeks is like the perfect
amount of time you're in love,

605
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,060
you're in love,
you want to spend all the time together,

606
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:13,370
it's great.
Then he goes and then somewhere around

607
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,210
them they just start expecting things
from you and then they get mad at you.

608
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,600
He's just picking the wrong partners
clearly.

609
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,320
Clearly cause he's married now.
Years I think is like a good honeymoon

610
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,520
pdf.
Two years.

611
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,950
Really.
Most things can go ogs in two years,

612
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,530
especially if you're dating an actor.
I've never dated an knocked her my life

613
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:34,910
for you.
Congratulations.

614
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,340
I couldn't deal with that.
Did you?

615
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,920
Actresses,
not no dudes,

616
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:45,010
but a girl be say actor like girls want
to be called actors now.

617
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,610
Like it's non gender specific these
days.

618
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,230
Fair enough.
I get that.

619
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,280
Yeah,
it makes sense.

620
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,260
Yeah,
totally get that I guess.

621
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,570
Yeah,
because actress or Comedienne,

622
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,690
that was a big one.
Can we like female comics do not like

623
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,170
that?
Don't like being called comedian.

624
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,230
Oh,
it makes you seem like a cheapened down

625
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:04,380
comic.
Like my funny comedian friends and

626
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:07,020
happen have vaginas.
They're all comedians.

627
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,120
Yeah,
I get that.

628
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,580
I really do get that out of respect that
the only thing is,

629
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:12,870
I love the word actress.

630
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,550
Actress is a pretty word word,
comedian sounds like a light version of

631
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,580
comedian.
Comedian doesn't have the same kind of

632
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,810
Gravitas.
Right?

633
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
Low Fat yogurt or something,
you know?

634
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,270
Yeah.
I never thought of it that way.

635
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,940
But yeah,
I think the more we get rid of gender

636
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,070
actually the better.
You think so?

637
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,890
But isn't it fun to be a girl?
It is fun to be a girl,

638
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:37,260
of course.
And I think it's fun to be all genders

639
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:39,000
and because whoever you hire,
whoever you are,

640
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:41,880
but I think when you are,
when you're,

641
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,060
you have to be called something.
It's like prison.

642
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,400
I don't think we should be living in
prisons.

643
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,960
Yeah,
but we're not living in prisons,

644
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,770
but we clearly are different.
Like especially you and I.

645
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,070
Of course you and I are very,
we're very different.

646
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,890
Very different.
It'd be super confused.

647
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,960
If you're anything like me,
I'd be like,

648
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,021
yeah,
no,

649
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:04,590
but I think you all humans,
we're all different,

650
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:05,090
right?

651
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,440
I mean,
I think it's crazy that we get put into

652
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:09,990
these generalized packs.
We kind of do.

653
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,280
Yeah.
But there's also just mean there's a

654
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:17,970
broad spectrum of behavior that is on
one side of the fence or the other side

655
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,350
of the fence,
whether it's male or female,

656
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,940
but there's definitely a male and female
when in in most people,

657
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,380
and then there's people that are,
you know,

658
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,150
then it gets real weird.
People that are born or in some way

659
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,430
don't want to be whatever gender they
are.

660
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,430
I think it's Kinda cool that they don't
want to be,

661
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:39,030
they just aren't.
I think some people just aren't and some

662
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,340
people don't want to be.
And I think it's like we were talking

663
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:44,750
about earlier about that Rachel Dolezal
willing to disagree here.

664
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,660
Well,
this is what I think.

665
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,730
I don't think we could ever possibly
know.

666
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:52,140
The motivation for every single person
was transgender or trans racial or

667
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:53,460
trans,
anything gender.

668
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,440
There was not,
as you knew yourself,

669
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,890
under no circumstances do you choose
your gender.

670
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,900
You don't.
You're not that powerful.

671
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:05,070
I don't think most people do,
but I think some people,

672
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,490
it's entirely possible that you could be
a woman and decide,

673
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:10,320
you know what?
I want to be a fucking man.

674
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,090
I'm tired of this.
I don't like it.

675
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,920
It's,
it's well within the realm of

676
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,250
possibility,
different thing,

677
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,781
isn't it?
I mean,

678
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:18,540
you're right and I'm sure that there are
circumstances like that,

679
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:21,780
but of that I think is a different thing
entirely maybe,

680
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,840
but would it be any less legitimate?
It'd be any less legitimate if a woman

681
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:31,980
felt compelled just by curiosity to
become a man versus compelled by her

682
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:35,460
feeling.
I think that's identity flirtation as

683
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:40,461
opposed to gender flirtation or gender
chilies or gender manifestation.

684
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm using the wrong words here.
I think people could do whatever the

685
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:50,320
fuck they want to that.
I met that Lizard Dude once in Austin,

686
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,730
Texas.
Do you know that guy is?

687
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,270
He's turned himself into a lizard.
He's essentially tattooed his entire

688
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:58,000
body.
The split his tongue down the middle.

689
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,120
You sat in the front row of my show at
the Cap City comedy club and I was like,

690
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,480
well,
you don't need a lot of attention to you

691
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:03,220
buddy.
Yeah.

692
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,280
Sitting right in the fucking front row
looking like a lizard.

693
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,980
Very nice guy though.
Seemed like a super nice guy.

694
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,930
But he's a,
you know,

695
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,750
I mean look at this guy,
well that,

696
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,150
that's before he did his whole face.
He's got some amazing,

697
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,420
yeah.
Uh,

698
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,330
definitely weird.
I don't know about amazing.

699
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:21,520
If that was my kid.
And come on,

700
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,620
if you saw that in an art gallery,
he would be like,

701
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,350
that is amazing.
Maybe you and I have a different sense

702
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:28,240
of amazing.
Maybe we do.

703
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,030
Well that seems like a guy was drawing
on his face.

704
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,660
Uh Huh.

705
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,300
But Hey,
this is coming from a guy with drawing

706
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,130
all over his arms.
That's pretty incredible.

707
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,570
I mean,
who am I to say that it's,

708
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,221
I mean,
this is like,

709
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:39,220
that's a cultural thing,
right?

710
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:43,450
Like why is it okay that I have tattoos
all over my arms and I don't think it's

711
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,880
right to tattoo your face.
I wouldn't say that like you should do,

712
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,200
be able to do whatever the fuck you
want.

713
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,280
Yeah.
And he has done,

714
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,440
but it's a cultural thing.
I mean,

715
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,560
for some people,
like I was in Japan and they made me,

716
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:58,270
I was in a gym and they made me go and
put a long sleeve shirt on because you

717
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:01,510
can't have exposed tattoos like this.
Well I guess cause their feelings

718
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,150
towards your arms at the same feelings
that you're having towards it.

719
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,830
For one second,
the Lizard has a little bit,

720
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,630
a little bit,

721
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,780
just for those of you who are not in the
studio right now who are listening to

722
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,620
just,
just,

723
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,790
just take my word for it that Joe is
fucking with me right now.

724
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,160
No,
I'm not fucking with you guys.

725
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,003
Yes.

726
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,733
Ah,

727
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,270
fun.
That's a fun conversation.

728
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,550
When don't you think,
when someone's fucking with you,

729
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,760
that's like a negative thing,
right?

730
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,360
No.
Oh God,

731
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:32,940
no,
no.

732
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,130
I often fought for fun.

733
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,370
Okay.

734
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,930
Oh,
I think we just did a,

735
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,880
uh,
we just do a play on words there.

736
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,460
Hey,
life on us yet.

737
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,050
Exactly.
Yeah.

738
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,400
So,
um,

739
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,860
so what's the latest with you?
You guys are touring again?

740
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,760
Uh,
we're going on too in the summer.

741
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,120
Yeah.
That's the only like month away or

742
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:56,970
something like that way.
Yeah.

743
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,360
It's hot as fuck here now.
Last fucking minute.

744
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,020
Stop.
Yeah.

745
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,640
It used to rain.
I like it cold,

746
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,900
I must admit.
But we are going out into your,

747
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,320
we're good.
We're going to do something in my mind,

748
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,110
pretty sort of historical in a funny
way.

749
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,900
Like we go,
go going at now headline two or with a

750
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
blondie.
Whoa.

751
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,990
Legendary.
Debbie Harry.

752
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,730
Wow.
Do you know her?

753
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,140
I do know her actually.
I love,

754
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,120
and I love her and she's been somewhat
of a mentor to me in a way because she

755
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:34,090
was managed by a very famous music
manager called Geico first who managed

756
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:36,450
the ramones and talking heads and body
and so on,

757
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,140
so forth.
He was the one who basically start

758
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,280
plucked me from my band.

759
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,680
He saw him at that.
He thought I had potential and he just

760
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:45,380
let you know I,
I think you have potential to be in the

761
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,170
music business.
And he signed me in the end and blah,

762
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:48,591
blah,
blah,

763
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,041
blah,
blah.

764
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,740
And Anyway,
he introduced me to Debbie and Debbie

765
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:55,400
came and saw my band opened for the
ramones and the academy in New York

766
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:59,360
during the new music seminar one year.
And I was shaking like a leaf.

767
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:02,240
I've told this story a million times,
but it's one of my favorite memories of

768
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:05,420
stepping out on stage on the academy.
And of course ramones fans that were

769
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:06,500
pretty hardcore,
you know,

770
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,270
they weren't taking fools lately.
Yeah.

771
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,310
And you had to prove yourself.
So I was very,

772
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:13,670
very nervous and I looked down into the
mosh pit and Debbie Harry was there and

773
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:17,570
I just was like,
I will love you forever asking me.

774
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:20,870
I am your slave.
You are like for someone of that caliber

775
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:24,110
to do that,
it meant so much to me and as sort of

776
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,600
even in times of when I've doubted
myself,

777
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,300
I always think Debbie didn't take me.

778
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,200
Wow.
So yeah,

779
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,400
that excites typical night with our,
wow,

780
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:35,200
that's heavy.
I might tear up tier.

781
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,780
Come on to your butt a little bit.
Come on,

782
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,450
get into the,
you know,

783
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,460
the emotional thing.
She was a,

784
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:47,320
a very unique historical figure in
music.

785
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,060
There was no Debbie Harry before Debbie
Harry Caray.

786
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,923
It's like you can look

787
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,250
Debbie Hardy,
right?

788
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,040
There was no lady Gaga.
Yeah,

789
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,670
right.
She did it all really.

790
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,610
She's the archetype I think for a modern
pop girl.

791
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,280
And she was very authentic.
Like there was no questioning her

792
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:06,310
authenticity.
Like she was uniquely eccentric and it

793
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,061
still is.
Yeah,

794
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:08,140
I'd imagine.
Yeah,

795
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,090
70 and to be still making records,
thoughts,

796
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,220
incredible.
That's pretty bad ass.

797
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,760
It's really about us and really
inspiring for other women.

798
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:20,350
You know,
if we follow in our footsteps,

799
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:23,560
who you know,
will watch as the first time I can think

800
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,870
of like a woman has had a pop color you
over that long.

801
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,860
Well isn't it a new thing?
I mean if you really stop and think

802
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,560
about music,
really what we're talking about as

803
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:36,400
recorded music and recorded music in
modern times has really only been since

804
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:38,590
the late 20th century.
Right?

805
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,800
I mean when did people,
or the early 20th century rather,

806
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:44,020
when did people first start recording
music?

807
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:47,110
We've gone over this before.
They started doing it on wax and like

808
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:50,140
the 17 hundreds is that what it was?
Something along those lines?

809
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,980
I don't think it was that long.
I think it was in the early 19 hundreds

810
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,781
what's what's,
find out.

811
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:57,760
Let's see if he's going to set us and
add those wax cylinders that they were

812
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:01,210
recording talking and a little bit of
orchestra stuff on those.

813
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,320
Like right.
Those,

814
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,620
those,
you just pull that out of here?

815
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,061
No,
we've,

816
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,760
we've actually discussed this.
Yeah.

817
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,990
But yeah,
we were just one of your favorite

818
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:08,480
topics.

819
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,090
No,
we have discussed it like fairly

820
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:11,650
recently.
Within the last year we were talking

821
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,150
about how amazing it is that recording
things like,

822
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,160
like Mozart or Beethoven,
like there was no recording reading work

823
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,720
and you know,
people would duplicate that written work

824
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:27,410
and that's how you would get to see the
genius of their ideas here at 1877 oh

825
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,170
wow.
Okay.

826
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,600
That's a practical sign recording.
Yeah.

827
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,460
But when you compare that to like a
record,

828
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,310
a modern,
I mean we call it a record,

829
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:41,090
but I mean a recording,
a modern recording like blondie,

830
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,530
like rapture or something like that.
I mean that is this,

831
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,230
there's never been anything like that in
human history up until the 19th or the

832
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:53,430
20th century.
I mean it really didn't exist.

833
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,070
No.
So when you think about like pop stars,

834
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,060
you know,
I mean at a May or however far can you

835
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:03,150
can go back to where you can
legitimately say someone was a popular

836
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:05,610
music star.
It is so recent.

837
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,500
It's within a hundred years.
Like Elvis,

838
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,500
I think it was the first popular star.
Right,

839
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,500
right.
Yeah.

840
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,900
That's why I went fucking crazy.
He's no,

841
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:13,860
no roadmap.

842
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,780
Yeah,
well none of them had road maps.

843
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:18,750
That's what we forget.
Like we were talking about this recently

844
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:20,670
with a bunch of friends is highly
accomplished.

845
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:24,930
Young musicians are right now,
like if they can be 15 years old and you

846
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:27,900
can watch them perform and they've got
all the moves and they can sing

847
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:31,230
perfectly because they've practiced
singing along on youtube too,

848
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,050
you know,
digitally enhanced recordings so they

849
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:36,150
can do stuff with their voice that we
never could,

850
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,190
you know.
And so they're learning at an

851
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:39,820
accelerated rate.
Yeah.

852
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,390
But they don't understand what it means
to have any kind of motivation or like

853
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:46,710
have any authentic taste or you know,
it's really peculiar.

854
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,960
They don't have a struggle yet.
They're like terminators.

855
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,641
No,
you know,

856
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,400
they're,
they're perfect but they don't have any

857
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
no inside.
They,

858
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,340
well I'm sure they do have an inside to
develop to 15 no one.

859
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:02,180
You can abort that up.
Who is like,

860
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,910
it's just off the charts.
But it's true.

861
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,050
It's insane.
Like it is.

862
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,940
They can sing along to these mat records
that have been old sort of,

863
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,910
you know,
auto,

864
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,050
auto autotune this,
that,

865
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,260
the next thing.
And they can sing it.

866
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:19,780
Perfect.

867
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,940
Well,
I was reading about this 24 year old

868
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:24,340
motivational speaker and a,
I was like,

869
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:26,830
I want to go find that person.
Tell them to shut the fuck up.

870
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,560
Hi.
Couldn't what do you 24 yeah.

871
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,000
What do you know?
What do you know at 24 you got a nine I

872
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:34,450
think at 50 tell people about life at 24
that's preposterous.

873
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,560
Yeah,
it's preposterous.

874
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,030
It's like my friend Steve Maxwell says,
he said you should never listen to

875
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,420
anyone who is under 40 who is a personal
trainer.

876
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:45,760
He's a personal trainer.
He's like anyone who is under 40 was a

877
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:48,130
personal trainer is and what the fuck do
they know about injuries?

878
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,680
You yeah,
doing the running the long haul.

879
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,540
Yeah.
There's a lot to learn.

880
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,160
There's a lot.

881
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,660
There is I,
I am amazed.

882
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:57,090
I continue.
I thought I had also state by 30 I mean

883
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,850
I remember thinking I'm so old and I'm
so wise.

884
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,810
I mean I remember thinking that and then
you hit 50 and you're like,

885
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,150
oh my God,
I knew nothing.

886
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,950
Yeah.
And then you probably think that when

887
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,320
you're 70 my.claims.
That's the case.

888
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,090
He laughs at me and my dad laughs at me
when I,

889
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:15,060
you know,
say something that he thinks it's

890
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:16,530
absolutely ludicrous,
you know?

891
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:17,570
And he's like,
just you wait,

892
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,660
just wait.
You'll,

893
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,040
you'll eat those words,
you know?

894
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,790
Well,
I feel like that's a big part of what

895
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:26,780
you see today in social media with young
kids espousing really preposterous

896
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:30,560
ideas.
Just like there's so they have so little

897
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:34,140
experience,
actual life experience or them.

898
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,070
Yeah.
I feel sad

899
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,380
for all these like young hipsters that
get lauded by,

900
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,110
you know,
fashion magazines at literally at the

901
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,840
age of 15.
I think it's the fetishizing of young

902
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:47,800
people right now really gives me the
creeps and I feel very sad for these

903
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:50,960
young people who basically get,
are like these beautiful butterflies and

904
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,820
uh,
you know,

905
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:55,390
a glass jar gets shoved on top of them
and then they're stuck.

906
00:38:55,391 --> 00:39:00,010
They're being cool and hip,
but not with no driver,

907
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,440
no,
no nothing to fight against,

908
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,320
nothing to be dissatisfied with.
I don't know,

909
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:08,020
it's just peculiar.
I think they're doing adderall and

910
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:12,550
having a great old time,
so I'm sure.

911
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,260
Oh,
so just because you made a bunch of

912
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,550
fucking hit records,
you think,

913
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,610
tell me how to live my life.
I live in this God damn glass jar.

914
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,450
Never for one moment would ever tell
somebody how to live their life.

915
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,050
What I don't like seeing is people not
being allowed to live their lives.

916
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,390
Oh,
I saw this kid,

917
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:30,400
somebody sent me this thing on twitter
at some kid,

918
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,680
I forget where it was,
some pop festival,

919
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,000
but he's like 12 years old playing the
guitar and he's fucking incredible.

920
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,170
I mean,
incredible.

921
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,080
And they were like saying he's the next
Jimmy Hendrix,

922
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,480
some little black kid.
It was amazing.

923
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,800
Like just like,
just unbelievably talented and I'm just

924
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:48,251
like,
boy,

925
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:50,950
he's checking with him 10 years.
He'll be fucking crazy.

926
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,620
That's what it feels like to me.
It's creepy.

927
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:56,800
It's like so many people send me,
you know,

928
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,750
uh,
recordings of young,

929
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,690
particularly young women,
um,

930
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,200
artists and they're like,
you know,

931
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:03,670
would you think about,
you know,

932
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,380
supporting this girl or what do you
think of this and that [inaudible] life,

933
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,430
right?
I think go like living your life.

934
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:12,240
Don't let your parents figured out your
career for you,

935
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:13,540
and that's what you're supposed to do.

936
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,000
You're not supposed to have your parents
who happens to have an end with a well

937
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,950
known singer or producer,
whatever,

938
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,480
pump pimping you,
you know,

939
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,910
that's,
that's how you learn is by actually

940
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:23,950
doing it yourself.
I don't know.

941
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:28,951
I just feel it's creepy and it feels
pedophilic to me and I don't like it.

942
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,200
It definitely can be right.
But when you were young,

943
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,360
when did you know that you wanted to be
a singer?

944
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,980
I don't think I ever knew I wanted to be
a singer and wants to be yes,

945
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,740
but fairly recently.
I mean,

946
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:44,440
literally in the last time I've seen and
the last 10 years,

947
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,930
I was like,
I'm really good at this actually.

948
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:50,320
And I enjoy it and I guess this is what
I do for a living.

949
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,460
This is my thing.
The last time,

950
00:40:52,461 --> 00:40:54,910
the last 10 years,
I'm not going on with you.

951
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,760
Like when stupid girl was coming out.
Well,

952
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:00,220
I felt like I'd stumbled into that
opportunity,

953
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:02,020
which I did.
Um,

954
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,610
I wanted to be,
first of all,

955
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,950
I wanted to be a writer,
then I wanted to be an actress.

956
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,520
And then by total default I was in a
youth theater when I was young and I met

957
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:13,120
this guy and he was like,
oh,

958
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:16,120
would you come and play keyboards in my
band for a weekend because we've lost

959
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:18,310
our keyboard player.
And I joined the band and then I just

960
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:21,790
ended up being in that band for 10 years
playing keyboards and doing backup

961
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,200
vocals.
I was quite happy.

962
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,780
I didn't have,
I didn't harbor any ambition to be a

963
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:30,781
lead singer at all.
And then just 1,000,000,001 things

964
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:36,181
happened and I ended up being the lead
singer of this betty seen band just so

965
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:41,150
that we could survive cause we'd been
dropped by our record label for going to

966
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:46,151
Berlin and spending all our money on our
record advance on drugs coming back and

967
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,330
not have anything to show for it.

968
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,460
So the record company dropped us but
kept me.

969
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,400
And so then I pulled the band in as my
band.

970
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,170
So we just sort of shifted all the
rules.

971
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,860
Oh Wow.
By myself as the lead singer by default

972
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,640
and then our videos on drugs.
Oh,

973
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:04,190
it was mostly speed and ecstasy.
Speed.

974
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,220
How much money you're spending on speed.
Jesus Christ.

975
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,720
It was,
I was in the northern,

976
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:12,110
that might money that it was our entire
record events.

977
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,840
How much was it?
I can't remember.

978
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:17,960
I think it was something like a hundred
thousand pounds.

979
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,610
What does that like $50,000 thing
American,

980
00:42:20,611 --> 00:42:22,340
somewhere on that.
I think it's double that.

981
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,170
Double the oats.
200,000 a stumble.

982
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,250
Oh,
I'm doing it the opposite.

983
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,100
Oh my God dude.
I told him no,

984
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:30,920
I don't know how we did it.
I mean it wasn't all on speed and it was

985
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,680
all Kahal and you know,
going and drink,

986
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,960
you know,
drinking and partying and just wasting

987
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:36,320
time.

988
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,050
And you have in America,
we call that going off.

989
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,160
We,
we went off,

990
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,290
you guys went off.
We went totally off too.

991
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,180
And I wasn't one of the,
the reason I was one of the sober ones

992
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:48,200
for the most part.
I mean,

993
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,940
you know,
and I know I did my share,

994
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:51,800
but by comparison I kept my shit
together.

995
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:52,510
But,
and we,

996
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:52,881
we,
we,

997
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:56,240
we used to dark opportunity there,
but by default I became a lead singer.

998
00:42:56,241 --> 00:43:00,380
Our video got played on mtv and then I
just chanced upon garbage.

999
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:03,190
The garbage boys needed a singer and I
got hired and,

1000
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,710
and so I always felt I just fumbled into
it by going off,

1001
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,140
so to speak.
That's crazy.

1002
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,001
Yeah,
it was,

1003
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:13,340
it was pretty mad.
And then I never believed in myself for

1004
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,870
my whole first half of my,
I call the first phase of garbage.

1005
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,333
Wow.

1006
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,240
You know,
that's a really common thing that we

1007
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:22,920
were just talking about this the other
day with somebody,

1008
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:25,560
I forget who it was,
whether they were saying that so many

1009
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,320
really talented people feel
illegitimate.

1010
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,310
They've felt like they're not
legitimate.

1011
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:30,390
Yeah.

1012
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,920
Are they filming?
Everybody feels like,

1013
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,960
I don't think it's even the artist.
I think it's everybody,

1014
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,300
you know who won't pay it and it sits
there and goes,

1015
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:37,230
yeah,
I'm my parent.

1016
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,390
Yeah.
I know how to parent my children and

1017
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,790
yeah,
I know how to pay the bills and get the

1018
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,670
work done and keep the high school.
Nobody knows how to do anything.

1019
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,550
Wow.
Well you definitely do question yourself

1020
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,080
all the time.
Yeah.

1021
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,940
Like you'll do your kids.
Well,

1022
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:52,230
I have a,
I have three.

1023
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,410
I have one that's 20.
I have one that's almost nine and one

1024
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:56,610
that's almost eight.
Wow.

1025
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,080
Yeah.
Or almost seven rather.

1026
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,630
And I was hanging out all day with the
almost seven yesterday.

1027
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,130
And uh,
you know,

1028
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,120
we're just having a great old time.
Like we have days we split up where I

1029
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:09,600
just hang out with one kid and my wife
will hang out with one kid because I

1030
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,430
think sometimes when you get the two of
them together,

1031
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:12,870
the young ones,
they don't get enough attention,

1032
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:14,700
especially the little one suffers a
little bit.

1033
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,240
So we have like specific days where it's
just,

1034
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,930
and so the entire time we're trying to
have a good time,

1035
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:23,520
we're having fun,
but I'm also thinking,

1036
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:25,740
okay,
I've got to like figure we're kind of,

1037
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:28,150
I'm kind of programming are here as this
go.

1038
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,930
So every question I have to kind of
temper this question,

1039
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,520
you have to think that these people
probably don't know any better.

1040
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:37,740
So that's probably why they litter,
you know?

1041
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,050
And see it like she gets mad when she
sees people throw cigarettes out the

1042
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:42,300
window.
I saw a guy throw a cigarette out the

1043
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:44,310
window.
Did you see that Daddy?

1044
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,990
He threw a cigarette out the window and
I'm like,

1045
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,870
well,
it's definitely not good to throw

1046
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:50,940
cigarettes out the window,
but you have to think like this poor

1047
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:53,220
person.
Like what kind of a mind do they have

1048
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,350
like this?
This the way their brain works.

1049
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,300
They think it's okay.
They're not worried.

1050
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,790
Like if I drop something on the ground,
I pick it up.

1051
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,870
Do you pick it up?
She's like,

1052
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:01,920
I always pick it up.
I go,

1053
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:03,150
yeah,
we pick things up,

1054
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:04,560
right?
We don't want to litter because if

1055
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:06,690
everybody livered we would never be able
to get anywhere.

1056
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,160
Just be garbage everywhere.
Stressful.

1057
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:10,320
Being a parent,
it's stressful,

1058
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:14,370
but when toward is theirs,
it's really,

1059
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,550
you don't have kids.
I do.

1060
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,240
It's very hard to describe to someone
the love that you experienced between

1061
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:24,540
you and this little tiny person like me
and the six,

1062
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:29,340
almost seven when when we talk like,
and she just jumps on me and hugs me,

1063
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,110
like my whole body has this reaction,
like the love meter.

1064
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,450
It's like,
you know a carnival thing where you hit

1065
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:38,730
the thing on the bottom and the bell
goes Ding.

1066
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:39,580
You know,
like the,

1067
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:42,090
the,
the metal sudden shoots up and hits the

1068
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,920
bell.
It hits the bell every time.

1069
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,380
Whenever she gives me this big hug,
it's like I can't,

1070
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,880
you can't love anybody anymore.
Of course the love that I have for hers,

1071
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,240
it's Cray.
It's weird.

1072
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:53,970
It's scary because you're worried about
losing them.

1073
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,830
It's scary because you're worried about
fucking it up.

1074
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:58,650
It's scary because just because it's so
powerful,

1075
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,410
really powerful changes you.
It changes who you are.

1076
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,510
I mean it's just a hundred percent
changed me.

1077
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,320
Just made me a different completely
different person and it does every day,

1078
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,990
every day.
I'm a different person than I was like a

1079
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,200
week ago and I talked to a lot of are
other my friends that have kids and it's

1080
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:17,600
the same thing like the,
it changes your level of compassion,

1081
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,460
the changes who you like.
Dave Chappelle said it best to me.

1082
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:24,900
He said it didn't just change my how
much I love,

1083
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:28,260
it changed my capacity for love.
And I was like,

1084
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:29,730
that's it.
I think you nailed it.

1085
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,650
I mean I had a tiny,
I have a tiny window into it cause my

1086
00:46:33,651 --> 00:46:36,710
sister,
my younger sister had two children and I

1087
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,210
felt towards her children differently
than I do any other child.

1088
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,260
So that's just a small window into how I
imagine it is for her with her children.

1089
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,670
And we talk about this a lot.
I'm like,

1090
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,950
I just don't think I could handle that.
It would be too,

1091
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:51,260
I'm to sent to,
I'm to hypersensitive to,

1092
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:54,000
I think take the responsibility on of
being a parent.

1093
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:54,110
Yes.

1094
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,340
I think though,
but you would,

1095
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,950
it changes you.
Like you become more wherever you are

1096
00:46:57,951 --> 00:47:00,260
now once if a little person comes out of
your body,

1097
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,940
you just,
you're like,

1098
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:03,380
okay,
now I'm surely with a person.

1099
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,690
There's like chapter two,
you know,

1100
00:47:05,691 --> 00:47:07,640
are surely 2.0 or whatever it is.

1101
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,940
Yeah,
I'm sure it changes how you view

1102
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:12,570
yourself and your function on Erath I
would imagine

1103
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,900
it does.
It does.

1104
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,810
And it also makes you appreciate like
my,

1105
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,510
my time is fairly,
um,

1106
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:23,230
it's flexible in terms of like I can
manipulate my time,

1107
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,920
I can kind of choose what I do.
Like I don't really have to do anything.

1108
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:28,390
I choose to do a lot of different
things,

1109
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,220
but that do have

1110
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,760
to do things like,
especially couples where both work and

1111
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:37,900
they work long hours.
That's incredibly hard to raise

1112
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:38,770
children.
I mean,

1113
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:41,440
you see how tired they're too,
when they come home from a nine,

1114
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,890
10 hour day and their kid has been in
daycare and the kid just can't wait to

1115
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:45,690
see them.
And then you,

1116
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,250
you literally only have an hour with
them before they go to bed.

1117
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,250
Like you're not even raising them.
Relationship was like,

1118
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,130
that was my dad's like when my mum died
a few years ago,

1119
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,150
my dad came over here to Los Angeles to,
to stay with us and we went out for

1120
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:00,100
lunch and I'm sitting across from my
dad,

1121
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,950
I'm 45 years old and I'm thinking to
myself,

1122
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,490
I have never sat alone with you in a
restaurant in my life ever.

1123
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,820
And it was really weird.
Wow.

1124
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,330
Because my dad worked hard,
you know,

1125
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:16,570
and he was always busy and yeah,
it was,

1126
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:18,280
it was an intense realization.

1127
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,260
So it's,
I think it's great that you take time

1128
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,640
one on one with your kids.
Cause I didn't have that with my dad.

1129
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,370
I didn't have that either.
I try to,

1130
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:25,241
well,
I mean,

1131
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:27,580
I'm sure they're going to learn
something that I fuck up that they're

1132
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:29,260
not going to do.
You just have to accept you're gonna

1133
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:31,960
fuck up.
Just don't try to fuck up.

1134
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,670
Don't try to try to do your best.
But I just,

1135
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,510
sometimes the things that you do in
inverted commas get right are the things

1136
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:44,470
that do I think the most damage and
sometimes the things that you do wrong.

1137
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,220
The so called big mistakes can also be
really good for children.

1138
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:52,030
And I'm not talking about when they're,
at no point should a child ever be hurt

1139
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,640
in any way.
You know?

1140
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:57,060
I'm not saying that's a good thing,
that that's a terrible thing and that

1141
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:57,790
must never happen.

1142
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,750
But I mean like,
you know,

1143
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:02,590
I know a lot parents who sort of really
get down on themselves because the

1144
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:06,910
divorce for a random example,
and I have seen children bloom through

1145
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,190
divorce,
you know,

1146
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,900
and I keep saying that some that to my,
some of my friends who are going through

1147
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:12,010
that,
it's like you're not,

1148
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,820
you're not making a big mistake.
You're teaching them to not settle and

1149
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:17,920
this good things that can come from bad
things.

1150
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,730
I guess it's what I'm trying to see.
Yeah,

1151
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,411
no,
for sure.

1152
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:23,940
My parents split up when I was five and
it was a very good thing and it,

1153
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:28,300
it taught me that my mom was strong for
leaving my dad and that like you have to

1154
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:32,440
make tough choices and then things are
going to suck for a while,

1155
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:34,960
but there's a reason for it.
But you know,

1156
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:39,990
pressure makes diamonds just,
I mean you said a much more articulately

1157
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:43,660
than I did,
but we're getting to the same police I

1158
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:44,050
guess.

1159
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:47,470
Yeah,
well it's a really uncomfortable moment

1160
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:50,140
that I have with a lot of my friends
that have children too because we sit

1161
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:51,280
around and we think about it.
We say,

1162
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:51,851
well,
you know what,

1163
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:53,980
you try to protect your kids as much as
possible,

1164
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,000
but everybody that we know that's
interesting came from a fucked up

1165
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:00,790
background.
Like all of my friends had fucked up

1166
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:01,600
childhoods.
Yeah,

1167
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,550
all of them.
All my artistic friends,

1168
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,000
all my friends that are musicians,
all my friends that are Comedians,

1169
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:11,080
they just fucking came from chaos and
they emerged from this rubble.

1170
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:14,140
Is this like this person with a purpose?
Absolutely.

1171
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,870
But see,
I've,

1172
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,800
I've gone quiet and I've gone quiet
because it's getting back to the,

1173
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,200
the,
the moment that I have are the feeling I

1174
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,420
have in myself that I am an inauthentic
artists.

1175
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:28,270
Cause I didn't come from a fucked up
background.

1176
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,490
All my friends,
every single one of my friends when I

1177
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:33,500
was growing up from the age of five
onwards,

1178
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,620
they came from broken homes.
Every single one maybe you learn from

1179
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:39,170
them is set.
And I don't know.

1180
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,730
But I came from a really happy family.
My mum would have penny.

1181
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,860
She baked every day.
What's a penny?

1182
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,581
A penny,
you know,

1183
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:47,780
an apron.
Oh,

1184
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:48,800
can I go?
I'm wearing right now.

1185
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,290
But um,
yeah,

1186
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,120
she bought a,
uh,

1187
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,500
an apron.
She baked every single day.

1188
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,980
She like warmed our clothes on the stove
before we went to school.

1189
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,120
She cooked us dinner every single night.
They would always at home.

1190
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:04,220
They were always there.
They loved us.

1191
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,390
They know we're never cruel.
I mean,

1192
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:10,130
I came from the most abnormal,
normal family ever.

1193
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:12,980
And it's always made me think,
well that means that I'm not,

1194
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,500
I'm just not,
not legit test.

1195
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:17,510
I'm not so crazy.

1196
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,650
Yeah,
I got fucked up anyway.

1197
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,040
Yeah,
but it's not a,

1198
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,540
it's not mandatory.
Like it's,

1199
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,610
it,
it certainly happens a lot of the time,

1200
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:31,340
but it can be mandatory all the time,
but I just don't,

1201
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,030
uh,
yeah,

1202
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,720
I like,
I,

1203
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,820
I always sort of feel,
and this is really sick of mild envy,

1204
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,110
when I hear my friends talk about,
you know,

1205
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:40,970
they're fucked up upbringings cause I'm
like,

1206
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:42,230
God,
I'm so normal.

1207
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,750
I used to feel that way about people who
are drug addicts.

1208
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,210
What do you mean?
I used to feel that way because all the

1209
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,900
greats,
the were drug out of Richard Pryor,

1210
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,300
Kennison Bill Hicks,
they were all drug addicts.

1211
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,700
Yeah.
They're all had like huge cocaine

1212
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:58,010
problems and they,
you know,

1213
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,440
Hicks was the only one that got through
it.

1214
00:51:59,441 --> 00:52:01,010
But then he wound up not dying of
cancer.

1215
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,241
You know,
who knows?

1216
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:04,220
Maybe because of that.
But you know,

1217
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,310
Kennison was a cocaine.
He kind says who's he?

1218
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:08,600
You don't know Sam Kennison?
No,

1219
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:10,090
I've never even heard of him.
Really?

1220
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,160
Wow.
He's Mount Rushmore for sure.

1221
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,620
He might be the greatest.
Well,

1222
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:18,050
I think Richard Pryor was the greatest,
but he's surprised he's right up there.

1223
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,830
Kinnisons like number two in my book.
I think that not heard of this person.

1224
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,790
I don't know.
I don't know how easily it was a fast

1225
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,880
break.
You never,

1226
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,550
you never seen him and recognize him.
Oh my God.

1227
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:30,320
This is like pull up

1228
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:34,870
Sam Kinison uh,
homosexual necrophilia acts.

1229
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,080
He did this pet,
this is a,

1230
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:41,650
this bit was it?
This is a bit that got explained to me

1231
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:44,740
by a girl that I used to work with.
This is a bit,

1232
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:47,170
I found out about this as par.
Pause for a second.

1233
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,260
I worked at a,
um,

1234
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,490
this is one of the reasons why I got
into standup comedy.

1235
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:54,310
I worked at an athletic club in South
Boston.

1236
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,830
It's called the Boston athletic club and
I worked with this girl.

1237
00:52:56,831 --> 00:52:58,480
She was hilarious.
She was a volleyball player,

1238
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:00,430
big giant girl.
She was like five,

1239
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:01,690
11.
Big Athletic,

1240
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,990
big personality,
easy,

1241
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:04,360
easy.
She's hilarious.

1242
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,760
But what I'm saying is she told me
about,

1243
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:08,800
you've got to see this community of the
Holy Shit.

1244
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:11,260
Was He funny?
She saw him on Hbo and so she starts

1245
00:53:11,261 --> 00:53:13,210
doing this bitch.
She's like,

1246
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,410
she takes me out to the parking lot and
she's doing this bit about,

1247
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,440
there's a real news story about these
homosexual necrophilia acts would pay

1248
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,000
these morgues to spend a few hours
undisturbed but the freshest male

1249
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,520
corpses,
so play a bit.

1250
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,400
He played the bit,
we'll play the video [inaudible] paper.

1251
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,950
They said okay.

1252
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:38,140
That a group of homosexual necrophilia
acts and going around the mortuaries

1253
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,360
offering them money,
let them come in at night.

1254
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,570
She's been a couple hours undisturbed
with the fresh Ishmael quarter.

1255
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,630
It wasn't trying to shell.
This is a fucking home game.

1256
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:58,480
All right.
It's a story I read folks.

1257
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,110
Jesus Christ,
give me a chance to do some journalistic

1258
00:54:02,111 --> 00:54:02,921
reporting here.
Well,

1259
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:06,310
yeah,
I felt the same way.

1260
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:08,350
I read this thing and what else?
Ah,

1261
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:14,470
thanks for that batch.
I had to have five of these corpses,

1262
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,990
man.
I mean you think death would be bad

1263
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:20,824
enough when,
yeah.

1264
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,410
The one thing that scares the shit out
of everybody is dead.

1265
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,230
You don't want to think about it.
You don't joke about it.

1266
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:28,870
You pull it out of your mind,
but you figure if you faced it,

1267
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,650
that's it.
What can be worse than Fucking Dad?

1268
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,670
He'd bring,
I got bashed.

1269
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,670
Dad hated up.
She lived through it.

1270
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:38,200
You know,
you got to buy it on shit.

1271
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,390
I that's try.
But he's courses because I know these

1272
00:54:40,391 --> 00:54:43,280
guys were laying out on slabs.
They're,

1273
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,390
and they're going well,
it was tough.

1274
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,320
And uh,
well that was pretty hard to live up to

1275
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,920
with the,
I have half page death and I'm glad I

1276
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,060
went through it and,
uh,

1277
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,270
well I'm just,
I'm ready to spend eternity in heaven

1278
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,640
and be with Jesus and Ragab age.
Hey.

1279
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,140
Oh,
I don't believe

1280
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,500
so.
This girl,

1281
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,740
she laid down in the parking lot and she
was gone.

1282
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,380
He'd be alive.
Cube's fuck in this.

1283
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,233
Even after you're dead.

1284
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,020
And I'm crying,
laughing.

1285
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,970
I was crying and I was like,
oh,

1286
00:55:31,971 --> 00:55:33,290
I got to see this.
I got to see this.

1287
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,020
And so I think I got it from a video
store,

1288
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:39,200
I think it was back when you would rent
it from a vhs cassette.

1289
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,960
And that's how I found out about Sam
kinison.

1290
00:55:41,961 --> 00:55:44,930
And that's one of the reasons why I got
into standup comedy because I didn't

1291
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:48,200
know that common he was ever like that.
I thought comedy was a guy who just

1292
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:49,670
stood in front of the microphone and
said,

1293
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,380
did you ever notice that kind of stuff.
So what was,

1294
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,280
what does well is being a comedian to
you mean?

1295
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:57,050
No.
Oh it's a bunch of different

1296
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:59,120
possibilities,
but it was so chaotic.

1297
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:02,420
Like his,
his comedy was so wild and crazy.

1298
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Like there was,
he was a real ground breaker in that

1299
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:07,940
way.
And why else did you get into being a

1300
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:10,950
comedian?
I Dunno.

1301
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,370
I got talking to,
you know,

1302
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,490
I wasn't really very funny.
I wasn't teaching any siblings.

1303
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,360
One sister.
Yeah.

1304
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,890
So it's just you and your mom and

1305
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,500
your sister?

1306
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,260
Yeah,
well my mom remarried my Stepdad who

1307
00:56:27,261 --> 00:56:28,580
she's still with it.
And do you like him?

1308
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,450
Yeah,
he's great guy.

1309
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:30,860
Okay.
Yeah,

1310
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,540
super lucky.
He's a real good guy.

1311
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,350
Okay,
good.

1312
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,600
But um,
it was uh,

1313
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,830
I got talked into doing stand up by my
friends from martial arts

1314
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,130
for real,
cause we would,

1315
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:44,690
well you must've been funny.
Well,

1316
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:47,360
I was only funny,
but I was glad gallows humor we would go

1317
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:48,980
to compete like,
like,

1318
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:51,320
or we would be about to spar and I would
be,

1319
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:54,080
the guy would make everybody laugh
because everybody was so nervous because

1320
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:55,760
it was scary.
You beat the shit out of each other,

1321
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:57,260
you know?
And then we would go to these

1322
00:56:57,261 --> 00:57:01,880
competitions so he'd get on a bus and
travel across the country to go fight in

1323
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:04,520
these tournaments.
And it was super nerve wracking.

1324
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:08,090
Everyone was super nervous so you could
cut the tension with a knife.

1325
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,630
So I would always like be doing
impressions of people having sex and

1326
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,430
making jokes.
And just,

1327
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,610
this was like long before ever thought
about being comedian.

1328
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,320
I was just trying to lighten up the
mood.

1329
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,360
Wow.
And that's how I got into stand up.

1330
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,520
So hold on a minute.
So see,

1331
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:26,400
this is a bit of a surprise to me
because when people fight,

1332
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,650
you know,
semi professionally or otherwise,

1333
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,010
or at school or what have you,
it's nerve wracking.

1334
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,400
No,
it's terrifying because you're scared of

1335
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,833
pain,

1336
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,190
violence,
the anticipation of the possibility of

1337
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:45,120
losing.
You're worried about the just all the

1338
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:46,700
possibilities,
the,

1339
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,090
there's just a full realm of things.

1340
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,050
Why do you do it?
I know I'm sounding like a mortar on,

1341
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,290
I just have never had the opportunity to
ask anyone who's ever done this.

1342
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,170
Um,
I was very insecure and um,

1343
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,720
I got bullied and I wasn't big.
I was a small kid and I was really

1344
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:06,840
nervous and I did not like that feeling
at all.

1345
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,651
And I,
I was always,

1346
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,920
we were always moving around a lot.
We was moved to new places.

1347
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,740
I was always the new kid.
No,

1348
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,471
my,
my,

1349
00:58:13,471 --> 00:58:18,471
my mom married my Stepdad.
We moved across the country from New

1350
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,090
Jersey to San Francisco and then we
lived there for a while and then we

1351
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:23,340
moved to Florida and then we moved to
Boston and he,

1352
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,940
he switched careers and he was a
computer programmer and then we became

1353
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:28,720
an architect.
And so there's a lot of work.

1354
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,220
Yeah,
there's a lot of traveling and I just

1355
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:35,730
was always the new kid in the new kid
gets fucked boys.

1356
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:37,530
Yeah.
And most of the time was fine,

1357
00:58:37,531 --> 00:58:41,160
but as we started getting older,
that's when it got creepy.

1358
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,290
Like most of the time it was no big
deal.

1359
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:47,040
Like at nine and 10 it's no big deal,
but when it gets to be like 13 and 14

1360
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:50,940
then it starts getting violent.
And so like kids would pick on me and I

1361
00:58:50,941 --> 00:58:53,460
didn't know how to fight.
And it drove me crazy.

1362
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,420
Like I was like,
God,

1363
00:58:54,421 --> 00:58:57,450
I fucking,
I hate the fact that when these kids

1364
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,400
want to fight me,
I don't know what to do and I'm,

1365
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:00,900
I'm terrified.
So I'd be like,

1366
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,360
go,
go home the long way around.

1367
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:05,040
So I'd avoid everybody and that kind of
shit.

1368
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,610
So I decided to learn martial arts.
I said,

1369
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,450
well,
what am I afraid of?

1370
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:10,680
I'm afraid of people that know how to
fight.

1371
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:12,930
Well I'll,
I'm going to really know how to fight.

1372
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,380
So I went into it.
Then it became my whole life,

1373
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,900
like from,
from high school,

1374
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:22,970
freshman year on really from 15 is when
I went crazy.

1375
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,600
So from 15 on a,
that's all I did every day,

1376
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,220
like six,
seven days a week.

1377
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:29,450
I was teaching,
I was,

1378
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:30,410
I,
I became a,

1379
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,230
I was in,
I was teaching when I was 17,

1380
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,060
I was a,
that's what I was doing.

1381
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:39,350
Like every day I was teaching at Boston
University when I was 18 and 19.

1382
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:41,720
And I was,
became my whole life.

1383
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,070
Born in Boston.
No,

1384
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:44,750
I was born in New Jersey.
I come,

1385
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,550
you don't have the crazy accident.
Got Rid of it.

1386
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,000
Hurt myself on TV.
I won the bay state games.

1387
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:50,840
It was this big,
uh,

1388
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,650
like an Olympic festival,
whether they had all the Olympic sports

1389
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:56,990
and was,
taekwondo had not been in the Olympics

1390
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:58,820
yet,
but it was about to be,

1391
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:00,830
so they had it in the bay state games
and I won.

1392
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,710
So they interviewed me on TV and I
remember Tom,

1393
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,790
he was like very specifically say we
were working really hard.

1394
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,040
And I was like,
oh,

1395
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,960
I heard that accent.
It was so bad.

1396
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:13,790
I heard the video and I was like,
oh my God,

1397
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:17,750
what the Fuck is wrong with me?
Like I had taken on that accent out of

1398
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:20,400
insecurity because I'd only lived there
since I was 13.

1399
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,900
Right.
So from 13 to 19 and six years I

1400
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:26,460
developed a stupid accent.
I fall,

1401
01:00:26,461 --> 01:00:27,294
wanted to finish it.
Yeah.

1402
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,180
And then I realized I'd done it once so
I abandoned that.

1403
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:32,570
But it will come out a little bit if I
get drunk like every now and then some

1404
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,000
words because he didn't grow up in it.
Yeah,

1405
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,060
of course it's gross when you hear
another girl.

1406
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:44,610
In fact
it's just like,

1407
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:49,100
it's like too many Ar.
The ar thing that stretches out.

1408
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,960
Although the ice didn't speak like that.
No,

1409
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:56,420
I wish as beautiful.
I like that accent is pretty,

1410
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,450
there's something about the Boston
accent,

1411
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:03,350
it's just particularly gross,
so please don't worry about it.

1412
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:08,660
You are fighting.
And then your pile talked you into

1413
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:12,590
becoming my friend Steve Graham to my
friends ed shorter and Steve Graham,

1414
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,450
Steve Graham,
still one of my best friends today.

1415
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:19,700
He was an ophthalmologist at the time
and still encourage you to walk.

1416
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:24,470
Go to you told me I should be a comedian
of class or like literally grabbed me by

1417
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:26,580
my shoulders and said you should be a
comedian.

1418
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:28,880
So then what happened?
I went to an open mic night,

1419
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,700
I watched a amateurs try it.
And one of the good things about

1420
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:32,910
amateurs is,
uh,

1421
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,360
if you go to watch,
like most of them don't know what

1422
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:36,290
they're doing,
they're terrible.

1423
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,370
So I was like,
okay,

1424
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:39,560
well I can't be as,
you know,

1425
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,690
at least I'm not going to be the only
one who sucks.

1426
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,120
So like if,
if I go up and do that,

1427
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:45,650
I can do what they're doing.
They suck.

1428
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,510
I suck too,
but they suck.

1429
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:52,160
So it's not like you're going up and
Richard Pryor's on Richard,

1430
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:53,930
Jenny and all this,
you could take the competition.

1431
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,471
Well,
no,

1432
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:56,900
I felt like I wouldn't be the only one
who sucked.

1433
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,340
Like people who really suck inspire you
to do it because they'll,

1434
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:04,340
they lower the bar of expectations.
Cause like if I went up there and it was

1435
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:06,920
all these really amazing comedians and
then to me,

1436
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,551
I'd be like,
oh,

1437
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:08,450
I can't do this.
I said,

1438
01:02:08,451 --> 01:02:12,080
I'm fucking terrible at it because the
learning curve of standup comedy is so

1439
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:15,080
long.
And especially when you're 21 you don't

1440
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,480
know shit.
I didn't know anything about life or

1441
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:18,200
anything.
Well,

1442
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,440
of course he didn't.
Exactly.

1443
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,050
Yeah.
So I

1444
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,930
was terrible.
But somehow or another,

1445
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,110
these guys talked me into doing it.
So do you still do your stand up?

1446
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:25,891
Yeah.
Constantly.

1447
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:26,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

1448
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,690
That's great.
Yeah.

1449
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,440
You turn it around on me.
Sure.

1450
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:32,480
Unless you're dead.
Yeah,

1451
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,400
he does.
Clever girl

1452
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:39,970
didn't know about that.
At worst you don't,

1453
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,520
you don't think you're clever?
I don't think particularly clever.

1454
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,360
I can think fast on my feet that makes
clever.

1455
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:51,720
But I have serious attention deficit
disorder.

1456
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:52,800
Yeah.
See,

1457
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,420
I hear that a lot from people.
I usually think that what that means is

1458
01:02:57,421 --> 01:03:02,040
you really enjoy certain things so much
that other things suck for you and you

1459
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:04,320
just get distracted.
I bet.

1460
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,020
I bet you don't have an attention
deficit disorder when you're singing

1461
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:07,770
your songs.
No,

1462
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:12,770
of course not.
But that again is not a material you'll

1463
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,150
have to retrieve.
It's just stuff in there.

1464
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:16,260
You open your mouth,
it comes out.

1465
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:19,230
Right.
But do you think that it's possible that

1466
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:24,231
you achieve these high frequencies of
delight and of stimulation when you're

1467
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,920
performing and when you're,
I mean,

1468
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:31,740
you got to think that when you're
onstage,

1469
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,440
like what's the biggest crowd you've
ever performed for this?

1470
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:36,190
Sounds like I'm making up.
I don't,

1471
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,380
I can hardly believe it,
but we played in front of 300,000 people

1472
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,890
in some out of Russia and that was the
trippiest expedia

1473
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,260
at the time.
It was the biggest music festival that

1474
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:52,350
I'd ever been
like,

1475
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:57,000
you couldn't see the end of the crowd.
Now I look at Glastonbury and go small.

1476
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:03,210
You know how it goes.
So think of that.

1477
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,870
Think of that experience and how many
people are ever going to feel that.

1478
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,840
How many ever people,
people are ever going to rock out in

1479
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:14,841
front of 300,000 people?
So I think that some people,

1480
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,780
they're the,
the moments of brilliance that there's

1481
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:23,781
moments of spectacular experience that
they have are so different than most

1482
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:29,331
people's lives.
Most people disagree 100% because I know

1483
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:36,621
that people's capacity for joy,
that it's a certain expedience that we

1484
01:04:36,991 --> 01:04:39,330
all have.
Like I can go out to dinner and if

1485
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:42,360
you're having a really great meal and
you're with people that you love and are

1486
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,940
really,
and you are laughing yourself sick.

1487
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,320
I have the same feelings as I do when
I'm having a good shore.

1488
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,980
I don't think it like,
it's not like my career is the highlight

1489
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:53,814
of my life.
It's,

1490
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,190
it's a joyous part of my life that plays
a rule in,

1491
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,950
in my enjoyment of being on earth.
That sounds very balanced,

1492
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,950
but I'm,
I'm not saying that doesn't.

1493
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,240
So I think my point being is the,
I just think if you enjoy your job,

1494
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:12,480
if you love your wife,
if you have great sex with your

1495
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:15,180
boyfriend or your girlfriend,
if you have a baby,

1496
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:17,470
you know that moment when they put the
baby in arms,

1497
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:18,160
you know exactly

1498
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,560
what it's like to play in front of
300,000 people,

1499
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:21,660
you know?
No,

1500
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,680
I don't think that's correct.
That is correct.

1501
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:25,150
You're the only one to be able to tell
us though.

1502
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm telling you,
you must take it from an authority.

1503
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,430
There's no denier.
You argue with,

1504
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,530
again,
what I was going to say though is that

1505
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:40,531
your experience in the intensity is so
high that your capacity to appreciate

1506
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:45,400
boring shit is probably very low and
that's one of the reasons why people

1507
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:47,980
would lay label it.
Like attention deficit.

1508
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:50,400
You probably just don't want to pay
attention to shit that,

1509
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:52,240
that you're not passionate about was the
case.

1510
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:55,930
But there is moments when somebody is
telling me something and I'm thinking to

1511
01:05:55,931 --> 01:05:56,381
myself,
okay,

1512
01:05:56,381 --> 01:06:00,070
remember this cause this is important
and or this is really cool.

1513
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:03,190
You could use it all the time.
I'm going to hold us information,

1514
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,290
hold this fact,
hold this.

1515
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,290
And then I try and tell somebody 24
hours later,

1516
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:11,410
but this incredible story I was told and
I can't remember it.

1517
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,700
That's called being a person.
Insane.

1518
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,440
Yeah,
but you haven't slipped away at all

1519
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,040
during this conversation.
No,

1520
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,860
I'm intense.
You've been locked on.

1521
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:23,850
I'm intense and I am a week.
You are or what you're woke.

1522
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,160
I hear that.
And fucking expression.

1523
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:33,070
One more time.
I might hit the next person might that

1524
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:33,670
comes like,
oh,

1525
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,220
that is an expression that never had its
day.

1526
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,540
Oh
yes.

1527
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,970
Joke from the moment I first came out
with fools.

1528
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,360
Fools.
No,

1529
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,600
no,
like person that I know.

1530
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:53,000
Like ever said that word without being
in just joking.

1531
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,790
No.
Well hang out with a lot of comedians.

1532
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:00,790
Well they're fast and quick and funny.
They think it's ridiculous job as a

1533
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:03,460
comedian to take the piss out of all us.
Norm norms.

1534
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,590
That is one thing that I love that you
guys say.

1535
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:08,650
Take the piss.
That is a great expression.

1536
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:13,690
Scotland has some incredible like
incredible expressions and sort of the

1537
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,560
most,
one of the best things that happened to

1538
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:20,770
me lately was I got retweeted by William
Gibson

1539
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:27,330
and he retweeted a Scottish,
a link that I'd done on,

1540
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:31,650
or I'd done for the nme on Scottish
Sweden and the fact that he had re

1541
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:36,010
posted my tutorial on Scottish sweating
and need my fucking life.

1542
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:39,640
Call me side if you want.
But it was like the most glorious moment

1543
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:41,590
of my career.
That's what I've sat at all.

1544
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:43,230
There's nothing,
but yeah,

1545
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,580
the scots are really funny.
You know,

1546
01:07:45,581 --> 01:07:48,640
it's a small culture because it's bad
weather.

1547
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:53,641
I mean these are stupefying uh,
so cliches I'm spewing here,

1548
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:56,740
but because it's a small country,
because it's bad weather because we

1549
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:59,020
spend a lot of time talking to one
another,

1550
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:03,760
passing one another in the street.
There's a lot of humor in America I find

1551
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:06,640
is not quite as acute.
You know,

1552
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:09,410
people are used to verbally spotting in
Scotland because you know,

1553
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,400
against people all the time,
pushing past them in shops,

1554
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:13,960
you know,
traveling and the tube,

1555
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:14,980
being on the bus,
blah,

1556
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:15,321
blah,
blah,

1557
01:08:15,321 --> 01:08:16,220
blah.
Whereas in America,

1558
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:19,250
everything's more spread out and you're
not around people so much.

1559
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:21,170
So when you are in face to face with
them,

1560
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:22,250
people are a little more polite.

1561
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:26,120
And Scotland,
there is absolutely no politeness.

1562
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:28,520
We got shoved their big comedy festival
there every year.

1563
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:29,980
The fridge.
Yeah.

1564
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,880
Have you been there yet
to Ari?

1565
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,320
Shaffir raves about it,
but that mother fucker goes everywhere.

1566
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:37,910
He's crazy.
You should go there.

1567
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:41,930
It's incredible.
It's an incredible circuit for funny men

1568
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:43,880
like yourself.
You guys have billy connolly,

1569
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:47,480
he's hilarious.
He kept calling me is great and hi

1570
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:48,420
ladies.
Hi.

1571
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:49,283
Hilarious.
Yeah.

1572
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:54,290
Well not well though.
Really decide degenerative disease,

1573
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:56,030
sadly.
Oh No.

1574
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,070
What is it?
We're going to lose him soon I think.

1575
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:00,570
Really?
What is it?

1576
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:05,650
I think it's target
or or dementia.

1577
01:09:05,781 --> 01:09:08,170
I can't remember if it's one on one of
the two.

1578
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,280
Anyway,
he's a brilliant mind.

1579
01:09:10,281 --> 01:09:11,114
Funny,
funny man.

1580
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,000
But uh,
you should get your ass over there.

1581
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:16,400
They would love you done bad weather
thing.

1582
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,890
I think that's why Boston has so many
funny comedians.

1583
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:20,900
I'm sure it does.
I'm serious.

1584
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:22,850
I'm not,
I mean it is a ridiculous cliche,

1585
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:26,540
but for sure it plays a small part and
it's not cliche at all.

1586
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:28,190
100%.
Yeah.

1587
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,630
I mean they've been Boston,
the same thing.

1588
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,230
A lot of bad weather,
a lot of cold snow people indoors,

1589
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,630
people the long winters.
I guess that's true.

1590
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:39,110
No tolerance for stupid shit.
No tolerance.

1591
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,300
Also work ethic,
like hard work ethic.

1592
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:45,230
They're very hard.
You had no tolerance for meandering

1593
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:46,600
bullshit.
No,

1594
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,980
it's very different.
It's a different way of thinking

1595
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:52,550
certainly than Los Angeles and my
expedience or soft out here,

1596
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,880
push heart are very polite and they are
soft for one of a better term.

1597
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,990
It's like I find that sometimes when I
make jokes people don't know how to flip

1598
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:04,940
it back.
You know like it's going to be buddies

1599
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:08,480
joking all the time and it's really fast
sort of dialogue.

1600
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,930
People panic,
panic and they,

1601
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:15,470
they're scared they're going to offend
you and say the wrong thing and

1602
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:20,060
sometimes I have to go on double dates
with my wife and sometimes I'll crack a

1603
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:22,880
joke and the whole table would be like,
what?

1604
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:24,460
Yeah,
that's meeting.

1605
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:28,010
I think all of us go home in the car.
I'll say to my husband,

1606
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:32,090
I'm really sorry if I embarrassed you.
And he says he's always got this

1607
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:33,740
classic.
He went and he didn't embarrass me.

1608
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,760
You only embarrass yourself
serious or joking?

1609
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,950
Kind of half and half.
I mean it's definitely,

1610
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:43,760
we both know when I've said something
mildly inappropriate.

1611
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,930
Do you feel like you're like because
you're from Scotland that you have like

1612
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:49,730
to temper that all the time?
I do.

1613
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:52,070
Try and temper it a lot,
but sometimes I forget,

1614
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:54,500
you know,
and then there's the crickets.

1615
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:56,650
Oh my God,
I'm might,

1616
01:10:56,650 --> 01:11:00,050
my poor husband who's fairly,
very assertive,

1617
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:03,710
quiet,
like he's very quiet and he thinks a lot

1618
01:11:03,711 --> 01:11:05,330
before he speaks.
And,

1619
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,210
uh,
I can just see him in his mind and he

1620
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:11,030
loves me and he doesn't,
it doesn't bother him until he did.

1621
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:13,260
He doesn't get embarrassed,
but he to,

1622
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,060
hey,
you can see them guard thing,

1623
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:15,841
his loins,
you know,

1624
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:19,890
like God,
did she just say that was a good thing

1625
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:20,550
as lawyers

1626
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,200
dig as lawyers guard.
Dang.

1627
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,130
I didn't even know what that means.
Gert thing.

1628
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,700
What does curtin good clip bitch.

1629
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,430
I think he,
the first person on this podcast ever

1630
01:11:33,431 --> 01:11:35,480
say to me,
oh,

1631
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,860
that's hilarious.
Good thing.

1632
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,750
How do you spell it?
Gerd.

1633
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:43,210
Gerd.
G.

1634
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:43,210
I.
R.

1635
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:43,210
D.
I.

1636
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:43,210
N.
G.

1637
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:43,991
Jimmy.
You never heard that before?

1638
01:11:43,991 --> 01:11:45,370
Have you?
As the first time,

1639
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:49,240
I'm all my years.
I've heard girding girding your loins.

1640
01:11:49,241 --> 01:11:51,550
I would imagine be clenching.
Yes.

1641
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,790
Yes.
I just context put it together.

1642
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:58,230
Occurred here you go and circle a with a
belt or a band.

1643
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,840
The young woman,
a young man was a,

1644
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,400
wants to be girded with a belt of
knighthood.

1645
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,293
Oh,
okay.

1646
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:07,200
Make Your Cup Scottish.
Hmm.

1647
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,190
What makes sense?
Girding you're talking about

1648
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:12,610
constricting.
Girding gird your loins,

1649
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:24,670
get ready or gear up
your loins.

1650
01:12:24,671 --> 01:12:25,600
Wow,
that's a good one.

1651
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:27,580
I'm here learning on this show.
This is a,

1652
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:28,803
this is a show of it.

1653
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,520
There's plenty more where that goes.
So are you fired up about this tour?

1654
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:37,960
You excited about this?
Of course.

1655
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:38,920
Yeah.
My God.

1656
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:39,610
Yeah.
I love,

1657
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:40,540
I love playing.
I mean,

1658
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:44,520
I'm sure that as a certain kind of high
you get when you go off in the road and

1659
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,310
you can stop worrying about bills.
You stop worrying about money,

1660
01:12:48,311 --> 01:12:49,600
stop worrying about,
you know,

1661
01:12:49,601 --> 01:12:50,860
the pain in your ankle.
You,

1662
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,360
you know,
you just have no worries.

1663
01:12:52,361 --> 01:12:55,780
You just go on the tour bus and you get
bust for me to be,

1664
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,190
you get a little email every day that
tells you exactly what you're doing.

1665
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,470
You know,
at noon to a core manager,

1666
01:13:02,471 --> 01:13:04,810
there's the handles all your manager.
Yes.

1667
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,180
Oh that's nice.
Yes.

1668
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,450
So,
um,

1669
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:12,430
I love going on tour and it's an honor
to be playing with blondie and uh,

1670
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:13,930
the fans are very excited.

1671
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:17,530
And how many days do you go for it?
I think it's about seven weeks,

1672
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,440
although,
which is a small tutor for us.

1673
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:22,810
That was a long time.
We normally go out for a year.

1674
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,850
A year.
A year,

1675
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:25,670
yeah.
One off,

1676
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,100
you know,
I mean you come home for bits,

1677
01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:29,530
but generally it's a sort of a year long
thing.

1678
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:32,770
And it used to be two years,
but then the music industry got crushed

1679
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,480
by music.
Final shading.

1680
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,090
Yes.
So it's a slightly different game

1681
01:13:37,091 --> 01:13:40,540
though.
But isn't the touring business the same

1682
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:42,940
or how does that work?
Well,

1683
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,370
yes and no.
I mean the problem with a tutoring

1684
01:13:45,371 --> 01:13:48,370
business know is that it's the only way
a musician can make money.

1685
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,061
Right.
So no,

1686
01:13:49,061 --> 01:13:54,061
the competition to score venues in which
you can play or it's getting higher and

1687
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:57,220
higher and higher.
So I noticed that as a community really

1688
01:13:57,221 --> 01:14:00,580
difficult is a huge issue.
Like I have to book stuff like a year in

1689
01:14:00,581 --> 01:14:01,590
advance advance.
Yeah.

1690
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,790
Yeah.
Edinburgh festival next year.

1691
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:06,640
Come on,
you'll love it.

1692
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:11,470
You'll learn all kinds of phrases that
you can employ in your stand up and ever

1693
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:14,140
used in America.
Lots of original material.

1694
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:15,123
Hmm.

1695
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:20,380
Hmm.
So you guys though,

1696
01:14:20,381 --> 01:14:25,381
you were in the business when the money
was being made and then it was like,

1697
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:29,110
what is it around like 2000 when the
floor dropped out,

1698
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:33,490
the floor was beginning to drill pipe
and then 2001 came around and September,

1699
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,830
September.
That was,

1700
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:37,300
yeah,
that was the beginning of the end.

1701
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,130
Yeah.
Did you see the writing on the wall?

1702
01:14:39,131 --> 01:14:40,210
Did you think they were going to be able
to,

1703
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:42,910
I told her whole,
I totally saw the writing on the wall.

1704
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,400
Actually rule a boater.
I at the time I run our blog,

1705
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:46,630
a music blog,
which was,

1706
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,040
you know,
one of the first,

1707
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,680
back then,
because musicians didn't have blogs,

1708
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:52,960
we didn't really use computers up to
that point.

1709
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:56,640
So I had this blog and I was very vocal
about napster and I,

1710
01:14:56,641 --> 01:14:57,610
uh,
I was,

1711
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,340
I could foresee the issues that,
you know,

1712
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:03,550
that presented themselves,
but the industry itself was still

1713
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:03,940
greedy.

1714
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,090
It refused to adapt.
You know,

1715
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:11,320
and as long as he could have died,
I don't know.

1716
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:13,390
That's not my place to,
what about it really?

1717
01:15:13,391 --> 01:15:14,570
But,
um,

1718
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:19,950
they just continued to want to make
money via cds and physical seals and the

1719
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,590
refused sort of to make the kind of
deals that they really needed to,

1720
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:25,200
and digital deals.
Yeah.

1721
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:29,500
While before people started selling
things on itunes and what have you,

1722
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:32,590
but there wasn't really a,
a venue for it before that they would

1723
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:34,270
have had to create,
like they would have had to create it,

1724
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:36,160
but the real,
the only ones who had the power and the

1725
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:38,640
financial resources to do so,
you know,

1726
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:39,520
so,
and,

1727
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,010
and as a result,
now of course they're the only ones we

1728
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:45,490
can money or any of the companies,
the record companies continue to make

1729
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:49,840
vast amounts of money off artists,
youtube mix vast amounts of money off

1730
01:15:49,841 --> 01:15:50,230
artists.

1731
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:52,570
And the artist makes nothing.
I don't think the general public are

1732
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:56,260
fully aware of what a crime spree is.
Crime,

1733
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:59,080
crime spree.
It's a crime spree.

1734
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,020
But who's,
who's committing the crimes while

1735
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:04,970
they're tiny crimes committed against
each artist,

1736
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,280
that,
that con that compiles a vast library of

1737
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:14,281
digital content that through which
massive companies conglomerates make

1738
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:18,920
money from by just sheer mass.
But the artists themselves mixed,

1739
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,750
you know,
less than a penny a pop less than a

1740
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,620
penny a pop,
you know.

1741
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:27,310
So I'll give you guys like,
I bought your albums on itunes.

1742
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:31,600
Well we had a bad example too because we
are our own record label at this point.

1743
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,240
You are your own records.
So when a bad example,

1744
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:39,241
we're one of the lucky ones and when did
you figure this out by a lot of getting

1745
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,301
fucked up.
They are.

1746
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:43,360
So you know,
no lube was used and you know,

1747
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:43,971
yeah,
we,

1748
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:44,710
we,
we are,

1749
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:47,860
we were around long enough that at some
of our masters are very good to us and

1750
01:16:47,861 --> 01:16:52,630
so we could make really lucrative deals
for ourselves and protect our catalog

1751
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:53,351
and you know,
it's blah,

1752
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:53,710
blah blah.

1753
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,800
It's so boring.
But boring is fascinating for young

1754
01:16:56,801 --> 01:16:58,240
artists.
I don't know,

1755
01:16:58,241 --> 01:16:59,410
I despair.
It's like,

1756
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:00,010
you know,
you're,

1757
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:03,190
you're hooked up to a record label.
The record label makes money by your

1758
01:17:03,191 --> 01:17:05,440
records getting plead on Youtube for an
example.

1759
01:17:05,441 --> 01:17:06,970
You don't,
not really,

1760
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I mean it's like a 0.0375 percentage of
a penny that you might get played after

1761
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:19,870
by a thousand million plays on youtube.
I mean this,

1762
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:22,670
it's bizarre,
but you know,

1763
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,100
it's,
it is,

1764
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,260
what is the justification for a record
company at this point?

1765
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:30,400
It seems like what with distribution?
Yeah,

1766
01:17:30,401 --> 01:17:33,500
but like where are they distributing at
told one of the world,

1767
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:36,110
but to where to what and in what,
in what manner?

1768
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,940
In a variety of different manners.
I mean they know do three 60 degrees,

1769
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:42,640
so they take a percentage of absolutely
everything.

1770
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:43,880
A band,
errands,

1771
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:45,860
which was not the case before.
Generally speaking,

1772
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:46,170
the knife.

1773
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:48,710
So up your publishing,
they saw up your performance rates,

1774
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:51,890
they saw what your marriage,
they s any endorsements you get,

1775
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,740
you know,
that seems fucked up to me.

1776
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,010
It is fucked up.
Doesn't,

1777
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,170
it doesn't seem like it's worth it.
Like what do they,

1778
01:17:57,171 --> 01:18:00,680
what do they bring to the table?
Just a bunch of people stealing money,

1779
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:03,150
except if you're a massive pop star like
you know,

1780
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:06,620
beyond Sierra Gaga or Kate Patty and a
bieber or what have you,

1781
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,920
then that company can use its resources
to make you even bigger.

1782
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:15,890
And that's why these,
these pop stars who continue to make

1783
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,370
commercial signed music get bigger and
bigger and bigger and more and more

1784
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:24,290
powerful until they can just buy their
way into the consciousness of the public

1785
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:27,770
culture.
But radio is not much of a thing

1786
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:28,190
anymore.
No,

1787
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:28,430
no,
no.

1788
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,710
It's not radio anymore.
But it's visibility.

1789
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:33,360
You have to have visibility.
So what is it that's getting

1790
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,580
people visible these days?
Like,

1791
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:39,960
like it used to be a song would be a top
40 hit on the radio and then everybody

1792
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:41,880
would hear about it and you'd want to go
out and buy the record.

1793
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,990
Well I think most young people get it on
the web,

1794
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:46,270
right?

1795
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:48,640
But like how does,
but viral music,

1796
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:52,270
like if you release a song and you're
with your label,

1797
01:18:52,271 --> 01:18:55,990
it's your own thing and you put it on
youtube and say someone like me comes

1798
01:18:55,991 --> 01:18:58,270
along and has a lot of twitter followers
and I say,

1799
01:18:58,271 --> 01:19:00,950
this is awesome and I retweet it.
And then a bunch of other people retweet

1800
01:19:00,951 --> 01:19:02,350
it.
That's all it takes today,

1801
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,420
right?

1802
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,860
Yes and no.
I mean,

1803
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:07,320
you have to have a song though that's
easily digestible,

1804
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:11,430
which is why there's so few musicians
now taking real risks because otherwise

1805
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:15,570
if they take a risk,
they don't have a all song,

1806
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,820
you know,
that appeals to the masses then.

1807
01:19:17,821 --> 01:19:20,060
So you day.
But I'll see what I mean.

1808
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,930
I mean,
I'm not articulating myself anywhere.

1809
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,750
Kendrick Lamar guy is that guy,
is he independent?

1810
01:19:24,751 --> 01:19:27,360
Is he the guy that's independent,
which got chance the rapper chance the

1811
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:29,460
rapper.
He's the guy that's independent and he's

1812
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,720
enormous,
right?

1813
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,060
Yes.
So how the fuck did he do it?

1814
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,680
Well,
there's obviously the always an

1815
01:19:34,681 --> 01:19:36,870
exception to the rule and he's
extraordinary.

1816
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:38,520
You know,
he's an extraordinary talent.

1817
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,910
And,
and usually when somebody hasn't reached

1818
01:19:41,911 --> 01:19:45,150
public consciousness yet,
there's a lot of hype around them.

1819
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,580
You know,
people want to be in the know,

1820
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,610
they want to talk about the new artists
that everybody doesn't know about so and

1821
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:53,160
so forth.
So they enjoy like a massive swell

1822
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,630
and hopefully he'll be able to build
upon that.

1823
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:59,280
But it'll be harder for him the next
time round.

1824
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:02,250
What I'm getting at is,
it is fascinating to me that the record

1825
01:20:02,251 --> 01:20:06,250
companies have managed to stay even
remotely relevant because what,

1826
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:08,070
because they made all these deals with
all

1827
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:11,910
these new companies,
but that's the media companies.

1828
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,380
That's where it gets really creepy.
Right?

1829
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,300
I think it's creepy.
It is creepy.

1830
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:16,830
It is creepy.
As someone who's not in the business,

1831
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:20,250
it's creepy because I'm looking at like
what they bring to the table and there's

1832
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:22,230
not a lot,
as I said,

1833
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:25,830
distribution and if you don't,
I know this firsthand because it's very

1834
01:20:25,831 --> 01:20:29,580
difficult for us to get to distribute
our music because we don't have a

1835
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:32,880
distribution label that can compete.
Right.

1836
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:35,160
But when you say distribution,
like distributed,

1837
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:40,110
where at are whenever they can.
So whether that's adds on the street,

1838
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,340
whether that's ads on the television,
whether it's ads on the radio,

1839
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:46,680
whether it's ads on youtube and so on,
so forth.

1840
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:50,160
It's just an accumulative con like
awareness of an artist.

1841
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:55,190
So they're almost manufacturing like
public interest kind of.

1842
01:20:55,591 --> 01:20:57,070
Yeah.
I mean they,

1843
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:00,210
they have to have assemblance of
something good,

1844
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:00,841
you know,
they can't,

1845
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:03,450
you can't,
you can sell shit as it turns out.

1846
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,160
But that's again,
the exception to the rule.

1847
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,580
Generally speaking,
they'll have a catchy song and they can,

1848
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:13,581
if they push it to enough minds eyes,
they can have a hip.

1849
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:16,260
Wow.
What a weird transition.

1850
01:21:16,261 --> 01:21:19,410
They're like vampires.
They figured out how to remain indoors.

1851
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,800
Yeah.
This fifth a strange and is kind of sad

1852
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:27,150
really as it,
that's why you are seeing fewer and

1853
01:21:27,151 --> 01:21:30,870
fewer artists that have long careers
because like I said,

1854
01:21:30,871 --> 01:21:33,480
you can generate a lot of excitement
when it's your first record.

1855
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,810
That's sort of the point.
It's easiest when by the time it comes

1856
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:39,060
to your second record.
A lot of these artists that we hear

1857
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:43,560
about are already dead and buried under
1,000,000,001 other new artists.

1858
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,190
Yeah,
I'm sure you read that Courtney love

1859
01:21:47,191 --> 01:21:50,250
article that she wrote many,
many years ago about the music business,

1860
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:53,850
about how complicated it is,
and this is pre all of this digital

1861
01:21:53,851 --> 01:21:54,450
stuff.

1862
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:58,650
She wrote this way back in the day when
she was explaining how these artists get

1863
01:21:58,651 --> 01:22:03,651
fucked over by music companies about how
everything gets written off as an

1864
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:06,720
expense.
So by the time they get paid,

1865
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,880
everybody else has been paid.
Everybody else is like the,

1866
01:22:09,881 --> 01:22:12,810
the record companies made money,
the executives of big money and then the

1867
01:22:12,811 --> 01:22:17,580
artists get money and all the expenses
get written off as expenses that the

1868
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:20,010
artists have to pay for.
But you have no control over the

1869
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:22,410
expanding.
So for a random example,

1870
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:26,790
you can turn up at an airport,
you flew in from La to London.

1871
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:30,810
You arrive and there's a limousine
waiting for you and you don't even

1872
01:22:30,811 --> 01:22:31,650
question it.
You're like,

1873
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,810
oh,
this is the transport,

1874
01:22:32,811 --> 01:22:36,400
the record company of scent.
They take you to this ridiculous hotel

1875
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,340
that the posture than you've ever been
in your life.

1876
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,470
You don't think about it because the
record companies paying for it,

1877
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,530
they throw a huge big party.
Wow.

1878
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:45,420
How generous our record companies.
So amazing.

1879
01:22:45,421 --> 01:22:47,160
Well,
look at this incredible party and then

1880
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,630
charging you for every single thing.
And yet none of it gets run through you

1881
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:54,900
for your approval.
So you have no power over the economic

1882
01:22:54,901 --> 01:22:56,670
spending,
but you get charged back.

1883
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,860
Absolutely.
Every single expenditure.

1884
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,830
Not only that,
the salaries of the people that run

1885
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:04,440
these companies,
all of that is dependent upon you

1886
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:05,740
selling your art.
That's right.

1887
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:06,040
And

1888
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,480
when things are going well,
everyone's,

1889
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:09,640
they're going well,
then we do an amazing job.

1890
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,840
You know,
worship me.

1891
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,040
You're going to literally everyone in
the record companies like you owe us a

1892
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:16,510
thank you and aren't we amazing?
And then we talk to,

1893
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:17,490
you know,
be the,

1894
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,910
it's an inference.
Like,

1895
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:19,883
yeah,
I did that.

1896
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:21,450
We did this look,
oh,

1897
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,530
what a great job we did for you and your
band.

1898
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:24,250
And you're like,
yeah,

1899
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,390
great.
Thank you so much.

1900
01:23:25,391 --> 01:23:28,720
So it's wonderful.
And then the second something goes wrong

1901
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,940
is you're on your own.
You guys need to figure this out.

1902
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,950
We're just your record label.
We can't,

1903
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:34,960
you know what I mean?
It's just like,

1904
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:35,883
it's,
it's,

1905
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,650
it's difficult to deal with,
uh,

1906
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,070
first,
but then you get used to it.

1907
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,600
Now,
in the early days,

1908
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,970
did they take a piece of your tour?
No.

1909
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,650
No,
they never have with us,

1910
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:47,620
but they do know with young bands,
this is called a three 60 deal where

1911
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:48,980
they take how much they take.

1912
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:51,880
I don't know.
It's different for every band.

1913
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,610
Every single band has to negotiate.
So instance,

1914
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:57,700
you know what's a normal,
absolutely.

1915
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,110
One day,
15,

1916
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:00,430
20%,
20%.

1917
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,830
So they would take 20% of all your
touring.

1918
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,590
So they would be like,
if you on Chimera,

1919
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,820
Bam,
they'd be like the fifth person in the

1920
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:07,654
band.
Correct.

1921
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:11,080
Boy,
the merge your fucking tee shirts.

1922
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,490
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1923
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:17,020
They take everything.
It's pretty weird and pretty grim right

1924
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:19,090
now.
If this is what's weird is like what are

1925
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:20,830
the,
I don't understand what they're doing.

1926
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,210
Well,
I don't think they do either.

1927
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:23,440
I think,
I think to be honest,

1928
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:27,970
they're still trying to figure out what
their rule can be in this new world.

1929
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,800
You know,
it's difficult for them.

1930
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,280
Wow.
Wow.

1931
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,793
Life is tough.

1932
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,560
It's a fascinating time because this
digital thing that came along,

1933
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,630
what's really interesting is that,
you know,

1934
01:24:42,631 --> 01:24:45,780
we saw when the economy fell apart,
right?

1935
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:50,781
We saw banks getting bailed out and we
saw these music companies going under.

1936
01:24:52,081 --> 01:24:57,081
We saw like a lot of issues,
a lot of collapses and it's all because

1937
01:24:57,331 --> 01:25:02,130
of these emerging technologies.
But these emerging technologies also on

1938
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:04,350
the flip side,
make it so much easier for people to

1939
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:05,230
find out about it.
Yeah.

1940
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,850
Yes.
And it slowly,

1941
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,820
I think things will,
I think it will balance itself out

1942
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:10,840
again.
Right?

1943
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:14,290
I think younger artists are going to get
we smarter than we ever were and just

1944
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:14,981
go,
hold on a minute.

1945
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:17,140
We're not signing these rates.
Do you have to?

1946
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,030
Because there's no reason for that
today.

1947
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:21,460
It just doesn't make it.
That's what it's so confusing to me.

1948
01:25:21,461 --> 01:25:25,930
Like giving away your merge and you're
touring like unless they're booking the

1949
01:25:25,931 --> 01:25:27,770
tour for you,
unless they're acting.

1950
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,460
See though,
how the fuck are they getting a piece?

1951
01:25:30,461 --> 01:25:32,200
That's what I'm saying.
The one that's me.

1952
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:35,680
That's where an agent gets a piece
because they book it,

1953
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:36,950
they set it up.
They,

1954
01:25:36,951 --> 01:25:39,340
they arranged the publicity.
They do all that.

1955
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:40,780
Like they,
they deserve a piece.

1956
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:43,120
Like that's a business deal.
Like did seems like they're just

1957
01:25:43,121 --> 01:25:45,730
stealing money.
Well it seems a little bit like that.

1958
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:46,820
I would agree.
I mean what's,

1959
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,280
what was like for,
for instance,

1960
01:25:49,281 --> 01:25:53,950
in the art business,
we make 10% of everything we earn.

1961
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:58,630
So that's basically,
we know that what we can make a certain

1962
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:01,420
amount of money and by the time we've
paid everybody,

1963
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,010
we'll take 10% home for all

1964
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,020
the band members.
Each band member gets 10% so 40% okay.

1965
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,880
40% of what we make,
and this is not even taxes.

1966
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:12,560
You're not even talking about todd
talking about tax,

1967
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:14,520
but it's time.
The decimate it put,

1968
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:16,160
you know,
you were decimated.

1969
01:26:16,161 --> 01:26:21,161
But we are one of the bands who don't
have to pay a percentage of our tooting

1970
01:26:21,651 --> 01:26:23,270
and our marriage.
And we're one of the bands who get a

1971
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:25,570
very high,
um,

1972
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:30,020
royalty on our records because we only,
we only give away a tiny,

1973
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:34,130
tiny percentage of every record to our
distribution company.

1974
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:36,590
So we're one of the lucky ones.
So we're always thinking,

1975
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,200
well,
if this is how it is for us,

1976
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,330
Oh,
I said,

1977
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:43,880
for all these other young artists,
there's a big thing about young artists,

1978
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:47,060
they have to pretend that they're rich.
So everybody has to drive around in a

1979
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:50,000
Ferrari,
you have to have a free hour watch on

1980
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:50,490
your wrist.

1981
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:53,750
You have to walk around like a baller.
I really reject all that and I think I

1982
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:57,740
advise everybody else to reject it too.
I think we're beginning to move towards

1983
01:26:57,741 --> 01:27:02,741
a new world order because the worshiping
of money we can sustain our lives and

1984
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:05,180
our world that we things are right now.
Well,

1985
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:08,960
it comes from people being poor and
wanting to aspire to be rich.

1986
01:27:08,961 --> 01:27:11,930
And then once you make it,
you have to sort of put that show on.

1987
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,230
Right?
I mean that's,

1988
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:15,110
but that's a huge thing in the rap
community,

1989
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:16,820
right?
With rappers,

1990
01:27:16,821 --> 01:27:19,490
it's almost mandatory.
It's a very rare that someone bucks the

1991
01:27:19,491 --> 01:27:22,370
trend where they're not wearing a lot of
jewelry and driving around a Bentley.

1992
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,480
Although I feel that,
again,

1993
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:24,960
that's changing too,
you know?

1994
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,353
But,
um,

1995
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:29,000
yeah,
I've never fallen in love with those

1996
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:34,001
kind of acts as far coats and limousines
and I dunno,

1997
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,240
it's just not my style.

1998
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:36,650
Yeah,
no,

1999
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:37,580
it's uh,
well,

2000
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:39,140
I mean it's,
it comes from,

2001
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:42,290
you know,
economically deprived people that

2002
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,740
finally break through.
And of course I understand it's always

2003
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:47,240
been,
but it's a,

2004
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:51,080
it's almost like the fun part of like
the rap business.

2005
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,940
Like a big part of the fun part.
I mean,

2006
01:27:52,941 --> 01:27:57,650
how many fucking rap songs are about
jewelry and diamonds and cars and

2007
01:27:57,651 --> 01:28:00,740
mansions.
And you'll see when I was growing up,

2008
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,270
as we were telling him about being the
same age earlier on,

2009
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:09,010
it was really uncool to talk about money
and all the cultural hurdles where we

2010
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,750
didn't have money and would never talk
about money.

2011
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:15,590
And actually often it was heartbreaking
when you've discovered they were rich

2012
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,220
because they were kind of our work in
men's huddles.

2013
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:19,410
You know,
I work in man heroes,

2014
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,840
go back to Kurt Cobain,
he wore like converse all stars and

2015
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,850
shipped up jeans and flannel shirts
farther back than that.

2016
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:26,540
You know,
like,

2017
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,420
um,
like John Lennon or somebody and they

2018
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:30,470
ran all these tests,
you know.

2019
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:34,400
But that's what I was sort of
indoctrinated in when I was growing up

2020
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:36,670
or which I'm actually,
it's grateful for it.

2021
01:28:36,671 --> 01:28:39,020
I don't,
I don't want to be somebody who worships

2022
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:39,680
money.
Well,

2023
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,840
it's a foolish thing to worship because
you know,

2024
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:45,410
the,
the ultimately like what an artist is

2025
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:50,411
doing is they're trying to express
themselves in the most unique way

2026
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:52,640
possible and connect with people,
right?

2027
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:54,770
You're supposed to,
you're just trying to show the world

2028
01:28:54,771 --> 01:28:57,440
through your eyes.
You're trying to express yourself and if

2029
01:28:57,441 --> 01:29:01,310
all you're trying to express is that you
want to stack checks,

2030
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,330
stack,
what is it?

2031
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,270
What do they call it?
Stack on deck when it,

2032
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,113
how?
What's that?

2033
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:09,510
Stacks on stacks on deck.
That's like a big thing.

2034
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,270
The wrappers,
those kids today talking about stacks,

2035
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,690
Stefan decks,
just to,

2036
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,560
just to have a little cushion.

2037
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:18,730
It's always nice to have a coupon.
Right?

2038
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,900
But I feel like these days are long
gone.

2039
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,730
It is crazy though,
that you guys only get 10% then you

2040
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:27,810
really stop and think about it all and
then you pay taxes on the 10% I don't

2041
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:29,040
think people understand that.
No,

2042
01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:31,680
I really don't think people understand
about the same time.

2043
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:34,080
Like nobody wants to hear a musician
wine.

2044
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:37,830
No,
but I know many people who live,

2045
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:41,520
who will have very modest jobs,
who are wealthier than we are at this

2046
01:29:41,521 --> 01:29:42,354
point,
you know?

2047
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:43,760
But you know,
that's,

2048
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,770
that's life.
I never became an artist because I want

2049
01:29:45,771 --> 01:29:48,710
it to be rich.
Well,

2050
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:53,750
you would be so much happier being who
you are then not being able to sing and

2051
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,650
being wealthy.
Exactly.

2052
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,990
Yeah.
And I also have met a lot of rich people

2053
01:29:57,991 --> 01:30:02,400
in my team and they're miserable.
So certainly can be chasing that very

2054
01:30:02,401 --> 01:30:03,150
isolated.

2055
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:07,020
And I know I could count on my hands.
They might have really rich people I

2056
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:11,220
know who live happy lives,
who seem like they know what to do with

2057
01:30:11,221 --> 01:30:13,470
their money and these people definitely
are out there.

2058
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:16,110
You know,
they have all the happy marriages,

2059
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:17,640
happy kids,
balanced kids,

2060
01:30:17,641 --> 01:30:19,530
you know,
they know when to have fun.

2061
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:20,820
They know how to work hard,
you know,

2062
01:30:20,821 --> 01:30:22,650
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
But they're the exception to the rule.

2063
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:25,680
Super Rare.
It's worth the pursuit is such a strange

2064
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:30,681
pursuit because you know,
oftentimes when you're pursuing wealth,

2065
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:34,920
you're pursuing wealth at all costs.
I mean that is the ultimate goal is the

2066
01:30:34,921 --> 01:30:38,790
score that you put on the board.
I mean that's the Gordon Gekko

2067
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:40,140
philosophy.
Greed is good.

2068
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,090
Greed will protect me.
I mean,

2069
01:30:42,091 --> 01:30:45,450
I understand it,
why people feel an,

2070
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:49,020
and they're not always wrong either.
Where money can protect you from a lot

2071
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:51,570
of presidencies go to our president.

2072
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:54,090
I mean our president is essentially,
the greed is good guy.

2073
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:57,030
I mean the he,
that is who he is.

2074
01:30:57,031 --> 01:30:58,560
I mean that's what he's done.
I mean,

2075
01:30:58,561 --> 01:31:02,460
he has pursued wealth at all costs,
but he was also born into wealth a

2076
01:31:02,461 --> 01:31:03,294
little bit.
Yeah.

2077
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:06,000
And then I think it was a little bit,
I think it was a substantial amount of

2078
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:07,530
money he inherited,
well,

2079
01:31:07,531 --> 01:31:10,200
he was given $2 million to start his
business,

2080
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,090
his first business.
And he talks about it,

2081
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:15,900
a small loan,
small loans to small loan of $2 million.

2082
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:16,281
Yeah,
yeah,

2083
01:31:16,281 --> 01:31:16,861
yeah,
yeah.

2084
01:31:16,861 --> 01:31:20,100
I mean it's,
he certainly has inherited quite a bit

2085
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:21,570
of it would no doubt,
no doubt about it.

2086
01:31:21,571 --> 01:31:25,050
But my point is that his philosophy and
like what he's always pursued his

2087
01:31:25,051 --> 01:31:28,140
extravagance,
like the big gold letters on the side of

2088
01:31:28,141 --> 01:31:30,150
the skyscrapers.
That's his thing.

2089
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,760
And it's a stain.
It's,

2090
01:31:32,761 --> 01:31:37,530
in a lot of ways it's a dangerous
ideology for our country to aspire to.

2091
01:31:37,531 --> 01:31:39,000
Oh,
because everybody can't,

2092
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:44,040
you can attend that.
So what use then seeing two people who

2093
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,900
have that,
who will never have that.

2094
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:48,780
That's kind of what leaves me in great
dismay.

2095
01:31:48,781 --> 01:31:52,620
I understand the pursuit of money and
economic wellbeing.

2096
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:56,850
But yeah,
I feel like what did we then see to the

2097
01:31:56,851 --> 01:31:59,020
people that don't have that and never
will have that,

2098
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,730
that has to be something

2099
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,460
else other than the worst,
right?

2100
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,470
Yeah.
It's a hollow pursuit.

2101
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,090
It's,
and it's a pursuit that's like,

2102
01:32:06,091 --> 01:32:08,570
it's not examined closely enough for
four.

2103
01:32:08,571 --> 01:32:11,250
It's hollow ness,
if that's a word.

2104
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,610
I was having a conversation once with
this friend of mine who is,

2105
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:16,980
uh,
is pretty radical black guy,

2106
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:22,280
a pretty radical African American and
just very proud of African American

2107
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:23,730
heritage.
And he,

2108
01:32:23,731 --> 01:32:26,490
uh,
he went on this thing about how black

2109
01:32:26,491 --> 01:32:28,200
people used to be kings.
He's like,

2110
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:30,030
we were kings.
Do you understand that?

2111
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:31,710
I go stop.
I go,

2112
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:35,340
can't everybody can't be a king because
I see if you have a bunch of kings,

2113
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,890
like to be a king has to be a dictator.
Okay.

2114
01:32:37,891 --> 01:32:40,680
That means you're dominating people who
aren't kings.

2115
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:43,350
That's not a proud thing.
Like you gotta stop saying that.

2116
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,770
Like you say it's the wrong thought
process,

2117
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:49,170
but it's the thought process is his in
his,

2118
01:32:49,171 --> 01:32:51,350
uh,
he had examined it like his in his idea,

2119
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,390
like at one point in time we were
Africans,

2120
01:32:54,391 --> 01:32:55,390
we were kings,
we were,

2121
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,330
we were on top and then,
you know,

2122
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:58,650
slavery and all this other stuff.

2123
01:32:58,890 --> 01:32:59,671
So his,
like,

2124
01:32:59,671 --> 01:33:03,540
his thought process was kind of
convoluted and by saying we were kings,

2125
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,670
I was like,
you don't want to be a fucking king man.

2126
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:09,330
Like nobody should be a fucking king.
Should be zero kings and you definitely

2127
01:33:09,331 --> 01:33:11,550
don't want to see,
we were kings like we can be kings

2128
01:33:11,551 --> 01:33:13,020
again,
like don't be a king.

2129
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:14,160
Yeah,
I don't want to be king.

2130
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,570
I don't want to be a queen.
Well,

2131
01:33:15,571 --> 01:33:18,690
it's a big thing with fighters.
Like some fighters call himself king,

2132
01:33:18,691 --> 01:33:21,270
this king that they like to part of
their name.

2133
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,250
You know,
it's a weird,

2134
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,300
it's only African American guys.
I don't know any white guys call himself

2135
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:27,811
king.
Oh,

2136
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:29,050
come on,
don't,

2137
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:30,510
oh,
platers white fighters.

2138
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,160
Oh,
you're talking about know about that

2139
01:33:32,161 --> 01:33:34,140
world with me.
Bobby King,

2140
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:35,870
Greene King Bobby Green,
King Mo.

2141
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,240
I know,
I know like five or six King Kevin

2142
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:39,620
Casey.

2143
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:44,510
When you feel that you're,
you're a disadvantage and us as society,

2144
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,510
you know,
words are powerful and they can,

2145
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,490
the words we tell ourselves are really
powerful and perhaps you can manifest a

2146
01:33:52,491 --> 01:33:55,760
power that you need.
Some times we all need it.

2147
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:58,190
Sometimes I know I need it myself.
You know,

2148
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:00,710
where you know,
you think to yourself,

2149
01:34:00,711 --> 01:34:02,690
okay,
you need to remember what you have done,

2150
01:34:02,691 --> 01:34:04,130
what you've accomplished,
who you are,

2151
01:34:04,131 --> 01:34:05,510
who your mother is.
You know,

2152
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,630
I think that there's a lot to be said,
I guess for sure,

2153
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:11,450
for the casual use of certain words.
But you're right.

2154
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:15,890
I mean it is,
as we continue to use these words,

2155
01:34:15,891 --> 01:34:17,120
we have to examine their meaning.

2156
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,183
Yeah.
I think I,

2157
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:20,650
I definitely think that's the case.
I think that the,

2158
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:24,550
the wealth at all costs is a,
a foolish pursuit that people look at

2159
01:34:24,551 --> 01:34:26,380
when they don't have the wealth.
I mean,

2160
01:34:26,381 --> 01:34:29,590
that's when it becomes an attractive
thing is the idea that,

2161
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:31,210
you know,
you just got to get that paper.

2162
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:31,710
Okay.

2163
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:34,140
When you've got the wealth.
I think the greediest people are the

2164
01:34:34,141 --> 01:34:35,790
people who are,
I've got shitloads of money.

2165
01:34:35,791 --> 01:34:40,530
That's why we see a lot of these,
these people with money wanting to cut

2166
01:34:40,531 --> 01:34:43,020
their,
have their tuxes cut rather than inject

2167
01:34:43,021 --> 01:34:44,880
some taxes into the community.
I mean,

2168
01:34:44,881 --> 01:34:49,881
I'd much rather live in a more pleasant
community then sit in my golden tower by

2169
01:34:50,371 --> 01:34:52,770
myself with like riots going on in the
street.

2170
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:56,300
You know what I mean?
I feel like if you make everybody happy

2171
01:34:56,301 --> 01:34:57,134
year,
yeah,

2172
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,400
you can still be rich,

2173
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:01,220
but you're going to have a nicer garden
to we'll cut into.

2174
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,440
That's a very good attitude.
It's a very good attitude.

2175
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:07,550
I think it's a weird game that people
play where it becomes just about getting

2176
01:35:07,551 --> 01:35:10,520
those points up on the board and they
become,

2177
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:13,010
the numbers become meaningless.
Like you don't sing.

2178
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,610
You don't think I have $30 million,
I can't spend this.

2179
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:18,830
This is if I live a normal life,
I'm good.

2180
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:21,260
They don't think that they think I need
50 million.

2181
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,820
I need an island.
I want a jet.

2182
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,110
How much is enough,
babe?

2183
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:26,000
You know,
how much is enough.

2184
01:35:26,001 --> 01:35:30,260
And of course the more you accumulate,
the more your expenses are and the more

2185
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:32,930
you want.
So it just goes on and on and on and on.

2186
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:36,200
There's an amazing radio lab podcast.
It's out now about,

2187
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:37,520
um,
Bernie madoff.

2188
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,990
Oh,
there's a show coming to narrows playing

2189
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:42,853
brain.

2190
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:45,890
She's still hot.
It's fuck gotta be 80,

2191
01:35:45,891 --> 01:35:49,100
90 years old now.
He is still so beautiful,

2192
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:50,510
so hot.
It's crazy.

2193
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:53,040
So I'm looking forward to that.
But sorry.

2194
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,690
No worries.
But it's just,

2195
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,580
um,
the,

2196
01:35:56,580 --> 01:36:00,050
the interview him and you get to hear
him talk and the,

2197
01:36:00,051 --> 01:36:02,870
um,
the reporter called him in jail and it's

2198
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:06,050
a really fascinating way they had their
communicate because they're only allowed

2199
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,960
to communicate for 15 minutes and then
they have to,

2200
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:11,720
the phone is disconnected and then they
have to wait 15 minutes for,

2201
01:36:11,721 --> 01:36:13,970
they can reconnect.
So he's doing this.

2202
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:16,070
Yeah.
That's just the rules of the prison.

2203
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:17,480
So they're doing it.
I mean,

2204
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:21,110
he's in there for it ever.
He's never getting out of that fucking

2205
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:22,490
cage.
Yeah.

2206
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:26,840
But it's fascinating when you hear him.
He has zero empathy.

2207
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,860
I mean,
none.

2208
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:31,010
It's weird.
It's weird hearing him talk about these

2209
01:36:31,011 --> 01:36:34,040
people that he ripped off and finding
these like,

2210
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:35,120
oh they're,
they're fine.

2211
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,100
These people that you know,
they,

2212
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,900
they had money.
It's like they're not,

2213
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:41,420
it's no big deal.
Like you're listening to the way this

2214
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:45,140
guy sort of rationalized.
But he is essentially the poster boy for

2215
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:47,750
that greed at all costs because he was
just,

2216
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:50,690
it was running a Ponzi scheme.
You stealing money from people.

2217
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:51,920
Yeah.
It's funny.

2218
01:36:51,921 --> 01:36:53,720
I was again talking about this with my
husband.

2219
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:56,180
They really don't.
Today we were talking about what is the

2220
01:36:56,181 --> 01:36:58,730
difference between a Republican and a
Democrat?

2221
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:03,290
Like what is essentially the difference?
Cause I know lots,

2222
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:06,380
I have very good friends who are
Republicans who I respect enormously

2223
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:08,060
and,
and you know,

2224
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:11,180
they have taught me a lot and they have
changed the way I view the world and so

2225
01:37:11,181 --> 01:37:15,410
on so forth.
But essentially I wonder is it that

2226
01:37:15,411 --> 01:37:20,411
Democrats are able to utilize their
imagination in an an a republican is

2227
01:37:21,081 --> 01:37:22,250
less imaginative.

2228
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,683
I don't know.
I'm,

2229
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,640
I'm using it light.
I have no answers.

2230
01:37:25,641 --> 01:37:30,160
I'm just curious about what drives
someone towards the left and what drives

2231
01:37:30,161 --> 01:37:34,670
someone towards the right because it's
certainly know that one site is good and

2232
01:37:34,671 --> 01:37:37,820
one side is bad.
One side is really smart and the other

2233
01:37:37,821 --> 01:37:39,890
side isn't it.
It's nothing to do with that.

2234
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:44,891
So what is it that drives us towards
these embattled positions that are the

2235
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:49,550
ins right now in America seems saw
acute,

2236
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:52,100
you know,
there just seems to be new marriage of

2237
01:37:52,101 --> 01:37:55,980
the two sites and I'd love to know why.
I wish I knew about how

2238
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,180
that all works.

2239
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,230
I think people are very easily
influenced.

2240
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,960
I think people are very tribal and I
think people,

2241
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:05,170
it's very easy to influence someone to
get them to adopt a predetermined

2242
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,230
pattern of thinking and if that
predetermined pattern of thinking is

2243
01:38:08,231 --> 01:38:11,290
right wing or left wing,
if you're around those people and you

2244
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:15,220
seek social status by committing to a
certain ideology,

2245
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:18,010
you get embedded in it,
it becomes a part of your thinking,

2246
01:38:18,011 --> 01:38:21,130
becomes a part of your life.
And then that is the pattern that you

2247
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,630
bore.
You dig deep,

2248
01:38:22,631 --> 01:38:25,510
you dig deep trenches in terms of your
psychology.

2249
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:30,400
You dig deep trenches in your mind that
are unwavering and whether there are

2250
01:38:30,401 --> 01:38:33,220
left wing or right wing,
it becomes very problematic when you

2251
01:38:33,221 --> 01:38:36,160
have two teams like that.
We were talking about Holland the other

2252
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,810
day that Hollande has something like 17
different parties that viable parties,

2253
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,790
you know,
unlike what we have where we have this

2254
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:43,510
one too.

2255
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:46,630
And then we have a few joke parties like
the Green party that no one takes

2256
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:48,580
seriously libertarians,
nobody takes seriously,

2257
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:53,320
they never even come close to winning.
And when you have one or two and one of

2258
01:38:53,321 --> 01:38:56,650
them is conservative and one of them is
liberal,

2259
01:38:56,651 --> 01:39:01,651
it just automatically people identify
with one or the other and they,

2260
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,410
whether it's from upbringing or the
community that they're attached to or

2261
01:39:05,411 --> 01:39:08,650
what have you,
or life experiences past positive or

2262
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:10,750
negative,
they just immediately gravitate towards

2263
01:39:10,751 --> 01:39:14,050
one or the other.
They dig in and then they start talking

2264
01:39:14,051 --> 01:39:16,450
shit about the left or they started
talking shit about the right.

2265
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:19,720
And you know,
you've got salon.com and you've got Fox

2266
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,780
News and everybody's lobbing bombs at
each other and it's just fucking weird.

2267
01:39:22,781 --> 01:39:22,950
Okay.

2268
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,620
Why have we not seen any break?
I mean I get that.

2269
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,660
Generally speaking,
like I understand on a,

2270
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:31,140
totally agree with what you're saying
that that generally that is what occurs,

2271
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:35,340
but surely on both sides of the fence
you have free thinkers.

2272
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:37,580
There must be a few.
There's more now.

2273
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:39,480
I think there's more now than ever
before,

2274
01:39:39,481 --> 01:39:44,481
but this is a very weird time in terms
of trump and trump winning because he's,

2275
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:49,120
he's sort of engaged.
The like they,

2276
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:52,710
they've sort of,
there's a bunch of people that are not

2277
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:57,240
necessarily political that are really
into being a right wing or now it's

2278
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:01,110
almost like online trolls and people
that just like to be a part of a team

2279
01:40:01,111 --> 01:40:04,290
and they just like to fuck with people
they call snowflakes are liberals.

2280
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,300
It's weird.
It's weird time.

2281
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,930
I think we're going to get through it.
I think it's like the gold water

2282
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:12,170
republican days.
It's like I think we,

2283
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:15,090
we need to have like bad examples that
we need to go,

2284
01:40:15,091 --> 01:40:16,540
well let's not do that again.
Yeah.

2285
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:17,580
And then collectively

2286
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,590
the arc of history is long.
It is.

2287
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:23,230
And the age of the world is infinite.
It is.

2288
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,620
But the America's young as fuck.
Yeah,

2289
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:29,460
and that's part of the problem.
It's this weird new experiment in self

2290
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:32,010
government.
It's really only been going on for a few

2291
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:32,610
hundred years.
Yeah.

2292
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:35,130
And it's easy to look at a few hundred
years as being a long time,

2293
01:40:35,131 --> 01:40:36,240
but it's really not.
It's not.

2294
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,580
Especially you guys in Scotland,
you know,

2295
01:40:38,581 --> 01:40:39,750
you guys have been around forever.
You'd

2296
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:42,510
be the right fucking braveheart days and
shit.

2297
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,311
Yeah.
But the,

2298
01:40:43,311 --> 01:40:46,380
the thing about the free press,
that's what worries me as a foreigner

2299
01:40:46,381 --> 01:40:48,660
living in this country and seeing this,
this,

2300
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,570
this,
this surface stuff that's being spewed

2301
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:54,820
about the free press is worrisome.
It's worrisome.

2302
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,260
It comes from the president himself.
Yeah.

2303
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:57,041
That's,
that's kind of,

2304
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:57,491
yeah.
I mean,

2305
01:40:57,491 --> 01:40:58,810
yeah,
there's only been two presidents,

2306
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:01,450
our history that have actually gone to
war with the press,

2307
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,880
and one of them was Richard Nixon.
I mean,

2308
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:08,470
this is just so unprecedented time that
someone disrespects the idea of the

2309
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:10,990
press and,
and news.

2310
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:15,080
This is where people can challenge.
Nobody likes getting challenged.

2311
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:16,730
It doesn't feel very nice when somebody
goes,

2312
01:41:16,731 --> 01:41:17,660
no,
I disagree with you.

2313
01:41:17,661 --> 01:41:19,400
It doesn't feel good.
But you know,

2314
01:41:19,401 --> 01:41:23,510
aren't we all at the point where we're
willing to at least listen and start

2315
01:41:23,511 --> 01:41:24,470
like,
yeah.

2316
01:41:24,471 --> 01:41:26,090
But it's very scary,
I think.

2317
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,170
Well,
he's a dictator in a lot of ways.

2318
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:28,741
Yeah.
I mean,

2319
01:41:28,741 --> 01:41:32,130
and then he was challenged the other day
and by cbs they were asking them about

2320
01:41:32,131 --> 01:41:35,060
Obama wiretapping and the lie that he
made up.

2321
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:37,170
Yeah.
And he wound up a multi,

2322
01:41:37,171 --> 01:41:39,510
see,
there's some you say he could say it was

2323
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:41,760
a lie,
but there's some validity to it,

2324
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:44,730
whether it was some surveillance being
going on,

2325
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:47,850
but whether or not it was Obama or
whether or not it's standard

2326
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:51,210
surveillance at the NSA has been
perpetrating for a long time,

2327
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:53,760
which I think was the case.
I think it's more that the ne,

2328
01:41:53,761 --> 01:41:55,950
I think fucking everybody's getting
spied on.

2329
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,810
I mean,
I think that's really what's going on.

2330
01:41:57,870 --> 01:42:01,860
So you can say I'm being spied on.
I think you'd be correct.

2331
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:05,190
But you say Obama spying on me.
I don't think that's correct.

2332
01:42:05,191 --> 01:42:06,910
Yeah.
So I think the interview,

2333
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:07,470
yeah.

2334
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:08,940
He walked out when they were
challenging.

2335
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:10,620
He doesn't like being challenged.
It wasn't like,

2336
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,810
you know,
he doesn't like anybody questioning him

2337
01:42:12,811 --> 01:42:15,300
and he feels like he could just leave.
He doesn't feel like the press is

2338
01:42:15,301 --> 01:42:16,890
important.
He feels like he's got a strong enough

2339
01:42:16,891 --> 01:42:21,630
base and all these people that will just
yell out fake news.

2340
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:25,650
I mean he's made this,
this sort of meme when he pointed that

2341
01:42:25,651 --> 01:42:27,420
CNN guy and said,
you are fake news.

2342
01:42:27,421 --> 01:42:29,430
Yeah.
Like what is,

2343
01:42:29,431 --> 01:42:34,410
this is a scary time for any disturbing.
But I think in some ways that's good.

2344
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:37,470
And this is why I think,
I think we need,

2345
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:42,000
as human beings need resistance.
We need something to push back against.

2346
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:43,500
Yeah.
And it helps us,

2347
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:46,910
it helps us sort of reinvigorate our,
our,

2348
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,740
our collective ideas and re
reinvigorate,

2349
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:53,250
knowing now that this is possible.
We didn't know that was possible before.

2350
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,660
No,
we didn't think he was gonna win.

2351
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:56,130
And if we did,
if he did,

2352
01:42:56,131 --> 01:42:57,870
when Jesus Christ,
we didn't think he was gonna win like

2353
01:42:57,871 --> 01:42:59,520
this.
And you didn't think that he was going

2354
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:03,480
to sort of dismantle the EPA and do all
these different things he's doing

2355
01:43:03,481 --> 01:43:05,940
tikkaway the fucking satellites they use
for climate.

2356
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,930
I mean there's a lot of shit that's
going on that's very problematic to

2357
01:43:09,931 --> 01:43:13,980
science and scientists and they are
being really frustrated right now.

2358
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:16,350
So now they know.
Now they know and now we know.

2359
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,290
No,
I totally agree.

2360
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:18,790
And I think the,
the,

2361
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:23,740
the US press since September 11th have
actually,

2362
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:28,750
the standard of journalism has been
sliding know for a decade if not longer.

2363
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:34,090
And now all of a sudden journalists are
being held to account and they are

2364
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:37,600
having to step up their game again,
which I think is great for the American

2365
01:43:37,601 --> 01:43:40,330
people to have fun.
Enjoy good journalism.

2366
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,583
Yeah,
I think you're right.

2367
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:43,930
Yay.
So we managed to take something

2368
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:44,950
relatively,

2369
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:47,460
I think it's sad.
You don't want to think it is.

2370
01:43:47,461 --> 01:43:49,710
I think it's the same thing that's kind
of happened to the music business.

2371
01:43:49,711 --> 01:43:54,320
I think journalism experience,
this new wave of media and information

2372
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,730
being distributed by anyone,
whether it's a breitbart or anyone who

2373
01:43:58,731 --> 01:44:01,550
just creates a blog.
And just starts pump pumping out their

2374
01:44:01,551 --> 01:44:02,880
agenda,
Huffington Post's,

2375
01:44:02,881 --> 01:44:04,430
salon.com,
whatever it is,

2376
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:09,260
they become these aggregates for news
that they feel fits with their agenda,

2377
01:44:09,261 --> 01:44:11,300
the agenda that they would like to
promote and push.

2378
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:14,540
And you know,
whether it's full left wing,

2379
01:44:14,541 --> 01:44:19,040
like a salon.com or full right wing like
Breitbart,

2380
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,250
both of them are problematic.
And that's where the New York Times is

2381
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:23,084
to really step up.

2382
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,270
I see.
I think they're trying to,

2383
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,200
I think you're right.
Yeah.

2384
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:26,220
Yeah.
I think they are.

2385
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,390
So,
yeah.

2386
01:44:27,391 --> 01:44:28,980
I mean it's,
it's weird times,

2387
01:44:28,981 --> 01:44:31,020
but we're times create great art.
No,

2388
01:44:31,021 --> 01:44:33,180
it does.
It really creates good people too.

2389
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:36,840
Like it's good for it.
I think what you were saying earlier on

2390
01:44:36,841 --> 01:44:38,850
this is really too,
like when people are tested,

2391
01:44:38,851 --> 01:44:43,260
that's when you see them at their best.
So pressure creates diamonds.

2392
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:46,420
Diamonds.
I'm stealing that from my mine.

2393
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,630
He's still it.
I Dunno.

2394
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:50,010
It's the old term.
I believe it's good.

2395
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:50,940
Yeah,
it's good.

2396
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:55,020
It's real.
It's legit working for fund in here on

2397
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:58,320
our loins and shit.
A lot of,

2398
01:44:58,330 --> 01:44:59,760
lot of things happen.
Listen,

2399
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,560
you gotta get Outta here.
Um,

2400
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:02,423
so do you?

2401
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:03,273
Yes,
I do.

2402
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:04,510
So,
um,

2403
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:09,310
where can people find out tour
information and garbage is your twitter

2404
01:45:09,311 --> 01:45:11,050
handle and does that,
do you handle all that?

2405
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:12,320
Do you do that stuff

2406
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:15,500
for the most part I do.
I try and I didn't like the feeling of

2407
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:17,650
some dip tending to be me and putting
words into my mouth.

2408
01:45:17,651 --> 01:45:20,120
So generally speaking,
I do take care of the social media.

2409
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:21,110
That's awesome.
Well,

2410
01:45:21,111 --> 01:45:26,111
it's a bit of a pain,
but I farmed mine out to China now my

2411
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:27,470
farm,
my nights I'll do,

2412
01:45:27,471 --> 01:45:30,260
as I say,
just you read my tweets and whatever I

2413
01:45:30,261 --> 01:45:33,470
say like that.
Just say that say woke.

2414
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,930
You swears lit.
Lit.

2415
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:39,140
I don't use that one.
I was lit.

2416
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:42,140
It was lit.
It was lit.

2417
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,910
Yeah.
How about it was fire?

2418
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,430
I haven't heard that one.
But that's a school.

2419
01:45:46,431 --> 01:45:48,170
That's Viking terminal,
is he?

2420
01:45:48,171 --> 01:45:49,190
Yeah.
Ooh.

2421
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:50,780
Yeah.
You said it like you own it.

2422
01:45:50,781 --> 01:45:55,781
The people I do put 100% vikings,
100% a hundred percent hundred percent.

2423
01:45:55,821 --> 01:45:59,480
I've had a DNA test that was run by my
city of Edinburgh.

2424
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:00,950
I'm super impressed.
You're fine.

2425
01:46:00,951 --> 01:46:01,830
Thank you.
I would like,

2426
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,830
I'm sitting here trying to embrace it.

2427
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:07,510
There it is.
Rage and raptured,

2428
01:46:07,511 --> 01:46:10,760
tour,
blondie and garbage and all of this.

2429
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,220
It looks exciting as fuck.
And uh,

2430
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,880
all of this is available online.
Where,

2431
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:17,723
where can they

2432
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:22,730
get no shame to see?
I would imagine it's on the faith on our

2433
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:25,650
website,
which is garbage.call me people can find

2434
01:46:25,651 --> 01:46:26,550
it.
People can find it.

2435
01:46:26,551 --> 01:46:28,380
If you can't find it,
just don't show up.

2436
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:32,700
You can't find it on my birthday.
You're going to be in Austin,

2437
01:46:32,701 --> 01:46:33,880
Texas.
What did you say?

2438
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:35,530
August 11th.
That's my birthday.

2439
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:36,690
You gonna be in Austin,
Texas.

2440
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,580
Yeah,
I know this baby as well.

2441
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,960
Oh,
shut the fuck up.

2442
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:42,210
Shut the fuck up.
I am on crazy.

2443
01:46:42,211 --> 01:46:43,840
So hold on.
What sign are you a Leo?

2444
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:46,370
You're such a Leo,
Leo.

2445
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:47,280
I'm not.
I'm a virgo.

2446
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:52,260
Shirley Manson.
You're awesome.

2447
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,620
Thank you.
Thank you for being on.

2448
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,510
All right fuckers.
We'll be back soon.

2449
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:00,130
Bye.
I'm sweating here.
