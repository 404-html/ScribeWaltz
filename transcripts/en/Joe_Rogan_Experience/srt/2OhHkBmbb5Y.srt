1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,450
Should I,
should I do headphones?

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:04,190
It doesn't matter.
Yeah,

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,820
like headphones.
I kind of hate hearing myself that way.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,680
Sound good.
Why did you hear yourself?

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,780
Do you try to pull this sucker up like 
about a fist from your face?

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,153
Good to see you again,
man.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,930
It's been a long time.
It has been.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,220
What?
The guy like you.

9
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:18,630
It's always nice to see you're still 
alive.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,750
Do you remember best to get tired of 
hearing shit like that?

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,471
Oh,
I don't care.

12
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,304
I mean,
do you get tired of the weirdness of 

13
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,190
like interviewing with people and 
they're like,

14
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,790
you know,
you know you could die.

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,890
Is this scary?
Yeah.

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,850
Yeah.
That's all right though.

17
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:33,640
I mean,
the thing.

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,270
Yeah,
it's funny.

19
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,103
A tournament,
the film we've been doing q and a's 

20
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:36,774
every night.
You get the same questions from the 

21
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,780
audience all the time and part of that 
is tiring,

22
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,614
but then part of it like people ask some
questions because they're obvious 

23
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,510
because everybody wants to know the same
things and I'm like,

24
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,344
I understand that one of the weirdest 
parts of the film is when they're 

25
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:54,291
showing all the guys who have died from 
free soloing and they're actually.

26
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,880
They didn't all die free soloing.
Oh,

27
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,813
that's actually one of the.
That's probably the only thing that I 

28
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,810
take slight issue with a film,
slightly hyperbolic [inaudible].

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,640
The two of them died base jumping and 
one of them died rope jumping.

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,700
They were all were free solos,
which is kind of what the film is saying

31
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,530
that they're all free solis who have 
died,

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,510
but they all died in the mountains doing
mountain related extreme activities,

33
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,663
you know,
that's.

34
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,520
That doesn't make the story is good.
That's like poetic license.

35
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,990
Yeah,
he got sneaky.

36
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,250
Well,
you know,

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,610
I mean they all were free solace,
but yeah,

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,850
that's not the same though.
Yeah,

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,421
no,
exactly.

40
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,470
I,
I preferred it.

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,830
The other way to look at it is the no 
free solis has ever died doing anything.

42
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:35,664
Cutting edge.
That's my favorite statistic that I'm 

43
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,760
like no free solos has ever died doing 
hard solar.

44
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,153
Like basically free a few free solos 
have died falling off at easy turn or 

45
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,370
just falling off sort of routine or you 
know,

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,380
I don't know,
just falling off the mountain,

47
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,510
but none of them have ever died while 
doing something,

48
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,344
cutting edge.
Something that had never been done 

49
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,840
before.
Something that was you hardcore.

50
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,903
Do you think that's because when you're 
doing something that's a little bit 

51
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,780
easier,
you relax.

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,033
I think that's probably part of it,
but also I think part of it is just a 

53
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,704
numbers thing.
You spend so much time doing easy stuff 

54
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,430
and so little time doing really hard 
stuff that,

55
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,350
you know,
it's just statistics.

56
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,020
But um,
how much,

57
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,883
how important is it when,
when you were free soloing to have that 

58
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:21,000
edge to be like really cognizant about 
how intense this is?

59
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,760
Like if you got to calm to relaxed.
No,

60
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,510
I think that's.

61
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,820
I think that is kind of the concern for 
sure.

62
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,430
And I,
I've noticed that in for myself anyway,

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,593
and I try not to do very much easy 
soloing anymore because there is a 

64
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,510
certain complacency that overtime,
you know,

65
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,550
you just do so much mileage on easy 
terrain and then you're like,

66
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,930
this is so easy,
this is so easy.

67
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,840
And then you slip and you die.
Well,

68
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,380
you know,
you know,

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,233
fighters look at things that way too.
Like they at a certain point in their 

70
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,580
life,
they don't want easy fights because they

71
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,640
need to get challenged,
otherwise they won't train properly.

72
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,430
And then they wind up losing to be.
Yeah,

73
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,330
you should take it seriously.
Yeah.

74
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,860
Well the difference between a fighter 
say

75
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,570
when they're not trained in not in camp 
and just their skill and what their body

76
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,660
can do without,
without going through a camp is probably

77
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:12,661
only like 70 percent of what they are 
when they actually go through everything

78
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,810
with full intensity,
eight weeks,

79
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,060
two times a day,
you know,

80
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,790
physical therapy,
massage,

81
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,540
visualization,
conditioning,

82
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,374
all the,
all the things that make them who they 

83
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:31,240
are the day they step into the cage.
Like when you free Solo.

84
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,440
It's funny that,
so that's,

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,993
yeah,
I mean if you saw the film and that's 

86
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,590
all a exactly the level of preparation 
that went into it.

87
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,720
Do you take time off before a big free 
solo?

88
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,970
Do you like,
you just kind of the opposite.

89
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:44,920
It's the.
No,

90
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,120
it's the opposite.
It's sort of ramping up to it.

91
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,320
Right.
But do you,

92
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,573
is there any concern that maybe you 
haven't given yourself enough 

93
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,100
recuperative time like that for the day 
of.

94
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,870
No,
so for me anyway,

95
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:57,704
it was always sort of the opposite 
because the real challenge of free 

96
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:01,250
soloing is the psychological side of the
mental side of it.

97
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,343
It's not so much the physical,
like I don't necessarily have to 

98
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,730
physically perform at the absolute limit
of what I'm capable of,

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,040
but I have to mentally perform at that 
level.

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,233
And so,
and the mental side of it comes so much 

101
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,600
from confidence and feeling,
you know,

102
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,390
feeling prepared.
And so I don't know.

103
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,070
So when I,
when I freestyle it all cap,

104
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,260
I kind of knew that I wasn't actually,
um,

105
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,650
like I'd probably already started to 
decline a little bit physically over the

106
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:25,484
course of the season because the two 
months in the seventies just kind of 

107
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:27,644
grueling on her body,
like it all the time I spent going up 

108
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,950
and down on the wall and preparing.

109
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,060
It's very,
very tiring.

110
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,350
And so I kind of realized that I was 
starting to get sort of deeply fatigued.

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,260
I was sort of a week away from having 
started a slump,

112
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,590
a black girl.
I'm Kinda pooped.

113
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,060
But the thing is I knew that that 
because of all that preparation,

114
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:45,450
you know,
psychologically I was as,

115
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,313
as good as I was ever going to be.
So even if I was physically starting to 

116
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,000
be a little bit tired,
it's like time to,

117
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,030
you know,
it's kind of the different curves.

118
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,290
You have to hit it right at the right 
moment.

119
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,583
No.
Is your psychological preparation just 

120
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:01,770
you getting your mind into it or do you 
have like specific techniques you use or

121
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:06,210
a form of meditation or anything that 
you specifically concentrate on?

122
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,100
When you're visualizing success or

123
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,053
no,
when it's not even necessarily 

124
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:14,130
visualizing success or it's visualizing,
for me it's visualizing the experience,

125
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,173
like sort of imagining what everything 
will feel like imagining what it would 

126
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,410
like to place my foot on a hold or what,
you know,

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,650
grabbing like the sensations of it and 
the exposure of it.

128
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,990
Um,
you know,

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,670
thinking through what it'll feel like 
with so much air around me and no rope.

130
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,140
Just that basically to make sure that 
nothing is surprising when I get there

131
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,360
to my hands are sweating.
Just talking to you.

132
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,820
I'm not kidding.
Feel that,

133
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,610
feel that.
That's fucking gross.

134
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,680
Right?
As a clam.

135
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,850
I realized it like when I'm talking to 
you,

136
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,820
I'm thinking about you doing this and my
hands started sweating.

137
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,210
You start thinking about thousands of a 
or in your life.

138
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,110
Start thinking about chalk and powder 
and that shit like that.

139
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,243
God Damn Dude.
Have you ever gone to like a sports 

140
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,610
psychologist

141
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,610
or have you ever actively tried to 
coordinate a program for mental training

142
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,370
or anything like that?
No,

143
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,121
not really.
I mean,

144
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,954
so with,
with reselling ocap I found that I 

145
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,580
needed to create enough space for,
it's not so much mental training but um,

146
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,473
but create enough empty time so that I 
had a so that I was able to sort of 

147
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,860
process so,
um,

148
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,680
I don't know,
so I like stopped shooting an email.

149
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,514
I raised my social media,
like sort of freedom my life and then 

150
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,800
actually my girlfriend left for the sort
of the week ahead of time,

151
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,440
so that was just totally by myself and 
my van with nothing going on,

152
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,200
like no distractions.
And so that's not exactly,

153
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,940
you know,
mental training,

154
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,774
but it was giving myself the free time 
that I could just sit around and think 

155
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:42,471
about things,
you know,

156
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,990
I can process it in my own terms in my 
own time.

157
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,940
When was the last time we talked?
How many years ago?

158
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,080
It was so long.
I feel like it was at least for right?

159
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,940
Oh No,
it was like six or seven.

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,430
It wasn't I think so.
I think it was like 2012 or something.

161
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,413
During that time.
How much has changed in your life in 

162
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,624
terms of the way people perceive what 
you do and the amount of attention that 

163
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,124
you get?
I would imagine that having that alone 

164
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:08,460
time now you as much harder.
Yeah.

165
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,171
Yeah.
No,

166
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,130
totally.
It's,

167
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,710
it's funny.
I mean I've tried to not let my life get

168
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,900
busy over time,
but it just sort of naturally happens.

169
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,550
I mean,
what would success?

170
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,181
Yeah,
exactly.

171
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:19,890
Just some one more times.
I'll be.

172
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,490
When I was reached out to you,
I reached out to you a couple of times,

173
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,370
but I was like,
this guy is probably getting fucked with

174
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,233
all the time.

175
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,073
Like someone's probably always poking at
you and you're just trying to get a 

176
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,970
foothold.
Like literally just trying to hold on.

177
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,073
No,
I mean,

178
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,771
no,
I mean I,

179
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:37,010
I appreciate all the opportunities that 
have now and you know,

180
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,903
I mean I'm,
I'm very happy with the way my life has 

181
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:40,424
changed over time,
but certainly when I look back at 10 or 

182
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:46,970
12 years ago when I was just a single 20
year old man living in a car,

183
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,280
like I had nothing going on.
You know,

184
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,031
if,
uh,

185
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,160
if I had like one interview in a month,
I'd be like,

186
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,570
well,
it's a big month for media,

187
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,200
you know,
and then now on the film tour,

188
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,053
it's like completely outrageous.
It's totally the other end of the 

189
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,120
spectrum.
Now when you do in this film to uh,

190
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,960
when,
when does the film actually come out?

191
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,040
Films like out.

192
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,480
It's in theaters.
So I couldn't go see right now.

193
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,340
But you can't get it on itunes yet.
Is that what it is?

194
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,560
So yeah.
So,

195
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,110
so it did a month of festival circuit 
in,

196
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,973
you know,
earlier in the end of the summer and 

197
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,760
then it came out in theaters at the end 
of September.

198
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,760
So right now I think this weekend is its
widest release.

199
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,490
It's like 400 theaters all over the 
country are now.

200
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,720
Wow.
But,

201
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,850
and then in theory,
um,

202
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,110
it's through national geographic,
so I think it'll be on television,

203
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,170
on the channel at some point and then 
eventually it'll stream somewhere.

204
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,440
I Dunno.
Is it strange all this attention?

205
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,613
Yeah,
I mean,

206
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,111
well,
I don't know.

207
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:39,950
It's in some ways it's a natural 
extension of all the stuff I've had over

208
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:40,461
the years,
you know,

209
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,730
like having a 60 minutes piece and many 
years ago was a bit of a,

210
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,623
it was a flurry of attention and so 
they're kind of sort of prepared me in 

211
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:49,340
some ways,
you know.

212
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,080
But yeah,
I mean,

213
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
and well,
you've dealt with this your whole life.

214
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,380
I mean it's.
Yeah,

215
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,340
but I'm asking like an interesting.
Yeah.

216
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,890
But I feel like it comes with what I do.
I'm in show business.

217
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,960
That's,
you know what I mean?

218
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,760
That's fair.
You're,

219
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,680
you're a climber.
Yeah.

220
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,830
And the most radical kind of climber 
free solo you think when I think of what

221
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,960
you do,
I think of quiet tension.

222
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,050
Yeah.
That's,

223
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,470
that's kind of fair.
Yeah.

224
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,313
Because it should be,
it should be sort of meditative and 

225
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:21,840
relaxing and quiet,
but then obviously you're also sometimes

226
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,270
straining your entire body,
you know,

227
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,430
like trying very hard physically and.
Yeah.

228
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,503
Well I remember one of the things you 
said to me the last time we talked was 

229
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:33,210
that it's,
it's very mellow because if it ever gets

230
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,730
intense,
something's gone wrong.

231
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,040
Yeah,
no,

232
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,480
I still feel exactly the same way.

233
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,820
I mean that's,
yeah,

234
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,620
that's always the challenge is to keep 
it,

235
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,380
keep it relaxed,
but for a guy like you,

236
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,360
my perception of a guy like you,
who's that?

237
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,380
That person who's doing that activity 
than to sort of juxtapose that with this

238
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,610
media tour type environment and dealing 
with all these people that,

239
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,050
that,
that seems to me like it would be really

240
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,630
annoying.
I mean,

241
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:07,464
yeah,
it's very different than my normal 

242
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,530
normal lifestyle I guess.
But the thing is,

243
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,683
you know,
it's sort of an adventure and it's an 

244
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:13,530
experience in its own way.
I've been,

245
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,860
I've been kind of calling it a 
expedition film tour because a,

246
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,240
I've done a lot of expeditions in my 
life.

247
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,300
Like last winter I went to Antarctica 
for a month and,

248
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,520
and it's not exactly the type of climate
that normally do and I don't really like

249
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,990
being cold,
but you sort of like,

250
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,270
oh it a once in a lifetime opportunity 
to go somewhere,

251
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,920
you know,
it was like going to Mars or something.

252
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,420
It was this totally outrageous 
experience.

253
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,254
We're climbing big rock walls and in an 
article you're just living on the 

254
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,640
glacier and it's totally different.
Totally crazy.

255
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,940
He camped out on a glacier.
Yeah.

256
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,793
Yeah.
We're just in a tent on a glacier for a 

257
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,050
month.
When you do that,

258
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,670
how thick a pad do you use?
A really thick and a very,

259
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,000
very thick sleeping bag.
Do you ever get warm?

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,541
Uh,
yeah,

261
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,330
yeah,
yeah,

262
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,151
yeah.
In Your Sleep Med.

263
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:50,700
It's a negative 40 degree sleeping bag.
I mean,

264
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:53,100
it's pretty good job but.
But anyway,

265
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,780
I mean,
so that kind of experience,

266
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,063
you know,
in some ways it's very comparable to a 

267
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,650
film to where I'm like,
this is going to be a once in a lifetime

268
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,790
thing.
You just embrace it.

269
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,990
You go with it,
you know,

270
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,480
it's different than the way you normally
choose to live your life,

271
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:04,710
but that kind of makes it understanding,
you know,

272
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:05,580
it's something new.

273
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,773
Well,
I can imagine it would be very 

274
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:11,550
interesting.
The Antarctica thing sounds like a trip.

275
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,600
Yeah.
Like were you traveling on uh,

276
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,550
uh,
established corridor?

277
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,081
It was.
No,

278
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:19,360
no.
It's what.

279
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,240
So some people had climbed in the region
before,

280
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,074
but um,
but we actually did tons of first 

281
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,470
ascents like roots and summits that had 
never been climbed.

282
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,750
Wow.
Yeah,

283
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,680
that's pretty cool.
Now when you do something like that,

284
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:31,020
do you map it out in advance?
Like,

285
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:31,951
I mean,
well,

286
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,140
not really because I mean they're photos
of,

287
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,600
of the formations and people,
like I said,

288
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,350
it climbed some of them.
Um,

289
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,310
some Norwegians had sort of pioneered 
the area and written a book about it,

290
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,563
but um,
but then it's not until you get there 

291
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:46,620
that you can really decide what you're 
going to climb and how it looks.

292
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,454
I mean ultimately you have to look at 
the rock and see if it's climate 

293
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,340
bowling,
so you basically just have to ski up and

294
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,880
then touch it and see what you can do 
and then try to climate you ski up where

295
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,000
you are because you're living on a 
glacier.

296
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,070
I mean you have to ski everyone.
Wow.

297
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,050
It was cool.
I did a,

298
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,500
I did a month wearing only ski boots or 
climate shoes.

299
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,640
Wow.
Or,

300
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,520
or my bedroom slippers are on camp.
What'd you feet feel like?

301
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,903
Oh No,
we're in a really thick socks and then 

302
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,850
keeping everything as warm as possible,
but,

303
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,290
but yeah,
I mean we're in climate.

304
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,950
Jews in Antarctica goes pretty chilly.
Yeah.

305
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,933
Actually there's a film about that 
coming out in a couple of weeks I think 

306
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,630
as part of the real rocky or it's like a
big climbing film festival thing or film

307
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,420
tour that sort of shows around the 
world.

308
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,430
But.
So it's like a 40 minute short.

309
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,890
They're 30 minutes short.
I'm actually,

310
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:33,724
I haven't seen it yet,
but those shoes that you wear on a 

311
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:40,400
normal climb are very flexible with 
those last sportiva yeah,

312
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,300
that's what I said.

313
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,820
Our,
yeah,

314
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,653
they're very,
they almost look like a sock with a 

315
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:47,240
rubber bottom to it where you could 
really kind of grip.

316
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,750
It depends.
So some are super soft like that.

317
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,613
Um,
it depends on what you're trying to 

318
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:51,934
climb that summer.
Really rigid so that you can step on a 

319
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:55,000
really small holes and it supports your 
foot.

320
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,273
So like what I was wearing,
free soloing El cap is quite rigid 

321
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,380
actually.
It's like a board,

322
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,630
like a platform.
So that you can put just the tip of your

323
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:04,000
toe on something really small and you're
focused to stay,

324
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,250
stay flat,
welcome mountaineering type of.

325
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,320
Yeah,
kind of,

326
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,630
but still also very precise because 
mountaineering boot,

327
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:13,720
you think clunky and big climbing shoes,
like a ballet slipper,

328
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:17,440
like precise and tight.
But then also rigid sometimes.

329
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,210
Yeah.
And then also,

330
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,044
I don't know,
you know,

331
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,033
when you're climbing cracks,
you put your foot into the crack and 

332
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,160
then torque it sideways to like lock it 
into place.

333
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,070
And so the stiffer the shoe is,
the more it can,

334
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,010
you know,
the more that you can lock the shoe into

335
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,090
place,
it's pose your foot.

336
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:32,510
You basically have to use fewer muscles.
I,

337
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,344
when are you starting a trend?
Are there other people that are 

338
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:38,440
following you footsteps now?
Actually,

339
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,510
what do you think?
I think probably.

340
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:41,830
Yeah.
You think,

341
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,030
yeah,
you honestly think though.

342
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,073
Yeah,
I think there's probably some people 

343
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,090
that look at what you're doing and the 
young kids that think it must be,

344
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,673
you know,
here's what I think most people look at 

345
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:55,360
the path that the average person takes 
in life,

346
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,250
you know?
Oh No,

347
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,200
sell cars,
I'm going to be an insurance guy,

348
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,390
and they look,
they look at it like it's death for.

349
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:02,224
They look at a kid,
a young kid who's like enjoying playing 

350
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,544
with his friends or doing sports or 
playing video games or reading comic 

351
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:15,421
books and then you look at what could be
the average path that the average person

352
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,374
takes in life and sitting in an office 
all day under fluorescent lights and it 

353
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:21,280
looks like death.

354
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,500
It looks like a slow aching death,
but then I look at someone like you.

355
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:26,951
I'm like,
wow,

356
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:27,784
this guy is living a special life.
This is a special life was so ideally 

357
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:31,864
though somebody would look at it and see
that this is somebody living a very 

358
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,570
intentional life or having chosen a 
certain path,

359
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,750
not necessarily free selling.
I mean I would love to inspire people to

360
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:42,730
live an intentional life that they care 
about.

361
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,770
I don't necessarily feel like people 
need to go free solar.

362
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,310
Right.
Well I think that's.

363
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,070
That's a very good way of describing it.
Very good way of putting.

364
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,280
Because I think you most

365
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,110
certainly have influenced people in that
regard,

366
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,393
but I think also people must be 
influenced in the sense that they see 

367
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,871
where you're doing is man,
there's moments that you must experience

368
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,240
while you are climbing these incredible 
faces that are kind of magical.

369
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,030
When you're up there,
you're a thousand feet up there.

370
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:14,864
The view is fucking spectacular and 
you're doing it and you get to the top 

371
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:20,804
of these things though the rush and the 
feeling of accomplishment and the 

372
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:26,810
euphoria and just the glory of nature

373
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,990
from the perspective yet,
or like,

374
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,833
look at this.
You could fucking wash your clothes on 

375
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,420
the sweat.
That's in my hands right now,

376
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,500
man.
That's a stat.

377
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,210
Fucking pictures insane.
We're looking at,

378
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,220
what is the name of this photo,
Jamie?

379
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,490
It's a endura corner from cap.
That's actually,

380
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,460
that's a movie poster.
Do Fuck.

381
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:51,294
That man

382
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,680
is so,
so that,

383
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,850
that that is not sitting in a cubicle.
That is

384
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,780
not fluorescent light.
That is the end of a very long path that

385
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:05,160
you have to choose and really cultivate.
You know what I mean?

386
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,160
That's,
that's for me,

387
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:06,994
23 years of sort of going into or 22 
years or something of going down a very 

388
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:13,330
specific path.
Very specific,

389
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,620
you know.
And you're still.

390
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,200
Do you have a different van?
Are you still in the same van?

391
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,810
I'm in a better man.
The last time I was here.

392
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,153
Moving on.
Yeah,

393
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,000
moved up.
It was pretty exciting.

394
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,270
And to have a house now that's actually 
a real person.

395
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,770
I live in La.
I live in Las Vegas now.

396
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,710
Do you realize?
Yeah.

397
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:28,900
Yeah.
Why Las Vegas?

398
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,160
Uh,
do the best,

399
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,070
best four season climate in the country.
We Love Las Vegas.

400
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,233
Yeah,
there's climbing everywhere and it's 

401
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,630
super accessible and it's easy and it's 
cheap.

402
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,760
Cost of living easy.
You no traffic like everything is easy,

403
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,130
but I love Vegas.

404
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,810
That's cool.
Yeah.

405
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:44,644
Um,
whenever I go to Vegas I was looking at 

406
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:46,954
the mountains outside of it and they're 
right there and nobody even looks at 

407
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:52,600
them from my driveway.
You can see 2000 foot walls.

408
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,000
I mean you,
you can be climbing on a 2000 foot long,

409
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
25 minute drive,
20 minute drive.

410
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,270
That's interesting.
Yeah.

411
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:01,180
A lot of people like to run those 
mountains to run those hills.

412
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:03,220
There's a lot of trail runners that live
in that area as well.

413
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:03,731
Yeah,
totally.

414
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,110
Yeah.
The west side of town and you're like in

415
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:05,621
the mountains.
I mean,

416
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:07,100
I can go mountain biking.
I can go hiking,

417
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,953
I can go climbing on 20 minutes.
You Vegas is kind of a misunderstood 

418
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:13,480
place really is.
Everyone just thinks the strip,

419
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:16,260
but it's like it's not really the strip.
It's like the mountains all around it,

420
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,610
but biggest is like in a bowl of 
mountains.

421
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,620
I mean all sides of it are surrounded by
mountains.

422
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,730
Will Nevada in general kind of gets 
weird because.

423
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,973
Yeah,
I know people think of the desert in 

424
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:27,790
Nevada,
but really it's mountains.

425
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,280
I mean it's like series of mountain 
ranges all the way across the state.

426
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,241
Yeah,
it really is.

427
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:34,750
I have a buddy who lives in Reno.
He lives outside of Reno and if you went

428
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,100
near where he lives,
he'd be like,

429
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,140
where are we?
Call Rato.

430
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,020
Yeah,
exactly.

431
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,800
Exactly.
No,

432
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,240
I'm in Tahoe,
like talk was right there and yeah,

433
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,074
in truckee donner,
I mean there's a bunch of commentary is 

434
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:44,644
right there.
They're great and freaking skiing all 

435
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:46,810
winter.
It's pretty cool.

436
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,710
How old,
you know,

437
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,370
I'm a 33.
Do you feel

438
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,203
any difference in the way your body 
responds to doing this on a regular 

439
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:57,090
basis now?
Maybe a little bit.

440
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,570
Um,
I'm,

441
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,900
I hate to say I'm getting old and 
everything but uh,

442
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,180
but I think especially right now with 
the film to her,

443
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,310
the amount of travel,
I'm like,

444
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:08,490
I'm more intentional about my diet and 
stuff now and trying to get enough sleep

445
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,780
and things like that.
So in the,

446
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,763
you know,
10 years ago I could just eat a whole 

447
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,280
tray oreos and be like,
all right,

448
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,140
I feel great.
Let's go climb in the gym.

449
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,003
It'll be fun,
you know,

450
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,300
now I'm like,
Oh man,

451
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,640
I want my green smoothie,
I want to get my night's sleep.

452
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,770
And Yeah,
I saw that you're,

453
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:27,310
you're not eating meat anymore.
And then you eat a lot of vegetables and

454
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,770
do you get your blood work done or do 
you do work with nutritionists?

455
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,080
No.
Yeah,

456
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,153
yeah,
yeah.

457
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,383
Good.
Good.

458
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,241
Um,
yeah,

459
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,530
and I mean I don't have cheese and stuff
and I mean even meat.

460
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:42,090
So I mean I gave up eating meat for 
environmental reasons mostly,

461
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,303
um,
like basically impact on the earth and 

462
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:47,940
so I'm not fundamentally pose,
you know,

463
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,880
like I'll eat meat from time to time 
certainly for,

464
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:51,240
for cultural norms.
Like uh,

465
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,100
you know,
I was in Japan earlier this year and I'm

466
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,993
sorry fish,
they're a bit just because I felt like 

467
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:57,420
it was part of the sort of Japanese 
travel experience.

468
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,510
Um,
if someone hunted it,

469
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,050
would you eat it?
Yeah,

470
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:01,884
yeah,
sometimes.

471
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,083
But the thing is I just don't feel like 
I need to intentionally kill another 

472
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,744
creature for me to survive.
And so if somebody was going to go 

473
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,920
hunting for me to eat,
I'd be like,

474
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:11,754
no,
that's fine.

475
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,190
We're going to need that.
But then I'm like,

476
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,024
on an expedition to Antarctica,
I ate a bunch of random meat just 

477
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,690
because it's like,
it's already there,

478
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,583
you know,
the other team members have already 

479
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:20,520
brought it.

480
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,450
I'm sort of like,
well,

481
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,410
I'm hungry or whatever,
you know.

482
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,793
Um,
mollusks are actually a good thing for 

483
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:28,884
people to look into that are Vegan or 
vegetarian and they don't want to eat 

484
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:35,580
meat because they're actually more 
primitive even than vegetables.

485
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,340
They're not like,
like,

486
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,840
um,
clams and scallops.

487
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:41,790
They're incredibly primitive.
They,

488
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,250
they have no feelings.
They don't feel anything.

489
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,084
They have no that there's an argument 
that could be made that plants 

490
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:54,261
communicate far more than mollusks 
lobster,

491
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,960
oysters rather mussels.
Barnacles.

492
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,760
Yeah,
crunchy.

493
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,510
But there's a protein to them that's 
similar to an animal protein,

494
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,410
but incredibly primitive to what I mean,
insect protein.

495
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,920
I think it's sort of a potential future 
of humanity today.

496
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,341
Um,
yeah,

497
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:12,174
I'm not,
I'm not fundamentally opposed to eating 

498
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,160
insects,
but it's just,

499
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,480
you know,
they're rarely served.

500
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,010
But I would just imagine that 
particularly as you get older,

501
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,430
like nutrition would be a major factor.

502
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,263
Making sure you get the proper amount of
essential fatty acids and making sure 

503
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:32,421
that because your brain must be like you
have to fuel your brain in terms of like

504
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,923
giving your brain the building blocks 
for neurotransmitters and all these 

505
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,500
different things that you're.
You're using when you're.

506
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,260
You've got this intense concentration 
for many,

507
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,170
many hours at a time and you're not 
eating when you're doing these things.

508
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
Sometimes you do stop and you eat 
something.

509
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,253
I mean you have to.
I mean if you're criminal or something 

510
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:54,270
like flowers,
sometimes little bars or nut butter.

511
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,790
Fairmount are.
Yeah,

512
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,880
those f bombs.
Do you ever take those that has that?

513
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,880
Oh,
they're great.

514
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,220
I have a whole box of them will give you
some.

515
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,290
They them,
yeah.

516
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,300
It's called a [inaudible].
It's called F bomb,

517
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,343
like fat bomb,
but it's all like nut butter and oils 

518
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,460
and it comes in a packet.

519
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,860
You just ripped the top of the package 
off and squeeze it in your mouth.

520
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,600
I had three x morning.
Oh Wow.

521
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,160
That's really good.
It's really healthy.

522
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,070
If one sitting around,
I'm curious.

523
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,040
I want to do have them in the back.
I finished it.

524
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,420
Um,
yes.

525
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,283
That is it.
Tell Jeff there's a box of them in my 

526
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,810
office over there.
You know where the boxes just go.

527
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,000
You can go run in and grab them.
Go run into that door,

528
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,253
run into the office door and like 
sitting right in the front to the right 

529
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,640
hand side.
There's a box of them.

530
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,750
I'll give you that.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

531
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,810
The know butterflies.
I eat the shit out of those things.

532
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:47,644
I eat like three or four of them in the 
morning when I'm headed out the door 

533
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:51,330
with a cup of coffee.
Like a lot of,

534
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,510
a lot of that though.

535
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,593
It was just a lot of calories at there.
I'm doing this sober October fitness 

536
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:59,710
challenge with my friends.
I've been working out.

537
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:04,711
I'm not now no bullshit as much as five 
hours in a day because I'm trying to win

538
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:08,170
this.
We have a wwe style championship belts.

539
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,150
It says intercontinental champion.
So rocktober or intergalactic champions.

540
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,130
So the sober part though,
does that mean you're not?

541
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,600
No Pot,
no booze,

542
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,740
no nothing.
Oh yeah.

543
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,460
Here's your just clean living for all of
October and training.

544
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,290
Fricken brainer.
Yeah.

545
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,120
Well we were wearing these,
uh,

546
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,240
these belts that measure your heart rate
and they also quantify your performance,

547
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:36,040
like how much calories you've burned.
And there it is.

548
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,590
He could take that.
That's tufts to shit.

549
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,940
What flavors?
That one,

550
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,400
um,
academia pecan with Cecil.

551
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,383
Fantastic stuff.
I liked the chocolate and sea salt one 

552
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,710
too.
I'll look through in a sample of players

553
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,270
are good.

554
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,070
That's cool.
It's a real healthy.

555
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,390
It's,
you know,

556
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,490
just watch it.
It's really what you need.

557
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,720
You actually list ingredients or.
Yeah,

558
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,341
yeah.
No,

559
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:59,150
it seems awesome.
And you just tear,

560
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,600
you smush them up and you tear the top 
and just squirt it in your mouth.

561
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,270
Yeah,
I do that climbing a lot.

562
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,310
I kind of prefer that to,
to um,

563
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,650
you know,
gels or Goo or whatever you want to call

564
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:11,200
it because that's just pure sugar.
I kind of prefer to have pure fat.

565
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,940
Yeah.
Certainly for climbing,

566
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,110
um,
it's just not like in,

567
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:15,963
it's not like running or cycling or 
something where your engine is burning 

568
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:20,260
nonstop where you kind of need to just 
like pumps sugar into it.

569
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,900
It's kind of a longer slow burn.
You can,

570
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,850
you can eat fat for sure.
Do you ever,

571
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:26,950
um,
mess around with nootropics at all?

572
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,010
I've never even heard that word.
Nootropics are,

573
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,210
are the building blocks for human 
neurotransmitters.

574
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,133
It's like they're there.
Their supplements that enhanced 

575
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,760
cognitive function is,
some of them are like standard,

576
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,950
what you'd get at like Gnc you wouldn't 
think of as a nootropic,

577
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,980
but they're finding out they are

578
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,530
like creatine.
They're finding out creatine is actually

579
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,364
a pretty potent nootropic.
It actually enhances cognitive 

580
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:52,790
performance.
But,

581
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,624
um,
there's one called Alpha brain that my 

582
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,620
company has.
I'll send a bunch of it to you.

583
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,680
There's another company called neuro one
that makes a great one.

584
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,220
You know,
Bill,

585
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,940
Roman [inaudible] is a former NFL player
who,

586
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,520
uh,
you know,

587
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,970
took a lot of patriots.
No,

588
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,070
it mostly on the broncos.
Yeah.

589
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,260
Savage,
crazy animals.

590
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,130
And during his day,
you know,

591
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:20,900
obviously sustained a lot of head 
injuries and wanted to find some sort of

592
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:24,830
a natural way to replenish his brain 
function.

593
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,270
So He created this company called neuro 
one and that's.

594
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,570
This is how I found out about nootropics
is through his,

595
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,320
his product.
It's fantastic.

596
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,910
Great stuff.
It's just powder.

597
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,100
You put it in water,
shake it up.

598
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,080
It actually has a protein and a bunch of
different neurotransmitters in it,

599
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,240
but it's really good for enhancing 
function.

600
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,940
Interesting.
I wonder if it actually works.

601
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,863
Yeah,
it does.

602
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,340
Well,
Alpha brain,

603
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,253
my company,
we had two double blind placebo 

604
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:54,314
controlled studies with the Boston 
Center for memory that showed 

605
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:01,121
improvements in verbal memory and 
reaction time in peak alpha flow state.

606
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,920
So what is peak out propose to?
That's a good question.

607
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,730
You have to start to dive into it.
Yeah,

608
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,440
they're all the.
If you go to [inaudible] dot com,

609
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:15,770
all of the tests are available.
You can go over what it means,

610
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:18,580
but what,
what you find from these.

611
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,380
Another one called true brain that.
What is that guy's name?

612
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,500
That when he was a guest to the podcast,
Dr Andrew.

613
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,740
No,
that's Andy Galpin.

614
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,293
There's my point is besides my company 
does a bunch of companies and make a 

615
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:37,331
really good ones and they are fantastic.
If you have to give speeches or have you

616
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,100
talked to one of the things that I do 
like

617
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,580
commentary,
straight cocaine,

618
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,414
you,
you're all fired up and you just give a 

619
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:46,760
great talk or anything.
You're like,

620
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,070
methamphetamines,
you just get all fired up.

621
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,910
That's a question I had for you too.
Like how many people that are doing what

622
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:57,911
you do are on either adderall or they 
take things like Beta blockers,

623
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,520
that sort of.
Honestly I think nobody but I mean a lot

624
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:04,370
of climbers smoke a lot of weed or you 
know,

625
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,204
and nowadays I don't even know what you 
do with it because you don't even have 

626
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:10,880
to smoke.
Just you drink it and stuff.

627
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:11,714
I don't know.
There's so many like cannabis things 

628
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,270
now,
but um,

629
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:14,781
but no,
I don't know.

630
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,310
So I,
I've never really done drugs.

631
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:18,820
I don't,
I'm not totally interested center,

632
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,150
they know anything about it.
But um,

633
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,793
I don't know.
It's interesting because it's not like 

634
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,294
anyone's drug testing climbers and 
unless they're competing in the world 

635
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:27,770
cup level or it's actually gonna be in 
the Olympics in 2020,

636
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:29,620
but yeah,
climbing goes,

637
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,500
it's like a demonstration.

638
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,980
So did they have um,
an event like in terms of like a pathway

639
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:35,814
that you have to go through?

640
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,803
So it's um,
what's a world cup climbing breaks into 

641
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,344
three disciplines like lead climbing,
which is like a same as the indoor wall 

642
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:44,040
and then bouldering,
which is without a rope,

643
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,990
you know,
you just climbed 12 feet or whatever.

644
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,660
And then speed climbing where it's like 
a preset course.

645
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:51,040
Everyone does the exact same course 
where you just go as fast as you can and

646
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:51,874
just against the time.
And so normally those are three 

647
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:54,924
disciplines for the World Cup,
but the Olympic format combines all 

648
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:57,864
three into one competition because 
they're limited by how many metals and 

649
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,640
whatever,
because it's like a demonstration sport.

650
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,980
They're just sort of,
you know,

651
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,833
it's smaller scale than,
than some of the other sports in the 

652
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,100
Olympics.
But.

653
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:08,850
So,
um,

654
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,683
yeah,
so basically common competitors just 

655
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,530
have to do all three disciplines.
And See who wins.

656
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,520
I was watching something on youtube 
where they had this climbing competition

657
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:17,700
more.

658
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,930
They like ready,
set,

659
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,490
go.
And then they like shot up.

660
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,360
That's the speed coming.
And this lady who's wearing a burka,

661
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,150
she,
she like famous or something.

662
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,751
No,
I don't know.

663
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:28,584
But um,
but there are a bunch of really strong 

664
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:33,300
Iranian speed climbers and so I wouldn't
be surprised if,

665
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,950
if,
uh,

666
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,760
it's part of that,
ah,

667
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,180
she ran up at like a spider was crazy to
watch yet for whatever reason,

668
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,950
speak something is really big in eastern
Europe.

669
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,770
And then there are a couple of really 
good Iranian speed commerce and um,

670
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,653
yeah,
they're just,

671
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,513
it's like it's sort of,
it's own little niche sport coming out 

672
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:49,524
of certain parts of the world that is.
Well there's some strong genes over 

673
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,410
there and around like a lot of great 
wrestlers because,

674
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,244
I dunno,
I dunno if the woman you're talking 

675
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:56,874
about is from there.
I'm thinking of one specific dude who's 

676
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,600
so much his portrait in speed,
Iranian Foreign Nas.

677
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,670
Spell that as my.
Is I there?

678
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,220
I think you've pretty much got that.
Yeah.

679
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,480
What I want to see the video that I want
to see you find the video of her because

680
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,460
she's a fucking spider man.
Runs up the side of that hill.

681
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,910
He's going to browse the Internet.
Yes.

682
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:28,920
He could find her anyway.
But so with the,

683
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,870
uh,
with the new Olympic style climate,

684
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:31,704
I mean,
obviously there'll be drug tested with 

685
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,030
world cup is drug testing,
but it's funny with the.

686
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,290
But nobody really uses performance 
enhancing drugs.

687
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,390
I don't think they have legs one.
Fear enough.

688
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,303
I'm good.
Thank you.

689
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,243
One a one world cup climber had a metal 
taken away for having used a 

690
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,770
recreational cocaine.
And he was like,

691
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:47,830
Oh,
I'm really sorry.

692
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:48,340
Uh,
you know,

693
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,890
I'm sorry I did coke.
But he was like,

694
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:51,840
it was more for the partying and the 
performance,

695
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:52,680
you know,
she is.

696
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,460
Look at her place.
I mean,

697
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,440
for a guy like you,
is that impressive?

698
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,390
Like what?
See that play that from the beginning,

699
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,173
does it?
That's,

700
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,230
that's pretty fast.
That's not as fast.

701
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:05,064
I mean,
if you watch some of the more lead 

702
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:07,224
times,
it's,

703
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,600
it's faster for sure.
Um,

704
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,450
women or men?
Both,

705
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,350
I think.
I don't think that's true in that.

706
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,970
I think so.
I don't know.

707
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,210
Wow.
I don't know man.

708
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,103
Well,
you're,

709
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
you're the guy who would know to me.
That's damn impressive.

710
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,330
Just look up a world record.
I mean,

711
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,350
I think the male record is like five 
point seven seconds,

712
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,270
six seconds.
It's like something really,

713
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:28,290
really fast.
Now.

714
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,650
Do they know this path in advance?
Yeah.

715
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,000
So that's exactly the same route for 
everybody.

716
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,280
Always same distance,
same holds.

717
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,423
Um,
and so you basically memorize the 

718
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:39,390
sequence and then you just perform it as
fast as you can.

719
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,010
So here we go.
Here's the world record as this.

720
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,053
So you stand on that thing and the timer
starts when your one foot comes off the 

721
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,030
timer on the ground and then it ends.
When you slap the thing on the top.

722
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,960
Oh my God.
Yeah.

723
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,850
Look at that five point.
Whatever seconds.

724
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,770
Oh my God.
That doesn't look real.

725
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,880
It doesn't look like he's just running 
on the sidewalk.

726
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,320
Just tilted the camera and they're,
they're faking it.

727
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,580
Yeah.
For the camera.

728
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:09,940
Yeah.
No,

729
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,470
it's totally.
Now,

730
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,770
do these guys free solo or they,
they specifically concentrate on.

731
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,830
Imagine if you were free,
so like,

732
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,310
like this,
you would die for sure.

733
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,683
Know that Beta blockers would be 
something that someone who free Solos 

734
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,630
would want to look into.
I don't even know yet.

735
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:29,110
I don't know that it was Beta blockers 
or something that blocks your,

736
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,820
your brain's production of adrenaline.
Oh,

737
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,880
but I mean,
I don't know if you'd want that though,

738
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:34,714
because the thing is if you have an 
adrenaline spike it's because something 

739
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:38,290
weird went on and you probably want to.

740
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,323
Like I've had A.
I've had a couple times where I broke a 

741
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:41,914
hold off or something.
Like all of a sudden your whole drips 

742
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:43,864
off and then you have that like 
superhuman surgery and you grabbed back 

743
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:47,711
on.
Yeah.

744
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,270
You don't want to be mellow at that 
time.

745
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,871
Yeah,
exactly.

746
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:50,704
You don't want to be like,
I'm so relaxed as I fall all the way to 

747
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:54,100
the valley floor.
You know?

748
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,250
It's like you want to fricking hold on.
One of the things in the film was one of

749
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:59,890
the guys who fell and I guess eventually
died.

750
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,920
He was doing it.
He fell and base jumped.

751
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,843
Yeah.
With a parachute.

752
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,013
He called it freebasing.
He sort of pioneered the sport as a 

753
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:11,050
word,
but they're usually a good thing to have

754
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:12,460
on your back.
Well,

755
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:14,110
not really.
So yeah,

756
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:16,520
I mean the idea makes sense that if 
you're going to fall off a cliff,

757
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,363
have a parachute.

758
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,580
The thing is that you need to be on a 
very specific kind of cliff,

759
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:22,420
like what he was on,
where it was overhanging so that when he

760
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:25,150
fell he cleared the wall and he floated 
out into space.

761
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,343
But the thing is when you send money,
all the walls are slightly less than 

762
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:28,564
vertical in general.
And so it means that you just tumbled 

763
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:31,950
down the wall,
you know?

764
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,780
And the other thing is that even if you 
have a parachute,

765
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,620
parachutes function as a.
When you have a direction to them,

766
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,800
like Eric comes into them and you fly in
a direction which means that you have to

767
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:42,634
be facing away from the wall.
When you opened your parachute or else 

768
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:46,090
you just fly right into the wall and 
crash.

769
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,003
Yeah.
So it basically means that if you fall 

770
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:49,444
off unexpectedly,
you then have to track away from the 

771
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:51,580
wall.

772
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,020
Write yourself in mid air,
you know,

773
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,450
correct for everything and then make 
sure you're facing the right way.

774
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,813
And he was like,
basically there's a lot of things that 

775
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,990
have to go right for the parachute to 
help you.

776
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,590
But no,
that's not good.

777
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Yeah,
I mean it's one of,

778
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,080
a lot of people ask that.
They're like,

779
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:06,130
oh,
why don't you wear a parachute?

780
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:06,964
And you're like,
well it's basically this 10 pound 

781
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:10,000
training weight that doesn't really help
you much with that guy.

782
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:11,710
Just jumped on purpose.
Yeah,

783
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:12,461
this is.
Oh,

784
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:14,380
well,
yeah.

785
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,450
So it's good.
So this is on the Uyghur though,

786
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,650
it looks like,
I think.

787
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,420
Um,
and you can.

788
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,250
Yeah.
So he's like jumping away.

789
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:24,970
He's getting a nice controlled opening.
He's like flying away from the cliff.

790
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,590
It's like everything is going right for 
them.

791
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,723
But imagine if one of his foot holes 
just broke and he started pinwheel and 

792
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:31,870
down the wall it's like you'd never get 
the separation from the wall.

793
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,893
Disaster like was just watch extreme 
sports videos and I'll just commentate 

794
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,203
on them because were like all,
well this guy is surely going to have a 

795
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:43,150
disaster.
Well,

796
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,013
one of the things from the video when 
they were talking about all the people 

797
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:49,010
that have died,
that every,

798
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,113
essentially everyone from the past that 
was a free solar is dead and you're 

799
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:55,670
saying there's other things that they 
were doing,

800
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,310
like base jumping,
like base jumping and,

801
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,061
and,
and even,

802
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,490
there are a couple of older soloists,
I mean in the film,

803
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,480
uh,
Peter Croft,

804
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,780
who's like a legendary soloist and he 
was a childhood hero of mine and he's,

805
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,940
you know,
I don't want to say pushing 66.

806
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm not sure how old Peter is,
but he's,

807
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,190
you know,
he's an older,

808
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:12,120
he's a distinguished gentleman and he's 
uh,

809
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,330
he's living in the eastern Sierra.
He's climbing all the time.

810
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,163
He's like loving life with his wife and 
actually he's in Greece on a sport 

811
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:20,420
climbing vacation right now.
I'm just climbing for two months,

812
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,790
just fun climbing with a rope,
having a great time.

813
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,073
And so,
you know,

814
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,300
I look at somebody like Peter and he,
he was free soloing at,

815
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,180
at the very cutting edge for 20 years 
basically.

816
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,660
And it's still just a happy climate now,
but does he free solo anymore?

817
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:35,240
It just climbs well.
So it's funny.

818
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,550
I had dinner with him a couple of years 
ago and I was like,

819
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:38,384
oh Peter,
at what point did you quit soloing at 

820
00:33:39,571 --> 00:33:40,760
sort of an elite level,
you know,

821
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,440
like when did you sort of back off the 
grids?

822
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:43,274
And he was like,
well actually I did want to technically 

823
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,180
by the numbers I did one of my hardest 
free solos couple of years ago.

824
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,283
Um,
but it was like a sport route at his 

825
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:49,890
local Craig.

826
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,310
So like a route that he routinely climb 
for fitness.

827
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,230
They just happened to be a pretty hard 
number,

828
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
you know,
like climate grades are all sorted,

829
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,190
categorized.
And so you use like.

830
00:33:58,191 --> 00:33:59,510
Yeah,
technically one of my hardest solos.

831
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:00,344
It was just recently,
but it's like a hard number but not 

832
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:03,404
nearly as much of an undertaking as some
of the big solos that he'd done in the 

833
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:06,614
past.
Like some of the walls that he had at 

834
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,590
any 70 back in the day,
you know.

835
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:10,970
And so he was like,
oh,

836
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,980
it's all just kind of how you define 
difficulty,

837
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,620
you know.
Now when,

838
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,290
when you say that there's a number 
system that sort of rates what,

839
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,950
like how difficult a free Solo Path is?
Well,

840
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:22,784
no,
the rates climbing in general with a 

841
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,330
rope or without a rope is just,
it just rates how hard our climate is.

842
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,830
What is El Cap was?
So the route that I climbed is 5:12

843
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,690
d for whatever that means,
or maybe it's 13,

844
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:36,050
eight depending on how you,
depending on what you want to call it.

845
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,820
But um,
what does that mean?

846
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,733
Yeah,
exactly.

847
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,530
So the climbing,
climbing grades are defined,

848
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,690
I don't know.
So in America it's by the,

849
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:46,524
you many decimal system and it's a 
classification of terrain from one to 

850
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,550
one to six decibels decimal decimal 
system,

851
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:54,500
you know?
Yes.

852
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,483
But it's,
it's other parts of the world have 

853
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,184
different systems.
And like I'm in Australia is just an 

854
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,590
open ended numbers from one to 38 or 
something.

855
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,730
Whereas they get progressively harder.
Oh,

856
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:06,950
there it is right here,
right there.

857
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,510
Yeah.
Climbing grade comparison.

858
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,630
Oh,
that's interesting to one.

859
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,473
They all do it differently.
It was because climbing culture grew up 

860
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,430
in all different parts of the world.

861
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,353
Right.
And climbing culture I guess is a big 

862
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,770
part of Yosemite yet.
Well,

863
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,663
yeah.
I mean climbing as a sport in the US is 

864
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,074
sort of birthed from you somebody,
I mean the history of albinism or 

865
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:32,450
climate rock climbing anyway.
Certainly comes from you.

866
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:35,780
Somebody in the US.
Is it just because the paths are so cool

867
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:38,880
that it just drew people to it or.
Yeah,

868
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,631
partially.
I mean,

869
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:40,464
yeah,
the summits are so striking and I think 

870
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,960
a lot of it also just had to do with,
um,

871
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,463
just culture because a big part of it 
was people from La and the bay area who 

872
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,560
probably had some sense of classical 
albinism from the Alps,

873
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:53,394
you know,
people who have traveled to some extent 

874
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:58,170
and then wanted to climb other mountains
and then they happen to live near one of

875
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,210
the most iconic areas in the world.

876
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,050
And so then,
I don't know.

877
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,393
But anyway,
so it winds up being called the 

878
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,920
ascending decimal system.
But um,

879
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,600
but yeah,
so basically it's the,

880
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,910
the,
it's categories of terrain,

881
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:12,240
so one being walking on a normal trail 
to being like scrambling a little bit,

882
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:14,550
three being like scrambling with your 
hands and feet up,

883
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,643
you know,
rocks and then fourth class being like 

884
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,450
sorta like climbing but easier and then 
fifth class being actual rock climbing.

885
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,703
And so then it was five point one 
through nine depending on how hard 

886
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:27,500
things are,
you know,

887
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,860
so five point,
one being pretty easy,

888
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:29,694
five point nine being pretty hard,
like you're rock climbing now and 

889
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,513
technical and then at a certain point 
that system wasn't adequate so they had 

890
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:37,340
to start adding,
you know,

891
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,173
fivepoint 10 and then they subdivided 
into Abcd and then five point 11 abcd 

892
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,104
and the five point 12.

893
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,093
And so now it's an open ended system 
that right now goes up to five slash 16 

894
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:47,800
basically.
Whoa.

895
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,410
El Cap is really complicated.
Yeah.

896
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:55,411
But so el Cap is 12 d or five point 12 d
or maybe five point 13 eight,

897
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,140
which is the next grade up.
Um,

898
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,120
it's all sorted,
but,

899
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:02,730
so basically that means that it's,
it's elite.

900
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,130
Like that's very difficult and something
that like a,

901
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,143
obviously an average person can do,
but it's definitely not close to the 

902
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,680
physical limit of what's been done in 
the world.

903
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:11,883
Uh,
but that's with a rope on and that's 

904
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:13,854
after you know,
years of practice and what's the 

905
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,490
physical limit,
like what is the peak of where right now

906
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:21,630
the hardest grade in the world is 15 d,
which is extremely hard.

907
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:22,411
I mean,
it's totally crazy,

908
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:23,244
but so one guy,
this guy has done one route that he 

909
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:28,620
called 15 d and so it hasn't been 
repeated so it's not like an established

910
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,454
consensus,
but there are several 15 seas in the 

911
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,810
world and there are many 15 bees in the 
world.

912
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,860
Whereas this 15 d,
it's in a cave in Norway.

913
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,743
I mean it's,
um,

914
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,690
yeah,
that's the kind of the interesting thing

915
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:43,524
about climbing grades and climbing 
difficulties that they're all spread 

916
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:46,824
around the world,
the very specific clips because it 

917
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:51,150
requires just the right combination of,
of angle and holds,

918
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,343
you know,
there have to be enough things to hold 

919
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,860
onto,
but not too many else.

920
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,703
It's easier.
And so I for an elite climber and 

921
00:37:58,341 --> 00:37:59,760
they're basically searching the world 
all the time,

922
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,980
trying to find that right mixture of,
of rock.

923
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,320
Wow.
What a strange existence.

924
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,030
It's really,
really nice.

925
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,910
Yachts forgot.
Unusual now when you hear about it,

926
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,350
but it's also kind of elemental in a 
way,

927
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:11,184
you know,
because rocks are just out there and 

928
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:13,644
you're basically just going and 
exploring nature until you find the 

929
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,090
right kind of challenge.
What?

930
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:17,491
Yeah.
There's.

931
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,324
Got It.
There's some sort of a primal 

932
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:21,090
satisfaction that comes from climbing 
something,

933
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:21,510
right?

934
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,160
Yeah.
Wow.

935
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,490
There's a certain.
Yeah,

936
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:25,260
there's an elemental quality for sure.
Where you're like,

937
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,300
this is something that just exists in 
the world.

938
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,080
And you just say you have this,
this,

939
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,053
this,
this,

940
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,030
this is Adam,
Andrea,

941
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,110
this check kid climbing,
15 odd commander coming out about it,

942
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:34,560
I guess.
No,

943
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,280
it's already out.
It's,

944
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,630
it's a short online actually.
Silence.

945
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,100
Yeah.
The route he put up,

946
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:40,420
he called silence.
But uh,

947
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,520
if this is the film,
just scrub all the way to the.

948
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,593
Oh,
that's the.

949
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,183
Yeah.
So you can see he's climbing feet first 

950
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,340
through some of it and it's totally 
extreme.

951
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:50,370
It's so this Guy Adam,
Andrea is,

952
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,660
is for sure the strongest climber in the
world right now.

953
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,160
Like physical?
Yeah.

954
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,090
Physically.
So He's,

955
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:57,940
he put up the world's first 15 c and the
first 15 d,

956
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,803
so he's basically push the edge of 
difficulty for the last several grades 

957
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,840
and he's just freakishly strong.

958
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,820
Is that something that you would have to
be to do what he's doing?

959
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:11,530
Like A,
a regular climber?

960
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:14,290
Couldn't do what he's doing is almost 
like acrobatic involved.

961
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,030
Yeah,
we look at what he's doing right there.

962
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,303
It's like,
oh,

963
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,630
that's.
So this is the world's first 15.

964
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:21,430
See?
So slightly easier.

965
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,500
He did this several years ago,
but it's like,

966
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,390
um,
and then here I'm like,

967
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,980
yeah,
but that's where he has a rope,

968
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:27,814
you know,
and you trust that over and over and 

969
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:30,400
over.
But yeah,

970
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,690
he's,
he's an amazing climber.

971
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:33,460
He's really,
he's like a polymath.

972
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:36,220
He's like,
he's graded every discipline.

973
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,240
What else does he do?
Well,

974
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,020
so he.
Have you heard at the dawn wall on Ocap?

975
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,990
No,
I'm so Tommy Caldwell.

976
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,880
You know who he is.
Another professional climber.

977
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,930
Um,
he's,

978
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,610
he's,
he was,

979
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,450
I don't know.
Yeah,

980
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,820
he's basically one of America's best 
climbers.

981
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,100
He did this route called the dawn wall,
um,

982
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,993
which is also a film in theaters or 
wasn't theaters last month is sort of 

983
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:01,060
random that to big con and films came 
out exactly the same time,

984
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:02,410
but it was just one of those freak 
things.

985
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,573
But so the dawn wall was considered the 
hardest climb in the world to some 

986
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,140
extent.
It's this thing,

987
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:10,870
it was a seven year project for him up 
up the right side of El Cap.

988
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:12,420
The thing I climbed on the left side.
Oh Kathy,

989
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,410
he comes something on the right side,
which is much harder,

990
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,930
but he was using a rope and put seven 
years of work into it.

991
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,550
And um,
anyway,

992
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,540
years.
Yeah.

993
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,820
And then this Guy Adam,
100 who were watching a video of,

994
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:22,180
he,
uh,

995
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,013
he did the second ascent and uh,
he put like a month of work into it and 

996
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,610
repeated it and you're just like,
whoa,

997
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:28,750
he's really,
really strong.

998
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,853
Wow.
So when you see a guy do something like 

999
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:33,454
that,
does that make you think about doing it 

1000
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,543
or do you go,
well that's only something that someone 

1001
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,670
can do with raw.
With ropes.

1002
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,420
Oh yeah.

1003
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,253
No,
I mean there are whole categories of 

1004
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:43,684
climate that can only be done with a 
rope because the moves are way too 

1005
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,650
insecure.
You fall off way too often.

1006
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,900
I mean anything that kind of fall off 
doing that.

1007
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,760
Oh,
like hundreds or maybe even thousands of

1008
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:54,190
times.
So for him to,

1009
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,520
for him to do something at the heart,
I mean to,

1010
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,430
to climb at the very highest levels of,
of human potential.

1011
00:41:02,431 --> 00:41:03,264
I mean,
so think about a gymnast or something 

1012
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,790
that him right there.
So He's free soloing?

1013
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:07,121
No,
no,

1014
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,080
no.
He has a harness on.

1015
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,120
He's got a rope right there.
Yeah.

1016
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:13,210
No,
I mean look at what he's holding his one

1017
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:14,150
finger.
No,

1018
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,810
I think is the other one might be onto 
but,

1019
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,770
but it's basically like a tiny,
tiny,

1020
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:18,604
tiny edge.
This is the crux of one of the pitchers 

1021
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:20,830
on the dawn wall.

1022
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,663
That is so insane.
That guy could probably crush your head 

1023
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,660
by just grabbing it when certainly the,
he has a certain ferocity,

1024
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:31,660
he has an intensity where you can try 
with like 115 percent just like,

1025
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:32,494
ah.
So I'm pretty sure if he grabbed your 

1026
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:34,214
head and I tried as hard as it would 
just pop like a little melon grip 

1027
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:41,210
strength.
He's holding on to such a tiny,

1028
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:42,830
tiny little things.
Yeah,

1029
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:43,850
he's a,
he's a very,

1030
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:48,020
very strong wow man.
So a guy like that,

1031
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,913
when you see him do these paths,
these paths or paths that you can only 

1032
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:54,170
do with a rope?
Yeah.

1033
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,540
Yeah.
Does he free solo as well?

1034
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,010
I don't think he ever has,
but it's not really his thing.

1035
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:01,963
And the thing that in some ways it's 
really hard to do both at a high level 

1036
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,930
and um,
I,

1037
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,170
I think or at least to some extent it's 
hard to do both at a high level because.

1038
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,380
So for him,
for him to climb something that hard,

1039
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,410
he needs that intensity.
He needs a 115 percent effort.

1040
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,573
But if you're trying to free Solo,
well you definitely should never be 

1041
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:22,970
giving anything even remotely close to 
115 percent effort or will die for sure.

1042
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,943
Yeah.
Because you're so close to that razor 

1043
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,600
edge of failure when you're trying that 
hard.

1044
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,063
But with freestyle and you have to 
always keep it sort of within your 

1045
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,610
comfort zone because you don't want to 
die doing it.

1046
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,540
So I mean,
I think that I've always sort of kept my

1047
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,613
personal,
like you're on your personal barometer 

1048
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:40,520
of effort.
I sort of live between four and seven,

1049
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:41,354
let's say,
or like three and a half and seven 

1050
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:45,650
maybe.
Where it's like you're never too relaxed

1051
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,513
but you're also never going to the 
absolute death or sort of like in the 

1052
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,060
four to six is a sweet spot where you're
like,

1053
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,560
I'm climbing,
I'm having a good time.

1054
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,880
But I'm not like trying too hard and I'm
not relaxed.

1055
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,093
But.
So somebody gotta monitor or Tommy 

1056
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,080
Caldwell,
like I've,

1057
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,560
I've climbed with Tommy a lot over the 
years.

1058
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,620
He's a great climber and I've really 
seen this because he had like,

1059
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,690
I've seen him just randomly fall off 
many times because he was,

1060
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,840
he just slept.
He was like,

1061
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:07,700
Oh,
I'm so relaxed.

1062
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:08,690
It's so easy.
And then it's like,

1063
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,553
oh,
I slipped and that's kind of like an 

1064
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:13,090
effort of one where you're like,
your body is so relaxed that if,

1065
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,450
if anything happens,
then you fall and with,

1066
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,580
with a rope on,
that's fine.

1067
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:19,750
In some ways that's the more efficient 
way to climb because you know,

1068
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,623
you're so relaxed most of the time that 
you're saving a lot of energy over all 

1069
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:24,110
that every once in a while when you 
fall.

1070
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:24,741
It's like,
who cares?

1071
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:25,460
The rope catches you.

1072
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,293
It's no problem,
but you have to trust those little 

1073
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:30,080
things that you stick in the crowd.
But that's all.

1074
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,400
So that's,
I mean,

1075
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:31,791
that's.
Yeah,

1076
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:32,570
that's,
that's kind of like,

1077
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,360
what is he doing there?
He's uh,

1078
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,280
he's counter pressure me his leg into 
this cracked arrest.

1079
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,620
He's basically like pushing his knee 
into the rock to,

1080
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:40,454
uh,
in order to relax his arms from his 

1081
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:44,290
whole body leaning backwards.
Yes.

1082
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,124
So he's hanging upside down.
Basically every muscle in his body is 

1083
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:47,474
relaxed except for his calf and his calf
is forcing his knee into the rock which 

1084
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:50,834
holds them in place.

1085
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,743
That is so insane.
That photo is so insane that that's a 

1086
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:58,850
really efficient way to rest,
to rest,

1087
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,750
to rest.
Your arms will be good.

1088
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,960
It's really hard to.
Well,

1089
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,593
you know what I mean?
For him it's like for him to be able to 

1090
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:07,304
rest like that for one minute is an 
amazing way to rest your arms for a 

1091
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:12,200
minute and then it sort of saps your 
core and it makes us cap really tired.

1092
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:14,480
Obviously.
Now there's a guy like,

1093
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,270
does he lift weights or anything to 
prepare for these things?

1094
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,010
There's just no,
he's doing it.

1095
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:20,390
He's,
he's on his own program,

1096
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,503
but it's really climate specific.
He's mostly doing things with his 

1097
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,000
fingers and yeah,
he's pretty jacked.

1098
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,530
Is that even him?
That's crazy.

1099
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,380
That's a weird.
Uh,

1100
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,331
yeah,
it's the same.

1101
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,530
It's the same route.
That's interesting.

1102
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,100
I've never seen that photo,

1103
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,413
but I mean,
I guess you just get jacked from doing 

1104
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:37,590
that too though.
Just constantly pulling yourself up.

1105
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,790
Yeah,
for sure.

1106
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,863
There's a climbing wall just like local 
a kid's place and I told my daughter 

1107
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:46,950
give her 100 bucks if she could make it 
all the way to the other side.

1108
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,653
It's pretty difficult and so she's 
become obsessed with trying to get over 

1109
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:54,450
that to get 100 bucks.
That's definitely Jack.

1110
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:55,770
I mean look at it.
He's Jack.

1111
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,570
Your daughter's going to wind up super 
ripped.

1112
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,660
It's hard to do my like really?
I tried to do it and I couldn't do it.

1113
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:01,261
I was like,
wow,

1114
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:03,810
this is really hard.
It's difficult to do.

1115
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,070
I bet.
I bet if you.

1116
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:05,904
If you try it a bit.
I mean just because you have such a 

1117
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:08,820
background in movement and fitness and 
everything.

1118
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:10,170
I bet.
I bet it wouldn't be that hard for,

1119
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:11,760
you know,
instruction.

1120
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,560
Yeah.
I'm pretty heavy though.

1121
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:18,480
For someone who's short the that'd be an
issue is hanging on $200.

1122
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,140
So in theory climbing should be more in 
your legs anyway.

1123
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:24,030
She'd be driving with your legs because 
no matter what,

1124
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:26,490
your legs are always bigger and stronger
muscles in your arms.

1125
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,493
So that's always what drives you upward 
and then your arms should only be 

1126
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:31,014
holding your weight in and keeping your,
keeping you balanced over your feet 

1127
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,800
basically.
That's interesting.

1128
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:35,634
That's something that they figured out 
fairly recently with grappling over the 

1129
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,653
last 10,
15 years with Jujitsu and things along 

1130
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,000
those lines that your legs,
you,

1131
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,230
it's really important to use mostly your
legs when you're grappling.

1132
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,370
Totally.
I can see that.

1133
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,204
I mean that's what's driving you forward
and pushing the whole trolling your 

1134
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:55,320
opponent and manipulating your opponent 
and doing stuff with your legs.

1135
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,450
Do you do anything to cross train?

1136
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,250
Like not really,
no other mountain sports,

1137
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:04,380
a little mountain biking or skiing or 
things like that.

1138
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,420
We do it for fun,
for fun.

1139
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,553
And then um,
the only real cross training and it was 

1140
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,690
just sort of like a pushup and core type
routine,

1141
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,873
you know,
like opposition training just to 

1142
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,950
maintain healthy,
healthy body.

1143
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,750
Oh,
because you're constantly pulling.

1144
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,351
Yeah,
exactly.

1145
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:20,184
I'm always pulling for my sports.
So then I tried to do a little bit of 

1146
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:24,420
pushing and core just to make sure that 
things stay balanced out.

1147
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,550
Now,
is that something you talk to a physical

1148
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,260
therapist about or.
No,

1149
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:30,750
that's just.
I mean that's just basic physiology.

1150
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,584
I mean if you only pull,
you have to push sometimes throws you 

1151
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:35,790
wind up all imbalanced and injured.
Well,

1152
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,663
I saw the,
one of the things in the film was when 

1153
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:41,250
you were recovering from your ankle 
sprain and you know,

1154
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:44,340
you had said that you really hadn't been
injured in years.

1155
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,210
Then all of a sudden you have this 
girlfriend and she doesn't climb and you

1156
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:50,340
get injured.
Yeah.

1157
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,700
Yeah.
That actually is just free.

1158
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,110
Free timing.
God luck.

1159
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,953
Yeah.
It's just unfortunate because I think 

1160
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:56,814
really it just shows that I've been 
really fortunate for 20 years that I've 

1161
00:46:58,591 --> 00:47:01,130
had very few injuries climbing and then,
you know,

1162
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,090
at some point you just have a few in 
this.

1163
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,260
I mean that's just life to some extent,
but when you do have something like that

1164
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:10,350
and you feel sort of the vulnerability 
of your tissue and your,

1165
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,140
do you think about like,
Hey,

1166
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:18,141
what if this happened halfway up?
Some fucking insane path?

1167
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,091
No,
the,

1168
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:20,920
the bigger thing in the film,
uh,

1169
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,754
I have a back injury earlier where I get
lowered off the end of the rope and 

1170
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:26,280
fall.
I only fell maybe 10 or 12 feet,

1171
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:27,510
you know,
sorta like the height of this,

1172
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,530
this room basically.

1173
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,823
And,
but I landed sort of like folded over 

1174
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:33,400
this rock backward.
It was like totally horrible,

1175
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:36,670
like these jagged good boulders and um,
so I didn't go that far,

1176
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,590
but I was like,
oh,

1177
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:39,424
you know,
I got worked and it was really sobering 

1178
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,240
because it made me realize that if I 
fell from 40 feet climbing,

1179
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,380
you know,
you could,

1180
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,370
it could be.
Yeah,

1181
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:50,680
I mean it'd be a disaster.
You're basically are,

1182
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,050
it made me realize just how fragile my 
body is because I'm like,

1183
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:53,884
oh,
I only fell a little tiny ways and it 

1184
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,720
really hurt pretty bad.
I was like,

1185
00:47:58,721 --> 00:47:59,710
man,
if you fell much further,

1186
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:00,544
you could,
you could,

1187
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,370
anything could happen.
Yeah.

1188
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,090
People step off stairs wrong and yeah.
Yeah.

1189
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,410
It's very strange.
The body's so fragile.

1190
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,370
It's really amazing.
Well,

1191
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,480
it's funny,
but it's so fragile.

1192
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:15,280
But then also so robust in some ways.

1193
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,113
I mean,
it's amazing what the human body can 

1194
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:19,450
adapt to or withstand,
but then yeah,

1195
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:21,370
and then some things just cannot.
Yeah.

1196
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:22,960
That's why I was asking you about your 
age,

1197
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:23,823
like as you get older,
are you seeing a difference in the way 

1198
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,124
you recover?
Are you seeing differences in the way 

1199
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,480
you know,
like what your body,

1200
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,480
what you feel like your potential is?
I,

1201
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,130
yeah.
It's hard to say.

1202
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:36,964
I think.
Um,

1203
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:37,811
yeah.
I don't know.

1204
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,460
I mean those are the tough questions.
I mean,

1205
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:40,120
you know,
I'm sure.

1206
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,170
Sure you think about this stuff too.
Was a fighter a fighter at your age?

1207
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,400
Thirty three?
He said.

1208
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,333
Yeah.
That's when you start tailing off like 

1209
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:51,100
winding down 34,
35 on a fighter,

1210
00:48:51,101 --> 00:48:53,050
hits like 36.
Like yikes.

1211
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,610
Is that,
is that like old for fighter?

1212
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,910
That's pretty old.
It's very rare.

1213
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,833
There's only a few guys who've been able
to compete at a world class level past 

1214
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:02,140
that.

1215
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,170
And MMA.
Randy coture stands out and boxing.

1216
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,040
Bernard Hopkins stands out.
How old is the Floyd Mayweather?

1217
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,710
He's 40.
Wow.

1218
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,660
Is he still considered like fighting an 
elite level?

1219
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,771
Well,
you know,

1220
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:15,604
when he fought conor mcgregor,
conor mcgregor was nowhere near his 

1221
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:20,440
level because conor mcgregor wasn't 
really a box.

1222
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:24,160
He's on boxer and so floyd just kind of 
worked him.

1223
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,200
But uh,
he hasn't really fought at a world class

1224
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:32,000
level for a couple of years because,
you know,

1225
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,063
he beat Canelo Alvarez several years ago
and made Canelo drop a ton of weight 

1226
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,503
when he beat Manny Pacquiao.
Manny Pacquiao was quite a bit past his 

1227
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:40,384
prime and had a shoulder injury.
So you probably dealing with like three 

1228
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:48,340
years or so since he's fought like real 
world class competition.

1229
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,530
Huh?
When you say you made them drop lunch,

1230
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,190
wait,
does that mean like to.

1231
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,040
How does that work?
Clever.

1232
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:54,850
You know,
he,

1233
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:58,000
he wanted him to fight at a lower weight
class,

1234
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,430
you know,
because floyd really,

1235
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,920
floyd started off his career,
I want to say at 1:30.

1236
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,930
Then he fought at 1:45.
Yeah.

1237
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:07,030
And you know,
his real isn't any big.

1238
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,850
How big is it?
At least a very small five,

1239
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,810
six,
five,

1240
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,490
seven,
maybe five,

1241
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,610
seven.
Tiny little hands on.

1242
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,890
Very small hands.
But certainly they hit very hard.

1243
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,930
Well,
he's not a very fast,

1244
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:23,380
he's just a genius boxer.
Probably one of the best defense,

1245
00:50:23,381 --> 00:50:24,214
probably if not the best,
definitely top two or three boxers of 

1246
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:28,784
all time.
It's only been really hit hard to the 

1247
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:33,040
point where it's been wobbled like maybe
like four,

1248
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:33,883
four times his entire career.
It seems like that's the kind of box 

1249
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,950
that you want to be.
Exactly.

1250
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:40,760
You know what it'd be like the rocky 
Balboa styled,

1251
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,753
so that just gets beaten to death and 
then you want to be as boring really 

1252
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,190
frigging watching NFL games with good 
defense and you're like,

1253
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,053
oh man.
It's like not the team you want to 

1254
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:52,400
watch,
but it's probably the better team.

1255
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,413
Yeah,
well especially with boxing because the 

1256
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:58,670
consequences are so grave.
If you hit a lot,

1257
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,093
there was a horrible video that I put up
on youtube or on twitter rather than a 

1258
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:03,974
retweeted.
Someone sent me and it's boxers when 

1259
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:11,360
they're young talking versus after 
injuries and you're watching,

1260
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:12,710
you're like,
whoa.

1261
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,980
It's stunning.
It's just like nfl stuff too.

1262
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:17,170
I mean,
yeah,

1263
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,673
it's funny.
I mean people talk about that with 

1264
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:19,731
climbing.
It's like,

1265
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:20,870
oh,
that's such a dangerous sport,

1266
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:21,704
but the thing about rock climbing is 
that it's basically a completely safe 

1267
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:24,884
sport right up until some kind of 
accident may happen and then then you 

1268
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,573
potentially die.
But so the thing is you can basically 

1269
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:33,530
climb at a high level for 50 years and 
never have any issues or you could maybe

1270
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:34,364
die doing it,
but it's kind of a fundamentally safe 

1271
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:39,440
sport for the most part as opposed to 
what we're talking about,

1272
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:42,950
like fighting or a football or things 
like that were like,

1273
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:46,340
or even mountain biking where you're for
sure going to get injured like no matter

1274
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:47,630
what,
just by,

1275
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,340
just by playing the game,
you know,

1276
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,970
like football and fighting,
they creep up on you,

1277
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,250
like the injuries start to pile.

1278
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:58,790
But basically just even in practice you 
are getting injured constantly,

1279
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,660
you know?
And so it's,

1280
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,620
I mean that's Kinda messed up.
It's just the price of entry is going to

1281
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,780
be freaking head injuries.
Yeah.

1282
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:06,614
I went to a football game.
You have the day high school football 

1283
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,360
game.
And um,

1284
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,520
when I was there,
I,

1285
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,600
I had a really hard time watching it 
because everybody's cheering and um,

1286
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,950
and I was talking to my friend,
I'm like,

1287
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:17,560
you're looking at brain damage.
Yeah,

1288
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:18,543
no one's messed up here.
These kids are getting brain damage and 

1289
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,373
this is like a really nice private 
school where they pay a lot of money to 

1290
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:28,490
get the kids into this program.
And then the kids are playing football.

1291
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,980
I'm like,
these are all getting brain damage.

1292
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:31,701
He goes,
really?

1293
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:32,151
I go,
oh,

1294
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:32,981
100 percent.
I go,

1295
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:35,720
do you see that collision?
That's brain damage.

1296
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,420
That's definitely brain damage.
It might not be a lot.

1297
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,313
They might be okay,
but how many of those do they do in a 

1298
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,510
day?
How many do they do?

1299
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,370
How many a month?
How many are there?

1300
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,160
What are ways to human potential right 
there?

1301
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:46,910
I'm just like,
well,

1302
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,200
it really is.
I mean,

1303
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,950
the problem is it's such a grand part of
our history and our culture,

1304
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,290
which doesn't really need to be.
I mean,

1305
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,150
you know,
football hasn't existed that alarm.

1306
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:56,811
Yeah.
No,

1307
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:57,660
I agree.
I mean,

1308
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,990
I'm not,
I forgot.

1309
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,510
Shit,
I watched a Rodeo from like very,

1310
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:05,240
very close basically like from the 
commentators box,

1311
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:06,074
like above the pens for the fourth of 
July Rodeo in Wyoming like two summers 

1312
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,890
ago.
And that was something I was like,

1313
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:14,240
this is messed up.
I mean,

1314
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,083
and I'm not like huge animal rights guy 
but I'm vegetarian obviously and I sort 

1315
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:18,770
of care.
And I was like,

1316
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,491
Oh,
you know,

1317
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:22,000
you're kind of abusing these animals for
sport and that's like,

1318
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:26,270
that doesn't sit that well with me.
But what was even worse,

1319
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,153
I was like,
all these young men are getting worked 

1320
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,680
just like for the entertainment is 
totally like Roman gladiator type stuff.

1321
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:33,790
And I was just like.
And it's weird because it's so cultural,

1322
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:34,624
you know,
because,

1323
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,060
and,
and you know,

1324
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:36,894
I mean I can,
I can empathize because obviously I'm 

1325
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,990
doing something that's also sort of 
bloodsport he to some extent and,

1326
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,470
and sort of for the same reason,
you know,

1327
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,304
you're a teenage do look into do 
something interesting and engaging 

1328
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,530
that's,
that will hopefully get you laid,

1329
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,000
you know,
like you just want to.

1330
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:51,834
I mean,
if you're from small town Wyoming and 

1331
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:53,041
you're like,
oh,

1332
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:53,874
I'm good at riding bowls,
like that's for sure going to be your 

1333
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:57,000
path.
And I'm like,

1334
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:57,834
oh,
that's just too bad that that's your 

1335
00:53:58,411 --> 00:54:00,090
path.
It's a path.

1336
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,620
I mean we watched this guy get fricking 
thrown off this bowl and um,

1337
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,760
and I think he was fine,
you know,

1338
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,603
he landed on the ground,
but then the bowl for Canada was 

1339
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:10,290
charging him and the guy like,
I've never seen human terror,

1340
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,540
like he basically just turned and ran as
fast as he could,

1341
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,374
but he ran straight into this post,
like headfirst into this frickin steel 

1342
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:17,340
posts,
like the edge of the.

1343
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,170
Because he just didn't,
you know,

1344
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:20,004
it was like the bolts coming at him.
He like turns it around and you 

1345
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:23,790
basically like knocks himself out 
against this post.

1346
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,890
And thankfully the clowns distracted the
bowl.

1347
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:26,724
And then the paramedics,
he believed there was a brigade 

1348
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,350
ambulance basically parked on the other 
side of the fence from what you read do.

1349
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,453
And so they basically like lift him over
and put them straight on the stretcher 

1350
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,470
and take them away.
You know what I was like dude,

1351
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:39,180
and you know the crowds all like,
ah,

1352
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:42,030
and you're just like that guys like 
messed up like that,

1353
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,880
you know,
everything about it made me like,

1354
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,900
feel kind of gross,
you know?

1355
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,973
Yeah.
It's not like I would never want to pay 

1356
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:50,540
to watch somebody hurt themselves or 
just like,

1357
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,383
I dunno.
Well it's weird that that's culturally 

1358
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:55,500
acceptable,
but like bullfighting is not.

1359
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,750
Yeah.
When they're totally.

1360
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,530
Yeah.
Bull riding.

1361
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:00,590
It's like they're fricking tasing the 
bowls that are like,

1362
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,493
aren't they tying off their balls and 
they're doing all kinds of things and 

1363
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:03,914
some bad things too though.
People argue that the polls have great 

1364
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:06,780
lives,
you know,

1365
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,510
they feed them well and they get a lot 
of exercise and they're very happy bowls

1366
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:10,380
and you're like,
dude,

1367
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:12,690
I'm pretty sure they'd rather be roaming
the open plains,

1368
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:14,830
like inseminating cows,
you know?

1369
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,350
Yeah.
That's weird.

1370
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,640
Justification.
Yeah.

1371
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,690
We had a guy on fear factor

1372
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,533
for once that was a professional rodeo 
guy and his shoulder was like a 

1373
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:28,711
topographic map and he had so many scars
in his shoulder and he told me,

1374
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:29,614
you show that would just pop out just 
like he could just pop it out left and 

1375
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:33,214
right from just being destroyed like 
Ford by bolts falling and getting it 

1376
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,700
ripped apart or riding bowls.
Oh yeah.

1377
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,291
Yeah.
I just,

1378
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:43,390
I just don't get that just wasn't 
working anymore.

1379
00:55:43,391 --> 00:55:46,690
I mean he had a bunch of surgeries and 
they tried to screw it back together and

1380
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,300
tighten things down,
but it was just destroyed.

1381
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,460
So I'm sure.
I'm sure a bull rider would look at free

1382
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:52,294
soloing.
It'd be like,

1383
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,530
what a crazy dude.
You know,

1384
00:55:53,531 --> 00:55:55,050
everybody looks at another sport and 
they're like,

1385
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,893
that's great.
And honestly I look at fighting and I'm 

1386
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:58,180
like,
that seems totally outrageous.

1387
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,283
I'm like,
why would you want some other dude beat 

1388
00:56:00,071 --> 00:56:01,810
you to death in a cage?
I'm like,

1389
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,730
that's great.
He's outrageous.

1390
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,280
It is outrageous.
But if you can get good enough where you

1391
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:09,150
can avoid getting damage.
Yeah.

1392
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,510
And then the tool to land the damage,
it's Kinda the same,

1393
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:15,230
but even landing the damage to a certain
extent,

1394
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:15,611
you're like,
oh,

1395
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:17,800
you're hurting somebody else for the 
pleasure of the crowd.

1396
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:18,910
You're like,
that's Kinda messed up.

1397
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,580
You know,
it's a weird feeling.

1398
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,980
Knocking someone is one of the

1399
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,910
weirdest feelings because a part of you 
is happy that it's not you,

1400
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,953
but part of you is like looking down 
with that guy that's just got flatlined 

1401
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,480
and you're like,
Whoa,

1402
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,140
that could have been made.
How much to fighters?

1403
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:38,290
Like,
hold back,

1404
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,213
you know,
because I feel like you kind of have to 

1405
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:40,663
like go to the death.
But then if you actually like punch 

1406
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:43,810
somebody so hard,
they died or something.

1407
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:45,790
I mean obviously you'd feel horrible or 
it will.

1408
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,110
You don't look back at all.
But that's insane.

1409
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,750
But.
So it's like you don't hold back at all,

1410
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,450
but then if you actually killed somebody
when you feel horrible.

1411
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,810
It's very rare that someone dies in 
mixed martial arts,

1412
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:57,280
believe it or not.
Well yeah.

1413
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,290
No,
I mean I know that,

1414
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,850
but it's possible.
Definitely possible.

1415
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,480
And it has happened and it's sort of 
like it has happened very,

1416
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:06,670
very rarely in mixed martial arts.

1417
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,970
Never in the UFC.
But in boxing it happens more often.

1418
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,240
And one of the reasons why it happens 
more often in boxing because you're only

1419
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:16,510
punching in,
then you're taking people down.

1420
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,373
Yeah.
People are tapping out cause they're 

1421
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:19,030
paying them.
Well.

1422
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:21,790
It's also there's more options to defend
yourself.

1423
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,160
You're not just getting battered against
the ropes.

1424
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,203
They're also nowadays much better at 
stopping a fight when a fighter's 

1425
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,140
clearly compromised when they're.
They're really fucked up.

1426
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,350
In the old days they used to let guys 
just get battered.

1427
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,560
They're just a box that doesn't sit well
with me.

1428
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,680
I'm just like,
ah,

1429
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:40,563
but that's what I'm not a fighter.
Well that's the thing about climbing is 

1430
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:45,064
there's this real elemental appeal to 
just you and the mountain and it's 

1431
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:50,980
nature and it's beautiful and it's very 
peaceful and calm.

1432
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:51,814
It's like so different than having 
thousands of people screaming at you as 

1433
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:55,510
you punch someone in the face over and 
over.

1434
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,890
Just like,
dude,

1435
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,680
that's just not my scene.
Well,

1436
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:00,514
did you see the economy?
Mcgregor could be abnormal gromit off 

1437
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:04,870
fight where there's the big fight 
outside the cage.

1438
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,733
Always.
That's the thing where the guy vaults 

1439
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,590
out of the cage and like starts bawling.
I was like,

1440
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,480
yeah,
it's like wwe or whatever it was.

1441
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:11,743
When did they start breaking tables over
people crazier than that because it was 

1442
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,591
real.
Yeah,

1443
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,341
exactly.
I was like,

1444
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:16,174
this is totally outrageous,
but what's funny is it became chaos 

1445
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:24,871
because a fight erupted outside of the 
parameters of the fight.

1446
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:27,900
It was just more fighting,
fighting.

1447
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,550
You have like,
this is what we paid for,

1448
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:30,800
this isn't okay.
Right.

1449
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,130
Everybody's like fighting in the cage is
fine.

1450
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,380
This is lovely,
but because out of the cage,

1451
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:37,390
oh my God,
he's out in the wild.

1452
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,360
That's like out in the world fighting.
Isn't that kind of messed up?

1453
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:42,550
Yeah.
It's definitely like he's a professional

1454
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:43,384
fighter.
He's fighting.

1455
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,020
That's what he does.
It's weird though,

1456
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:48,970
the whole list and then this is coming 
from someone who's been involved in this

1457
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:50,170
my whole life.
It's weird.

1458
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,021
It's.
I,

1459
00:58:51,021 --> 00:58:51,854
I absolutely see all the arguments 
against it and yet you still want to go 

1460
00:58:55,711 --> 00:58:56,544
to trader when people in the face.
I don't punch anybody in the face 

1461
00:58:59,021 --> 00:59:00,820
anymore.
I still choke people.

1462
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,070
But uh,
I think that seems totally fun.

1463
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,630
The thing about the Jujitsu aspect of it
is you,

1464
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,850
you really can tap out and stop and you 
don't really get hurt.

1465
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,720
You get hurt training.
Jujitsu's accidental for the most part.

1466
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,230
Especially when you train,
you're actually better off training with

1467
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:19,810
a black belt than you are with a white 
belt doorway because.

1468
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:20,360
Yeah,
no,

1469
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,410
I get that blacks,
they have more control on,

1470
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,870
so they'll be fine with you.

1471
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,830
They'll just,
they'll just tap you and yeah,

1472
00:59:25,831 --> 00:59:27,830
it was a white ball accident and kicks 
you in the face and you're like,

1473
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,500
ah,
spark really strong.

1474
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:32,610
Especially if you get a white belt is a 
crossfitter,

1475
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,690
is fucking jacked.
Really strong guide.

1476
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:35,563
Just wants to.
They probably were just grappling and 

1477
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,260
then as a harm came out and I don't know
what to do with it,

1478
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:40,630
so I threw it away.
I don't know.

1479
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,553
Yeah.
Really unskilled guy who's extremely 

1480
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:45,980
strong,
who's learning technique,

1481
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,280
and it's also like a spazz is very 
dangerous to roll.

1482
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:50,310
Uh,
so yeah,

1483
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,163
you don't want to teach me to Jujitsu.
It's not me telling you if you did it 

1484
00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:55,694
with me we'd be fine.
But if you did it with someone who's a 

1485
00:59:57,381 --> 00:59:59,030
real beginner,
who's,

1486
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,760
you know what I'm saying?
I'm a strong beginner,

1487
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,160
strong grip and no idea what I'm doing.
Just like,

1488
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,310
yeah,
book.

1489
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,700
The real problem would be if we were 
both beginners yoga,

1490
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,563
that would be the real problem.
Like a strong spazz is not really not 

1491
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,550
going to work against the black belt.
That's a go.

1492
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,570
That's the learning curve for climate 
and who you don't want to.

1493
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,940
Beginners going out and trying to climb 
a mountain together.

1494
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,010
I would worry about that.
Like if you're climbing,

1495
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:28,970
do you ever climb?
Like is there a chain like one person in

1496
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:30,600
front of you?
Like when you.

1497
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,660
Yeah,
when you climb up the rope,

1498
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,523
it's basically two people.
One goes out first and then brings up 

1499
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:36,950
the second because you're limited by the
length of the rope.

1500
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:38,930
So basically one person,
because at the end of the rope brings up

1501
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:39,764
the next person,
that person that climbs through brings 

1502
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:41,804
it up the second,
so you dependent upon the holes that 

1503
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:47,720
they put in when they put those bolts 
into the cracks and bolts,

1504
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,700
bolts and things are put in by the first
essential list.

1505
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,830
So the very first person to have ever 
climbed the route,

1506
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,040
but then everybody thereafter is able to
just clip there.

1507
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:58,700
Their equipment into the bolts are a use
preestablished anchors,

1508
01:00:58,701 --> 01:00:59,540
things like that.
Oh.

1509
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:00,374
So all the,
all the roots are already established 

1510
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:04,640
and you can read a book that shows all 
the different routes.

1511
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,800
So like El captain has something like 
112 different roots of it and wow.

1512
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,023
And of those hundred and 12,
only 15 or so of them can be free 

1513
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,550
climbed,
which is different than free soloing.

1514
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:17,384
Free climbing,
meaning just using your hands and your 

1515
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:20,810
feet and you're still using a rope.
You're still clipping into protection as

1516
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:21,644
you go,
but you're only using your hands and 

1517
01:01:22,731 --> 01:01:25,640
your feet to get you up as opposed to 
like putting gear in.

1518
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:27,800
And then pulling on the gear which would
be considered cheating.

1519
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,053
So of the 100 routes on Ocap,
something like 90 of them you have to 

1520
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,553
pull on the hardware,
you have to like clip little ladders 

1521
01:01:34,761 --> 01:01:35,870
into it and step on,
you know,

1522
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,704
you have to hammer pecans in and then 
clip into them and stand on and then 

1523
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,410
hammer another town and step on.
That is no flip for.

1524
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:43,820
Yeah,
there's just nothing to hold onto.

1525
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:45,560
It's too hard.
So then,

1526
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:46,281
so then there,
yeah,

1527
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:49,130
something like 10 or 15 free climbing 
routes where you can climate.

1528
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,473
And so with my big goal of trying to 
free Solo El cap to climbing without a 

1529
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:53,984
rope,
I was limited to just those 10 or 15 

1530
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:58,550
routes that are possible to climb.
Just with your hands and feet.

1531
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,400
And how did you establish the one that 
you wanted to proceed on?

1532
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,413
Yeah,
so basically I just wanted them doing 

1533
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:08,120
the easiest one because I'm basically,
it's really hard to free climb El cap by

1534
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:08,954
any means.
And so the easiest one wound up being 

1535
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,620
the most secure.
The best one for me.

1536
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,693
How many people have done it?
Will Free Solo or free climb free solo 

1537
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:17,630
freestyle.
I'm,

1538
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,260
I mean,
nobody only web the only one.

1539
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,130
Yeah,
I mean that's why there's

1540
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,090
the film and everything.
It's,

1541
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:24,150
it's a.
and nobody's ever even thought about it,

1542
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:25,650
you know,
nobody's considered.

1543
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:28,050
It's not like something that people are 
trying to do.

1544
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,330
Now that you've done it.
Other,

1545
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,510
other people that are considering it.
I really don't.

1546
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:32,344
I mean,
I think it's almost more the opposite 

1547
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:33,930
now that I've done it.
People are like,

1548
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:35,850
Whoa,
I don't need to do that every.

1549
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:36,723
I mean,
there's nobody even playing this game 

1550
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:39,001
right now.
Really.

1551
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:41,130
There aren't that many high end free 
soloist right now.

1552
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:46,160
How many other um,
to one or something really.

1553
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,033
I mean,
I don't know.

1554
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:47,893
I don't know if there are any others 
really right now there's this guy brad 

1555
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:50,784
go right.
And then the American guy who's been 

1556
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,750
freestyling at a pretty high level,
but definitely he's a really good friend

1557
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:56,490
of mine,
so I'm not slandering him.

1558
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,271
But,
um,

1559
01:02:57,271 --> 01:02:59,460
but definitely at a very different level
than,

1560
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,420
than,
uh,

1561
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,790
like he would never even dream of 
selling all cab.

1562
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:05,870
So he's sort of starting out was not 
that he's starting out,

1563
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,713
I mean he's a very good climber,
he's been climbing with long time and 

1564
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:10,710
he's done all kinds of very difficult 
things.

1565
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:11,573
But in terms of free soloing,
I think he just doesn't need to push it 

1566
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,353
as that hard.
So he's almost like he dabbles in free 

1567
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:19,170
soloing.
Yeah.

1568
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,880
Well I mean I dabble on free soloing as 
well.

1569
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:24,780
I mean most of them I'm climbing with my
friends doing other things,

1570
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:25,883
you know,
I mean I think most almost all climbers 

1571
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:28,404
only dabbling free.
So free soloing is sort of like one 

1572
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:30,864
discipline of climbing.
Like when we were talking earlier about 

1573
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:33,810
the Olympics,
having multiple disciplines,

1574
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,203
um,
you know there are many types of 

1575
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:37,314
climbing and most climbers do all of 
them to some extent and free soloing 

1576
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:43,200
always represents sort of this small 
specialty like extra style.

1577
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,633
So you do free climbing and then you 
also do the kind of climbing where you 

1578
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:49,630
have to put in those posts and stand on 
them.

1579
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,600
Our aid climbing,
artificial climate.

1580
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,070
So I free climb,
I aid climb.

1581
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:55,120
Sometimes I don't like to because it's 
too much work,

1582
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,400
it's too much like construction,
you know,

1583
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:57,900
you're like nailing things and standing 
on.

1584
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:58,734
It's like engineering,
but I do that because sometimes that's 

1585
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:04,250
what it requires to get up big mountains
and we do that.

1586
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,360
And you nail things and stand on them.
Do you take them out as well?

1587
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,213
Yeah,
the second person takes them out so the 

1588
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:12,030
one person uses them to get up and then 
once the rope is security above,

1589
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,130
then the second person joins them and 
remove them all.

1590
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,143
And then you have all your gear back and
then you're able to do it again for the 

1591
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:17,340
next section.

1592
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,410
How much weight is that stuff?
Well,

1593
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:20,244
it depends where it can be a lot.
And certainly back in the day when 

1594
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:23,550
people were doing the first ascents of 
El Cap,

1595
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,700
I mean it's something like 40 pounds or 
50 pounds of iron hanging off him.

1596
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:27,773
Jesus.
Nowadays it's a lot lighter and you can 

1597
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:29,910
use better gear.
But um,

1598
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,320
but yeah,
I mean it's a lot,

1599
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:34,710
but that's kind of the appeal of free 
climbing or even free soloing means that

1600
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:36,270
you have nothing on you.
Now,

1601
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,660
how secure is that stuff that you're 
hammering in there?

1602
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,160
It depends.
It depends.

1603
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:41,994
I mean there's certainly stories of 
people falling and ripping all this 

1604
01:04:43,811 --> 01:04:45,290
stuff back up,
but,

1605
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:46,703
but,
but sometimes that's okay because if 

1606
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:48,594
you're,
if you're thousands of feet off the 

1607
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:50,154
ground,
you can take that hundred foot fall and 

1608
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,790
not touch anything and it's fun.
Oh yeah.

1609
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,820
But still not really earlier this 
summer,

1610
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,820
a county on the thing.

1611
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,180
Yeah,
I mean it's all,

1612
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,100
it's all well founded.
I mean,

1613
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:04,610
you just got to trust it.
Now,

1614
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,670
earlier this summer I was talking about 
Tommy Caldwell,

1615
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:09,420
one of the best climbers in the country.
So the two of us did the speed record on

1616
01:05:09,421 --> 01:05:10,254
ocap cap earlier this year.
And so that's the two of us are tied 

1617
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:13,380
together.
We're using a rope,

1618
01:05:13,381 --> 01:05:15,810
we're using equipment,
but we're anything goes,

1619
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:16,644
you're cheating as much as you can,
as it trying to get from the bottom of 

1620
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:18,994
the cap to the top as fast as possible.
This is on a different route than the 

1621
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:23,980
one that I presented in the film.
And so,

1622
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,373
um,
we were trying to go sub two hours and 

1623
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:27,790
we ultimately did it and 1:58
and it was,

1624
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,560
it was pretty awesome and we were really
psyched.

1625
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:32,410
But along the way Tommy took 100 foot 
fall at one point where he just,

1626
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,340
I was talking about him with the whole 
one to 10 effort.

1627
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,173
He was climbing something that's really,
really easy and he was probably giving 

1628
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,960
an effort of like two and he just 
slipped,

1629
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:41,980
you know,
and I was like,

1630
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,820
oh,
but anyway,

1631
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:43,654
he freakin whipped.
You felt like a hundred feet just 

1632
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:47,950
straight down the wall.
Didn't touch anything because I'll.

1633
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:49,960
Cap is like a very clean vertical sheet 
rock.

1634
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,880
How long does it take to fall?
One hundred feet.

1635
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,640
That's like several.
Yeah,

1636
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,190
several seconds.
No,

1637
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,541
no,
no,

1638
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,040
no,
like four or five or something.

1639
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,080
But you accelerated very quickly to 
three long enough to be like,

1640
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:03,070
oh my God,
I'm going to die.

1641
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:04,883
No,
no,

1642
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:06,311
no.
Long enough.

1643
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:07,144
So the reason he fell so far is because 
we were doing this sort of complicated 

1644
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:10,870
maneuvers.
Uh,

1645
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,180
normally I would have a blade advice on.
I basically,

1646
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,640
it would be attached to the rope earlier
to like catch him,

1647
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,520
but I'd taken my blade of ice off and I 
was just tied into the end.

1648
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,353
So basically he fell on all the slack,
whipped through until it hit me at the 

1649
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:24,010
end of the rope.
But so when he yelled,

1650
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,320
I basically had time to be like,
oh my God,

1651
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:28,120
he's falling,
like brace for impact.

1652
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:28,954
Like knowing that in a second the rope 
is going to come tight against the end 

1653
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:31,834
that I'm tied into basically jerk me.
But then thankfully there's enough drag 

1654
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:37,004
and the system that it didn't jerk me 
off the stance that I was on or else I 

1655
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:39,664
would have gotten pulled like 15 feet 
across the wall and it was all messed 

1656
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:43,650
up.
So when he's falling and you're,

1657
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:44,484
you're realizing that you're going to 
get yanked by his fault or you like 

1658
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,970
digging into the,
you know,

1659
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,560
basically I was like,
oh my God,

1660
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:52,150
you know,
it was like brace yourself.

1661
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,223
Like I was in this position.
I was actually facing out away from the 

1662
01:06:55,301 --> 01:06:56,134
wall,
like facing out towards the meadow 

1663
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:01,090
because I was in an open corner.

1664
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,710
Like if you look at the corner of the 
room,

1665
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,510
imagine one leg on each side facing 
outward,

1666
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,353
like pushed into this position because 
it's like I was about to have to untie 

1667
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:10,354
my knot and retire and do some things.
And so I was basically like already to 

1668
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:15,640
do some things and all of a sudden I 
hear that he's falling and I was like,

1669
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,533
oh my God.
And then like I was able to just sorta 

1670
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,153
like stick in there Jesus.
But my point is just that taking big 

1671
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:22,534
fall.
I mean if you trust your equipment and 

1672
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:23,854
everything,
it can be okay to take big falls like 

1673
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:26,674
that.
You obviously try to avoid them because 

1674
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,830
you know,
had he hit a ledge or something,

1675
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:32,370
then potentially he could have died,
but because it was,

1676
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,700
it was clean there it was.
Okay.

1677
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:38,620
So if he was in a situation where there 
was a slight angle and he fell that far,

1678
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,510
that's where it's really dangerous.

1679
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:41,853
I mean worst case scenario would be if 
he fell 100 feet and 75 feet down there 

1680
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:46,024
was alleged sticking out how half the 
width of this table because then you 

1681
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:49,900
would just clip it,
you'd break both your legs,

1682
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:50,734
everything would explode and then you'd 
still know what do you do if you fall 

1683
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:58,000
and you break something and you're 
halfway up.

1684
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,110
We'll do so.
Okay.

1685
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:00,820
Same route.
The nose of El Cap,

1686
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:01,654
which we were trying to do the speed 
record on this friend of mine who I 

1687
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,390
actually previously held the speed 
record with this older guy,

1688
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,780
Hans flooring,
um,

1689
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,120
who actually wrote the book how to speed
climb that.

1690
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:12,310
I learned how to speed come from many 
years ago.

1691
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,910
So he freaking exactly what I'm 
describing.

1692
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,210
Sort of worst case scenario.
He took this 20,

1693
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:20,960
probably a 22 foot fall,
but he was unlucky enough,

1694
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:21,920
which is totally fine.

1695
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,940
He had a rope.
You had gear.

1696
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:24,550
Everything worked exactly the way it's 
supposed to.

1697
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:25,800
He just fell always,
which,

1698
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:26,743
which is normal,
but the bummer was that there was a 

1699
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:29,504
little ledge,
probably twice the size of that box 

1700
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:32,810
right there,
like that little wooden box,

1701
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:33,644
just kind of this little thing sticking 
out from the wall about this far that 

1702
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:36,554
basically he fell 20 feet hit that,
broke both of his ankles and then and 

1703
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:43,190
then went off in another two feet and so
the rope caught him and you know,

1704
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:45,560
the fall was exactly as expected.
All his gear held.

1705
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:46,394
Everything's totally normal except that 
he happened to hit that thing right at 

1706
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:52,130
the apex of the full force of his fall.
You know,

1707
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:54,560
I hid that legend two feet below.
It wouldn't matter at all.

1708
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:56,810
He would just hidden,
jumped off into space,

1709
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,640
but because you'd already fallen 20 
feet,

1710
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,390
broke both his ankles and then he was 
kind of horrible.

1711
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,860
I was actually up higher on the wall 
that day.

1712
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:04,694
I'd come in from above to repel in and 
work on something and I heard him 

1713
01:09:07,371 --> 01:09:08,204
yelling,
but I thought he was just hooting and 

1714
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:10,021
hollering like,
hey,

1715
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,180
you know,
how's it going type deal.

1716
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,253
And then I like it climbed out to the 
summit and then when I'd hiked halfway 

1717
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:17,300
back down I got a voicemail from him 
saying that,

1718
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:17,780
um,
you know,

1719
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:18,321
being like,
oh,

1720
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:18,941
hey,
it's Honda.

1721
01:09:18,941 --> 01:09:20,780
I think I've just broken my,
my tip fib.

1722
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,130
Um,
you know,

1723
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:23,961
basically like,
oh,

1724
01:09:23,961 --> 01:09:25,040
can you,
can you help her with her?

1725
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,040
He'd already called search and rescue 
and so rescue is already mobilized,

1726
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:32,000
but search and rescue in Yosemite,
it's really lead.

1727
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,100
They're really fast but it's still sort 
of by the books,

1728
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:35,540
you know,
it still takes kind of a lot of time.

1729
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,490
And so I was like,
Oh man,

1730
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:38,324
like maybe I should run back up and 
repel down and like help my buddy repel 

1731
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:42,610
down the wall again or something.

1732
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,453
Try to like get them out of here faster 
just because when search and rescue 

1733
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,060
mobilize,
it's like a long time.

1734
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:48,400
And I was like,
if he's in a lot of pain that,

1735
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,333
that sucks,
you know,

1736
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,140
um,
there as it,

1737
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,140
I really hesitated.
I wound up calling search and rescue and

1738
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:56,210
talking to through them to see if there 
was anything I could do to help.

1739
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:57,044
But ultimately I want them just going 
down because there wasn't really 

1740
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,673
anything for me to do.
So he's essentially just suspending for 

1741
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:04,070
awhile waiting for them to get them.
Yeah.

1742
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:07,370
So he basically just sat on the ledge 
with two broken legs for,

1743
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,800
you know,
six hours or 12 hours or something.

1744
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:10,634
And then eventually they managed to haul
him up to the summit and then I think 

1745
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:13,694
they helicoptered him off the next 
morning because it was already dark by 

1746
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:17,490
then.
Yeah,

1747
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,620
I know it was kind of horrible.

1748
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,750
But he sort of recovered by now it's 
been,

1749
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,900
it's been five months or something.
So he's back at it,

1750
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,120
always climbing.
He's the manager of a climate.

1751
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,073
He's,
you know.

1752
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,341
Yeah.
Well,

1753
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:31,360
I mean it's two broken bones.
I mean worse,

1754
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,300
it seems like.
No,

1755
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,730
super grim.
It was like.

1756
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,980
But that's an example of sort of worst 
case,

1757
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:38,000
you know,
just bad luck.

1758
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,230
Well that's actually not worst case 
right now that.

1759
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:42,170
Yeah,
that's not worst case.

1760
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,100
That's just bad luck.
Yeah.

1761
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:44,803
That's like when you're sitting there,
if you're sitting there hanging off a 

1762
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:50,810
ledge like that with two broken ankles 
for six hours.

1763
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,673
I mean that must be grim,
but I don't get to you the super groom 

1764
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:55,423
swelling and yeah.
So I think he and his partner actually 

1765
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:57,794
repelled down 100 feet to a slightly 
bigger ledge so that he could lay on it 

1766
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:01,124
and elevate his legs.
And then I think there were some other 

1767
01:11:02,871 --> 01:11:04,400
climbers around that game,
a jacket,

1768
01:11:04,401 --> 01:11:05,234
you know,
so he gets sort of bundle up and like 

1769
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,390
lay there and sort of manage.
But yeah,

1770
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:12,020
I mean it seems extremely character 
building the life you choose.

1771
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

1772
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,720
No,
it's really,

1773
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,553
I'm that,
that actually kind of makes me feel 

1774
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:17,790
really bad.
You could just.

1775
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:18,624
Because the like that kind of thing is 
really close to home because he's a 

1776
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:23,780
friend and it's just so bad.
Yeah.

1777
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,840
Not can only imagine.
Yeah.

1778
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:27,943
When,
when you think about your life and you 

1779
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:32,800
think about this stuff that you do,
do you do,

1780
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:37,930
is there a point where you feel like you
won't do it anymore or a point where you

1781
01:11:38,241 --> 01:11:39,074
feel like you want free solo anymore?
Or do you look at like your friend who 

1782
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:43,094
you were talking about who's older,
who's still free soloing and doing 

1783
01:11:45,741 --> 01:11:46,574
difficult paths?
Do you think this is just your life 

1784
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:48,704
forever?

1785
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,640
Um,
no.

1786
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,410
I don't know.
I honestly,

1787
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,363
I'm not sure.
I don't think it's my path forever 

1788
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:55,914
necessarily just because there just 
aren't always bigger and harder things 

1789
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:01,260
to do.
You know what I mean?

1790
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,920
El Cap represented sort of the end of 
this very long road for me.

1791
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:05,910
I mean I,
I sold many,

1792
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:06,744
many things that we're all sort of 
leading towards El Cap and then I 

1793
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:09,474
finally did that and that.
And at least right now I can't really 

1794
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:15,860
imagine anything more inspiring to me.
Uh,

1795
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,850
in terms of reselling,
I mean there are plenty of other climate

1796
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:19,500
challenges that I'm interested in.
Like I was just saying,

1797
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,080
doing the speed record is something that
I did this summer,

1798
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,110
but

1799
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,810
is this like winning a big hand in Vegas
where you're just like,

1800
01:12:25,811 --> 01:12:27,130
okay,
we got all the money

1801
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,220
the fuck out of here?
No,

1802
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,440
because that's that.
That is too much luck.

1803
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:32,280
You know what I mean?
It's like,

1804
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,130
it's more like realizing a life dream 
and you're sort of like,

1805
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:35,920
okay,
yeah,

1806
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,800
boundary I've seen.
But I mean,

1807
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:38,520
you know,
it's,

1808
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,080
it's a similar idea where you're like,
okay,

1809
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:40,920
I will.
No,

1810
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:41,890
it's not even.
I mean it's.

1811
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:43,110
Yeah.
Yeah,

1812
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:46,170
it's a bad analogy just in terms of 
like,

1813
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,480
no,
no more big crazy risks.

1814
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,943
Yeah.
But that's the thing is that it's not 

1815
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,500
even,
I was never seen as a big crazy risk,

1816
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:53,334
you know,
I wasn't what was or wasn't rolling the 

1817
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:55,164
dice.
I was sort of training for this thing 

1818
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,293
and then I did it and I'm just not sure 
if there's a bigger thing that's worth 

1819
01:12:59,611 --> 01:13:01,160
more effort,
you know?

1820
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:02,423
So I don't know.
I mean,

1821
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:02,910
uh,
you know,

1822
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:05,190
as you've seen the film,
like our relationship with my girlfriend

1823
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:06,024
and she's great and we have this nice 
life together and there's so much else 

1824
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:10,440
in climbing and um,
you know,

1825
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:11,274
I mean maybe I'll never,
never seek out big free soloing 

1826
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:15,270
challenges again.
I mean,

1827
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,133
we'll see

1828
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,220
now you're still relatively young in 
terms of life itself.

1829
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,083
Do you,
do you think maybe there could be 

1830
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:25,320
something that you would enjoy as much 
as you enjoy climbing?

1831
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:27,251
Well,
I mean,

1832
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:28,870
so no matter what I'll climb my whole 
life.

1833
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:29,704
I mean,
I forgetting,

1834
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,280
I love climbing.
I mean even on the phone here,

1835
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,133
I'm climbing in the gym everyday and 
just for the movement of it just to 

1836
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:35,980
enjoy climbing.
But,

1837
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:37,030
um,
I don't know,

1838
01:13:37,031 --> 01:13:37,630
I'm,
I,

1839
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,463
I have a foundation that I've worked 
with for the last five or six years 

1840
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:42,790
supporting solar around the world.
And so,

1841
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,040
um,
I could see putting more and more effort

1842
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:45,670
into that.
I mean,

1843
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:46,503
that's something that satisfying in a 
way that climbing sort of isn't because 

1844
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:52,240
it actually has a real tangible impact 
on the world.

1845
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:53,603
You know,
mean climbing is really fulfilling 

1846
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:57,250
personally,
but when it's all said and done,

1847
01:13:57,251 --> 01:13:58,730
it's like it's just me going rock 
climbing,

1848
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,640
it doesn't really matter,
but um,

1849
01:14:00,641 --> 01:14:02,080
but at least working with the 
foundation,

1850
01:14:02,081 --> 01:14:03,550
it's like actually doing something real.

1851
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:06,160
What is your foundation?
Just the foundation,

1852
01:14:06,161 --> 01:14:08,870
but it's a,
we've been supporting solar all this.

1853
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:12,380
I mean if you want the version is 
basically uh,

1854
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:13,573
you know,
I was looking for some way to do 

1855
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:15,424
something positive in the world.
So I was looking to support 

1856
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:18,340
environmental projects and then I was 
like,

1857
01:14:18,341 --> 01:14:19,174
there's no real point in supporting 
environmental projects that don't also 

1858
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:24,430
support in like increased standard of 
living that like help people in need.

1859
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,930
And that sort of led me to solar 
projects basically solar energy access.

1860
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:31,410
And so that's what we in sport in the 
last five,

1861
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,253
six years.
And so what do you do with this project 

1862
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:36,700
was so domestically it was,
it mostly,

1863
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:41,350
it's just been my way of donating my 
money to two other projects that support

1864
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,410
solar.
So I'm domestically in the US,

1865
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,120
I've been supporting this group,
grid alternatives for example,

1866
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,070
I'm in.

1867
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:48,971
So,
I mean,

1868
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:50,940
I've done a few ins,
installations with them in,

1869
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:54,190
in Sacramento,
in my hometown were basically low income

1870
01:14:54,191 --> 01:14:55,024
family,
just gets a free home solar system on 

1871
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:58,960
their house and so it saves them the 
energy bills,

1872
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:02,440
but then also in terms of carbon 
emissions is just,

1873
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:04,320
it's good for the planet,
you know,

1874
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,550
slowly greening the grid.
But um,

1875
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,893
and then the bigger potentially the 
bigger impacts have been projects we've 

1876
01:15:12,731 --> 01:15:16,010
been supporting in Africa,
I'm just give access to solar lantern,

1877
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:16,844
solar lights,
being able to charge cell phones 

1878
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,900
basically like small scale systems that 
was just a panel,

1879
01:15:19,901 --> 01:15:22,570
a battery and a few led lights and an 
iphone charger.

1880
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,913
But um,
but those kinds of things can 

1881
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:26,290
fundamentally change somebody's life 
because,

1882
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,183
you know,
east Africa people can spend up to a 

1883
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,270
quarter of their income on kerosene 
light just to light their home,

1884
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,710
which is totally outrageous.

1885
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:33,543
I mean imagine spending that percentage 
of your income just to have light after 

1886
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:36,870
dark,
you know,

1887
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,500
and like an equatorial regions of the 
earth.

1888
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,270
It's dark for 12 hours a day.
I mean,

1889
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:43,510
imagine if when the sun goes down,
your productive hours are done,

1890
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,490
you're just like,
I'm just going to sit in the dark for 12

1891
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:46,690
hours.
It's crazy,

1892
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:47,610
you know?
Yeah.

1893
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,513
I mean there,
there are a billion people on earth 

1894
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:53,620
living without access to power and I 
mean it's hard not for.

1895
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,560
I mean I kind of see that as a waste of 
human potential to some extent.

1896
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,423
Like it's just an unfortunate thing to 
think there are so many people living 

1897
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:01,900
without access to power.
I mean,

1898
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:03,730
it's crazy.
It is crazy.

1899
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:06,820
It's really crazy in California that 
there's not more solar.

1900
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:08,650
When you think about how often it's 
sunny here,

1901
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:09,743
he.
Yeah,

1902
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,833
no,
I mean it's,

1903
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,240
it's totally that.

1904
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,083
I mean at least it's,
it's growing very quickly in California 

1905
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:15,874
at least.
But I mean really solar should be 

1906
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:20,890
powering the whole or I mean enough 
sunlight hits the earth every.

1907
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,233
I don't know the terms.
It's every like 10 or 15 minutes 

1908
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,230
basically to power the earth for like 
the year.

1909
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,970
If you're able to harness all that 
energy,

1910
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,240
just kind of like.
It's just such a cleaner,

1911
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,430
simpler way of of powering the earth,
you know?

1912
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,020
Yeah.
It really is.

1913
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:38,740
And I mean one can only hope that that's
going to.

1914
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:40,993
It's going to keep continue.
It's gonna continue to evolve and the 

1915
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:44,794
thing,
the thing that drives me absolutely 

1916
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:46,834
crazy is that it.
It's totally obvious that in 100 years 

1917
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:53,770
the earth will be run through solar and 
things like that because there's just so

1918
01:16:53,771 --> 01:16:55,930
much energy spilling onto the earth and 
it's free.

1919
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,060
And so the technology is only improving.

1920
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:00,040
Everybody's adopting it like in 100 
years,

1921
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:02,080
no question.
Everything will be run from the sun.

1922
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:03,723
The thing that drives me insane is that 
there's so much resistance to it from 

1923
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:06,910
utilities,
from,

1924
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:09,110
from consumer ignorance,
from whatever else,

1925
01:17:09,111 --> 01:17:11,780
but people just don't totally get it and
sort of opposed to it.

1926
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,180
And so,
you know,

1927
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:17,120
half the world will be dragged kicking 
and screaming into the future and you're

1928
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:17,954
sort of like,
if you just embrace it and get there in 

1929
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:21,020
15 years instead of 100 years,
all,

1930
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,870
all the arguments about climate change,
all the arguments about,

1931
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,160
you know,
environmental degradation,

1932
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,430
all those kinds of things will be 
mitigated to a large extent.

1933
01:17:27,431 --> 01:17:29,720
And you sort of like,
is there a downside to that?

1934
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:30,554
You know,
like even if you don't believe in 

1935
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:32,850
climate change,
even if you know,

1936
01:17:32,851 --> 01:17:35,180
you denial the science behind it,
you think it's all bs.

1937
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:36,343
It's like,
is there really a downside to just 

1938
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:41,560
adopting the future sooner?
For me it's like,

1939
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,613
yeah,
it's like one of those things where 

1940
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:44,990
you're sort of like,
if it's going to happen eventually,

1941
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:47,480
let's just do it now and save all the 
fricken hassle again.

1942
01:17:47,481 --> 01:17:47,820
There.

1943
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,680
I think it's the momentum of the current
system.

1944
01:17:49,681 --> 01:17:50,514
It's very difficult for people to just 
abandoned established ways of doing 

1945
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:55,460
things,
especially down.

1946
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:57,180
We're so hooked on fossil fuels.

1947
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,083
I know,
but like it's just such a bummer that 

1948
01:17:58,901 --> 01:18:00,460
the status quo is such a thing.
You know,

1949
01:18:00,461 --> 01:18:01,100
people are like,
oh,

1950
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,860
that's the way we do it.
Let's just keep doing that.

1951
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:05,350
And it's just weird because there's so 
many things in life,

1952
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,890
the change so frequently,
you know,

1953
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,880
like I mean the world is constantly 
changing and you're like,

1954
01:18:09,881 --> 01:18:12,880
let's just embrace the changes that 
matter the most and just do them faster.

1955
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:14,200
Well,
you're talking about was a guy who

1956
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,043
he lives in a van and climbs rocks 
business people that have thousands and 

1957
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:20,893
thousands of employees and millions if 
not billions of money of dollars 

1958
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:25,250
invested in these things.
Yeah.

1959
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:26,084
Well,
yeah,

1960
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,110
that's the problem with parents system.
I know it's just too bad.

1961
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,080
Yeah,
but it's.

1962
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,750
It is,
but it's inevitable.

1963
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:33,584
I agree with you.
It's inevitable that we will embrace it 

1964
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:36,704
and change.
I think

1965
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:37,863
that's almost more frustrating though,
is because it's inevitable and yet it's 

1966
01:18:40,151 --> 01:18:42,310
going to be dragged out so long.
You're sort of like,

1967
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,650
why can't people just embrace the 
inevitability of it and just

1968
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,350
move forward?
Well,

1969
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,910
I think they slowly are,
but things like that take time.

1970
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,370
I think one,
one big thing is going to be if they can

1971
01:18:51,371 --> 01:18:55,630
ever figure out a way to solar power 
cars as you're driving them,

1972
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,760
so you never really have to concern 
yourself.

1973
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,810
I'll ever be a thing.
Well,

1974
01:18:58,811 --> 01:19:01,480
fisker figured out how to do it with 
your stereo.

1975
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:06,750
They figured out how to do it with your 
radio system and different kind of car.

1976
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,740
It is,
it's like a lot less energy,

1977
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,870
but it's just the roof panel.
The roof panel,

1978
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:11,963
isn't that,
didn't we?

1979
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,700
Um,
they,

1980
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,630
they are a weird company though.
That's the company that,

1981
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:17,493
um,
many years ago there was a big storm 

1982
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:20,584
that hit the east coast and they had a 
bunch of cars parked at a dock and they 

1983
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,340
all exploded when the water hit them and
they realize,

1984
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:25,721
wait,
wait,

1985
01:19:25,721 --> 01:19:26,111
wait,
wait.

1986
01:19:26,111 --> 01:19:28,960
You can't get your things drenched in 
water.

1987
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:30,023
Like when the water hit a certain level,
like they had a severe flaw and so they 

1988
01:19:34,511 --> 01:19:35,344
burst into flames and exploded.
And there's this whole like doc filled 

1989
01:19:40,631 --> 01:19:44,320
with these fisker Karma Karmas that blew
up.

1990
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,600
And they called them Karmas,
which has even more hilarious.

1991
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:49,450
You watch it exploding.
That's pretty bad.

1992
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,390
That's all bad all the way around.
Yeah.

1993
01:19:52,391 --> 01:19:54,950
I think they've since fixed that,
but yeah,

1994
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:55,960
it was a big flaw.

1995
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,530
So that's.
I was just actually reading,

1996
01:19:57,531 --> 01:19:59,180
I was reading this business management 
book,

1997
01:19:59,181 --> 01:20:00,014
but um,
if you're talking about the Ford Pinto 

1998
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,143
with a freaking gas tanks too close to 
the back bumper is based in your gas 

1999
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:07,040
tank,
protected by nature

2000
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,250
and you know,
speaking of exploding cards,

2001
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:12,084
but that actually I think killed lots of
people because they were actually put 

2002
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:14,994
into production and then there are tons 
of accidents and the car's explode and 

2003
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:18,510
you're just like,
man,

2004
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,230
that's been a bad decisions that an auto
manufacturing.

2005
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:23,910
Yeah,
the Pinto was a disaster.

2006
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,940
It wasn't good.
But yeah,

2007
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,450
I think what the,
what they're capable of doing right now,

2008
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:31,284
I think you're right.
I don't think you can power a car with 

2009
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,210
solar panels completely.
I mean,

2010
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,044
you certainly can from your house.
That was their initial claim when they 

2011
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:40,164
announced it,
that it would power the whole car and 

2012
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:43,260
everyone was like,
that's bullshit.

2013
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,300
You know,
that's definitely a bullshit.

2014
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:44,880
I mean,
just.

2015
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2016
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:46,023
I have to go two years ago they said 
they could power the whole car with the 

2017
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:51,090
roof.
August of 2016.

2018
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:53,700
Huh?
I'm trying to find a updates,

2019
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:54,330
but that seems.

2020
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:56,340
That seems totally outrageous because 
also,

2021
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:59,160
I mean the future of cars is born like a
smaller car with no,

2022
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,023
like a glass roof,
like Tesla style where it's sort of a 

2023
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,843
initial ad right here.
So a roof create enough energy to power 

2024
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:07,164
the car.
No other vehicles sold in the US has 

2025
01:21:08,361 --> 01:21:10,060
ever offered this capability.
What I mean,

2026
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,003
so that might be true if it just sat 
parked in the sun for 12 hours and then 

2027
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:16,710
he drove home run.
I mean the driveway.

2028
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:22,110
You worked at night charges all day and 
you and your commutes really short.

2029
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:22,944
Yeah.
But the numbers don't really don't work 

2030
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,433
well.
You would know better than anybody if 

2031
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:28,440
you're involved in solar.
I don't know,

2032
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:30,750
but I mean there's solar panels of 
today.

2033
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:31,584
I mean,
I have a buddy of mine that does a lot 

2034
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:34,620
of backpacking and he carries around 
this,

2035
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:35,454
uh,
it's like a foldable solar charger for 

2036
01:21:37,261 --> 01:21:38,094
his phone and he folds it up and lays it
out and then puts a charger there and 

2037
01:21:45,121 --> 01:21:47,070
then he uses that charger to charge his 
phone,

2038
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:51,900
but he doesn't like he'll go 20 plus 
days with justice thing you want me to.

2039
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,270
So I mentioned our expedition to 
Antarctica last winter,

2040
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:59,220
so that's 24 hours of sunlight because 
you're in Antarctica and in their summer

2041
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:00,443
and our entire expedition was run from 
solar and so we'd actually taken a 

2042
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,400
generator and the other guys on the trip
for oil,

2043
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:08,340
for the generator basically.
And so it wasn't gonna work.

2044
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,481
And so we're like,
oh,

2045
01:22:09,481 --> 01:22:11,010
I guess we'll have to try to use the 
solar,

2046
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:12,780
which has sort of been our backup 
system.

2047
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,681
And uh,
it actually,

2048
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:16,230
we ran the whole trip on solar and 
everything worked in,

2049
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:18,070
so they were filming.
So there are a bunch of cameras,

2050
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:19,260
a bunch of batteries,
laptops,

2051
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:20,940
backing up drives.
And then,

2052
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:22,620
uh,
they were flying a drone quite a bit for

2053
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:24,030
aerial footage.
Is all kind of beautiful,

2054
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:26,460
so I mean they basically ran this whole 
operation off solar.

2055
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,590
One of the,
one of the camera guys has got Pablo,

2056
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:29,080
he's a good friend.

2057
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:29,913
Mine.
I'm basically just had to wake up every 

2058
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:34,650
two hours to move the panels around the 
tent as the sun tracks around this guy,

2059
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,660
you know,
so that it's always in full sun.

2060
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:37,883
But um,
and he had to sleep with the batteries 

2061
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:40,230
and things to make sure things stay warm
enough.

2062
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,130
But otherwise,
I mean,

2063
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,770
but that's,
I mean because it's really cold.

2064
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:44,663
Yeah.
It's funny because you put your laptops 

2065
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:46,194
and stuff into coolers,
like in the ice chest to keep them 

2066
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:48,624
insulated enough to stay warm as opposed
to cold water because the outside 

2067
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:54,800
temperature is so cold.
But it was cool though because you know,

2068
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,550
that way we didn't have to run this like
loud,

2069
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:59,700
stinky,
annoying generator in like you just have

2070
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:01,710
your panels working fulltime.
Yeah.

2071
01:23:01,711 --> 01:23:02,544
That's one of the weird things about 
like Tesla's when you drive it in and 

2072
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,650
they're like,
yeah,

2073
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:06,730
no,
it's awesome.

2074
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,160
Yeah.
So much more peaceful.

2075
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:09,700
Yeah.
I mean,

2076
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,533
but that's the future.
It's like if you imagine a city that's 

2077
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:13,690
all silent electric cars,
no emissions.

2078
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:16,330
I mean imagine how much more pleasant 
the pedestrian experiences when they,

2079
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:19,540
when it's not like diesel exhaust right 
next to you on the city streets.

2080
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:20,403
Yeah.
You don't hear the car that runs you 

2081
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:24,060
over or you know,
but you still do though because uh,

2082
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,110
something like 30 percent of the noises,
the tires.

2083
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,960
It's like you still hear cars.
Yeah.

2084
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,890
But,
but it's just so much more mellow.

2085
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:32,050
You don't hear like an engine like 
ripping right by you.

2086
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,363
Yeah.
I think it's inevitable that we figured 

2087
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:39,271
out a way that you can just power 
everything from solar and including cars

2088
01:23:39,821 --> 01:23:41,100
as you're driving them.
I mean,

2089
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:44,430
don't make sense as the technology 
improves mean.

2090
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:45,310
Yeah,
we'll see.

2091
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,143
We'll see.
I mean there's development in a solar 

2092
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:52,810
film sort of in windows like so imagine 
an office building where the windows are

2093
01:23:52,811 --> 01:23:53,860
all producing power.

2094
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,470
So I mean if you think about that with a
car,

2095
01:23:55,471 --> 01:23:58,060
if it's just like a glass dome over you,
but it's all sort of producing power.

2096
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,841
No,
that'd be.

2097
01:23:58,841 --> 01:24:01,840
I mean it's pretty amazing.
I have a watch that was on solar power.

2098
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,660
That's not a lot of power,
but still,

2099
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:05,494
I mean,
you don't really need any batteries for 

2100
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,030
Casio.
Yeah,

2101
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,153
I do.
When I was a kid,

2102
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,300
I'd want to.
Yeah,

2103
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,000
that's pretty.
That's pretty straightforward though.

2104
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:15,190
It's a small amount of power that it's 
drawing.

2105
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,980
When you got involved in this,
um,

2106
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,680
how much preparation did you do?
I mean,

2107
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:21,514
what,
what was,

2108
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,730
what was the motivation for the 
foundation?

2109
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:26,240
Yeah.
Um,

2110
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,460
I mean honestly,
like I said,

2111
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:28,294
I was just looking to do something 
positive for the world and so exploring 

2112
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:34,240
options you will and so I was going to 
start donating significant percentage of

2113
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,074
my income to,
to environmental nonprofits and then I 

2114
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:40,440
decided that I should do it in sort of a
public facing way in,

2115
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,533
in the form of the foundation just 
because I felt like I'm never going to 

2116
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:47,560
have nearly as much money as,
as real philanthropic organization,

2117
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:48,394
you know,
like the bill and Melinda Gates 

2118
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,660
Foundation.

2119
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:52,780
Like I'll never have it.
I'll never have real dollars like that,

2120
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:56,830
but I do sort of have this platform like
some sort of public persona,

2121
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:58,000
whatever.
And so I was like,

2122
01:24:58,001 --> 01:24:58,834
well,
at least if I donate things that I can 

2123
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:01,930
sort of leverage that in the right way 
to contribute,

2124
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,900
I don't know,
basically try and maximize the good that

2125
01:25:04,901 --> 01:25:06,130
I'm doing.
And so,

2126
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:06,701
um,
yeah,

2127
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:07,534
so then I just started researching 
organizations that I felt like we're 

2128
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:13,030
doing great work and that led me to 
solar basically does most of your income

2129
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:16,210
come from sponsors and from public 
appearances,

2130
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:20,650
like how it was mostly sponsors and then
it sort of has shifted into sponsors and

2131
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:22,300
sort of one off things.
So like,

2132
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:23,134
um,
I published a book a few years ago and 

2133
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:28,540
so there's an advanced from that and 
like the film has made a little money,

2134
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,600
um,
the random little things in the now it's

2135
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:32,434
also sort of split with corporate 
speaking type commercial opportunities 

2136
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:36,424
as well.

2137
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:38,710
So sponsorship is still probably the 
biggest thing for me.

2138
01:25:38,711 --> 01:25:40,420
So like the northface been my biggest 
sponsor,

2139
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,850
um,
and most important sponsor for me.

2140
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:45,430
But then now it's sort of split between 
a bunch of different sources,

2141
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:49,840
just sort of public speaking things have
these corporate appearances.

2142
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:50,674
You just go and get,
just talk to them about free solo 

2143
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:55,420
climbing and yeah,
talk to them about climate.

2144
01:25:55,421 --> 01:25:58,420
Talking about preparation or I mean 
depends on what somebody needs.

2145
01:25:58,421 --> 01:25:59,254
Really.
It depends what the organizations I've 

2146
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:01,143
spoken to a bunch of a venture capital 
firms about risk taking and risk 

2147
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:06,740
management or how that's interesting,
you know,

2148
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,293
so they just look at you as like sort of
an inspiration to mix things up for the 

2149
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:12,470
company.
Yeah,

2150
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:16,070
I mean I'd like to think that it's a 
slightly more interesting topic than the

2151
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:17,280
average business speaker,
you know,

2152
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,850
I mean it's certainly more beautiful 
images,

2153
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:19,641
you know,
like if I,

2154
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:21,290
if I give a nice slideshow and chat for 
a bit,

2155
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:22,550
it's um,
you know,

2156
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:25,040
I mean it's beautiful,
it's different and um,

2157
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:27,830
but I think that it still gets back to 
some of the same elemental issues,

2158
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:28,760
you know,
talking about the.

2159
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,283
Yeah,
I mean how do you manage risk in your 

2160
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:33,860
life and what's worth it and how do you 
choose it's,

2161
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,023
it's a smart move to for company to just
kinda like very the kind of input that 

2162
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:39,820
gets to the,
the,

2163
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:40,653
the employees like give them something 
that's kind of spectacular and 

2164
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:48,521
interesting and you know really well now
when you look at the future,

2165
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,480
do you,
do you have a map of what you would like

2166
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:54,490
to be doing?
Do you,

2167
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:57,570
are you just sort of enjoying your 
experience here or do,

2168
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:02,480
do you have grand plans?
I don't really have grand plans.

2169
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:04,250
I mean I've never really had a grand 
plan.

2170
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:07,070
It's always been that I love climbing.
I want to do it well.

2171
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:10,580
I want to push myself and I think that's
kind of my grand plan.

2172
01:27:10,581 --> 01:27:13,460
I mean I'm a,
I'm still trying to be a better climber.

2173
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:14,303
I'm still trying to grow the foundation,
do something more significant through 

2174
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:19,460
it.
I'm actually hired a full time executive

2175
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:21,320
director this year,
this woman who's running a me,

2176
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:23,760
which is kind of awesome.
So we're actually sort of ramping it all

2177
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,613
up a little bit.
That was slightly in response to the 

2178
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:27,800
film because I sort of figured that,
you know,

2179
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:28,634
this is like a moment that I should try 
to take advantage of and use it to do 

2180
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:31,574
something more positive and so,
so that's sort of exciting for me and 

2181
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:36,950
um,
it's definitely not a grand plan,

2182
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:37,691
but it's,
you know,

2183
01:27:37,691 --> 01:27:40,220
it's just sort of all incremental 
incremental progress.

2184
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:45,070
So when you're doing all these climbs,
you have a lot of time when you're,

2185
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:47,510
it takes time to do these things.
So was this,

2186
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:51,440
when you start thinking about these 
ideas about thinking about like how much

2187
01:27:51,441 --> 01:27:52,274
you enjoy being out here in nature and 
what I'm caring about the environment 

2188
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:56,990
for sure.

2189
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:57,823
Yeah,
for sure.

2190
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,800
I mean I spend most of my time in the 
most beautiful places on earth.

2191
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:01,634
I mean,
spending most of my time in national 

2192
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:06,830
parks and public lands in general.
And so I'm in all these beautiful places

2193
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:07,341
and it's like,
yeah,

2194
01:28:07,341 --> 01:28:08,780
I mean I care about them.
I went to,

2195
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,200
you know,
if I have a family someday,

2196
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:13,160
I want to be able to take my kids to the
same places and have them appreciate the

2197
01:28:13,161 --> 01:28:14,960
land in the same way.
I mean,

2198
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,423
yeah,
so like you send of the last five years 

2199
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:20,960
for can the entire forest is basically 
died from pine beetles,

2200
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:21,913
will all the pine trees have basically 
died because pine beetles and so like 

2201
01:28:24,261 --> 01:28:25,094
just in the last five years,
let's say the Yosemite Valley floor has 

2202
01:28:28,131 --> 01:28:28,964
sort of transformed from like a dense 
pine forest to sort of this open oak 

2203
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:32,444
forest.
It's like totally different character 

2204
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,633
because all the pine trees have died and
then they've been cutting them all down 

2205
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:36,980
to reduce fuel load.

2206
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,260
So they're basically logging trucks with
pine trees,

2207
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:42,110
leaving the park nonstop,
which you know,

2208
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:43,510
which I'm,
which I totally support.

2209
01:28:43,511 --> 01:28:46,940
I'm not like anti logging the dead trees
because like you may as well use them if

2210
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:47,774
they're already dead.
And I definitely don't want to see so 

2211
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:51,890
many value all burst into flames.
So it makes sense,

2212
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:52,820
but at the same time,
I mean,

2213
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,350
you know,
that's a real,

2214
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:55,663
that's a very direct result of climate.
Gender mean it's 10 years of drought in 

2215
01:28:57,531 --> 01:29:00,620
California combined with,
with shorter winters.

2216
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:04,770
It's like just have these beetles 
decimating the entire forest and I don't

2217
01:29:04,771 --> 01:29:05,330
know,
I mean that's,

2218
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,163
that sucks,
you know,

2219
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,430
like I don't,
I don't want to see the whole forest die

2220
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:13,431
and it's not an invasive beetle or is it
a beetle invasive invasive in that,

2221
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:14,923
uh,
I don't know specifically with you 

2222
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:17,010
seminar,
I could be wrong about this,

2223
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:18,680
but with a lot of the pine beetle 
problems in,

2224
01:29:18,681 --> 01:29:19,514
in Colorado,
it has more to do with shorter winter 

2225
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:26,391
and warmer temperatures because normally
the larva would die through the winter.

2226
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:28,370
They would freeze.
Um,

2227
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,690
but you know,
basically they're not freezing in to the

2228
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:31,524
same extent.
And so the population explodes and then 

2229
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:35,040
you wind up with all the trees dying 
while we were there.

2230
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:35,874
And we were in big bear a few years back
when they were having a real issue with 

2231
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:42,660
it and they were having real significant
fire scares young.

2232
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,730
It was,
it was nerve wracking.

2233
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:45,590
No,
I mean you,

2234
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,400
somebody who was like on fire for most 
of the summer.

2235
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:48,234
It was this crazy for the whole southern
part of the park was like burning for 

2236
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:52,470
months and that's,
you know,

2237
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:54,780
I mean fire is a natural part of the 
ecosystem and that,

2238
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:56,460
you know,
to some extent your life that's normal,

2239
01:29:56,461 --> 01:29:59,340
but it's like it's not normal right now 
because the fuel load is so high.

2240
01:29:59,341 --> 01:30:00,900
It's like so dry.
It's just,

2241
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:01,980
it's too much,
you know,

2242
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:03,203
and I just would love for my kids 
someday to be able to appreciate the 

2243
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:08,400
park the way I have for so long and I 
just don't want to see you don't burn.

2244
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,660
Yeah.
When I was,

2245
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:12,240
when we were in big bear,
that's my feeling.

2246
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:14,070
It was,
it was,

2247
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:17,760
it was sad that you're seeing something 
that was probably this rich green,

2248
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:21,710
lush forest that's now really weird gray
and drive.

2249
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,240
But it was also like you're around 
kindling,

2250
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,133
like you're basically in a big stack of 
dry wood before it gets lit on fire and 

2251
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:32,040
you're surrounded by it and there's 
enough.

2252
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,900
It hits up there.
It's,

2253
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:34,843
I mean I've,
we've been evacuated where I live 

2254
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,710
several times,
twice,

2255
01:30:37,711 --> 01:30:40,720
actually come close a couple of other 
times and it's,

2256
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,650
it's terrifying because southern 
California when it goes,

2257
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:46,900
it goes and there's just no stopping it.
No,

2258
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:47,760
I mean that's.
Yeah,

2259
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,330
no,
that's.

2260
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:50,520
I mean that's like,
yeah,

2261
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:51,354
this is why I'm like,
this is why we transitioned to solar 

2262
01:30:52,501 --> 01:30:53,130
sooner,
you know,

2263
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:56,070
because it's like if it helps at all 
with these kinds of issues,

2264
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:56,904
then it's like,
worth,

2265
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,230
worth the effort,
you know,

2266
01:30:58,970 --> 01:30:59,910
it's going to happen anyway.

2267
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:01,230
It's like you may as well just do it 
now,

2268
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,420
so I just think that you were doing an 
Antarctica,

2269
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:06,570
you're filming something there as well.
Do you do a lot of that now?

2270
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,660
I'm well for a trip like that for an 
expedition.

2271
01:31:09,661 --> 01:31:10,494
I mean that was the north face 
expedition and so that's where they get 

2272
01:31:11,851 --> 01:31:16,620
a lot of their brand content and so it 
makes sense to film a trip like that and

2273
01:31:16,621 --> 01:31:18,150
we were somewhere where the nobody ever 
goes.

2274
01:31:18,151 --> 01:31:18,984
We were doing first a sense of peaks,
ended up never been climbed so it kind 

2275
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:22,590
of makes sense to document that to some 
extent.

2276
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:28,580
But in general I think I try to balance 
my just pure climbing with filming.

2277
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:31,340
That's what I was going to ask you.
Like you don't want to get,

2278
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:32,203
you don't want to film all the timing,
everything that's on your head every 

2279
01:31:35,231 --> 01:31:35,730
week.

2280
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:37,890
Now that stuff drives me crazy.
I'm not into that.

2281
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:40,410
But when you're in the most beautiful 
place,

2282
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,470
sometimes it makes sense.
Well where's something,

2283
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,453
especially for someone like north face,
I mean their whole company is about 

2284
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,080
really exploration.
Yeah.

2285
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,580
Yeah.
When,

2286
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:55,660
when you are in that sort of situation 
where you're filming these things,

2287
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:59,980
like is it difficult to be,
to act normal,

2288
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,830
to be,
to,

2289
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:03,730
to be yourself?
We're not refuse if you saw free solar,

2290
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:04,564
you know,
that I only have one mode and that's 

2291
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:06,610
just,
that's just me.

2292
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:08,530
Um,
which I mean when,

2293
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:10,540
when I see the film,
a lot of them like,

2294
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,433
oh,
maybe I need to censor myself a little 

2295
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,413
more.
Like maybe think there should be a 

2296
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,810
little more thoughtful about what I say,
but,

2297
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:18,280
but um,
no,

2298
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:19,780
I mean I'm pretty much always,
I just,

2299
01:32:19,781 --> 01:32:21,760
I just do.
Me and the people are filming or not.

2300
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,200
They just get.
I mean,

2301
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:25,480
I'm more mindful of profanity and a few 
things like that.

2302
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:26,770
If I know that I'm being filmed right 
now,

2303
01:32:26,771 --> 01:32:27,604
I'm being watched.
Then I try to be slightly more 

2304
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:30,274
respectful,
especially if I see kids in an audience 

2305
01:32:31,481 --> 01:32:33,790
that definitely try not to curse.
But um,

2306
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:34,901
but overall I'm like,
no,

2307
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:36,610
I just,
I just always stay in my mind,

2308
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:37,351
you know.
Well,

2309
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:40,840
that's what I was talking about earlier 
when I was asking the difference between

2310
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:45,820
you when you're being your,
your love of this is your love of nature

2311
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:46,893
and of being in these beautiful national
forests and public lands and 

2312
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:50,764
experiencing these amazing environments.
But then sometimes that gets sort of 

2313
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:59,620
perverted when you filming everything 
and you've got people just.

2314
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:00,693
Everything becomes this sort of 
presentation and everything becomes 

2315
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:05,733
professional.
And I mean I think that's the risk with 

2316
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:08,680
filming.

2317
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,050
I think with Free Solo.
I think they did an amazing job of,

2318
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:15,030
of maintaining the character,
you know,

2319
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,320
the nuance.
Not perverting it in any way.

2320
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:18,251
No,
I think so too.

2321
01:33:18,251 --> 01:33:19,570
I think it was amazing.
Yeah.

2322
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:20,051
I mean,
I think,

2323
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:20,884
uh,
I think they did a really good job of 

2324
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:22,330
that,
like,

2325
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,160
and it's still,
it's still sort of understated,

2326
01:33:24,161 --> 01:33:24,994
you know,
even though it's like this spectacular 

2327
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:26,584
feat,
it's still sort of subdued and its own 

2328
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:28,264
way.
It's just sort of lays it out 

2329
01:33:28,991 --> 01:33:29,824
beautifully.
Let's you just sort of judge for 

2330
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:31,690
yourself and just,
well,

2331
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:32,583
you know,
it's impossible to be anything but 

2332
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,770
spectacular so you don't really have to 
dress it up.

2333
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:37,310
Yeah,
yeah,

2334
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,143
totally.
Well that's the beauty of filming 

2335
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:40,460
anything in Yosemite is that it's just,
I mean it's,

2336
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:41,383
it's honestly just one of the most 
beautiful places on earth would be like 

2337
01:33:42,911 --> 01:33:46,630
putting a pretty dress on a Ferrari or 
like leave it alone.

2338
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,630
It's done.
You've already got it.

2339
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,960
Have you ever thought about doing some 
like live journal from the field or some

2340
01:33:55,511 --> 01:33:58,090
sort of a podcast or something along 
those lines?

2341
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,360
Um,
no,

2342
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,700
I mean,
should I.

2343
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:02,980
yeah,
that sounds,

2344
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:06,250
that sounds like too much work.
A podcast would be easy.

2345
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,533
I don't know,
but you have to be able to interview 

2346
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:09,390
people proper way.
No,

2347
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:10,170
you don't.
No,

2348
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:11,003
you don't think.
My friend bill burr has a podcast where 

2349
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:16,700
he just talks.
He does a fucking great,

2350
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,540
but he's a comedian.
Oh yeah,

2351
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:18,900
yeah.
Okay.

2352
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:22,690
With Monday morning podcast,
but you just sitting down.

2353
01:34:22,691 --> 01:34:25,940
I mean you could go off notes,
you could go off of and just.

2354
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:29,620
I think people would love that if you 
just never thought about it.

2355
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:31,930
I mean in some ways I do have strong 
opinions about a lot of things,

2356
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:32,764
like if I just ranted about 
environmental issues and similar things 

2357
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:36,910
that I care about,
that actually would be kind of fun,

2358
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,073
but you'd have a significant impact to 
especially have such a large platform 

2359
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:42,510
now.
I Dunno,

2360
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,470
I dunno.
I'll consider it.

2361
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:45,850
That's the first time that anyone's ever
mentioned.

2362
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:47,590
I'm sort of like,
I could think about that.

2363
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,270
I'm notorious for trying to talk people 
into podcast,

2364
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:52,840
but I really think in your case you'd be
a great idea.

2365
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:54,310
I mean,
you really feel like.

2366
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:57,200
I tell everyone to do it,
but you should really do it well.

2367
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,040
People get mad

2368
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,420
at me.
You keep telling people to do it,

2369
01:34:59,421 --> 01:35:03,320
but I think you,
if you had a portable unit,

2370
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:07,370
like a fricking players,
something you can just record a phone.

2371
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:08,280
Really?
Oh yeah.

2372
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,100
A recording on your phone.
It's very easy.

2373
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:11,550
Um,
you could,

2374
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:15,980
I mean we've done a bunch of them were 
just the voice notes from the phone just

2375
01:35:15,981 --> 01:35:16,814
talking to the voice notes from the 
phone and you can make a podcast off 

2376
01:35:18,831 --> 01:35:21,660
that and it's really easy to upload.
But just saving.

2377
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:23,930
Maybe that's my future.
Sitting in your van,

2378
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:27,740
you know,
afterwards and just talking about things

2379
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:32,741
you're working on with your foundation,
talking about spectacular moments during

2380
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:36,190
climbs where you're,
you're seeing things and you know,

2381
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:40,130
talking about what it's been like doing 
this tour for free.

2382
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,553
Yeah.
No,

2383
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:42,430
I'm like,
I'll,

2384
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:43,640
I'll,
I'll think about it.

2385
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:46,300
I mean that's interesting.
I understand where to put it out there.

2386
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,890
I mean,
I think it's a great idea,

2387
01:35:47,891 --> 01:35:48,800
man.
Huh?

2388
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,053
Huh?
You consider to get it out or send me a 

2389
01:35:53,471 --> 01:35:54,430
little MP.
Three recorder.

2390
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:58,630
We can definitely do that,
but we could also help you like pro.

2391
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,940
I can promote it for you,
put it on twitter,

2392
01:36:00,941 --> 01:36:02,620
let people,
we'll see if uh,

2393
01:36:02,621 --> 01:36:04,000
if I ever actually do anything like 
that.

2394
01:36:04,570 --> 01:36:05,141
But um,
but no,

2395
01:36:05,141 --> 01:36:05,974
it's an interesting idea.
I mean it's an interesting way to like 

2396
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,620
share,
share ideas better.

2397
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:09,840
Well,

2398
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,130
well the reason why I'm saying this just
because you have this very specific,

2399
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:16,043
very unusual life and you also have all 
these ideas about the environment and 

2400
01:36:21,511 --> 01:36:26,511
have all these ideas about using it for 
positive reasons and altruistic,

2401
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:30,330
hoping to freaking make the world a 
better place and having,

2402
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:31,223
making an impact with your foundation.
I really think it could look the best 

2403
01:36:35,311 --> 01:36:37,850
thing with your foundation would be to 
make,

2404
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:41,700
make it expose to more people and it 
would most certainly do that.

2405
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,673
Yeah.
Yeah.

2406
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,530
I'll talk to my executive director about
that too.

2407
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:46,364
I mean that would be an interesting way 
to at least share the ideas that I care 

2408
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,360
about.
Yeah,

2409
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,400
exactly.
The idea of just sitting in a recording,

2410
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:53,234
I'm like,
oh yeah,

2411
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:54,940
Kinda cool.
You know,

2412
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:55,783
like,
like you at the base of a mountain just 

2413
01:36:57,771 --> 01:37:01,620
talking about this and climbing and your
personal thoughts in that

2414
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:05,290
could be Douchey,
but it'd have to be well done.

2415
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:07,150
You'd have to be a Douche bag for it to 
be douchey.

2416
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:09,640
Well that's the danger.
That's the danger.

2417
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,900
You just never.
I mean,

2418
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,700
nobody thinks that they're the Douche,
you know,

2419
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:16,000
you think you'd become a Douche or you 
just never know.

2420
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:16,834
You never know when you're like,
I'm just gonna record monologues of me 

2421
01:37:18,821 --> 01:37:19,654
rambling about ideas.
That's when you start to trend towards 

2422
01:37:22,301 --> 01:37:23,580
do sheena's perhaps.
Well,

2423
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:24,603
it's a slippery slope.
You could always review it or have your 

2424
01:37:26,681 --> 01:37:28,000
girlfriend review it.
Yeah,

2425
01:37:28,001 --> 01:37:28,650
that's.

2426
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,740
You don't have to do it live.
Just,

2427
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,800
you know.
And then she could say,

2428
01:37:31,801 --> 01:37:32,634
okay,
that part we use rant and rave about 

2429
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:35,220
diesel might want to.

2430
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:39,040
No,
I mean why or maybe not.

2431
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:39,490
Yeah.
No,

2432
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:41,830
I feel strongly about.
I'll rant and rave about diesel forever.

2433
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,520
That's just not bros.
Yeah man.

2434
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:46,150
Imagine when electric trucks,
You know,

2435
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:50,770
like long haul trucking or mike.
Oh well tesla's already on there.

2436
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:51,830
On the ball with that.
Yeah.

2437
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,673
We'll hopefully,
I kind of don't care who comes market 

2438
01:37:55,471 --> 01:37:56,160
first,
that stuff.

2439
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,320
I just want somebody to start selling a 
lot of them.

2440
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:59,154
She was lIke,
I just wanted the change to happen 

2441
01:37:59,971 --> 01:38:01,530
quickly.
It doesn't matter who does it or how.

2442
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:02,820
It's like,
it just needs to happen.

2443
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:05,310
You've got a very significant voice 
right now.

2444
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,640
I really think that you could make a big
impact with a lot of people.

2445
01:38:08,641 --> 01:38:11,640
And the thing about these impacts,
it's sorta like the butterfly effect,

2446
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:12,474
right?
It's like you never know what it 

2447
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:14,064
actually changes.
I agree with how many people are going 

2448
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:18,930
to hear you just from this podcast and 
the things you're saying about solar and

2449
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:21,300
about and people thinking about like,
yeah,

2450
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:24,000
maybe,
maybe I can do something and then boom,

2451
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:24,953
it just makes these little incremental 
steps and then they carry on momentum 

2452
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:32,910
and you never know.
Well that's the,

2453
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,890
that's the positive way of looking at 
it,

2454
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:39,891
you know,
cool to like notes from wherever you are

2455
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:40,800
just.

2456
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,240
I mean he doesn't,
you don't have to have.

2457
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,163
The beautiful thing is too,
it doesn't have to have any kind of 

2458
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:46,170
structure.
You don't have to have any time.

2459
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:49,410
You can do one for 15 minutes if you 
want and people will listen to it.

2460
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:50,483
You could do it for an hour,
know that that might be a little micro 

2461
01:38:52,561 --> 01:38:56,370
hits like little rambles for sure.
Do it as long as you want,

2462
01:38:56,371 --> 01:38:58,080
and it looked.
Like I said,

2463
01:38:58,081 --> 01:39:01,080
the beautiful thing about things like 
this is that there's no.

2464
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:05,760
There's no real structure to it where 
you have to do something totally.

2465
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:09,030
Totally.
You just decide in a lot of ways,

2466
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:11,960
that's the nature of climbing to where 
you never have to do anything.

2467
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:14,010
You just find what inspires you.
You work towards it,

2468
01:39:14,011 --> 01:39:14,844
you do it when you're excited about it.
I'm totally into that kind of thing 

2469
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:18,710
because it's actually,
that's.

2470
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,553
I've always cry,
contrast to cliMbing from other 

2471
01:39:20,851 --> 01:39:22,620
mainstream sports like that because with
climbing,

2472
01:39:22,621 --> 01:39:25,040
it's like the objective is always there.
YOu're always inspired by it.

2473
01:39:25,041 --> 01:39:25,874
You do it whenever you're ready as 
opposed to having to perform on the 

2474
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:29,890
right day at the right time.
You know,

2475
01:39:29,891 --> 01:39:31,470
it's like,
I love that lifesTyle where you're like,

2476
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:32,520
you know,
today is my day,

2477
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:33,354
or today's not my day,
just like maybe like leading up to you 

2478
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:38,394
free soloing el cap.
If there was sort of a documented audio 

2479
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:48,591
journal while I watch the film,
this is,

2480
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,270
you're just wetting their appetite.
I mean it's a beautiful film.

2481
01:39:51,271 --> 01:39:52,104
It's fantastic,
but there's people like to see more and 

2482
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,573
more stuff.
Interesting and it's entirely up to you 

2483
01:39:58,501 --> 01:40:00,140
what you want to share.
Don't want to share it.

2484
01:40:00,141 --> 01:40:03,660
Especially if yOu do it this way.
You don't have an executive producer,

2485
01:40:03,661 --> 01:40:04,660
you don't have directors,
you know,

2486
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,430
totally would.

2487
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:07,470
That.
I definitely couldn't handle too much.

2488
01:40:07,471 --> 01:40:08,304
Just you just,
you just talking about stuff and your 

2489
01:40:11,341 --> 01:40:14,310
specific vision of the things that you'd
like to talk about and your,

2490
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:17,820
your specific message because that's one
of the things that people really,

2491
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:22,320
really enjoy about something like a 
podcast is that they know there's no one

2492
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,930
telling you what to say or what to do 
that,

2493
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:26,220
you know,
following your heart,

2494
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:28,620
sitting in his van,
you know,

2495
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:32,310
drinking a cup of tea just with the 
iphone talking.

2496
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:35,160
It's hard to imagine people would find 
that.

2497
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:37,270
Understand what I'm telling You.
Oh,

2498
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,170
I'm really surprised.
I bet though.

2499
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:40,763
Tell him jamie people,
Would it be listening to it people to 

2500
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:44,850
you for sure.
Oh no.

2501
01:40:44,851 --> 01:40:45,684
I appreciate that,
but I'm slightly worried I'm going to 

2502
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:48,870
be.
I'm going to miss my plane.

2503
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,441
Okay.
Yeah,

2504
01:40:49,441 --> 01:40:52,050
we gotta get you outta here.
Thank you very much.

2505
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:54,400
Thanks for being here.
I really appreciate

2506
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,840
it.
Excellent.

2507
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:56,581
Yeah,
it's fun.

2508
01:40:56,581 --> 01:40:57,414
It's fun to chat again because I 
remember last time I was on the show 

2509
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,310
with,
it was a full experience for him.

2510
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,400
It's one of the first time that I'd done
anything like that and it was like,

2511
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,790
It was pretty mega.
I was like,

2512
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:05,380
whoa,
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2513
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:06,214
This is so much.
And like now I feel so much more 

2514
01:41:07,211 --> 01:41:09,790
comfortable and fun to chat.
It was awesome.

2515
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:10,624
It was great.
It was really great to see what I'm 

2516
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:12,820
saying.
It feels like coming of age to come back

2517
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:13,950
and shouted.
Yeah,

2518
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,190
it's really nice.
Beautiful.

2519
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:15,941
Alright,
cool.

2520
01:41:15,941 --> 01:41:16,930
I appreciate it.
Thanks alex.

2521
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:19,820
Appreciate it.
Yeah,

2522
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,000
that's what I remember last time.
