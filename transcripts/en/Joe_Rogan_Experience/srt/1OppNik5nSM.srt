1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,570
Um,
uh,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,533
Christine,
we're live.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,770
Hey,
how you doing?

4
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:10,070
We talked a lot before this podcast.
We even said we weren't going to talk.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,050
We're like glitch.
I don't want to talk to you too much.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,000
A lot of stuff's talk about,
but Dan,

7
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,160
we got into everything.
Christie Brinkley,

8
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,400
fibonacci sequence,
any robbins.

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,370
Tony Robbins.
We covered a lot of ground crime.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,410
Um,
boyfriend's as dogs,

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,210
as protective dogs.
Yes.

12
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:27,900
Protective.
Um,

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,970
how did you get to become a life coach?

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,510
Oh Gosh.
It wasn't the worst.

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:34,871
No,
no,

16
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:35,311
no,
no.

17
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:36,390
It's just a long,
it's not,

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,940
I never planned on it and I don't really
even like that

19
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,930
got cooked at home.
What's a good name?

20
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,420
I haven't come up with a better name for
it and let's come up with right.

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,560
Maybe by the end of the show we'll come
up with something better so that,

22
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:47,700
that's,
that's your job,

23
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,680
Joe.
I've got my new title by the end of the

24
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,360
show.
So I started out in Hollywood actually.

25
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,810
I moved out after college to La because
mainly because growing up I was teased a

26
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,590
lot.
I was massively insecure.

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,440
And if you've got something to prove,
Hollywood's a great place to come to

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,690
came out here to like,
oh,

29
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,460
fucking show you.
I'll show you.

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:08,851
Yeah.
I,

31
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,580
since I didn't fit in,
I didn't have a lot of friends and boys

32
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,130
didn't really ever like me unless they
wanted to cheat off my paper.

33
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,280
I became addicted to achieving and
that's like,

34
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,990
what can I be?
I want to be somebody.

35
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,860
Like if only I was somebody.
Oh yeah.

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,350
How old was I?
Yeah.

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,060
Oh Gosh.
When it started,

38
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,860
ten eight something like that.

39
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,140
That's when you started like wanting to
prove yourself.

40
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:29,741
Well,
that's one,

41
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:29,940
not

42
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,830
teasing started happening and that's
when I started to feel like I didn't

43
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:38,490
really fit in and I needed to find a way
to feel worth something.

44
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,130
So overachieving kind of became my way
to do that.

45
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,460
And then at 10 I was diagnosed with
depression and put on Prozac at 10 I

46
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,800
know that's what we'll bookmark that
combined.

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,600
And so from a very early age,
I really thought something was wrong

48
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:55,860
with me.
I didn't fit in.

49
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,010
And so I had to come up with these
compensatory strategies to feel worthy,

50
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,940
to feel validated,
to feel like I mattered.

51
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,570
And so I just became like straight a
student addicted to achieving,

52
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,930
went out to college route,
grew up in Texas,

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,050
went to northwestern,
graduated early and was just committed

54
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,690
to moving to Hollywood and working my
way up as an actor.

55
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:16,830
I mean,
as a kid I was an actor.

56
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,240
I tried that for a little bit and then I
was like,

57
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,920
Whoa,
this is way too much rejection.

58
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,140
I can't deal with this.
I want to go on the other side of the

59
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,720
camera and pursue this career in
Hollywood.

60
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,940
And I didn't know what exactly I was
gonna do.

61
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,100
I thought I was going to be a producer
or something like that.

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,330
But I came out,
I was 20 years old and I applied to the

63
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,290
William Morris Agency to,
you know,

64
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,420
being assistant.
They're like,

65
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,740
you have to go through the training
program,

66
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,440
which is like pushing mail carts around.
And I did not want to do that.

67
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,441
So somehow I got a desk like really
early and started working for the head

68
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,050
of TV packaging and quickly learned I
did not want to be an agent.

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,780
Like it just didn't like it.
It was crazy long hours.

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,980
I was treated poorly.

71
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,560
It was just a hellish job and it was a
lot of selling.

72
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,970
I didn't really,
I don't like that either.

73
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,690
So I left and actually went and worked
on the man show I did.

74
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,440
I was thought maybe I'll like
production.

75
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,590
So first season as demand show I was
there,

76
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,190
which was kind of a blast.
And also just crazy.

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,700
It's a crazy show to work on.
I mean Jimmy and Adam were always like

78
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,710
super awesome to me,
but I was,

79
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,000
you know,
a young girl,

80
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,570
pa running around there,
the dancers were everywhere.

81
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,500
Like I just,
I was like,

82
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,890
what am I doing here?
So I quickly got out of production and

83
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,790
then started in comedy development at
paramount and started scouting comedians

84
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,810
and going to comedy clubs and finding
people that I could represent and bring

85
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,280
in,
maybe get deals for them.

86
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,260
And that quickly transitioned to moving
to another company where I was doing

87
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,280
comedy development and then I quickly
fell back into being an agent.

88
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,510
So that was like my first career was
like going to comedy clubs late at

89
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,290
night.
Um,

90
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,830
Eddie F two I think you know was your
first client.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,410
Yeah,
he was my very first client.

92
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,700
We still keep in touch.
He says hi.

93
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,120
And that was like my life.
So here I am now 24 25 working at a big

94
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,950
agency representing clients.
I was the youngest female agent like in

95
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,070
the department,
maybe even in the city at that time.

96
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,030
I don't,
it was really young,

97
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,820
got promoted really,
really super young and I was dating the

98
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,450
head of a movie studio and I was living
this amazing Hollywood life,

99
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,350
like making a lot of money,
going to the Oscars and Golden Globes,

100
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,120
private jets,
hanging out with celebrities.

101
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:29,950
Like I totally had it all,
but I still wasn't happy.

102
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,500
It was like I had achieved one thing and
then there had to be the next thing and

103
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,060
then I just leave this and then it had
to be,

104
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,200
next thing you know,
I'd get the guy,

105
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,920
I still wouldn't be happy.

106
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,730
I get the promotion still.
I was on that constant chase and nothing

107
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,731
ever was like doing it.
So about two years I did this job,

108
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm still on antidepressants.
I'm also taking antianxiety pills at the

109
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:52,090
time and just like trying to like manage
my life.

110
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,300
And I was one of those people that I
could really look good from the outside,

111
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,720
I could seem like I had it all together
and the inside was a totally different

112
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,040
story.
It's Kinda like a duck on water,

113
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,970
you know,
it looks smooth,

114
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,480
but underneath it's like that's,
that was what I was like.

115
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,000
And you know,
a lot of people ask me about how to

116
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,390
achieve all this and still like suffer
from depression.

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,870
And I was a very functional,
depressed person.

118
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,580
Like a lot of people think if you're
depressed,

119
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,680
you just lay in bed all day and watch,
you know,

120
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:21,850
soap operas or something.

121
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,400
But that's not the,
that doesn't,

122
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,990
you know,
summarize all depression.

123
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,830
Like there's different ways it shows up.
And so I was able to live my life,

124
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,480
but I always felt like something was
missing.

125
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,510
I always felt like I wasn't enough and I
just had this heavy,

126
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,840
heavy energy and an and nothing I could
achieve whatever,

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,900
filling that gap.
So let me keep going.

128
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,540
So,
uh,

129
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,740
one day I was riding up in the elevator
to work and I had basically a mini panic

130
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:51,940
attack.
I just,

131
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:55,690
I couldn't breathe.
I got off the elevator and I just

132
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,520
couldn't catch my breath and was looking
at,

133
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,300
there was a lot of weird folk painting
and art in our office and I was looking

134
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:07,100
at the weird photos and the one outside
of my desk was this woman in a negligee

135
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:11,570
who is nine months pregnant in this huge
yard sale with a Ufo light shining down

136
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,860
on her about to take her up

137
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,560
and I'm moving again at this painting.
I feel like that's me.

138
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:18,300
How did I get you

139
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,380
here?
And I just,

140
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,640
I wa I went back down the elevator,
walked around Beverly Hills and then

141
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:26,040
came back upstairs and I just wanted to
quit.

142
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,330
All I wanted to do was quit.
I thought that was the answer.

143
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:31,110
It was just I could quit my job and
reinvent myself and start over,

144
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,180
but I needed someone to give me
permission.

145
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,240
And so I called my dad because my dad
is,

146
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,490
has always been there for me and like,
Dad,

147
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,800
I really want to quit this job,
can I?

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,620
And He did a really good dad thing,
really pissed me off at the time,

149
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:45,780
but it was a good dad move.
You want to guess what he did?

150
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,890
Told you get your shit together.
Hello?

151
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,150
Said I love you but I can't make this
decision for you.

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,700
That is a good dad thing.
Yeah.

153
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,660
Get Dad thing.
And he hung up and I quit the next day

154
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:07,020
and that was the first really big risk I
ever took.

155
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,820
Why did you feel you are the pregnant
woman with a Ufo about to take you off

156
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,380
in a flying saucer that

157
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,850
Pelican fused and lost and like,
I didn't fit in and like chaos and it's

158
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,380
all wrong.
And how did I get here and what has

159
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,200
happened?

160
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,470
Isn't it crazy that Hollywood has so
many stories?

161
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,370
I mean,
not obviously,

162
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,490
not exactly like yours,
but so many stories of people who were

163
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:32,960
rejected and who have decided they're
going to come here to prove something or

164
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,960
to get the love that they need.
And what do they run into?

165
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,050
They're in the business of rejection for
every,

166
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,960
most people don't really think about it
because most people don't act.

167
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,360
But if you try to act,
you have to audition.

168
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:46,730
And if you audition,
you're going to audition with hundreds

169
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,190
of other people.
They're all trying to get the same job

170
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:52,250
and they treat you like hundreds of
other people were trying to get the same

171
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,700
job.
It's the weirdest thing and people leave

172
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,950
and they're just devastated.
They're so confused.

173
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,070
They get nervous before the thing and
then they leave the thing and they feel

174
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,490
so helpless.
Yeah,

175
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,030
it's the,
it's a strange,

176
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,470
strange business.
Yep.

177
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,120
Really is and it's,
it's so often not based on talent.

178
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,610
No,
it's so often not based on who's the

179
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:15,280
best person for the job and that's what
frustrated me as an agent.

180
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,540
And also one of the reasons I left the,
had a deal that I put together,

181
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,560
he was actually involved in it and my
boss made me attach a show runner who

182
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:26,290
like nobody wanted and,
but he needed the police,

183
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,780
that client and it killed the show and
it killed these guys.

184
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,640
The opportunity

185
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,420
all the time,
all the time in the US.

186
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,850
When I took over the man show,
there was a showrunner that there's

187
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,180
this,
this weird incestuous sort of fucking

188
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:41,310
business in Hollywood of connecting
people.

189
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,290
It's almost more about being social than
it is about anything else.

190
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,930
It's about making these relationships
almost like politics.

191
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,760
You become beholden to these people and
you get them jobs and they get you jobs

192
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:56,130
and you all just feed off of each and
y'all suck.

193
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,720
It really happens a lot.
It happens a lot with comedy writers.

194
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,090
Yup.
There's a lot of comedy writers that are

195
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:04,370
just,
you know,

196
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
they're,
they might've even been on Seinfeld or

197
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:09,180
something,
like a great show and there's a few

198
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,460
brilliant writers and there's a few that
are like,

199
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,500
what in the fuck is this guy doing here?
Well,

200
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,310
his agent is this guy's agent and that
guy's agent force this guy in.

201
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,230
If you get that guy,
you get this guy too.

202
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,400
And they make these deals.

203
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,730
Exactly.
And that's what was so frustrating for

204
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:25,760
me is I'd have these really talented
people and I couldn't,

205
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,750
I couldn't get them jobs.

206
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,170
Why did they put you on Prozac at 10
did?

207
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,460
Were you an only child?
No,

208
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:30,701
no,
no.

209
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,040
I was the oldest.
You're the oldest.

210
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,180
How many kids?
Just to,

211
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,420
and I think,
you know,

212
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,090
my,
my parents loved me a lot and they just

213
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,430
were doing the best they could and they
were listening to doctors.

214
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,510
You know,
it was a time when,

215
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:44,010
if a doctor tells you something,
you listen,

216
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,430
what was bombing you out?
Like do you,

217
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,840
like what did,
what was it the point where they were

218
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,460
willing to put you on medication?

219
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,950
Well,
I think I went from,

220
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:55,951
when I was little,
I was really outgoing and talkative and

221
00:09:56,111 --> 00:10:00,010
happy.
And then when the teasing and bullying

222
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:02,890
started to happen,
I completely just shut down.

223
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,640
Like I shut off a particular group of
people that did it to one girl and then

224
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:09,760
it like kind of bitch.
Well she's the one I wanted to mention

225
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:12,300
when I won my Oscar that was,
oh,

226
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,630
you wanted to get up there and say this
is right.

227
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,080
You know?
Eventually I got over that.

228
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,220
Uh,
but I just,

229
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,700
I really just shut down and withdrew.
And

230
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,040
so it was just like,
did you move to a different school or

231
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,380
was it just one particular kid?

232
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,100
They wanted me,
my parents were like,

233
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:28,130
go to a different school,
honey.

234
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,690
Like,
yeah.

235
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,070
And I just wouldn't,
I was,

236
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,710
I was stubborn and I wanted to stay and
I think I was just scared,

237
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,731
you know,
that's the thing,

238
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:37,060
like,
oftentimes what we know that's,

239
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,380
that's bad is safer,
feel safer than what we don't know that

240
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:44,410
might be better.
I had a comfort zone and where I was

241
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,970
like,
even though I wasn't really happy,

242
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:47,620
like I knew that school,
I knew,

243
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,480
I was afraid that if I went to new
school,

244
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,340
I would just have to deal with the same
thing.

245
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,680
So I was just like,
I'll just stay where I am.

246
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,270
Isn't it crazy that you could run into
the wrong person when you're 10 years

247
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,910
old and it can fuck you up for a decade
or two?

248
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

249
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,550
But I think we,
I mean,

250
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,900
I don't know any human who hasn't had
something in childhood or adulthood or

251
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,890
whatever that is.
We can call bad jamie.

252
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,140
We'll get them perfect.
Nothing's ever went wrong.

253
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,580
Nothing's ever gone wrong with you.
Just wait.

254
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:15,170
It's coming in too

255
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,420
smooth and calm young.
Jamie's collected.

256
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,621
Yeah.
No,

257
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,770
everybody's had difficulties.
Yeah,

258
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,220
it's unavoidable.
But the w the,

259
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,910
the bullying thing is very,
it's,

260
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,210
it's very strange how prevalent it is
and how it seems to be a part of human

261
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:35,211
nature that people have some strange
desire to find someone who's weak or

262
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:40,911
who's insecure or who is,
and then literally go after them and put

263
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:43,050
yourself in front of them and fuck with
them and,

264
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,160
and ruin their life.
Their,

265
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,030
she,
let's go get her.

266
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,040
Like that kind of shit is,
it's a weird natural pattern that human

267
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,020
beings follow.
And I've always wondered like,

268
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,680
we need to talk to Gad sad about this.
Like what is the evolutionary basis for

269
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,290
that?
Like what is it about people that makes

270
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,510
them want to do that?
Especially young people.

271
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,201
I don't,
you know,

272
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:06,110
and I think it's different with the way
girls do it in the way boys do it.

273
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,460
How do girls do it?
Girls?

274
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,510
It's a little more sneaky and I think a
lot of times it's based more on jealousy

275
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:13,520
and that might have like,
I don't know,

276
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:16,190
that might have some unattractive,
no,

277
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:17,750
I think that,
um,

278
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,430
I was,
I was smart.

279
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:21,410
School came easy for me.
The teachers really like me.

280
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:24,410
Parents liked me.
And so I think that that might have had

281
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,000
something to do with it.
And again,

282
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,980
I don't know,
you know,

283
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,450
it's 10 like I have no idea why they did
what they did,

284
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:33,620
but it was more sneaky like passing
around notes saying I joined the,

285
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,830
I hate Christine club and like having
everyone sign it and,

286
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:40,450
and just kind of quietly doing it behind
my back and,

287
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,030
and pulling all my friends away where I
think boys are just more aggressive.

288
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,620
Like they'll,
they'll beat you up,

289
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,360
they'll put you in lockers,
they'll do that,

290
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,730
that kind of thing.
But I think it's just a,

291
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,230
a power thing and you know,
within every bully as a scared little

292
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,210
boy or little girl.
So it's just,

293
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,970
I think how we're always,
not always,

294
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:01,370
but so much of the time we're trying to
compensate for something,

295
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,200
you know,
where we feel less than where we feel

296
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,660
insecure.
We think if we can just have power over

297
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,140
something or somebody else that's gonna
make us feel better.

298
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,720
There's also a thing that happens when
like the,

299
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:13,450
I hate Christine Club thing where the
other girls were probably like,

300
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,720
I don't want to be on the end of that,
so I'm going to join in.

301
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,890
Yup.
You get,

302
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,640
you get scared that they're going to go
after you next and you want to be on the

303
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,440
mean team.
I think that's what's going on with

304
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,330
Donald Trump.
I really do.

305
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,070
I think that's a lot of the reason why
people are with him and,

306
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,380
and,
and for him,

307
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,730
he's,
he's so vindictive and mean and he,

308
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,190
the way he goes after people,
I think you see a lot of people support

309
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,160
him and sort of like,
like cower to him.

310
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,830
Yeah.
Like even that Megan Kelly chick who's a

311
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:46,720
super brassy Badass ice princess,
she did that interview with him after

312
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,450
they had their little thing when she sat
down with them and she was,

313
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,590
she was so like submissive.
Who was weird.

314
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:54,221
It was,
I mean,

315
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,230
maybe we should try to keep her job.
Maybe Fox News,

316
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,130
right?
Or the riot act,

317
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:00,580
I don't know.
But it was really bizarre to watch her

318
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,260
tone down.
Do you ever see it,

319
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,090
see the followup interviews this year?
She didn't call him out on anything.

320
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,600
Thanks.
You just not really,

321
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,820
no.
She was really submissive.

322
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,811
Hmm.
It was,

323
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:12,510
it was not what I expected it was.
It was very orchestrated.

324
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,880
I mean,
I think it was kind of obvious at that

325
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:15,780
point.
I don't know if he had,

326
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,500
he was the nominee or he was on his way.
It looks like all the other nominees

327
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:20,640
were falling apart.
Yeah.

328
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,050
And um,
she did this interview with her and him

329
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:29,100
sat in some office room,
like sat across from a table and it was

330
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:29,910
like,
they're like,

331
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,240
people are scared.
Yeah.

332
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,700
People scared of,
of,

333
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,500
you know,
the,

334
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,640
the strong man or the strong woman,
you know,

335
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:35,941
the,
the,

336
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,860
the person who's going to go after you

337
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,980
or the unpredictable,
like I think Donald is so unpredictable.

338
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,840
You never know what he's going to throw
at you.

339
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,500
And He,
yeah.

340
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,020
He will go to whatever length he needs
to go to,

341
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:49,020
to humiliate,
to make you feel less than to,

342
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,380
to throw you off your game.
Yeah.

343
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,610
You know,
so probably was just like,

344
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,900
I better just,

345
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,790
well,
he just,

346
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,220
he sues so many people and so many
people sue him.

347
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,810
He's,
that's his world,

348
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,710
you know,
and that's,

349
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,260
that's like a normal thing for him.
If he doesn't have a bunch of lawsuits

350
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:05,410
floating around the world,
he probably feels like nothing is even

351
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:06,520
happening today.
You know,

352
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,510
they're going to got to get something
going.

353
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,490
I got to sue somebody.
That's crazy.

354
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,480
But I think that,
that,

355
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,890
that is one of the reasons why people
like are attracted to him because they

356
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:17,590
don't want to be on his bad side.
I think people are terrified of him,

357
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,700
you know,
super billionaire,

358
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,690
very famous,
big,

359
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,700
powerful guy.
I think,

360
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:25,300
um,
there's a bunch of people that,

361
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,800
uh,
like with this,

362
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,920
I hate Christine Club.
If there was this one mean bitch.

363
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,720
Yeah.
That just wanted to go after you.

364
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:35,950
There's probably a bunch of people that
would want to side with her just because

365
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:39,370
they're scared that she's going to turn
on them and start going after them next.

366
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,020
I think that's probably right.
Yeah,

367
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:41,854
for sure.
Right.

368
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,080
It's total,
it's,

369
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,010
it's a tribal thing.
It's good.

370
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,230
Becomes this weird like that.
So that's our leader now.

371
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:48,160
You got to,
you know,

372
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,980
yeah.
A lot of leaders are the most vicious,

373
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,120
mean,
nasty,

374
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:53,800
terrifying people.
You know,

375
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:57,400
look at the dictators in Russia or Putin
or Kim Jong.

376
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,750
Ooh.
Or what are they known for?

377
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,160
The dictators and a lot of these Middle
Eastern countries,

378
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,590
they're fucking ruthless,
ruthless people yet.

379
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,550
And everyone's scared of him.
So they all go behind them,

380
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:06,940
you know?

381
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,440
Yep.
Better to be behind them.

382
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,720
Then you go up against them to feel the
wrath.

383
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,441
Yep.
Yeah.

384
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:14,830
I think fear is a big motivator,
unfortunately.

385
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,220
Yes.
And it I think impacts our ability to

386
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:22,840
really think clearly about something
because we're just so scared and so

387
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:26,080
threatened that we,
we stopped questioning,

388
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,580
wait a second,
like what is he really saying?

389
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:29,370
What does he really leading me to?
Yeah,

390
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,600
yeah.
Cause that's the thing with Donald and I

391
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,220
talked to people who support him.
I'm like,

392
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:34,054
but do you,
do you,

393
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,630
do you understand?
Like he would have more money if he

394
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,120
would have just like taken the money.
His father left him,

395
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,240
invested it versus all the bankrupting.
He's done.

396
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,080
I mean,
the keys,

397
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,040
there's just so much that doesn't make
sense about him yet.

398
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,010
I'm just like,
okay,

399
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,873
well

400
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,120
there's never been a man alive that
needs mushrooms more than Donald Trump

401
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,530
is.
There is.

402
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,940
I haven't heard of them.
I mean,

403
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,130
I'm sure.
I'm sure there probably has been,

404
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:59,780
but he needs him.
I think he needs to go straight to the

405
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:00,880
Amazon.
Yeah,

406
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:03,280
you might need to go right there,
but he needs something.

407
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,350
Yeah.
It's just he's,

408
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,640
he's almost like the super impulsive
hubris character.

409
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,301
Yeah.
You know,

410
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:13,420
everything is like a,
when Hillary Clinton says,

411
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:14,770
you know,
he doesn't pay taxes because she goes,

412
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,420
I'm smart.
Like he can't help.

413
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:18,970
Like you're on the deer out of fucking
debate on TV.

414
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,530
Yeah.
You said you're smart because you don't

415
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:21,760
pay taxes.
Right.

416
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,321
Me Reflect,
reflected me.

417
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:24,370
It's not just him,
like,

418
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:28,150
it really reflects like where we are as
a society,

419
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:32,560
that enough people support him to get
him to the place that he is.

420
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:35,140
I think we're so polarized right now and
like,

421
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,610
look,
I don't really love either candidate,

422
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,200
to be honest.
I just don't.

423
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,710
But I think that,
I hope that maybe this is just wishful

424
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:44,140
thinking that we'll have four years of
whoever it is.

425
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:48,670
I think it will be Hillary,
and then in the next election we'll have

426
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:52,350
people that we're actually excited about
supporting and voting for.

427
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,180
That may be,
but I don't see those people anywhere.

428
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,470
Yeah.
Do we want for the job?

429
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,790
Exactly.
What one wants the job.

430
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,850
That's the problem.
It's a crazy job and it's a job where

431
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,520
the just try to destroy you if you run
for it,

432
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,520
you know,
and you're seeing that with,

433
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,950
with trump and you're seeing that with
hillary and they're pulling out all the

434
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:13,390
stops and by the time it's over,
the opinion of the commander in chief,

435
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,420
it's going to be terrible no matter who
wins.

436
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,460
Right.
I mean there,

437
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,860
I mean that crooked hillary thing is
going to stick forever.

438
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,740
Hashtag Crooked Hillary,
it's going to stick forever.

439
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,920
And People's opinion of him is horrible.
You know?

440
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,810
It's no matter who wins and she's going
to win,

441
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:31,690
most likely.
But it's not good.

442
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,610
It's not good for any of us.
Nope.

443
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,510
It doesn't represent what we think of
the United States says we think of the

444
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:42,370
United States is being this unbelievable
place of creativity and innovation and

445
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,710
the greatest super power of the world's
ever known.

446
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:47,130
And this,
you know,

447
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:50,380
it's really progressive force for good
in the world.

448
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:51,580
And you know,

449
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,440
I don't know,
maybe we need to go through this time

450
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:58,730
though to shake it up a little bit.
Maybe things need to get bad to get

451
00:18:58,731 --> 00:18:59,410
better.
I mean,

452
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,780
and I see that in human psychology so
much do you need,

453
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:04,700
you need to hit rock bottom.
You need to go through these hard times

454
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,600
to have something better emerge that
maybe that's just wishful thinking.

455
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,240
No,
I think you're probably right.

456
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,300
I think we also needed to understand
because the wiki leaks,

457
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,860
um,
revelations,

458
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:19,030
like how exactly politics is run even
with the people we think that are the

459
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:22,390
good folks.
Like it's all fucking gross and dirty

460
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:25,360
and all the stuff with the Clinton
Foundation and all the stuff they did to

461
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:28,750
Bernie sanders and they conspired to
keep that guy out.

462
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,531
And there's,
I mean,

463
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:31,420
he's a Democrat too.
There are whole,

464
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,340
the whole thing was supposed to be about
who is the person that best represents

465
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:41,341
the people with the people choose.
But now the Democratic National

466
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,070
Committee was fucking working to make
sure that Bernie Sanders wasn't the guy.

467
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,080
Yeah,
and they were all conspiring with

468
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:50,500
Hillary and they're all pulling favors.
This is like we were talking about

469
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:54,160
before with producers and networks.
It's the same shit.

470
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,700
It's just using your power and your
influence and all the friends that

471
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:00,940
you've made in all the years and all the
favors and pulling it together.

472
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,350
But now we're being exposed to it in a
way that we haven't really,

473
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,590
since Watergate.
Watergate gave us like a little window,

474
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:11,830
a tiny little window,
but the access to information was so

475
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:15,730
minuscule back then.
Like we clung to those 15 minutes of

476
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,080
whatever,
Watergate tapes,

477
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,090
whatever it was.
And we were like,

478
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,020
look at this.
Oh,

479
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,300
I'm not a crook.
You know,

480
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:25,190
like he,
he was doing what they were all doing.

481
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,030
He just got caught and we got a,
we got a sense of it now.

482
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,630
But now when you read these emails about
how they really feel about each other

483
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,150
and all the fucking gross nist that goes
on and

484
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,100
oh no,
I try to not engage too much in the

485
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:40,200
gross ness cause it's just like what's
the point?

486
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,950
Guess the point is to understand what
the world really is about.

487
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,430
What the structure of government that
looms over us is really all about.

488
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,060
Why are certain things legal,
why a certain things illegal,

489
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:58,000
why are certain loopholes in place,
how did they get in place?

490
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,940
Who benefits from them?
What is a charity?

491
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,550
And if it is a charity,
how come you get paid so much?

492
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,340
Yeah.
Like how come you get paid $250,000 to

493
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,430
speak and then all this money goes to
your charity.

494
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:13,420
But that $250,000 goes to you.
But you just talked for an hour.

495
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:14,680
Like this is a scam.

496
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,240
But that's the thing.
Like you're asking,

497
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,010
you're being curious,
you're being curious,

498
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,860
you're asking questions.
And I think that's helpful.

499
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,760
I think what so many people are doing
are just getting mad and just trash

500
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,980
talking America and the the candidates
and,

501
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,200
and that doesn't do any good for
anybody.

502
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,280
If you want to like ask questions and
get involved and start to get curious

503
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,330
and quest,
that's,

504
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,370
that's awesome.
That's how we change things.

505
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,270
But I think too much of this has just
been so emotionally driven that people

506
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:42,280
are just getting upset and not really
going,

507
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,150
Huh,
what can I do?

508
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:46,150
What can I learn?
How can I shift this in some way?

509
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,160
Yeah.
It's also people are like super psyched

510
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:53,010
to get behind their candidate,
their team.

511
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,140
I got to tell you like there's a lot of
gross this on both sides for sure.

512
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,270
There's a lot of gross on the trump
side.

513
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:04,030
There's a lot of mean assholes that have
finally found another mean asshole

514
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,200
that's run for president and they're
pumped like he's one of them.

515
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
But then there's a lot of men who are
using Hashtag I'm with her and they're

516
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,550
the grossest little fucking white
nights.

517
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,760
Oh my God.
I've run across a few of them on

518
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:19,680
twitter,
like the White Knight.

519
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,960
You don't know what a white knight is,
how dare you.

520
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,700
You really don't know like a knight in
shining armor.

521
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:26,100
Yes.
A man comes along,

522
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,190
it comes along and positions himself as
the superior morally superior to call

523
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,740
Michael Shermer calls.
Virtue signaling.

524
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,810
If someone who would would say,
you know,

525
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:38,940
Hashtag I'm with her Hashtag male
feminist,

526
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,820
you know,
Hashtag [inaudible] that's real.

527
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,220
There's a lot of those out there.
Yeah,

528
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,680
they,
they're trying hard.

529
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,840
They couldn't get laid in the other way,
and this is,

530
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,500
this is the strategy there was the
strategy is to position themselves as

531
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,930
the super progressive.
Yeah.

532
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,020
It's like people who don't want you to
think that they're racist,

533
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,470
so they go out of their way to
discriminate against white people,

534
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,230
other white people when they're white.
I read this thing with this woman was

535
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:06,630
saying,
if you are a white person and you were

536
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:10,170
up for a job and you are up against a
person of color,

537
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,860
do period not period,
take that job.

538
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,160
You don't deserve it.
Examine white privilege.

539
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,810
I was like,
oh my God,

540
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,180
what Liberal Arts College do you belong
to?

541
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:24,750
What fucking crazy shit is in your head.
Like what?

542
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,900
I don't get it at all.
Do period.

543
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,490
Not Period.
Take that job.

544
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,470
Hi.
Yeah.

545
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,020
Well you don't have to get it.
We went on a tangent and went off.

546
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:39,270
We were trying to find out how you
become a life coach and all of a sudden

547
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:40,260
you're talking politics.

548
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,880
Yeah.
White Knights.

549
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,570
I love it.
I lockers.

550
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,570
Jets.
Yeah.

551
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,360
And now,
now I know a whole new understanding of

552
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:48,194
white nights.
Well,

553
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,840
I always understood it as you know that
the man who's going to come in and

554
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,280
rescue,

555
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
that's that.
But they're positioning themselves as

556
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:53,940
that.
But that,

557
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,670
yeah,
I think we're a couple decades away from

558
00:23:56,671 --> 00:24:00,570
all this going away because I think
technology is going government going

559
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:02,370
away,
all bullshit,

560
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,930
all bullshit and lies.
This is where ups,

561
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:08,520
so I really believe this.
I think technology is going to enable

562
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,610
just like no one anticipated.
You know,

563
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:15,360
as you can go back to the f,
the first days of cameras,

564
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:17,790
if you went to act in the 18 hundreds
and they first had a camera,

565
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,490
yeah.
No one would have ever thought did in

566
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:23,100
the lifespan of just,
I mean what was the first camera,

567
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:25,800
Jamie?
Like 1860 something like that.

568
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:29,070
Like civil war era was like the first
cameras.

569
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,620
No one would've ever thought that in two
lifespans,

570
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,680
which is essentially what it is.
From then to now,

571
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,180
you would be able to send video to
Australia instantaneously from something

572
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:44,670
that slips into your pocket.
I think it's like stop

573
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,880
to think about how much we've seen in
our lifetime.

574
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,860
Yeah,
I think we're just so used to it.

575
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,360
Yeah.
We're so used to google and the

576
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:53,930
Internet.
When Hillary Clinton was a telling like

577
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:55,490
Donald Trump said something and she's
like,

578
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:56,870
Google it.
Google what?

579
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,130
He said,
it's not true,

580
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,490
and I was like,
how hilarious is that Hillary Clinton is

581
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,010
telling people to Google Donald Trump?
Like,

582
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,890
like that's,
that's how beautiful access to

583
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:08,570
information is today.
Yeah.

584
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,430
I think we are a couple of decades,
maybe a little bit more away from a

585
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:18,431
completely new paradigm,
a completely new way of accessing

586
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,320
information.
I think we're going to submit to

587
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:24,410
something,
whether it's a neural implant or some

588
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:28,280
sort of a augmented reality,
and we're going to be able to read

589
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:30,410
intention and thoughts.
It's going to be,

590
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:33,020
there's not going to be any lying and on
a hundred years.

591
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,883
I really believe that.

592
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,120
Totally think you're right.
And I think that's why we're seeing so

593
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:39,150
many of these systems breakdown,
like the presidential election,

594
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:41,520
which,
which used to be this coveted amazing

595
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:43,680
thing.
Now we're kind of looking at it as like,

596
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:45,210
it's,
it's a reality TV show.

597
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,490
That's what it seems like now.

598
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,800
It's all pussy grabbing,
craziness,

599
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,120
craziness.
That's the,

600
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,870
I mean,
I just believe that

601
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,600
first,
like 20 minutes in the second debate,

602
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,100
oh,
I had been out of the country for a

603
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,560
month,
which was so refreshing and to come back

604
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,260
and I watched it and the first 20
minutes was just character slams.

605
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:07,860
It was nothing about nothing about the
issues or anything.

606
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:08,694
And I was just like,
what?

607
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,610
What's,
what's happening?

608
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,820
That doesn't make me happy.
Like,

609
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:15,600
it doesn't make me feel like if he shits
on her or she shits on him and she tears

610
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,640
him down,
it doesn't make me feel like she's

611
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,800
better.
I liked her in one of the debates

612
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,790
because I didn't tune into it until the
last like hour and he was saying a bunch

613
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,560
of crazy shit and she would start
laughing.

614
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,200
I was like,
that's how she should handle him.

615
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:30,360
Yeah.
She should handle him like he's a child.

616
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,620
Yeah.
Like if she did that,

617
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:36,621
but she's fucking crazy too.
So change depending president.

618
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,820
Another tangent.
Lots of life coaching.

619
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:42,980
Get that.
How do,

620
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,100
how do you go from,

621
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,520
all right,
so when you're were mad at both of us,

622
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:48,354
by the way,
I'm sorry.

623
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,570
Shoot about poetics.
Yeah.

624
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,700
How about you just shut the fuck up.
I will totally own that.

625
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,260
I,
that's not my area of expertise.

626
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,330
So guess what?
Nobody knows shit about politics.

627
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,370
Even the people doing it.
That's why Donald Trump's running for

628
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,860
fucking president.
Nobody saw that common.

629
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,930
You know what?
Nobody understands this stupid system.

630
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,300
Yeah.
But You understand life coaching or

631
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,390
we're going to come up with a better
name.

632
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,100
So life coaching.
Yes,

633
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,620
but so the way it happened

634
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,580
is,
um,

635
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,080
all right.
So I quit my job,

636
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,280
which threw me into an even worse
depression because that was my whole

637
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,040
identity.
Like it was my success in being an

638
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,960
agent.
And so then in a period of,

639
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:25,370
I don't know,
like six to eight months,

640
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,950
a bunch of things happened,
I went into lots of debt because I tried

641
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:30,260
to keep up with this lifestyle.
I,

642
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:33,200
um,
was a strange for my family for a bit,

643
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,150
cause I made a choice that they didn't
really like.

644
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,770
And I got diagnosed with another
autoimmune disorder on top of everything

645
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:41,990
else.
And then I was engaged and thought,

646
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,280
oh,
I'm going to be a wife.

647
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:45,680
Like that's my next role.
I'll be fine.

648
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,590
And then six months before my wedding,
he dumped me culturally.

649
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,020
So I it not,
you know,

650
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,550
I know people listening have been
through worse,

651
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:57,530
but in that like span at 26 years old,
losing my career and money and family

652
00:27:57,531 --> 00:28:02,030
and health and love,
it was kind of like this sucks like

653
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:02,810
this.

654
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,920
I really didn't know what to do.
And I had honestly a moment on my

655
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,990
bathroom floor,
which I don't know why it was on my

656
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,160
bathroom floor,
it was disgusting,

657
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:12,410
but she was laying there.
It's a good spot to cry.

658
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:14,450
The tiles are nice and cold,
you know,

659
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,540
it feels very dramatic.
And I had this like kind of insight,

660
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,490
I guess you could say of how much I was
relating to everything as a total victim

661
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,960
as like everything was happening to me.
And then it dawned on me,

662
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,890
I'm the common denominator in like all
of these situations.

663
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,120
So either I have just really bad luck or
I have some influence over this.

664
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,960
And again,
like it was just a teeny bit of an

665
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:48,500
insight,
but it was enough of a new perspective

666
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:52,550
on my life that kind of got me off the
bathroom floor and started to give me

667
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:57,020
some kind of hope and started to make me
realize I needed help.

668
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,240
And like I,
the way I was doing my life wasn't going

669
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:02,240
to work anymore.
And so I found,

670
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:07,280
I thought I was having a quarter life
crisis and I found a book by that name

671
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:10,580
and I read it and it was fine,
but it wasn't going deep enough for me.

672
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,020
So I decided to write a book about my
experience and everything I was learning

673
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:18,680
and um,
how I like was getting myself off my

674
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:19,820
bathroom floor,
I guess.

675
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,680
And I was interviewing people for the
book and they kept saying things to me

676
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,600
like,
can I set up a session with you?

677
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,531
And I'd say,
why?

678
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:28,880
I got all the information.
And they said,

679
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:30,530
why aren't you a coach or a counselor or
something?

680
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:32,360
And I'd say no.
And they said,

681
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,290
you should be,
you should be,

682
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,130
you should be,
should be.

683
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,260
And I kept hearing this over and over
and over again.

684
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,190
So I went to my coach and kind of my
first teacher who I met when I was 22

685
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:43,120
and I was still seeing,
and she has had a major impact in my

686
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:44,140
life.
And I said,

687
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:44,561
Mona,
you know,

688
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:48,100
everybody's telling me I should do this
and I've been looking for my career for

689
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:49,270
you know,
years and maybe this is what I'm

690
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,650
supposed to do.
She's like,

691
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,910
Yup,
Yup,

692
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,440
that's what you're supposed to do.
And I go out,

693
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,120
I've been coming for five years,
like,

694
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:57,190
why didn't you tell me this?
And she said,

695
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,180
you know,
you had to figure it out,

696
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,300
you had to find it.
And so that's how it just started.

697
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,130
Like people kept reflecting back to me,
hey,

698
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:04,420
you're good at this,
he should do this.

699
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:07,900
And I didn't really know how or what.
And so then I just became,

700
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,180
I started studying it,
I prentice with her,

701
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,160
I got training,
I got a master's degree,

702
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:16,900
I wrote more books.
And it just sort of happened out of my

703
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:20,800
own life and out of just creating things
that I thought would help people and

704
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:22,780
people going,
actually this is really helping me and

705
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,490
can I talk to you more?
And that was,

706
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:25,660
you know,
a good 10,

707
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:26,530
11 years ago.

708
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,430
Have you pushed some mic forward a
little bit more and make the sounds

709
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,050
sorry.
It sounds good in your ear.

710
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,220
Just the recording.
It will be.

711
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:36,490
We got it.
Isn't that an interesting thing that um,

712
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,730
it's oftentimes small choices that
people make that dictate what happens to

713
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:45,250
them in their life.
But if you just decide that things are

714
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:47,830
happening to you,
you don't take any responsibility for

715
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:48,790
any of the choices.

716
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,940
That's to me the biggest difference are
people who are able to change their life

717
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,190
and people who don't is ownership is
realizing that yes,

718
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,910
things happen but we're not victims and
anything can happen.

719
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,890
But you,
the same exact thing happened to you and

720
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:05,990
I,
and we can make different choices about

721
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,570
what we make it mean and how we respond
to it and we're going to create

722
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:12,680
different results based on that.
So it's not what happens to people.

723
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:16,430
It's not just luck.
It's truly what are you going to choose

724
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:20,000
to believe about it.
And that's to me the key differentiator

725
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,680
between staying where you are and kind
of regressing as you get older and just

726
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:29,360
repeating your familiar patterns and,
and repeat life and more stubborn and

727
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:31,460
all those things.
And you know,

728
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:35,870
just looking for those short term bursts
of happiness and like a trip or a bottle

729
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:40,871
of wine or whatever versus like really
getting clear about how you can change

730
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,470
your life,
what your purpose is,

731
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:44,870
what brings you joy and like who you
really are.

732
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,890
There's a thing about life coaching to
or any,

733
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:52,891
but I mean just to forget that word,
but the idea that your dispensing advice

734
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:57,981
or giving out inspiration or you know,
writing things down that have affected

735
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,590
and helped enhanced you.
People want to dismiss that stuff.

736
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,131
Like,
oh,

737
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:03,960
I don't need that.
Oh that's nothing but right.

738
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:09,290
I feel like one of the best things about
being a part of a community or being a

739
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:14,310
part of a culture is that you get to
look at all of the things that people

740
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:15,810
have done,
that it benefited them,

741
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,370
and all of the,
the,

742
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:19,440
the positive choices that someone has
made.

743
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,590
And you can learn and experience those
without having to go through all their

744
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:23,424
bullshit.
Yeah.

745
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,160
You know,
and there,

746
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,550
there's a lot of things that I've
learned from people,

747
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:30,510
whether I've read things that they've
said or listen to speeches that they've

748
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:34,260
given about mistakes that they've made,
where I've come across a similar moment

749
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:35,060
in my life,
I'm like,

750
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,700
ah,
I've,

751
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,870
I know what this is.

752
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,790
I know what that is.
It's,

753
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,610
I think it's one of the best tools that
we have when,

754
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,920
when,
when it comes to improving and enhancing

755
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:49,940
your own life,
your own individual experience is

756
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,520
looking at all the different shit that
other people have done.

757
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,190
And it's,
it's a weird one because people dismiss

758
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:57,110
it so easily.
They don't,

759
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,640
first of all,
they dismiss it at a,

760
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,020
there's a certain amount of Hubris and a
certain amount of ego attached to it

761
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:06,710
where they don't want to admit they have
an issue or they don't want to admit

762
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:11,270
they need help or they don't want to
admit that they need to be inspired or

763
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,460
they need,
you know,

764
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,730
some sort of motivation.

765
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,790
I think it's,
yeah,

766
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,230
I think it's fear.
Yeah.

767
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:20,940
Back to that whole,
this life that I know is comfortable.

768
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:25,380
I may not like it,
but I'm so scared of uncertainty that I

769
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:29,610
don't want to make the changes.
People are terrified of the unknown.

770
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,690
There's also a lot of fuckery of foot
when it comes to life coaches and

771
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:38,470
motivational speakers.
And there's a lot of hosers like we were

772
00:33:38,471 --> 00:33:40,770
talking about before the podcast,
about a couple hosers.

773
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,200
We know there's hosers out there and
those people,

774
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,640
but it's like everything else,
like,

775
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,890
you know,
there's bad car mechanics,

776
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,350
you know,
they'll put a used part in your car and

777
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,720
fuck you over this.
There's bad doctors,

778
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:55,540
there's bad everything.
Everything in this world as someone

779
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,800
who's half asking it.
Yup.

780
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,240
And the problem with that whole,
the idea of being a life coach or being

781
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:04,660
a motivational speaker is that there's
not really,

782
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:06,520
like,
you don't have to get a phd to do it.

783
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,690
You don't have to,
you know,

784
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:11,170
you don't have to like prove yourself.
Like Mike has opened up 15 different

785
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:12,670
businesses,
so he's going to show you how to do a

786
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:15,190
business like this.
The guy's a successful businessman.

787
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,860
That makes sense.
But there's a lot of people out there

788
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:20,470
that are doing life coaching that are
fucking failures.

789
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,240
Yeah.
And maybe,

790
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:25,030
maybe that's not the worst thing in the
world to be a failure because you've

791
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:29,800
learned from those failures and maybe
your achievement or your contribution is

792
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,820
expressing those failures and your
revelations from those failures and that

793
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,100
could help somebody else not make those
same mistakes.

794
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,951
Yeah.
I mean,

795
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,500
I think I've had a lot of so called
failures and mistakes.

796
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,140
Um,
did you ever have one of those like

797
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,330
bathroom floor moments?
So it's like life pivot.

798
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,050
I'll a man,
first of all.

799
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,020
All right,
so check on the floor,

800
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,943
right?

801
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,020
Yeah.
I mean,

802
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,880
um,
no,

803
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,360
all bullshit aside.
Yeah.

804
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,320
Yeah.
There's always,

805
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,780
um,
for,

806
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,460
for a comic,
the big one is bombing.

807
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,710
Bombing on stage is devastating and you
start thinking like,

808
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:05,420
I can't,
I can't do this.

809
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:08,030
Like you can only take so many of those
bombings in your life.

810
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,380
Yeah.
It was like getting beaten up.

811
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:12,110
You can only get beaten up so many times
before,

812
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,790
like your brain stops working.
Right.

813
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,820
And there's that relationship breakups
for sure.

814
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Um,
devastations I think are always the best

815
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,060
for a rebirth.
Yup.

816
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,590
And at the time they don't feel like it.
No.

817
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,720
And devastations went to anything
devastating the habs do in your life

818
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:34,340
while it's happening.
You feel like,

819
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,920
I don't know if I can take this,
but then you get through it and you have

820
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:40,560
this sort of enhanced perspective and
then you also,

821
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,410
we live in an amazing time where you can
see,

822
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,180
you know,
not that you should revel in other

823
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,770
people's failures,
but you could like,

824
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:51,771
look what most of your failure is.
Nothing in comparison to what's going on

825
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,700
in a million like Syria or million
different parts of the world that are

826
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,830
just filled with fucking chaos.
Yeah.

827
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,900
Most people can't see that because you
see your life and your wife is all,

828
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:05,700
you know when your life is falling
apart.

829
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,660
Right.
Well and I think too,

830
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,960
you know,
we get so kind of narcissistic and our

831
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:15,910
problems that we forget the bigger
perspective and we don't,

832
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,380
a lot of people talk about being happy
all the time you should be.

833
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,630
And I just don't think that that's real.
I think that you,

834
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,990
I,
I've grown and I through contrast

835
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:25,960
through,
you know,

836
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:28,090
I,
I think I really understand happiness

837
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:31,120
and joy because I've really understood
depression and sadness.

838
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:35,020
Like that polarity I think is such a big
part of what we're here for.

839
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,370
Yeah.
I mean you can look at,

840
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,610
you read a book about different parts of
the world and what's going on.

841
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:40,740
You,
if you're still happy,

842
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,400
have to read that book to something
wrong with you.

843
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,970
You know,
like probably shouldn't be happy all the

844
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,110
time.
There was actually,

845
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,780
I think it was scientific America or
something like that that had an article

846
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:52,840
recently saying,
you're not going to be happy all the

847
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:54,750
time and you shouldn't be.
And there's a,

848
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,480
there's a reason for it.
There's peaks and valleys in everything

849
00:36:58,481 --> 00:36:59,060
in life.

850
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,580
Yup.
And that I,

851
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,540
you know,
for people listening that might be in

852
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,950
one of those valleys,
it's like,

853
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,930
don't try to just get through it,
really ask,

854
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,280
you know,
why,

855
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,210
what can I learn from this?
That was my biggest thing is I stopped

856
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:18,860
asking why is this happening to me?
And started asking what can I learn?

857
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,450
Yeah.
So instead of painting yourself as a

858
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:23,240
victim,
you paint yourself as someone who

859
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,020
present in the moment and just,
okay,

860
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:26,310
I don't want to do this anymore.
Right?

861
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,510
Let's figure out what's going on.

862
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,500
Exactly.
And we don't,

863
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,170
a lot of times we don't have the tools
and that's where things like life

864
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,720
coaching and personal development come
in handy is Chris,

865
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:37,770
we can go and get those tools instead of
using our old coping mechanisms by like

866
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,080
being strong or overing,
overworking,

867
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:41,190
overdrinking over,
do,

868
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:42,840
you know,
jumping into a relationship,

869
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:44,160
like whatever it may be.
We,

870
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:48,420
we don't really learn how to deal with
disappointment,

871
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:49,520
failure,
anger,

872
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:50,880
or shame,
any of those things.

873
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:55,881
And so we're kind of left to these quick
fix devices that I think that's a big

874
00:37:56,101 --> 00:38:00,030
reason addiction is such a problem is
because we don't really learn how to

875
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,690
manage emotion and how to manage
disappointment.

876
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,360
And so we go for that thing that makes
us feel better in the moment.

877
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,880
But the problem is we have to keep
upping the ante.

878
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,870
You know,
at first that one glass of wine does the

879
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:14,310
trick,
but then you need to,

880
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:15,530
then you need three,
they need vodka,

881
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,860
whatever it may be.

882
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,420
And so,
I mean,

883
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,030
why I'm so passionate about what I do is
first of all,

884
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,750
I never,
I never thought I could be happy.

885
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,350
Like I really didn't.
I thought that this,

886
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,213
you know,
I,

887
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,600
I was going to be depressed and I just
was gonna constantly be looking for

888
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:38,601
something to fix me.
I never really truly thought this life

889
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:41,050
that I'm living now,
what is possible.

890
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,790
Again,
externally things look fine.

891
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:46,720
But internally I'm talking about a
totally different kind of experience and

892
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,500
it's only because of those like really
awful moments.

893
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:55,501
I call them expectation hangovers,
that I was kind of desperate enough to

894
00:38:55,751 --> 00:39:00,751
let go of my normal coping mechanisms
and my trying to control everything.

895
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:04,300
It was like the ultimate and surrender
truly of going okay.

896
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,800
Like I don't,
I don't know.

897
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,200
I need to find a different way to deal
with this.

898
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,010
And that's really what has led me down
the path that,

899
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,210
that I am today.
So,

900
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,153
you know,
I,

901
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,570
I think that life coaching and the
personal transformation industry and all

902
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,391
that,
like you said,

903
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,430
there's a lot of,
what'd you call him?

904
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,150
Hoke hokies.
Yeah.

905
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,340
Hosers oh,
sorry,

906
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,540
sorry.
It's Bob and Doug Mckenzie.

907
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,130
I don't even know who that is.
Fucking 1980s siren live character.

908
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,610
Oh,
coach posers.

909
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,880
They're from Canada.
Oh my God.

910
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,210
He hoser remember those guys.
I don't know why.

911
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,390
Why hosers learning all these words.
This is great.

912
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,420
Why hoser I don't know why that,
I hardly ever use that.

913
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,070
I don't know why it popped up.
I love it.

914
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,300
I want to go back to the the PROZAC.
Yeah,

915
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:49,711
yeah,
yeah.

916
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:52,560
Cause I'm super picky.
Your parents put you on that stuff when

917
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:54,770
you're 10 years old.
I think it was more the doctors.

918
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,623
Okay.
Your doctors,

919
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,860
your doctors put you on that stuff when
you were 10 this old block tests and ink

920
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,611
blot test.
Yeah.

921
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,160
You know,
what do you see a demon?

922
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:02,600
Yeah,
exactly.

923
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,500
What do you see?
Death.

924
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,261
Yeah.
What do you see?

925
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:07,470
A skull?
I probably said things like a butterfly.

926
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,390
I know that bitch.
I hate from school.

927
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:14,450
We'll fucking axe in her head.
So the doctor puts you on Prozac and

928
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,740
what kind of an effect does that have on
you?

929
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,880
I mean,
I actually helped.

930
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,250
It really helped.
I think it helped me.

931
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,650
Um,
I,

932
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,410
gosh,
it's so hard to remember too.

933
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:26,310
I mean,
I was 10,

934
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,930
but when I talked to my parents about
it,

935
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:28,471
they're like,
you know,

936
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:32,280
it did help because I really do think
that because of everything that

937
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:33,061
happened,
you know,

938
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:34,920
my brain chemistry did shift.
You know,

939
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:39,450
I do think that we can shift our brain
chemistry with repetitive thoughts and

940
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:41,400
you know,
I had enough thoughts about,

941
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,590
you know,
I'm not likable.

942
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,050
I had just intense inner critic in my
head.

943
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:48,060
And I do think that shifted my brain
chemistry.

944
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,480
And I do think that the medicine helped
me at least get to a point where,

945
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,250
you know,
I was like kind of awake again.

946
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,180
How long does on tank?
I don't remember,

947
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,370
but I know that,
you know,

948
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,950
especially in my twenties,
like I'm still on it.

949
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,600
Oh Gosh.
I was on it until 30.

950
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,640
Yeah.
I was on every,

951
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,280
from every,
I was on Prozac.

952
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:12,760
Welbutrin yeah.

953
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,600
Um,
years 20 from the time you were 10 so

954
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,030
all through high school you run that
stuff?

955
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,070
Yep.
Wow.

956
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,571
Yep.
I,

957
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:23,900
I believed that I needed it just like a
diabetic would take insulin.

958
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,950
So how long ago did you get off of it?
A seven and a half years ago.

959
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,111
Wow.
And,

960
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,830
and like,
totally,

961
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,630
I,
I never have any regression or dips,

962
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:38,300
but I did,
I was super intentional about getting

963
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:40,070
off of it.
I didn't just stop like,

964
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:43,490
especially after 20 years,
it took me a while.

965
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:48,020
It took a lot of the emotional work that
I was doing with my coach Mona,

966
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:50,270
because he know so much of depression is
suppression,

967
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,261
so,
you know,

968
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,970
and all that stuff was happening.
I,

969
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,180
I think I was pretty angry about it,
but I had no outlet for that.

970
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,630
Especially as a girl.
Like boys again can go out and get stuff

971
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:00,620
out.
But a lot of times,

972
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,280
and this is why I think so many women
get irritable and bitchy and all those

973
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:07,190
kinds of things is because women,
we don't have like that outlet for

974
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:07,670
anger.

975
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,200
And so we internalize a lot of that.
Like we can do sadness but anger a lot

976
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:17,201
of times get suppressed.
And so a lot of like me getting off my

977
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,340
medicine and not feeling depressed was
not being suppressed by exercise.

978
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,660
The exercise is okay,
but until you like go back and actually

979
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:29,060
process the emotion,
I mean exercise is good in terms of

980
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:32,270
moving the energy,
but a lot of times you have to attach

981
00:42:32,271 --> 00:42:34,160
like the feeling with the movement,
right?

982
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:37,820
So like a lot of my retreats that I do
where I just bring women,

983
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,720
I facilitate like an anger barn for them
where anger burn,

984
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,490
what does that,
it's like a safe place for women to get

985
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:47,900
their anger out.
Like,

986
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,300
and it's not just catharsis.
Like there's a whole kind of process

987
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,790
they put them through so they like,
you know,

988
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,230
kind of reconnect maybe earlier life
experiences where they didn't feel

989
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:59,330
protected or they felt unsafe or they
felt,

990
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,670
you know,
abused or whatever that is.

991
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,220
Because again,
like this is just,

992
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:06,770
this is all comes from my own life
experience in working with,

993
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,020
Gosh,
thousands of people at this point.

994
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,600
Like I,
I see over and over again.

995
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:14,930
People that are depressed,
shut down,

996
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:17,420
have a lot of anxiety,
not happy with their life,

997
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,660
have some like unprocessed thing from
their past that just needs to move.

998
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,830
And when I create this space for people
to start to move that energy,

999
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:32,831
it's like underneath there is creativity
and passion and peace and freedom from

1000
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:39,581
anxiety and all that kind of stuff.
So when you're looking at me like

1001
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,450
he's looking at me like,
who is this girl?

1002
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,630
Um,
so when people have that space to

1003
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:51,760
unleash that and to let the energy move
through them,

1004
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,050
because I think there's a difference
between emotion and feeling.

1005
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,770
So feelings to me,
our physiological responses to thoughts.

1006
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,100
Okay.

1007
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,100
So if I sit here and think about the
future of that I'm scared about,

1008
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:10,040
I'm going to feel anxiety.
If I have like,

1009
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,660
oh my gosh,
what if like someone breaks in my house

1010
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:13,040
tonight,
I'm going to feel fear.

1011
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,933
You know,
if I,

1012
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,730
I can,
I can feel regret because of a thought

1013
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,900
or guilt.
But,

1014
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,360
but emotion,
energy in motion.

1015
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:25,390
If someone hurts one of your kids,
you're going to experience anger.

1016
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,010
You know,
like it's a natural response.

1017
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,040
Someone close to us dies or we have a
heartbreak.

1018
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,390
It's natural to feel the emotion of
sadness.

1019
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,950
And I think that there's a lot of kind
of misleading information about like,

1020
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,500
oh,
we create all our feelings with our

1021
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,950
thoughts and we can just like affirm our
way out of things and think our way out

1022
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,470
of things.
And to some degree that's true.

1023
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,210
Changing our thinking does a lot,
but with some core emotions like anger,

1024
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,260
shame,
sadness,

1025
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:55,140
I think we've got to feel them.
And I think that that's what people are

1026
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:58,440
really scared of is actually kind of
opening that box,

1027
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:02,220
opening that can of worms and going back
and actually feeling those feelings.

1028
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:05,610
But the thing is they're in there and so
if you don't get them up and out in a

1029
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:08,370
healthy way,
then I think that's what creates a lot

1030
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:09,630
of depression,
a lot of depression,

1031
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:10,860
perhaps,
maybe even disease,

1032
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,860
things like that because they just get
stored in our body somewhere.

1033
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,150
It makes sense.
So what do you do to these gals?

1034
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,990
What do I do to these gals?
Um,

1035
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,320
I,
it's just creating a space that just

1036
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:27,570
scream,
well,

1037
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,090
no,
it's not a pillow fight.

1038
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,890
No,
it's not that I give them,

1039
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:34,260
I definitely give them something to hit
with like him,

1040
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,870
those foam noodles,
you know,

1041
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:39,210
that you do.
I do.

1042
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,670
And Oh gosh,
the comments to this,

1043
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:43,890
I'm going to be crazy.
I can't believe this,

1044
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:45,840
but here we go.
So I,

1045
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:49,800
um,
and I put on some pretty intense music.

1046
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,170
And again,
I don't even know,

1047
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,260
not slayer,
slayer after slayer,

1048
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,000
it's more like,
it's more like metallica.

1049
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,920
Metallica is on my playlist.
I'll,

1050
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,840
I can pull up my place later.
They really want to see it.

1051
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,380
Um,
you have a beat the shit out of a foam

1052
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:08,910
roller.
Oh,

1053
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:10,230
for sure.
Yeah.

1054
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,020
Cool.
Or burn or burn playlist.

1055
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

1056
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,450
Well,
I'm telling you actually.

1057
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,210
So one time I was doing this,
I rented a house actually out in the

1058
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,310
near here,
a Gore and people were doing this

1059
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:25,450
process and again,
like I prepped them like the,

1060
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,303
you know,
I,

1061
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,490
they,
they bring to mind things that they've

1062
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:30,480
maybe,
like I said,

1063
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,810
like we're angry about things from their
childhood,

1064
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,340
you know,
it's not just like a throw them in a

1065
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:37,050
room with loud music and say go after
it.

1066
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,861
Right.
They're very,

1067
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,560
there's a lot of processes I put them
through to get them to this point.

1068
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,720
But anyway,
so we're doing this one time in this

1069
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:46,110
house and there's like 20 women,
loud music,

1070
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:48,570
yelling and um,
the cops show up

1071
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,440
and
the guy's like,

1072
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,660
um,
what do you like?

1073
00:46:57,661 --> 00:46:59,610
What's going on here?
And I step out,

1074
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,860
I stepped out and I explained,
I said,

1075
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,020
you know,
a lot of times I,

1076
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,460
this is a women's workshop and a lot of
times,

1077
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:05,730
you know,
we,

1078
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,230
we hold back our emotions and you know,
we end up getting irritable and this

1079
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,990
just as healthy way for,
you know,

1080
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,260
people to,
to heal and work on their emotions.

1081
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,470
And the cop looks at me and he's like,
um,

1082
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,420
can I have your card?
I want to send my wife.

1083
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,790
No kidding.
That's what the cop said to me.

1084
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,210
So there's,
I've gotten lots of calls from husbands

1085
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:29,040
and boyfriends and even kids and like
thank you because there's something

1086
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,500
about,
it's like pulling off our armor

1087
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,240
honestly.
And there's something about doing like

1088
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,460
the deeper work and kind of going to
those scary places that takes a layer

1089
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:43,420
off of us,
I think.

1090
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:47,260
I mean it's,
it's similar to plant medicine and a lot

1091
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:51,550
of ways of like going to those places
where they're kind of like,

1092
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,170
hmm,
where are you?

1093
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,410
Come out the other side and you have a
deeper understanding of,

1094
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,570
of yourself.
Um,

1095
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,160
so by doing something completely
ridiculous and crazy and just letting

1096
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:04,870
loose and all the madness involved with
it,

1097
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:05,940
it's almost like a reset

1098
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,740
for,
yeah,

1099
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,551
yeah.
Yeah.

1100
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,080
And it's not,
again,

1101
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:10,910
like it's facilitated,
it's not this,

1102
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:12,560
this crazy,
you know,

1103
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,620
people going into fight screaming.
It's not fight club.

1104
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:18,960
It's not because there's a difference
between Catharsis and like actual right

1105
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,470
processing stuff.
But it's just,

1106
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,600
and again,
I think we,

1107
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,200
we don't really understand emotion to a
certain level and we think that big

1108
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:35,300
emotion is crazy and it's not
necessarily,

1109
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:39,020
I think what is crazy,
what makes people crazy is suppressing

1110
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:44,021
it their whole life and trying to manage
it through their mind or through doing

1111
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:49,361
things or through whatever else versus
actually like being willing to look at

1112
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,280
those parts of ourselves because we're,
you know,

1113
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,570
we're humans.
We have a mine,

1114
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,280
we have emotions,
we have actions,

1115
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:56,114
we have,
you know,

1116
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,010
our spiritual self,
whatever you want to call that,

1117
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,170
like something that's connected to
something bigger than us.

1118
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:04,160
And I think we need a holistic approach
to really gage.

1119
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,360
Now,
from the time that you decided to get

1120
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:11,470
off of the antidepressants,
did you follow a protocol?

1121
00:49:11,471 --> 00:49:13,570
Did you go to a doctor to discuss it
with them?

1122
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,600
Did you read anything about how to do
that and what advice would you give to

1123
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:19,600
anybody out there that might be
listening that also is going through

1124
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:20,950
that same sort of situation?

1125
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,050
Um,
doctors told me I couldn't do it,

1126
00:49:24,051 --> 00:49:24,320
so

1127
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,720
I have good doctors ever stay on and I'm
getting paid.

1128
00:49:27,721 --> 00:49:28,554
Exactly.

1129
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,990
Um,
so I had,

1130
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,790
you know,
my coach at the time,

1131
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,830
he was really helpful who was more than,
again,

1132
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:37,900
like coaches such like a,
I don't even know what to call her.

1133
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,640
She was,
how did you find her?

1134
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,810
I was dating a guy who was an addict and
complaining about him to girlfriend at

1135
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:50,030
lunch for like the 80th time.
And she said,

1136
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,430
um,
pill,

1137
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,290
no drugs,
like coke,

1138
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,620
alcohol,
maybe pills and the pills to fun times.

1139
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,260
Good Times.
Hollywood.

1140
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,510
Yeah.
Was Super Great.

1141
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,550
Yeah.
I was popping xanax while he was doing

1142
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:06,970
all that.
So anyway,

1143
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,900
I,
um,

1144
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,820
and I've totally lost my train of
thought.

1145
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,290
Oh,
how'd you find your coach?

1146
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,711
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1147
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:14,050
I had a find a coach.
So we're sitting at lunch,

1148
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:15,910
I'm talking about this for like the 80th
time.

1149
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,230
And she goes,
I can't,

1150
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,440
I can't listen to this anymore.
I went and saw this kind of Kooky woman,

1151
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:21,843
go see her.

1152
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,190
So,
and I had been like to shrinks my whole

1153
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,980
life and I had never been to like a
coach.

1154
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,890
I had always been to therapists and
psychiatrists and so nothing against

1155
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:32,870
therapists and psychiatrists,
they do good work.

1156
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,810
Um,
but I had kind of like reached my limit

1157
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:38,450
with it.
And so I go to this woman's house and

1158
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:40,880
she's like,
it's totally stuck in 1985,

1159
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,470
like her decor,
her fashion,

1160
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:46,250
everything.
And I sit down and I sit across from her

1161
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,830
and she didn't even see me in a normal
office.

1162
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:51,410
I think she knew she needed to be like
totally get me out of my comfort zone.

1163
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:54,500
So she put me in her son's bedroom with
like these race car,

1164
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:56,480
bunk beds and I'm sitting there on this
race car,

1165
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:57,320
bunk bed,
the going,

1166
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,360
where am I?
How did I get here?

1167
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,360
And she walks in,
she sits in front of me and it was the

1168
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:05,150
first time in my life and I felt loved
by my parents,

1169
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:09,020
but this was the first time in my life I
felt really seen.

1170
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,770
Like it was almost uncomfortable.
Like this woman could almost see through

1171
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:14,150
me.
She could see me,

1172
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:17,180
she could really see me and I felt zero
judgment from her,

1173
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:22,210
like zero.
And although it was scary and a little

1174
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:25,190
bit because it was like kind of,
I felt very vulnerable.

1175
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,890
It,
there was something so reassuring about

1176
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:32,270
it because she was the first like
practitioner I had seen that didn't see

1177
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:36,920
me as broken.
She really just saw me and she was the

1178
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:41,330
one that in so many ways helped me over
the years get off the medication by

1179
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:44,000
teaching me how to release my emotions.
Um,

1180
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,730
by helping me understand that,
you know,

1181
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,470
bad feelings aren't necessarily bad.
I also got very clear about my diet.

1182
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:55,460
Like I got off gluten because a lot of
times gluten can impact brain chemistry.

1183
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,500
Um,
I stopped drinking and it wasn't ever a

1184
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:59,360
big drinker,
but I stopped drinking for about two

1185
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:01,400
years because alcohol's a depressant.

1186
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,170
I'd always been into exercise and
fitness and eating healthy and

1187
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,130
everything like that.
Um,

1188
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,160
and then I also started meditating and
like finding some kind of connection to

1189
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:14,990
a higher power.
I didn't really have a name for it at

1190
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:17,390
the time,
but something where I didn't feel like I

1191
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:19,940
was so alone because that was kind of
one of the scary things about

1192
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,280
depression.
You feel you feel alone a lot at the

1193
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:25,190
time.
And so it was a combination of all of

1194
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:28,500
those things that over time and the
belief that I could,

1195
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:31,790
and I really had to change my belief
that I could get off of them.

1196
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,090
Um,
so for people that are considering it,

1197
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,680
um,
don't just stop.

1198
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,170
Like,
it's dangerous just to stop because that

1199
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:41,480
can really mess with your brain
chemistry.

1200
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Find somebody who knows something about
this and can put you on a plan,

1201
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,730
can help you.
You know,

1202
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:51,020
I'm,
I'm not a doctor.

1203
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:53,270
I'm not here to get met,
get give medical advice.

1204
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:54,210
So,
you know,

1205
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,270
consulted doctor.
Um,

1206
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,300
but for me it was number one,
the belief that I could and number two,

1207
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:04,250
finding the people that could really
support me.

1208
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:07,760
And number three,
making the lifestyle changes that I

1209
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:12,110
needed to make to support it and being
willing to go to that dark,

1210
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:15,530
scary place that I was afraid to go to.

1211
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,920
What do you mean by when you say that
she was the first person that didn't see

1212
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:21,210
you as broken?
Well,

1213
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,770
how do you,
what do you mean by they all,

1214
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:26,730
they all saw you as broken?
Well,

1215
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:27,740
I think

1216
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,880
when,
you know,

1217
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:32,150
for me,
when I would go to one of these doctors

1218
00:53:32,151 --> 00:53:34,880
or therapists,
I mean they'd see that I was on

1219
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:39,881
medication since I was 10 and um,
they kind of relate to me in that way

1220
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,330
as a depressed person.
No,

1221
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:45,810
just more like,
like I had a label like this is it,

1222
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,430
you're depressed.
And so that's why they weren't willing

1223
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:50,440
to consider,
are you getting off of the medication?

1224
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,870
I felt like the is a part of who you
are.

1225
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,510
You got to accept it.
It's a daily thing.

1226
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,190
It's like brushing your teeth,
you're not going to stop.

1227
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:57,851
Yeah,
maybe.

1228
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:59,050
I mean,
I don't even know what they were

1229
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:03,010
thinking was just know how it felt and I
just did it.

1230
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,940
Maybe it was because like at the time I
didn't believe it yet either.

1231
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,220
Maybe I need to someone who believed in

1232
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,560
more than,
I do think that also the people that

1233
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:12,410
deal with people every day,
whether you're a psychologist or a

1234
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:16,820
psychiatrist or whatever,
that you're so inundated with people and

1235
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:20,180
their fucking problems that after a
while you just become overwhelmed and

1236
00:54:20,181 --> 00:54:24,560
it's very difficult to see people like
can have a fresh reset every time you

1237
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,790
see something like this is a new person.
Her name's Christine.

1238
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,450
Hey Christine,
what's going on with you?

1239
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,660
Yeah,
I think you're right.

1240
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:31,670
I think it's therapists,
psychiatrists,

1241
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:35,030
they have hard jobs.
Like imagine your whole day is person

1242
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:38,360
after person talking about what's wrong
with their life.

1243
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:40,950
You know that that can be very draining.
You know,

1244
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,910
even when I first started as a life
coach and I saw person after person

1245
00:54:43,911 --> 00:54:46,610
after person,
I really had to learn not to take that

1246
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:49,430
on.
And not to let it drain me.

1247
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,440
Um,
so again,

1248
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:54,830
like I have a lot of respect for their,
at my mom's a therapist,

1249
00:54:54,831 --> 00:54:57,710
so I have a lot of respect for
therapists and psychiatrists are very

1250
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:02,711
helpful to me.
I just think for me in my life journey

1251
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:05,330
and what I wanted,
I,

1252
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,120
I just,
I didn't want to spend the rest of my

1253
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:10,690
life medicated.
I just really did it.

1254
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:11,120
Yeah.

1255
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,470
So what is the difference between life
on medication and life off medication

1256
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,630
and how long has the process of weaning
yourself?

1257
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,340
I mean,
I think it took me,

1258
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:26,780
it took me a good two years to feel like
it was finally kind of out of my system.

1259
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,430
Two years.
How long was it before you were actually

1260
00:55:30,431 --> 00:55:31,470
stopping taking it?

1261
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,910
Um,
well I,

1262
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,770
I,
Gosh,

1263
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,950
I can't remember exactly,
but I think I,

1264
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,280
I probably weaned for a good six months
and then it was like a year and a half

1265
00:55:40,281 --> 00:55:42,450
till I felt like it was like cleared out
of my system.

1266
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,110
Wow.
So for six months you slowly wean

1267
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:49,080
yourself off of it and then at the end
of six months you're not taking the

1268
00:55:49,081 --> 00:55:51,540
medication anymore,
but you still feel foggy.

1269
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,470
Like what do you feel?
Okay.

1270
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,011
Yeah,
I was,

1271
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:55,260
it was,
it was like my system was recalibrating,

1272
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,870
you know,
all my brain chemistry was recalibrating

1273
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,700
and you know,
cause that stuff affects your brain

1274
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:01,260
chemistry.
It affected my hormones.

1275
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:02,130
Like it,
it just,

1276
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:04,090
you know,
it effected a lot.

1277
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:04,290
Yeah.

1278
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,860
So did you take like one pill and then
cut it down to three quarters of a pill

1279
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:09,694
and then

1280
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:15,050
I did consult a psychiatrist and um,
they gave me like a winning plan.

1281
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,730
So yeah,
whatever at different people,

1282
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:21,120
like it's not a standard thing,
like different psychiatrists will tell

1283
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:23,680
you different things.
So it depends on what dosage you're on,

1284
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,930
how long you've been on it,
which medication you're on,

1285
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,750
what the side effects for for it are,
those kinds of things.

1286
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,280
What does it feel like when you're first
day no pills?

1287
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,140
Do you remember that day?
I remember the first day I woke up and I

1288
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:40,570
felt clear,
like I felt like

1289
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,560
I don't want to get kicked out of here.

1290
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:47,830
No.
Um,

1291
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,970
like,
like,

1292
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,150
like it was like out of me and I was
like,

1293
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,130
oh my gosh.
Like I just felt like a fog and a

1294
00:56:55,131 --> 00:56:57,560
heaviness had lifted.
It just fell.

1295
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:02,610
And I also felt like
I had deeper access to my creativity,

1296
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,600
my intuition and all those things were
present,

1297
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,300
but it was just,
there was just sort of like some white

1298
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:14,170
noise there.
And I also like for me,

1299
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:17,170
depression manifested as being
incredibly self critical,

1300
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,620
like super self critical,
like this very,

1301
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:22,210
very,
very loud inner critic.

1302
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,880
And so that started to lift too.
But again,

1303
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:26,980
I was doing all kinds of other work at
the same time.

1304
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,200
You know,
I was studying with my life coach,

1305
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:31,930
I was getting a master's degree in
spiritual psychology.

1306
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:34,210
I was a spiritual psychology.
Yes,

1307
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,380
good question.
So,

1308
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:38,380
um,
it's a place called the University of

1309
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,390
Santa Monica and I didn't know anything
about this place,

1310
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:43,510
but I had been a life coach and I
thought,

1311
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,400
okay,
if I'm helping people with their life,

1312
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:47,680
I've got to know how to help them deal
with their past.

1313
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,910
Like I can't just work on present and
future without like having some skills

1314
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,750
for dealing with your past.
And so I was researching schools.

1315
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:58,600
I thought if I could get a master's
degree in psychology that would help me

1316
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,090
and that would be good for my career and
all those things to have like some

1317
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:04,030
credentials.
So I researched and I find this school

1318
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:05,530
and I didn't really know anything about
it and I'm like,

1319
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:07,630
this is great.
And the spiritual part didn't have

1320
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:10,240
anything to do with any religion or
anything like that.

1321
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:14,770
It was more of the premise of you know,
that that traditional psychology is,

1322
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:19,810
is kind of a little bit more about like
labels and spiritual psychology is more

1323
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,810
people have the inner resources they
need to to heal.

1324
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,750
And I didn't,
again didn't know much about it.

1325
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,960
Show up at this school with my laptop
thinking I'm going to like take notes

1326
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:32,110
and there's going to be lectures but it,
there are no desks.

1327
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:37,110
It was a highly experiential school.
It's like I said a two year program and

1328
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,240
in that I really learned how to um,
change my belief systems.

1329
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,890
He'll stuff from my past connect to a
part of me cause we all have like our

1330
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,930
basic self,
like our conscious part.

1331
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,190
But I believe we also have something
deeper like art,

1332
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,860
we can call it our intuition,
we can call it our gut feeling,

1333
00:58:56,861 --> 00:59:00,430
we can call it our authentic self,
but there's some kind of inner wisdom

1334
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,620
that I think all of us have access to.
And this program really helped me get

1335
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:08,740
more access to that,
that part of me so that I could start

1336
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:12,330
listening to that more than my old
conditioning.

1337
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,880
My old belief system is my old fears
because you know,

1338
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:20,860
when we're born we're kind of this blank
slate and then stuff happens.

1339
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:24,710
And we formed these stories about our
lives and who we are and how we get love

1340
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:28,580
and how we get validation and how we get
acceptance and how life works and who we

1341
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:29,570
are and our identity.

1342
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,930
And it's kind of a just a story.
And we have,

1343
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,890
we can change that story,
but it takes work going back and

1344
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:41,420
deconstructing that story and letting go
of some old beliefs that maybe we've

1345
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:43,250
hung on to,
to create a different one.

1346
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:47,000
So that's,
that's what so much of my journey has

1347
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:52,001
been about is kind of looking at what's
the story I've created about my life and

1348
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,420
how can I change it?
Because the story that I had was I'm

1349
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:57,980
depressed,
I'm,

1350
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,900
you know,
have to be achieving all the time,

1351
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,000
being hard on myself as how I motivate
myself.

1352
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:04,010
So on and so forth.
I'm constantly rejected,

1353
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:04,431
blah,
blah,

1354
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:04,791
blah,
blah,

1355
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:06,260
blah.
And by believing that story,

1356
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:07,940
it was creating results in my life that
align,

1357
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,090
that aligned with that.
And so to create different results,

1358
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:12,920
I had to have a different story to tell.

1359
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,080
And so there's this shift that that has
to take place.

1360
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,480
And it's,
it's like turning a battleship,

1361
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,500
right?
It's not,

1362
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,800
it's not a quick thing.
It takes a long time.

1363
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:23,990
No,
it's,

1364
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,950
it's not.
And I think that's another,

1365
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,550
um,
kind of let downs people have when they

1366
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,720
go to a seminar or read one book,
they expect to change overnight.

1367
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,820
And it's a,
it's a process.

1368
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,900
Do you remember the secret?
I do.

1369
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,120
There was a girl,
I've told this story before,

1370
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:42,790
but she was so nice.
She's friends with my friend Kelly,

1371
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,080
Kelly Carson,
you know,

1372
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:46,660
Kelly corrosion comedian.
Funny girl.

1373
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,100
Anyway,
uh,

1374
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,530
she was at the comedy store one night
and,

1375
01:00:50,531 --> 01:00:51,820
uh,
she was,

1376
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,010
she was talking to Kelly and,
uh,

1377
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,000
I was talking to her and she started
going on about her future,

1378
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:02,350
all the things that she was going to do.
She was going to be married within a

1379
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,030
year.
She was going to have the career that

1380
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:06,640
she wants.
She was going to this and that and that

1381
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:08,560
and this.
And,

1382
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:11,770
uh,
I was so confused and she was like,

1383
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,990
um,
I found the secret I'm doing,

1384
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,550
you know,
do you know about the secret?

1385
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,140
I go,
oh,

1386
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:19,090
uh,
the power of positive thinking,

1387
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,290
I that kind of thing.
She's like,

1388
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,280
it's,
it's not just that,

1389
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,720
it's not just positive thinking.

1390
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,780
It's like you do create your own future.
You create your own identity.

1391
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:28,190
You create,
you know,

1392
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,410
you,
you create reality.

1393
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:30,244
I was like,
okay,

1394
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,200
like you sure?
And she's like,

1395
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:33,670
yeah,
I'm sure you know I'm,

1396
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:34,930
I'm positive.
Okay,

1397
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,320
good luck.
I'm like,

1398
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,380
boy,
the problem with all that stuff,

1399
01:01:38,381 --> 01:01:39,970
of course,
if you've never heard of it,

1400
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:41,580
is what do they,
what?

1401
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:42,414
What is the,
the,

1402
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,670
the term for it.
They're trying to achieve law of

1403
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:46,504
attraction.
Yeah.

1404
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,190
What,
what they're trying to achieve is

1405
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:52,000
they're trying to like,
you take the a photo of your dream

1406
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:53,560
house,
you pin it on your wall,

1407
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:55,870
you take a photo of a Ferrari,
you pin that on the wall.

1408
01:01:55,990 --> 01:02:00,130
You're going to get those things.
The problem is when you watch those

1409
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:01,690
videos,
when they say,

1410
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:05,470
you know,
I had this photo of my home on the mall.

1411
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:08,050
I had the Ferrari that I wanted.

1412
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,230
I had my dream life.
Now I have those things.

1413
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,070
I made those things happen with
intention and with thought.

1414
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:19,560
Do you know how many fucking people have
a photo of a beautiful house on their

1415
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:22,410
wall and a Ferrari?
And they got no fucking house and they

1416
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,080
got no Ferrari and they never will like
you.

1417
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:29,580
It's,
you're taking it from a biased pool of

1418
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:33,360
successful people who will tell you that
this happened to them.

1419
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:37,680
But there are literally millions of
people who think positive and nothing

1420
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:40,980
ever happens to them.
So this girl who,

1421
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:43,320
um,
was a very nice person,

1422
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:46,590
uh,
she came to one of my shows like a year

1423
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,890
later and a were hanging out outside and
I go,

1424
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,840
how's everything when you're doing?
She's like,

1425
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:54,090
well,
it's really a drag,

1426
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:56,880
you know,
because I was convinced that by this

1427
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:58,650
time I would have all these things.

1428
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,640
Yeah.
But you know,

1429
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:01,350
my dad,
he's still,

1430
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,110
you know,
fuck up and this and that and I've got

1431
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:06,660
this problem,
that problem and I just don't understand

1432
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:07,770
it.
I don't understand it.

1433
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,560
I believe that I was so sure.
And we had this like,

1434
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,540
really,
it was really interesting because she

1435
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,790
was like two different people.
Like I'd met her twice.

1436
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,950
Right.
So I meet her this one time and she's

1437
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:21,951
just a glow with this delusion that now
she's got it and she's getting,

1438
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,310
she was,
she was,

1439
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:27,780
she thought also that talking about it
all the time was part of how you affirm

1440
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:28,890
it.
So she was saying,

1441
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,870
you know,
I'm going to be married in a year.

1442
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,120
I'm going to do this.
I'm following the secrets.

1443
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:36,930
She kept saying it and it was whoa.
And then a year later she was just,

1444
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,430
I don't get it.
It didn't work.

1445
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,560
And so we had this sort of heart to
heart about it.

1446
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,780
Haven't talked to her again.
And I don't know what the hell happened

1447
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,990
to her,
but I'll never forget it because the two

1448
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:46,960
different people,
the,

1449
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,200
the,
the girl who was like,

1450
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,980
it was like kind of crazy,
like all why I didn't believe in.

1451
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:57,270
And then a year later,
year and a half I think just wasn't

1452
01:03:57,271 --> 01:04:00,240
happening and life was still kind of
shitty.

1453
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:03,210
And she was,
she couldn't understand why the career

1454
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:08,211
didn't happen and alive didn't happen.
And it's is all,

1455
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,260
it's a slow shift.

1456
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:15,540
It's a slow shift and I think the law of
attraction can be misleading because

1457
01:04:15,701 --> 01:04:16,900
it's more,
you know,

1458
01:04:16,901 --> 01:04:21,901
change takes more than I put a picture
up and I do some positive affirmations.

1459
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:26,260
If like down deep,
you don't feel like you're worthy,

1460
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,720
um,
or you're,

1461
01:04:28,721 --> 01:04:31,180
you're not going to be able to attract
those things.

1462
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:35,190
You've got to like kind of go back and
deal with core issues and core beliefs,

1463
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:37,660
systems in order to shift things in your
life.

1464
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,850
I mean,
if it was as easy as putting pictures up

1465
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:41,740
on our wall,
everybody would have,

1466
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:43,870
you know,
Lamborghini's and hot and wives and

1467
01:04:43,871 --> 01:04:44,740
husbands.
So,

1468
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:46,780
but it takes,
it takes more than that.

1469
01:04:46,781 --> 01:04:51,550
It takes being willing to like do some
work and take some responsibility rather

1470
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:55,570
than just thinking the universe is Santa
Claus and just was going to pop

1471
01:04:55,571 --> 01:04:56,860
something into your life.
I acquainted

1472
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,220
to people that are morbidly obese that
want a six pack.

1473
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,950
Like it can be done,
can be done,

1474
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,050
but God damn.
Yup.

1475
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,530
You got a long road.
Yup.

1476
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,470
You know,
if you want to climb Mount Everest and

1477
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:12,010
you're starting in Santa Monica,
you gotta fucking get to Mount Everest.

1478
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:12,650
Absolutely

1479
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:13,820
right.
Absolutely.

1480
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:16,280
And then that's when people ask me how
you get off antidepressants?

1481
01:05:16,281 --> 01:05:17,590
I'm not like,
oh,

1482
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:19,720
I just did this and then I did this and
then I did this.

1483
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:22,600
It was,
it was years of like,

1484
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,960
you know,
deciding I was going to and having the

1485
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:27,370
right people around.
It wasn't,

1486
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,650
it wasn't an easy thing.
It's probably the hardest thing I've

1487
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:30,484
done.
No.

1488
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:33,790
Now what is the difference between
antidepressants and like Xanax?

1489
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,250
Like when you're taking,
you said you were taking both.

1490
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,290
Yeah.
Why do you need the Xanax if you're

1491
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,030
already pilled up on the
antidepressants?

1492
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,030
I mean,
again,

1493
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:43,490
not an MD,
so not my territory,

1494
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:47,600
but for me like I,
the antidepressants just kind of kept me

1495
01:05:47,601 --> 01:05:52,280
steady.
But then with my boyfriend at the time

1496
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:56,510
and my crazy Hollywood life,
like I just had so much anxiety and you

1497
01:05:56,511 --> 01:05:58,370
know,
you go to a doctor and you're like,

1498
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,390
I have so much anxiety though.
Like,

1499
01:05:59,391 --> 01:06:01,580
do you want to say or how do you define
anxiety?

1500
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:05,990
I'm like worried or not worried a lot
like kind of high,

1501
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:09,020
strong.
I'm not able to calm down.

1502
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:10,640
Um,
yeah,

1503
01:06:10,641 --> 01:06:15,641
just that just normal like anxiety,
but I didn't have tools then my tools,

1504
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:21,080
then we're medicine.
Mm now had better tools.

1505
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:25,340
So now do,
do you take anything?

1506
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:25,730
Nope.

1507
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,330
And then supplements,
supplements,

1508
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,790
vitamins and stuff.
Vitamins.

1509
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:33,220
Yeah.
I'm super like I love human hacking and

1510
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:34,440
human optimization.
I'm,

1511
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,800
I love exercising.
I love meditation.

1512
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:39,690
Meditation.
I take Alpha brain,

1513
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:40,890
like all that stuff.
Okay.

1514
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,220
And you,
do you ever miss it?

1515
01:06:43,221 --> 01:06:44,240
Like is there ever a time when we're
like,

1516
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:46,950
God damage my pop,
Xanax and fucking drinking glasses?

1517
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,750
No,
no.

1518
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,100
I will say this though.
One,

1519
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:51,810
I had my eyes Lasik,
Lasik,

1520
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:56,110
the Lasik and they gave me valium and I
was like,

1521
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:59,970
oh this,
I see why people get addicted to this.

1522
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,150
This is incredible.
But I'm glad they did because I was

1523
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:07,710
super freaked out about them cutting my
eyeball open and valium just relaxes you

1524
01:07:07,711 --> 01:07:09,480
rise.
I wouldn't done it felt great.

1525
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:11,310
And then the only time I ever did it,
but no,

1526
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:15,330
I don't miss that because what I have
now is,

1527
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:20,420
um,
like I feel clear and alive and you

1528
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:23,370
don't feel happy all the time.
I definitely have my days,

1529
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:27,010
but I don't relate to it as I'm
depressed right now.

1530
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,871
It's just like,
oh,

1531
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,280
I'm having a normal,
like,

1532
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,960
you know,
human experience and not having the

1533
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:31,290
best.

1534
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,230
I think stories like this is a very
inspiring to people and I think it's

1535
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:36,540
very important in it.
We don't want,

1536
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:37,440
it's,
it's like,

1537
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,130
it's hard for people to look at people
who aren't doing well and talk to them

1538
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:42,720
and just go,
oh,

1539
01:07:42,721 --> 01:07:44,140
I don't know what to tell Ya.
And,

1540
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:44,931
uh,
good luck.

1541
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:46,080
Let me get the fuck away from this
bitch.

1542
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,580
You know,
like that's how people think.

1543
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:51,390
Like I don't want to deal with her
problems are his problems are I wanna I

1544
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:54,270
wanna I want to separate my and
concentrate on myself.

1545
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:59,550
So I think when someone like you can
sort of express how you were in this

1546
01:07:59,551 --> 01:08:04,320
really bad state and yours is a very
bizarre situation because you're talking

1547
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:07,500
about being on these pills from the time
you're 10 right.

1548
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,990
That's,
that's really unique.

1549
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,850
But then having almost a decade off of
them,

1550
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:12,930
seven years off of them.

1551
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,211
Yeah.
Yeah.

1552
01:08:14,211 --> 01:08:15,380
I'm a state.
Yeah.

1553
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:17,300
And it's,
I,

1554
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,770
I honestly think
it helps me help people.

1555
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,280
Like it really does.
I've had lots of training as a life

1556
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:27,740
coach,
but my own life experiences have been

1557
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,190
the thing that's really given me the
most critics,

1558
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,100
I guess you could say.
Well,

1559
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,970
you credentials or that you're actually
happy.

1560
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:36,700
Yeah,
I'm actually happy.

1561
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:37,810
I,
you know,

1562
01:08:37,811 --> 01:08:41,020
I hate,
I've been able to create a life and a

1563
01:08:41,021 --> 01:08:43,240
career in friendships and connection
that,

1564
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,000
you know,
I thought I no longer live that story of

1565
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:46,870
that.
I Hate Christine Club.

1566
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:48,400
I have great friends,
great women friends,

1567
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:49,690
like all of that,
you know,

1568
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:50,650
and,
and that's,

1569
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,920
I,
I'm no like different or more special

1570
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,360
than anybody.
It's just again,

1571
01:08:55,390 --> 01:09:00,390
choices and I made choices that led me
to this point.

1572
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:04,030
And everybody has that.
Everybody has that freedom.

1573
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:06,400
What's the book man's search for
meaning?

1574
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:09,280
Have you ever read that book by Viktor
Frankl?

1575
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,450
He was,
yeah.

1576
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:11,380
He was,
um,

1577
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,140
in concentration camps and he was
actually a psychiatrist,

1578
01:09:14,141 --> 01:09:16,270
I think.
But he talked about,

1579
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,310
you know,
he kept himself saying,

1580
01:09:18,311 --> 01:09:20,350
and he kept himself free through his
mind.

1581
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:23,500
And he says in between stimulus and
response,

1582
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:26,980
basically what happens and how we
respond is a choice.

1583
01:09:26,981 --> 01:09:29,020
And in that choice lies our ultimate
freedom.

1584
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,410
And I think that that's true.
That's,

1585
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:33,550
that's what we all have.
That freedom,

1586
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,500
no matter what your circumstances.

1587
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,280
No.
When someone comes to you and they're

1588
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:37,801
like,
Christine,

1589
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:40,040
I'm all fucked up.
I need to get my shit together.

1590
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,730
Like,
how do you,

1591
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:46,220
uh,
how do you start with somebody?

1592
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,170
But it's different.
You know,

1593
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,670
everybody's different.
But is there anything that people are

1594
01:09:50,671 --> 01:09:53,350
universally could benefit from?
Is there,

1595
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,020
yeah.
Yeah.

1596
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,690
The,
the number one thing that,

1597
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,910
where I start with people is having them
really look at their relationship with

1598
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:05,160
themselves.
Because when they come,

1599
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:05,671
they're like,
oh,

1600
01:10:05,671 --> 01:10:07,020
I'm fucked up.
Or I need help.

1601
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,540
They're relating to themselves as if
something's,

1602
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,010
you know,
something's wrong with them and they're

1603
01:10:11,011 --> 01:10:14,160
being really hard on themselves and
they've kind of lost hope and lost

1604
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:18,300
belief in themselves.
So the first thing is just like

1605
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:20,010
acceptance,
accepting where you are.

1606
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,380
Because you know,
I had,

1607
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:24,300
I haven't liked everything that's
happened to me,

1608
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:27,780
but one of the main raise I've been able
to move through it is because I stopped

1609
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:29,700
fighting.
It isn't that like in martial arts,

1610
01:10:29,701 --> 01:10:31,830
if a punch comes at you,
you're not supposed to resist it.

1611
01:10:31,831 --> 01:10:33,510
You're supposed to kind of move with it.

1612
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,490
Yeah.
Move away from it or roll with it,

1613
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,353
roll with it.
Right.

1614
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,870
Like your teeth are your teeth and take
it on a job.

1615
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,710
Exactly.

1616
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,240
And in life we kind of do that.
We're like,

1617
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,170
oh,
I don't want this break up.

1618
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:44,550
I don't want this layoff.
We resist it,

1619
01:10:44,551 --> 01:10:46,260
we fight it.
And so it's like,

1620
01:10:46,261 --> 01:10:48,430
can we just get to acceptance of like,
okay,

1621
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,480
where are you are who you are and what's
happening right now?

1622
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:53,880
Perspective and perspective.
Yeah.

1623
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,670
And when you can get to that neutral
place,

1624
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,440
that's when you can start doing the
work.

1625
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:00,720
And that's when you can start doing
different things.

1626
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:03,000
And then the second thing is I ask
people like,

1627
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:06,240
do you believe you can shift?
Do you believe that you have like the

1628
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:08,370
power to make different choices and
change?

1629
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,820
And you don't have to know how that's,
that's my job.

1630
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:14,850
I'll help you with the how,
but you've got to believe you can

1631
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,160
because if we don't believe it's
possible for us and it's really hard to

1632
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:21,390
make any kind of change in our life.

1633
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,310
Hmm,
yeah,

1634
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:25,470
that is,
that is giant.

1635
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:29,370
But how does someone believe,
like how do you get someone to believe

1636
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:32,730
that they can make change?
Like do they have to see evidence in

1637
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:34,100
themselves?
Do you,

1638
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:38,670
is there like,
do you recommend like attempting things

1639
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:42,300
or tasks or hobbies or,
right.

1640
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:47,170
Well a lot of times it's going back to a
time in your life where you did take a

1641
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:50,350
chance or you did do something that was
a stretch in some way.

1642
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,950
Like everybody has times in their life
where they've done something they

1643
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:58,630
weren't completely sure they could do.
Even if it's just a little thing and

1644
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:01,600
everybody has that reference point they
can go back to.

1645
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:05,710
But a lot of this joe,
like honestly a lot of it is taking a

1646
01:12:05,711 --> 01:12:10,450
leap of faith and I,
I've taken a lot of those and I've

1647
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:15,340
wanted to know the answer and I've
wanted to know like 100% that this would

1648
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:17,680
be guaranteed.
Like if I take this leap of faith,

1649
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:18,930
everything will work out.
And I,

1650
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,430
they haven't always been 100%
guarantees,

1651
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:25,300
but it was in taking that leap and
taking that chance and having a little

1652
01:12:25,301 --> 01:12:30,130
faith that things started showing up and
things started shifting and that's what

1653
01:12:30,131 --> 01:12:33,880
started to create the evidence.
And it's a tricky thing cause I think

1654
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:36,430
people want evidence before they make
change.

1655
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,310
But you have to start making these
little changes,

1656
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:42,280
beef to start having the evidence show
up.

1657
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,010
I don't know if I answered your
question.

1658
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,310
No,
that doesn't make sense.

1659
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,350
Um,
I,

1660
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,780
I've often said that very difficult
tasks.

1661
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,510
Like a anything that's difficult that
you do?

1662
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:55,090
Yeah.
It gives you the confidence that you can

1663
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:57,010
overcome adversity and you can,
you can,

1664
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:02,140
whether it's I'm a martial art thing or
something along those lines or marathon

1665
01:13:02,141 --> 01:13:04,570
running or anything.
When you do something like that,

1666
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:08,620
these incremental changes happen where
you push yourself through things,

1667
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:12,220
especially if you can achieve a goal.
If you could set out to do something,

1668
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,040
you achieve that goal.
Like I'm going to run a marathon by the

1669
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,600
end of this year.
I don't know why I keep saying marathon,

1670
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:17,860
but you know what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1671
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,690
It doing things along those lines,
they can be motivating.

1672
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:24,400
Factors are,
they can help push you.

1673
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,850
They can be the engine that starts to
push things in a positive direction

1674
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,020
and you start to believe in yourself and
you start to believe,

1675
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:32,420
oh wow,
like I can do this.

1676
01:13:32,421 --> 01:13:34,700
I can take this step.
You know?

1677
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:37,520
I often tell people that show up or come
to a workshop.

1678
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,190
I'm like,
just that fact that you're here is proof

1679
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:43,910
that you believe you can change because
like you wouldn't have shown up if some

1680
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:46,520
part of you was an,
you know,

1681
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:48,350
kind of certain that you could,

1682
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,870
have you ever had someone come to you?
You're like,

1683
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,120
I can't even help this dude.
The girl.

1684
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,503
No,
not yet.

1685
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,270
No.
Do you get mostly dudes or girls?

1686
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,700
Well,
I only coach a few people now.

1687
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:00,160
Um,
my retreats are mostly women.

1688
01:14:00,161 --> 01:14:04,030
My private clients both.
And then my courses and stuff.

1689
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,080
How can we have retreats that are all
women?

1690
01:14:06,081 --> 01:14:06,914
Not,

1691
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:08,090
well,
I know,

1692
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:08,720
I know.
I'm going to get,

1693
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,100
I'm going to do on that.
Um,

1694
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,140
will be both men and women soon and was
like a recipe for danger,

1695
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:16,150
too.
Depressed people hopping in the woods or

1696
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,260
wherever we're going first.
The one that everybody's depressed.

1697
01:14:18,261 --> 01:14:23,261
Some people come just to grow and like
the range means they're out in the

1698
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:30,520
woods.
That's amazing.

1699
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,350
No,
I like to do it in places like Bali and

1700
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:37,351
Costa Rica.
This might be able to,

1701
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:45,300
some people.
So I,

1702
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:48,140
whenever I go to anywhere tropical,
I get eaten alive.

1703
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:50,980
Alive.
No matter what other people have three

1704
01:14:50,981 --> 01:14:52,270
bites,
I'll have 400.

1705
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,180
I finally figured out B one,
vitamin B,

1706
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:56,014
one,
two.

1707
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,570
It's totally stopped it.
You have to find it.

1708
01:14:58,571 --> 01:15:03,010
Like you can't take a b complex.
It's vitamin B one.

1709
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:06,010
Huh?
And it's for some reason stops in

1710
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:10,900
mosquitoes and bug bites.
I have no idea.

1711
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:14,470
I just know worked for me.
It does something to change your smell.

1712
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,970
I don't know.
It just worked.

1713
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,040
It was my salvation.
I was so happy.

1714
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:21,520
They don't bite you at all a little bit.
But again,

1715
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:23,980
it went from being eaten alive to just
getting a few.

1716
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,580
Did you ever try thermacell?
No.

1717
01:15:26,581 --> 01:15:30,540
What's that term?
A cell is a device that a lot of people

1718
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:32,670
take when they go camping.
Things along those lines.

1719
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,563
You,
um,

1720
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:35,400
it's like,
uh,

1721
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,480
it looks like almost like a radio and it
has these little pads and you slide

1722
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:44,481
these pads into this heating element and
this very fine mist comes out of this

1723
01:15:45,121 --> 01:15:47,040
heating element.
You could put it on the ground near you

1724
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,370
and the bugs won't come with an 18 foot
circle.

1725
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,200
Yeah,
yeah.

1726
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:54,540
Use it when you're hunting.
And you're in the woods because if

1727
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:55,920
you're,
if you're in the woods,

1728
01:15:55,921 --> 01:15:59,640
like,
especially in Alaska or Alberta,

1729
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:01,530
I don't know if you ever been to Alaska
in the summer,

1730
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:07,250
the mosquitoes are insane because they
own their only alive for a month.

1731
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,450
Oh,
so today's good at town like rabbit,

1732
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:13,480
barbarian,
mosquitoes like me and my friend Ari

1733
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:17,830
went fishing in Alaska and it was so
crazy that you would get out of the car.

1734
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:19,000
We pulled up to this,
uh,

1735
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:20,740
the stream.
You get out of the car,

1736
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:25,390
you open the door and then won't,
you're hit with a cloud of mosquitoes.

1737
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:29,230
We jumped back in the car and shut the
door and we were in the car with like 50

1738
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:30,100
mosquitoes.
We were like,

1739
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:33,710
what in the fuck is going on?
So then we're spraying ourselves well as

1740
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:38,380
spray all these toxic chemicals that
found out about thermo cells,

1741
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:41,350
dermal cells just,
it cleans it out totally.

1742
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,030
There's an easy to travel with them.
Yeah,

1743
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:44,380
they don't even,
they're really light.

1744
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,990
It doesn't even smell.
I mean you barely smells,

1745
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,480
but bugs don't want to have anything to
do with it.

1746
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,750
Mosquitoes don't want to have anything
to do with it without thermacell was

1747
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:55,150
like hanging out in the woods,
like sitting in a spot.

1748
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:59,110
It's almost unbearable unless you have
mosquito netting and you don't want to

1749
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:02,250
wear like all that mosquito bug spray
stuff and your,

1750
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:05,110
your skin is an Oregon,
you know all that stuff that you're

1751
01:17:05,111 --> 01:17:07,570
putting on your skin.
It is just not good.

1752
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,050
I was using my first couple

1753
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:12,470
of days on my last trip and I started
getting sick and I'm like,

1754
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:13,580
I can't.
This is like,

1755
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:15,530
what am I doing?
And you're processing it with your

1756
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,150
liver,
terrible skin.

1757
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:19,000
It gets in your bloodstream.
Terrible.

1758
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,540
Yeah.
I mean I'm sure there's probably some

1759
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:24,220
nontoxic alternatives,
but they probably don't work then so be

1760
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:26,120
it worked for me.
Hey,

1761
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:29,570
b one you hear it folks five.
I've heard that before.

1762
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:31,970
A friend of mine was telling me that
about Africa.

1763
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:35,690
They went to Africa and they took a
bunch of b vitamins that did it,

1764
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:38,280
but b,
one in particular did it for me.

1765
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,890
Find anything on that.
Jamie,

1766
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,940
I found something that said that studies
are inconclusive but it may make

1767
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,081
mosquitoes.
Thank you.

1768
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:46,430
Stink.
Good.

1769
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,650
Perfect.
Good.

1770
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,920
It's fine for me.
Dig it up.

1771
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,400
I wonder if it's like a vitamin that
makes people think you smelt good.

1772
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,060
People are mosquitoes.
People don't.

1773
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,490
Yeah,
because if bananas don't eat bananas for

1774
01:17:58,491 --> 01:17:59,900
mosquito season,
don't eat bananas.

1775
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:02,420
That makes sense it.
But I would think that like,

1776
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:06,770
well it does probably like weird smells
that you're not even sure you did

1777
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:09,070
attacked you.
Now some people just give off a weird

1778
01:18:09,071 --> 01:18:10,320
odor to people.
Yes.

1779
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:11,710
I mean,
not even like a,

1780
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:16,120
maybe not an odor odor,
but like they just feel weird.

1781
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,700
You know,
they said that,

1782
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,380
um,
Chris Ryan,

1783
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,540
my friend of WHO's,
um,

1784
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:23,380
um,
he,

1785
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,690
he's a author.
He wrote a sex at dawn.

1786
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,460
Yeah.
He's great.

1787
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,380
Yeah,
Super Smart Guy.

1788
01:18:29,381 --> 01:18:34,381
He was telling me that there's certain
odors that human beings have and those

1789
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:39,430
odors enabled people to understand
whether or not they're genetically

1790
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,890
compatible with each other.
And you know,

1791
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:45,730
like they used to be when we were kids.
I used to always hear about couples

1792
01:18:45,731 --> 01:18:49,720
taking blood tests to make sure that
they could have babies together.

1793
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:51,370
Yeah.
That was a thing.

1794
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:53,830
That was a thing they would,
they would make sure that they were

1795
01:18:53,831 --> 01:18:54,670
compatible.

1796
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:57,070
And I don't even know if there's real
science behind it,

1797
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,670
but they would take blood tests to find
out they were compatible.

1798
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,360
That was like,
I remember it being like really common

1799
01:19:04,361 --> 01:19:06,040
to discuss.
I mean it was,

1800
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,960
this is,
uh,

1801
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,310
the eighties or the nineties or whatever
the fuck it was.

1802
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,620
The dark ages of science.
It was that easy,

1803
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:13,180
right?
Yeah.

1804
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:16,930
But not compatible obviously personality
wise and all the other things that come

1805
01:19:16,931 --> 01:19:18,580
into play.
But they were,

1806
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,570
he,
Chris Ryan was saying that women can

1807
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:26,980
smell a man's clothes.
Like you could smell,

1808
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:31,450
literally smelled their clothes and they
would know whether or not they would be

1809
01:19:31,451 --> 01:19:36,451
attracted to that person based on the
smell that a person's getting.

1810
01:19:36,491 --> 01:19:37,210
Not,
not like,

1811
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,290
oh my God,
this guy stinks.

1812
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:43,480
But like literally like you,
your body knows what's repulsive and

1813
01:19:43,481 --> 01:19:47,440
what's not repulsive in terms of like
genetics based on someone's odor that

1814
01:19:47,441 --> 01:19:48,610
they give off on their clothes.

1815
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,730
But what it didn't work is when they put
women on the pill.

1816
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,940
Ha.
So when they put women on the pill,

1817
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:58,060
they were no longer able to
differentiate whether or not someone was

1818
01:19:58,061 --> 01:20:01,870
genetically compatible by smelling them
that it gave you,

1819
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,590
it fogged up your,
your natural senses.

1820
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:09,090
Because I think when you're on pill you
don't actually articulate.

1821
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,043
Right,
right.

1822
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,990
So you're not in the natural rhythm of
biology.

1823
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,480
Yeah.
I think there's a natural feeling that

1824
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:20,340
women have when they're around a guy
that they would breed with or a guy they

1825
01:20:20,341 --> 01:20:22,500
wouldn't breed with.
Kay got to go,

1826
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,530
you know,
like that and that is probably a good

1827
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:27,510
thing.
And that people that are on the pill

1828
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:30,420
might be making like really shitty
genetic choices,

1829
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:32,600
like literally genetic choices.
Ah,

1830
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,450
you can blame your last bad ex boyfriend
on being on the pill.

1831
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,510
You could give us now I'm accurately,
I really think you can.

1832
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:41,730
I mean it totally makes sense.
I probably,

1833
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:43,830
Chris is probably listening right now.
Go and you fucked it up.

1834
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,720
I probably did.
But I think there's probably something

1835
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:51,990
to instinctual reactions to people.
Yeah.

1836
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,831
Like,
I mean,

1837
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:55,530
have you ever met someone and like for
whatever reason,

1838
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:57,000
I just don't want to be around,
that's for sure.

1839
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:01,110
And then you find out years later that
that person's fucking crazy or this or

1840
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:02,310
that.
There's,

1841
01:21:02,311 --> 01:21:07,311
I think people give off in detectable in
terms of like what we classify as

1842
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:10,350
smells,
but maybe these pheromones have some

1843
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:13,800
sort of a weird reaction to your birth
control pills affects women's taste in

1844
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:14,700
men.
Bam.

1845
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:17,460
Wow.
How synthetic hormones changed desires

1846
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:20,380
and women and their choice of a mate
intimate.

1847
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:22,620
Yeah,
totally.

1848
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:24,750
Makes Sense.
Interesting.

1849
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,400
Yeah.
Well it just makes sense.

1850
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:29,190
I mean it just can't be,
nor your body must be so confused.

1851
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,020
Like this pitch is pregnant all the
time.

1852
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,510
I know.
I know.

1853
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,430
That's what it thinks.
Your body thinks you're pregnant all the

1854
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:36,270
time.
I know.

1855
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,140
That's,
yeah,

1856
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,980
the pill scares me too.
Just synthetic hormones pumping through

1857
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:42,180
your system.
Yeah.

1858
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,750
Tim can't be all that good to never get
off.

1859
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:48,720
But a lot of women never get off it
right there on it forever.

1860
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,531
Yup.
Yeah.

1861
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,690
I don't like it.
It makes my hair oily when I'm off it.

1862
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,640
Yup.
Here's stuff like that.

1863
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,410
There's other ways to balance your
hormones.

1864
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,880
You know,
I'm not a hormone specialist,

1865
01:21:56,881 --> 01:21:59,610
but why does hormones make a girl's hair
oily?

1866
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,950
I don't know.
I have no idea.

1867
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,940
How do we get on the subject?
Smells.

1868
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,250
Retreats.
You don't take dudes,

1869
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,110
dudes on retreats.
Yeah,

1870
01:22:10,111 --> 01:22:12,270
I would think that like getting a bunch
of people that try and get their life

1871
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:14,190
together and then having them all
together.

1872
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:18,260
A male and female.
Do you run into these weird issues were,

1873
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,050
you know,
they're really just trying to hook up?

1874
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:20,920
Yeah,
exactly.

1875
01:22:20,921 --> 01:22:22,780
You can get really distracted and you
can get,

1876
01:22:22,781 --> 01:22:27,070
like if there's some kind of attraction,
you can forget what you're there for and

1877
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:30,610
get obsessed with someone and,
and it can kind of throw off the thing

1878
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:33,280
and there's something too about,

1879
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,050
okay,

1880
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,180
you know,
women coming together with women and men

1881
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:38,130
coming together with men.
That I think is important.

1882
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:41,310
And I think kind of back to that tribal
conversation we need,

1883
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:44,070
I got a lot of women,
including myself,

1884
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:46,170
have like beef with other women,
you know,

1885
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,510
and they don't like being around just a
bunch of other women.

1886
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,010
Like there's competition that comes up
and you thought,

1887
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,150
oh,
well I used to because I was scared of

1888
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:56,280
other women because I had all that stuff
happen.

1889
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,860
I didn't really trust it.
Um,

1890
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,120
and so when you get a group of women
together,

1891
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:03,360
a lot of times there is that like
comparison and judgment and I can't

1892
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:05,980
trust and did it.
And so it's important for women,

1893
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:10,981
I think to gather together and kind of
do work separately from when there's men

1894
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:14,950
there because there's something that is
very healing just in that.

1895
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,720
And then you know,
it just,

1896
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,740
there's a level of vulnerability that's
possible when there aren't men.

1897
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:23,770
They're not to say that you can't be
vulnerable with men there,

1898
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:26,230
but it's just a different dynamic.
And I think the same goes for Matt and

1899
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:28,900
like,
I know man who do men's groups and men's

1900
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:32,950
work and there's great value in that.
And that's important.

1901
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:37,090
And I think one of the problems I see a
lot in intimate relationships is that in

1902
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:41,020
a heterosexual relationship is that you
expect this one person to be your

1903
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:44,680
everything and you're not,
you don't have a tribe and you don't

1904
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:46,930
have a community.
You don't have friends of the opposite

1905
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:50,980
sex in the same sex that are fulfilling
kind of these needs it that we all have.

1906
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:54,730
We just project like this.
My one person has to be my everything,

1907
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:56,770
my soulmate.
And so,

1908
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:58,090
you know,
having your community,

1909
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:00,280
whatever it may be,
and having different friends I think is

1910
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:02,110
super,
super important to having a healthy

1911
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:02,944
relationship.

1912
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,980
Yeah.
Having friends period is super

1913
01:24:04,981 --> 01:24:06,720
important.
There's something that I tweeted today

1914
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:09,140
that I was reading about.
Um,

1915
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:14,180
they were talking about the role that
genetics and family have in creating a

1916
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:19,221
personality and how much of an impact
your peers have and they think that your

1917
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:24,471
peers and the friends you choose have a
bigger impact than anything in your

1918
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:25,374
life.
Yeah.

1919
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,650
And it was really fascinating.
I,

1920
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,940
I tweeted this morning for on it,
but it's,

1921
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,970
it's one of those articles where you
read it and you go,

1922
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,430
oh,
that completely makes sense.

1923
01:24:35,431 --> 01:24:39,630
Researcher argues that peers are much
more important than parents.

1924
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:43,530
That psychologist underestimate the
power of genetics and that we have a lot

1925
01:24:43,531 --> 01:24:47,250
to learn from Asian classrooms.
Interesting.

1926
01:24:47,251 --> 01:24:48,140
Yeah.
What about it?

1927
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,050
What about Asian classrooms?
You have to go down,

1928
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,200
scroll,
forgot what that was about.

1929
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:55,240
I don't know.
Probably too long of an article to

1930
01:24:55,241 --> 01:24:57,000
really get into it,
but um,

1931
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:57,923
we'd have to read it.

1932
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:03,170
But peers in general,
I think I'm choosing likeminded folks

1933
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:05,850
and choosing people that are on a good
path.

1934
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:06,890
They,
it,

1935
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:11,700
it helps support you and it supports
them and you feed off of each other.

1936
01:25:11,701 --> 01:25:13,590
And when the tribe does well,
you do well.

1937
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:14,810
Exactly.
This is very,

1938
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,320
it's very critical.
And people,

1939
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,090
they,
everybody wants to be the person that's

1940
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:20,610
accomplishing things.
Everybody wants to be the one,

1941
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:23,430
it's out there.
Go get nit and fuck the world's all

1942
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:25,500
about me.
But if you do that,

1943
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,150
you like,
you're gonna,

1944
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:29,520
you're gonna mess up the whole happiness
thing.

1945
01:25:29,521 --> 01:25:33,750
Like the happiness thing comes with all
the people that you're around having a

1946
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:34,450
good time.

1947
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:36,010
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1948
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,900
And,
and then it's just like,

1949
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:41,710
it's endless.
You have to keep upping the ante.

1950
01:25:41,711 --> 01:25:44,200
Yeah.
And I think what we want more than

1951
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:45,820
anything is connection.
Yeah.

1952
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:50,170
We want connection.
We want love what you want to feel like

1953
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:53,140
we belong to.
So I think belonging is a huge,

1954
01:25:53,141 --> 01:25:54,070
huge,
huge thing.

1955
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:58,390
And I think as adults we think we belong
by,

1956
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,160
you know,
achieving things.

1957
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:04,040
But really it's finding those people
that you can just be yourself

1958
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,520
with and to have that tribe and,
and also let go of the people that are

1959
01:26:07,521 --> 01:26:11,210
bringing you down.
Like I've outgrown some people in my

1960
01:26:11,211 --> 01:26:13,160
life and some friends,
not that I'm better than,

1961
01:26:13,161 --> 01:26:16,610
but I'm just on like a different,
different path in a different route.

1962
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:20,420
And it's important I think to kind of
know like who's the sort of dead weight

1963
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:23,270
and your life and what are some
friendships that might have reached

1964
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:25,430
their expiration date that,
you know,

1965
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:26,740
like,
I love you,

1966
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,520
that's been great.
But you know,

1967
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,750
and a lot of those friendships,
like you're not helping them either know

1968
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:34,150
you.
And matter of fact sometimes when

1969
01:26:34,151 --> 01:26:35,650
someone cuts you loose,
you go,

1970
01:26:35,651 --> 01:26:36,910
wow,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

1971
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,710
Maybe I need to look at myself.
Right?

1972
01:26:38,711 --> 01:26:40,930
I mean sometimes when you enable a
friend,

1973
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,930
you're not only,
you're not doing yourself any good,

1974
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:45,490
right?
Not doing them any good either.

1975
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,170
Exactly.
That was a big Aha for me when,

1976
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:52,320
um,
my fiance broke up with me because I

1977
01:26:52,321 --> 01:26:54,840
very much like want it to be like the
victim in that.

1978
01:26:54,841 --> 01:26:56,520
But I had to look at,
Gosh,

1979
01:26:56,521 --> 01:26:59,280
what did I like?
What did I do?

1980
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,031
Because everybody's like,
oh,

1981
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:00,950
he's such a jerk,
Dah,

1982
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:01,301
Dah,
Dah.

1983
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:06,301
But I really had to look at how was I
showing up in that relationship that was

1984
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,750
impacting his decision because he wasn't
a bad guy.

1985
01:27:09,751 --> 01:27:11,820
Like he wasn't just a jerk who decided,
you know,

1986
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:15,600
I'm going to break up with this girl.
Like there were ways I was showing up

1987
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:18,360
that were,
that like made him make the decision

1988
01:27:18,361 --> 01:27:20,550
that he makes.
So I think in any of this situations,

1989
01:27:20,551 --> 01:27:22,500
friendship or relationship,
you know,

1990
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:24,120
you don't,
you don't want to go too far the other

1991
01:27:24,121 --> 01:27:25,230
extreme and be like,
oh my gosh,

1992
01:27:25,231 --> 01:27:27,900
I'm a loser and think it's all your
fault.

1993
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:30,000
But it's important to look at,
Jeez,

1994
01:27:30,001 --> 01:27:31,320
what's my part in this?
You know,

1995
01:27:31,321 --> 01:27:35,700
what's my responsibility because I
played a role in this whole thing.

1996
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:36,900
Yeah.
They,

1997
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,510
I mean there's no one way street when it
comes to relationship.

1998
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:42,360
And if you're in a relationship with a
bad person,

1999
01:27:42,361 --> 01:27:43,940
like why,
why exactly,

2000
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,570
why did you get in that in the first
place?

2001
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,700
And they trick you.
You know,

2002
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,220
if they did trick you ha,
you know,

2003
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,850
what did you do when you realize it was
a trek?

2004
01:27:50,851 --> 01:27:52,800
Did you stick around and try to fix it?
Yeah,

2005
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:56,040
I think that's a really good question
because I mean,

2006
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:58,260
how many people do you know that are in
bad relationships?

2007
01:27:58,261 --> 01:28:01,320
Continue talking about it but don't,
aren't doing anything about it.

2008
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:04,980
Like they're not brutal.
They're not leaving it and it a brutal

2009
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,580
are cause there's,
did you just like,

2010
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:11,850
why?
But a lot of times it's because it's

2011
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:15,960
familiar and it's date what there's
somebody said,

2012
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,100
um,
you know,

2013
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:22,020
you get the love you think you deserve
and it may be easy for us looking

2014
01:28:22,021 --> 01:28:23,070
outside going,
oh my gosh,

2015
01:28:23,071 --> 01:28:24,450
it's so easy.
You should just like leave this

2016
01:28:24,451 --> 01:28:26,670
relationship.
But a lot of times the person like

2017
01:28:26,671 --> 01:28:29,880
doesn't think they can do better.
Or maybe this is like playing out some

2018
01:28:29,881 --> 01:28:31,830
dynamic they had with their parent or
you know,

2019
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,610
you sort of need to understand why
you're in it before you can actually

2020
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,200
make the choice to get out of it.

2021
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,130
By the way,
there's a lot of delusional people out

2022
01:28:39,131 --> 01:28:41,950
there that are like,
I deserve a lot more than I'm getting.

2023
01:28:41,951 --> 01:28:43,990
That's true.
That's not really there.

2024
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,970
That's true.
What do you do when someone comes to you

2025
01:28:45,971 --> 01:28:50,350
with unrealistic expectations or they
don't want to see themselves like you

2026
01:28:50,351 --> 01:28:50,770
know,
you,

2027
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:54,940
you tell them what they need to do or
what they should consider and they argue

2028
01:28:54,941 --> 01:28:55,774
with you about it.

2029
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,910
Well,
I just really ask like,

2030
01:28:57,940 --> 01:29:01,830
is what you're doing working like is
your working?

2031
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:05,080
If you can show me your ways working
then great.

2032
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:07,540
My way's fine.
This is fucking the other people.

2033
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,660
Everybody else.
Everybody else is all messed up.

2034
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:13,750
I'm good.
God dammit.

2035
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,820
Yeah.
I need you to coach everyone else.

2036
01:29:15,821 --> 01:29:16,654
I know.

2037
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,390
Yeah.
If we could just change other people.

2038
01:29:19,391 --> 01:29:21,640
It's everybody else's fault.
Yup.

2039
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:24,320
Do you ever have to tell people you're
not going to work with them?

2040
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:26,830
I've had one person I had to tell that
too.

2041
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,400
Yup.
Just one and it was,

2042
01:29:30,401 --> 01:29:32,440
you know,
I think it was,

2043
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:35,860
it was just not a good fit and she just
wasn't ready,

2044
01:29:35,861 --> 01:29:39,970
willing.
The super committed to her story and

2045
01:29:39,971 --> 01:29:43,450
sort of wanted me just to cuddle it,
which I wasn't willing to do.

2046
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:45,100
Yeah.
Sometimes people just want someone.

2047
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,900
That's what I've always wondered about
therapy.

2048
01:29:46,901 --> 01:29:48,250
Like I have friends that have been the
therapy.

2049
01:29:48,251 --> 01:29:48,620
I'm like,
okay,

2050
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,980
what do you do when you go there and
talk about your problems and then what

2051
01:29:50,981 --> 01:29:51,611
happens?
Well,

2052
01:29:51,611 --> 01:29:53,440
they give you advice and then what
happens?

2053
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:55,240
You don't have to shit.
You know,

2054
01:29:55,241 --> 01:29:58,540
like there's a lot of people that just
want to go somewhere and want someone to

2055
01:29:58,541 --> 01:30:00,400
listen to them talk.
Right?

2056
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,380
Right.
They'll go three,

2057
01:30:02,381 --> 01:30:04,720
four times a week and they're still
fucked up.

2058
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:05,381
Yup.
I'm like,

2059
01:30:05,381 --> 01:30:07,030
well that isn't working.
Yeah,

2060
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:12,410
it doesn't and I think my intention
always is to really give people the

2061
01:30:12,411 --> 01:30:14,930
tools,
not just advice really helped them heal

2062
01:30:14,931 --> 01:30:16,760
really good.
I've had amazing teachers have been

2063
01:30:16,761 --> 01:30:20,030
really,
really lucky and they've really taught,

2064
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:23,330
they haven't just given me advice,
they haven't just given me motivation.

2065
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:28,750
They've really given me tools to heal
and change and that's,

2066
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:34,450
that's what I try to do in my work with
people is show them that that a as

2067
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:38,930
possible and they and that it can do it
and give them the tools to do it because

2068
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:41,410
that's what that's going to last longer
than any kind of like

2069
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,940
pep talk.
It was funny,

2070
01:30:42,941 --> 01:30:46,330
we were talking before the podcast
started about going to a seminar and

2071
01:30:46,331 --> 01:30:51,331
someone asking how many men here feel
vulnerable and like no one's putting

2072
01:30:52,061 --> 01:30:54,580
their hand up.
How many women here feel vulnerable?

2073
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,250
All the hands went up,
all the hands went up.

2074
01:30:57,970 --> 01:31:00,460
And I mean,
part of it I think is a little

2075
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:03,310
delusional because I think a lot of men
are way more vulnerable than they really

2076
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:06,730
think they are.
But also this does just a different

2077
01:31:06,731 --> 01:31:11,050
thing going through live.
I mean there's that expression,

2078
01:31:11,051 --> 01:31:13,840
the fair sex or,
but being a female,

2079
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:16,510
being a woman means you're,
you're physically different.

2080
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,380
Yup.
You're up a bunch of people that most of

2081
01:31:20,381 --> 01:31:22,510
them could beat you up.
Yep.

2082
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:23,890
You know,
that's,

2083
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,200
it's a different way to walk through the
world.

2084
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:31,230
That vulnerability though is that
creates another level of anxiety,

2085
01:31:31,721 --> 01:31:33,880
right?
Like walking down a dark street,

2086
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:38,590
you see someone and it's a man and he's
walking down the dark street too.

2087
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,743
You're like,
oh,

2088
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:40,970
you know,

2089
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:41,570
yeah.
It's,

2090
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:45,590
it's scary and it's something that,
you know,

2091
01:31:45,591 --> 01:31:48,740
I as a woman,
like I'm always aware of it.

2092
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,690
Not always,
but a lot of the time,

2093
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,560
you know,
cause I,

2094
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,630
I know that like,
like you said,

2095
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,500
I could get beaten up.
Like,

2096
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,910
it's between me and a man.
He's probably going to,

2097
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,160
I mean I'm pretty strong but

2098
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,950
not that strong.
And I,

2099
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,980
I think what's also beautiful about
women and just the feminine in general

2100
01:32:05,981 --> 01:32:08,950
is that vulnerability.
But because like at sometimes it has,

2101
01:32:08,951 --> 01:32:11,320
it feels safe.
I think that's why a lot of women like

2102
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:15,190
kind of have a protective armor and are
guarded and sometimes more on there like

2103
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,330
masculine energy in the world is because
on some level we feel like we have to,

2104
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:23,200
we have to like protect ourselves and
whereas that,

2105
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:27,010
that vulnerability you really is the
thing that makes us women in so many

2106
01:32:27,011 --> 01:32:29,770
ways not.
And I think we confuse vulnerability

2107
01:32:29,771 --> 01:32:34,771
with weakness because vulnerability to
me is being open,

2108
01:32:35,891 --> 01:32:38,510
being available,
being um,

2109
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:43,720
soft but not weak.
Weakness to me is more about kind of

2110
01:32:43,721 --> 01:32:48,040
going into the victim me and going into
that poor pitiful me and the feeling

2111
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:50,140
sorry for and on all of those kinds of
things.

2112
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,210
I think there's beautiful power and
vulnerability,

2113
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:55,210
but when we're talking about just
physical strength,

2114
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:58,450
yeah.
I mean for the most part men have the

2115
01:32:58,451 --> 01:32:59,320
advantage on that one.

2116
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:04,090
It's just we need all the pieces,
right?

2117
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,090
You need the whole spectrum of human
beings,

2118
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,100
right?
And you know what I mean?

2119
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,510
Especially in terms of,
you know,

2120
01:33:11,511 --> 01:33:14,290
you did the traditional way of looking
at things.

2121
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:17,170
You know,
masculine men are attracted to feminine

2122
01:33:17,171 --> 01:33:21,010
women and Feminine Women are attracted
to masculine men and we both need each

2123
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:23,410
other.
But a lot of times,

2124
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:25,750
especially when you're dealing with
damaged folks,

2125
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:31,440
you're dealing with a man who has a
vulnerable woman and the man's all

2126
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:33,670
fucked up.
So he takes it out on a vulnerable

2127
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:36,550
woman.
And the vulnerable woman is like under

2128
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:37,960
the,
you know,

2129
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:41,500
the,
the pressure of the relationship or the

2130
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:43,780
suppression of being connected to this
man.

2131
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:47,080
And so you kind of dealing with the same
dynamic that you were dealing with when

2132
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:52,000
you were in school or someone's bullying
you and you get it in this relationship.

2133
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,590
Then instead of someone appreciating you
for the difference in the softness

2134
01:33:56,591 --> 01:33:58,150
versus the hard,
the Yin and the Yang,

2135
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:01,120
now you have someone who is exploiting
that,

2136
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:03,460
right?
And you see it with women too and they

2137
01:34:03,461 --> 01:34:06,100
see it with like aggressive women and
weak men.

2138
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:07,270
Yeah.
That is,

2139
01:34:07,271 --> 01:34:10,090
to me,
one of the saddest things I ever see is

2140
01:34:10,091 --> 01:34:14,470
when you find the aggressive women and
the weak man cut.

2141
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,510
Probably because I'm terrified of it
ever being mean.

2142
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,420
You know,
I don't think it will be.

2143
01:34:19,421 --> 01:34:19,941
I don't think,
well,

2144
01:34:19,941 --> 01:34:21,700
I mean if it was,
you know,

2145
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:24,670
nobody wants that.
Nobody wants the woman who's yelling at

2146
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:26,160
Ya and,
and it goes,

2147
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:27,480
we go cuckoo cuckoo.

2148
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:29,950
I that happens a lot and then,
oh,

2149
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,630
a lot,
a lot.

2150
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:35,580
It's Kinda crazy to me because,
you know,

2151
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:39,520
I see women emasculate men quite often,
you know,

2152
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,360
not maybe on like a huge scale to the
degree you're talking about,

2153
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:46,450
but just like the little comments,
like I'll be out with a couple and the

2154
01:34:46,451 --> 01:34:50,740
woman will say something and it's,
it's kind of emasculating burn.

2155
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:54,700
If the roles were reversed and the guy
said something like that to the woman,

2156
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:56,280
I don't know if it would go over,
you know,

2157
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:58,070
guys just kind of take it

2158
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,590
on on sometimes.
And then when I see that,

2159
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:04,670
I'm like,
well a lot of men feel emasculated by

2160
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:08,090
society in general,
just by the roles that they play in the

2161
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:09,200
office.
And the,

2162
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:10,140
just the,
the,

2163
01:35:10,150 --> 01:35:15,150
the physical act of going through life.
It's civilized world and also constantly

2164
01:35:16,371 --> 01:35:21,371
needing people's affirmation,
needing people's acceptance.

2165
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:22,480
And,
and you,

2166
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:25,970
you sort of become what people want you
to be,

2167
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:30,270
even if that's not what you want.
You get in these relationships and you

2168
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:34,430
see it all the time where a guy sort of
accept a little bit and then they accept

2169
01:35:34,431 --> 01:35:36,380
more and then they don't want to mess
up.

2170
01:35:36,381 --> 01:35:38,960
And then they,
I have a bunch of friends that have like

2171
01:35:38,961 --> 01:35:42,440
really domineering,
overbearing wives or girlfriends.

2172
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,990
And it's weird.
It's weird to be around them.

2173
01:35:44,991 --> 01:35:45,381
Like,
dude,

2174
01:35:45,381 --> 01:35:46,220
you know,
you can leave.

2175
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,660
Like,
he just like,

2176
01:35:47,661 --> 01:35:48,680
this is just a person.

2177
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:50,870
Do you think they,
cause they're scared,

2178
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,960
they're scared and it becomes the thing,
you know,

2179
01:35:53,961 --> 01:35:55,040
that's,
that's the thing,

2180
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:56,800
this is the thing.
Or go out of the fucking wife,

2181
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:58,400
we're going to go home to the wife,
you know?

2182
01:35:58,401 --> 01:35:59,630
And it's,
it's,

2183
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:02,240
it's very strange.
It's very strange when you have someone

2184
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:05,150
in your life that's essentially like a
parole officer,

2185
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:08,630
so many life that gets to tell you what
to do and you're not allowed to do

2186
01:36:08,631 --> 01:36:10,940
certain things.
You're not allowed to watch certain

2187
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:14,600
things or like certain things and they
control you and they own you.

2188
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:16,130
I mean this,
this,

2189
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:20,990
and I think a lot of these people that
are doing that much like the girl who

2190
01:36:20,991 --> 01:36:23,630
bullied you or any,
anybody who does that to someone,

2191
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:26,180
they,
they do it out of,

2192
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:28,850
out of fear.
They do it at an insecurity and they

2193
01:36:28,851 --> 01:36:31,730
also do it out of this bizarre instinct
because they can,

2194
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,940
I state this girl,
she wasn't a bad person,

2195
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:37,040
but she used to like to fight and I
don't,

2196
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,903
I do not.

2197
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:40,520
I do not like to,
I don't like that kind of conflict.

2198
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:42,470
I don't like,
like in a relationship conflict.

2199
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,670
I don't do,
I don't like it.

2200
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:45,680
I don't fight and argue.
I just rather leave.

2201
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:46,890
I'm like,
I'll end.

2202
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:49,490
I'm into discussing things,
but when people start yelling and get

2203
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:50,211
crazy,
I'm like,

2204
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:52,370
fuck this.
I grew up,

2205
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:55,970
I grew up around domestic violence too.
I grew up with the,

2206
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,880
so I saw it when I was a kid.
I just,

2207
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:01,910
I'm not interested.
And um,

2208
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:05,750
so we broke up,
but we stayed friends and then years

2209
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,550
later,
um,

2210
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:08,600
we went out to coffee and like,
how's everything?

2211
01:37:08,601 --> 01:37:09,500
What's going on?
Oh,

2212
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:11,390
I'm living this guy.
It's not going good.

2213
01:37:11,391 --> 01:37:11,931
And like,
why?

2214
01:37:11,931 --> 01:37:14,750
She's like,
she's telling me how she yells at this

2215
01:37:14,751 --> 01:37:17,120
guy and she can't help it.
She's like,

2216
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:20,750
I can't help it.
I just fucking yell at him and he

2217
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:21,650
doesn't do anything.

2218
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:23,540
He just takes it.
And she's like,

2219
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:25,880
when he takes it,
I just want to fucking smash him.

2220
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,500
She's like,
I just can't,

2221
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:28,760
she goes,
I don't want to yell at them,

2222
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:30,890
but I can't help doing it.
And then when he's gone,

2223
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:32,330
I'm like,
why the fuck did I do that?

2224
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:37,780
And she had this weird,
almost like a natural impulse to

2225
01:37:38,991 --> 01:37:41,900
dominate this guy.
Like if you ever seen two dogs,

2226
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:46,880
one dog has the upper hand on the,
on the dog and he'll go near the dog and

2227
01:37:46,881 --> 01:37:48,410
the other dog.
And that's just,

2228
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,840
that's just their world.
That's just their world.

2229
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:54,830
But the other dog never gets a chance.
And sometimes it's not even a size based

2230
01:37:54,831 --> 01:37:56,790
thing,
like it might be the exact same size

2231
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:59,370
dog,
just one dog just decides the bitch and

2232
01:37:59,371 --> 01:38:01,790
the other one's the dominator.
And that's just how it goes.

2233
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:02,401
Right.
Well,

2234
01:38:02,401 --> 01:38:06,720
she was in this position with this guy
where she just had this compelling

2235
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,330
desire to fucking yell at them.
And I go,

2236
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:10,580
well,
what are you yelling at him for her?

2237
01:38:10,581 --> 01:38:11,610
She's like,
anything,

2238
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,230
everything.
She goes,

2239
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:14,460
I just,
I just fucking,

2240
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,500
I want him to tell me to shut the fuck
up.

2241
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,730
Yeah.
She wanted him to out manner.

2242
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:20,790
Yeah.
But isn't that crazy?

2243
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:24,330
Like what a bizarre instinct to like,
to,

2244
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:27,900
to push and like she was frustrated at
herself.

2245
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:31,380
She was frustrated at him,
but it's almost like she was compelled,

2246
01:38:31,381 --> 01:38:33,870
like,
she's being drawn to the great magnet,

2247
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:35,100
you know?
It's like,

2248
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,030
Oh yeah,
hell,

2249
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:37,350
but I'm gonna scream at him.
Right.

2250
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:40,420
Well,
it's interesting like how we project on

2251
01:38:40,421 --> 01:38:41,800
to other people,
you know,

2252
01:38:41,801 --> 01:38:44,140
like whatever.
Some of them was going on inside of her

2253
01:38:44,141 --> 01:38:46,660
that was like creating that dynamic in
him.

2254
01:38:46,661 --> 01:38:49,750
And she could have left at any time,
but it was like she was so trying to get

2255
01:38:49,751 --> 01:38:54,100
a reaction out of him honestly to
probably see if he cared.

2256
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,870
Like she probably equated.
All right,

2257
01:38:55,871 --> 01:38:57,820
well him taking it means he doesn't
care.

2258
01:38:57,850 --> 01:39:00,310
So how much can I push?
How much can I push?

2259
01:39:00,311 --> 01:39:02,520
How can I match?
Can I push so that I can see that he,

2260
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,140
he'll react enough cause that means,

2261
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:06,590
do you think that's what it is?
That she didn't think he cares if you

2262
01:39:06,591 --> 01:39:09,590
think she just thinks he's weak and it's
just frustrating to her that he's weak?

2263
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,370
Well if it was just that,
I think she would have left a lot

2264
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:14,140
earlier.
There was something she wanted.

2265
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:18,340
Like we don't keep doing it over and
over and over again unless there's

2266
01:39:18,341 --> 01:39:20,380
something more attached to getting.
Like,

2267
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:22,150
you know when we're just went and we're
like,

2268
01:39:22,151 --> 01:39:23,050
Oh man,
this is stupid.

2269
01:39:23,051 --> 01:39:26,350
We get out of there.
But when we find ourselves in situations

2270
01:39:26,351 --> 01:39:29,680
where it's like it's happening over and
over and over again and we continue to

2271
01:39:29,681 --> 01:39:33,100
get frustrated but we're not leaving,
there's something we're attached to

2272
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:37,300
trying to get from our behavior.
So there was something she wanted and

2273
01:39:37,301 --> 01:39:39,700
that there was something in it for her.
Otherwise she had been out of there a

2274
01:39:39,701 --> 01:39:40,534
lot sooner.

2275
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:42,140
I wonder.
It was also,

2276
01:39:42,141 --> 01:39:45,860
she was trying to do the acting thing
and she was constantly frustrated.

2277
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,620
Yeah,
she was constantly just taking it out on

2278
01:39:48,621 --> 01:39:49,340
him.
Yeah.

2279
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:52,820
Well that it was,
it would be really interesting.

2280
01:39:52,821 --> 01:39:55,640
Like I'd watch these like almost sort of
manic things.

2281
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:58,840
Like there would be these moments where
you know,

2282
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:02,600
she would be preparing for an audition
and she'd be hopeful yet nervous.

2283
01:40:02,601 --> 01:40:04,580
There was a lot of anxiety and there was
all this,

2284
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:07,170
here's the thing and it's going to,
things going to go on the,

2285
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:09,980
hopefully if this happens,
this guy is connected to this and that's

2286
01:40:09,981 --> 01:40:12,950
going to happen with that and then boom,
it didn't happen.

2287
01:40:12,951 --> 01:40:14,960
And so there's this massive let down,
right?

2288
01:40:14,961 --> 01:40:18,530
This is cigarette smoking and depression
and you know,

2289
01:40:18,531 --> 01:40:20,210
all this angst.
Yup.

2290
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,420
And um,
I got the fuck out of there.

2291
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:26,880
Yeah.
This dude got in there like,

2292
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,060
and he caught it.

2293
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:31,400
He caught the second wave of anx.
Yeah.

2294
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:33,460
When I met her she was just moving here.
Yeah.

2295
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,670
And so she wasn't completely bewildered
by the experience in the machine yet.

2296
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,350
Yeah.
And um,

2297
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:43,790
it's also,
I think for some people choosing things

2298
01:40:43,791 --> 01:40:47,240
that you do for a living that are
healthy for you.

2299
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:52,040
I think there's a lot of people that get
involved in careers that require too

2300
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:54,610
much of their time.
You don't really want to do it,

2301
01:40:54,611 --> 01:40:57,400
but you get caught up in it,
whether it's being a lawyer or being a

2302
01:40:57,401 --> 01:41:00,820
doctor or being something that has a
prestigious title when you feel like

2303
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:04,030
there's something great tech,
but really in the back of your mind,

2304
01:41:04,031 --> 01:41:07,270
there's something else that you probably
would be way happier doing.

2305
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:10,060
That was me.
I was going after it for the wrong

2306
01:41:10,061 --> 01:41:11,800
reasons.
What do you want to do though?

2307
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:14,380
If you weren't doing the life coach,
I know you enjoy doing what you're

2308
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:16,780
doing,
but do you have like if somehow or

2309
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:20,140
another you were independently wealthy
and you didn't have to coach all these

2310
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:20,630
crazy people?

2311
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:22,610
Plenty more.
Not that they're crazy,

2312
01:41:22,611 --> 01:41:25,940
but some of them will probably do it.
I mean like I,

2313
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:31,190
you know,
I love people and I love personal

2314
01:41:31,191 --> 01:41:32,930
development.
Even if I had all the money in the

2315
01:41:32,931 --> 01:41:34,550
world,
I'd still speak.

2316
01:41:34,551 --> 01:41:37,580
I'd still do my podcast,
I'd still do retreats.

2317
01:41:37,581 --> 01:41:39,770
I,
I love it.

2318
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:43,760
Like I love the human experience.
I love being there for that moment where

2319
01:41:43,761 --> 01:41:47,240
someone has a major insight where they
connect dots and it's like,

2320
01:41:47,241 --> 01:41:50,090
Whoa,
a massive perspective shift and like all

2321
01:41:50,091 --> 01:41:53,030
of a sudden they start to kind of move a
different direction.

2322
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:55,970
It's,
I can't imagine doing anything else.

2323
01:41:55,971 --> 01:41:57,350
I mean,
if I could sing,

2324
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:00,350
if I had any kind of music ability,
I think it'd be awesome to be a

2325
01:42:00,351 --> 01:42:02,210
rockstar.
Like just to have that rush.

2326
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:07,660
But literally I have no musical ability
whatsoever other than like listening to

2327
01:42:08,031 --> 01:42:09,360
it.
I'm just do not have,

2328
01:42:09,361 --> 01:42:09,640
yeah.

2329
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,320
Well that's great.
So you found your thing.

2330
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,170
Now,
how often is it when you talk to be,

2331
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:15,880
but when you're trying to coach them and
help them and you realize like,

2332
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:18,100
man,
you got to do something else.

2333
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:20,050
Like is that a,
is that a factor?

2334
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:24,550
Cause I would think that the thing about
careers is not only is it eight hours of

2335
01:42:24,551 --> 01:42:26,470
your time,
but it also kind of defines you.

2336
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,380
So every day you're defined by whatever
you do.

2337
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:30,760
Right.
And oftentimes,

2338
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:33,850
like we were talking about like men in
these workplace environments,

2339
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,600
there's sort of like,
they're boxed into this predetermined

2340
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:39,520
pattern and behavior that's expected
from them.

2341
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:41,290
You know,
they have shoes with tassels on them and

2342
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:44,200
ties and they have to talk like,
you know,

2343
01:42:44,201 --> 01:42:46,990
business talk.
And it's like you fall into these weird

2344
01:42:46,991 --> 01:42:51,820
patterns and you lose a lot of your
individuality inside those patterns

2345
01:42:51,821 --> 01:42:56,821
because office life and you know,
human resources demands certain things

2346
01:42:57,161 --> 01:42:57,400
of you.

2347
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,700
Like there's a certain your,
your personality,

2348
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:05,800
like when you in an office environment,
anytime you're in the corporate world,

2349
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:10,990
your personality is stuffed into this
form,

2350
01:43:11,070 --> 01:43:11,740
right.
You know,

2351
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:13,750
whatever that form is,
whatever that mold is,

2352
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:16,540
the mold of being a business person,
you know,

2353
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:17,560
you know,
you're a woman,

2354
01:43:17,561 --> 01:43:20,350
you're a business woman.
You want to be respected and want to use

2355
01:43:20,351 --> 01:43:22,430
the right word to say the right things.
And Yeah,

2356
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,150
you know,
and,

2357
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:27,190
and talk the right lingo.
But did the,

2358
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,700
like a lot of times people are left
wondering who the fuck am I.

2359
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:31,580
Right,

2360
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:33,560
right.
They just get totally lost in a role.

2361
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:36,860
[inaudible] yeah.
And I do like I go do a lot of corporate

2362
01:43:36,861 --> 01:43:40,130
speaking and I have a lot of people come
up to me afterwards and they're just

2363
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,480
like,
oh my gosh.

2364
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:44,210
Like I'm cause I talk about,
you know,

2365
01:43:44,211 --> 01:43:48,230
how we lose ourselves in these roles and
how like a lot of times our adult life

2366
01:43:48,231 --> 01:43:52,370
becomes sort of just this like follow

2367
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,320
Truman show.
Like one thing after the other,

2368
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:57,190
just like follow this structure that was
set out for us.

2369
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,690
We never checked in and said,
do I want this?

2370
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:01,910
Like do I even want this?
You know?

2371
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:03,890
And so to answer your question,
yes,

2372
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:06,770
a lot of times when people come or I'm
working with people,

2373
01:44:06,771 --> 01:44:09,270
it is like looking at like,
is this cool?

2374
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:11,930
Is this career right for you?
Is this relationship right for you?

2375
01:44:11,931 --> 01:44:15,320
Like what have you created in your life
that just doesn't fit where you are?

2376
01:44:15,321 --> 01:44:17,510
But you're in it because you're scared
to make the change.

2377
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:18,831
And,
and also,

2378
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:22,130
you know,
some people really can be happy in

2379
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:23,870
corporate America,
like some people

2380
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:26,870
that works for them.
If you're strange freaks,

2381
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:27,381
I,
I'm,

2382
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:31,820
I firmly really believe that the vast
majority of people that are living the

2383
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:33,440
American dream,
living that life,

2384
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:37,850
doing that nine to five,
the vast majority of them are fucking

2385
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,580
horror.
Horrifically miserable.

2386
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:42,410
Yeah.
I really do believe that.

2387
01:44:42,411 --> 01:44:47,411
I think it's so defining and it's so,
it's so contrary to the human spirit.

2388
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,870
Right?
Right.

2389
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,410
And I think most people don't want to
believe that.

2390
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,750
They don't want to believe there's,
it's possible that everybody's doing

2391
01:44:53,751 --> 01:44:54,590
something wrong.
Right.

2392
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:56,490
And they don't believe they can change
it.

2393
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,300
Yeah.
There's no other option.

2394
01:44:58,301 --> 01:45:00,020
I don't know what else to do,
especially if they have,

2395
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:02,660
you know,
a mortgage and a spouse and kids doing

2396
01:45:02,661 --> 01:45:04,160
loans,
all that stuff.

2397
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:06,470
Yeah.
It's really intimidating to go,

2398
01:45:06,471 --> 01:45:07,460
oh gosh,
how do I,

2399
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,460
how do I change this?
I think you have to start small.

2400
01:45:10,461 --> 01:45:12,740
I think you have to start with,
okay,

2401
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:16,100
I don't have to quit my job tomorrow,
but what are some things in my life I

2402
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:18,620
can start doing that made me feel alive
again?

2403
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:21,770
Like is it a hobby?
Is it like training for a marathon?

2404
01:45:21,771 --> 01:45:24,950
Is it what is going to start making me
feel like,

2405
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:27,620
you know,
I'm creative and I matter and I'm more

2406
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:29,870
than just this role as husband,
wife,

2407
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:30,681
mother,
father,

2408
01:45:30,681 --> 01:45:33,020
corporate executive,
whatever it is.

2409
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:37,610
So I think that's a good place to start,
is something small you can do to make

2410
01:45:37,611 --> 01:45:39,860
you feel alive again,
because anybody has access to that,

2411
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:40,310
right?

2412
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:43,700
You don't have to leave your job to
start creating some things in your life

2413
01:45:43,701 --> 01:45:46,940
that can start to shift things.
And then like we were talking about then

2414
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:48,740
it's like the gradual change,
you know,

2415
01:45:48,741 --> 01:45:51,530
cause I don't think it's possible for
most people just to quit their job

2416
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:53,450
tomorrow.
They don't think it's possible.

2417
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:55,130
No one,
almost no one.

2418
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:57,140
Exactly.
And not everybody's meant to be an

2419
01:45:57,141 --> 01:45:59,300
entrepreneur either and do their own
thing,

2420
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:04,330
but there are always things we can do in
our life to mix it up a little bit and

2421
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:06,650
even just show up differently in our
job.

2422
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:10,980
Yeah,
I just think that for a huge amount of

2423
01:46:10,981 --> 01:46:13,950
people,
the amount of time that's required of

2424
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:14,670
them.
Yeah.

2425
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:19,380
Because of their job is so overwhelming
because most people,

2426
01:46:19,381 --> 01:46:22,980
let's be honest or not really just
working nine to five particularly most

2427
01:46:22,981 --> 01:46:25,110
men,
there's a tremendous amount of overtime

2428
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:26,680
involved.
I was looking at the,

2429
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:28,550
some thing there was talking about,
it was a,

2430
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:30,780
an article on the wage gap difference
and what,

2431
01:46:30,781 --> 01:46:33,720
what it really is about,
and one of the things it was about was

2432
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:37,350
the amount of the difference in the
amount of hours that men work and the in

2433
01:46:37,351 --> 01:46:40,110
their ambition to try to climb up the
corporate ladder.

2434
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:44,790
And you look at the numbers that people
work and it's terrifying.

2435
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,740
There's no lie.
If you're working 60 hours a week,

2436
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:50,430
you don't have a life,
there's nothing left.

2437
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,710
Yeah.
If I work here,

2438
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:55,920
I'll do a podcast for three hours and
I'll do a bunch of other stuff and you

2439
01:46:55,921 --> 01:46:57,900
know,
I'm trying to fit in things in my day

2440
01:46:57,901 --> 01:46:59,520
and I have a pretty loose schedule.

2441
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:00,900
I mean,
I do a lot of things,

2442
01:47:00,901 --> 01:47:02,670
but it's pretty loose.
You know,

2443
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:07,410
like today I did UFC stuff for a couple
hours this morning and then I come here

2444
01:47:07,411 --> 01:47:09,720
for a few hours,
then I got to work out and then it will

2445
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:13,110
tell some jokes.
But there's a lot of movement in there.

2446
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:14,880
There's a lot of time or I can get shit
done.

2447
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,680
Yeah.
Some people don't have any of that.

2448
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:21,740
It have nothing like that made you
different like back in the day where you

2449
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:26,370
could have done that path of the
corporate route.

2450
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:29,610
Why did you make different choices?
It's a good question.

2451
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,473
I Dunno.
Probably,

2452
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,190
I don't know.
I don't know.

2453
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:35,130
I mean,
I never felt like I could,

2454
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:37,590
I never felt like I could have a regular
job.

2455
01:47:37,591 --> 01:47:39,900
Like from the time I got out of high
school,

2456
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:44,250
I never had a full time job.
I had a bunch of part time jobs.

2457
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:47,250
I did some full time jobs where
construction companies and stuff,

2458
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:51,030
but I didn't last.
I would do them for like a month or a

2459
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:52,440
couple of weeks and I was like fuck
this,

2460
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:55,740
like whatever it is about.
And it was all,

2461
01:47:55,770 --> 01:48:00,770
it was the main source
of all my problems in high school.

2462
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:06,720
All my problems in high school was I was
not willing to do things I didn't want

2463
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:09,570
to do.
So I would barely get by through high

2464
01:48:09,571 --> 01:48:11,280
school.
I go take tests.

2465
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,970
They would register intelligence or
measure intelligence.

2466
01:48:14,971 --> 01:48:16,320
That'd be great.
Everything's fine.

2467
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:21,060
But I would take actual test based on
what I was supposed to be studying and I

2468
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:25,710
fucking barely paid attention.
I mean I s squoze through high school

2469
01:48:25,711 --> 01:48:29,160
with like a c average and most things I
barely got by.

2470
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,580
And even when I was going to college,
I was only going to college.

2471
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:35,970
I went to Boston University and uh,
or umass rather in Boston.

2472
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:39,780
And the only reason why I went is
because I didn't want anybody to think I

2473
01:48:39,781 --> 01:48:42,480
was a loser.
So I was taking classes at Umass and

2474
01:48:42,490 --> 01:48:43,323
busy.
It was a,

2475
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:46,290
when I was teaching taekwondo at Boston
University,

2476
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:50,580
which was like a,
a really good school and I was looking

2477
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:54,900
at all these people that were preparing
for life and to me it was like,

2478
01:48:54,901 --> 01:48:57,010
you're going to go eat,
get eaten by alligators or something.

2479
01:48:57,011 --> 01:48:58,080
And I was like,
what are you going to do?

2480
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:01,110
You're going to go get a job,
you're going to be working nine to five

2481
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,570
for whatever,
whatever fucked up thing that was wrong

2482
01:49:03,571 --> 01:49:06,150
in my head.
I would way rather get up in the morning

2483
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:09,840
and deliver newspapers for three hours a
day or drive limos at night.

2484
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:13,020
I,
I had a really unstable childhood.

2485
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:16,500
So in my mind,
anything that you were locked down to

2486
01:49:16,501 --> 01:49:17,460
was death.

2487
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:22,230
It was prison and I,
whatever malfunction of my brain,

2488
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:26,460
I figured out a way to make it work for
survival skill.

2489
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,410
Yeah.
In some way,

2490
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,160
but also a lack of like,
I'm not very disciplined.

2491
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:34,260
It looks like I'm disciplined on the
outside.

2492
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,330
I'm not disciplined at all.
I'm obsessed.

2493
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:40,110
I get obsessed with things whether I'm
disciplined with in certain aspects like

2494
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:42,450
with exercise and I do it when I don't
want to do it.

2495
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,090
I forced myself to practice and I forced
myself to write.

2496
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:47,980
I forced myself to do things,
but more of,

2497
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:53,020
it's more of an obsession thing.
Like I get obsessed with either a goals

2498
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:58,770
or tasks or things or puzzles or games.
I've have a real problem,

2499
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:01,270
like there's something wrong with me.

2500
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:02,790
Well,
why do you say that?

2501
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:03,770
Does it feel draining?

2502
01:50:04,050 --> 01:50:06,610
No,
because like I'll play pool for 12 hours

2503
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:07,990
in a row.
Like I'll,

2504
01:50:07,991 --> 01:50:10,510
I'll get obsessed with playing pool and
then I think I'm going to be the world

2505
01:50:10,511 --> 01:50:12,790
champion.
I'm going to practice 12 hours a day for

2506
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:14,130
the rest of my life.
I mean,

2507
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:18,070
I'm a sick person.
Like whatever happened to me when I was

2508
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:21,520
young,
like whatever weirdness in involved in

2509
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:23,350
wwe,
I figured out a way to manage it,

2510
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:26,110
but it can get away from me.
It's gotten away from me before.

2511
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:27,520
Well,
I played video games like eight,

2512
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:30,070
10 hours a day.
It can get away.

2513
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:33,280
I go,
I have to manage whatever craziness that

2514
01:50:33,281 --> 01:50:35,740
makes me like focus on things.
Yeah.

2515
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:38,980
I see it in my kids,
especially my middle daughter,

2516
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:41,500
she's,
she gets obsessed with things and I'm

2517
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:41,951
like,
wow,

2518
01:50:41,951 --> 01:50:43,870
this is crazy.
It's like a genetic thing.

2519
01:50:43,871 --> 01:50:46,570
It's like watching a little female,
me and a lot of ways,

2520
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,840
you know,
like she read all eight Harry Potter

2521
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:51,700
books and a matter of a couple of
months,

2522
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:55,110
she just,
she is just gets into stuff and then

2523
01:50:55,111 --> 01:50:55,871
like you got to go,
Hey,

2524
01:50:55,871 --> 01:50:56,530
shut the light out.

2525
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:57,910
You've got to go to bed one more
chapter.

2526
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,451
Like,
come on,

2527
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:00,460
you've got to stop it.
But,

2528
01:51:00,461 --> 01:51:02,650
um,
it's not like she's seen it in me and

2529
01:51:02,651 --> 01:51:06,400
she's mirroring it because it's her own
little weirdness,

2530
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:09,390
you know?
But I think it's obviously she's got a,

2531
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,380
uh,
a healthier environment than I grew up

2532
01:51:11,381 --> 01:51:12,640
in.
So it's not like a,

2533
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,470
a matter of luck not ever,
not ever wanting to be connected to

2534
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:19,120
anything permanent cause nothing is
permanent.

2535
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:22,150
I mean that was part of,
I think with the lessons from my

2536
01:51:22,151 --> 01:51:24,130
childhood,
like no one's here to help you.

2537
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:26,470
Not as a,
don't get locked in any fucking job.

2538
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:29,020
Don't get locked in any,
you get ready to move in any time,

2539
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:31,150
you know,
and embracing moving.

2540
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:33,020
Like to this day I'll be,
I'll be like,

2541
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:34,810
I've got to get the fuck on la.
You're like,

2542
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:35,470
everything's here.

2543
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:37,540
I have to do everything here.
The comic stores here,

2544
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:39,310
my family's here,
my kids go to school here.

2545
01:51:39,311 --> 01:51:40,750
All my friends live here.
But I'm like,

2546
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:41,920
fuck this,
I'm going to the mountains.

2547
01:51:41,950 --> 01:51:45,160
I gotta get Outta here.
Like I have this like no mad shit in me

2548
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:48,130
that I'm like constantly trying to,
um,

2549
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:50,500
to uh,
manage.

2550
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:54,370
So
as much as people like to take credit

2551
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,880
for a certain amount of success,
like I can tell you all the different

2552
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:00,760
things that I did that led to me being
successful at things,

2553
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:04,630
but almost,
it's like the function of a mental

2554
01:52:04,631 --> 01:52:06,220
issue,
like a big,

2555
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:11,400
a lot of it is a function of learning
how to manage a brain that doesn't work

2556
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:14,080
like everybody else's brain.

2557
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:20,890
That's so I think common for a lot of
successful people especially,

2558
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,940
and the differences,
you're aware of how it works and you've

2559
01:52:24,941 --> 01:52:27,100
learned how to manage it.
But that,

2560
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:31,030
you know,
that obsessive thing in so many ways it

2561
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:33,220
has made you,
it has gotten you a certain degree of

2562
01:52:33,221 --> 01:52:36,370
success and all of those things,
survival skills,

2563
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:38,350
compensatory strategies,
whatever they are,

2564
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,590
they have their positives,
they have ways that they really help us,

2565
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,830
but then they have the ways that kind of
torture us and a lot of ways.

2566
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:46,010
And I think

2567
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:49,970
growth is really about understanding
what are the ways that this isn't doing

2568
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:52,610
me any good and how can I be mindful of
it.

2569
01:52:52,611 --> 01:52:55,130
And also like,
you know,

2570
01:52:55,250 --> 01:53:00,250
how do I know now that like that now is
not then like how do I,

2571
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:03,950
you know,
stop being activated by old experiences

2572
01:53:03,951 --> 01:53:08,951
in my past and just have peace for where
I am now and take those gifts from the

2573
01:53:09,801 --> 01:53:13,280
obsession that's made you successful but
not having the parts that kind of

2574
01:53:13,281 --> 01:53:13,960
torture you at the same

2575
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,870
done.
Well,

2576
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:16,690
I don't feel tortured.
Um,

2577
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:20,830
so I think in some ways have achieved
some sort of a victory over my whatever

2578
01:53:20,831 --> 01:53:24,130
mental issues that I have,
but I can't do nothing.

2579
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:27,430
Right.
That's the reason why I have three jobs

2580
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,330
you don't have,
I can't do nothing if I do an end.

2581
01:53:31,331 --> 01:53:35,680
I have three jobs and a fucking ton of
obsessions outside of those jobs.

2582
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:40,460
Martial arts,
archery or reading and writing and all

2583
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:44,380
sorts of other stuff on top of
podcasting and doing the commentary for

2584
01:53:44,381 --> 01:53:45,980
the UFC,
doing standup comedy,

2585
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,850
like that's the only way I feel even.
Yeah,

2586
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:53,800
and I can't have one thing that I count
on either if like I had,

2587
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:57,160
if I only had standup comedy or only had
the UFC,

2588
01:53:57,161 --> 01:53:59,680
if there's only one thing or only had
podcasting,

2589
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,360
I'd be like,
this is my,

2590
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:03,250
I got it.
I would want to quit.

2591
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,630
I'm like,
I don't want to do this anymore.

2592
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:06,790
This is my fucking thing.
I'm just going to be trapped doing this

2593
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:09,160
thing,
talking into a fucking microphone out

2594
01:54:09,161 --> 01:54:11,920
into space for the rest of my life.
I've got to go to fucking,

2595
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,420
I don't even want to hear myself
anymore.

2596
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:14,660
I've got to quit.
No.

2597
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:18,340
So whatever weird malfunction my brains
had,

2598
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:22,280
I've figured out a way over all the
years of my life to,

2599
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:26,920
to manage it,
but a lot of his physical to managing my

2600
01:54:26,921 --> 01:54:30,640
brain.
A lot of it requires intense exercise.

2601
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:33,280
Like when I,
when I intensely exercise,

2602
01:54:33,281 --> 01:54:34,350
then I can like,
oh,

2603
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:36,770
all right.
It's going to be all right.

2604
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:38,410
It's going to be cool,
but if I don't,

2605
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:41,930
yeah.
It's like it's all built up and then

2606
01:54:41,931 --> 01:54:43,570
there's,
it's hard to enjoy things.

2607
01:54:43,571 --> 01:54:45,520
Yeah.
It's hard to just chill.

2608
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:49,030
Like I can't chill unless I earn it.
It gets a,

2609
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:54,670
it's probably a malfunction,
but it's the illusion is that it's not,

2610
01:54:54,671 --> 01:54:57,160
the illusion is that it's a discipline
and then it's all,

2611
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:00,070
it's all choices,
but that's really not the case.

2612
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:04,370
Maybe it's just you and how you operate
your operating system.

2613
01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:06,410
Are You coaching me now?
Is that what's going on here?

2614
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:09,560
Does that feel like I am?

2615
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,550
Yeah.
Maybe it is me.

2616
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:15,050
I mean,
I think people,

2617
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:16,770
and that's not a bad thing.
That's,

2618
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:18,240
you know,
I think that there,

2619
01:55:18,241 --> 01:55:22,440
I back to the acceptance thing.
There's a lot of ways I think we're

2620
01:55:22,441 --> 01:55:26,130
supposed to be and we look at other
people and how they do their life for

2621
01:55:26,131 --> 01:55:28,140
whatever.
And we think that because we're acting

2622
01:55:28,141 --> 01:55:29,730
this way,
something must be wrong with us,

2623
01:55:29,731 --> 01:55:33,570
but a lot of times there's not.
This is just the way you operate.

2624
01:55:33,730 --> 01:55:35,770
Yeah.
You know what another thing is

2625
01:55:35,771 --> 01:55:37,470
interesting is,
um,

2626
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:42,720
when I was a kid I was a not very
confident and also didn't like to talk

2627
01:55:43,201 --> 01:55:44,910
to people,
get anxiety,

2628
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,090
I anxiety.
If I had a talk and I get anxiety,

2629
01:55:48,091 --> 01:55:50,380
if I had to like talk to a bank teller,
I go,

2630
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,810
I had to wait in line through the
backdoor.

2631
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:54,840
I'd start freaking out like on my way to
the bank teller.

2632
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:59,100
And like if you talked to like people
who knew me from high school and they'll

2633
01:55:59,101 --> 01:56:00,000
go,
uh,

2634
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:02,280
did you ever think that Joe is going to
be a comedian?

2635
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:04,020
They'd be like,
no,

2636
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:06,240
like no fucking way.
That guy was at funny,

2637
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:11,070
like they didn't,
I figured out a way to be more relaxed

2638
01:56:11,071 --> 01:56:14,100
socially and it wasn't an easy process
at all.

2639
01:56:14,101 --> 01:56:18,600
It took forever to the point where now
I'm extremely relaxed socially.

2640
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,520
Like now I can talk to anybody.
Like I,

2641
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:23,190
I love one of the things I love about
doing podcasts.

2642
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:25,350
I like just having conversations with
people.

2643
01:56:25,351 --> 01:56:28,110
Yeah.
I want to know like you're another

2644
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:29,670
organism.
You're another person.

2645
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:30,990
I want to know what's going on in your
head.

2646
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:33,480
I don't understand your life.
I want to,

2647
01:56:33,481 --> 01:56:37,050
I want to own to try to see what
connections you've made,

2648
01:56:37,051 --> 01:56:39,990
what,
what definitions you've fallen on.

2649
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:41,340
You know,
what you know,

2650
01:56:41,341 --> 01:56:43,650
how you've defined this world,
how you've,

2651
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,800
how you've categorized things and how
you're managing it.

2652
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:48,360
How are you,
how are you maneuvering through it?

2653
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:51,780
I'm fascinated by that.
I'm fascinated by the,

2654
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:55,110
the,
the thoughts that people carry around

2655
01:56:55,111 --> 01:56:56,340
inside their heads.
Yeah,

2656
01:56:56,670 --> 01:56:58,110
me too.
Yeah.

2657
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:00,630
I love it.
And whether or not they're empowering or

2658
01:57:00,631 --> 01:57:03,210
whether or not you're a woe is me type
person,

2659
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,460
you know?

2660
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:07,610
And what are the puzzle pieces that have
led to where you are?

2661
01:57:07,611 --> 01:57:10,490
And I love that you're sharing this
because I think a lot of people can see

2662
01:57:10,491 --> 01:57:15,020
you and see your success in everything
that you have and thank you were always

2663
01:57:15,021 --> 01:57:17,480
like this and then it's just been easy
cause it's this,

2664
01:57:17,481 --> 01:57:18,470
you know,
you're always like this,

2665
01:57:18,471 --> 01:57:22,400
but to know you had that background and
you had the social anxiety and this is

2666
01:57:22,401 --> 01:57:26,720
like such a stretch,
I think it's really inspiring because it

2667
01:57:26,721 --> 01:57:28,010
gives people,
it's like,

2668
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,000
oh you,
you can't,

2669
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:33,320
you can no longer argue that you know,
you're just born a certain way and

2670
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:37,880
that's just the way you are.
Like your proof that you actually can

2671
01:57:37,881 --> 01:57:41,630
change and you can't get over things and
you can create things that you know you

2672
01:57:41,631 --> 01:57:44,810
probably didn't think were possible when
you were 10 or however old you were when

2673
01:57:44,811 --> 01:57:45,920
you were going through all that stuff.

2674
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,950
Yeah.
I think there are,

2675
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,810
people have different starting points.
Yeah.

2676
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:54,090
It's like I was saying that if you want
to climb Mount Everest,

2677
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:55,920
good luck of,
you're starting from Santa Monica.

2678
01:57:55,921 --> 01:57:57,840
You got to fucking walk all the way to
Tibet.

2679
01:57:58,150 --> 01:57:59,950
It's going to take a long ass time.
There's,

2680
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:01,130
the ocean is going to be hard to get a
grip,

2681
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,470
but if you're at the base of Tibet,
if that's where you live,

2682
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:09,500
it's w or the base of the Himalayas,
it's way easier to climb that thing,

2683
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:11,190
you know,
it's still not easy,

2684
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:14,280
but it's easier.
And I think there's a lot of people that

2685
01:58:14,281 --> 01:58:15,300
start,
you know,

2686
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:19,410
in the a metaphoric Santa Monica would
their life,

2687
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,660
they're really far away from their goal.
Yeah.

2688
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,660
It doesn't mean it's not possible,
but it means that there's a bunch of

2689
01:58:24,661 --> 01:58:26,670
steps,
whether they're conscious or unconscious

2690
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,940
that you're going to have to make in
order to get to a position.

2691
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:33,900
And I still remember fucking freaking
out going to a bank teller.

2692
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:37,170
I think we used to have an all the time,
I just didn't want to talk to people.

2693
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:42,440
I was just in my own head and I was
super insecure and I just could barely

2694
01:58:42,671 --> 01:58:44,230
get through shit,
you know?

2695
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:46,690
And so what changed it?
Just doing it over and over again.

2696
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:50,680
Martial arts was a big thing.
The martial arts is the first thing that

2697
01:58:50,681 --> 01:58:54,670
I ever did where I was good at it or I
didn't feel like a loser.

2698
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:58,210
It was like I had done,
I was pretty good at art and uh,

2699
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,120
yes.
Yeah.

2700
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:03,220
And um,
I wanted to be a comic book illustrator

2701
01:59:03,221 --> 01:59:06,010
and that was like a big focus in my life
when I was younger.

2702
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,450
But,
um,

2703
01:59:07,451 --> 01:59:09,820
I mean,
and I and I definitely took some sort of

2704
01:59:09,821 --> 01:59:13,090
identity in the fact that I was good at
that and I liked the fact that people

2705
01:59:13,091 --> 01:59:15,430
would say I was good at it and made me
feel good.

2706
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,080
But it was different than martial arts
because with martial arts,

2707
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:23,050
um,
it was the first thing that I did where

2708
01:59:23,051 --> 01:59:27,490
I felt like I could really be
exceptional I think could be really

2709
01:59:27,491 --> 01:59:30,130
good,
like in an are realize that,

2710
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:34,750
um,
first of all I was gifted physically and

2711
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:39,700
then also this crazy brain of mine.
If I could point it to something,

2712
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:42,700
like I would work out at three o'clock
in the morning cause I knew nobody else

2713
01:59:42,701 --> 01:59:44,440
would.
I knew they weren't there.

2714
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:47,410
So I had keys to the gym,
so a,

2715
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:49,750
because I was teaching,
so I would go there,

2716
01:59:49,751 --> 01:59:54,751
I'd wake up and I would drive down to
the gym and I open it up in the middle

2717
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:58,510
of the night and put in a workout
because I knew that no one else was

2718
01:59:58,511 --> 02:00:01,210
doing that.
I knew they weren't there and I knew,

2719
02:00:01,211 --> 02:00:04,000
I felt like it gave me an this,
well yeah,

2720
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:04,390
an edge.

2721
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:06,820
But it also,
I felt like there was,

2722
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,190
I was getting ahead of them,
you know,

2723
02:00:09,191 --> 02:00:09,791
like,
like it was,

2724
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:14,791
it was some sort of a crazy race.
So for between the age of 15 and 21 I

2725
02:00:16,451 --> 02:00:20,020
was just completely obsessed with
fighting and that's all I did.

2726
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:21,243
I just,
I didn't,

2727
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:24,190
I didn't know.
I probably barely knew who was

2728
02:00:24,191 --> 02:00:26,980
president.
I didn't know a goddamn thing about the

2729
02:00:26,981 --> 02:00:30,130
world.
I wasn't reading shit unless it was like

2730
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:33,340
some Samurai book on philosophy in
combat.

2731
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:37,540
Like that was all I was obsessed with
and that's when I was also a got an a

2732
02:00:37,541 --> 02:00:39,460
and they were ah,
anthony robins and somewhere around that

2733
02:00:39,461 --> 02:00:42,430
too.
But I was interested in like things that

2734
02:00:42,431 --> 02:00:45,250
would give me an edge,
personal development stuff that would

2735
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:47,950
give me an edge.
And then through doing martial arts and

2736
02:00:47,951 --> 02:00:50,470
then also through teaching,
I think that was a big one,

2737
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:52,060
was teaching classes.

2738
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:56,170
And then teaching at Bu was big too.
Cause when I was teaching at Boston

2739
02:00:56,170 --> 02:00:57,550
University,
I was teaching an actual class

2740
02:00:58,230 --> 02:01:00,100
taekwondo.
When I was,

2741
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:04,490
at that time I was a,
I'd won the u open,

2742
02:01:04,491 --> 02:01:07,210
I had won a bunch of different
tournaments and I was,

2743
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:08,530
you know,
it was,

2744
02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:10,930
I was doing really well as a,
as a fighter,

2745
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:13,300
as a martial arts competitor.
So,

2746
02:01:13,301 --> 02:01:14,160
um,
they had,

2747
02:01:14,161 --> 02:01:15,970
uh,
a taekwondo program at Bu and I was

2748
02:01:15,971 --> 02:01:19,720
teaching it and I would have to address
a whole class,

2749
02:01:19,721 --> 02:01:22,090
but I would address a whole class as
something that was really good at,

2750
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:25,180
like I knew I could demonstrate them to
them,

2751
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,490
some movements and stuff like that.
It shows some things.

2752
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:30,730
I'd asked someone to hold something and
I'd kick it or something like that and

2753
02:01:30,731 --> 02:01:31,870
they'd be like,
Holy Shit.

2754
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:33,910
And then they would listen.
Like I could get,

2755
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:36,790
I could,
I was confident in what I was saying

2756
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:40,310
there and it was like the only time in
my life that I can remember being

2757
02:01:40,311 --> 02:01:42,800
confident and telling people something.

2758
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:45,110
Yeah.
It's like I would describe how you do

2759
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:46,850
it.
This is how you do it and I'll show you

2760
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:49,340
how to do it here,
but this is how it needs to be done and

2761
02:01:49,341 --> 02:01:51,320
this is why.
And this is what happens when you do it

2762
02:01:51,321 --> 02:01:54,170
and this is what involved in the
mechanisms of your body and,

2763
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,190
and so that,
that gave me the first,

2764
02:01:58,191 --> 02:02:00,320
that was like the first feeling that I
got were,

2765
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,310
um,
there was,

2766
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:03,140
I,
I knew that there was like a light at

2767
02:02:03,141 --> 02:02:04,670
the end of the tunnel,
or at least I knew,

2768
02:02:04,671 --> 02:02:07,130
well,
at least this now I don't feel like a

2769
02:02:07,131 --> 02:02:08,120
loser anymore.
Yeah,

2770
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:10,060
yeah,
yeah.

2771
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:12,670
It gave you something to like,
like you said,

2772
02:02:12,671 --> 02:02:16,240
be exceptional at yeah.
And I think that's what gives us

2773
02:02:16,241 --> 02:02:20,560
confidence is feeling like we've
somewhat mastered something like

2774
02:02:20,561 --> 02:02:24,850
somewhat really could understand
something well enough to teach it.

2775
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,230
Yes.
Yeah.

2776
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:28,210
Without that,
we're just chasing it.

2777
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:32,680
I think for and trying to get it through
little things we do.

2778
02:02:32,681 --> 02:02:35,080
And I think that's why a lot of people
like go from career to career,

2779
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:37,240
job to job or whatever.
Trying to find that little bit of

2780
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:40,600
instead of sticking with something and
like really focusing in on really

2781
02:02:40,601 --> 02:02:42,400
studying it.
And that's where I think the obsession

2782
02:02:42,401 --> 02:02:44,320
actually served you in a lot of ways.

2783
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:46,810
I think for sure.
And there's also expression than I,

2784
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:50,330
I love to use the martial arts are a
vehicle for developing your human

2785
02:02:50,331 --> 02:02:53,030
potential.
Cause cause it's so difficult and it's

2786
02:02:53,031 --> 02:02:56,480
so terrifying.
And then the idea of competing and yeah,

2787
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:59,900
in the physical consequences are so
devastating.

2788
02:02:59,901 --> 02:03:03,050
If you get hit that you are,
you can't,

2789
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:05,930
you can't have acid,
you can't slack off,

2790
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,240
you have to,
you have to really pursue this thing

2791
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:10,880
with an insanity,
like a,

2792
02:03:10,881 --> 02:03:13,430
an incredible intensity.
And then through that you realize like,

2793
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:14,610
oh I could do that.
Yeah.

2794
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:17,090
And then from doing that you kind of
realize,

2795
02:03:17,091 --> 02:03:22,091
well what if I apply that to writing a
book or doing that or learning how to do

2796
02:03:22,641 --> 02:03:24,590
something else.
Or for me it was standup comedy.

2797
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,850
Wow.
That see,

2798
02:03:26,020 --> 02:03:29,910
stand up comedy seems terrifying to me.
Sarah.

2799
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:30,280
Nice.

2800
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:34,870
Terrifying is working in a fucking
office wearing tassels with shiny shoes.

2801
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:37,980
That's very true.
Stupid socks.

2802
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:41,080
Yeah.
That was terrifying for me to,

2803
02:03:41,081 --> 02:03:43,300
Oh God.
I remember like Sunday nights I would

2804
02:03:43,301 --> 02:03:45,850
just get knots in my stomach.
Just like,

2805
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:50,170
Oh,
do I have to go and be an awful staff

2806
02:03:50,171 --> 02:03:52,740
meetings on Monday mornings?
Like

2807
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,020
sucking the oxygen out of your own life
out.

2808
02:03:57,570 --> 02:04:00,670
Yeah.
That's why a lot of people start taking

2809
02:04:00,671 --> 02:04:01,870
medication.
Yup.

2810
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:03,180
Yup.

2811
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:07,710
That unhappiness of just what you call
quote unquote real life.

2812
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:12,870
There's been a structure that's put in
place that we've all sort of shuffled

2813
02:04:12,871 --> 02:04:17,000
into that doesn't serve us and it
doesn't serve most people.

2814
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:19,050
You'll have wim Hoff on last night,
you know,

2815
02:04:19,051 --> 02:04:22,200
he is a [inaudible] about him.
He's amazing.

2816
02:04:22,350 --> 02:04:23,810
But one of the things he and I were
talking about,

2817
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:25,410
he was,
he gave me his number about,

2818
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:28,020
what did he say?
Like 7% of people or something like

2819
02:04:28,021 --> 02:04:29,630
that,
do things that are creative with their,

2820
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:33,510
their life.
What 7% 70% of the world.

2821
02:04:33,511 --> 02:04:34,344
I don't know.
Oh,

2822
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:38,170
let's,
let's get crazy and say it's 15% that's

2823
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:39,390
really small.
It is.

2824
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:40,260
Well,
here's the thing.

2825
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:43,020
100% of kids are creative.
It's true.

2826
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:45,030
Like my kids,
they're both,

2827
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,160
they're both always do.
My young kids,

2828
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:50,850
they're both always painting or drawing
or doing something in.

2829
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:55,851
My older kid does music,
so this is like so much creativity that

2830
02:04:56,251 --> 02:05:00,780
they,
they feel drawn to it and all that stuff

2831
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,890
is something that every kid does.
Yup.

2832
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:05,730
Every kid draws shit.
Every kid plays with clay.

2833
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:09,780
Every kid make stuff with legos.
You all like put things together,

2834
02:05:09,781 --> 02:05:12,450
remind,
but somewhere along the line we're

2835
02:05:12,451 --> 02:05:15,390
stuffed into this structure that doesn't
serve us.

2836
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:18,970
And if we feel like we have to do it
because we've given,

2837
02:05:19,110 --> 02:05:23,700
been shuffled through school and into
college and then we're in debt and then

2838
02:05:23,701 --> 02:05:27,690
we have to take opportunities and these
opportunities is a good opportunity.

2839
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:28,800
You know?
It's a good,

2840
02:05:28,801 --> 02:05:30,000
good career.
Yep.

2841
02:05:30,730 --> 02:05:32,470
It's horrific.
It is an end.

2842
02:05:32,471 --> 02:05:34,360
Like to go back to what you were saying
earlier,

2843
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:37,720
like these,
these systems that we've built are so

2844
02:05:37,721 --> 02:05:42,721
antiquated and so outdated from politics
to the school system and it all needs to

2845
02:05:44,261 --> 02:05:46,880
change and we're seeing it start to,
you know,

2846
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,660
or seen it start to,
I think that the way we educate kids,

2847
02:05:49,661 --> 02:05:52,420
the way we relate to add and all these
things,

2848
02:05:52,421 --> 02:05:56,920
I think so much of Atdd is like the
current system and the way kids are like

2849
02:05:56,950 --> 02:06:01,630
can find in this classroom and I have to
follow these rules and sit still all

2850
02:06:01,630 --> 02:06:02,640
day.
Like it,

2851
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:04,960
there's no nurturing of creativity.
Right.

2852
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:08,290
Um,
so I think over time a lot of this is

2853
02:06:08,291 --> 02:06:12,180
going to start to change.
I hope so because we just can't squat.

2854
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:12,971
I see this,
you know,

2855
02:06:12,971 --> 02:06:15,520
with kids all that,
I have three nephews and I see the same

2856
02:06:15,521 --> 02:06:15,820
thing.

2857
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:17,950
They're so creative and there's,
they're confident.

2858
02:06:17,951 --> 02:06:19,600
They don't care what other people think
of them.

2859
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:21,370
You know,
they don't have a lot of fear.

2860
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:23,740
They,
and when they do do something creative,

2861
02:06:23,741 --> 02:06:24,880
they don't judge it and go,
oh,

2862
02:06:24,881 --> 02:06:28,480
is it good?
Like they just enjoy the process and

2863
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:31,840
that starts to phase out as we get older
and we get obsessed with other people

2864
02:06:31,841 --> 02:06:34,090
thinking,
is it good enough and is this safe and

2865
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:37,870
well this please my parents and like
will I be able to make money this way

2866
02:06:37,871 --> 02:06:42,460
and we just get so disconnected from
that childlike creativity and

2867
02:06:42,461 --> 02:06:46,330
wonderment,
curiosity and and kind of no fear and

2868
02:06:46,331 --> 02:06:50,560
faith in ourselves that we just get
stuck in this kind of checklist,

2869
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:52,420
tassel wearing life.

2870
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:55,000
I think it's another tassels,
tassels,

2871
02:06:55,001 --> 02:06:58,210
our enemy.
I think there's another thing that we

2872
02:06:58,211 --> 02:07:00,520
need to consider and this is really
important to people that are like,

2873
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:02,290
well this is bullshit,
dreamer talk,

2874
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:06,670
listen to this because this is real.
That corporate worlds only been around

2875
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:11,970
for less than a hundred years.
This is a new thing in modern life and

2876
02:07:12,401 --> 02:07:15,850
modern life is new in terms of the
length of time.

2877
02:07:15,851 --> 02:07:20,080
Human beings have been alive.
This is a new thing and it doesn't serve

2878
02:07:20,081 --> 02:07:25,081
us,
and maybe with technological innovation

2879
02:07:25,511 --> 02:07:28,750
and robots and automation and all the
different shit that's coming down the

2880
02:07:28,751 --> 02:07:30,580
line,
maybe there'll be less and less

2881
02:07:30,581 --> 02:07:33,160
opportunities for you to work a slave
job and you'll have to do something

2882
02:07:33,161 --> 02:07:35,290
creative.
It will be more and more compelling,

2883
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:40,950
but this world that we've structured
that doesn't serve us is incredibly

2884
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:44,710
recent and it's not,
it's not rigid.

2885
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,580
Like you don't have to do it.
Right,

2886
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,450
right.
But it seems like you do,

2887
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:51,370
it seems like you do.
What's actually really cool about

2888
02:07:51,371 --> 02:07:52,780
millennials,
you know this,

2889
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:57,430
the generation that's now like 20 to 35
36 ish,

2890
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:00,970
that's one of the things I talk about is
generational diversity in millennials

2891
02:08:00,971 --> 02:08:05,020
and they're demanding a different kind
of workplace.

2892
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:08,890
They're more likely to take a job where
they have more creativity.

2893
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:13,270
The culture is like less cubical base.
They have more freedom than a job with

2894
02:08:13,271 --> 02:08:17,950
like the salary and the benefits and
they're not relating to work in the same

2895
02:08:17,951 --> 02:08:19,420
way.
They're really questioning the old

2896
02:08:19,421 --> 02:08:22,570
paradigms there.
And I don't understand like why do I

2897
02:08:22,571 --> 02:08:25,330
have to be there from nine to five if I
can like get this done at home,

2898
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:27,790
you know,
a certain amount of time and a lot more

2899
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:30,040
of them are starting their own
businesses and doing the more

2900
02:08:30,041 --> 02:08:33,490
traditional path.
So I think we're already starting to see

2901
02:08:33,491 --> 02:08:37,000
it change because we have a generation
that's huge.

2902
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:40,480
I mean the millennial generation is
ginormous and they're,

2903
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:41,980
they,
they're demanding different things from

2904
02:08:41,981 --> 02:08:43,870
work and making different choices
already.

2905
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:45,550
So it's already shifting.
Sorry,

2906
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:46,040
shifting.

2907
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:47,750
Yeah.
I also think another thing that's

2908
02:08:47,751 --> 02:08:51,920
bullshit is the amount of time that's
required to make a living just to

2909
02:08:51,921 --> 02:08:53,360
survive.
I mean,

2910
02:08:53,420 --> 02:08:58,420
how many people are barely being able to
feed themselves and housed themselves

2911
02:08:58,790 --> 02:09:02,390
and they're giving up their entire day
and their entire week.

2912
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:04,250
And you get,
if you're lucky,

2913
02:09:04,251 --> 02:09:06,350
you get that Saturday,
Sunday off,

2914
02:09:06,351 --> 02:09:08,090
but most of the time on Saturday and
Sunday,

2915
02:09:08,091 --> 02:09:11,150
if you have an an office job,
you have some shit that you brought home

2916
02:09:11,151 --> 02:09:12,590
with you that you have to sort through.

2917
02:09:13,310 --> 02:09:17,090
Yeah.
That it's the whole payment systems.

2918
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:22,120
Crazy and you see like these instead of
celebrities making all this money just

2919
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:27,320
by posting pictures and you've got
somebody going into a job like nine to

2920
02:09:27,321 --> 02:09:29,690
five day after day after day,
barely scraping by.

2921
02:09:29,691 --> 02:09:31,250
It's just,
I don't know.

2922
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:33,710
Well,
what freaks me out is people that just

2923
02:09:33,711 --> 02:09:38,390
move money around and they make billions
like think about like hedge fund people

2924
02:09:38,391 --> 02:09:39,620
and people that like,
what are you doing?

2925
02:09:39,621 --> 02:09:43,550
You're moving numbers around and you're
making numbers and the pro how much,

2926
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:47,330
how much are you extracting while you're
moving stuff around?

2927
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:51,020
It's the,
like I had this conversation with this

2928
02:09:51,021 --> 02:09:53,930
woman who was like the staunch
Republican who was telling me that the

2929
02:09:53,931 --> 02:09:58,250
minimum wage was so ridiculous.
She was so adamant that you can't raise

2930
02:09:58,251 --> 02:09:59,570
the minimum wage.
I'm like,

2931
02:09:59,571 --> 02:10:00,860
why not?
And she's like,

2932
02:10:00,861 --> 02:10:03,890
was cause $15 an hour.
It would crush businesses and we'll do

2933
02:10:03,891 --> 02:10:04,581
this.
We'll do that.

2934
02:10:04,581 --> 02:10:05,690
I'm like,
well,

2935
02:10:05,691 --> 02:10:08,210
other people disagree.
Like you don't know whether or not that

2936
02:10:08,211 --> 02:10:08,691
is.
I go,

2937
02:10:08,691 --> 02:10:11,240
do you want to work for less than 15
bucks an hour?

2938
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,051
She's like,
well,

2939
02:10:12,051 --> 02:10:13,970
these are entry level jobs and this,
and none of them go,

2940
02:10:13,971 --> 02:10:16,850
well,
you're still requiring an hour of

2941
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:19,780
someone's time if your job,
if you have,

2942
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:24,260
if you have a business and your business
can't pay someone $15 for an hour of

2943
02:10:24,261 --> 02:10:26,330
their time,
your business is bullshit.

2944
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:30,440
It's bullshit.
Or you have too many employees or you,

2945
02:10:30,441 --> 02:10:31,274
you know,
you're not,

2946
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:35,420
it's not set up right,
but you're the person who's at the

2947
02:10:35,421 --> 02:10:38,210
lowest rung of the food chain to take
the hit,

2948
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:41,030
not the business.
Like if you have a business,

2949
02:10:41,031 --> 02:10:44,660
you came at pay someone $15 for a whole
hour of working,

2950
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:47,090
how much money are you generating and
why do you need all this business?

2951
02:10:47,091 --> 02:10:49,210
And why don't you know those employees
do it yourself?

2952
02:10:49,410 --> 02:10:53,060
It's not an efficient business.
And I wonder what's going to happen with

2953
02:10:53,061 --> 02:10:54,890
automation and with,
you know,

2954
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:58,250
they're,
they're talking about like a tremendous

2955
02:10:58,251 --> 02:11:02,000
amount of jobs that are being done right
now by people that are going to be done

2956
02:11:02,001 --> 02:11:03,590
by robots.
And it's,

2957
02:11:03,591 --> 02:11:04,970
it's just a matter of time.

2958
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:07,740
Yeah.
So it's even more important to nurture

2959
02:11:07,741 --> 02:11:12,150
your creativity and know what you can do
besides rely on the man or the

2960
02:11:12,151 --> 02:11:15,540
corporation or whatever it is.
Cause I think a lot of people think that

2961
02:11:15,541 --> 02:11:19,800
safety and economic security is in that
is in working for someone else course

2962
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:21,450
and working for

2963
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:24,700
bration getting a good job,
climbing the ladder,

2964
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:29,170
shooting your brains out,
jumping off a building.

2965
02:11:30,070 --> 02:11:31,320
Yeah.
This,

2966
02:11:31,330 --> 02:11:32,950
this,
we don't have that much time.

2967
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:34,360
This is,
this is not,

2968
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:37,360
this is not a long run.
It's really not.

2969
02:11:37,361 --> 02:11:41,050
It goes by really some 49 and I feel
like it was 20 yesterday.

2970
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:41,933
Yeah.
It just,

2971
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:43,480
it just happens.
Yeah.

2972
02:11:43,570 --> 02:11:46,540
And next thing you know,
I'll be 59 and next thing you know I'll

2973
02:11:46,541 --> 02:11:48,460
be 69 yeah.
You know,

2974
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:51,950
and then I'll be able to close my eyes
and hear the yawning grave.

2975
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:54,580
It's coming.
It's coming for all of us.

2976
02:11:54,970 --> 02:11:56,500
Yep.
You gotta have fun.

2977
02:11:56,710 --> 02:11:59,710
Gotta have fun while you're here.
If in any way possible.

2978
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:03,070
I agree.
I always say that I think regret is far

2979
02:12:03,071 --> 02:12:05,770
worse than risk.
Like I,

2980
02:12:06,070 --> 02:12:11,070
I'd rather take risks in my life then
regret it safe or staying in situations

2981
02:12:12,911 --> 02:12:16,510
that I knew weren't,
you know,

2982
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:17,800
for me,
I mean it,

2983
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:19,720
it's scary.
Yeah.

2984
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:23,320
And there's no guarantee,
but at least you do it.

2985
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:24,790
That's where she comes from.
No.

2986
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:25,653
Yeah,
exactly.

2987
02:12:26,290 --> 02:12:27,790
That's scary stuff.
Like Ugh,

2988
02:12:27,850 --> 02:12:30,400
that's what forces you to move.
And that's what gets things done.

2989
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:33,910
Exactly.
Every two years I throw away my act and

2990
02:12:33,911 --> 02:12:35,890
I write a new one.
I do a special,

2991
02:12:35,891 --> 02:12:38,680
like my netflix special,
I abandoned all those jokes and I have

2992
02:12:38,681 --> 02:12:39,910
to write a whole new one.
Okay.

2993
02:12:39,911 --> 02:12:43,210
That's fucking terrifying.
It's the worst.

2994
02:12:43,690 --> 02:12:46,360
But I keep doing it and every time I do
it,

2995
02:12:46,361 --> 02:12:49,120
it gets better.
If I keep doing it and I keep focusing

2996
02:12:49,121 --> 02:12:49,750
on it,
I'm on.

2997
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:52,270
And all that terror and fear of taking
that chance,

2998
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:55,150
it makes,
makes me get better at it.

2999
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:58,630
And that's a pretty minor thing cause
it's not like that much financial

3000
02:12:58,631 --> 02:13:02,950
concern and I'll be okay.
But for someone to take a chance

3001
02:13:03,130 --> 02:13:06,040
financially and take a chance,
their future and they don't really know

3002
02:13:06,041 --> 02:13:08,140
what,
what the future holds is not like they

3003
02:13:08,141 --> 02:13:12,310
have all these things to fall back on.
That's when you fucking dig in.

3004
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:14,860
That's when you make things happen.
Yeah.

3005
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:16,510
And if you don't,
you just,

3006
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:17,430
you just,
you,

3007
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,690
you just stay soft and lazy.

3008
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:20,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

3009
02:13:20,681 --> 02:13:24,970
Then and you never really discover your
true potential if you just stay

3010
02:13:25,570 --> 02:13:26,403
comfortable.

3011
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:28,790
Christina's people out there right now
that are listening,

3012
02:13:29,150 --> 02:13:31,410
that are getting fired up there.
Listen this right now they're jogging in

3013
02:13:31,411 --> 02:13:33,480
place and I'm like,
God dammit.

3014
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:35,160
I want to listen to Christine.

3015
02:13:35,790 --> 02:13:38,240
Take a chance.
It's good,

3016
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:38,911
right?
Yeah.

3017
02:13:38,911 --> 02:13:40,770
It's really good.
It's really good.

3018
02:13:40,830 --> 02:13:42,690
But don't just like here's this broke
the lighter.

3019
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:46,920
Can you really end it?
But don't just like feel motivated.

3020
02:13:46,921 --> 02:13:51,330
Like actually like commit to one thing.
You know,

3021
02:13:51,331 --> 02:13:54,690
what's one thing you can do to start
shifting your life?

3022
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:56,730
Is it,
like I said,

3023
02:13:56,731 --> 02:13:59,250
finding that hobby?
Is it like having a conversation with

3024
02:13:59,251 --> 02:14:01,020
your boss?
Is it going after that creative

3025
02:14:01,021 --> 02:14:02,820
endeavor?
Like just start,

3026
02:14:02,821 --> 02:14:06,690
that's the other thing.
Like people think they have to know all

3027
02:14:06,691 --> 02:14:08,910
the steps.
It's like I want to get to the second

3028
02:14:08,911 --> 02:14:11,520
floor.
I'm at the bottom of a staircase and

3029
02:14:11,521 --> 02:14:13,680
like I think I just have to jump to get
there.

3030
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:15,690
No,
like you go step by step by step,

3031
02:14:15,691 --> 02:14:19,590
just like you'd walk up the staircase so
you don't have to know it all at once.

3032
02:14:19,591 --> 02:14:22,080
It's just taking that first step and
then that leads to another and that

3033
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:22,560
leads to another.

3034
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,690
And like you said,
like it's the scary moments where you

3035
02:14:24,691 --> 02:14:28,020
find your grit and you find your
potential and you find out how you

3036
02:14:28,021 --> 02:14:32,040
respond to adversity and you find your
true gifts and you can only do that in

3037
02:14:32,041 --> 02:14:33,510
uncertainty.
And when you're uncomfortable,

3038
02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:36,990
maybe she'd be a clarity adviser.
The clarity advisor,

3039
02:14:36,991 --> 02:14:38,380
like some kind of psychic.
No,

3040
02:14:38,381 --> 02:14:38,641
no,
no.

3041
02:14:38,641 --> 02:14:39,840
Clarity.
Clarity.

3042
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:42,440
Yeah.
Psyche wouldn't be a Clara.

3043
02:14:42,610 --> 02:14:44,070
I knew charm.
This is my new.

3044
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:44,911
Oh,
Gotcha,

3045
02:14:44,911 --> 02:14:46,890
Gotcha.
I cleared the advisor.

3046
02:14:46,891 --> 02:14:48,420
That's good.
I like that.

3047
02:14:48,450 --> 02:14:49,920
It's a little wordy.
Yeah,

3048
02:14:49,921 --> 02:14:51,180
it's not perfect.
It's,

3049
02:14:51,181 --> 02:14:53,930
we're getting closer.
It's a step dad.

3050
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:56,550
There's something there.
Bright like you're,

3051
02:14:57,090 --> 02:14:58,590
you don't,
one thing that I tell people that I

3052
02:14:58,591 --> 02:15:02,400
think is really important,
it's helped me a lot is write the things

3053
02:15:02,401 --> 02:15:05,490
down that you need to do.
Make a list.

3054
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,350
Yup.
As far as your day,

3055
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:12,120
like the best way to get shit done is to
stare that Goddamn list and say,

3056
02:15:12,121 --> 02:15:13,680
all right today,
did I work out?

3057
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:15,270
Did I write,
did I do this?

3058
02:15:15,271 --> 02:15:17,070
Did I do that?
That would take care of that stuff.

3059
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:18,840
Right.
All that stuff that you need to do,

3060
02:15:18,841 --> 02:15:21,900
do it at the beginning of the day or
doing it when you go to bed at night,

3061
02:15:21,901 --> 02:15:24,570
sometimes even better before you go to
bed at night.

3062
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:26,320
Set your intention for the next day.
Say,

3063
02:15:26,321 --> 02:15:27,930
I'm going to get all this shit done.
Right.

3064
02:15:27,931 --> 02:15:30,120
I'll give yourself 1520 minutes.
You have it.

3065
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:31,720
Yeah.
Everybody's got 15 minutes.

3066
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:32,850
Everybody does.
Yeah.

3067
02:15:33,030 --> 02:15:35,010
And then write it down,
put it,

3068
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:38,400
put it on a piece of paper and then the
next day check that shit off.

3069
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:39,660
Yeah.
Do those things.

3070
02:15:39,930 --> 02:15:42,120
And if you could just get in the habit
of doing that.

3071
02:15:42,121 --> 02:15:45,360
It's so easy to avoid cause people love
to just be lazy.

3072
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:48,380
These they love the distraction of doing
nothing

3073
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:49,470
insane.
They don't have time.

3074
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:51,640
Yes.
And saying they don't have time but,

3075
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:56,430
but that is one that has been incredibly
beneficial to me is writing things down,

3076
02:15:56,470 --> 02:16:00,490
making a list and forcing myself to
check all the shit off that's on that

3077
02:16:00,491 --> 02:16:00,820
list.

3078
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:02,080
Yeah.
And doing the things you don't always

3079
02:16:02,081 --> 02:16:05,200
feel like doing and and also being
accountable that people like having

3080
02:16:05,201 --> 02:16:07,000
somebody that's like calling you and be
like,

3081
02:16:07,001 --> 02:16:08,740
did you do it?
Like did you do it?

3082
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:11,170
Did you show up for yourself?
Because it takes momentum,

3083
02:16:11,650 --> 02:16:13,810
you know,
like making these kinds of changes.

3084
02:16:13,811 --> 02:16:17,140
You have to build momentum.
And if you have that checklist and

3085
02:16:17,141 --> 02:16:19,990
you're doing that,
that one thing every day and maybe the

3086
02:16:19,991 --> 02:16:22,720
first thing you're going to do is like
commit to making a list every day.

3087
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:26,200
That's a great step.
Once you start showing up for yourself

3088
02:16:26,230 --> 02:16:28,750
every day and doing that and checking
things off the list,

3089
02:16:28,751 --> 02:16:30,940
you start build self trust.
You start to have more integrity with

3090
02:16:30,941 --> 02:16:32,890
yourself.
You start to build momentum and then

3091
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:35,770
it's easy to take the next step and like
do the next thing.

3092
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,770
But without that momentum and without
that commitment,

3093
02:16:38,771 --> 02:16:42,790
I think people just expect their life to
change like this and it,

3094
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:45,370
like we've,
we've talked about this a lot.

3095
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:48,460
Like it just doesn't,
but those little stops,

3096
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:52,450
they start to make you feel better too
because you start to feel like,

3097
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:55,150
oh my gosh,
I'm not doing the same thing over and

3098
02:16:55,151 --> 02:16:57,790
over.
Cause that really is insanity.

3099
02:16:58,130 --> 02:17:02,050
One an Einstein who said insanity is
doing the same thing over and over again

3100
02:17:02,051 --> 02:17:04,460
expecting a different result.
I think it was like that.

3101
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:05,980
That to me is crazy making

3102
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:08,890
it is.
And also there's a thing that people

3103
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:14,100
have to be aware of and that is the trap
of falling back into old patterns

3104
02:17:14,111 --> 02:17:16,900
because they offer you comfort.
That happens to a lot of people that

3105
02:17:16,901 --> 02:17:19,300
want to lose weight.
Losing weight is a big one.

3106
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:21,130
They start,
they start off good,

3107
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:24,490
they start losing weight,
they start looking great and then

3108
02:17:24,491 --> 02:17:28,240
somewhere along the line,
that old pattern calls to them,

3109
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:29,750
this is us as hell.
Fuck

3110
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:30,780
donut man,
you've won,

3111
02:17:30,781 --> 02:17:34,240
or you've earned a donut krispy kreme.
Just get a couple of them with some big

3112
02:17:34,241 --> 02:17:37,120
deal tomorrow you get back on the track
and you just never do.

3113
02:17:37,250 --> 02:17:38,880
You never get back on track.
Yeah.

3114
02:17:39,030 --> 02:17:39,880
And it's,
it's,

3115
02:17:39,910 --> 02:17:43,210
it's a really common for people,
whether it's cigarette smoking or you

3116
02:17:43,211 --> 02:17:43,991
know,
fill in the blank,

3117
02:17:43,991 --> 02:17:47,830
whatever it is.
Old Patterns are really hard.

3118
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:52,480
They're really hard to avoid because
they offer some sort of bizarre comfort.

3119
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:54,940
Yeah.
They're like coping strategies and so

3120
02:17:54,941 --> 02:17:55,840
many ways,
I mean,

3121
02:17:55,841 --> 02:18:00,841
so many people eat or smoke or whatever
for comfort or to self soothe themselves

3122
02:18:01,570 --> 02:18:03,080
and so they can,
you know,

3123
02:18:03,081 --> 02:18:06,520
make a new year's resolution and lose
the weight and then if they haven't

3124
02:18:06,521 --> 02:18:11,380
found another way to cope with life when
things get hard or

3125
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:16,060
someone upsets them or whatever,
they were going to turn to that old

3126
02:18:16,061 --> 02:18:21,040
coping device because they haven't dealt
with the issue underneath what made them

3127
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:23,230
over ate or drank or smoke in the first
place.

3128
02:18:24,090 --> 02:18:24,923
Yeah.
And it's,

3129
02:18:24,980 --> 02:18:28,840
there's also,
when you're filled with anger and does

3130
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:30,700
all these things are fucked up in your
life.

3131
02:18:30,701 --> 02:18:34,030
There's something about those old
patterns that like give you a big hug.

3132
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:34,900
Yeah,

3133
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:37,840
yeah.
They did that like a warm fuzzy old

3134
02:18:37,841 --> 02:18:39,280
blanket,
but it's really disgusting.

3135
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:43,540
Covered with bacteria.
That's a good way to look at it.

3136
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,440
If people want to get ahold of you,
how do they do that?

3137
02:18:47,441 --> 02:18:48,274
How do they go about it?

3138
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:51,460
Oh,
well expectation hangover is my last

3139
02:18:51,461 --> 02:18:53,080
book.
