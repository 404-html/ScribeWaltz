1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,030
Done
Christine.

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:08,300
We're live.
We talked a lot before this podcast.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,680
We even said we weren't gonna talk.
We're like,

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,160
I don't want to talk to you too much.
A lot of stuff to talk about,

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,900
but Dan,
we got into everything.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,750
Christie Brinkley,
fibonacci sequence,

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,430
Tony Robbins,
Tony Robbins.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,440
We covered a lot of ground crime.
Boyfriends as dogs,

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,130
as protective dogs.
Yes.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Protect it.
How did you get to become a life coach?

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,560
Oh Gosh,
this wasn't the worst.

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:34,830
No,
no,

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,321
no,
no.

14
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:36,360
It's just,
it's not.

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,940
I never planned on it and I don't really
even like that.

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,580
That what's a good name?
I haven't come up with a better name for

17
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:43,414
it and let's come up with

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,930
maybe by the end of the show will come
up with something better so that that's.

19
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,980
That's your job.
Joe Got my new title by the end of the

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,550
show,
so I started out in Hollywood.

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,360
Actually.
I moved out after college to La because

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,300
mainly because growing up I was teased a
lot.

23
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:03,750
I was massively insecure and if you've
got something to prove,

24
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,450
Hollywood's a great place to come out
here to like,

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,470
oh,
fucking show you.

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,790
They'll show you.
Yeah.

27
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,550
I since I didn't fit in,
I didn't have a lot of friends and boys

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,100
didn't really ever like me unless they
wanted to cheat off my paper.

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,280
I became addicted to achieving and
that's like,

30
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,680
what can I be?
I want to be somebody like if only I was

31
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,930
somebody.
How old was I?

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,060
Oh Gosh,
when it started,

33
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:24,894
10,
eight,

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,860
something like that.

35
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,140
That's when you started like wanting to
prove yourself.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:29,930
Not

37
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,800
Teasing started happening and that's
when I started to feel like I didn't

38
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,490
really fit in and I needed to find a way
to feel worth something.

39
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,130
So overachieving kind of became my way
to do that.

40
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,960
And then at 10 I was diagnosed with
depression and put on Prozac at 10.

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,820
I know that's what we'll bookmark that
combined.

42
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,600
And so from a very early age,
I really thought something was wrong

43
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,390
with me.
I didn't fit in and so I had to come up

44
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:01,110
with these compensatory strategies to
feel worthy,

45
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:03,690
to feel validated.
I feel like I mattered and so I just

46
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,540
became like straight a student addicted
to achieving,

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,930
went out to college.
I grew up in Texas,

48
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,050
went to northwestern,
graduated early and was just committed

49
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,690
to moving to Hollywood and working my
way up as an actor.

50
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:16,231
I mean,
as a kid,

51
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:16,830
I was an actor.

52
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,240
I tried that for a little bit and then I
was like,

53
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,920
Whoa,
this is way too much rejection.

54
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,170
I can't deal with this.
I want to go on the other side of the

55
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:26,370
camera and pursue this career in
Hollywood and I didn't know what exactly

56
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:28,200
I was going to do.
I thought I was going to be a producer

57
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,210
or something like that,
but I came out.

58
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:35,211
I was 20 years old and I applied to the
William Morris Agency to be an

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,421
assistant.
They're like,

60
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,740
you have to go through the training
program,

61
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,440
which is like pushing mail carts around
and I did not want to do that.

62
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,441
So somehow I got a desk like really
early and started working for the head

63
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:49,050
of TV packaging and quickly learned I
did not want to be an agent,

64
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,750
just didn't like it.
It was crazy long hours.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,010
I was treated poorly.

66
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,490
It was just a hellish job and it was a
lot of selling and I didn't really like

67
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:01,180
that either.
So I left and actually went and worked

68
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,000
on the show.
You did?

69
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,410
I did.
I thought maybe I'll like production.

70
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,590
So first season as the man show I was
there,

71
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,770
which was kind of a blast and also just
crazy crazy show to work on.

72
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,870
I mean Jimmy and Adam were always like
super awesome to me,

73
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,150
but I was a young girl,
pa running around the jug dancers were

74
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,130
everywhere.
Like I just,

75
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,430
I was like,
what am I doing here?

76
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,020
So I quickly got out of production and
then started in comedy development at

77
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:32,620
paramount and started scouting comedians
and going to comedy clubs and finding

78
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,110
people that I could represent and bring
in,

79
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:40,030
maybe get deals for them.
And that quickly transitioned to moving

80
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:43,840
to another company where I was doing
comedy development and then I quickly

81
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,280
fell back into being an agent.

82
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,510
So that was like my first career was
like going to comedy clubs late at

83
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,800
night.
I'm at f two,

84
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,531
I think,
you know,

85
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,660
with the first client.
That was your first client.

86
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,050
That's fine.
I know Eddie very well was my very first

87
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,220
client.
We still keep in touch.

88
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,830
He says hi.
And that was like my life.

89
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:03,640
So here I am now 24,
25,

90
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,610
working at a big agency representing
clients.

91
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,440
I was the youngest female agent like in
the department,

92
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,380
maybe even in the city at that time,
I don't know,

93
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,840
it was really young,
got promoted really,

94
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,320
really super young and I was dating the
head of a movie studio and I was living

95
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:21,880
this amazing Hollywood life,
like making a lot of money going to the

96
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,070
Oscars and Golden Globes,
private jets.

97
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,370
Hanging out with celebrities,
like I totally had it all,

98
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,270
but I still wasn't happy.
It was like I had achieved one thing and

99
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,410
then there had to be the next thing.

100
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,750
And then I did achieve this and then it
had to be next thing you knew I'd get

101
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,920
the guy,
I still wouldn't be happy.

102
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,730
I get the promotion still.
I was on that constant chase and nothing

103
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,731
ever was like doing it.
So about two years I did this job,

104
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm still on antidepressants.
I'm also taking antianxiety pills at the

105
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:52,060
time and just like trying to like manage
my life.

106
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,240
And I was one of those people that I
could really look good from the outside.

107
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,720
I could seem like I had it all together
and the inside was a totally different

108
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,040
story.
It's Kinda like a duck on water,

109
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,970
you know,
looks smooth.

110
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,010
But underneath it's like,
that's,

111
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,230
that was what I was like.
And you know,

112
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:12,580
a lot of people ask me about how to
achieve all this and still like suffer

113
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:16,420
from depression.
And I was a very functional depressed

114
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,110
person.

115
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,600
Like a lot of people think if you're
depressed you just lay in bed all day

116
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,440
and watch soap operas or something.
But that's not the,

117
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,860
that doesn't,
you know,

118
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,550
summarize all depression.
Like there's different ways it shows up.

119
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,910
And so I was able to live my life,
but I always felt like something was

120
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:36,100
missing.
I always felt like I wasn't enough and I

121
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,650
just had this heavy,
heavy energy and,

122
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,840
and,
and nothing I could achieve whatever,

123
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,900
filling that gap.
So let me keep going.

124
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,540
So,
uh,

125
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,740
one day I was riding up in the elevator
to work and I had basically a mini panic

126
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,780
attack.
I just couldn't breathe.

127
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,140
I got off the elevator and I just
couldn't catch my breath and was looking

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,800
at.
There was a lot weird foot painting and

129
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:04,400
art in our office and I was looking at
the weird photos and the one outside of

130
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:08,960
my desk was this woman in a negligee who
is nine months pregnant in this huge

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,800
yard sale with a Ufo light shining down
on her about to take her up.

132
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,560
And I'm looking at this painting.
I feel like that's me.

133
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:18,300
How did I get here?

134
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,380
Here?
And I just,

135
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,510
I walked,
I went back down the elevator,

136
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:25,770
walked around Beverly Hills and then
came back upstairs and I just wanted to

137
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,240
quit.
All I wanted to do was quit.

138
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:28,720
I thought that was the answer was just
like,

139
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,110
I quit my job and reinvent myself and
start over,

140
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,350
but I needed someone to give me
permission and so I called my dad

141
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,100
because my dad is has always been there
for me and I'm like,

142
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:39,870
Dad,
I really want to quit this job.

143
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,510
Can I?
And He did a really good dad thing.

144
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,960
Really pissed me off at the time,
but it was a good dad move.

145
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,823
You want to guess what he did,

146
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,410
so you get your shit together,

147
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,150
said I love you,
but I can't make this decision for you.

148
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,430
That is a good dad thing.
Get that thing.

149
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,850
And he hung up and I quit the next day
and that was the first really big risk I

150
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,100
ever took.

151
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,490
Why did you feel like you were the
pregnant woman with a Ufo about to take

152
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,870
you off in a flying saucer?

153
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,850
Felt confused and lost and like,
I didn't fit in and like chaos and it's

154
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,590
all wrong and how did I get here and
what has happened?

155
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,470
Isn't it crazy that Hollywood has so
many stories?

156
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,370
I mean,
not obviously,

157
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,490
not exactly like yours,
but so many stories of people who were

158
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:32,930
rejected and who have decided they're
going to come here to prove something or

159
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:35,960
to get the love that they need and what
do they run into.

160
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,860
They're in the business of rejection for
every.

161
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,960
Most people don't really think about it
because most people don't act,

162
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,360
but if you try to act,
you have to audition.

163
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,730
If you audition,
you're going to audition with hundreds

164
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,190
of other people.
They're all trying to get the same job

165
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:52,250
and they treat you like hundreds of
other people were trying to get the same

166
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,700
job.
It's the weirdest thing and people leave

167
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,950
and they're just devastated.
They're so confused.

168
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,100
They get nervous before the thing and
then they leave the thing and they feel

169
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,410
so helpless.
Yep.

170
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,030
It's the.
It's a strange,

171
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,380
strange business

172
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,510
really is,
and it's.

173
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,630
It's so often not based on talent.
No,

174
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,900
it's so often not based on who's the
best person for the job and that's what

175
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:17,440
frustrated me as an agent and also one
of the reasons I left.

176
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,910
I had a deal that I put together Eddie.
He was actually involved in it and my

177
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:25,990
boss made me attach a show runner who
like nobody wanted and but he needed the

178
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:29,020
police of that client and it killed the
shout and it killed these guys that

179
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:29,610
opportunity

180
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,770
all the time,
all the time,

181
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,750
but happened to us.
When I took over the man show,

182
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:36,230
there was a show runner that there's
this,

183
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,920
this weird incestuous sort of fucking
business in Hollywood of connecting

184
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,510
people.
It's almost more about being social than

185
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,820
it is about anything else.
It's about making these relationships

186
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:51,630
almost like politics.
You become beholden to these people and

187
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,380
you get them jobs and they get you jobs
and you all just feed off of each and

188
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,800
y'all suck.
It really happens a lot.

189
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,030
It happens a lot with comedy writers.
Yup.

190
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,420
There's a lot of comedy writers that are
just,

191
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,803
you know,
there are.

192
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,870
They might have even been on Seinfeld or
something like a great show and there's

193
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,460
a few brilliant writers and there's a
few that are like,

194
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,500
what in the fuck is this guy doing here?
Well,

195
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,850
his agent is this guy's agent and that
guy,

196
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,240
agent force this guy in.
If you get that guy,

197
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,430
you get this guy too.
And they make these deals.

198
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,730
Exactly.
And that's what was so frustrating for

199
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,680
me.
If I'd have these really talented people

200
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,750
and I couldn't,
I couldn't get them jobs.

201
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,140
Why did they put you on Prozac at 10?
Do you,

202
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,450
were you an only child?
No,

203
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:30,701
no,
no.

204
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,020
I was the oldest,
the oldest.

205
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,160
How many kids?
Just to.

206
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,420
And I think,
you know,

207
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,060
my,
my parents loved me a lot and they just

208
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,450
were doing the best they could and they
were listening to doctors,

209
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,480
you know,
it was a time when,

210
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,070
if a doctor tells you something,
you listen,

211
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,290
what was bombing you out?
Like,

212
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,840
like what did,
what was it the point where they were

213
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,490
willing to put you on medication?

214
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,820
Well,
I think I went from when I was little,

215
00:09:51,821 --> 00:09:56,821
I was really outgoing and talkative and
happy.

216
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,060
And then when the teasing and bullying
started to happen,

217
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,660
I completely just shut down.
Like I shut off particular group of

218
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:08,460
people that did it to one girl.
Well,

219
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,020
she's the one I wanted to mention when I
won my Oscar that was,

220
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,250
wanted to get up there and say get up
there and then eventually,

221
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,220
eventually I got over that,
but I just,

222
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,700
I,
I really just shut down and withdrew and

223
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,040
so it's just like.
Did you move to a different school or

224
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,420
was it just one particular kid?

225
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,100
They wanted me.
My parents were like,

226
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:28,110
go to a different school,
honey.

227
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,560
Like,
and I just wouldn't.

228
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,780
I was,
I was stubborn and I wanted to stay and

229
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,190
I think I was just scared,
you know,

230
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:36,920
that's the thing.
Like oftentimes what we know that's,

231
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,380
that's bad is safer,
feel safer than what we don't know that

232
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:44,620
might be better at my had a comfort zone
and where I was like,

233
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:47,080
even though I wasn't really happy,
like I knew that school,

234
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,210
I knew,
I was afraid that if I went to new

235
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,310
school I would just have to deal with
the same thing.

236
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,680
So I was just like,
I'll just stay where I am.

237
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,270
Isn't it crazy that you could run into
the wrong person when you're 10 years

238
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,580
old?
And it could fuck you up for a decade or

239
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:00,270
two.

240
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

241
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,530
But I think we,
I mean,

242
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,900
I don't know any human who hasn't had
something in childhood or adulthood or

243
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,890
whatever that is.
We can call bad jamie.

244
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,000
We're them.
Perfect.

245
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,220
Nothing's ever went wrong.
Nothing's ever gone wrong with you.

246
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,060
Just wait.
It's coming from

247
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,420
smooth and calm.
Young James collected.

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,621
Yeah.
No,

249
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:23,310
everybody's had difficulties.
It's unavoidable.

250
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,650
But w,
the bullying thing is very.

251
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,210
It's very strange how prevalent it is
and how it seems to be a part of human

252
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:35,211
nature that people have some strange
desire to find someone who's weak or

253
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:40,920
who's insecure or who is.
And then literally go after them and put

254
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:44,010
yourself in front of them and fuck with
them and ruin their life.

255
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:45,030
Their shit.
Let's go get her.

256
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,070
Like that kind of shit is.
It's a weird natural pattern that human

257
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,020
beings follow.
And I've always wondered like,

258
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,710
we need to talk to God sad about this.
Like what is the evolutionary basis for

259
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,260
that?
Like what is it about people that makes

260
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,510
them want to do that?
Especially young people.

261
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,780
Bull,
I don't,

262
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,340
you know,
and I think it's different with the

263
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,880
white girls do it in the way boys do
girls do it.

264
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,440
It's,
it's a little more sneaky and I think a

265
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,800
lot of times it's based more on jealousy
and that might have like,

266
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,650
I don't know,
that might have some girl unattractive.

267
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,720
No,
I think that um,

268
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,420
I was,
I was smart.

269
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,410
School came easy for me.
The teachers really liked me,

270
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:25,190
parents liked me and so I think that
that might have had something to do with

271
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,940
it and again I don't know,
you know,

272
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,150
is 10,
like I have no idea why they did what

273
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,730
they did,
but it was more sneaky like passing

274
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:35,570
around notes saying I joined the I hate
Christine club and like having everyone

275
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:40,571
sign it and just kind of quietly doing
it behind my back and pulling all my

276
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:44,030
friends way where I think boys are just
more aggressive.

277
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,590
Like they'll,
they'll beat you up,

278
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:47,340
they'll put you in lockers,
they'll do that,

279
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,690
that kind of thing.
But I think it's just a,

280
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,230
a power thing and you know,
within every bully as a scared little

281
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,210
boy or little girl.
So it's just,

282
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,970
I think how we were always,
not always,

283
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:01,370
but so much of the time we're trying to
compensate for something,

284
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,200
you know,
or refill less than where we feel

285
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,660
insecure.
We think if we can just have power over

286
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,180
something or somebody else that's going
to make us feel better.

287
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,160
There's also a thing that happens when
like the I hate Christine Club thing

288
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,450
where the other girls would probably
like,

289
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,690
I don't want to be on the end of that,
so I'm going to join in.

290
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,640
You get scared that they're going to go
after you next and you want to be on the

291
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,440
main team.
I think that's what's going on with

292
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,330
Donald trump.
I really do.

293
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,590
I think that's a lot of the reason why
people are with him and for him he's,

294
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,120
he's so vindictive and mean and the way
it goes after people,

295
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,400
I think you see a lot of people support
him and sort of like,

296
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,800
like cower to him.
Like even that Megan Kelly chick who's a

297
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,720
super brassy Badass ice princess,
she did that interview with him after

298
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,450
they had their little thing when she sat
down with them and she was.

299
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,590
She was so like submissive.
It was weird.

300
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:55,060
It was.
I mean maybe we should try to keep her

301
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,130
job.
Maybe Fox News where the riot act,

302
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,580
I don't know,
but it was really bizarre to watch her

303
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,190
tone down.
You ever see?

304
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,660
See the followup interviews?
Does.

305
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:05,110
She didn't.
She didn't call him out on anything.

306
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,963
Thanks.
She just.

307
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,820
No,
she was really submissive.

308
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,220
It was,
it was not what I expected it was.

309
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:12,870
It was very orchestrated.
I mean,

310
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:15,150
I think it was kind of obvious at that
point.

311
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:18,330
I don't know if he had,
he was the nominee or he was on his way.

312
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:23,010
It looked like all the other nominees
were falling apart and she did this

313
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,660
interview with her and him sat in some
office room,

314
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:30,900
like sat across from a table and it was
like people are scared.

315
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,490
People are scared of,
of the the strong man or strong woman,

316
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:35,781
you know,
the,

317
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:37,860
the,
the person who's going to go after you

318
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,010
or the unpredictable,
like I think Donald is so unpredictable.

319
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,170
You never know what he's going to throw
at you and he,

320
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,020
he will go to whatever lengths he needs
to go to,

321
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:49,440
to humiliate,
to make you feel less than two to throw

322
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:50,760
you off your game,
you know?

323
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:53,930
So she probably was just like,
I better just,

324
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,350
well he just,
he sues so many people and so many

325
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:57,910
people sue him,
his,

326
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,150
that's his world,
you know,

327
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,940
and that's,
that's like a normal thing for him.

328
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,390
If he doesn't have a bunch of lawsuits
floating around the world probably feels

329
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:07,510
like nothing is even happening today.
Going to gotta get something going.

330
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:10,510
I got sue somebody crazy.
But I think that that,

331
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,890
that is one of the reasons why people
like are attracted to him because they

332
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:17,550
don't want to be on his bad side.
I think people were terrified of them.

333
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,700
You know,
super billionaire,

334
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,690
very famous,
big,

335
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,780
powerful guy.
I think there's a bunch of people that,

336
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,000
like with this,
I hate Christine Club.

337
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,720
If there was this one mean bitch that
just wanted to go after you,

338
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:35,950
there's probably a bunch of people that
would want to side with her just because

339
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:39,340
they're scared that she's going to turn
on them and start going after them next.

340
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,020
I think that's probably right.
Yeah,

341
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,980
for sure.
It's,

342
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,970
it's totally,
it's,

343
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,850
it's a tribal thing.
It becomes this weird,

344
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,230
like that's,
that's our leader now.

345
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:48,064
You gotTa,
you know,

346
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,610
a lot of leaders are the most vicious,
mean,

347
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,350
nasty,
terrifying people,

348
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,350
you know,
look at the dictators in Russia or Putin

349
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,750
or Kim Jong Una and what are they known
for?

350
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,170
The dictators and a lot of these Middle
Eastern countries,

351
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,520
they're fucking ruthless,
ruthless people and everyone's scared of

352
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:06,560
them.
So the whole goal behind them,

353
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:06,970
you know?

354
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,460
Yep.
Better to be behind them,

355
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,940
go up against them to feel the RAF.
Yep.

356
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,840
Yeah.
I think fear is a big motivator

357
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,400
unfortunately.
And,

358
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,870
and it I think impacts our ability to
really think clearly about something

359
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,820
because we're just so scared and so
threatened that we,

360
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,560
we stopped questioning,
wait a second.

361
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:29,340
Like what is he really saying?
When is he really leading me to?

362
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,540
Yeah.
Because that's the thing with Donald and

363
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,220
I talk to people who support him.
I'm like,

364
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,050
but do you do,
do you understand?

365
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:39,280
Like he would have more money if you
were to just like taken the money.

366
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:43,370
His father left him and invested it
versus all the bankrupting he's done in

367
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,760
the keys.
There's just so much that doesn't make

368
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,620
sense about him yet.
I'm just like,

369
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:48,454
okay,
well

370
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,050
it's never been a man alive that needs
mushrooms more than Donald Trump is.

371
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,550
There is.
I haven't heard of them.

372
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,613
I mean,
I'm sure.

373
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm sure there probably has been.
But he needs him back.

374
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,890
He needs to go straight to the Amazon.
Yeah,

375
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:03,280
you might need to go right there,
but he needs something.

376
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,350
It's just,
he's,

377
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,640
he's almost like this super impulsive
huberous character.

378
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,300
Yeah.
You know,

379
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,420
everything is like when Hillary Clinton
says,

380
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:14,520
you know,
he doesn't pay taxes because.

381
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,420
Because I'm smart,
like he can't help,

382
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:18,970
like you're on the deer at a fucking
debate on TV.

383
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,460
You said you're smart because you don't
pay taxes.

384
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,323
Right.

385
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,730
Really reflects.
I mean it's not just him like it really

386
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:29,731
reflects like where we are as a society
that enough people support him to get

387
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,990
him to the place that he is.
I think we're so polarized right now and

388
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:35,351
like,
look,

389
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:37,330
I don't really love either candidate to
be honest.

390
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,400
I just don't.
But I think that.

391
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:43,450
I hope that maybe this is just wishful
thinking that will have four years of

392
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:47,110
whoever it is.
I think it will be hillary and then in

393
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:51,330
the next election we'll have people run
that we're actually excited about

394
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:52,380
supporting and voting for

395
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,210
maybe,
but I don't see those people anywhere.

396
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,810
The job one wants the job.
That's the problem.

397
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,400
It's a crazy job and it's a job where
they try to destroy you if you run for

398
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:04,300
it,
you know,

399
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:07,060
and you're seeing that with,
with trump and you're seeing that with

400
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:11,320
hillary and they're pulling out all the
stops and by the time it's over,

401
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:15,970
the opinion of the commander in chief,
it's going to be terrible no matter who

402
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:16,804
wins.
Right?

403
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,390
I mean there.
I mean that Crooked Hillary thing is

404
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,390
going to stick forever.
Hashtag Crooked Hillary.

405
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,500
That's gonna stick forever and People's
opinion of him is horrible.

406
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
You know,
it's no matter who wins and she's going

407
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,410
to win,
most likely,

408
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,130
but it's not good.
It's not good for any of us.

409
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,770
Nope.
It doesn't represent what we think of

410
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:39,460
the United States as we think of the
United States as being this unbelievable

411
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:44,230
place of creativity and innovation and
the greatest superpower the world's ever

412
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:47,100
known and this,
you know,

413
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,350
this really progressive force for good
in the world.

414
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:51,610
And you know,

415
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,440
I don't know,
maybe we need to go through this time

416
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:58,730
though to shake it up a little bit.
Maybe things need to get bad to get

417
00:18:58,731 --> 00:18:59,470
better.
I mean,

418
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,700
I see that in human psychology so much,
you know,

419
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,700
you need to hit rock bottom,
you need to go through these hard times

420
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,600
so you have something better emerge that
maybe that's just wishful thinking.

421
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,270
No,
I think you're probably right.

422
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:14,860
I think we also needed to understand
because of the wikileaks revelations,

423
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:18,940
like how exactly politics is run.
Even with the people we think that are

424
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:22,390
the good folks,
like it's all fucking gross and dirty

425
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:25,360
and all the stuff with the Clinton
Foundation and all the stuff they did to

426
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:29,030
Bernie sanders and they conspired to
keep that guy out and there's.

427
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,420
I mean he's a Democrat too.
There are a whole.

428
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,340
The whole thing was supposed to be about
who is the person that best represents

429
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:41,341
the people with the people choose,
but now the Democratic National

430
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,070
Committee was fucking working to make
sure that Bernie Sanders wasn't the guy

431
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,570
and they were all conspiring with
Hillary and they're all pulling favors.

432
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:53,110
This just like we were talking about
before with producers and networks.

433
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:56,200
It's the same shit.
It's just using your power and your

434
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:58,960
influence and all the friends that
you've made and all the years and all

435
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:03,820
the favors and and pulling it together,
but now we're being exposed to it in a

436
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:06,760
way that we haven't really,
since Watergate,

437
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,760
Watergate gave us like a little window,
a tiny little window,

438
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,910
but the access to information was so
minuscule back then,

439
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,120
like we clung to those 15 minutes of
whatever,

440
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,650
Watergate tapes,
whatever it was,

441
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,740
and we look at this.

442
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,210
I'm not a crook.
He was doing what they were all doing.

443
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,030
He just got caught and we got to.
We got a sense of it now,

444
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,390
but now when you read these emails,
but how they really feel about each

445
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:34,180
other and all the fucking gross list
that goes on.

446
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,100
Well,
I try to not engage too much in the

447
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:40,200
gross ness because it's just like,
what's the point?

448
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,950
I guess the point is to understand what
the world really is about.

449
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,320
What the structure,
the government that looms over us is

450
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:53,530
really all about.
Why are certain things legal?

451
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:56,890
Why certain things illegal?
Why are certain loopholes in place?

452
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,380
How did they get in place?
Who benefits from them?

453
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,110
What is a charity and if it is a
charity,

454
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:06,340
how come you get paid so much?
Like how come you get paid $250,000 to

455
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,430
speak and then all this money goes to
your charity,

456
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:13,450
but that $250,000 goes to you.
Like you just talked for an hour.

457
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:14,680
Like this is a scam,

458
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,230
but that's the thing like you're asking,
you're being curious,

459
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,020
being curious.
You're asking questions and I think

460
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:23,050
that's helpful.
I think what so many people are doing or

461
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:27,370
just getting mad and just trash talking
in America and the candidates and and

462
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:31,390
that doesn't do any good for anybody.
If you want to like ask questions and

463
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,060
get involved and start to get curious
and quest,

464
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,140
that's,
that's awesome.

465
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,960
That's how we change things,
but I think too much of this has just

466
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:42,100
been so emotionally driven that people
are just getting upset and not really

467
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,180
going home.
What can I do?

468
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:46,150
What can I learn?
How can I shift this in some way?

469
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,160
Yeah.
It's also people are like super psyched

470
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:53,010
to get behind their candidate.
Third team.

471
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,200
I got to tell you like there's a lot of
gross on both sides for sure.

472
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,280
There's a lot of grossness on the trump
side.

473
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:04,030
There's a lot of mean assholes that have
finally found another mean asshole

474
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,170
that's running for president and they're
pumped like he's one of them,

475
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,440
but then there's a lot of men who are
using Hashtag.

476
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:14,550
I'm with her and they're the grossest
little fucking white knights.

477
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,760
Oh my God.
I've run across a few of them on

478
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:19,630
twitter,
like a white knight.

479
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,990
You don't know what a white knight is.
How dare you.

480
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,700
You really don't know like a knight in
shining armor.

481
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,080
A man who comes along comes along and
positions himself as the superior

482
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,330
morally superior to call Michael Shermer
calls a virtue signaling as someone who

483
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,940
would would say Hashtag,
I'm with her Hashtag male feminist,

484
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,140
you know,
Hashtag.

485
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,790
That's real.
There's a lot of those out there.

486
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,720
Yeah,
they.

487
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,300
They're trying hard.
They couldn't get laid in any other way,

488
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,040
and this is,
this is the strategy.

489
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,700
There was the strategies to position
themselves as the super progressive.

490
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,820
Yeah.
It's like people who don't want you to

491
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:59,880
think that they're racist,
so they go out of their way to

492
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:02,910
discriminate against white people,
other white people when they're white.

493
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,530
I read this thing with this woman was
saying,

494
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,270
if you are a white person and you were
up for a job and you are up against a

495
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:12,690
person of color,
do period not period.

496
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,570
Take that job.
You don't deserve it.

497
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,850
Examine white privilege.
I was like,

498
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,940
oh my God,
what Liberal Arts College do you belong

499
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,670
to?
What fucking crazy shit is in your head?

500
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,030
Like what?
I don't get it at all.

501
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,830
Period.
Not Period.

502
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:31,430
Take that job.
Yeah,

503
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,580
well you don't have to get it.
We went on a tangent.

504
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,950
We went off.
We were trying to find out how you

505
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,280
become a life coach and all of a sudden
you're talking politics,

506
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,860
White,
White Knights.

507
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,290
I love it.
I love it.

508
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,760
Yeah,
and now I now I know a whole new

509
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,150
understanding of white nights.
Well,

510
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,610
I always understood it as,
you know,

511
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,010
the man who's going to come in and
rescue

512
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,490
that would,
they're positioning themselves as that,

513
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:54,324
but that,
you know,

514
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,620
I think we're a couple decades away from
all this going away because I think

515
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:00,930
technology is going government going
away,

516
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,870
all bullshit,
all bullshit and lies.

517
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,520
I really believe this.
I think technology is going to enable

518
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,730
just like no one anticipated.
As you can go back to the first days of

519
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,860
cameras,
if you went back to the 18 hundreds,

520
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:20,480
they first had a camera.
No one would have ever thought that in

521
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,380
the lifespan of just.
I mean,

522
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:23,370
what was the first camera?
Jamie?

523
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:25,800
Like 18 slash 60,
something like that.

524
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:29,070
Like civil war era was like the first
cameras.

525
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,640
No one would've ever thought that in two
lifespans,

526
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:34,680
which is essentially what it is from
then to now,

527
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,180
you'd be able to send video to Australia
instantaneously from something that

528
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:44,100
slips into your pocket,
find blind when he like,

529
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,950
stop

530
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,880
to think about how much we've seen in
our lifetime.

531
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,850
Yeah.
I think we're just so used to it.

532
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,680
We're so used to google and the Internet
and when Hillary Clinton was telling

533
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,480
like Donald Trump said something and
she's like,

534
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:56,860
Google it,
Google what?

535
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,120
He said,
it's not true,

536
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,290
and it was like how hilarious is that
Hillary Clinton is telling people to

537
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,750
Google Donald trump.
Like that's,

538
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,840
that's how beautiful access to
information is today.

539
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,420
I think we are a couple decades,
maybe a little bit more away from a

540
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:18,421
completely new paradigm,
a completely new way of accessing

541
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:21,310
information.
I think we're going to submit to

542
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,400
something,
whether it's a neural implant or some

543
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:28,990
sort of augmented reality and we're
going to be able to read intention and

544
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:30,970
thoughts.
It's going to be there's not gonna be

545
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:33,820
any lying 100 years.
I really believe that.

546
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,120
Totally think you're right.
And I think that's why we're seeing so

547
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:39,150
many of these systems break down like
the presidential election,

548
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,090
which used to be this coveted amazing
thing.

549
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,950
Now we're kind of looking at it like
it's,

550
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:46,500
it's a reality TV show.
That's what it seems like now

551
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,800
is all pussy grabbing,
craziness,

552
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,130
craziness.
That's the believe that

553
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,570
first,
like 20 minutes of the second debate.

554
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,100
Well,
I had been out of the country for a

555
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,560
month,
which was so refreshing and to come back

556
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,260
and I watched it and the first 20
minutes was just character slams.

557
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:08,100
It was nothing about nothing,
about the issues or anything and I was

558
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:08,730
just like,
what,

559
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,660
what's,
what's happening?

560
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,140
That doesn't make me happy.
Like it doesn't make me feel like if he

561
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,950
shits on her,
she shits on him and she,

562
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,670
she tears him down.
It doesn't make me feel like she's

563
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:19,800
better.
I liked her and one of the debates

564
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,880
because I didn't tune into it until the
last hour and he was saying a bunch of

565
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:26,730
crazy shit and she would start laughing.
I was like,

566
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,330
that's how she should handle him.
She should handle him like he's a child.

567
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,720
Like if she did that,
but she's fucking crazy too.

568
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,010
So depending president of another
tangent,

569
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,930
lots of fantasy life coaching.
How,

570
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,100
how do you go from.

571
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,550
All right,
so we're running mad at both of us,

572
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:48,410
by the way.
I'm sorry.

573
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,220
Suitable politics.
Yeah.

574
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,700
How about you just shut the up.
I will totally own that.

575
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,260
I,
that's not my area of expertise.

576
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,320
That's what nobody knows shit about
politics,

577
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,370
even the people doing it.
That's why Donald Trump's running for

578
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,860
fucking president,
nobody saw that common,

579
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,510
you know,
and nobody understands this stupid

580
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:04,660
system.
Yeah.

581
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,400
But You understand life coaching.
I see.

582
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,210
Yes.
We're going to come up with a better

583
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,490
name,
but her name and that's our live

584
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,131
coaching.
Yes.

585
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,160
But,
so the way it happened is

586
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,001
um,
all right,

587
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,990
so I quit my job,
which threw me into an even worse

588
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:20,030
depression because that was my whole
identity,

589
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,430
like it was my success in being an
agent.

590
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,280
And so then in a period of,
I don't know,

591
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,360
like six to eight months,
a bunch of things happened,

592
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:29,420
I went into lots of debt because I tried
to keep up with this lifestyle.

593
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,740
I,
um,

594
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,730
was a strange from my family for a bit
because I made a choice that they didn't

595
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:37,640
really like.
And I got diagnosed with another

596
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,100
autoimmune disorder on top of everything
else.

597
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,320
And then I was engaged and thought,
oh,

598
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:44,570
I'm going to be a wife.
Like that's my next role.

599
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,090
I'll be fine.
And then six months before my wedding,

600
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:50,570
he dumped me cultivating.
So I in that,

601
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,100
you know,
I know people listening to I've been

602
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:55,490
through worse,
but in that like span at 26 years old,

603
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,700
losing my career and money and family
and health and love,

604
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,380
it was Kinda like this sucks like this.

605
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,920
I really didn't know what to do.
And I had honestly a moment on my

606
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,990
bathroom floor,
which I don't know why I was on my

607
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:11,530
bathroom floor was disgusting,
but she was laying there.

608
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,910
It's a good spot to cry the tiles and
nice and cold,

609
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:18,911
you know,
it feels very dramatic and I had this

610
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,630
like kind of insight I guess you could
say,

611
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,900
of how much I was relating to everything
as a total victim as like everything was

612
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:33,830
happening to me.
And then it dawned on me I'm the common

613
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:36,890
denominator in like all of these
situations.

614
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,150
So either I have just really bad luck or
I have some influence over this.

615
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,960
And again,
like it was just a teeny bit of an

616
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:48,470
insight.
But it was enough of a new perspective

617
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,550
on my life that kind of got me off the
bathroom floor and started to give me

618
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:57,551
some kind of hope and started to make me
realize I needed help and like I,

619
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,930
the way I was doing my life wasn't going
to work anymore.

620
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,620
And so I found,
I thought I was having a quarter life

621
00:29:03,621 --> 00:29:08,621
crisis and I found a book by that name
and I read it and it was fine,

622
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,650
but it wasn't going deep enough for me.
So I decided to write a book about like

623
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,740
my experience and everything I was
learning and how I like was getting

624
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:22,040
myself off my bathroom floor I guess.
And I was interviewing people for the

625
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:25,100
book and they kept saying things to me
like,

626
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,040
can I set up a session with you?
And I'd say why I got all the

627
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:28,880
information.
And they said,

628
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:30,170
well,
aren't you a coach or a counselor or

629
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,310
something?
And I'd say no.

630
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,290
And they said you should be,
you should be,

631
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,160
you should be,
you should be.

632
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,260
And I kept hearing this over and over
and over again.

633
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:40,190
So I went to my coach and kind of my
first teacher who I met when I was 22

634
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:43,360
and I was still seeing,
she has had a major impact in my life

635
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,411
and I said,
Mona,

636
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,910
you know,
everybody's telling me I should do this

637
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,610
and I've been looking for my career for
years,

638
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,990
maybe this is what I'm supposed to do.

639
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,153
She's like,
Yep,

640
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,780
Yep,
that's what you're supposed to do.

641
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,940
And I got out,
I've been coming for five years,

642
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:56,680
like,
why didn't you tell me this?

643
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:57,371
And she said,
you know,

644
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:59,020
you had to figure it out,
you had to find it.

645
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,890
And so that's how it just started.
Like people kept reflecting back to me,

646
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:03,730
hey,
you're good at this,

647
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:06,310
you should do this.
And I didn't really know how or what.

648
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,040
And so then I just became,
I started studying it.

649
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,230
I apprenticed with her,
I got training,

650
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:14,920
I got a master's degree,
I wrote more books and it just sort of

651
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:19,840
happened out of my own life and out of
just creating things that I thought

652
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,850
would help people and people going,
actually,

653
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,710
this is really helping me and can I talk
to you more?

654
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,820
And that was,
you know,

655
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,530
a good 10,
11 years ago.

656
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,510
Have you pushed the mic forward a little
bit more and make the sound consistent?

657
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,050
It's,
it sounds good in your ear.

658
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,590
Just the recording.
You'll be weird.

659
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,620
It is an interesting thing that it's
oftentimes small choices that people

660
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:43,150
make that dictate what happens to them
in their life.

661
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,180
But if you just decide that things are
happening to you,

662
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,760
you don't take any responsibility for
any of the choices.

663
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,440
That's,
to me the biggest difference are people

664
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:55,640
who are able to change their life and
people who don't is ownership,

665
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,760
is realizing that yes,
things happen but we're not victims and

666
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:03,710
anything can happen,
but at the same exact thing happened to

667
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:06,950
you and I and we can make different
choices about what we make it mean and

668
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:10,280
how we respond to it and we're going to
create different results based on that.

669
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,730
So it's not what happens to people.
It's not just luck.

670
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,420
It's truly what are you going to choose
to believe about it.

671
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,400
And that's to me the key differentiator
between staying where you are and kind

672
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:26,750
of regressing as you get older and just
repeating you're familiar patterns and

673
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:31,460
prints and repeat life and more stubborn
and all those things and you know,

674
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:35,870
just looking for those short term bursts
of happiness and like a trip or a bottle

675
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:40,871
of wine or whatever versus like really
getting clear about how you can change

676
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,470
your life,
what your purpose is,

677
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:44,870
what brings you joy and like who you
really are.

678
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,870
There's a thing about life coaching to
or any,

679
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:49,650
but I mean,
just to forget that word,

680
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,680
but the idea that your dispensing advice
or giving out inspiration or you know,

681
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,760
writing things down that have affected
and helped an enhanced you,

682
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,130
people want to dismiss that stuff like,
oh,

683
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:03,030
I don't need that.
Oh,

684
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:06,930
that's nothing,
but I feel like one of the best things

685
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:11,610
about being a part of a community or
being a part of a culture is that you

686
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:15,360
get to look at all of the things that
people have done that have benefited

687
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:19,080
them and all of the,
the positive choices that someone is

688
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:22,470
made and you can learn and experience
those without having to go through all

689
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:23,410
their bullshit.
Yeah.

690
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,350
You know,
and there's a lot of things that I've

691
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:29,730
learned from people whether I've read
things that they've said or listen to

692
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:32,730
speeches that they've given about
mistakes that they've made.

693
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,220
Where I've come across a similar moment
in my life when my ob,

694
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,870
I've,
I know what this is,

695
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,790
I know what that is.
It's,

696
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,710
I think it's one of the best tools that
we have.

697
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,000
When,
when,

698
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,550
when it comes to improving and enhancing
your own life,

699
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:51,551
your own individual experience is
looking at all the different shit that

700
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:55,190
other people have done and it's a.
it's a weird one because people dismiss

701
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:57,110
it so easily.
They don't,

702
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,640
first of all,
they dismiss it at A.

703
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,020
There's a certain amount of Hubris and a
certain amount of ego attached to it

704
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:06,710
where they don't want to admit they have
an issue or they don't want to admit

705
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:11,420
they need help or they don't wanna admit
that they need to be inspired or they

706
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,730
need some sort of motivation.

707
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,840
I think it's.
Yeah,

708
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,430
I think it's fear.
Yeah.

709
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,940
That whole,
this life that I know is comfortable.

710
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:25,380
I may not like it,
but I'm so scared of uncertainty that I

711
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,250
don't want to make the changes.
You know,

712
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,610
people are terrified of the unknown.

713
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,690
There's also a lot of fuckery of foot
when it comes to life coaches and

714
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:38,950
motivational speakers and there's a lot
of hosers like we were talking about

715
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:39,850
before,
the podcast,

716
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,160
about a couple of hoses.
We know there's hosers out there and

717
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,420
those people,
but it's like everything else.

718
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,330
Like,
you know,

719
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,310
there's bad car mechanics,
you know,

720
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:51,330
they'll put a used part and your car and
fuck you over this.

721
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,680
There's bad doctors,
there's bad everything.

722
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,440
Everything in this world as someone
who's half passing it.

723
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,240
And the problem with that whole,
the idea of being a life coach or being

724
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:04,660
a motivational speaker is that there's
not really,

725
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:06,550
like,
you don't have to get a phd to do it.

726
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:07,690
You don't have to,
you know,

727
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:11,170
you don't have to like prove yourself.
Like Mike has opened up 15 different

728
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:12,670
businesses,
so he's going to show you how to do a

729
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:14,650
business.
Like this guy's a successful

730
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:16,360
businessman.
That makes sense.

731
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,330
But there's a lot of people out there
that are doing life coaching that are

732
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:21,200
fucking failures.
Yeah.

733
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,490
And maybe maybe that's not the worst
thing in the world to be a failure

734
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:28,360
because you've learned from those
failures and maybe your achievement or

735
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:33,100
your contribution is expressing those
failures and your revelations from those

736
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:36,130
failures and that can help somebody else
not make those same mistakes.

737
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,951
Yeah,
I mean,

738
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,500
I think I've had a lot of so called
failures and mistakes.

739
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,090
Um,
did you ever have one of those like

740
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,330
bathroom floor moments?
So it's like life pivot.

741
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,980
Oh Man.
First of all,

742
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,090
check on the floor.

743
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,030
Yeah.
I mean I'm not all bullshit aside.

744
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:53,691
Yeah.
Yeah,

745
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,740
there's always um,
for,

746
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,430
for a comic,
the big one is bombing.

747
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,710
Bombing on stage is devastating and you
start thinking like,

748
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:05,420
I can't,
I can't do this.

749
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:08,030
Like you can only take so many of those
bombings in your life.

750
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,300
It's like getting beaten up.
You can only get beaten up so many times

751
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,520
before,
like your brain stops working.

752
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:17,990
Right?
And there's that relationship breakups

753
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,690
for sure.
Um,

754
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:25,210
devastations I think are always the best
for a rebirth.

755
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,440
And at the time they don't feel like it.
No.

756
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,110
And devastations anything devastating
that happens to you in your life while

757
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:34,340
it's happening.
You feel like,

758
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,890
I don't know if I can take this,
but then you get through it and you have

759
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:40,530
this sort of enhanced perspective.
And then you also,

760
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,410
we live in an amazing time where you can
see,

761
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,180
you know,
not that you should revel in other

762
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,690
people's failures,
but you could like,

763
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,750
look what most of your failure is.
Nothing in comparison to what's going on

764
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,700
in a million like Syria or million
different parts of the world that are

765
00:35:56,701 --> 00:36:01,701
just filled with fucking chaos.
Most people can't see that because you

766
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:05,400
see your life and your life is all,
you know when your life is falling

767
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:05,770
apart.

768
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,401
Right.
Well,

769
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:08,170
and I think too,
you know,

770
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:13,390
we get so kind of narcissistic and our
problems that we forget the bigger

771
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,480
perspective and we don't.
A lot of people talk about being happy

772
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:19,360
all the time.
You should be.

773
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,580
And I just don't think that that's real.
I think that you,

774
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,510
I've grown and I through contrast
through,

775
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,433
you know,
I,

776
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,290
I think I really understand happiness,
enjoy because have really understood

777
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,160
depression and sadness.
Like that polarity I think is such a big

778
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:35,020
part of what we're here for.

779
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,210
Yeah.
I mean you look at your read a book

780
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:39,640
about different parts of the world and
what's going on.

781
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:41,500
You if you're still happy to read that
book,

782
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,360
something wrong with you,
you know,

783
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,970
like,
probably shouldn't be happy all the

784
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,110
time.
There was actually,

785
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,780
I think it was scientific America or
something like that that had an article

786
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:54,100
recently saying you're not going to be
happy all the time and you shouldn't be.

787
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:55,870
And there's an a,
there's a reason for it.

788
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,960
There's peaks and valleys in everything
in life.

789
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,570
Yep.
And that I,

790
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,540
you know,
for people listening that might be in

791
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,950
one of those valleys,
it's like,

792
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,930
don't try to just get through it,
really ask,

793
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,280
you know,
why,

794
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,210
what can I learn from this?
That was my biggest thing is I stopped

795
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:17,750
asking why is this happening to me?
And started asking,

796
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:18,883
what can I learn?

797
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,450
Yeah.
So instead of painting yourself as a

798
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:23,260
victim,
you paint yourself as someone who's

799
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,020
present in the moment and just,
okay,

800
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:27,510
I don't want to do this anymore.
Let's figure out what's going on.

801
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,530
Exactly.
And we don't.

802
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,170
A lot of times we don't have the tools
and that's where things like life

803
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:34,290
coaching and personal development come
in handy is cause we can go and get

804
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:38,550
those tools instead of using our old
coping mechanisms by like being strong

805
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:41,080
or overseen overworking,
overdrinking over,

806
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,920
do you know,
jumping into a relationship like

807
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,150
whatever it may be.
We,

808
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:48,420
we don't really learn how to deal with
disappointment,

809
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,040
failure,
anger or shame,

810
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:53,160
any of those things.
And so we're kind of left to these quick

811
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:56,820
fix devices that in.
I think that's a big reason addiction is

812
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:01,440
such a problem is because we don't
really learn how to manage emotion and

813
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:05,160
how to manage this appointment.
And so we go for that thing that makes

814
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,010
us feel better in the moment.
But the problem is we have to keep

815
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,780
upping the ante.
You know,

816
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,260
at first that one glass of wine does the
trick,

817
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,910
but then you need to then you need
three,

818
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:16,860
then you add vodka,
they whatever it may be.

819
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,390
And so I,
I mean,

820
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,460
why I'm so passionate about what I do
is,

821
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:22,500
first of all,
I never,

822
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,890
I never thought I could be happy.
Like I really didn't.

823
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,690
I thought that this,
you know,

824
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:33,600
I was going to be depressed and I just
was gonna constantly be looking for

825
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:38,601
something to fix me.
I never really truly thought this life

826
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:41,620
that I'm living now was possible.
Again,

827
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,110
externally things look fine.
But internally I'm talking about a

828
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:49,111
totally different kind of experience and
it's only because of those like really

829
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:53,590
awful moments.
I call them expectation hangovers that I

830
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:58,591
was kind of desperate enough to let go
of my normal coping mechanisms and my

831
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,530
trying to control everything.
It was like the ultimate and surrender

832
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,990
truly of going okay.
Like I don't,

833
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,690
I don't know,
I need to find a different way to deal

834
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:10,510
with this.
And that's really what has led me down

835
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:12,280
the path that,
that I am today.

836
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,620
So,
you know,

837
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,900
I,
I think that life coaching and the

838
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:18,850
personal transformation industry and all
that.

839
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:20,350
Like you said,
there's a lot of,

840
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,450
what'd you call them?
Hoke cookies.

841
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,490
Posers,
posers,

842
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,540
Bob and Doug.
Mckenzie,

843
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,810
I don't even know who that is.
Fucking 19 eighties.

844
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,250
Siren live character for college to the
posers there from a Canada.

845
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,390
Oh my God.
It hoser mean those guys.

846
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,670
I don't know why.
Why hosers learning all these words.

847
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,140
This is great.
Why hoser?

848
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,420
I don't know why that.
I hardly ever use that.

849
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,070
I don't know why it popped up.
I love it.

850
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,080
I want to go back to the.
The PROZAC?

851
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,501
Yeah,
yeah.

852
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:50,490
Yeah.
Because I'm super.

853
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,340
Your parents put you on that stuff when
you're 10 years old.

854
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,610
I think it was more the doctors.
Doctors.

855
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,720
I'm sorry,
your doctors put you on that stuff when

856
00:39:57,721 --> 00:40:00,500
you were 10 years old.
Tests and blood tests.

857
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,060
What do you see a demon?
What do you see?

858
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,260
Death.
What do you see?

859
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:07,470
A skull?
I probably said things like a butterfly

860
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,250
of pitch.
I hate from school with fucking ax in

861
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:15,210
her head.
So the doctor puts you on PROZAC.

862
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:16,740
And what kind of an effect does that
have on you?

863
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,880
I mean,
it actually helped.

864
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,250
It really helped.
I think it helped me.

865
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,240
Um,
gosh,

866
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:25,650
it's so hard to remember too.
I mean,

867
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,870
I was 10,
but when I talked to my parents about

868
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:28,261
it,
they're like,

869
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:30,360
you know,
it did help because I really do think

870
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,880
that because of everything that
happened,

871
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:34,650
you know,
my brain chemistry did shift,

872
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,320
you know,
I do think that we can shift our brain

873
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:39,690
chemistry with repetitive thoughts and
you know,

874
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:42,030
I had enough thoughts about,
you know,

875
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,870
I'm not likable.
I had just intense inner critic in my

876
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:50,040
head and I do think that shifted my
brain chemistry and I do think that the

877
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:53,550
medicine helped me at least get to a
point where,

878
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,280
you know,
I was like kind of awake again.

879
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,300
How long does it take?
I don't remember,

880
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,370
but I know that,
you know,

881
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,980
especially in my twenties,
like I'm still on it.

882
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:06,600
Oh Gosh,
I was on it until 30.

883
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,080
Yeah,
I was on every from every.

884
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:12,410
I was on Prozac,
Wellbutrin

885
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,510
for many years.
20 from the time you were 10.

886
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,040
So all through high school you run that
stuff?

887
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,040
Yep.
Wow.

888
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,501
Yep.
I,

889
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:23,900
I believed that I needed it just like a
diabetic would take insulin.

890
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,950
So how long ago did you get off of it?
A seven and a half years ago.

891
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,080
Wow.
And,

892
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,430
and like totally,
I,

893
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,140
I never have any regression or dips but
I did.

894
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:38,750
I was super intentional about getting
off of it.

895
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,360
I didn't just stop like,
especially after 20 years.

896
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:46,630
It took me a while.
It took a lot of the emotional work that

897
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:51,050
I was doing with my coach Mona because
so much of depression is suppression so

898
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,550
you know,
and all that stuff was happening.

899
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,180
I think I was pretty angry about it but
I had no outlet for that,

900
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,870
especially as a girl like boys again can
go out and get stuff out.

901
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:02,360
But a lot of times,
and this is why I think so many women

902
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,270
get irritable and bitchy and all those
kinds of things is because women,

903
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:07,640
we don't have like that outlet for
anger.

904
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,200
And so we internalize a lot of that.
Like we can do sadness but anger a lot

905
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:17,201
of times gets suppressed.
And so a lot of like me getting off my

906
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,230
medicine and not feeling depressed was
not being suppressed.

907
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Exercise the exercise is okay,
but until you like go back and actually

908
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:28,040
process the emotion.
I mean,

909
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,170
exercise is good in terms of moving the
energy,

910
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,740
but a lot of times you have to attach
like the feeling with the movement,

911
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,440
right?
So like a lot of my retreats that I do

912
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,620
where I just bring women,
I facilitate like an anger barn for

913
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,190
them,
anger,

914
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,103
burn,
what is that?

915
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,450
It's like a safe place for women to get
their anger out.

916
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,190
Like,
and it's not just catharsis,

917
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,860
like there's a whole kind of process I
put them through so they like,

918
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,340
you know,
kind of reconnect maybe earlier life

919
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:58,850
experiences where they didn't feel
protected or they felt unsafe or they

920
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:01,700
felt you know,
abused or whatever that is.

921
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,220
Because again,
like this is just,

922
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:06,770
this all comes from my own life
experience in working with,

923
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,990
Gosh,
thousands of people at this point.

924
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,600
Like I,
I see over and over again.

925
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:14,920
People that are depressed,
shut down,

926
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,420
have a lot of anxiety,
not happy with their life,

927
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,680
have some like,
unprocessed thing from their past that

928
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:26,300
just needs to move.
And when I create this space for people

929
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:31,301
to start to move that energy,
it's like underneath there is creativity

930
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:36,080
and passion and peace and freedom from
anxiety and all that kind of stuff.

931
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:41,470
So when you're looking at me like
he's looking at me like,

932
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,660
who is this girl?
So when people have that space to

933
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:52,400
unleash that and to let the energy move
through them because I think there's a

934
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:57,401
difference between emotion and feelings.
So feelings to me,

935
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,100
our physiological responses to thoughts.
Okay.

936
00:44:01,101 --> 00:44:06,101
So if I sit here and think about the
future of that I'm scared about,

937
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,360
I'm going to feel anxiety.

938
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,460
If I have like,
oh my gosh,

939
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,900
what if someone breaks into my house
tonight,

940
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:13,370
I'm going to feel fear.
You know,

941
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:14,450
if I,
I can,

942
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,300
I can feel regret because of a thought
or guilt.

943
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,330
But,
but emotion like energy in motion,

944
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:25,390
if someone hurts one of your kids,
you're going to experience anger.

945
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,010
You know,
like it's a natural response.

946
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,040
Someone close to us dies or we have a
heartbreak.

947
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,360
It's natural to feel the emotion of
sadness.

948
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,920
And I think that there's a lot of kind
of misleading information about like,

949
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,500
oh,
we create all our feelings with our

950
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:44,040
thoughts and we can just affirm our way
out of things and think our way out of

951
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,470
things.
And to some degree that's true.

952
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,900
Changing our thinking does a lot.
But with,

953
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,690
with some core emotions like anger,
shame,

954
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:54,270
sadness,
I think we got to feel them and I think

955
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:57,570
that that's what people are really
scared of is actually kind of opening

956
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,450
that box,
opening that can of worms and going back

957
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:03,360
and actually feeling those feelings.
But the thing is they're in there.

958
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,330
And so if you don't get them up and out
in a healthy way,

959
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,880
then I think that's what creates a lot
of suppression,

960
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:09,990
a lot of depression,
perhaps,

961
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:12,360
maybe even disease,
things like that because they just get

962
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,760
stored in our body somewhere.
It makes sense.

963
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,150
So what do you do to these gals?

964
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,980
What do I do to these gals?
Um,

965
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,950
I,
it's just creating the space.

966
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,530
They just scream,
well,

967
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:29,790
you know,
it's not a pill.

968
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,920
No,
it's not that I give them.

969
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:33,720
I definitely give them something to hit
with,

970
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:36,850
like in those foam noodles,
you know,

971
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,770
that
I do and oh gosh,

972
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,420
the comments to this are going to be
crazy.

973
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,580
I can't believe this,
but here we go.

974
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:49,730
So I um,
and I put on some pretty intense music

975
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,170
and again,
I don't even know.

976
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,510
Not slayer,
not slayer.

977
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,180
Slayer.
It's more like,

978
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:01,680
it's more like metallica.
Metallica is on my playlist.

979
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:02,780
I'll,
I can pull up my place.

980
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,570
I really want to see it.
Um,

981
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,860
you have a beat the shit out of a foam
roller.

982
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,613
Oh,
for sure.

983
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,331
Yeah,
yeah,

984
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:11,000
yeah.
That's cool.

985
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,880
Anger,
burned platelets.

986
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,110
Anger,
burned playlist.

987
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,890
Yeah.
Well I'm telling you a little bit about

988
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,620
actually.

989
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,220
So one time I was doing this,
I rented a house actually out in the

990
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,310
near here,
a Gaura and people were doing this

991
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:25,080
process and again,
like I prep them,

992
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:25,891
like the,
you know,

993
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:27,360
I,
they,

994
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,850
they bring to mind things that they've
maybe,

995
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:33,090
like I said,
like we're angry about things from their

996
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,100
childhood,
you know,

997
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,960
it's not just like a throw them in a
room with loud music and say go after

998
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:37,860
it.
Like they're very,

999
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,590
there's a lot of processes I put them
through to get them to this point.

1000
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,720
But anyway,
so we're doing this one time in this

1001
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:47,721
house and there's like 20 women,
loud music yelling and um,

1002
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,770
the cops show up
and

1003
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,660
the guy's like,
what do you like,

1004
00:46:57,661 --> 00:46:59,640
what's going on here?
And I step out,

1005
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,830
I stepped out and I explained,
I said,

1006
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,060
you know,
a lot of times I,

1007
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:05,460
this is a women's workshop and a lot of
times,

1008
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:05,710
you know,
we,

1009
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,240
we hold back our emotions and you know,
we ended up getting irritable and it's

1010
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:13,260
just as healthy way for people to,
to heal and work on their emotions.

1011
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,460
And the cop looks at me and he's like,
can I have your card?

1012
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:19,590
I want to send my wife.
No kidding.

1013
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,480
That's what the cop said to me.
So is.

1014
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,220
And I've gotten lots of calls from
husbands and boyfriends and even kids

1015
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:29,770
and like thank you because there's
something about,

1016
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,970
it's like pulling off our armor
honestly.

1017
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:39,090
And there's something about doing like
the deeper work and kind of going to

1018
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:43,090
those scary places that takes a layer
off of us.

1019
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:46,980
I think,
I mean it's similar to plant medicine,

1020
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:51,520
a lot of ways of going to those places
where that are Kinda like,

1021
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,340
hmm,
where you come out the other side and

1022
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:57,310
you have a deeper understanding of,
of yourself.

1023
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,733
Um,

1024
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,160
so by doing something completely
ridiculous and crazy and just letting

1025
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:04,870
loose and all the madness involved with
it,

1026
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:05,970
it's almost like a reset

1027
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,020
for you.
Yeah.

1028
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,173
Yeah.
And it's not,

1029
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,220
again,
like it's facilitated.

1030
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,960
It's not this,
this crazy,

1031
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,670
you know,
people going into screaming,

1032
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,000
it's not fight club.
It's not because there's a difference

1033
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:20,330
between catharsis and like actual
processing stuff,

1034
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,610
but it's just.
And again,

1035
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:27,611
I think we,
we don't really understand emotion to a

1036
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:33,101
certain level and we think that big
emotion is crazy and it's not

1037
00:48:34,701 --> 00:48:36,560
necessarily.
I think what is crazy,

1038
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,630
what makes people crazy is suppressing
it their whole life and trying to manage

1039
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:46,631
it through their mind or through doing
things or through whatever else versus

1040
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:51,680
actually like being willing to look at
those parts of ourselves because we're,

1041
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,880
you know,
we're humans.

1042
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:54,560
We have a mind,
we have emotions,

1043
00:48:54,561 --> 00:48:55,580
we have actions,
we have,

1044
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:56,990
you know,
our spiritual self,

1045
00:48:56,991 --> 00:48:59,210
whatever you want to call that,
like something that's connected to

1046
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:03,620
something bigger than us and I think we
need a holistic approach to really

1047
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,480
change.

1048
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,360
No.
From the time that you decided to get

1049
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:11,470
off of the antidepressants,
did you follow a protocol?

1050
00:49:11,471 --> 00:49:13,570
Did you go to a doctor to discuss it
with them?

1051
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,630
Did you read anything about how to do
that and what advice would you give to

1052
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:19,600
anybody out there that might be
listening that also is going through

1053
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:20,950
that same sort of situation?

1054
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,050
Um,
doctors told me I couldn't do it,

1055
00:49:24,051 --> 00:49:24,320
so yeah,

1056
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,270
definitely good doctors ever stay on and
I'm getting paid exactly.

1057
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,990
Um,
so I had,

1058
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,760
you know,
my coach at the time,

1059
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,830
he was really helpful who more than,
again,

1060
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:37,900
like coaches such like a,
I don't even know what to call her.

1061
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,670
She was,
how did you find her?

1062
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,810
I was dating a guy who was an addict and
complaining about him to girlfriend at

1063
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:51,440
lunch for like the 80th time.
And she said pill.

1064
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,130
No drugs like coke,
alcohol,

1065
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,120
maybe pills and pills to fun times.
Good Times.

1066
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,510
Hollywood.
Super Great.

1067
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,550
Yeah.
I was popping xanax while he was doing

1068
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:06,940
all that.
So anyway,

1069
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,900
I,
I'm,

1070
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,570
I've totally lost my train of thought.
Oh,

1071
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:11,550
how'd you find your coach?
Oh yeah,

1072
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:12,370
yeah.
I had to find a coach.

1073
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,910
So we're sitting at lunch.
I'm talking about this for the 80th time

1074
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,260
and she goes,
I can't,

1075
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,440
I can't listen to this anymore.
I went and saw this kind of cookie woman

1076
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:21,823
go see her.

1077
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:26,980
So and I had been to shrinks my whole
life and I'd never been to like a coach.

1078
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,890
I had always been to therapists and
psychiatrists and so nothing against

1079
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:32,840
therapists and psychiatrists.
They do good work,

1080
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:37,940
but I had kind of like reached my limit
with it and so I go to this woman's

1081
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:40,880
house and she's like totally stuck in
1985,

1082
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,470
like her decor,
her fashion,

1083
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:46,250
everything.
And I sit down and I sit across from her

1084
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,860
and she didn't even see me in a normal
office.

1085
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,420
I think she knew she needed to like
totally get me out of my comfort zone.

1086
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:55,550
So she put me in her son's bedroom with
like these race car bunk beds and I'm

1087
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:56,980
sitting there on this race car,
bunk bed,

1088
00:50:56,981 --> 00:50:58,100
the going,
where am I,

1089
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,310
how did I get here?
And she walks in and she sits in front

1090
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:05,150
of me and it was the first time in my
life and I felt loved by my parents.

1091
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,990
This was the first time in my life I
felt really seen,

1092
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,800
like it was almost uncomfortable.
Like this woman could almost see through

1093
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:14,120
me.
She could see me,

1094
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:17,150
she could really see me and I felt zero
judgment from her,

1095
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:22,210
like zero and although is scary and a
little bit because it was like kind of,

1096
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,670
I felt very vulnerable if there was
something so reassuring about it because

1097
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:33,080
she was the first like practitioner I
had seen that didn't see me as broken.

1098
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,800
She really just saw me and she was the
one that in so many ways helped me over

1099
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:41,810
the years,
get off the medication by teaching me

1100
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:43,640
how to release my emotions.
Um,

1101
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,700
by helping me understand that,
you know,

1102
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,470
bad feelings aren't necessarily bad.
I also got very clear about my diet,

1103
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:55,430
like I got off gluten because a lot of
times gluten can impact brain chemistry.

1104
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:56,810
Um,
I stopped drinking.

1105
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:59,360
I wasn't never a big drinker,
but I stopped drinking for about two

1106
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:03,410
years because alcohol's a depressant.
I'd always been into exercise and

1107
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,200
fitness and eating healthy and
everything like that.

1108
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,680
Um,
and then I also started meditating and

1109
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,820
like finding some kind of connection to
a higher power.

1110
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,350
I didn't really have a name for it at
the time,

1111
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:19,010
but something where I didn't feel like I
was so alone because that was kind of

1112
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,330
one of the scary things about
depression,

1113
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:22,670
you feel you feel alone a lot of the
time.

1114
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,710
And so it was a combination of all of
those things that over time and the

1115
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,650
belief that I could,
I really had to change my belief that I

1116
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,660
could get off of them.
Um,

1117
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,720
so for people that are considering it,
um,

1118
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,010
don't just stop,
like,

1119
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:40,820
it's dangerous just to stop because that
can really mess with your brain

1120
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:45,380
chemistry.
Find somebody who knows something about

1121
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:49,520
this and can put you on a plan,
can help you,

1122
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:51,020
you know,
I'm not a doctor,

1123
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:53,600
I'm not here to get met,
get given medical advice so,

1124
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,370
you know,
consulted doctor.

1125
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,090
Um,
but for me it was number one,

1126
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:03,560
the belief that I could and number two,
finding the people that could really

1127
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:07,760
support me and number three,
making the lifestyle changes that I

1128
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:12,110
needed to make to support it and being
willing to go to that dark,

1129
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:15,530
scary place that I was afraid to go to.

1130
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,920
What do you mean by when you say that
she was the first person who didn't see

1131
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:22,720
you as broken?
Do what do you mean by they all?

1132
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,140
They all saw you as broken

1133
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,850
when,
you know,

1134
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,180
for me,
when I would go to one of these doctors

1135
00:53:32,181 --> 00:53:34,880
or therapists,
I mean they'd see that I was on

1136
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:38,040
medication since I was 10.
And um,

1137
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,360
they kind of relate to me in that way.

1138
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,330
Like as a person?
No,

1139
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:45,070
just more like,
like I had a label,

1140
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,430
you're depressed.
And so that's why they weren't willing

1141
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:50,440
to consider you getting off of the
medication.

1142
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,870
He felt like the medication is a part of
who you are.

1143
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,510
You've got to accept it.
It's a daily thing.

1144
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,190
It's like brushing your teeth.
You're not going to stop.

1145
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:57,851
Yeah,
maybe.

1146
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:59,050
I mean,
I don't even know what they were

1147
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:03,880
thinking and I just know how it felt and
I just did it and it maybe it was

1148
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:05,920
because like at the time I didn't
believe it yet either.

1149
00:54:05,921 --> 00:54:07,240
Maybe I need to someone who believed in
him.

1150
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:11,080
I do think that also the people that
deal with people everyday,

1151
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:14,240
whether you're a psychologist or a
psychiatrist or whatever,

1152
00:54:14,241 --> 00:54:18,190
that you're so inundated with people in
their fucking problems that after a

1153
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:22,410
while you just become overwhelmed and
it's very difficult to see people like

1154
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,220
and have a fresh reset.
Every time you see something like this

1155
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:26,780
is a new person.
Her name is Christine.

1156
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,460
Hey Christine,
what's going on with you?

1157
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,660
Yeah,
I think you're right.

1158
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:31,670
I think it's therapists,
psychiatrists.

1159
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:35,030
They have hard jobs.
Like imagine your whole day is person

1160
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:38,360
after person talking about what's wrong
with their life.

1161
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:42,500
You know that that can be very draining.
Even when I first started as a life

1162
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:44,420
coach and I saw person after person
after person,

1163
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:49,421
I really had to learn not to take that
on and not to let it drain me.

1164
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,440
Um,
so again,

1165
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:54,830
like I have a lot of respect for my
mom's a therapist,

1166
00:54:54,831 --> 00:54:57,710
so I have a lot of respect for
therapists and psychiatrists are very

1167
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:02,711
helpful to me.
I just think for me in my life journey

1168
00:55:03,141 --> 00:55:05,330
and what I wanted,
I,

1169
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,150
I just,
I didn't want to spend the rest of my

1170
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:10,760
life medicated.
I just really didn't.

1171
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,440
So what is the difference between life
on medication and life off medication

1172
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,630
and how long has the process of weaning
herself?

1173
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,370
I mean,
I think it took me,

1174
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:26,780
it took me a good two years to feel like
it was finally kind of out of my system.

1175
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,460
Two years.
How long was it before you were actually

1176
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:31,480
stopping taking it?

1177
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,740
Um,
well I,

1178
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:34,723
I,
Gosh,

1179
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,940
I can't remember exactly,
but I think I,

1180
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:40,260
I probably weaned for a good six months
and then it was like a year and a half

1181
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:42,450
until I felt like it was like cleared
out of my system.

1182
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,110
Wow.
So for six months you slowly wean

1183
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:49,080
yourself off of it and then at the end
of six months you're not taking the

1184
00:55:49,081 --> 00:55:51,540
medication anymore,
but you still feel foggy.

1185
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,440
Like what do you feel?

1186
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,363
Yeah,
I wish it was,

1187
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,620
it was like my system was recalibrating,
you know,

1188
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:58,580
all my brain chemistry was recalibrating
and you know,

1189
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,210
because that stuff affects your brain
chemistry.

1190
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:01,500
It affected my hormones,
like it,

1191
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,140
it just affected a lot.

1192
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,880
So did you take like one pill and then
cut it down to three quarters of a pill?

1193
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:15,020
I did consult to a psychiatrist and um,
they gave me like a winning plan.

1194
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,920
So yeah,
whatever,

1195
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,140
different people,
like it's not a standard thing,

1196
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:21,990
like different psychiatrists will tell
you different things.

1197
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,610
So it depends on what you're on,
how long you've been on it,

1198
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:27,900
which medication you're on,
what the side effects for for it are

1199
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:32,200
those kinds of things.
What does it feel like when you're first

1200
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,250
day?
No pills.

1201
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,140
Do you remember that day?
I remember the first day I woke up and I

1202
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:41,680
felt clear like I felt like scientology
clear.

1203
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,530
I don't want to keep getting kicked out
of here.

1204
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,460
No,
I'm like,

1205
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,970
like,
like it was like out of me and I was

1206
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:53,710
like,
oh my gosh,

1207
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,230
I just felt like a fog and a heaviness
had lifted.

1208
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,230
It just fell.
And I also felt like

1209
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,730
I had deeper access to my creativity,
my intuition and all those things were

1210
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,740
present,
but it was just,

1211
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:11,890
there was just sort of like some white
noise there.

1212
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,580
And I also like for me,
depression manifested as being

1213
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:19,480
incredibly self critical,
like super self critical,

1214
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,920
like this very,
very,

1215
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:24,550
very loud inner critic.
And so that started to lift too.

1216
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:26,260
But again,
I was doing all kinds of other work at

1217
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:27,340
the same time.
You know,

1218
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,880
I was studying with my life coach,
I was getting a master's degree in

1219
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,350
spiritual psychology.
I was,

1220
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,240
what is spiritual psychology?
Yes.

1221
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:36,360
Good question.
So um,

1222
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,580
this place called the University of
Santa Monica and I didn't know anything

1223
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:43,870
about this place but I had been a life
coach and I thought okay,

1224
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:46,840
if I'm helping people with their life,
I've got to know how to help them deal

1225
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:47,674
with their past.

1226
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,880
Like I can't just work on present and
future without like having some skills

1227
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,750
for dealing with your past.
And so I was researching schools.

1228
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:58,600
I thought if I could get a master's
degree in psychology that would help me

1229
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,090
and that would be good for my career and
all those things to have some

1230
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:04,030
credentials.
So I researched and I find this school

1231
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:05,320
and I didn't really know anything about
it.

1232
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:06,250
I'm like,
this is great.

1233
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:09,490
And the spiritual part didn't have
anything to do with any religion or

1234
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:11,380
anything like that.
It was more of the premise of,

1235
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,770
you know,
that traditional psychology is,

1236
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:17,870
is kind of a little bit more about
labels and,

1237
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,380
and spiritual psychology is more people
have the inner resources they need to to

1238
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,700
heal.
And I didn't again,

1239
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,550
didn't know much about it,
show up at this school with my laptop

1240
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:30,070
thinking I'm going to like take notes
and there's going to be lectures,

1241
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,110
but it,
there are no desks.

1242
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,980
It was a highly experiential school.
It's like I said,

1243
00:58:35,981 --> 00:58:40,981
a two year program and in that I really
learned how to um,

1244
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,400
change my belief systems,
heal stuff from my past,

1245
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,700
connect to a part of me because we all
have like our basic self,

1246
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,210
like our conscious part.
But I,

1247
00:58:51,211 --> 00:58:54,230
I believe we also have something deeper
like art,

1248
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,890
we can call it her intuition and we can
call it our gut feeling.

1249
00:58:56,891 --> 00:59:00,430
We can call it our authentic self,
but there's some kind of inner wisdom

1250
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,620
that I think all of us have access to.
And this program really helped me get

1251
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:07,750
more access to that,
that part of me.

1252
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:12,340
So that I could start listening to that
more than my old conditioning.

1253
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:15,040
My old belief system is my old fears
because,

1254
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,680
you know,
when we're born we're kind of this blank

1255
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:22,681
slate and then stuff happens and we
formed these stories about our lives and

1256
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:26,240
who we are and how we get love and how
we get validation and how we get

1257
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:30,770
acceptance and how life works and who we
are and our identity and it's kind of

1258
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:34,820
just a story and we have,
we can change that story,

1259
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,110
but it takes work.

1260
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:41,030
Going back and deconstructing that story
and letting go of some old beliefs that

1261
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:43,250
maybe we've hung onto to create a
different one.

1262
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,000
So that's,
that's what so much of my journey has

1263
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:51,980
been about is kind of looking at what's
the story I've created about my life and

1264
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,390
how can I change it?
Because the story that I had was I'm

1265
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:57,950
depressed.
I'm,

1266
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,900
you know,
have to be achieving all the time.

1267
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,000
Being hard on myself with how I motivate
myself.

1268
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,010
So on and so forth.
I'm constantly rejected

1269
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,260
Blahblahblahblahblah.
And by believing that story,

1270
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:07,940
it was creating results in my life that
align,

1271
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,440
that,
aligned with that.

1272
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,920
And so to create different results,
I had to have a different story to tell.

1273
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:17,790
And so there's this shift that that has
to take place and it's like turning a

1274
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,810
battleship,
right?

1275
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,910
It's not,
it's not a quick thing.

1276
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,800
It takes a long time.

1277
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:23,970
No,
it's,

1278
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:25,920
it's not.
And I think that's another,

1279
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,550
um,
kind of let downs people have when they

1280
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,760
go to a seminar or read one book,
they expected change overnight and it's

1281
01:00:34,861 --> 01:00:35,850
a,
it's a process.

1282
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,900
Do you remember the secret?
I do.

1283
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,120
There was a girl,
I've told this story before,

1284
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:42,790
but she was so nice.
She's friends with my friend Kelly,

1285
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:43,900
Kelly,
Kirsten,

1286
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,150
you know Kelly,
Christian comedian,

1287
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,290
funny girl.
Anyway,

1288
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,960
uh,
she was at the comedy store one night

1289
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,850
and uh,
she was,

1290
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,900
she was talking to Kelly and uh,
I was talking to her and she started

1291
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:59,650
going on about her future,
all the things that she was going to do,

1292
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,350
she was going to be married within a
year.

1293
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:04,750
She was going to have the career that
she wants.

1294
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:07,120
She was going to this and that and that
and this,

1295
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,740
and uh,
I was so confused and she was like,

1296
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,420
I found the secret I'm doing,
you know,

1297
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,330
do you know about the secret?
I go,

1298
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:17,430
oh,
uh,

1299
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,960
the power of positive thinking,
I that kind of thing.

1300
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:21,310
She's like,
it's not just that,

1301
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:22,690
it's not just positive thinking.

1302
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,800
It's like you do create your own future.
You create your own identity,

1303
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:29,410
you create,
you create reality.

1304
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:30,244
I was like,
okay,

1305
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,230
like you sure?
And she's like,

1306
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:33,460
yeah,
I'm sure you know,

1307
01:01:33,461 --> 01:01:34,390
I'm,
I'm positive.

1308
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,530
Okay,
good luck.

1309
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,820
I'm like,
boy,

1310
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,860
the problem with all that stuff,
of course,

1311
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,260
if you've never heard of it,
is what do they,

1312
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,690
what,
what is the term for it?

1313
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,120
They're trying to achieve law of
attraction.

1314
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,010
Yeah.
What,

1315
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,000
what they're trying to achieve is
they're trying to,

1316
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:52,390
like,
you take the photo of your dream house,

1317
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:55,030
you pin it on your wall,
you take a photo of a Ferrari,

1318
01:01:55,031 --> 01:01:57,040
you pin that on the wall.
You're going to get those things.

1319
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,880
The problem is when you watch those
videos,

1320
01:02:00,881 --> 01:02:02,020
when they say,
you know,

1321
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:07,021
I had this photo of my home on the wall,
I had the Ferrari that I wanted,

1322
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,250
I had my dream life.

1323
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,670
Now I have those things.
I,

1324
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:15,070
I made those things happen with
intention and with thought.

1325
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:19,850
Do you know many fucking people have a
photo of a beautiful house on the wall

1326
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,410
and a Ferrari.
And they got no fucking house and they

1327
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,050
got no Ferrari and they never will like
you.

1328
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:29,580
It's,
you're taking it from a biased pool of

1329
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:33,360
successful people who will tell you that
this happened to them.

1330
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:37,680
But there are literally millions of
people who think positive and nothing

1331
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:40,980
ever happens to them.
So this girl who,

1332
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:43,320
um,
was a very nice person,

1333
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:49,160
she came to one of my shows like a year
later and we're hanging out outside and

1334
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,300
I go,
how's everything when you're doing?

1335
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,440
She's like,
well,

1336
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,780
it's really a drag,
you know,

1337
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:58,650
because I was convinced that by this
time I would have all these things,

1338
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,420
but you know,
my dad,

1339
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:01,740
he's still,
you know,

1340
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:04,710
fuck up and this and that and I've got
this problem,

1341
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:06,780
that problem and I just don't understand
it.

1342
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,330
I don't understand it.
I believe that I was so sure.

1343
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,300
And we had this like,
really,

1344
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,700
it was really interesting because she
was like two different people.

1345
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:15,030
I got met her twice,
right.

1346
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:20,031
So I meet her this one time and she's
just a glow with this delusion that now

1347
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,530
she's got it and she's getting.
She was,

1348
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,350
she was,
she thought also that talking about it

1349
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,930
all the time was part of how you affirm
it.

1350
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:29,340
So she was saying,
you know,

1351
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,920
I'm going to be married in a year,
I'm going to do this.

1352
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,920
I'm following the secrets.
She kept saying it and it was.

1353
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,680
And then a year later she was just,
I don't get it.

1354
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,780
It didn't work.
And so we had this sort of heart to

1355
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:42,120
heart about it.
Haven't talked to her again and I don't

1356
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:45,990
know what the hell happened to her,
but I'll never forget it because the two

1357
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:46,880
different people,
the,

1358
01:03:46,881 --> 01:03:48,240
the,
the girl who was like,

1359
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:49,710
it was kind,
kinda crazy.

1360
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,131
Like,
oh,

1361
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:54,660
why I didn't believe in.
And then a year later,

1362
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:59,810
year and a half I think just wasn't
happening and life was still kind of

1363
01:03:59,811 --> 01:04:00,810
shitty.
And she was,

1364
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,280
she couldn't understand why the career
didn't happen and alive didn't happen.

1365
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:08,340
And it's,
is all,

1366
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,260
it's a slow shift.

1367
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:14,650
It's a slow shift.
And I think the law of attraction can be

1368
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,930
misleading because it's more,
you know,

1369
01:04:16,931 --> 01:04:21,931
change takes more than I put a picture
up and I do some positive affirmations

1370
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:28,080
if like down deep you don't feel like
you're worthy or you're,

1371
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,180
you're not going to be able to attract
those things.

1372
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:35,170
You've got to like Kinda go back and
deal with core issues and core belief

1373
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,660
systems in order to shift things in your
life.

1374
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,850
I mean,
if it was as easy as putting pictures up

1375
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:41,740
on our wall,
everybody would have,

1376
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,870
you know,
lamborghinis and hot and wives and

1377
01:04:43,871 --> 01:04:44,710
husbands.
So,

1378
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,730
but it,
it takes,

1379
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,940
it takes more than that,
it takes being willing to like do some

1380
01:04:48,941 --> 01:04:53,620
work and take some responsibility rather
than just thinking the universe is Santa

1381
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,350
Claus and just going to pop something
into your life

1382
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:00,220
to people that are morbidly obese that
want a six pack,

1383
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,920
like it can be done,
can be done.

1384
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:06,820
But God damn you got a long road.
You know,

1385
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:09,910
if you want to climb Mount Everest and
you're starting in Santa Monica,

1386
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,680
you gotTa fucking get to Mount Everest.
Absolutely.

1387
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,230
Absolutely.
And then that's when people ask me,

1388
01:05:15,231 --> 01:05:16,880
how'd you get off antidepressants?
I'm not like,

1389
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,720
oh well I just did this and then I did
this and then I this,

1390
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:22,600
it was a,
it was years of like,

1391
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,960
you know,
deciding I was going to and having the

1392
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:27,370
right people around.
It wasn't,

1393
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,650
it wasn't an easy thing.
It's probably the hardest thing I've

1394
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:30,484
done.
No.

1395
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:33,790
Now what is the difference between
antidepressants and Xanax?

1396
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,250
Like when you're taking.
You said you were taking both.

1397
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,280
Yeah.
Why do you need the Xanax if you're

1398
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:40,060
already pilled up on the
antidepressants?

1399
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,030
I mean,
again,

1400
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:43,490
not an MD,
so not my territory,

1401
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:47,600
but for me like I,
the antidepressants just kind of kept me

1402
01:05:47,601 --> 01:05:52,601
steady but then with my boyfriend at the
time and my crazy Hollywood life,

1403
01:05:53,781 --> 01:05:56,780
like I just had so much anxiety and you
know,

1404
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,320
you go to a doctor and you're like,
I have so much anxiety though.

1405
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,580
Do you want to or how do you define
anxiety?

1406
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,580
Worried.
Worried,

1407
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,020
worried a lot.
Like kind of high,

1408
01:06:06,021 --> 01:06:09,020
strong.
I'm not able to calm down.

1409
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,670
Um,
yeah,

1410
01:06:10,671 --> 01:06:13,040
just that.
Just normal,

1411
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:15,140
like anxiety,
but I didn't have tools.

1412
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:20,141
Then my tools then we're medicine
now had better tools.

1413
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:25,340
So now do,
do you take anything?

1414
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:25,820
Nope.

1415
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,330
And supplements,
supplements,

1416
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,930
vitamins and stuff?
Yeah.

1417
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:34,230
I'm super like I love human hacking and
human optimization.

1418
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,940
I'm,
I love exercising.

1419
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:38,790
I love meditation.
Meditation.

1420
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,470
I take Alpha brain,
like all that stuff.

1421
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,190
And you,
do you ever miss it?

1422
01:06:43,191 --> 01:06:44,730
Like is there ever a time we like God
dammit.

1423
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,890
Popping Xanax and fucking glasses?

1424
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,720
No,
no.

1425
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,730
I will say this though,
when I had my eyes,

1426
01:06:50,731 --> 01:06:54,060
lasix lace Vino,
the Lasik and they gave me,

1427
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,100
um,
value.

1428
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,970
And how's this?
I see why people get addicted to this.

1429
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,480
This is incredible.
I'm glad they did because I was super

1430
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,780
freaked out about them cutting my
eyeball open and value them.

1431
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:09,930
Just relax as you rise.
I would've felt great and then the only

1432
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:11,310
time I ever did it.
But no,

1433
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:15,980
I don't miss that because what I have
now is um,

1434
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:21,090
like I,
I feel clear and alive and you don't

1435
01:07:21,091 --> 01:07:23,370
feel happy all the time.
I definitely have my days,

1436
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:26,460
but I don't relate to it as I'm
depressed.

1437
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,871
It's just like,
oh,

1438
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,280
I'm having a normal.
Like,

1439
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:31,080
you know,
human experience not having the best.

1440
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:33,630
I think stories like there's a very
inspiring to people.

1441
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:36,540
I think it's very important.
We don't want.

1442
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,550
It's,
it's like it's hard for people to look

1443
01:07:38,551 --> 01:07:42,330
at people who aren't doing well and talk
to them and just go,

1444
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,700
oh,
I don't know what to tell you a good

1445
01:07:44,701 --> 01:07:45,810
luck.
Let me get the fuck away from this

1446
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:46,421
bitch.
You know,

1447
01:07:46,421 --> 01:07:48,690
like that's how people think.
Like I don't want to deal with her.

1448
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:50,720
Problems are.
His problems are I,

1449
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:53,230
I wanna,
I wanna I want to separate my and

1450
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,480
concentrate on myself.
So I think when someone like you can

1451
01:07:57,481 --> 01:08:01,740
sort of express how you were in this
really bad state and yours is a very

1452
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:06,360
bizarre situation because you're talking
about being on these pills from the time

1453
01:08:06,361 --> 01:08:07,460
you're 10.
Right.

1454
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,990
That's,
that's really unique.

1455
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,850
But then having almost a decade off of
them,

1456
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:13,210
seven years off of them is.

1457
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

1458
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:15,380
I'm state.
Yeah.

1459
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:17,290
And it's,
I,

1460
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,770
I honestly think
it helps me help people.

1461
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,280
Like it really does.
I've had lots of training as a life

1462
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:27,740
coach,
but my own life experiences have been

1463
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:31,190
the thing that's really given me the
most creative.

1464
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,580
Sure.
I guess you could say,

1465
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,980
what are your credentials are that
you're actually happy.

1466
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,240
Yeah.
I'm actually happy I,

1467
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,193
you know,
I,

1468
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:42,880
I've been able to create a life and a
career and friendships and connection

1469
01:08:42,881 --> 01:08:43,900
that,
you know,

1470
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,870
I thought I no longer live that story of
the I hate Christine Club.

1471
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:48,400
I have great friends,
great women friends,

1472
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:49,720
like all of that,
you know,

1473
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:50,610
and,
and that's,

1474
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,040
I know,
like different or more special than

1475
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,360
anybody.
It's just again,

1476
01:08:55,390 --> 01:09:00,390
choices and I made choices that led me
to this point and everybody has that.

1477
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,200
Everybody has that freedom.
What's the book?

1478
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,280
Man's search for meaning.
Have you ever read that book by Viktor

1479
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,091
Frankl?
He was,

1480
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:13,240
yeah,
he was in concentration camps and he was

1481
01:09:13,241 --> 01:09:14,650
actually a psychiatrist,
I think,

1482
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,570
but he talked about,
you know,

1483
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:20,740
he kept himself saying and he kept
himself free through his mind and he

1484
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:25,720
says in between stimulus and response,
basically what happens and how we

1485
01:09:25,721 --> 01:09:28,510
respond is a choice.
And in that choice lies our ultimate

1486
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:31,090
freedom.
And I think that that's true.

1487
01:09:31,091 --> 01:09:33,010
That's,
that's what we all have.

1488
01:09:33,011 --> 01:09:35,530
That freedom,
no matter what your circumstances.

1489
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,270
No.
When someone comes to you and they're

1490
01:09:37,271 --> 01:09:37,851
like,
Christina,

1491
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:40,040
I'm all fucked up.
I need to get my shit together.

1492
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,760
Like,
how do you,

1493
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:46,220
uh,
how do you start with somebody?

1494
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,170
It's different,
you know,

1495
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,650
everybody's different.
But is there anything that people are

1496
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:53,320
universally could benefit from Missouri?

1497
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

1498
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:00,680
The number one thing that where I start
with people is having them really look

1499
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:05,520
at their relationship with themselves
because when they come they're like,

1500
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:06,241
oh,
I'm fucked up,

1501
01:10:06,241 --> 01:10:09,090
or I need help.
They're relating to themselves as if

1502
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:11,010
something's,
something's wrong with them and they're

1503
01:10:11,011 --> 01:10:14,160
being really hard on themselves and
they've kind of lost hope and lost

1504
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:18,250
belief in themselves.
So the first thing is just like

1505
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,780
acceptance,
accepting where you are because you

1506
01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:22,390
know,
I had,

1507
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:24,300
I haven't liked everything that's
happened to me,

1508
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:27,780
but one of the main raise I've been able
to move through it is because I stopped

1509
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:29,700
fighting it.
Isn't that like in martial arts,

1510
01:10:29,701 --> 01:10:31,830
if a punch comes at you,
you're not supposed to resist it.

1511
01:10:31,831 --> 01:10:33,570
You're supposed to kind of move with it.

1512
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,520
Yeah.
Move away from it or roll with it,

1513
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:36,210
roll with it.
Right.

1514
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:39,900
So that's like your teeth,
your teeth and taking on a job.

1515
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:40,710
Exactly.

1516
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,240
And in life we kind of do that where
like,

1517
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,170
oh,
I don't want this break up,

1518
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:44,550
I don't want this layoff.
We resist it,

1519
01:10:44,551 --> 01:10:46,260
we fight it.
And so it's like,

1520
01:10:46,261 --> 01:10:48,480
can we just get to acceptance of
playing?

1521
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,480
Where are you are who you are and what's
happening right now?

1522
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,880
Perspective and perspective.
Yeah.

1523
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,670
And when you can get to that neutral
place,

1524
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,850
that's when you can start doing the work
and that's when you can start doing

1525
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:02,460
different things.
And then the second thing is I ask

1526
01:11:02,461 --> 01:11:04,740
people like,
do you believe you can shift?

1527
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:09,300
Do you believe that you have the power
to make different choices and change and

1528
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:11,790
you don't have to know how that's,
that's my job.

1529
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:14,850
I'll help you with the how.
But you've got to believe you can

1530
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,470
because if we don't believe it's
possible for us.

1531
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:21,390
And it's really hard to make any kind of
change in our life.

1532
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:23,873
Yeah,
that is,

1533
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,270
that is giant.
But how does someone believe,

1534
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,450
like how do you get someone to believe
that they can make change?

1535
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,510
Like do they have to see evidence in
themselves?

1536
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,290
Do you,
is there like do you recommend like

1537
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:42,000
attempting things or tasks or hobbies
or.

1538
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:45,010
Well,
a lot of times it's going back to a time

1539
01:11:45,011 --> 01:11:49,390
in your life where you did take a chance
or you did do something that was a

1540
01:11:49,391 --> 01:11:52,120
stretch in some way,
like everybody has times in their life

1541
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,780
where they've done something they
weren't completely sure they could do

1542
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:00,700
even if it's just a little thing and
everybody has that reference point they

1543
01:12:00,701 --> 01:12:02,770
can go back to,
but a lot of this joe,

1544
01:12:02,771 --> 01:12:07,771
like honestly a lot of it is taking a
leap of faith and I,

1545
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:12,370
I've taken a lot of those and I've
wanted to know the answer and I've

1546
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:16,150
wanted to know like 100 percent that
this would be guaranteed.

1547
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:19,140
Like if I take this leap of faith,
everything will work out and they

1548
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:21,430
haven't always been 100 percent
guarantees,

1549
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:25,300
but it was in taking that leap and
taking that chance and having little

1550
01:12:25,301 --> 01:12:30,100
faith that things started showing up and
things started shifting and that's what

1551
01:12:30,101 --> 01:12:33,880
started to create the evidence.
And it's a tricky thing because I think

1552
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:36,460
people want evidence before they make
change.

1553
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:40,990
But you have to start making these
little changes to start having the

1554
01:12:40,991 --> 01:12:43,660
evidence show up.
I don't know if I answered your

1555
01:12:43,661 --> 01:12:44,140
question.

1556
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,310
No,
that does make sense.

1557
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,320
Um,
I,

1558
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:49,780
I've often said that very difficult
tasks,

1559
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,510
like a,
anything that's difficult that you do,

1560
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:56,070
it gives you the confidence that you can
overcome adversity.

1561
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,010
You can,
you can,

1562
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,140
whether it's I'm a martial art thing or
something along those lines or marathon

1563
01:13:02,141 --> 01:13:04,570
running or anything.
When you do something like that,

1564
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:09,050
these incremental changes happen where
you push yourself through things and

1565
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,780
you,
especially if you can achieve a goal,

1566
01:13:10,781 --> 01:13:13,130
if you could set out to do something,
you achieve that goal.

1567
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:15,040
Like,
I'm going to run a marathon by the end

1568
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,600
of this year.
I don't know why I keep saying marathon,

1569
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:20,800
but you know what I'm saying?
Doing things along those lines.

1570
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:24,400
They can be motivating factors that they
can help push you.

1571
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,850
They can be the engine that starts to
push things in a positive direction.

1572
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:30,020
Can you start to believe in yourself and
you start to believe,

1573
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,280
oh wow.
Like,

1574
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,310
I can do this.
I can take this step.

1575
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,070
You know,
I often tell people that show up or come

1576
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:40,220
to workshop where I'm like,
just that fact that you're here is proof

1577
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,910
that you believe you can change because
like you wouldn't have shown up if some

1578
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:46,510
part of you was in,
you know,

1579
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,380
kind of certain that you could

1580
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:49,870
have you ever had someone come to you,
you're like,

1581
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,090
I can't even help this dude.
The girl.

1582
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:53,810
Not yet.
No.

1583
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:55,270
Do you get mostly dudes or girls?

1584
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,700
Well,
I only coach a few people now.

1585
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:00,160
Um,
my retreats are mostly women.

1586
01:14:00,161 --> 01:14:04,030
My private clients both.
And then like courses and stuff.

1587
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,220
How can we have retreats that are all
women?

1588
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,090
Well,
I know,

1589
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:10,910
I know I'm going to get,
I'm going to do one that will be both

1590
01:14:10,911 --> 01:14:14,140
men and women soon and it's like a
recipe for danger.

1591
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:16,780
Too much depressed people hump it in the
woods or wherever we go.

1592
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,220
The first one that everybody's
depressed.

1593
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:23,221
Some people come just to grow and not
out in the woods

1594
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:30,520
or out in the woods.
That's amazing.

1595
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,350
No,
I like to do it in places like Bali and

1596
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:37,351
Costa Rica jungle.
Oh my gosh.

1597
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,720
I finally,
for people at this,

1598
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,310
this might be able to some people,
so I,

1599
01:14:45,311 --> 01:14:48,190
whenever I go to anywhere tropical,
I get eaten alive,

1600
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:51,280
like eaten alive no matter what other
people have three bites,

1601
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:54,340
I'll have 400.
I finally figured out B one,

1602
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,600
vitamin B,
one,

1603
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,160
two.
It's totally stopped.

1604
01:14:57,161 --> 01:15:01,480
It really have to find it.
Like you can't take a b complex.

1605
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,490
It's vitamin B One,
Huh?

1606
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,040
And it's for some reason stops in
mosquitoes and bug bites.

1607
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,990
Um,
why why B One?

1608
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,640
I have no idea.
I just know it works for me.

1609
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,040
Does something to change your smell?
I don't know.

1610
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,260
It just worked.
It was my salvation.

1611
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,830
I was so happy.
They don't bite you at all I little bit,

1612
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,980
but again it went from being eaten alive
to just getting a few.

1613
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,590
Did you ever try thermacell?
No.

1614
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,350
What's that?

1615
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:31,740
Thermo cell is a device that a lot of
people take when they go camping.

1616
01:15:31,741 --> 01:15:33,090
Things along those lines.
You,

1617
01:15:33,091 --> 01:15:35,400
um,
it's like a,

1618
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,480
it looks like almost like a radio and it
has these little pads and these slide

1619
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:44,481
these pads into this heating element.
And this very fine mist comes out of

1620
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:47,010
this heating element.
You can put it on the ground near you

1621
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,370
and the bugs won't come with an 18 foot
circle.

1622
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,150
Yeah,
yeah.

1623
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:54,900
They use it when you're hunting and
you're in the woods because if you're,

1624
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,070
if you're in the woods,
like,

1625
01:15:56,071 --> 01:16:00,960
especially in Alaska or Alberta,
I don't know if you've ever been Alaska

1626
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:05,490
in the summer.
The mosquitoes are insane because they

1627
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:07,260
own their only alive for a month.

1628
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,430
Oh,
so that is good at town,

1629
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,880
like rabid Barbara,

1630
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,920
Berrien mosquitoes like me and my friend
Ari went fishing in Alaska and it was so

1631
01:16:15,961 --> 01:16:18,720
crazy that you would get out of the car.
We pulled up to this,

1632
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,710
uh,
this stream.

1633
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:23,130
You get out of the car,
you open the door and then won't,

1634
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,270
you're hit with a cloud of mosquitoes.
We jumped back in the car and shut the

1635
01:16:27,271 --> 01:16:30,120
door and we were in the car with like 50
mosquitoes were like,

1636
01:16:30,121 --> 01:16:33,690
what in the fuck is going on?
So then we're spraying ourselves all the

1637
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,000
spray,
all these toxic chemicals.

1638
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:40,950
Hell Dad found out about thermo sells.
Thermo cells just cleans it out.

1639
01:16:40,951 --> 01:16:43,030
Totally easy to travel with their.
Yeah,

1640
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:44,370
they don't even.
They're really light.

1641
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,980
It doesn't even smell.
I mean barely smells,

1642
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,440
but bugs don't want to have anything to
do with it.

1643
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,100
Mosquitoes don't want to have anything
to do with it without thermo cells like

1644
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,140
hanging out in the woods,
like sitting in a spot.

1645
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:59,100
It's almost unbearable unless you have
mosquito netting and you don't want to

1646
01:16:59,101 --> 01:17:02,490
wear like all that.
The mosquito bug spray stuff where your

1647
01:17:02,491 --> 01:17:05,130
skin is in Oregon,
you know all that stuff that you're

1648
01:17:05,131 --> 01:17:07,620
putting on your skin.
It is just not good.

1649
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,040
It's not.
I was deet my first couple

1650
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,470
of days on my last trip and I started
getting sick and I'm like,

1651
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:13,580
I can't.
This is like,

1652
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:15,950
what am I doing?
You're processing and with your liver,

1653
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,380
from your skin,
it gets in your bloodstream.

1654
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:19,211
Terrible.
Yeah.

1655
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:21,920
I mean I'm sure there's probably some
nontoxic alternatives,

1656
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:25,790
but they probably don't work there now,
so it worked for me.

1657
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,270
Hey,
b one,

1658
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:29,660
you hear it.
I've heard that before.

1659
01:17:29,661 --> 01:17:31,970
A friend of mine was telling me that
about Africa.

1660
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,820
They went to Africa and they took a
bunch of b vitamins.

1661
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,890
The B one in particular did it for me
find anything on that journey.

1662
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,250
I found something that said that studies
are inconclusive,

1663
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:45,110
but it may make mosquitoes.
Thank you.

1664
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:46,430
Stink.
Good.

1665
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,650
Perfect.
Good.

1666
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,870
It's fine for me.
I wonder if it's like a vitamin that

1667
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:55,590
makes people think you smell good.
People are mosquitoes people.

1668
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,520
Yeah.
Because if bananas don't Eat Bananas for

1669
01:17:58,521 --> 01:17:59,880
Ms Dot Susan,
don't eat bananas.

1670
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:02,410
That makes sense to it.
But I would think that like,

1671
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,550
like this probably like weird smells
that you're not even sure you detect you

1672
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:09,370
now.
Some people just give off a weird odor

1673
01:18:09,371 --> 01:18:10,220
to people.
Yes.

1674
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,370
I mean not even like a,
maybe not older,

1675
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:16,120
older,
but like they just feel weird,

1676
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,670
you know,
they said that.

1677
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,380
Um,
Chris Ryan,

1678
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,910
my friend who's um,
um,

1679
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,280
he,
he's an author,

1680
01:18:24,281 --> 01:18:27,460
he wrote a sex at dawn.
He's great,

1681
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,380
super smart,
super smart guy.

1682
01:18:29,381 --> 01:18:34,381
He was telling me that there's certain
odors that human beings have and those

1683
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:39,430
odors enable people to understand
whether or not they're genetically

1684
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:43,840
compatible with each other and you know,
like they used to be when we were kids.

1685
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:48,250
I used to always hear about couples
taking blood tests to make sure that

1686
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:50,430
they could have babies together.
Yeah.

1687
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,330
That was a thing.
That was a thing.

1688
01:18:52,331 --> 01:18:53,830
They would,
they would make sure that they were

1689
01:18:53,831 --> 01:18:55,550
compatible and I don't even know if
there was.

1690
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:59,530
It was real science behind it,
but they would take blood tests to find

1691
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:01,310
out they were compatible.
That was like,

1692
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:05,230
I remember it being like really common
to discuss.

1693
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:09,070
I mean it was this is a the eighties or
the nineties or whatever the fuck.

1694
01:19:09,071 --> 01:19:11,620
It was the dark ages of science,
but for me it was that easy.

1695
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,470
Right.
But not compatible.

1696
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:17,290
Obviously personality wise and all the
other things that come into play.

1697
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:18,870
But they were.
He.

1698
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:24,030
Chris Ryan was saying that women can
smell a man's clothes,

1699
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:29,710
like you could smell,
literally smell their clothes and they

1700
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:34,330
would know whether or not they would be
attracted to that person based on the

1701
01:19:34,331 --> 01:19:37,180
smell that per person is getting.
Not Not like,

1702
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,290
oh my God,
this guy stinks,

1703
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:43,480
but like literally like you,
your body knows what's repulsive and

1704
01:19:43,481 --> 01:19:45,640
what's not repulsive in terms of
genetics,

1705
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,610
based on someone's odor that they give
off on their clothes,

1706
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,730
but what it didn't work is when they put
women on the pill,

1707
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:56,380
so when they put women on the pill,
they were no longer able to

1708
01:19:56,381 --> 01:20:00,070
differentiate whether or not someone was
genetically compatible by smelling them

1709
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,840
that it gave you.

1710
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:06,730
It fogged up your,
your natural senses because I think when

1711
01:20:06,731 --> 01:20:09,090
you're on pill you don't actually
ovulate.

1712
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:12,240
Right?
So you're not in the natural rhythm of

1713
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,150
biology.
Yeah,

1714
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:18,240
I think there's a natural feeling that
women have when they're around a guy

1715
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:21,460
that they would breed with or a guy they
wouldn't breed with like,

1716
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,500
okay,
gotTa go,

1717
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,490
you know,
like that.

1718
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,510
And that is probably a good thing.
And the people that are on the pill

1719
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:30,430
might be making like really shitty
genetic choices,

1720
01:20:30,431 --> 01:20:32,640
like literally genetic choices.
Ah,

1721
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:36,450
you can blame your last bad ex boyfriend
on being on the pill.

1722
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,540
You could smell them accurately.
I really think you can.

1723
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,830
I mean,
it totally makes sense.

1724
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,930
I probably.
Chris has probably listening right now

1725
01:20:42,931 --> 01:20:45,030
go and you fucked it up.
I probably did,

1726
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:50,420
but I think there's probably something
to instinctual reactions to people.

1727
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:53,700
I mean,
have you ever met someone who,

1728
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,520
for whatever reason,
I just don't want to be around this

1729
01:20:56,521 --> 01:21:00,810
person and then you find out years later
that that person is fucking crazy or

1730
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:01,644
this or that.

1731
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:05,400
There's,
I think people give off in detectable in

1732
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:07,980
terms of like what we classify as
smells,

1733
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:12,180
but maybe these pheromones have some
sort of a weird reaction to your birth

1734
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:14,040
control pills affects women's taste in
men.

1735
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,450
Bam.
Wow.

1736
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:19,350
How synthetic hormones changed desires
and women and their choice of a mate

1737
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,290
intimate.
Yeah,

1738
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,250
totally.
Makes Sense.

1739
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:25,250
Interesting.
Yeah.

1740
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,690
Well it just makes sense.
I mean,

1741
01:21:26,691 --> 01:21:29,190
it just can't be.
Nor your body must be so confused.

1742
01:21:29,191 --> 01:21:31,610
Like this pitch is pregnant all the
time.

1743
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,230
I know.
That's what it thinks.

1744
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:36,140
Your body thinks you're pregnant all the
time now.

1745
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:40,980
That's the pill scares me too.
Just synthetic hormones pumping through

1746
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:42,180
your system.
Yeah.

1747
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,750
Camp can't be all that good to never get
off,

1748
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:48,720
but a lot of women never get off it
right there on it forever.

1749
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:49,530
Yep.
Yeah.

1750
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,690
I don't like it.
It makes my hair oily when I'm off at.

1751
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,670
Yup.
Here's stuff like that.

1752
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,440
There's other ways to balance your
hormones.

1753
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,910
You know,
I'm not a hormone specialist,

1754
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:59,610
but why does hormones make a girl's hair
oily?

1755
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,980
I don't know.
I have no idea.

1756
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:05,910
How do we get on the subject?
Smells.

1757
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,250
Retreats.
You don't take dudes.

1758
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,100
Dudes on retreats.
Yeah.

1759
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,940
I would think they're like getting a
bunch of people that are trying to get

1760
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:14,220
their life together and then having them
all together.

1761
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:17,790
Male and female.
Do you run into these weird issues?

1762
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:18,500
Were

1763
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,080
anything that really just trying to hook
up?

1764
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:20,891
Yeah,
exactly.

1765
01:22:20,891 --> 01:22:22,780
You can get really distracted and you
can get,

1766
01:22:22,781 --> 01:22:27,070
like if there's some kind of attraction,
you can forget what you're there for and

1767
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:30,610
get obsessed with someone and,
and it can kind of throw off the thing

1768
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:33,250
and there's something too about,

1769
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,180
you know,
women coming together with women and men

1770
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:38,130
coming together with men that I think is
important.

1771
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,310
And I think kind of back to that tribal
conversation we need,

1772
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:45,720
I got a lot of women including myself,
have beef with other women,

1773
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,670
you know,
and they don't like being around just a

1774
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:50,380
bunch of other women.
Like there's competition that comes up

1775
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:54,150
and Oh,
well I used to because I was scared of

1776
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:56,280
other women because I had all that stuff
happen.

1777
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,020
I didn't really trust it.
Um,

1778
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:00,120
and so when you get a group of women
together,

1779
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:03,360
a lot of times there is that like
comparison and judgment and I can't

1780
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:05,970
trust into that.
And so it's important for women,

1781
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,990
I think to gather together and kind of
do work separately from when there's men

1782
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:14,950
there because there's something that is
very healing just in that.

1783
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,210
And then,
you know,

1784
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:18,310
it just,
there's a level of vulnerability that's

1785
01:23:18,311 --> 01:23:20,740
possible when there aren't men.

1786
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,770
They're not to say that you can't be
vulnerable with men there,

1787
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:26,210
but it's just a different dynamic.
And I think the same goes for men,

1788
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:30,790
like I know men who do men's groups and
men's work and there's great value in

1789
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:34,840
that and that's important.
And I think one of the problems I see a

1790
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:39,490
lot in intimate relationships is that in
a heterosexual relationship is that you

1791
01:23:39,491 --> 01:23:42,760
expect this one person to be your
everything and you're not.

1792
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,310
You don't have a tribe and you don't
have a community,

1793
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:48,610
you don't have friends of the opposite
sex in the same sex that are fulfilling

1794
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:52,150
kind of these needs that we all have.
We just project like this.

1795
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:55,690
My one person has to be my everything,
my soul mate.

1796
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,100
And so,
you know,

1797
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:58,990
having your community,
whatever it may be,

1798
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:00,610
and having different friends I think is
super,

1799
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:02,710
super important to having a healthy
relationship.

1800
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,980
Yeah,
having friends period is super

1801
01:24:04,981 --> 01:24:06,720
important.
There is something that I tweeted today

1802
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:08,940
that I was reading about,
um,

1803
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:14,180
they were talking about the role that
genetics and family have in creating a

1804
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:19,221
personality and how much of an impact
your peers have and they think that your

1805
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:24,471
peers and the friends you choose have a
bigger impact than anything in your

1806
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,540
life.
And it was really fascinating.

1807
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:29,130
I,
I tweeted this morning on it,

1808
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,220
but it's,
it's one of those articles where you

1809
01:24:32,221 --> 01:24:33,630
read it and you go,
oh,

1810
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:38,250
that completely makes sense.
Researcher argues that peers are much

1811
01:24:38,251 --> 01:24:41,790
more important than parents,
that psychologists underestimate the

1812
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:45,840
power of genetics and that we have a lot
to learn from Asian classrooms.

1813
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:47,470
Interesting.
Yeah.

1814
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,020
What about it?
What about Asian classrooms to go down

1815
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:52,230
and scroll?
Forgot what that was about.

1816
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,230
I don't know,
probably too long of an article to

1817
01:24:55,231 --> 01:24:56,950
really get into it,
but um,

1818
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:57,903
would have to read it.

1819
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:03,170
But peers in general,
I think I'm choosing likeminded folks

1820
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:05,850
and choosing people that are on a good
path.

1821
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:06,950
They,
it,

1822
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:11,730
it helps support you and it supports
them and you feed off of each other.

1823
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,590
And when the tribe does well,
you do well.

1824
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,860
Exactly.
This is very,

1825
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,090
very critical and people,
everybody wants to be the person that's

1826
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:21,360
accomplishing things.
Everybody wants to be the one that's out

1827
01:25:21,361 --> 01:25:23,430
there.
Go get knit and fuck the world's all

1828
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:25,500
about me.
But if you do that,

1829
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,150
you like,
you're gonna,

1830
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:29,520
you're gonna mess up the whole happiness
thing.

1831
01:25:29,521 --> 01:25:33,750
Like the happiness thing comes with all
the people that you're around having a

1832
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:34,450
good time.

1833
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:36,040
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1834
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:40,000
And then it's just like,
it's endless.

1835
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:44,230
You have to keep upping the ante.
And I think what we want more than

1836
01:25:44,231 --> 01:25:47,110
anything is connection.
Connection.

1837
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:51,170
We want love,
we want to feel like we belong to.

1838
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:53,440
So I think belonging is a huge,
huge,

1839
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:57,430
huge thing.
And I think as adults we think we belong

1840
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,110
by,
you know,

1841
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,170
achieving things.
But really it's finding those people

1842
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,040
that you can just be yourself

1843
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,910
with and to have that tribe and also let
go of the people that are bringing you

1844
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:11,210
down.
Like I've outgrown some people in my

1845
01:26:11,211 --> 01:26:13,160
life and some friends.
Not that I'm better than,

1846
01:26:13,161 --> 01:26:16,850
but I'm just on like a different,
different path and a different route and

1847
01:26:16,851 --> 01:26:20,510
it's important I think to kind of know
like who's the sort of dead weight and

1848
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:24,110
your life and what are some friendships
that might have reached their expiration

1849
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:25,740
date that you know,
like,

1850
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,590
I love you,
that's been great,

1851
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:28,520
but you know,

1852
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,360
and a lot of those friendships,
like you're not helping them either.

1853
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,130
No.
Matter of fact,

1854
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:35,680
sometimes when someone cuts you loose,
you go,

1855
01:26:35,681 --> 01:26:36,910
wow,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

1856
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,710
They don't need to look at myself.
Right.

1857
01:26:38,711 --> 01:26:40,930
I mean sometimes when you enable a
friend,

1858
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,960
you're not only,
you're not doing yourself any good,

1859
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,520
you're not doing them any good either.

1860
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,600
Exactly.
That was a big Aha for me when my fiance

1861
01:26:51,301 --> 01:26:54,840
broke up with me because I very much
wanted to be the victim in that,

1862
01:26:54,841 --> 01:26:56,520
but I had to look at,
Gosh,

1863
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:59,250
what did I like?
What did I do?

1864
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,061
Because everybody's like,
oh,

1865
01:27:00,061 --> 01:27:03,630
he's such a jerk,
but I really had to look at how was I

1866
01:27:03,631 --> 01:27:08,631
showing up in that relationship that was
impacting his decision because he wasn't

1867
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:11,490
a bad guy.
Like he wasn't just a jerk who decided,

1868
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,110
you know,
I'm going to break up with this girl.

1869
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:17,910
Like there were ways I was showing up
that were like made him make the

1870
01:27:17,911 --> 01:27:20,550
decision that he makes.
So I think in any of those situations,

1871
01:27:20,551 --> 01:27:22,500
friendship or relationship,
you know,

1872
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:23,760
you don't,
you don't want to go too far.

1873
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:25,230
The other extreme and be like,
oh my gosh,

1874
01:27:25,231 --> 01:27:27,870
I'm a loser and think it's all your
fault.

1875
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:30,000
But it's important to look at,
Geez,

1876
01:27:30,001 --> 01:27:31,320
what's my part in this?
You know,

1877
01:27:31,321 --> 01:27:35,370
what's my responsibility?
Because I played a role in this whole

1878
01:27:35,371 --> 01:27:36,204
thing.

1879
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,460
Yeah,
I mean there's no one way street when it

1880
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:42,360
comes to relationship and if you're in a
relationship with a bad person,

1881
01:27:42,361 --> 01:27:45,180
like why?
Why did you get in that in the first

1882
01:27:45,181 --> 01:27:47,720
place?
You know,

1883
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,210
if they did trick you,
you know,

1884
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,850
what did you do when you realized it was
a trick?

1885
01:27:50,851 --> 01:27:52,780
Did you stick around and try to fix it?
Yeah,

1886
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:56,710
I think that's a really good question
because I mean how many people do you

1887
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:59,920
know that are in bad relationships?
Continue talking about it but don't,

1888
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,590
aren't doing anything about it.
Like they're brutal.

1889
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:07,460
They're not leaving it and if people are
brutal are because there's just like

1890
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:11,830
lie,
but a lot of times it's because it's

1891
01:28:11,831 --> 01:28:15,940
familiar and it's date.
What there's somebody said,

1892
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,670
you know,
you get the love you think you deserve

1893
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:22,660
and it may be easy for us looking
outside going,

1894
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:23,590
oh my gosh,
it's so easy.

1895
01:28:23,591 --> 01:28:25,240
You should just like leave this
relationship.

1896
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,790
But a lot of times the person like
doesn't think they can do better.

1897
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:31,600
Or maybe this is like playing out some
dynamic they had with their parent or

1898
01:28:31,601 --> 01:28:33,970
you know,
you sort of need to understand why

1899
01:28:33,971 --> 01:28:37,270
you're in it before you can actually
make the choice to get out of it.

1900
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:39,130
By the way,
there's a lot of delusional people out

1901
01:28:39,131 --> 01:28:41,950
there that are like,
I deserve a lot more than I'm getting.

1902
01:28:41,951 --> 01:28:43,990
That's true.
That's not really there.

1903
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,970
That's true.
What do you do when someone comes to you

1904
01:28:45,971 --> 01:28:50,350
with unrealistic expectations or they
don't want to see themselves like you

1905
01:28:50,351 --> 01:28:50,770
know,
you'd,

1906
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:54,940
you'd tell them what they need to do or
what they should consider and they argue

1907
01:28:54,941 --> 01:28:55,774
with you about it.

1908
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,880
Well,
I just really ask like,

1909
01:28:57,970 --> 01:29:01,800
is what you're doing working like is
your way working?

1910
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,150
You can show me your ways working then.
Great.

1911
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:07,570
My weight is fine.
This is fucking other people.

1912
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,690
Everybody else.
Everybody else is all messed up.

1913
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,710
I'm good.
God Damn it.

1914
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:15,820
Yeah.
I need you to coach everyone else.

1915
01:29:15,821 --> 01:29:16,654
I know.

1916
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,390
Yeah.
If we could just change other people.

1917
01:29:19,391 --> 01:29:21,640
It's everybody else's fault.
Yup.

1918
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,320
Do you ever have to tell people you're
not going to work with them?

1919
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,830
I've had one person I had to tell that
to.

1920
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,370
Yup.
Just one and it was,

1921
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,470
you know,
I think it was,

1922
01:29:32,471 --> 01:29:35,860
it was just not a good fit and she just
wasn't ready.

1923
01:29:35,861 --> 01:29:39,980
Willing.
The super committed to her story and

1924
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,420
sort of wanted me just to cuddle it,
which I wasn't willing to do.

1925
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,160
Yeah.
Sometimes people just want someone to

1926
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:46,450
that.
That's what I've always wondered about

1927
01:29:46,451 --> 01:29:47,860
therapy.
Like I have friends that have been to

1928
01:29:47,861 --> 01:29:48,461
therapy,
I'm like,

1929
01:29:48,461 --> 01:29:49,750
okay,
well what do you do when you go there?

1930
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:52,570
You talk about your problems and one
happens while they give you advice and

1931
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,790
then what happens?
You don't do shit.

1932
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:56,860
You know,
like there's a lot of people that just

1933
01:29:56,861 --> 01:30:00,130
want to go somewhere and once a month to
listen to them talk.

1934
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:01,170
Right?
Right.

1935
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:04,000
They'll go three,
four times a week and they're still

1936
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:05,380
fucked up.
I'm like,

1937
01:30:05,381 --> 01:30:06,790
well,
that isn't working.

1938
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:07,460
Yeah,

1939
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:11,180
it doesn't.
And I think my intention always is to

1940
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:14,750
really give people the tools,
not just advice and really help them

1941
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:16,760
heal really get.
I've had amazing teachers have been

1942
01:30:16,761 --> 01:30:20,060
really,
really lucky and they've really taught.

1943
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:23,330
They haven't just given me advice,
they haven't just given me motivation.

1944
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:28,780
They've really given me tools to heal
and change and that's,

1945
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,440
that's what I try to do in my work with
people is show them that it that a as

1946
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:39,170
possible and they can do it and give
them the tools to do it because that's

1947
01:30:39,171 --> 01:30:41,430
what that's going to last longer than
any kind of like

1948
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,940
pep talk.
It was funny.

1949
01:30:42,941 --> 01:30:46,330
We were talking before the podcast
started about going to a seminar and

1950
01:30:46,331 --> 01:30:50,290
someone asking how many men here feel
vulnerable?

1951
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:54,580
And like no one's putting their hand up.
How many women here feel vulnerable?

1952
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:59,230
All the hands went up,
all the hands went up and I mean,

1953
01:30:59,231 --> 01:31:02,020
part of it I think is a little
delusional because I think a lot of men

1954
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:04,060
are way more vulnerable than they really
think they are.

1955
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:08,580
But also there's just a different thing
going through live.

1956
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:12,280
I mean there's that expression,
the fairer sex or.

1957
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:16,000
But being a female,
being a woman means you are physically

1958
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:16,834
different.
Yup.

1959
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,770
Your roundup,
a bunch of people that most of them

1960
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,520
could beat you up.
Yep.

1961
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:23,920
You know,
that's,

1962
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,200
it's a different way to walk through the
world.

1963
01:31:26,201 --> 01:31:31,201
That vulnerability though is that
creates another level of anxiety,

1964
01:31:31,721 --> 01:31:33,910
right?
Like walking down a dark street,

1965
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:39,090
you see someone and it's a man and he's
walking down a dark street to like,

1966
01:31:39,281 --> 01:31:40,660
Oh,
you know,

1967
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:41,241
yeah.
Um,

1968
01:31:41,241 --> 01:31:44,900
it's,
it's scary and it's something that,

1969
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:45,951
you know,
I,

1970
01:31:45,951 --> 01:31:48,740
as a woman,
like I'm always aware of it.

1971
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,690
Not always,
but a lot of the time,

1972
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,583
you know,
cause I,

1973
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,840
I know that like,
like you said,

1974
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,950
I could get beaten up like it's between
me and a man.

1975
01:31:57,951 --> 01:32:00,160
He's probably gonna win.
I mean I'm pretty strong but

1976
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,270
not that strong and I live.
I think what's also beautiful about

1977
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:07,270
women and just the feminine general is
that vulnerability.

1978
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,610
But because like at sometimes as it
feels safe,

1979
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:13,330
I think that's why a lot of women like
kind of have a protective armor and are

1980
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:17,020
guarded and sometimes more and they're
like masculine energy in the world is

1981
01:32:17,021 --> 01:32:19,300
because on some level we feel like we
have to,

1982
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:23,200
we have to like protect ourselves and
whereas that,

1983
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:27,880
that vulnerability really is the thing
that makes us women in so many ways not.

1984
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:32,620
And I think we confuse vulnerability
with weakness because vulnerability to

1985
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:36,730
me is being open,
being available,

1986
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:40,720
being um,
soft but not weak.

1987
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:45,750
Weakness to me is more about kind of
going into the victimy and going into

1988
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,900
that poor pitiful me and the feeling
sorry for and on all of those kinds of

1989
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:51,480
things.
I think there's beautiful power and

1990
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:53,920
vulnerability,
but when we're talking about just

1991
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,990
physical strength,
yeah,

1992
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,290
I mean for the most part,
men have the advantage on that one.

1993
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:04,060
It's just we need all the pieces,
right?

1994
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:08,800
You need the whole spectrum of human
beings and it.

1995
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,230
I mean,
especially in terms of,

1996
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,870
you know,
the traditional way of looking at

1997
01:33:13,871 --> 01:33:14,531
things.
You know,

1998
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:17,980
masculine men are attracted to feminine
women and Feminine.

1999
01:33:17,981 --> 01:33:21,220
Women are attracted to masculine men and
we both need each other,

2000
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:24,610
but a lot of times,
especially when you're dealing with

2001
01:33:24,611 --> 01:33:29,590
damaged folks,
you're dealing with a man who has a

2002
01:33:29,591 --> 01:33:32,170
vulnerable woman in the man's all fucked
up,

2003
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:36,070
so he takes it out on the vulnerable
woman and the vulnerable woman is like

2004
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,960
under the,
you know,

2005
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:41,530
the,
the pressure of the relationship or the

2006
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:43,780
suppression of being connected to this
man,

2007
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,080
and so you kind of dealing with the same
dynamic that you were dealing with when

2008
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:52,000
you were in school or someone's bullying
you and you get it in this relationship.

2009
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:56,590
Then instead of someone appreciating you
for the difference in the softness

2010
01:33:56,591 --> 01:34:00,820
versus the of the Yin and the Yang,
now you have someone who is exploiting

2011
01:34:00,821 --> 01:34:05,170
that and you see it with women too and
they see it with like aggressive women

2012
01:34:05,171 --> 01:34:07,240
and weak men.
That is,

2013
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:10,090
to me,
one of the saddest things I ever see is

2014
01:34:10,091 --> 01:34:14,540
when you find the aggressive women and
the weak man cut.

2015
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,510
Probably because I'm terrified of it
ever been me.

2016
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,390
You know,
I don't think it will be,

2017
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,700
but I mean if it was,
you know,

2018
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:24,670
nobody wants that.
Nobody wants a woman who's yelling at

2019
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:26,730
you and andy goes,
woohoo.

2020
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,690
That happens a lot,
a lot,

2021
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,850
a lot.
It's kind of crazy to me because,

2022
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,860
you know,
I see women emasculate men quite often,

2023
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:42,340
you know,
not maybe on like a huge scale to the

2024
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:44,860
degree you're talking about,
but just like the little comments,

2025
01:34:44,861 --> 01:34:48,400
like I'll be out with a couple and the
woman will say something and it's,

2026
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:53,510
it's kind of emasculating.
If the roles were reversed and the guy

2027
01:34:53,591 --> 01:34:56,080
said something like that to the woman,
I don't know if it would go over,

2028
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:58,040
you know,
guys just kinda take it

2029
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,040
on sometimes and then when I see that
I'm like,

2030
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:05,720
a lot of men feel emasculated by society
in general,

2031
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:09,160
just by the roles that they play in the
office and the,

2032
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,033
just the,
the,

2033
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:15,060
the physical act of going through life,
this civilized world and also constantly

2034
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:21,401
needing people's affirmation,
needing people's acceptance and,

2035
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:25,430
and you,
you sort of become what people want you

2036
01:35:25,431 --> 01:35:27,560
to be,
even if that's not what you want.

2037
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:32,570
You get in these relationships and you
see it all the time where a guy sort of

2038
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:35,960
accept a little bit and then they accept
more and then they don't want to mess

2039
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:38,420
up.
And then I have a bunch of friends that

2040
01:35:38,421 --> 01:35:42,440
have like really domineering,
overbearing wives or girlfriends.

2041
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,990
And it's weird.
It's weird to be around them.

2042
01:35:44,991 --> 01:35:45,351
Like,
dude,

2043
01:35:45,351 --> 01:35:46,190
you know,
you can leave.

2044
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:47,640
Like,
he just like,

2045
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:48,650
this is just a person.

2046
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,870
Why do you think they don't?
Because they're scared.

2047
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,960
They're scared and it becomes the thing.
You know,

2048
01:35:53,961 --> 01:35:55,010
that's,
that's the thing,

2049
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,810
this is the thing,
or go out of the fucking wife,

2050
01:35:56,811 --> 01:35:58,400
we're going to go home to the wife,
you know,

2051
01:35:58,401 --> 01:35:59,520
and it's,
it's,

2052
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:02,240
it's very strange.
It's very strange when you have someone

2053
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:05,150
in your life that's essentially like a
parole officer,

2054
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:08,630
so many life that gets to tell you what
to do and you're not allowed to do

2055
01:36:08,631 --> 01:36:10,940
certain things.
You're not allowed to watch certain

2056
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:14,360
things or certain things and they
control you and they own.

2057
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:16,130
You mean this,
this,

2058
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:18,800
and I think a lot of these people that
are doing that,

2059
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,980
much like the girl who bullied you or
any,

2060
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,560
anybody who does that to someone,
they,

2061
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:27,230
they do it out of,
out of fear.

2062
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:30,830
They do that to insecurity and they also
do it out of this bizarre instinct

2063
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:31,730
because they can.

2064
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:35,690
I state this girl,
she wasn't a bad person but she used to

2065
01:36:35,691 --> 01:36:37,730
like to fight and I don't.
I do not.

2066
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:40,520
I do not like to.
I don't like that kind of conflict.

2067
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:42,500
I don't like,
like interrelationship conflict.

2068
01:36:42,501 --> 01:36:43,670
I don't do.
I don't like it.

2069
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:45,620
I won't fight and argue.
I just rather leave.

2070
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,200
I'm like all into I'm into discussing
things,

2071
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:49,940
but when people start yelling and get
crazy,

2072
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,230
I'm like,
fuck this.

2073
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:54,910
I grew up.
I grew up around domestic violence too.

2074
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:58,400
I grew up with a,
so I saw it when I was a kid.

2075
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:03,290
I just,
I'm not interested and so we broke up,

2076
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:07,820
but we stayed friends and then years
later we went out to coffee and like,

2077
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:09,380
how's everything?
What's going on?

2078
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:11,420
I'm living with this guy.
It's not going good.

2079
01:37:11,421 --> 01:37:11,931
I'm like,
why?

2080
01:37:11,931 --> 01:37:14,780
She's like,
she's telling me how she yells at this

2081
01:37:14,781 --> 01:37:16,490
guy and she can't help it.

2082
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:18,290
She's like,
I can't help it.

2083
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,650
I just fucking yell at him and he
doesn't do anything.

2084
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,230
He just takes it and she's like,
he takes it.

2085
01:37:24,231 --> 01:37:26,840
I just want to fucking smash him.
She's like,

2086
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:27,740
I just can't.
She goes,

2087
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:29,840
I don't want to yell at them,
but I can't help doing it.

2088
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:31,130
And then when he's gone,
I'm like,

2089
01:37:31,131 --> 01:37:35,870
why the fuck did I do that?
And she had this weird,

2090
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:40,160
almost like a natural impulse to
dominate this guy.

2091
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:44,210
Like if you ever seen two dogs,
one dog has the upper hand on the on the

2092
01:37:44,211 --> 01:37:48,370
dog and he'll go near the dog and the
other dog and that's just,

2093
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,870
that's just their world.
That's just their world.

2094
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:54,830
The other dog never gets a chance and
sometimes it's not even a size based

2095
01:37:54,831 --> 01:37:57,060
thing or they might be the exact same
size dog,

2096
01:37:57,061 --> 01:38:01,080
just one dog just decides the bitch and
the other one's the dominator and that's

2097
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:03,810
just how it goes.
While she was in this position with this

2098
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:08,811
guy where she just had this compelling
desire to fucking yell at them.

2099
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,451
And I go,
well,

2100
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:10,940
what are you yelling at him for?
She's like,

2101
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,660
anything,
everything.

2102
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,551
She goes,
I just,

2103
01:38:13,551 --> 01:38:16,320
I just fucking.
I want him to tell me to shut the fuck

2104
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:16,540
up.

2105
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,760
Yeah.
She wanted him to out manner.

2106
01:38:19,410 --> 01:38:20,790
Yeah.
But isn't that crazy?

2107
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:24,960
Like what a bizarre instinct to like to,
to push.

2108
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:29,610
Like she was frustrated at herself.
She was frustrated at him,

2109
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:33,330
but it's almost like she was compelled,
like she's being drawn to the great

2110
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:34,690
magnet,
you know?

2111
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:35,663
It's like,
oh,

2112
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,310
I'm going to scream at them.
Right.

2113
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:41,290
Well it's interesting like how we
project onto other people,

2114
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,550
you know,
like whatever.

2115
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:46,390
Some of that was going on inside of her
that was like creating that dynamic in

2116
01:38:46,391 --> 01:38:48,010
him and then she could have left at any
time.

2117
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:53,040
It was like she was so trying to get a
reaction out of him honestly to probably

2118
01:38:53,111 --> 01:38:55,460
see if he cared.
Like she probably equated.

2119
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,820
Alright well him taking it means he
doesn't care.

2120
01:38:57,850 --> 01:39:00,310
So how much can I push?
How much can I push,

2121
01:39:00,311 --> 01:39:02,510
how can I match,
can I push so that I can see that he,

2122
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,150
he'll react enough because that means.

2123
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,800
Do you think that's what it is that she
didn't think he cares or do you think

2124
01:39:06,801 --> 01:39:09,590
she just thinks he's weak and it's just
frustrating to her that he's weak?

2125
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:11,380
Well,
if it was just that,

2126
01:39:11,381 --> 01:39:12,880
I think she would have left a lot
earlier.

2127
01:39:12,881 --> 01:39:16,540
There was something she wanted,
like we don't keep doing it over and

2128
01:39:16,541 --> 01:39:19,720
over and over again unless there's
something more attached to getting.

2129
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:20,801
Like,
you know,

2130
01:39:20,801 --> 01:39:22,480
when we're just went and we're like,
Oh man,

2131
01:39:22,481 --> 01:39:23,190
this is stupid.
We,

2132
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:26,350
we get out of there.
But when we find ourselves in situations

2133
01:39:26,351 --> 01:39:29,770
where it's like it's happening over and
over and over again and tend to get

2134
01:39:29,771 --> 01:39:33,100
frustrated but we're not leaving.
There's something we're attached to

2135
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:37,300
trying to get from our behavior.
So there was something she wanted in

2136
01:39:37,301 --> 01:39:38,810
that,
there was something in it for her,

2137
01:39:38,811 --> 01:39:40,210
although I should have been out there a
lot sooner.

2138
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,860
I wonder.
It was also she was trying to do the

2139
01:39:42,861 --> 01:39:45,860
acting thing and she was constantly
frustrated.

2140
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,820
She was constantly just taking it out
and everything.

2141
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,820
Well that it was,
it would be really interesting.

2142
01:39:52,821 --> 01:39:55,640
Like I'd watch these like almost sort of
manic things.

2143
01:39:55,790 --> 01:40:00,790
Like there would be these moments where
she would be preparing for an audition

2144
01:40:00,891 --> 01:40:04,280
and she'd be hopeful yet nervous.
There was a lot of anxiety and there was

2145
01:40:04,281 --> 01:40:06,950
all this,
here's the thing and it's going to go

2146
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:09,980
and hopefully if this happens,
this guy's connected to this and that's

2147
01:40:09,981 --> 01:40:12,230
going to happen with that.
And then boom,

2148
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,880
it didn't happen.
And so there's this massive let down,

2149
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:18,350
there's a cigarette smoking and
depression and you know,

2150
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:23,420
all this angst and I got the fuck out of
there.

2151
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:28,050
But this dude got in there like,
and he caught me,

2152
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:28,940
he caught,
you know,

2153
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:31,880
the second wave of angst when I met her.

2154
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,020
She was just moving here and so she
wasn't completely bewildered by the

2155
01:40:36,021 --> 01:40:37,960
experience in the machine yet.
Yeah.

2156
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:43,570
And it's also,
I think for some people choosing things

2157
01:40:43,791 --> 01:40:47,240
that you do for a living that are
healthy for you,

2158
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:52,040
I think there's a lot of people that get
involved in careers that require too

2159
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:54,580
much of their time.
You don't really want to do it,

2160
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:57,050
but you get caught up in it.
Whether it's being a lawyer,

2161
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,930
being a doctor,
or being something that has a

2162
01:40:58,931 --> 01:41:02,220
prestigious title when you feel like
there's something great tech,

2163
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:06,180
but really in the back of your mind,
there's something else that you probably

2164
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,590
be way happier doing.
I mean,

2165
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,060
that was me.
I was going after it for the wrong

2166
01:41:10,061 --> 01:41:11,800
reasons.
What do you want to do though?

2167
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:14,380
If you weren't doing a life coach,
I know you enjoy doing what you're

2168
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:17,110
doing,
but you have like if somehow or another

2169
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:20,440
you were independently wealthy and you
didn't have to coach all these crazy

2170
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:21,274
people.

2171
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:25,040
Not that they're crazy,
but some of them will probably do it.

2172
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:26,870
I mean like I,
you know,

2173
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:28,991
this,
I,

2174
01:41:28,991 --> 01:41:31,670
I love people and I love personal
development.

2175
01:41:31,671 --> 01:41:33,440
Even if I had all the money in the
world,

2176
01:41:33,441 --> 01:41:35,810
I still speak.
I'd still do my podcasts.

2177
01:41:35,811 --> 01:41:38,060
I'd still do retreats.
I,

2178
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:41,600
I love it.
Like I love the human experience.

2179
01:41:41,601 --> 01:41:45,860
I love being there for that moment where
someone has a major insight where they

2180
01:41:45,861 --> 01:41:50,090
connect dots and it's like Whoa,
a massive perspective shift and like all

2181
01:41:50,091 --> 01:41:53,030
of a sudden they start to kind of move a
different direction.

2182
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:56,000
It's,
I can't imagine doing anything else.

2183
01:41:56,001 --> 01:41:58,910
I mean if I could sing,
if I had any kind of music ability,

2184
01:41:58,911 --> 01:42:00,950
I think it'd be awesome to be a rock
star.

2185
01:42:00,951 --> 01:42:05,951
Like just to have that rush,
but literally I have no musical ability

2186
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:09,410
whatsoever other than listening to it.
I'm just do not have it.

2187
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:12,280
Well that's great.
So you found your thing now how often is

2188
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:14,350
it when you talk to be,
but when you're trying to coach them and

2189
01:42:14,351 --> 01:42:16,360
help them and you realize like,
man,

2190
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:19,180
you got to do something else.
Like is that A.

2191
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:22,180
is that a factor?
Because I would think that see the thing

2192
01:42:22,181 --> 01:42:25,030
about careers is not only is it eight
hours of your time,

2193
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:28,900
but it also kind of defines you,
so every day you're defined by whatever

2194
01:42:28,901 --> 01:42:32,500
you do and oftentimes,
like we were talking about like men in

2195
01:42:32,501 --> 01:42:35,140
these workplace environments,
there's sort of like,

2196
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:39,310
they're boxed into this predetermined
pattern or behavior that's expected from

2197
01:42:39,311 --> 01:42:39,731
them.
You know,

2198
01:42:39,731 --> 01:42:44,731
they have shoes with tassels on them and
ties and they have to talk business talk

2199
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:49,810
and it's like you fall into these weird
patterns and you lose a lot of your

2200
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:54,790
individuality inside those patterns
because office life and you know,

2201
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,400
human resources demand certain things of
you.

2202
01:42:57,401 --> 01:43:02,401
Like there's a certain your personality,
like when you're in an office

2203
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:05,800
environment,
anytime you're in the corporate world,

2204
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:10,990
your personality is stuffed into this
form.

2205
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:13,750
Whatever that form is,
whatever that mold is,

2206
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:16,270
the mold of being a business person.
You know,

2207
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:18,520
you know you're a woman.
You're a businesswoman.

2208
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:22,120
You want to be respected and want to use
the right word to say the right things

2209
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:23,180
and you know,
and,

2210
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:28,190
and talk the right lingo.
But the like a lot of times people are

2211
01:43:28,571 --> 01:43:30,970
left wondering who the fuck am I?
Right,

2212
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:31,580
right,

2213
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:33,590
right.
They just get totally lost in a role.

2214
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:35,331
Yeah.
And I do like,

2215
01:43:35,331 --> 01:43:39,050
I go do a lot of corporate speaking and
I have a lot of people come up to me

2216
01:43:39,051 --> 01:43:41,510
afterwards and they're just like,
oh my gosh,

2217
01:43:41,511 --> 01:43:43,310
like I'm.
Because I talk about,

2218
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,340
you know,
how we lose ourselves in these roles and

2219
01:43:46,341 --> 01:43:51,341
how like a lot of times our adult life
becomes sort of just this like checklist

2220
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:52,340
follow

2221
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,770
Truman show.
Like one thing after the other just like

2222
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:57,200
follow this structure that was set out
for us.

2223
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,690
We never checked in and said,
do I want this?

2224
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:01,130
Like,
do I even want this?

2225
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:03,560
You know.
And so to answer your question,

2226
01:44:03,561 --> 01:44:06,110
yes,
a lot of times when people come or I'm

2227
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:08,750
working with people,
it is like looking at like,

2228
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:10,580
is this,
is this career right for you?

2229
01:44:10,581 --> 01:44:13,640
Is this relationship right for you?
Like what have you created in your life

2230
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:16,670
that just doesn't fit where you are,
but you're in it because you're scared

2231
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:18,270
to make the change.
And,

2232
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,220
and also,
you know,

2233
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,030
some people really can be happy in
corporate America,

2234
01:44:23,031 --> 01:44:23,900
like some people

2235
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,390
she works for them.
I,

2236
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:30,350
um,
I really believe that the vast majority

2237
01:44:30,351 --> 01:44:32,660
of people that are living the American
dream,

2238
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:34,670
living that life during that nine to
five,

2239
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:38,710
the vast majority of them are fucking
horrific.

2240
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:40,970
Horrifically miserable.
Yeah.

2241
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:42,800
I really do believe that.
I think it's,

2242
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:47,570
it's so defining and it's so.
It's so contrary to the human spirit.

2243
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:48,870
Right?
Right.

2244
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,410
But I think most people don't want to
believe that.

2245
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,750
They don't want to believe that it's
possible that everybody's doing

2246
01:44:53,751 --> 01:44:54,590
something wrong.
Right.

2247
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,600
And they don't believe they can change
it then.

2248
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,310
Yeah.
There's no other option.

2249
01:44:58,311 --> 01:45:01,370
I don't know what else to do,
especially if they have a mortgage and a

2250
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:03,260
spouse and kids,
student loans,

2251
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:04,550
all that stuff.
Yeah.

2252
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,920
It's really intimidating to go,
oh gosh,

2253
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:08,810
how do I,
how do I change this?

2254
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:12,020
I think you have to start small.
I think you have to start with,

2255
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,300
okay,
I don't have to quit my job tomorrow,

2256
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:18,260
but what are some things in my life I
can start doing that made me feel alive

2257
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:19,100
again?
Like,

2258
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:21,800
is it a hobby,
is it like training for a marathon?

2259
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:24,950
Is it what is going to start making me
feel like,

2260
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,620
you know,
I'm creative and I matter and I'm more

2261
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:29,870
than just this role as husband,
wife,

2262
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:30,680
mother,
father,

2263
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:33,020
corporate executive,
whatever it is.

2264
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:37,610
So I think that's a good place to start
is something small you can do to make

2265
01:45:37,611 --> 01:45:39,860
you feel alive again because anybody has
access to that,

2266
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:40,300
right?

2267
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,670
You don't have to leave your job to
start creating some things in your life

2268
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:47,060
that can start to shift things and then
like we were talking about then it's

2269
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:48,770
like the gradual change,
you know,

2270
01:45:48,771 --> 01:45:51,530
because I don't think it's possible for
most people just to quit their job

2271
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:53,450
tomorrow.
They don't think it's possible.

2272
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:56,020
Right.
Almost knowing exactly what and,

2273
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:58,790
and not everybody's meant to be an
entrepreneur either and do their own

2274
01:45:58,791 --> 01:46:02,030
thing,
but there are always things we can do in

2275
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:06,290
our life to mix it up a little bit and
even just show up differently in our

2276
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:07,124
job.

2277
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:10,980
Yeah.
I just think that for a huge amount of

2278
01:46:10,981 --> 01:46:13,980
people,
the amount of time that's required of

2279
01:46:13,981 --> 01:46:14,700
them.
Yeah.

2280
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:19,410
Because of their job is so overwhelming
because most people,

2281
01:46:19,411 --> 01:46:22,080
let's be honest or not really just
working nine to five,

2282
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:25,110
particularly most men,
there's a tremendous amount of overtime

2283
01:46:25,111 --> 01:46:25,944
involvement.
Yes.

2284
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:28,260
I was looking at some thing that was
talking about.

2285
01:46:28,261 --> 01:46:31,500
It was an article on the wage gap
difference in what would it really is

2286
01:46:31,501 --> 01:46:33,720
about.
And one of the things that was about was

2287
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:37,360
the amount of the difference in the
amount of hours that men work and in

2288
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:40,140
their ambition to try to climb up the
corporate ladder.

2289
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:44,790
And you look at the numbers that people
work and it's terrifying.

2290
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,760
There's no lie.
If you're working 60 hours a week,

2291
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,430
you don't have a life.
There's nothing left.

2292
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:51,870
If I worked here,
um,

2293
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:55,890
I'll do a podcast or three hours and
I'll do a bunch of other stuff and you

2294
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,900
know,
I'm trying to fit in things in my day

2295
01:46:57,901 --> 01:46:59,520
and I have a pretty loose schedule.

2296
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:00,900
I mean,
I do a lot of things,

2297
01:47:00,901 --> 01:47:02,670
but it's pretty loose.
You know,

2298
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:07,410
like today I did UFC stuff for a couple
hours this morning and then I come here

2299
01:47:07,411 --> 01:47:09,350
for a few hours.
Then I got to work out.

2300
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:13,110
Then it will tell some jokes,
but there's a lot of movement in there.

2301
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:14,880
There's a lot of times where I can get
shit done.

2302
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,650
Yeah.
Some people don't have any of that.

2303
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:21,180
It have nothing.
So what do you think was like that made

2304
01:47:21,181 --> 01:47:22,970
you different,
like back in the day where you could

2305
01:47:22,971 --> 01:47:26,370
have done that path of the corporate
route?

2306
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:29,610
Why did you make different choices?
It's a good question.

2307
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:30,510
I don't know.
Probably.

2308
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:32,190
I don't know.
I don't know.

2309
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:37,220
I mean I never felt like I could.
I never felt like I could have a regular

2310
01:47:37,261 --> 01:47:39,900
job like I.
from the time I got out of high school,

2311
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,660
I never had a full time job.

2312
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:45,570
I had a bunch of part time jobs.
I did some full time jobs,

2313
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:48,540
were construction companies and stuff,
but it didn't last.

2314
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:51,360
I would do them for like a month or a
couple of weeks and I was like,

2315
01:47:51,361 --> 01:47:54,510
fuck this,
like whatever it is about.

2316
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:58,500
And it was all.
It was the main source

2317
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:04,980
of all my problems in high school.
All my problems in high school is I was

2318
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:07,050
not willing to do things I didn't want
to do,

2319
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,840
so I would barely get by through high
school.

2320
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:14,280
I go take tests.
They would register intelligence or

2321
01:48:14,281 --> 01:48:15,510
measure intelligence.
That'd be great.

2322
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:19,410
Everything's fine,
but I would take actual test based on

2323
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:22,440
what I was supposed to be studying and I
fucking barely paid attention.

2324
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:27,650
I mean I squoze through high school with
like a c average in most things.

2325
01:48:28,081 --> 01:48:32,160
I barely got by and even when I was
going to college I was only going to

2326
01:48:32,161 --> 01:48:32,580
college.

2327
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:36,540
I went to Boston University and our
umass rather in Boston and the only

2328
01:48:36,541 --> 01:48:40,350
reason why I went is because I didn't
want anybody to think I was a loser.

2329
01:48:40,650 --> 01:48:42,730
So I was taking classes at Umass and
was.

2330
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:46,290
It was and I was teaching taekwondo at
Boston University,

2331
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:51,291
which is a really good school and I was
looking at all these people that were

2332
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,870
preparing for life and to me it was
like,

2333
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:57,020
you're going to go get eaten by
alligators or something.

2334
01:48:57,021 --> 01:48:58,050
And I was like,
what are you going to do?

2335
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:01,110
You're going to go get a job.
You're going to be working nine to five

2336
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:03,570
for whatever,
whatever fucked up thing that was wrong

2337
01:49:03,571 --> 01:49:06,150
in my head.
I would way rather get up in the morning

2338
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:09,840
and deliver newspapers for three hours a
day or drive limos at night.

2339
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:12,990
I.
I had a really unstable childhood,

2340
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:16,500
so in my mind,
anything that you were locked down to

2341
01:49:16,501 --> 01:49:17,430
was death.

2342
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:22,200
It was prison and I,
whatever malfunction of my brain,

2343
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,430
I figured out a way to make it work for
me.

2344
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:27,270
Survival skill.
Yeah,

2345
01:49:27,830 --> 01:49:31,440
in some way,
but also a lack of like I'm not very

2346
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:33,720
disciplined.
It looks like I'm disciplined on the

2347
01:49:33,721 --> 01:49:35,370
outside.
I'm not disciplined at all.

2348
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:38,490
I'm obsessed.
I get obsessed with things whether I'm

2349
01:49:38,491 --> 01:49:41,940
disciplined with in certain aspects like
with exercise and I do it when I don't

2350
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:44,280
want to do it.
I forced myself to practice and I forced

2351
01:49:44,281 --> 01:49:46,770
myself to write.
I forced myself to do things,

2352
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:49,690
but more of it's more of an obsession
thing.

2353
01:49:49,691 --> 01:49:54,691
Like I get obsessed with either goals or
tasks or things or puzzles or games.

2354
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:01,300
I got a real problem,
like there's something wrong with me.

2355
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:03,830
Well why do you say that?
As a field draining

2356
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:06,610
no,
because like I'll play pool for 12 hours

2357
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:07,900
in a row,
like I'll,

2358
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,510
I'll get obsessed with playing pool and
then I think I'm going to be the world

2359
01:50:10,511 --> 01:50:12,790
champion.
I'm going to practice 12 hours a day for

2360
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:14,110
the rest of my life.
I mean I,

2361
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:16,030
I,
I'm a sick person.

2362
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:18,460
Like whatever happened to me when I was
young,

2363
01:50:18,461 --> 01:50:21,650
like whatever weirdness in involved in
it.

2364
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,910
I figured out a way to manage it,
but it can get away from me.

2365
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:27,160
It's gotten away from me before I played
video games,

2366
01:50:27,161 --> 01:50:28,450
like eight,
10 hours a day.

2367
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:32,860
It can get away.
I got have to manage whatever craziness

2368
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,730
that makes me like focus on things.
Yeah.

2369
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:39,010
I see it in my kids.
Especially my middle daughter,

2370
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:41,500
she's,
she gets obsessed with things and I'm

2371
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:41,951
like,
wow,

2372
01:50:41,951 --> 01:50:43,870
this is crazy.
It's like a genetic thing.

2373
01:50:43,871 --> 01:50:46,540
It's like watching a little female,
me and a lot of ways,

2374
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:49,840
you know,
like she read all eight Harry Potter

2375
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:51,700
books in a matter of a couple of months.

2376
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:55,370
She just,
she just gets into stuff and then you've

2377
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:55,871
got to go,
Hey,

2378
01:50:55,871 --> 01:50:57,910
shut the light out.
You got to go to bed one more chapter

2379
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,451
like,
come on,

2380
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:00,610
you got to stop.
It's been um,

2381
01:51:00,670 --> 01:51:05,530
it's not like she's seen it in me and
she's mirroring it because it's her own

2382
01:51:05,531 --> 01:51:06,880
little weirdness,
you know,

2383
01:51:06,881 --> 01:51:11,620
but I think it's obviously she's got a
healthier environment than I grew up in,

2384
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:16,540
so it's not like a,
a matter of plug not ever not ever

2385
01:51:16,541 --> 01:51:19,090
wanting to be connected to anything
permanent because nothing is permanent.

2386
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:22,150
I mean that was part of,
I think with the lessons from my

2387
01:51:22,151 --> 01:51:24,130
childhood.
Like no one's here to help you.

2388
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:26,470
Not As,
don't get locked in any fucking job,

2389
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:29,010
don't get locked in and you get ready to
move in anytime,

2390
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:31,150
you know.
And embracing moving.

2391
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:33,020
Like to this day I'll be,
I'll be like,

2392
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,330
I gotta get the fuck out of La.

2393
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,310
Like everything's here.
I have to do everything here.

2394
01:51:36,311 --> 01:51:38,410
The comedy is here,
my family's here.

2395
01:51:38,411 --> 01:51:40,420
My kids go to school here.
All my friends live here,

2396
01:51:40,421 --> 01:51:41,201
but I'm like,
fuck this.

2397
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:42,640
I'm going to the mountains.
I gotta get Outta here.

2398
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:47,650
Like I have this like no mad shit in me
that I'm like constantly trying to,

2399
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:50,500
um,
to manage.

2400
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:54,370
So
as much as people like to take credit

2401
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,880
for a certain amount of success,
like I can tell you all the different

2402
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:00,790
things that I did that led to me being
successful at things.

2403
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:05,080
But almost it's like the function of a
mental issue,

2404
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:09,700
like a big,
a lot of it is a function of learning

2405
01:52:09,701 --> 01:52:14,080
how to manage a brain that doesn't work
like everybody else's brain.

2406
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,890
That's so I think common for a lot of
successful people especially.

2407
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,940
And the differences.
You're aware of how it works and you've

2408
01:52:24,941 --> 01:52:27,940
learned how to manage it,
but that you know,

2409
01:52:27,941 --> 01:52:31,780
that obsessive thing in so many ways it
has made you,

2410
01:52:31,781 --> 01:52:34,900
it has gotten you a certain degree of
success and all of those things,

2411
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:37,510
survival skills,
compensatory strategies,

2412
01:52:37,511 --> 01:52:39,910
whatever they are,
they have their positives,

2413
01:52:39,911 --> 01:52:43,270
they have ways that they really help us.
But then they have the ways that kind of

2414
01:52:43,271 --> 01:52:46,010
torture us and a lot of ways.
And I think

2415
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:50,000
growth is really about understanding
what are the ways that this isn't doing

2416
01:52:50,001 --> 01:52:52,610
me any good and how can I be mindful of
it.

2417
01:52:52,611 --> 01:52:55,130
And also like,
you know,

2418
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:59,060
how,
how do I know now that like that now is

2419
01:52:59,061 --> 01:53:04,061
not then like how do I stop being
activated by old experiences in my past

2420
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:10,150
and just have peace for where I am now
and take those gifts from the obsession

2421
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:13,750
that's made you successful but not have
the parts that kind of torture you at

2422
01:53:13,751 --> 01:53:14,500
the same.

2423
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,060
Well,
I don't feel tortured.

2424
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:18,760
Um,
so I think in some ways have achieved

2425
01:53:18,761 --> 01:53:22,030
some sort of a victory over my whatever
mental issues that I have.

2426
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:24,670
But I can't do nothing.
Right.

2427
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:30,810
That's the reason why I have three jobs.
I can't do that if I do.

2428
01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:35,680
And I have three jobs and a fucking ton
of obsessions outside of those jobs.

2429
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:40,320
Martial arts,
archery or reading and writing and all

2430
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:43,450
sorts of other stuff on top of
podcasting,

2431
01:53:43,451 --> 01:53:46,030
doing the commentary for the UFC,
doing standup comedy.

2432
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:49,530
Like that's the only way I'm,
I feel even.

2433
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,970
Yeah.
And I can't have one thing that I count

2434
01:53:51,971 --> 01:53:53,770
on either.
If I had,

2435
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:57,160
if I only had standup comedy or only had
the UFC.

2436
01:53:57,161 --> 01:53:59,650
If there's only one thing or only had
podcasting,

2437
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,360
I'd be like,
this is my.

2438
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:03,250
I got it.
I would want to quit.

2439
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,630
I was like,
I don't want to do this anymore.

2440
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:06,790
This is my fucking thing.
I'm just going to be trapped doing this

2441
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:09,130
thing.
Talking into a fucking microphone out

2442
01:54:09,131 --> 01:54:11,920
into space for the rest of my life.
I got to go to fucking.

2443
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,420
I don't even want to hear myself
anymore.

2444
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:14,690
I've got to quit.
No.

2445
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:18,340
So whatever weird malfunction my brains
had.

2446
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:22,300
I've figured out a way over all the
years of my life to,

2447
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:26,950
to manage it,
but a lot of his physical to managing my

2448
01:54:26,951 --> 01:54:30,640
brain,
a lot of it requires intense exercise.

2449
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:33,280
Like when I,
when I intensely exercise,

2450
01:54:33,281 --> 01:54:35,190
then I can like,
oh alright,

2451
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:37,570
it's gonna be all right,
it's going to be cool.

2452
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:41,440
But if I don't,
it's like it's all built up.

2453
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:43,570
And then there's,
it's hard to enjoy things.

2454
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:47,950
It's hard to just chill.
Like I can't chill unless I earn it.

2455
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,730
It gets a,
it's probably a malfunction,

2456
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:56,470
but it's the illusion is that it's not
the illusion is that it's a discipline

2457
01:54:56,471 --> 01:54:58,210
and then it's all,
it's all choices,

2458
01:54:58,211 --> 01:55:00,100
but that's really not the case.

2459
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:04,400
Maybe it's just you and how you operate
your operating system.

2460
01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:06,410
Are You coaching me now?
So what's going on here?

2461
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:09,560
Does that feel like I am?

2462
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:13,550
Yeah,
maybe it is me.

2463
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:15,030
I mean,
I think people,

2464
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:18,750
and that's not a bad thing.
I think that they're back to the

2465
01:55:18,751 --> 01:55:22,440
acceptance thing.
There's a lot of ways I think we're

2466
01:55:22,441 --> 01:55:26,130
supposed to be and we look at other
people and how they do their life or

2467
01:55:26,131 --> 01:55:28,470
whatever and we think that because we're
acting this way,

2468
01:55:28,471 --> 01:55:30,930
something must be wrong with us,
but a lot of times there is not.

2469
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:33,600
This is just the way you operate.

2470
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:36,900
You don't want to.
And that's the thing is interesting is

2471
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:40,770
um,
when I was a kid I was a not very

2472
01:55:40,771 --> 01:55:45,390
confident and also didn't like to,
to people get anxiety again,

2473
01:55:45,391 --> 01:55:48,090
anxiety.
If I had a talk and I get anxiety,

2474
01:55:48,091 --> 01:55:51,330
if I had to like talk to a bank teller,
like if I had to wait in line to go to

2475
01:55:51,331 --> 01:55:54,090
the bank teller,
I'd start freaking out like on my way to

2476
01:55:54,091 --> 01:55:57,990
the bank teller and like if you talked
to like people who knew me from high

2477
01:55:57,991 --> 01:56:00,000
school and they'll go,
uh,

2478
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:02,310
did you ever think that Joe is going to
be a comedian?

2479
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:04,010
They be like,
no,

2480
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:06,240
like no fucking way.
That guy was at funny,

2481
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:11,040
like they didn't.
I figured out a way to be more relaxed

2482
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:14,100
socially and it wasn't an easy process
at all.

2483
01:56:14,101 --> 01:56:18,600
It took forever to the point where now
I'm extremely relaxed socially.

2484
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,770
Like now I can talk to anybody.
Like I don't.

2485
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:23,190
I love one of the things I love about
doing podcasts.

2486
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:25,350
I like just having conversations with
people.

2487
01:56:25,351 --> 01:56:26,070
Yeah,
I will.

2488
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:27,180
I will.
I want to know,

2489
01:56:27,181 --> 01:56:29,670
like you're another organism.
You're another person.

2490
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:30,990
I want to know what's going on in your
head.

2491
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:34,270
I don't understand your life.
I wanna I wanna own a.

2492
01:56:34,271 --> 01:56:37,280
try to see what connections you've made,
what,

2493
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:40,410
what definitions you've fallen on,
you know,

2494
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,080
what you know,
how you've defined this world,

2495
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:46,050
how you've,
how you've categorized things and how

2496
01:56:46,051 --> 01:56:47,120
you're managing it.
How are you,

2497
01:56:47,150 --> 01:56:50,250
how are you maneuvering through it?
I'm fascinated by that.

2498
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:55,640
I'm fascinated by the thoughts that
people carry around inside their heads.

2499
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,150
Yeah,
me too.

2500
01:56:57,710 --> 01:56:58,543
Yeah,
I love it.

2501
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:02,640
And whether or not they're empowering or
whether or not you're a woe is me type

2502
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:04,290
person,
you know,

2503
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:08,600
and one of the puzzle pieces that have
led to where you are and I love that

2504
01:57:08,601 --> 01:57:11,270
you're sharing this because I think a
lot of people can see you and see your

2505
01:57:11,271 --> 01:57:16,220
success in everything that you have and
thank you were always like this and then

2506
01:57:16,221 --> 01:57:17,680
it's just been easy because it's this,
you know,

2507
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:20,570
you're always like this,
but to know you had that background and

2508
01:57:20,571 --> 01:57:23,750
you had the social anxiety and this is
like such a stretch.

2509
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:27,650
I think it's really inspiring because it
gives people.

2510
01:57:27,651 --> 01:57:28,471
It's like,
oh you,

2511
01:57:28,471 --> 01:57:31,190
you can't.
You can no longer argue that,

2512
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:32,720
you know,
you're just born a certain way.

2513
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:35,120
And like,
that's just the way you are,

2514
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:39,440
like your proof that you actually can
change and you can't get over things and

2515
01:57:39,441 --> 01:57:42,950
you can create things that you know,
you probably didn't think were possible

2516
01:57:42,951 --> 01:57:45,560
when you were 10 or however old you were
when you were going through all that

2517
01:57:45,561 --> 01:57:46,394
stuff.

2518
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:47,460
Yeah,
I think

2519
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:52,770
people have different starting points
and now it's like I was saying that if

2520
01:57:52,771 --> 01:57:54,690
you want to climb Mount Everest,
good luck.

2521
01:57:54,691 --> 01:57:57,390
If you're starting from Santa Monica,
you got to fucking walk all the way to

2522
01:57:57,391 --> 01:57:59,850
Tibet.
It's going to take a long ass time.

2523
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:03,420
Ocean is going to be hard to get across.
But if you're at the base of Tibet,

2524
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:06,540
if that's what you live,
it's or the base of the Himalayas,

2525
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,050
it's way easier to climb that thing.
You know,

2526
01:58:10,051 --> 01:58:12,270
it's still not easy,
but it's easier.

2527
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,820
And I think there's a lot of people that
start,

2528
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:18,780
you know,
in the a metaphoric Santa Monica would

2529
01:58:18,781 --> 01:58:21,480
their life,
they're really far away from their goal.

2530
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:25,050
It doesn't mean it's not possible,
but it means there's a bunch of steps,

2531
01:58:25,051 --> 01:58:28,590
whether they're conscious or unconscious
that you're going to have to make in

2532
01:58:28,591 --> 01:58:29,940
order to get to a position.

2533
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:34,410
And I still remember fucking freaking
out going to a bank teller or used to

2534
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:37,170
having all the time.
I just didn't want to talk to people.

2535
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:42,410
I was just in my own head and I was
super insecure and I just could barely

2536
01:58:42,671 --> 01:58:44,230
get through shit,
you know,

2537
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:46,840
what changed it,
just doing it over and over again.

2538
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:50,680
Martial arts was a big thing.
The martial arts is the first thing that

2539
01:58:50,681 --> 01:58:54,640
I ever did where I was good at it or I
didn't feel like a loser.

2540
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:58,130
It was like I'd done.
I was pretty good at art and uh,

2541
01:58:58,910 --> 01:59:00,120
yes.
Yeah.

2542
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:04,540
And I wanted to be a comic book
illustrator and that was like a big

2543
01:59:04,541 --> 01:59:07,450
focus in my life when I was younger.
But um,

2544
01:59:07,451 --> 01:59:09,850
I mean,
and I and I definitely took some sort of

2545
01:59:09,851 --> 01:59:12,040
identity in the fact that I was good at
that.

2546
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:15,220
I liked the fact that people would say I
was good at it and made me feel good,

2547
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,080
but it was different than martial arts
because with martial arts,

2548
01:59:20,150 --> 01:59:23,050
um,
it was the first thing that I did where

2549
01:59:23,051 --> 01:59:25,870
I felt like I could really be
exceptional.

2550
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:29,080
Like it could be really good,
like in an hour,

2551
01:59:29,081 --> 01:59:34,081
realized that
first of all I was gifted physically and

2552
01:59:34,721 --> 01:59:39,670
then also this crazy brain of mine,
if I could point it to something,

2553
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:42,700
like I would work out at 3:00 in the
morning because I knew nobody else

2554
01:59:42,701 --> 01:59:44,410
would.
I knew they weren't there,

2555
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:47,230
so I had keys to the gym.
So,

2556
01:59:47,231 --> 01:59:48,310
uh,
because I was teaching,

2557
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:52,390
so I would go there,
I'd wake up and I would drive down to

2558
01:59:52,391 --> 01:59:56,200
the gym and I opened it up in the middle
of the night and put in a workout

2559
01:59:56,530 --> 01:59:59,080
because I knew that no one else was
doing that.

2560
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:02,930
I knew they weren't there and I knew,
I felt like it gave me an this.

2561
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:03,990
Well,
yeah,

2562
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:05,110
an edge.
But it also,

2563
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,440
I felt like there was,
I was getting ahead of them,

2564
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:09,430
you know,
like,

2565
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:11,530
like it was,
it was some sort of a crazy race.

2566
02:00:11,710 --> 02:00:16,710
So for between the age of 15 and 21,
I was just completely obsessed with

2567
02:00:18,641 --> 02:00:20,770
fighting and that's all I did.
I just,

2568
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:22,090
I didn't,
I didn't know.

2569
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:24,730
I probably barely knew who was
president.

2570
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:27,460
I didn't know a goddamn thing about the
world.

2571
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:32,580
I wasn't reading shit unless it was like
some Samurai book on philosophy and

2572
02:00:32,741 --> 02:00:34,990
combat.
Like that was all I was obsessed with

2573
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:37,980
and that's when I was also a gun and
they were Ah,

2574
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:39,670
anthony robins somewhere around that
too.

2575
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:43,510
But I was interested in like things that
would give me an edge,

2576
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:47,350
personal development stuff that would
give me an edge and then through doing

2577
02:00:47,351 --> 02:00:49,120
martial arts and then also through
teaching,

2578
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,060
I think that was a big one was teaching
classes.

2579
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:56,170
And then teaching at bu was big too
because when I was teaching at Boston

2580
02:00:56,170 --> 02:00:57,580
University,
I was teaching an actual class.

2581
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:02,640
Are you teaching taekwondo window?
That was at that time I was a.

2582
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:06,240
I'd won the US Open.
I'd won a bunch of different tournaments

2583
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:10,090
and I was,
I was doing really well as a,

2584
02:01:10,091 --> 02:01:12,460
as a fighter,
as a martial arts competitor.

2585
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:13,750
So,
um,

2586
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:15,970
they had uh,
a taekwondo program at Bu and I was

2587
02:01:15,971 --> 02:01:19,750
teaching it and I would have to address
a whole class,

2588
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:22,090
but I would address all classes,
something that was really good at,

2589
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:25,180
like I knew I could demonstrate them to
them,

2590
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,490
some movements and stuff like that.
It shows some things.

2591
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:30,730
I'd asked someone to hold something and
I'd kick it or something like that and

2592
02:01:30,731 --> 02:01:31,870
they'd be like,
Holy Shit.

2593
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:33,830
And then they would listen.
Like I could get,

2594
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:36,760
I could,
I was confident in what I was saying

2595
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:37,623
there.

2596
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:41,600
And it was like the only time in my life
that I can remember being confident in

2597
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:45,110
telling people something.
It was like I would describe how you do

2598
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:46,850
it,
this is how you do it and I'll show you

2599
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:49,220
how to do it here,
but this is how it needs to be done.

2600
02:01:49,221 --> 02:01:51,320
And this is why.
And this is what happens when you do it.

2601
02:01:51,321 --> 02:01:53,900
And this is what's involved in the
mechanisms of your body.

2602
02:01:53,901 --> 02:01:56,210
And,
and so that,

2603
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:59,840
that gave me the first,
that was the first feeling that I got

2604
02:01:59,841 --> 02:02:01,690
were there,
was I,

2605
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:04,520
I knew that there was like a light at
the end of the tunnel or at least I

2606
02:02:04,521 --> 02:02:07,070
knew,
well at least this now I don't feel like

2607
02:02:07,071 --> 02:02:07,904
a loser anymore.

2608
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:10,060
Yeah,
yeah.

2609
02:02:10,150 --> 02:02:12,670
It gave you something to like,
like you said,

2610
02:02:12,671 --> 02:02:16,270
be exceptional at.
And I think that's what gives us

2611
02:02:16,271 --> 02:02:20,530
confidence is feeling like we've
somewhat mastered something like

2612
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:24,850
somewhat really could understand
something well enough to teach it.

2613
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:28,780
Yes.
And without that we're just chasing it I

2614
02:02:28,781 --> 02:02:32,680
think for and trying to get it through
little things we do.

2615
02:02:32,681 --> 02:02:35,070
And I think that's why a lot of people
like go from career to career,

2616
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:37,240
job to job or whatever.
Trying to find that little bit of

2617
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:40,600
instead of sticking with something and
like really focusing in on really

2618
02:02:40,601 --> 02:02:42,400
studying it.
And that's where I think the obsession

2619
02:02:42,401 --> 02:02:44,320
actually served in a lot of ways.

2620
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:47,300
I think for sure.
This is also an expression that I love

2621
02:02:47,301 --> 02:02:50,900
to use that martial arts are a vehicle
for developing your human potential

2622
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:53,210
because.
Because it's so difficult and it's so

2623
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:56,740
terrifying,
and then the idea of competing and in

2624
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:59,900
the physical consequences are so
devastating.

2625
02:02:59,901 --> 02:03:03,050
If you get hit that you are,
you can't,

2626
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:05,900
you can't have asset,
you can't slack off,

2627
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,240
you have to.
You have to really pursue this thing

2628
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:12,620
with an insanity,
like an incredible intensity and then

2629
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:13,580
through that you realize like,
oh,

2630
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:16,760
I could do that.
And then from doing that you kind of

2631
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:17,241
realized,
well,

2632
02:03:17,241 --> 02:03:22,241
what if I apply that to writing a book
or doing that or learning how to do

2633
02:03:22,671 --> 02:03:24,590
something else,
or for me it was standup comedy.

2634
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:25,900
Wow.
That seat,

2635
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:28,850
standup comedy seems just terrifying to
me.

2636
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:30,290
Karen

2637
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:32,990
terrifying is working in a fucking
office wearing tassels,

2638
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:34,890
shiny shoes.

2639
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:37,550
That's very true.
Stupid thing.

2640
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:39,520
Socks are too.
Yeah.

2641
02:03:39,521 --> 02:03:41,650
That was terrifying for me to.
Oh God.

2642
02:03:41,651 --> 02:03:45,850
I remember like Sunday nights I would
just get knots in my stomach just like,

2643
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:50,170
oh,
do I have to go and be in awful staff

2644
02:03:50,171 --> 02:03:55,120
meetings on Monday mornings?
And just like draining all sucking the

2645
02:03:55,121 --> 02:04:00,121
oxygen out of their own life out of.
That's where a lot of people start

2646
02:04:00,431 --> 02:04:01,900
taking medication.
Yep.

2647
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:03,180
Yep.

2648
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:07,380
That unhappiness of,
of just what you call quote unquote real

2649
02:04:07,381 --> 02:04:10,320
life,
there's been a structure that's put in

2650
02:04:10,321 --> 02:04:15,321
place that we've all sort of shuffled
into that doesn't serve us and it

2651
02:04:15,961 --> 02:04:18,780
doesn't serve most people.
You have Wim Hoff on last night,

2652
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:21,160
you know,
he is a telling me about him.

2653
02:04:21,510 --> 02:04:23,370
He's amazing,
but one of the things he and I were

2654
02:04:23,371 --> 02:04:24,090
talking about,
he was.

2655
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:26,100
He gave me his number about what did he
say?

2656
02:04:26,101 --> 02:04:28,260
Like seven percent of people or
something like that.

2657
02:04:28,261 --> 02:04:30,450
Do things that are creative with her
life.

2658
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:31,970
What?
Seven percent,

2659
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:34,000
70 percent world.
I don't know.

2660
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,900
Let's,
let's get crazy and say it's 15 percent.

2661
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:39,390
That's really small.
It is.

2662
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:40,260
Well,
here's the thing.

2663
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:42,510
One hundred percent of kids are
creative.

2664
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:44,550
It's true.
Like my kids,

2665
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:46,470
they're both.
They're both always do.

2666
02:04:46,471 --> 02:04:50,160
My young kids,
they're both always painting or drawing

2667
02:04:50,161 --> 02:04:52,290
or doing something in my older kid does
music,

2668
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:57,620
so there's so much creativity that they,
they feel drawn to it and all that stuff

2669
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:02,870
is something that every kid does.
Yep.

2670
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:05,730
Every kid draws shit.
Every kid plays with clay.

2671
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:09,820
Every kid make stuff with legos.
You all like put things together,

2672
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:12,450
you mind,
but somewhere along the line we're

2673
02:05:12,451 --> 02:05:15,390
stuffed into this structure that doesn't
serve us.

2674
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:20,130
Then if we feel like we have to do it
because we've been shuffled through

2675
02:05:20,131 --> 02:05:24,420
school and into college and then we're
in debt and then we have to take

2676
02:05:24,421 --> 02:05:27,690
opportunities and these opportunities is
a good opportunity,

2677
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:28,800
you know?
It's a good,

2678
02:05:28,801 --> 02:05:29,970
good career.
Yep.

2679
02:05:30,730 --> 02:05:32,650
It's horrific.
It is an end like,

2680
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:34,330
to go back to what you were saying
earlier,

2681
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:37,720
like these,
these systems that we've built are so

2682
02:05:37,721 --> 02:05:42,721
antiquated and so outdated from politics
to the school system and it all needs

2683
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:46,850
change and we're seeing it start to,
you know,

2684
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:49,630
ever seen it start to.
I think that the way we educate kids,

2685
02:05:49,631 --> 02:05:52,420
the way we relate to add and all these
things,

2686
02:05:52,421 --> 02:05:56,920
I think so much of add is like the
current system and the way kids are like

2687
02:05:56,950 --> 02:06:01,630
confined in this classroom and have to
follow these rules and sit still all day

2688
02:06:01,631 --> 02:06:04,600
like it.
There's no nurturing of creativity.

2689
02:06:04,630 --> 02:06:05,810
Right?
Um,

2690
02:06:05,950 --> 02:06:09,250
so I think over time a lot of this is
going to start to change.

2691
02:06:09,251 --> 02:06:13,400
I hope so because we just can't squat.
I see this with kids all.

2692
02:06:13,410 --> 02:06:15,820
I have three nephews and I see the same
thing.

2693
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:17,920
They're so creative and they're
confident.

2694
02:06:17,921 --> 02:06:19,600
They don't care what other people think
of them,

2695
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:21,370
you know,
they don't have a lot of fear.

2696
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:23,740
They and,
and when they do do something creative,

2697
02:06:23,741 --> 02:06:24,880
they don't judge it and go,
oh,

2698
02:06:24,881 --> 02:06:28,450
is it good?
Like they just enjoy the process and

2699
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:31,870
that starts to phase out as we get older
and we get obsessed with other people

2700
02:06:31,871 --> 02:06:35,920
thinking isn't good enough and is this
safe and will this please my parents and

2701
02:06:36,190 --> 02:06:37,870
like,
will I be able to make money this way?

2702
02:06:37,871 --> 02:06:42,871
And we just get so disconnected from
that childlike creativity and wonder and

2703
02:06:42,941 --> 02:06:46,750
curiosity and,
and kind of no fear and faith in

2704
02:06:46,751 --> 02:06:50,530
ourselves that we just get stuck in this
kind of checklist.

2705
02:06:51,070 --> 02:06:52,420
Tassel wearing life.

2706
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:55,000
I think it's another tassels,
tassels,

2707
02:06:55,001 --> 02:06:58,210
our enemy.
I think there's another thing that we

2708
02:06:58,211 --> 02:07:00,550
need to consider and this is really
important to people that are like,

2709
02:07:00,551 --> 02:07:01,540
well,
this is bullshit,

2710
02:07:01,541 --> 02:07:04,240
dreamer talk.
Listen to this because this is real.

2711
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:08,170
That corporate worlds only been around
for less than 100 years.

2712
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:13,590
This is a new thing in modern life and
modern life is new in terms of the

2713
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:17,530
length of time human beings have been
alive.

2714
02:07:18,070 --> 02:07:23,070
This is a new thing and it doesn't serve
us and maybe with technological

2715
02:07:24,611 --> 02:07:28,480
innovation and robots and automation and
all the different shit that's coming

2716
02:07:28,481 --> 02:07:30,580
down the line,
maybe there'll be less and less

2717
02:07:30,581 --> 02:07:33,160
opportunities for you to work a slave
job and you'll have to do something

2718
02:07:33,161 --> 02:07:35,260
creative.
It will be more and more compelling,

2719
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:40,950
but this world that we've structured
that doesn't serve us is incredibly

2720
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:44,710
recent and it's not.
It's not rigid.

2721
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,470
Like you don't have to do it.
Right,

2722
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,490
right.
But it seems like you do.

2723
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:51,370
It seems like you do.
What's actually really cool about

2724
02:07:51,371 --> 02:07:52,760
millennials,
you know this,

2725
02:07:52,850 --> 02:07:57,450
the generation that's now like 20 to 35,
36 ish.

2726
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:01,000
That's one of the things I talk about is
generational diversity and millennials

2727
02:08:01,001 --> 02:08:05,020
and they're demanding a different kind
of workplace.

2728
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:08,890
They're more likely to take a job where
they have more creativity.

2729
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:13,270
The culture is like less cubical base.
They have more freedom than a job with

2730
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:18,130
the salary and the benefits and they're
not relating to work in the same way.

2731
02:08:18,131 --> 02:08:20,540
They're really questioning the old
paradigms there.

2732
02:08:21,190 --> 02:08:24,220
I don't understand like why do I have to
be there from nine to five if I can like

2733
02:08:24,221 --> 02:08:25,690
get this done at home,
you know,

2734
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:28,870
a certain amount of time and a lot more
of them are starting their own

2735
02:08:28,871 --> 02:08:31,210
businesses and doing the more
traditional path.

2736
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:36,220
So I think we're already starting to see
it change because we have a generation

2737
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:38,080
that's huge.
I mean the millennial generation is

2738
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:42,550
ginormous and there they are demanding
different things from work and making

2739
02:08:42,551 --> 02:08:44,950
different choices already.
So it's already shifting.

2740
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:46,040
Already shifting.

2741
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:47,780
Yeah.
I also think another thing that's

2742
02:08:47,781 --> 02:08:51,920
bullshit is the amount of time that's
required to make a living just to

2743
02:08:51,921 --> 02:08:56,030
survive.
I mean how many people are barely being

2744
02:08:56,031 --> 02:08:59,750
able to feed themselves and housed
themselves and they're giving up their

2745
02:08:59,751 --> 02:09:03,140
entire day and their entire week and you
get.

2746
02:09:03,170 --> 02:09:05,420
If you're lucky,
you get that Saturday,

2747
02:09:05,421 --> 02:09:07,760
Sunday off,
but most of the time on Saturday and

2748
02:09:07,761 --> 02:09:11,180
Sunday if you have an office job,
you have some shit that you brought home

2749
02:09:11,181 --> 02:09:12,590
with you that you have to sort through.

2750
02:09:13,310 --> 02:09:17,150
Yeah,
that it's the whole payment systems

2751
02:09:17,151 --> 02:09:22,151
crazy and you see like these instead of
celebrities making all this money just

2752
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:27,320
by posting pictures and you've got
somebody going to a job like nine to

2753
02:09:27,321 --> 02:09:29,720
five day after day after day,
barely scraping by.

2754
02:09:29,721 --> 02:09:31,220
It's just,
I don't know.

2755
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:35,630
Well what freaks me out as people that
just move money around and they make

2756
02:09:35,631 --> 02:09:38,390
billions.
Like think about like hedge fund people

2757
02:09:38,391 --> 02:09:39,600
and people that like,
what are you doing?

2758
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:43,550
You're moving numbers around and you're
making numbers and how much,

2759
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:47,330
how much are you extracting while you're
moving stuff around.

2760
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:51,350
It's the like.
I had this conversation with this woman

2761
02:09:51,351 --> 02:09:54,830
who was a staunch Republican who was
telling me that the minimum wage,

2762
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:58,250
I was so ridiculous.
She was so adamant that you can't raise

2763
02:09:58,251 --> 02:09:59,570
the minimum wage.
I'm like,

2764
02:09:59,571 --> 02:10:00,860
why not?
She's like,

2765
02:10:00,870 --> 02:10:03,610
was $15 an hour?
It would crush businesses.

2766
02:10:03,611 --> 02:10:04,820
It would do this or do that.
I'm like,

2767
02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:07,310
well,
other people disagree like you don't

2768
02:10:07,311 --> 02:10:08,720
know whether or not that is.
I go,

2769
02:10:08,721 --> 02:10:11,240
do you want to work for less than 15
bucks an hour?

2770
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,051
She's like,
well,

2771
02:10:12,051 --> 02:10:13,710
these are entry level jobs and this and
that.

2772
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:16,850
I'm good.
You're still requiring an hour of

2773
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:19,280
someone's time.
If your job,

2774
02:10:19,310 --> 02:10:21,770
if you ever,
if you have a business and your business

2775
02:10:21,771 --> 02:10:24,740
can't pay someone $15 for an hour of
their time,

2776
02:10:24,890 --> 02:10:28,040
your business is bullshit.
It's bullshit.

2777
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:30,350
Or you have too many employees or
you're,

2778
02:10:30,351 --> 02:10:31,250
you know,
you're not,

2779
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:35,450
it's not set up right,
but you're the person who's at the

2780
02:10:35,451 --> 02:10:38,210
lowest rung of the food chain to take
the hit.

2781
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:41,030
Not The business.
Like if you have a business,

2782
02:10:41,031 --> 02:10:44,630
you came and pay someone $15 for a whole
hour of working.

2783
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:47,170
How much money are you generating and
why do you need all this business and

2784
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:49,190
why don't you know as employees do it
yourself.

2785
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:51,230
It's not,
it's not an efficient business and I

2786
02:10:51,231 --> 02:10:54,320
wonder what's going to happen with
automation and with,

2787
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:55,201
you know,
they're,

2788
02:10:55,201 --> 02:11:00,080
they're talking about like a tremendous
amount of jobs that are being done right

2789
02:11:00,081 --> 02:11:04,460
now by people that are going to be done
by robots and it's just a matter of

2790
02:11:04,461 --> 02:11:05,250
time.

2791
02:11:05,250 --> 02:11:07,740
Yeah.
So it's even more important to nurture

2792
02:11:07,741 --> 02:11:12,120
your creativity and know what you can do
besides rely on the man or the

2793
02:11:12,121 --> 02:11:15,360
corporation or whatever it is.
Because I think a lot of people think

2794
02:11:15,361 --> 02:11:20,361
that safety and economic security is in
that is in working for someone else and

2795
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,833
working for a quarter,

2796
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:24,700
getting a good job of climbing the
ladder.

2797
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:29,170
Shoot your brains out,
jumping off a building.

2798
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:31,530
Yeah.
It's just,

2799
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:33,630
we don't have that much time.
This is,

2800
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,250
this is not,
this is not a long run.

2801
02:11:36,580 --> 02:11:39,770
It's really not.
It goes by really some 49 and I feel

2802
02:11:39,771 --> 02:11:41,920
like it was 20 yesterday.
It just,

2803
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:44,890
it just happens.
And next thing you know,

2804
02:11:44,891 --> 02:11:47,320
I'll be 59 and next thing you know,
I'll be 69.

2805
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:50,380
You know,
and I'll be able to close my eyes and

2806
02:11:50,381 --> 02:11:53,200
hear the yawning grave.
It's coming.

2807
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:55,360
It's coming for all of us.
Yep.

2808
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:58,060
You gotTa have fun.
GotTa have fun while you're here.

2809
02:11:58,450 --> 02:11:59,710
If in any way possible.

2810
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:03,070
I agree.
I always say that I think regret is far

2811
02:12:03,071 --> 02:12:08,071
worse than risk far like I,
I'd rather take risks in my life than

2812
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:14,460
regret playing it safe or staying in
situations that I knew weren't,

2813
02:12:16,150 --> 02:12:16,961
you know,
for me,

2814
02:12:16,961 --> 02:12:19,180
I mean it.
It's scary.

2815
02:12:19,181 --> 02:12:21,550
Yeah.
And there's no guarantee,

2816
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:23,320
but at least you do it.

2817
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:24,770
That's where she comes from.
The.

2818
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:25,653
Yeah,
exactly.

2819
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:27,450
Like the scary stuff.
Like,

2820
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:29,170
Ugh,
that's what forces you to move.

2821
02:12:29,171 --> 02:12:31,330
And that's what gets things done.
Exactly.

2822
02:12:31,420 --> 02:12:34,600
Every two years I throw away my act and
I write a new one.

2823
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:35,860
Yeah.
I do a special,

2824
02:12:35,861 --> 02:12:38,680
like my netflix special.
I abandoned all those jokes and I have

2825
02:12:38,681 --> 02:12:41,980
to write a whole new one.
Fucking terrifying.

2826
02:12:42,390 --> 02:12:46,260
It's the worst,
but I keep doing it and every time I do

2827
02:12:46,270 --> 02:12:47,103
it,
it gets better.

2828
02:12:47,410 --> 02:12:49,440
If I keep doing it,
I keep focusing on it.

2829
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:52,300
I'm all that terror and fear of taking
that chance.

2830
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:55,720
It makes,
makes me get better at it and that's a

2831
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:59,890
pretty minor thing because it's not like
that much financial concern and I'll be

2832
02:12:59,891 --> 02:13:02,950
okay,
but for someone to take a chance

2833
02:13:03,130 --> 02:13:06,320
financially and take a chance their
future and they don't really know what,

2834
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:08,710
what the future holds.
It's not like they have all these things

2835
02:13:08,711 --> 02:13:11,890
to fall back on.
That's when you fucking dig.

2836
02:13:11,891 --> 02:13:15,350
In fact,
that's when you make things happen and

2837
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:16,510
if you don't,
you just.

2838
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:19,720
You just.
You just stay soft and lazy.

2839
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:22,870
Yeah.
Then you never really discover your true

2840
02:13:22,871 --> 02:13:26,170
potential.
If you just stay comfortable.

2841
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:28,790
Christina's people out there right now
that are listening,

2842
02:13:29,150 --> 02:13:30,770
that are getting fired up there.
Listen this right now,

2843
02:13:30,771 --> 02:13:32,460
they're jogging in place and you're
like,

2844
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:35,160
God damn it.
I don't want to listen to Christine.

2845
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,260
Take a chance.
It's good,

2846
02:13:38,270 --> 02:13:38,881
right?
Yeah,

2847
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:40,770
it's really good.
It's really good,

2848
02:13:40,830 --> 02:13:42,780
but don't just like you just broke the
letter.

2849
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:46,920
Can you really end it?
But don't feel motivated,

2850
02:13:46,921 --> 02:13:51,921
like actually like commit to one thing.
What's one thing you can do to start

2851
02:13:53,041 --> 02:13:55,530
shifting your life?
Is it,

2852
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:57,510
like I said,
finding that hobby?

2853
02:13:57,511 --> 02:13:59,760
Is it like having a conversation with
your boss?

2854
02:13:59,761 --> 02:14:01,470
Is it going after that creative
endeavor,

2855
02:14:01,471 --> 02:14:03,450
like just start.
That's the other thing.

2856
02:14:03,451 --> 02:14:07,350
Like people think they have to know all
the steps.

2857
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:09,300
It's like I want to get to the second
floor,

2858
02:14:09,301 --> 02:14:13,350
I'm at the bottom of the staircase and
like I think I just have to jump to get

2859
02:14:13,351 --> 02:14:14,220
there.
No,

2860
02:14:14,221 --> 02:14:17,490
like you go step by step by step,
just like you'd walk up the staircase so

2861
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:20,970
you don't have to know it all at once.
It's just taking that first step and

2862
02:14:20,971 --> 02:14:23,220
then that leads to another and that
leads to another and like you said,

2863
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:26,130
like it's so scary moments where you
find your grit and you find your

2864
02:14:26,131 --> 02:14:29,820
potential and you find out how you
respond to adversity and you find your

2865
02:14:29,821 --> 02:14:32,970
true gifts and you can only do that in
uncertainty and when you're

2866
02:14:32,971 --> 02:14:35,430
uncomfortable,
maybe she'd be a clarity advisor.

2867
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:37,930
The clarity advisor,
like of psychic.

2868
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:38,411
No,
no,

2869
02:14:38,411 --> 02:14:39,270
no.
Clarity.

2870
02:14:39,330 --> 02:14:40,163
Clarity.
Yeah.

2871
02:14:40,570 --> 02:14:44,120
What a psychic wouldn't be a cleric.
This is my new.

2872
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:44,911
Oh,
Gotcha.

2873
02:14:44,911 --> 02:14:46,900
Gotcha.
I clarity advisor.

2874
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:48,440
That's good.
I like that.

2875
02:14:48,441 --> 02:14:50,880
It's a little wordy.
It's not perfect.

2876
02:14:50,990 --> 02:14:54,120
It's we're getting closer to step step.

2877
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:57,310
There's something there like you're.
You don't.

2878
02:14:57,320 --> 02:14:59,730
One thing that I tell people that I
think is really important,

2879
02:14:59,731 --> 02:15:03,450
it's helped me a lot,
is write the things down that you need

2880
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:07,640
to do.
Make a checklist as far as your day like

2881
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:12,120
the best way to get shit done is to
stare that Goddamn list and say,

2882
02:15:12,121 --> 02:15:12,871
all right,
today,

2883
02:15:12,871 --> 02:15:14,490
did I work out?
Did I write?

2884
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:15,960
Did I do this?
Did I do that?

2885
02:15:15,961 --> 02:15:17,760
Then take care of that stuff,
right?

2886
02:15:17,761 --> 02:15:20,430
All that stuff that you need to do,
do it at the beginning of the day or do

2887
02:15:20,431 --> 02:15:24,000
it when you go to bed at night,
sometimes even better before you go to

2888
02:15:24,001 --> 02:15:26,100
bed at night.
Set your intention for the next day.

2889
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:27,540
Say,
I'm going to get all this shit done

2890
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,860
right out.
Give Yourself Fifteen,

2891
02:15:28,861 --> 02:15:30,120
20 minutes.
You have it.

2892
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:34,530
Everybody's got 15 minutes and then
write it down,

2893
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:36,900
put it,
put it on a piece of paper and the next

2894
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:38,540
day check that shit off.
Yeah.

2895
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:42,120
Do those things and if you could just
get in the habit of doing that.

2896
02:15:42,121 --> 02:15:45,360
It's so easy to avoid because people
love to just be lazy.

2897
02:15:46,030 --> 02:15:48,390
They love the distraction of doing
nothing

2898
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:49,440
insane.
They don't have time.

2899
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:51,400
Yes,
and saying they don't have time,

2900
02:15:51,401 --> 02:15:54,130
but.
But that is one that has been incredibly

2901
02:15:54,131 --> 02:15:58,780
beneficial to me is writing things down
and making a list and forcing myself to

2902
02:15:59,110 --> 02:16:00,730
check all the shit off.
It's on that list.

2903
02:16:00,790 --> 02:16:02,080
Yeah,
and doing the things you don't always

2904
02:16:02,081 --> 02:16:05,230
feel like doing and and also being
accountable that people like having

2905
02:16:05,231 --> 02:16:07,000
somebody that's like calling you and
being like,

2906
02:16:07,001 --> 02:16:08,740
did you do it?
Like did you do it?

2907
02:16:08,830 --> 02:16:11,170
Did you show up for yourself because it
takes momentum.

2908
02:16:11,570 --> 02:16:13,810
You are they making these kinds of
changes?

2909
02:16:13,811 --> 02:16:17,560
You have to build momentum and if you
have that checklist and you're doing

2910
02:16:17,561 --> 02:16:19,990
that,
that one thing every day and maybe the

2911
02:16:19,991 --> 02:16:22,720
first thing you're going to do is commit
to making a list everyday.

2912
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:26,170
That's a great step.
Once you start showing up for yourself

2913
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:28,750
every day and doing that and checking
things off the list,

2914
02:16:28,751 --> 02:16:30,940
you start build self trust.
You start to have more integrity with

2915
02:16:30,941 --> 02:16:32,890
yourself.
You start to build momentum and then

2916
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:35,740
it's easy to take the next step and do
the next thing,

2917
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,770
but without that momentum and without
that commitment,

2918
02:16:38,771 --> 02:16:43,771
I think people just expect their life to
change like this and like we've talked

2919
02:16:44,501 --> 02:16:46,630
about this a lot,
like it just doesn't,

2920
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:50,770
but those little steps,
they start to make you feel better too

2921
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:53,230
because you start to feel like,
oh my gosh,

2922
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:57,790
I'm not doing the same thing over and
over because that really is insanity.

2923
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:00,970
But went on Einstein,
who said insanity is doing the same

2924
02:17:00,971 --> 02:17:03,130
thing over and over again expecting a
different result.

2925
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:05,560
I think it was like that.
That to me is crazy.

2926
02:17:05,561 --> 02:17:06,340
Making

2927
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:11,050
it is and also there's a thing that
people have to be aware of in that is

2928
02:17:11,051 --> 02:17:15,370
the trap of falling back into old
patterns because they offer you comfort.

2929
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:17,710
That happens to a lot of people that
want to lose weight.

2930
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:19,960
Losing weight is a big one.
They start,

2931
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:22,330
they start off good,
they start losing weight,

2932
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:25,990
they start looking great,
and then somewhere along the line,

2933
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:29,780
that old pattern calls to them,
this is how I'm fucking

2934
02:17:29,810 --> 02:17:30,491
donut,
man.

2935
02:17:30,491 --> 02:17:33,900
You've won or you've earned a donut
krispy kremes get a couple of them and

2936
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:37,120
some big deal tomorrow you get back on a
track and you just never do.

2937
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:39,790
You never get back on track and it's,
it's,

2938
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:43,210
it's really common for people,
whether it's cigarette smoking or you

2939
02:17:43,211 --> 02:17:43,991
know,
fill in the blank,

2940
02:17:43,991 --> 02:17:47,830
whatever it is.
Old Patterns are really hard.

2941
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:52,480
They're really hard to avoid because
they offer some sort of bizarre comfort.

2942
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:54,940
Yeah.
They're like coping strategies and so

2943
02:17:54,941 --> 02:17:58,360
many ways.
I mean so many people eat or smoke or

2944
02:17:58,361 --> 02:18:03,361
whatever for comfort or to self soothe
themselves and so they can either make a

2945
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:06,820
new year's resolution and lose the
weight and then if they haven't found

2946
02:18:06,821 --> 02:18:11,380
another way to cope with life when
things get hard or

2947
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:16,060
someone upsets them or whatever,
they were going to turn to that old

2948
02:18:16,061 --> 02:18:21,040
coping device because they haven't dealt
with the issue underneath what made them

2949
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:23,230
overeat or drink or smoke in the first
place.

2950
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:27,400
Yeah,
and it's also when you're filled with

2951
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:30,370
angst and she's.
All these things are fucked up in your

2952
02:18:30,371 --> 02:18:32,080
life.
There's something about those old

2953
02:18:32,081 --> 02:18:34,060
patterns like give you a big hug.

2954
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:38,200
Yeah,
they do that like a warm fuzzy blanket,

2955
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:41,020
but it's really disgusting.
Covered with bacteria.

2956
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:43,653
Good way to look at it.

2957
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:47,440
If people want to get ahold of you,
how do they do that?

2958
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:48,303
How do they go about that?

2959
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:49,870
Oh,
well,

2960
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:53,080
expectation hangover is my last book.

2964
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:01,860
That's not even a long name.

2965
02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:05,140
I know.
It's just too long for twitter.

2966
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:07,230
I'll take it up with twitter.
So how's,

2973

2974
