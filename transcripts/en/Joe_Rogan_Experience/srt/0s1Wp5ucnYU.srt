1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,010
Oh my God.

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,281
Yeah,

4
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,114
they're,

5
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,230
they're little helicopter.

6
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,390
What the fuck did people do
before they figured out tents?

7
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,160
Uh,

8
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:09,060
well the Eskimos,

9
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,050
I believe that they smeared
fat on their skin that would,

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,600
certain kinds of fat would
keep the mosquitoes off them.

11
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,560
I think got all sorts of
really clever adaptations.

12
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,394
You know,

13
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:20,851
you know,

14
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:21,121
we,

15
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,640
we sort of assume that
we would be helpless,

16
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:27,060
but that's because we didn't grow
up there and our culture didn't,

17
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:27,510
you know.

18
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:27,880
Right.

19
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,710
So there's,

20
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,011
you know who,

21
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,550
Wade Davis is a,

22
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,050
he's a,

23
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,580
he's an anthropologist.

24
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,540
He's written a bunch of books.

25
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,530
Really interesting guy.

26
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:34,831
He's,

27
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:35,400
um,

28
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,780
like anthropologists in residents
at the Smithsonian in Washington.

29
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,320
He wrote a book called the wayfarers
I think was his last book about

30
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,154
traditional,

31
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,581
like,

32
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,400
about how these guys could
navigate across the Pacific.

33
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,050
Just looking at the stars and the color
of the water and smelling and whatever

34
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,884
they'd,

35
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,461
anyway,

36
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:53,821
he,

37
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,120
uh,

38
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,310
one of the stories he tells us about this,

39
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,090
uh,

40
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,050
Eskimo guy,

41
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,610
old guy,

42
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,280
and the family sort of took the
keys to the car away from him.

43
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,481
Like,

44
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,870
you can't go anymore.

45
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,310
They were afraid he would go
out and die the traditional way.

46
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,430
When Eskimo people got old,

47
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,840
they would just like wander
off into the ice and die.

48
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,090
So as not to be a burden to the family.

49
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,900
Right.

50
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,300
And he was a traditional guy and they
were worried that he would take the,

51
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,400
the snow machine out and just die out
there somewhere or hurt himself hunting or

52
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,234
whatever.

53
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,660
So they had this whole intervention.

54
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,420
And so that night he goes out,

55
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,980
gets out of the house,

56
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,500
takes a shit in his hand,

57
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,380
forms the shit into a knife,

58
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:42,381
blade spits on it and the spit a is
freezing along the edge and he hones that

59
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:45,571
down.

60
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,030
So he gets a nice sharp
edge with his sped,

61
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,460
takes his shit knife,

62
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,630
kills a dog or a couple
of dogs and takes their,

63
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,440
uh,

64
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,170
ribs and makes us a sled out of it.

65
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,680
And with the sinews and whatever
other pieces of the dogs,

66
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:01,861
you know,

67
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,720
he knew all this stuff from his childhood,

68
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,600
hooks up a couple of other dogs to
the sled and he takes off into the,

69
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,600
into the snow on his,

70
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,853
you know,

71
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,540
sled with his shit knife.

72
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,423
Wow.

73
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,160
Oh my God.

74
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,420
That might be the most of the
same story I've ever heard.

75
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,490
We didn't know any better.

76
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,360
Yeah,

77
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,800
we didn't know any better idiots.

78
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,240
We were like 1920 that we,

79
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,130
we used to fucking go out and drink like
a 12 pack of beer and eat McDonald's at

80
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:28,820
one in the morning.

81
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,040
And by like eight o'clock
we were unloading trucks,

82
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,903
fine,

83
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,160
laughing and then we would work.

84
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,850
We do all this shit and that during
the lunch hour we would go out and play

85
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,360
basketball and like just regular
sneakers and like five o one blues.

86
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,490
Remember that the black
fly and you'd be out there.

87
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,020
You come back and pouring
sweat and then just keep,

88
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,100
it's in great shape.

89
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,780
I was ever in it my life.

90
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,950
And then in the end of work I would
then go lift and go ride a bike.

91
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,540
Dude,

92
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,140
I'm at one time I want
a bike ride hammered.

93
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,800
I was so into working
out fucking bike ride.

94
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,310
I'm on like a 12 speed bike that I bought
when I still have it by the way in my

95
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,710
garage I refuse to throw shit out and a,

96
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,100
I remember being hammered on the bike
and I'm sweating so I'm becoming more

97
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,934
hammered.

98
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,710
I was going to do this 11 mile loop and
then it became oh seven and then I just

99
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:19,711
kinda came back and I was like on the
bike laughing and I was like 2021 and was

100
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,710
only beginning to understand the fragility
of life and I knew that what I was

101
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,330
doing was stupid,

102
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,164
but I couldn't get,

103
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:26,570
I,

104
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,010
I,

105
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,310
I just kept picturing my friends laughing
at me and I was literally by myself

106
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,001
riding this bike,

107
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,020
laughing drunk,

108
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,670
driving up the street

109
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,630
and you have a two and a half hours.

110
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,960
Like I'm just taking snippets
from fucking the eighties I got,

111
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,803
I got nothing left

112
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,400
used to be able to bounce back
so well when you're young,

113
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,360
it's amazing.

114
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,410
When you're 20 years old,

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,970
you get hammered the next day.

116
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:49,990
You barely feel anything.

117
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,333
Dude,

118
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,230
Donald's in tear down that place.

119
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,000
I would get to quarter
pounders with cheese,

120
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,050
a large fry,

121
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,060
a six piece mcnugget
and I never liked him.

122
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,110
I never liked him.

123
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,260
I never thought an ace to
try the different sauces.

124
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,440
I used to go with the mustard,

125
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,583
never tastes good.

126
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,110
I just wanted something to fill the void.

127
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,760
And then I would get like a
couple of cheeseburgers and uh,

128
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,100
I think it just a giant coke and just
throw that down and wake up the next day

129
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,970
with a flat stomach.

130
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:16,810
And I had already drank like,

131
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:17,110
you know,

132
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,291
eight,

133
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,124
nine beers.

134
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,323
We've got to fight.

135
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,370
We got into a fight one time right under
the Golden Arches and the next town

136
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,204
over.

137
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,681
I Dunno what happened.

138
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,730
These guys came in drunk,

139
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,720
classic Boston shift.

140
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,710
They just come walking in and,

141
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:30,940
and give everybody the finger.

142
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,810
Of course we respond to it
and next thing you know,

143
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,850
we're out underneath the golden arches.

144
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,310
There's like five of us in two of them.

145
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,930
And my buddy,

146
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:41,531
we always fought,

147
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,810
he starts swinging on the big
one and then the little one,

148
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,300
he sort of jumped and
it just became this big,

149
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,111
it looked like wrestling,

150
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:47,291
you know,

151
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,310
when like they all come running out of
the dressing and to help each other.

152
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:50,051
We're on snow,

153
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,550
everybody's drunk just fallen down.

154
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,900
We was so fucking drunk.

155
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,370
The cops were there sort
of misting mace for like,

156
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:57,430
and I don't know how long,

157
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,690
like we didn't even see him pull up
this just like being in the light.

158
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:05,380
Then all of a sudden everybody's like
eyes it like cheering up and shit.

159
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,560
And then what was hilarious was they
just broke us up and they fuck it.

160
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:14,830
And then like two seconds later we're
back in our car and the same two guys we

161
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,480
were fighting were coming
back up to the car and say,

162
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,370
what did the cops go?

163
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:19,204
I thought it was over.

164
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,411
And the guy's like,

165
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:21,510
that was a bullshit pudge.

166
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:22,390
I'm under the little one goes,

167
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:22,811
I said,

168
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:22,911
ma'am,

169
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:23,290
he goes,

170
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,030
we laugh at you a shit.

171
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,630
It was fucking nuts.

172
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,411
I gotta give it up to him.

173
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:32,710
And it was,

174
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,891
it was,

175
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,190
you know,

176
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,660
fucking four on two whatever.

177
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,420
And uh,

178
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,310
they didn't give a shit.

179
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,591
They laughed.

180
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:38,980
They definitely laughed at our shit.

181
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,820
They didn't care.

182
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,750
They ate that Mason,

183
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,471
they came right back.

184
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:46,360
They already right up to our
face right up to our Ford escort.

185
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,680
They did not give a fuck if you're still
into the fight and he just got amazed.

186
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,080
That's what you need.

187
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,690
That thing happened because I don't,

188
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,390
nobody got it full on.

189
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,400
Like it was just like you're,

190
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:56,581
I,

191
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,370
I thought we thought it was the snow.

192
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,340
Like they had thrown rock salt cause we
were on the ground and I don't know what

193
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:01,910
it was,

194
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,220
but it was just like
unbelievably fucking air.

195
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,054
But we were hammered.

196
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,390
That sounds like a fucking police
car pulled up and nobody noticed.

197
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,950
That's hilarious.

198
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
Whatever was going on.

199
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,360
What do you believe are the components of,

200
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,880
of dream telepathy?

201
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,220
Have you isolated it down to a certain,

202
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,990
firing the synapses?

203
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,381
Do you mean,

204
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,810
do you have any idea of what,

205
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:23,644
what causes it?

206
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,620
We have the equipment to do much more
with the brain now than we could.

207
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,430
You have to remember the parasite
ecologists don't have very much money and

208
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,380
don't have the tools to,

209
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,653
uh,

210
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,020
uh,

211
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,220
to utilize a lot of this equipment.

212
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,750
But what we did on our studies was very,

213
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:43,531
very simple.

214
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:48,531
The nights that the dreams hill apathy
seemed to be successful were the nights

215
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:52,380
that the geo magnetic fields
of the earth were very calm,

216
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,450
very few sunspots,

217
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,520
very few electrical storms.

218
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,120
And so one could hypothesize that there
is a field of some sort of global field

219
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,330
were these barely detectable influences
and very subtle means of communication

220
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:10,530
that can sneak through.

221
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,551
Also,

222
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:12,301
by and large,

223
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:17,301
if there is an emotional connection
between the people who are in contact with

224
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,840
each other over a distance,

225
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,140
it's more likely to happen than
if they're complete strangers.

226
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,770
Didn't you have some sort of a crazy
psychic vision of Kennedy being

227
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:29,994
assassinated?

228
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:31,541
Well,

229
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,630
actually I did the Alphas dre.

230
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,640
My very first silicide been experience
that I had the courtesy of Timothy leary

231
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,480
who I went to Harvard to visit and who
invited me to an experiment of silicide

232
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:52,841
mills was a beautiful and
glorious experience yet was
don during the days when

233
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:54,990
psilocybin was legal,

234
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:55,441
in fact,

235
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,270
as one of his last legal
siliciden sessions.

236
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,220
And there was only one Downer
during that experience.

237
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,490
And that was when I had the actual
decision during psilocybin with my eyes

238
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:12,400
closed of President Lincoln being shot.

239
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,730
And I saw the gun at the base of his
profile and somebody screamed out,

240
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:20,260
the president has been shot.

241
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,980
And then Lincoln space
morphed into that of Kennedy.

242
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,990
And there was the rifle,

243
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,890
except now it was not
a pistol as his rifle.

244
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:30,940
And somebody who's screaming,

245
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:32,350
the president has been shot.

246
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,390
I recorded all of that.

247
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,700
I had such an incredible experience.

248
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:40,120
I made dozens of copies and
Santa to my close friends.

249
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,570
And of course in several months the
tragedy of Kennedy's death actually

250
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:47,141
happened.

251
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:48,940
And so my vision,

252
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:51,220
whether it was coincidental
or pre-cognitive,

253
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,300
was on record.

254
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,180
And that'll be considered
myself a highly psychic person.

255
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,510
You don't consider yourself,

256
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,040
um,

257
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,460
did that freak you out at all?

258
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,990
Yeah.

259
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,381
No.

260
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,150
Nothing's preached me off in this field.

261
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:06,270
It's just a surprise at
sometimes leaves me a,

262
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:11,271
a sense of wonder because there's more
things going on in the world we don't

263
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,300
take seriously,

264
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,130
or they'll take us by surprise.

265
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,210
[inaudible].
