1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's do it for

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,410
one.
Boom.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,910
Hello Travis.
What's going on?

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,170
Thanks man.
Thanks for doing this.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,020
Really stoked to be here.
It's cool to have you.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,930
Hey.
So I wanted to talk about what we were

7
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,660
talking about right before we started.
I've always watched you play drums and

8
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,890
I'm like,
how the fuck does that guy's arms not

9
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:20,600
fall off?
I mean,

10
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:23,720
you,
you have so much repetitive motion.

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,150
I've never understood how you could do
that.

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,110
Just barely know.
I,

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,190
I pull this.
Pull this thing like write up like a

14
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:32,480
fist from your face.
There we go.

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,940
I always do battle ropes.
Oh,

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,721
okay.
That happened.

17
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,000
That must constantly.
I'll do 30 minutes.

18
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm not high intensity the whole time,
but just keep my shoulders and arms

19
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,400
moving as I prepare for a tour.
But yeah,

20
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:49,190
I think my risk,
my risk probably have gone through the

21
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,290
most hell over the years.

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,290
Like I just feel like just normal
people's risk strength that probably

23
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,540
don't have because there's been so much
grinding,

24
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:00,050
like they pop and oh Jesus,
you all sorts of weird things.

25
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:01,850
But yeah.
But I'm still,

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,980
you know,
I feel like because I do battle ropes

27
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,340
and because I box and the kind of
workout fast twitch muscles,

28
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:09,100
I really don't get tired.
That's,

29
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,490
it's amazing because so many people have
repetitive stress injuries.

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,070
I mean even secretaries,
they get carpal tunnel,

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,650
you know,
people get who write a lot,

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,700
get carpal tunnel.
Kids are getting injuries on their

33
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:22,220
thumbs from fucking around with their
phone too much.

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,140
Yeah.
I felt like when I smoked cigarettes a

35
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,800
lot,
I was feeling kind of the first symptoms

36
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,290
of that stuff and I wasn't drinking a
lot.

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,930
I was kind of a dumpster on tour,
you know,

38
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:35,750
not really taking care of my body and I
could really feel it.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,720
And then why are you still Vegan?
Yeah.

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,760
And you run that restaurant was
crossroads or it's one of your.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
One of the owners running it is saying a
lot.

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,590
I couldn't do that.
I shouldn't have said running.

43
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,200
No towel towel.
Ronan is the man.

44
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:55,330
He's like the Las Vegan chef ever.
And he's like an old punk rock hardcore

45
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,170
guy.
Like knew John Joseph.

46
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,560
John Joseph keeps trying to get me to go
there and I almost went last time he was

47
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:02,270
in town with them.
Next time I'm going to make it down

48
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:05,270
there.
I think probably 80,

49
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,410
90 percent of the people that eat there
aren't vegan because it's that good.

50
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,401
Yeah,
that's what I hear.

51
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,660
Dana White said that.
Yeah,

52
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,291
I.
Yeah,

53
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,270
Dana.
We usually have dinner there when he's

54
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,940
in town,
so I think for Dana to be able to sit

55
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:21,650
through it and enjoy it and Matt Serra,
I think he brought everyone for like,

56
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,600
I don't know if it was like fight
companion.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
It was like one of those was.
Yeah,

58
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:26,890
it was Dana White's looking for a fight.
Yeah,

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,150
Youtube show.
Yeah,

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,350
I was on tour but they facetime me from
there,

61
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,050
but yeah,
towel is a like a GE.

62
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,270
He's the best Vegan chef in the world by
far.

63
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,400
That's cool.
How did you get involved with that?

64
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,170
Is it what you.
Were you already,

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,680
you're cleaning your diet up because of
your,

66
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,090
your injuries or because you were trying
to keep your body tuned for drumming or

67
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,740
you just wanted to clean it up?
Period.

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,840
Now?
I was vegetarian since I was 13.

69
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,740
Really?
Yeah.

70
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,030
And then,
uh,

71
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,940
after my accident I was in the hospital.
Actually long story,

72
00:02:59,370 --> 00:02:59,980
I'll just sum

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,300
up into real plain piece.
Yeah.

74
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,700
And I had to eat meat in the hospital
because they didn't have any other kind

75
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,740
of Vegan options,
a protein,

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,560
Saudi bags of beef Jerky,
whatever.

77
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,590
They would give me whatever I could
stomach and not like kind of like think

78
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:19,591
about what I was eating because I wasn't
eating at all and I was just ditching my

79
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,220
food,
given it to my friends because I didn't

80
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,890
want to eat any of it and I got caught
so long story short,

81
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:28,891
a little bit of meat and in the hospital
and when I got out I just felt like the

82
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:33,580
next evolution of my eating would,
would try and be Vegan and it was so

83
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,130
easy in la because we have so many great
vegan restaurants.

84
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,383
So yeah,
that was,

85
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,490
that was pretty much it.
I was already Vegan.

86
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,440
I was actually at a bad brain show,
one of the best hardcore bands in the

87
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,970
world to ever,
ever do it.

88
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,700
And tell approached me.
They're saying,

89
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,280
hey,
I had this idea for a restaurant I'd

90
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,090
really like to beat you,
know,

91
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,170
you to be involved.
And I said,

92
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,120
say no more,
just tell me what you need.

93
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:59,980
Because I do think before of a weird
thing to approach someone with a man

94
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,980
thinking about open up a restaurant.
Yeah,

95
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,670
I need this drummer.
Yeah,

96
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,421
right.
No,

97
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,840
I think he was just reaching out to
friends and family because he was,

98
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,490
he was oprah's chef and he was ellen
degeneres chef and he was all these

99
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:13,750
like,
you know,

100
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,900
really high profile people is Vegan chef
when they would,

101
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,810
you know,
do a Vegan diet for however long.

102
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:20,950
Some,
some forever,

103
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,830
some just like a two week thing.
But uh,

104
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,920
I think he just got to the point where
he wants to do something for himself.

105
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,050
And then crossroads was born and I knew
how good he was.

106
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,270
So I just told him,
say no more,

107
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,010
tell me what you need from me and I'm
there.

108
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,840
And then it just,
you know,

109
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,350
I think it's been five years now.
Well it's got a fantastic reputation.

110
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,410
I know a bunch of people that have eaten
there and they love it.

111
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,680
Well it's not because of me,
it's because of talent is food for sure.

112
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,551
Yeah.
Talents.

113
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:49,250
Scott,
the Sh,

114
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,610
the chefs that are just,
you know,

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,560
the best know how hands on were you in
the,

116
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,500
were you just one of the people
promoting it?

117
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:01,501
Like how hands on were you with the
construction of it or nothing with like

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,210
the decor or anything.
He would run stuff by us like hey check

119
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,950
this out,
tell us what you guys think of this.

120
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,390
As you know there's basically menus
change every season so it's not the same

121
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,590
menu all year long.

122
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,040
So as we prepare for the next season's
menu,

123
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,590
he's like testing it on us,
the,

124
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,880
you know,
the season prior.

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,600
So he'll be bringing out dishes and,
and letting us try it.

126
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,340
But yeah,
he curates the whole thing.

127
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,800
That's interesting.
So when he gets his food,

128
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,800
when he's preparing his food,
is he getting his stuff directly from

129
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:30,850
farmers?
Like how,

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,550
how is he getting his food?
Yeah,

131
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,420
directly from farms.
Yeah.

132
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,450
So he has to curate these relationships
with these farmers and just like go

133
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,110
visit them and find out how they're
growing their food.

134
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,160
Yeah.
And,

135
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,580
and you know,
you'll be all set with a menu if it's

136
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,770
fall,
but then those same vegetables aren't in

137
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:52,180
season so he has to rethink everything
for the next season and not kinda repeat

138
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,310
himself.
So he really,

139
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,530
he's really got it down to a science.
And how long has he been Vegan for?

140
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,480
I don't know how long.

141
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,710
Tasmin Vegan.
I've never really asked because it's got

142
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:05,030
to be incredibly difficult to be a Vegan
chef.

143
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,040
I would imagine being a regular chef was
difficult.

144
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,490
But when you put all those restrictions,
you know,

145
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,520
and just have to make things taste
interesting and different and yeah,

146
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,650
I think that's where chef Scott comes in
because he's actually comes from a meat

147
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,830
background.
So he was working at Italian restaurants

148
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,410
in Italian,
Mediterranean restaurants that cooked

149
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,580
everything.
So it was infusing this Vegan obviously

150
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:31,730
like lifestyle of eating with,
you know,

151
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:35,810
chef Scott's tastes as well,
so I think he had to think that out to

152
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:39,410
where it would appeal in and mediators
would eat there too and not really

153
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:41,660
notice a difference because I agree,
you know,

154
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:45,810
sometimes I'll be on tour and you go to
a Vegan spot and I'll take my bus driver

155
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:47,780
ran or my,
whoever's traveling at me and they're

156
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,561
like,
oh man,

157
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,370
this is rough.

158
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,170
You know,
like they can't stand it.

159
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,320
Crossroads is not one of those spots
where you're thinking about like,

160
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,150
man,
I might not enjoy this meal.

161
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,630
There's some good spots in la.
Has some great spots you ever go to

162
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,610
follow your heart in the valley all the
time.

163
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,391
Great spot.
Yeah.

164
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,160
That's the spot.
Close to home that I love.

165
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,400
Like follow your heart.
A shout out to Erewhon.

166
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:12,401
Erewhon has like good vegan options.
A Chef Ito who has a spot in downtown

167
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,760
called Allach who took a vow of silence
22 years ago.

168
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,970
Yeah.
Well a special man.

169
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,910
Yeah.
Twenty two years ago took a Valla

170
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:23,450
silence.
And these done.

171
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,160
No more talking.
No more talking.

172
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,990
What in the fuck is that about?
Yeah.

173
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,160
So he just communicates if,
if he has a lot to say or write it down,

174
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,580
but you just read the lips and I know
what he's saying.

175
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,720
But he,
he shows up to.

176
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,130
Oh,
that's so crazy.

177
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,200
Yeah.
He takes a lot of photos so he'll show

178
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,970
up to like punk or rap,
whatever,

179
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:44,180
whatever show I'm playing.
He's in the pit with this camera,

180
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,400
this silent guy who doesn't say a word
and it's his cooking is phenomenal.

181
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,270
So.
But yeah,

182
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,800
La,
we're spoiled with great.

183
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,380
Great being in restaurants.
That's a fucking trip.

184
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,050
Twenty two years of no talking.
Yeah.

185
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:02,051
He also does like this juicing where
this year he juiced for 189 days with no

186
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,210
food.
Wow.

187
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,000
What did we get down to?
I think he was.

188
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,640
Yeah,
he lost about 20 something pounds.

189
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,580
Fuck yeah,
he does it every year.

190
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,290
Wow.
Yeah.

191
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,240
He's trying to vanish,
right?

192
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,590
Let's try to not talk.
I don't think I could do it.

193
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,850
Intermittent fasting is like as much as
I can do.

194
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,650
Yeah,
I do that every night,

195
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,910
but that's the vowel sciences frequently
that silence is freaking me out.

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Yeah.
He and I,

197
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,500
I've never really pried and kind of like
asked a bunch of questions.

198
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,090
Why?
Because they even have to write a lot.

199
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,380
Yeah,
that too,

200
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,690
but no,
I've been around when people ask him,

201
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:42,030
he just said he wanted a time out for 22
years.

202
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:43,550
Yeah,
that's a serious fucking time.

203
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:47,630
I don't know how old his homeboy.
He's got to be probably in his fifties,

204
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,370
so almost half his life.
Yeah,

205
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,270
what the fuck man.
But he spends Christmas with me,

206
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,470
spend Thanksgiving with my family and I.
Oh,

207
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:56,304
that's cool.

208
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,640
Everybody just smiles at them.
Yeah,

209
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,490
everyone just smiles and waves.
Basically.

210
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,640
He'd be a good guy to sit next to
someone who's on coke.

211
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,790
Totally.
They would just talk his ear off.

212
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,160
He just be sitting there all silent
night,

213
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,040
blah,
blah,

214
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,500
blah.
Fuck man.

215
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,570
That is.
I've never even heard of anything like

216
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,890
that.
Does he make any noises?

217
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,830
You Whistle?
No.

218
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,010
I've heard him snort one time when he
was laughing so hard,

219
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,670
but that was about as close as it gets,
so he doesn't laugh out loud like,

220
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,830
ha ha,
ha ha,

221
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,890
wow.
Nothing terrible comedy club audience

222
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,740
member.
Yeah,

223
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,713
it would be rough.

224
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,800
He has a march to.
It's called March of silence.

225
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:38,730
That happens once a year where you have
a bunch of them that basically,

226
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,340
you know,
that are basically marching for the

227
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,090
march of silence for like the cruelty of
animals and whatever else.

228
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,780
So I like to have him on the podcast to
see how long you talked to them for.

229
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,540
Yeah,
just to see what,

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,310
what it would be like.
That's so strange.

231
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,730
It sounds cool.
I love that there's people like that out

232
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:57,670
there though.
I do.

233
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,940
I love hearing those stories like the
world needs him.

234
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,100
You know,
like when you said that I got excited

235
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,140
and the guy has been salvatore.
I'm like,

236
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:05,100
Whoa,
you know,

237
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,410
there's something about that.
It makes you go wow.

238
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,490
I was talking Hella loud when I first
met him and he was like,

239
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,230
I can hear you,
you know,

240
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,380
because it was trying to wrap my head
around,

241
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,260
you know,
no one did an introduction going,

242
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,200
hey,
this guy's silent.

243
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,700
Oh,
they didn't tell you?

244
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,090
No,
I had no idea.

245
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:29,091
So I'm talking really loud and he like,
he like just whispers to me like mouse

246
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,180
to me.
I can hear you.

247
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,260
And I was like,
okay.

248
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,660
Then I just figured out over time.
Wow.

249
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,180
Silent by choice.
Who?

250
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,560
Yeah,
that's heavy.

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,950
What is he involved?
Like heavy meditation or Buddhism or

252
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,700
anything very strange like that?
Yeah,

253
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,200
he meditates.
I think he has like a lot of kind of

254
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,740
Buddhist,
a kind of qualities like kind of.

255
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,810
I think he,
if he had to lean in some kind of

256
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,120
religion or practice,
it would be that.

257
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,900
Wow.
Yeah,

258
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,950
that's intense.
That's a serious commitment,

259
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,950
man.
I couldn't even imagine going 22 days

260
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,590
without talking a day I think.
Any,

261
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,460
any,
anything?

262
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,340
I think we'd catch ourselves.
It being very hard.

263
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,860
I was going to get my tonsils and
adenoids removed because I have sleep

264
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,140
apnea because I have a fat neck.

265
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,540
But uh,
I found a mouthpiece that I couldn't

266
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,690
sleep with that keeps my tongue from
falling over because I have a.

267
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,390
When when your neck is thick,
your wind hole is smaller believer,

268
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:31,140
not because the more muscle you put it
in the small year your whole gets.

269
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,540
And then if you have a big tongue when
you lay back,

270
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,880
you can actually block your airway.
Wow.

271
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,580
Yeah.
And so friends that I know have had

272
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,620
their adenoids,
their tonsils removed,

273
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,750
and they actually take some of the soft
tissue out of your,

274
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,780
your passageway so you can breathe
easier.

275
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,740
But the problem is you can't talk for
like seven days.

276
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
Oh yeah.
That would probably be real for.

277
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:54,040
You may wonder if wide neck,
you know,

278
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,873
like the,
the,

279
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,280
the,
the Internet phenomenon has the same

280
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,140
problem.
I get like I must sleep terrible.

281
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,880
Yeah.
His neck starts up here.

282
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,460
It's crazy.
As next starts at the top of his ears

283
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,180
and works its way to his shoulders.
Tonsils out is a,

284
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,080
uh,
it's a bum out.

285
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,220
I did that.
Did you,

286
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,620
did you have taught politeness or
now you knew what I had is I had,

287
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,190
I was smoking tons of weed.
Right.

288
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,580
But I would smoke backwards,
like I love the woods.

289
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,520
So yeah,
everything is right here.

290
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,180
I got them right here.
Yeah.

291
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,600
So I'd smoke about 20,
20 backwards a day.

292
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,220
Yeah.
And I was recording an album with the

293
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,950
transplants and I turned to skinhead rob
and I was like,

294
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,830
Yo,
I think I think I have something like

295
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,780
something's lodged in my throat,
like I could barely breathe right now.

296
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,320
And um,
kept smoking,

297
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,190
didn't even,
you know,

298
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,020
didn't I didn't really know what was
going on.

299
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,560
And then I went to the hospital that
night and they rushed me to another

300
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,490
hospital to get my tonsils removed
because they were like twice the size of

301
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,670
they should be.
And then I had a throat infection and

302
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,490
then it comes to find out I had what's
called the bear to soft goods,

303
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:05,491
which is like precancer lining my
esophagus from smoking and I don't know,

304
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:10,000
I guess just abuse over the years.
So that was,

305
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,070
that's what led to my tonsils being
pulled out.

306
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,530
These are serious,
like when you think about this,

307
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:18,400
like you probably shouldn't smoke too
many of those because it's just plain

308
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:20,050
tobacco.
I love,

309
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,030
I love them though.
It got to the point where I couldn't

310
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:25,120
smoke joints.
I couldn't smoke out of a bong a pipe.

311
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,520
It had to be a backward.
That's where I am.

312
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,020
Yeah,
that's part of it.

313
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,820
I like them.
Did you ever smoke cigarettes?

314
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,040
No.
Cio date.

315
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,200
I smoked a lot of cigarettes and then I
quit smoking cigarettes.

316
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,920
Just smoked weed and then I discovered
backwoods and I was kinda getting a

317
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:41,980
little bit of both.
Still getting the tobacco that I missed.

318
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,140
Um,
but yeah,

319
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,720
yeah.
My friend already said that he started

320
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,060
smoking spliffs in England,
you know,

321
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,820
and when he was over in the UK,
the next,

322
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:55,690
the weed with tobacco and he got totally
hooked on tobacco again because he had

323
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:59,610
quit cigarettes for years and then he
started smoking the weed mixed with

324
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,230
tobacco and before he knew it he was
smoking cigarettes again.

325
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,450
Yeah.
So he smoked while he was over there and

326
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:07,220
then he quit soon as he was done.
And then came back to you.

327
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,081
US?
Yeah.

328
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,840
I feel like they just started smoking.
Just pure weed over there,

329
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,480
Jeffrey bearish for years.
It was both.

330
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,040
Yeah.
I don't understand that.

331
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,570
Like,
how'd that,

332
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,170
how'd that work out over there?
Yeah.

333
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,030
So illegal over there too.
It's like Jesus fucking Christ.

334
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:27,031
It's 2019 fellows times when I used to
fly over there we'd have to take tons of

335
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:30,250
wheat to our nuts just,
just to be able to.

336
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,430
And in our road cases just so we could
smoke over there because they had dirt,

337
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:34,180
weed,
you know,

338
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,230
it was horrible.
We'd.

339
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,420
But yeah,
it was a pain in the ass.

340
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,120
It's fucking dangerous bringing that
stuff overseas though.

341
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,550
If you get arrested.
That's.

342
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,210
That's serious.
Yeah.

343
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:45,520
I brought it aside.
Bring it everywhere like that.

344
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,550
And we went to tape a gaff tape.
Jesus man,

345
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,700
like you teared up the first layer of
your nuts off when you go to grab your

346
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,470
weed.

347
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,590
But yeah,
we would do that.

348
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,450
And then it's a commitment though.
Yeah,

349
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:02,660
I actually brought it.
I made the big mistake of not bringing a

350
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,100
bunch,
but I got to Iraq.

351
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,700
We went to Iraq for like right when the
war broke out.

352
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,610
What was it?
Like 2003 or 2004 and we were over there

353
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,510
and,
and a scandalous Esteban oil,

354
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,530
the photographer,
he's over there with us documenting the

355
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:20,840
whole thing and I pull it out because
we're at this airport and ball rain,

356
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,600
but I feel like it's a field and no
one's going to mess with us.

357
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,280
And he's like,
hey bro,

358
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:26,060
look,
look at,

359
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,500
look at the back of your fucking
passport.

360
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,000
Look what it says.
And it says right there,

361
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:32,000
like,
you're basically like they'll kill you

362
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,260
if they,
if they find,

363
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,360
you know.
You brought any drugs and direct or you

364
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:39,890
know where we were a ball rain,
so I did away with everything and I just

365
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:44,891
kind of took up drinking
and I'm not really much of a drinker but

366
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,430
do you still smoke weed?

367
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,480
I don't know.
I have a friend who's like a dear friend

368
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,330
is like a cool,
like young doctor named Dr B in San

369
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,510
Diego and I called them.
He actually removed my,

370
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,260
my tonsils and then like a week later I
found out I had what was called

371
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,930
precancer Barrett's esophagus.
I said,

372
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:05,000
what does this mean Dr [inaudible]
should I just like,

373
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,520
Kinda like,
Kinda like toned down like how much I'm

374
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,360
smoking?
And he's like,

375
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:10,670
no,
this means this is your warning shot.

376
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:15,490
Like pay attention,
stop smoking esophageal cancers.

377
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,320
A rough one to killed Christopher
hitchins.

378
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,120
Really?
Yeah,

379
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,470
that's a,
that's a rough one.

380
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:25,430
That kills a lot of fucking people.
Once you get it and you're gone,

381
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,030
I think it kills.
Like think hitch said like 95 percent of

382
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,850
the people get it now.
Yeah.

383
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,090
So I felt like he,
he's always pretty honest with me and I

384
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,140
just stopped.

385
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,560
Like I love CBD.
That's pretty much what I mess with now.

386
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:44,210
But that's all.
Do you find a lot of people use cbd and

387
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,790
they fund that?
It alleviates anxiety and let them sleep

388
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,110
better.
Do you find that?

389
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,080
Yeah,
as long as I take like triple or

390
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:54,770
quadruple the amount that it says to
take on the bottle because I feel like

391
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,290
what I take,
if I take what the proper dosages,

392
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,820
it doesn't do much,
but I'm one of those people whose minds

393
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:05,390
racing constantly.
I'll get home from the studio at one or

394
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,500
two and I'm just like kind of like
figuring out how long I got to sleep

395
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:13,040
before I get to wake up my kids and go
to school and I just sat there with my

396
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,790
wheels spinning and less.
I use cbd and then that kind of helps.

397
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,910
And then I had.
I have what's called trigeminal

398
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:20,480
neuralgia.

399
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,650
Have you ever heard of that?
No.

400
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,910
Oh,
it's the fucking worst.

401
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:26,780
It's called the suicide disease because
basically all of your nerves in your

402
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:31,700
face or firing all at the same time,
so it almost feels like what you feel

403
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:34,550
when you think you need a root canal or
you have like a tooth that's messed up,

404
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,230
but I got trigeminal Neuralgia and I've
only had four episodes,

405
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,050
but when I do get it,
I use cbd and it.

406
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,930
It's been amazing,
but if you look it up,

407
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,450
a lot of people go actually go to a
dentist,

408
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,470
get a bunch of root canals done that
they don't need or they don't know how

409
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,110
to treat it,
and usually people kill themselves.

410
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,280
Whoa.
Yeah.

411
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,800
It's gnarly.
I didn't really know about it.

412
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,980
I just was home with Dan.
I was like,

413
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,010
what the fuck?
Like my face is burning.

414
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,813
It's miserable

415
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
pain condition that affects the
trigeminal nerve,

416
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,150
which carries a sensation for your face
to your brain.

417
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,930
If you have trigeminal Neuralgia,
even mild stimulation of your face,

418
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:18,650
such as from brushing your teeth or
putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of

419
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:21,230
excruciating pain.
Holy Shit Man.

420
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,810
What is the cause?
What causes that?

421
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,120
All different things they thought like
mine,

422
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:30,620
I maybe got mind from impact,
like from my accident and then maybe

423
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,100
little sparring that I've done has,
has triggered it.

424
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,130
Also dental,
when I get dental work done,

425
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,090
it triggers it so.
But the CBD stops it cbd in it.

426
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:44,290
If it's really bad,
there's um,

427
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,170
this medication called Gabba Pinton.
Uh,

428
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,000
and I feel like that's been a real great
way to kind of mask the pain.

429
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,360
And what once the Gabapentin calms the
nerves kind of duds the nerve.

430
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,940
Twenty four,
48 hours it's gone.

431
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,120
If it's a really bad episode of it's not
so bad,

432
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,910
it just keeps it away.
Well,

433
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,410
they see that a lot of nerve diseases
are inflammation caused.

434
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,780
So sometimes like if you change your
diet,

435
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,550
you can,
you can smooth some of those out,

436
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:16,790
like lower the sugar intake and some of
the other things that might be causing

437
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,010
inflammation.
Did they give you any advice like that

438
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,490
now,
but around the same time I figured out I

439
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,730
was allergic to gluten,
which I really thought was horse shit,

440
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,391
whatever.
I was like,

441
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:25,871
yeah,
right,

442
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:26,471
okay.
Yeah,

443
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:28,400
we need to be gluten free.
Um,

444
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,170
then I tried it and the doctor I had
seen said,

445
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,380
well you really got to try it though.
You got to commit 100 percent,

446
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,500
you got to give it at least like two to
three weeks and see how you feel.

447
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,300
And I did it and it was a game changer.
Like I felt normal.

448
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:46,750
Whereas I'd have a lot of ups and downs
depending on what I was eating and I'm

449
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:49,330
still eating clean at the time I was
still eating Vegan,

450
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:50,071
I'm eating,
you know,

451
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:55,071
whatever.
But a lot of a lot of us can't digest

452
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,550
or,
or kind of our bodies can absorb the

453
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:58,110
gluten.

454
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,943
Yeah,
well it's.

455
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,340
Have you ever had pasta in Europe?
It's very different.

456
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,460
Oh yeah.
So much shit in ours,

457
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:05,294
you know,
so much.

458
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,910
Well it's the Maynard Maynard Keenan
from tool.

459
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:11,760
He explained it to you because you know
he runs in Austria in Arizona.

460
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,750
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

461
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,120
he's,
he's the guy's a fucking wizard man.

462
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,300
He's got his own winery runs in Austria,
but he said that when we subsequently

463
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,350
looked it up after he told me this in
the,

464
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:28,050
uh,
early turn of the century when they were

465
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,680
growing wheat,
they experimented and change the wheat

466
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,450
to make it more dense so that you could
get more yield out of an acre.

467
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,610
And so by doing that they changed what,
how your body processes it and is more

468
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,160
complex gluten's in like a stock of
wheat,

469
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,920
like an old old timey wheat like you
would get like in Italy or France or

470
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,754
something like that.

471
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,320
It's a different wheat.
It looks different.

472
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,430
It's a much more scrawny looking plant.
And so if they had an acre that you

473
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,910
don't get nearly as much wheat.
And so in America we said,

474
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,520
well,
boogers boater and we made it bigger and

475
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,880
better and thicker and your body has a
much harder time processing it.

476
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,240
And that's why people get so much
inflammation and leaky gut and all these

477
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:11,560
different ailments that people get from
bread and pasta in this country.

478
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,200
It's because of this much more complex.
We.

479
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:17,770
But I buy pasta overseas.
I buy this,

480
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,520
I'm God dammit.
I'll say the name of it.

481
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,220
It's I,
I found out about it in Italy that they

482
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,740
sell it in America.
Just for that reason.

483
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,740
Yeah,
because I can eat it and if I want

484
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:31,930
pasta,
it's not that disgusting.

485
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,900
I'm fine.
I love Pasta.

486
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,690
I do too,
but it's just,

487
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,200
it's something that I've found if I eat
a lot of it just fucks me so I have to

488
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,220
make sure that I don't.

489
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,690
Let me find it real quick and I'll pull
up the name of it and I felt like leaky

490
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:47,800
gut,
it was like a hoax.

491
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:49,150
I was like,
what are you talking about?

492
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:52,830
I've never even heard about this,
but I feel like it's legit and they're

493
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,950
spot on about that.
It's called Morelli,

494
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,490
Morelli Spaghetti and it's from Italy
and the type of wheat that they use,

495
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:02,800
it's a very different type of wheat I
get.

496
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,680
It tastes different.
It doesn't blow you up as much.

497
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,580
It's A.
I think somebody explained it to me like

498
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:14,581
what kind of wheat you're looking for,
but what I found is that I've tried the

499
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:19,540
gluten free pasta and it's like,
you know what I like better than gluten

500
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,640
free pasta,
Spaghetti squash,

501
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,720
spaghetti squash with Marinara sauce.
It's fucking delicious.

502
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,810
And I actually sometimes like it better
than pasta,

503
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,270
but um,
they sell that at Erewhon all the time

504
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,620
in the hot part.

505
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,720
It's spaghetti squash is outstanding.
Yeah.

506
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,540
And it's guilt free,
you know,

507
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,374
you can eat it.
You,

508
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,140
you're not thinking you're bloating
yourself up.

509
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,420
Yeah.
But we've ruined pasta.

510
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,770
We ruined ruined pot.
But you know,

511
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,260
it gives you that feeling,
you know,

512
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:48,720
that feeling you get after you eat a lot
of it,

513
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,800
like,
oh,

514
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,160
that's what that is.
Or your body's like,

515
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,410
what the fuck am I doing with this?
Yeah,

516
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:57,220
you're immediately tired loaded.
But if you eat an Italy,

517
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,860
you don't get that feeling and you look
at those people over there,

518
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,810
they're not fat.
It's weird.

519
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,060
It's true.
Yeah.

520
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,460
They're walking around all over the
place and they're eating pasta and

521
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,750
Europe.
Everyone's walking or riding bikes.

522
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:12,490
Yeah.
Americans.

523
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,920
Well,
that's the thing about France to France,

524
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,920
when they're eating those baguettes,
they're,

525
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,070
they're eating it with this very rich
butter that's like a grass fed butter.

526
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:24,540
It's a dark yellow butter,
so it's very high fat content.

527
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:28,820
It's got a lot of essential fatty acids
in it just you're just getting in.

528
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,470
It's a different kind of bread to and
meanwhile they're not fat and they're

529
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:35,320
drinking one and they're not fat.
Like it doesn't make any sense.

530
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,540
Yeah,
agreed.

531
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,300
Standard American Diet.
It's just fucked up,

532
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,630
but I've always wanted to ask you that
about like the drumming because I mean

533
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,250
everything that I do

534
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,880
like everything repetitive,
whether it's boxing or even archery.

535
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,870
A lot of people get injuries and archery
just from repetitive stress from just

536
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,700
pulling the bow back over and over
again.

537
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,230
I'm like,
God Damn Travis,

538
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,240
this,
your whole fucking thing is repetitive.

539
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:02,230
It's like I see you every time I see
like my,

540
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,170
my shoulders hurt,

541
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,970
my elbows hurt.
Now I'm in my first week hurts.

542
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,070
My first week sucks.
Like on tour,

543
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:13,300
really like getting acclimated because
even practice rehearsals are not a show.

544
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,190
It's just a different intensity.
But,

545
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,590
but yeah,
as long as I trained for it,

546
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:22,060
I'm cool,
I kinda like boxing has helped so much

547
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,470
and I don't box because I think I'm a
tough guy or I think I can beat people's

548
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:29,860
asses or whatever.
It's really just for functionality,

549
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,490
like so I can play the drums the way I
want to say.

550
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:34,960
And I started doing it for that reason.
Well No,

551
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:37,810
I started when I knew my son was being
born,

552
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,730
like when my girlfriend at the time was
pregnant,

553
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,070
I woke up that morning,
I ran to the freeway and back like twice

554
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,460
and then I wouldn't found a boxing gym.
I walked into 10 goose.

555
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:52,600
I actually walked into John Prays who
used to be Tyson sparring partner,

556
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,250
um,
and it was like 2005 to 2003.

557
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,380
And then I started boxing.
I just walked into 10 goose and I,

558
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:07,270
I started jump roping and hitting pads
and I don't know,

559
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:12,190
I just had this urge to want to like box
and be better.

560
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,860
That's so interesting.
Like just knowing that you were going to

561
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,690
be a dad,
I just wanted it to be better.

562
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,620
I wanted like,
immediately I just thought to myself I

563
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:24,220
wanted a lifestyle change,
I needed to evolve and I needed to know

564
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:29,221
how to protect this little human I was
bringing into the world and I knew I

565
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:31,180
needed to change my lifestyle because I
was

566
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,560
kind of out of control.
Wow.

567
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,420
It's an amazing thing that happens to
you when you become a father.

568
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,720
It's a weird switch that goes off in
your brain that you can't really

569
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:44,000
describe to people that don't have kids.
Yeah.

570
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,340
And it's even weirder when the switch
doesn't go off.

571
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,050
So like,
you know,

572
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,030
you see people who are horrible father's
parents and I just don't get like,

573
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,010
how didn't,
how did that switch turned on for you?

574
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,460
You know,
how like the ones who don't want to be

575
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,710
around the kids freaked me out the most.
Yeah.

576
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,530
They just don't want to be.
They just want to be away all the time.

577
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:04,490
I just,
I don't get it.

578
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,810
I don't know why.

579
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,100
Yeah,
I couldn't imagine.

580
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,050
But yeah.
And now I love boxing.

581
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,150
Like it's one of my favorite things to
do.

582
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,080
I've been doing Muay Thai a little bit
more because I can kind of save my hands

583
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,510
because it's not good on my hands in any
way,

584
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:18,344
shape,
perform.

585
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,250
How so?
Just the impact over and over.

586
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,800
Do you feel professionally wrapped?
You get umbrella correctly,

587
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,580
but it still bothers my knuckles hurt.
Really?

588
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,590
Yeah.
Are you using big heavy gloves?

589
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,840
Yeah.
What a one ounce gloves are you using?

590
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,400
I think there are 14 ounce.
Maybe she'd switch to like 18 or 20.

591
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,100
Yeah.
Get a thicker padding in the front.

592
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,980
It'll protect your knuckles better and
it even gives you a better workout

593
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:43,200
really because you're pushing more
weight.

594
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,083
A little heavier.

595
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,020
Yeah.
Pushing more weight and you'll have

596
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,370
more,
more impact.

597
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:50,320
But another thing I would say is,
um,

598
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,350
get a bag.
That's a water bag.

599
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,050
Water bags are fantastic.
Have you ever seen those before?

600
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:58,230
I've seen him at the gym.
You get awesome fucking dig into those

601
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:00,570
things and it's,
it's minimal impact,

602
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:02,550
but you still pushing the same amount of
weight,

603
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,410
you know,
through throwing the punches.

604
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:06,300
You can still explode at the same amount
of force,

605
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,790
but you know,
you're sinking into that bag.

606
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:13,791
And so a lot of people with tendinitis
find that that's a way better option is

607
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,663
another.
Um,

608
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,630
uh,
I have two bags out there.

609
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,660
One of them's a fair tax bag and fair
texts makes it's a Moitai bag,

610
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,540
but it's softer.
And the other one's a monster bag.

611
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,380
The monster bags are really hard,
dense,

612
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,120
dense as fuck.
So I like the combination of the two,

613
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,770
but the fair one is good.

614
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,870
If I'm injured,
if like my shoulder's bothering me or

615
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,540
something like that,
I can dig into that bag and it's not

616
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,990
going to have the same jolt is hitting
something solid and hard.

617
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,520
So if you're having problems with your
hands,

618
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,790
that's what I would say.
Another thing you can do is they make

619
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,460
wraps that are gel wraps.
You slide them on your hand,

620
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,770
almost like a glove.
Yeah,

621
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,700
that's what he just told me about as I
trained with.

622
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,200
Yeah,
those are great.

623
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,600
Yeah.
And then that on top of the heavier

624
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,640
glove,
I bet it'll stop all the hand stuff.

625
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,550
Yeah.

626
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,331
I'm going to try that.
Yeah,

627
00:27:58,331 --> 00:28:00,370
he just told me about that.
That'll protect my knuckles a little bit

628
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:04,150
more because I find if I lift weights I
never get big.

629
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:09,151
Like I never look big,
but I feel kind of stiff and just slow.

630
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,030
It's the worst feeling ever and I did it
one time right before tour I had,

631
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,660
I was living in Cheviot hills for a
little while and I was working out at a

632
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,450
gym over there and it was all
bodybuilder guys and I would train with

633
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:23,590
one just to like be pushed and I got
behind my kit and it was the worst

634
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,330
feeling ever.
The worst.

635
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:29,800
I felt like it was in slow motion,
so I figured out like I need to train

636
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,130
how I want to move when I'm actually
playing the drums.

637
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,450
Weightlifting is fine,
but you have to do it lightly.

638
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,810
The thing about weightlifting is people
want to do it to failure all the time.

639
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,140
You know,
do 10 sets of this and five sets of that

640
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:45,000
and go to failure every time.
Come on,

641
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:45,481
push,
push,

642
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:46,314
push,
push.

643
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,420
Don't do that.
You shouldn't do that.

644
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,690
I subscribed to the Pavel Tat Salini
method.

645
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,690
He's a famous Russian Kettlebell
instructor and his philosophy is that

646
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,500
you should do more sets but less
repetition.

647
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,830
So like say if you could do a weight and
you could lift it 10 times,

648
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,770
don't lift at 10 times lived at five.
He lifted 10 bucks going on my voice.

649
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
All this talk about esophageal cancer.
My Voice is rebelling,

650
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,570
but if you say if you could lift
something 10 times,

651
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:23,460
lifted five times and just do more sets
and give yourself a lot of time in

652
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,650
between sets because if you're training
for strength,

653
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,210
you can do certain things like
kettlebells and specific where it's

654
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,650
strength but it's also endurance.

655
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,990
But really if you just want to do
strength,

656
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,020
the best way to do it is to do a short
set of a few repetitions and then do

657
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:44,740
multiple versions of that.
Like take a long time off like five,

658
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,780
10 minutes and then do another five
reps,

659
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,763
five,
10 minutes,

660
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,940
do another five reps and then do it
again in a couple of days and then do it

661
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:54,700
again instead of like once a week where
you just blow your body out and then

662
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:55,840
you're like,
ah.

663
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,550
That feeling where you can barely move.
That's terrible.

664
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,630
It's not a smart way because you don't
recover as well.

665
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,770
Yeah.
And you ended up getting hurt or having

666
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:05,180
to take a day off.
You know,

667
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:08,210
what I started doing was with this one
trainer named Don,

668
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,520
we figured out kind of like a metronome
workout.

669
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,160
So you're actually like a tempo workout
where you're training to a tempo so you

670
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:17,720
have to do high reps,
like you know,

671
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:20,690
you'll stay to a minute and maybe the
tempo is like,

672
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,510
you know what I mean?
So whatever.

673
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:27,800
Even if it's quick and you're not doing
everything like exactly technique wise,

674
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:30,460
really slow and you know,
it's,

675
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,930
it's kind of like making sure you stay
up with the tempo,

676
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:37,250
which I feel like really helped me with
staying quick and fast with drums and

677
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:38,450
more endurance,
you know?

678
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,490
Yeah.
That makes sense.

679
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,690
Like his drumming a young man's game.
I mean,

680
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,000
is it like athletics where as you get
older,

681
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,050
drummer slowdown?

682
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,570
I don't know.
I haven't.

683
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,850
I played just as wild as I did back in
the day.

684
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:51,684
And how old,
you know,

685
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,520
43.
You look great.

686
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,990
Thank you.
Don't look 43.

687
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,120
Yeah.
Max Weinberg told me one time he was,

688
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,930
he watched me play and he was like at a
show or blink played and he's like,

689
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:02,310
I don't know how much longer you can
play.

690
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:05,460
Like that real hard dude.
He's like,

691
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,310
you're going to need back surgery.
You play like you rabies.

692
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,760
Just smashing the fucking drums.
So knock on wood,

693
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:15,540
nothing has changed and I've just a play
exactly how I always have,

694
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,830
you know.
Um,

695
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,800
I don't even want to think about a day
where I have to play any different.

696
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,090
Sure.
It'll come.

697
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,250
But do you get massages?
Yes.

698
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,740
That'll help.
Yeah.

699
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,330
Massages,
epson salt baths.

700
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,550
That's where the tank comes in.
Play,

701
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:31,990
man.
That thing looks amazing.

702
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,120
The tank is all epsom salts.
Look at you dude.

703
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,500
You're fucking crazy
when you watch that.

704
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,600
I watch you play.
And I would just go,

705
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:45,280
how the fuck is this guy?
Maintain this pace because everybody

706
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:46,540
drums differently.
You know?

707
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,100
I mean,
it's really interesting to watch

708
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:51,730
people's different.
Especially my friend bill burr really

709
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:53,800
got into drumming and uh,
you know,

710
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:55,870
he's,
he's really into it and I like watching

711
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:58,000
them play and it's,
it's interesting to see someone take

712
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,940
something up and get better and take
lessons and learn it.

713
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:05,941
But the thing that really strikes me is
how many repetitions are involved.

714
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,150
Like as you're doing this,
like the,

715
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,220
the amount of times you're hitting these
drums is fucking insanity.

716
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,770
You got to pace yourself.
If it's a two hour set,

717
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,120
I know like,
oh,

718
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:19,070
this is a verse of the song.
I can kind of.

719
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,200
This is not a big,
big part,

720
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,310
you know,
you can kind of show,

721
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,900
but it's like around,
you know,

722
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,420
if you're doing around,
look up at the clock and you realize,

723
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,010
Oh wow,
I still have two minutes left,

724
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,830
we'll pace yourself and you know what I
mean?

725
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,450
Yeah.
That's kind of how I approached shows,

726
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,090
but.
But the goal is to train so much before

727
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:38,480
you even get on tour that you're not
even having to think about that.

728
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,640
You're just playing the show exactly how
you want to play.

729
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,950
It's almost,
I imagine it's like that with fighting

730
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,990
where you envision what you want to do
in your head and you're in the shape and

731
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:50,210
you know the technique to execute.

732
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,970
You don't have to think about our like,
oh,

733
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,940
I can't do that.
I'm not.

734
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,300
I didn't practice that enough.
I'd like to be able to just do whatever

735
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm feeling and not be like,
Oh shit,

736
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:03,530
I don't know how to do that or I'm going
to get tired if I do that.

737
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:05,300
I don't want that to happen.
You know?

738
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,990
So that's the goal.
It's just being able to execute what you

739
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,840
have.
The idea in your head won't musicians

740
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,630
have to have discipline because you have
to practice.

741
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,820
It's one of the things that makes you
guys so unique in the entertainment

742
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,900
world.
It's like,

743
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,090
I mean,
I guess maybe actress have to practice

744
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,460
standup comedians.
We only practice in front of an

745
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:29,470
audience,
but you guys have to fucking practice.

746
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,120
We don't go through your show before you
go out.

747
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,260
Now I write,
I write and I listened to recordings of

748
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:38,780
old sets,
but I don't like to sit in front of a

749
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:39,290
mirror goal.

750
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,930
Hey folks.
Yeah,

751
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,340
don't do that.
I don't know anybody because it would

752
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:45,920
feel so weird when you go up to do it.
It would feel rehearsed,

753
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:46,910
right?
Yeah.

754
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:49,250
That's the last thing you want.
You got to be in the moment.

755
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,420
Same thing happens with a.
If you practice too much as a band and

756
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:54,410
the ego,
try to play those songs and act like

757
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,360
you're having fun.
That happens.

758
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,100
So I try to practice a lot on my own and
I'm not even practicing those songs.

759
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,680
Just kind of just drill.
You know,

760
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,150
like Sam Kinison used to have a joke
about the beach boys about,

761
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:08,500
uh,
they're,

762
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,320
they're going out there playing a wish.
They could all be California girls

763
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,490
again,
like Jesus fucking Christ.

764
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,620
Whereas like it becomes a job that you
don't want,

765
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:22,010
that you want it to be fresh and
exciting and you want it to be something

766
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:23,750
that you're really in the moment and
really thinking about.

767
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,590
So I make up new shit on the spot too.
That's the best is I just make up new

768
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:32,090
fills or just try to reinvent the songs
to the point where even like Marco

769
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:34,380
looked back at me and be like,
whatever,

770
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,320
like that's the best,
you know,

771
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,090
just kind of freaking it on the fly and
even to the crowd it's like,

772
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:42,380
whoa.
That's cool.

773
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:46,400
You haven't heard that before.
So that's like after two or three months

774
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,840
of being on tour,
you do stuff like that.

775
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,990
Yeah.
When you get off tour,

776
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,550
do you consciously give yourself arrest?
No,

777
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,040
I'm busier at home than I am on tour on
tour.

778
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,820
So lavish man like you have,
you have someone saying,

779
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,800
I mean you do have people kind of
waiting on you hand and foot somewhat,

780
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,970
you know,
like a catering,

781
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,140
you know,
ready if you want to eat or hey you got

782
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:14,080
to go do an interview 30 minutes before
you go onstage,

783
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,460
a cars outside waiting for you after the
show,

784
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:17,480
taking you to the hotel.

785
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,900
So that doesn't happen at home and at
home I do so many other things besides

786
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:25,820
playing the band.
Like I produced a bunch of rap artists.

787
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,100
Um,
I have crossroads,

788
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,620
I've clothing companies,
I have three kids.

789
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,070
It's way busier at home.
Tourists,

790
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,700
tourists.
A vacation.

791
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,530
That's interesting.
Yeah,

792
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,890
for me.
Wow.

793
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,450
Because I don't know how to say no
either.

794
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,580
Mind you,
I have a lot of things I love that I

795
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:43,290
love doing so I can't complain and be
like,

796
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,510
Oh I hate going to the steer.
I hate doing this.

797
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:49,740
I love it all.
I just kind of love it all so much that

798
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,690
I have trouble saying no sometimes.

799
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,290
So when you,
you're,

800
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,220
you said you're managing or you're
producing rap artists?

801
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,420
Yeah.
How many?

802
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,160
I'm like,
I'm in the,

803
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,460
I'm in the studio right now with this
group called suicide boys who are

804
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,920
awesome.
They're from New Orleans and we have a

805
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,980
eap coming out that's called a live fast
die whenever and we just finished over

806
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:13,180
the weekend,
so,

807
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:14,800
or yesterday.
So it's,

808
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,170
you know,
you go in there at noon and you leave

809
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:20,980
there at four in the morning every day
until you're finished because they're

810
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:23,380
only in town for a little while.
So yeah,

811
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,850
it takes a little bit.
Um,

812
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,700
and then like I worked on xxx
temptations album,

813
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,980
uh,
before he passed away,

814
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,470
uh,
I work with like smoke per,

815
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,580
I'm Vic Mensa,
a bunch of different artists.

816
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,720
Do you like sap because it's a different
genre,

817
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,780
helps you mix it up a little bit.
You're just a big rap fan is why

818
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,010
obviously you're wearing an ice cube.

819
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,901
Sure.
Yeah.

820
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:47,440
I grew up,
I actually listened to rap music before.

821
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:52,441
This isn't any kind of music at all,
like beastie boys and run DMC and public

822
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:56,270
enemy in the far side and Krs one.
That's what I grew up on.

823
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,190
And then I discovered I loved metal too.
I'd love to slayer and king diamond and

824
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:05,690
then then I discovered a band called
minor threat and the descendants and

825
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,690
black flag and bad brains and I just
liked it all.

826
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:12,080
And then my dad listened to jazz music
and country rebel music,

827
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:15,130
so I was born in,
raised on like Johnny Cash and buckles

828
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:20,290
and everything so and I kinda learned to
love it all and I had people around me

829
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:24,050
when I was young when I was first
learning how to read music that just

830
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:27,600
kept embedding in my head like you got
to listen to everything catches me,

831
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,190
can just learn one thing.
So I was actually taught how to play

832
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:35,780
traditional jazz when I was really young
and then I taught myself how to play

833
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:38,060
everything else.
That's fucking cool.

834
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,850
Yeah.
But that's always loved everything.

835
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,470
That's nice.

836
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,810
You have an appreciation for all those
different genres too.

837
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,660
Yeah.
It'd be like if all you did was UFC

838
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:47,620
commentating,
you'd be like,

839
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,340
I'm going to go crazy.
Like this must be so much fun for you

840
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:53,290
and all of your other endeavors.
Like same thing,

841
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:56,020
like if I was only making,
you know,

842
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,320
punk rock records or pop punk records or
whatever it was,

843
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,660
I think I would go insane and it's been
like that for,

844
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,730
for years,
you know?

845
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,380
Yeah.
I think different people.

846
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,200
I think some people,
if they're just doing like baseball

847
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:10,420
commentary or something like that,
they're fucking happy as shit.

848
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,310
They love it.
They just want to do that.

849
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,300
But there's some people like you or
maybe like me that they need different

850
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:17,290
things.
Yeah,

851
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,160
I will go crazy.

852
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,370
I love like studio life is awesome.
Like I did a Hans Zimmer thing and the

853
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:26,210
other week and then the next day I'm in
with a band called nothing.

854
00:38:26,211 --> 00:38:28,100
Nowhere doing something completely
different.

855
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:32,450
This week I'm doing a little peep and
xxx remix it's,

856
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,150
it has to be like that for me are I get
really bored.

857
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,340
I just don't feel creative,
so kind of like,

858
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,090
I don't know.
That's cool though.

859
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:41,200
I like that.
How does that work?

860
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,320
Like you get a phone call or someone
texts you,

861
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,050
hey travis,
we need you to come in here and light

862
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:48,320
this motherfucker on fire and you get in
there and

863
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,890
yeah,
it's been like that,

864
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,480
you know,
or like,

865
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,180
you know,
some projects manifested to like there's

866
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:55,380
this band called the fever three,
three,

867
00:38:55,381 --> 00:39:00,381
three that I produce and write with and
they just got nominated for a grammy

868
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:03,900
like throughout,
for a grammy for best rock performance

869
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,900
and that was something I just envisioned
with the singer of that band,

870
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:11,901
Jason and we started literally a year
ago and they're nominated for a grammy.

871
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,940
Wow.
So like stuff like that,

872
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:18,180
like kind of being an architecture
without building buildings,

873
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,660
being architecture and music or whatever
it is.

874
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:25,860
Whatever it is you're passionate about.
That excites me is building sounds like

875
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:26,640
there's nothing

876
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,560
and working with different genres to has
got to be exciting too because you can

877
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:32,170
mix it up and yeah.
Wow.

878
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,450
Now when you're like,
what,

879
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:35,740
when,
how do use,

880
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,870
how like schedule your time in terms of
like how much time you're going to spend

881
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:43,630
on your own studio work.
How much time are you going to spend on

882
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,880
other people's stuff?
Do you just play it by ear?

883
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,820
It seems like with the guy like you,
you must get so many requests and you

884
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:52,690
said you have a hard time saying no,
I would imagine it's fucking

885
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:53,524
overwhelming.

886
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,140
Yeah.
Well my kids come first before

887
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,580
everything.
Anything,

888
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,310
you know,
and then I get a lot of opportunities.

889
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:04,180
Like my son Landon is a big rap fan.
Like he loves her.

890
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,200
He was raised on rap music,
like he grew up touring with me and

891
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:12,201
little lane when I told a little lane
and he loves being in the studio so

892
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:16,120
he'll come with me to the studio so I
can Kinda like double dip work at the

893
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:19,990
same time as he's in be making music in
my studio b,

894
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,730
which is really,
really awesome.

895
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:23,710
And then same with Alabama.
She's,

896
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,630
I'm lucky they're both musicians because
Alabama and,

897
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,980
and both loved music.
So they like going on tour with me.

898
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,870
They like me.
Yeah.

899
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:34,000
Or,
or I probably wouldn't be working so

900
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,170
much dads.

901
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,170
Cool.
Yeah.

902
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,480
What the fuck is it like going on tour
with Little Wayne?

903
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,650
It was so awesome.
I came up with a rap,

904
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,880
a rap project where I produced.
I've made all the beats and I just got

905
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:48,520
all my favorite rappers,
everyone from like Rizza from the Wu

906
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,550
Tang clan to little wayne,
a game,

907
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,380
swizz beats.
Um,

908
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,341
it was,
it was crazy.

909
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:59,140
I think I had 30 guests on there and
Wayne asked me to go out on tour with

910
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:00,670
him.
So me and mix master Mike from the

911
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,640
beasties were like the opening act on
that tour.

912
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,150
And Drake was out there.
Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross.

913
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,860
Wow.
Fun.

914
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,780
So I loaded up the bus with everyone.
I brought yellow.

915
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:15,400
We'll foul.
I brought j rock a bought Paul Wall.

916
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
I brought the cool kids and we'd just
gotten a bus when we went on tour.

917
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,960
Jesus.
Yeah.

918
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,000
How long are those shows?
All those people.

919
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,360
How long has that show?
That's like a wall with all the acts.

920
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,020
At least four hours.
That's a long time.

921
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,790
But it's so fucking shows

922
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,970
like,
good Lord,

923
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:34,070
that audience must be beaten a coma.
Oh

924
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,020
yeah.
But then the headliners on who they are

925
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,300
really there to see.
But that,

926
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,120
that was a big accomplishment,
just being able to play in that genre of

927
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:47,050
music because I listened to it as a kid.
There's never really been a home for

928
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,190
live drummer in a wrap scenario right
now.

929
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,210
So from the beginning,
I think,

930
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:57,050
I don't even know what year it was when
puff call me when I had just joined

931
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:57,681
blinking.
He's like,

932
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,660
y'all want you to be in this video?
I was like,

933
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:00,530
what?
Like,

934
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,990
you know what I mean?
Because I've pretty much was.

935
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,971
I was just like,
wow,

936
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:04,671
I'm,
I'm in,

937
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,820
what are the biggest bands in the world?
I'm so stoked.

938
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:11,000
I couldn't ask for anything more.
And I always want to go.

939
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,570
I always wanted to get something.
That tour was so fun.

940
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,390
But yeah,
once puff asked me to be in a video is

941
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:21,080
kind of like a,
it just snowballed from there.

942
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,940
You just got into that world.
Yeah.

943
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,790
And I,
I had no idea why he wanted me,

944
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,050
you know,
but I was just like,

945
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:28,460
wow,
this is so cool.

946
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:32,090
Because I grew up on Biggie,
like I loved all that genre of music,

947
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,430
but I was okay with just staying in my
lane as well,

948
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,820
but when I got accepted with open arms
and I was invited to do like bet awards

949
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:43,970
with Tbi or Tiger Wayne and it was just
insane,

950
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:44,880
you know,
playing the grammy's.

951
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,510
The funny thing is I've never played.
The grammy's will blink,

952
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,710
but I played the grammys with black pit
bull drake.

953
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,090
Eminem.
Like,

954
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,010
it's so weird.
It's so weird to me.

955
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:58,820
I just feel it's a trip.
The opportunities I've had outside of

956
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:02,810
rock music has been such blessings to
you when you say all those things and

957
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:05,120
you know that you did all these things
is it almost seems like you're living in

958
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:05,810
a dream.

959
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,190
Yeah,
I feel like smacking myself.

960
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,410
It doesn't feel real when people go
like,

961
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,700
Oh,
who would you like to collaborate with?

962
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,460
I feel like I'm so spoiled and I've been
so blessed to play with all these

963
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,650
musicians.
I love that.

964
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,420
I just say nobody,
you know,

965
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:21,770
whatever comes.
I'm happy with.

966
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,960
Wow.
Yeah.

967
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,310
Well that's cool though.
That's great,

968
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,930
man.
That's means you're fulfilled,

969
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,940
you know,
you're,

970
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,680
you're,
you're doing what you want to do.

971
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:32,150
Like you're ready.
Totally.

972
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,680
Whoever.
Let's do it.

973
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,700
Yeah.
If you wanted to make a record,

974
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,411
John,
be there.

975
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:37,550
You know what I mean?
That's what I'm saying.

976
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,620
Well,
lucky for you,

977
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:42,050
I'm totally talentless in the music
department,

978
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:44,360
so it's not going to happen.
But you're such a talent man.

979
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:47,600
I love like when you and Dominic Cruz
are commentating together,

980
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,120
doesn't get any better.
Yeah.

981
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,630
I love dom.
He's awesome man.

982
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,730
He beat the shit out of me a couple
times.

983
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,120
Why did you let him?
Because he,

984
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,560
you know,
we,

985
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,630
we used to sponsor him a little bit like
famous,

986
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,540
like know he used to walk out and famous
stuff like when UFC wasn't,

987
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,470
they didn't have reebok gear.
Um,

988
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,300
and he would come down and train because
I would train with this one guy josh

989
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:10,960
over here in Woodland Hills and he said,
travel,

990
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:12,390
I'm going to be in town.
I'm going to come train with you.

991
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:12,891
And I was like,
okay,

992
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:15,620
cool.
Little did I know it'd be dom tossing me

993
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:18,680
around and like,
oh my gosh,

994
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:20,420
man.
It was so difficult,

995
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,270
but you roll with them.
Well now it'd be.

996
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:24,560
He'd be like,
try to sleep me.

997
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,540
I try to knock me out,
Jay,

998
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:30,380
so I'm giving my all and just using his
defense and you know,

999
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:31,980
when you,
when you actually swinging

1000
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,830
in the air and you're not landing it
actually more tiresome new when you're

1001
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,380
hitting somebody.
So I'm swinging in the air,

1002
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,860
he's like on the side of me all of a
sudden like,

1003
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:42,720
you know,
he's so quick like footwork and then I'm

1004
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:46,370
wrestled to the ground and it's just a
wrap every time and he's so,

1005
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,410
so talented.
So yes,

1006
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,470
I love that guy.
Yeah.

1007
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,350
He just has the most ridiculous
footwork.

1008
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,950
His footwork is so unique to him,
to everything he does.

1009
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:57,840
He's got like this weird herky jerky
little.

1010
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,010
Yeah,
he does.

1011
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:01,830
He's probably one of the most unique mma
fighters ever.

1012
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,100
I feel like a lot of people have kind of
borrowed from his style for sure.

1013
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,290
Yeah,
for sure.

1014
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,700
Not to say they didn't make it their
own,

1015
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:10,670
but I feel like dom was the first one
you saw,

1016
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,160
you know,
kind of move.

1017
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,290
Unquestionably.
Yeah.

1018
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,080
And that's because of his intelligence,
because he doesn't like getting hit.

1019
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,071
He's like,
okay,

1020
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:18,840
I gotta figure out a way to not get hit
so much.

1021
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,340
Like what's the best way to knock it
hit.

1022
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:24,180
And it just just came up with.
It's very unorthodox way of moving.

1023
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,600
He's a real encyclopedia of information
when you start talking to them about

1024
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,520
fighting.
Like he's a really enjoyed doing

1025
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,730
commentary with him because he's so
insightful.

1026
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,570
He's so good at pointing out little
areas where he thinks people are making

1027
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:39,990
mistakes or how to capitalize on certain
things that people are doing.

1028
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,850
Yeah.
I've watched fights with him before and

1029
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:43,120
he's.
And he,

1030
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,360
he gives a different insight than what
I'm seeing.

1031
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,360
Yeah,
yeah,

1032
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,040
yeah.
No,

1033
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,290
he's great.
Especially when it comes to wrestling

1034
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,320
clinch work and you know,
and even like weird striking techniques.

1035
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:58,290
I mean he's just,
he's so good at befuddling people that

1036
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:02,370
he fights with with movement and
information like he's given them looks

1037
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:02,910
and,
and they're,

1038
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,800
they're trying to set up,
you know,

1039
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,200
they're standing there trying to set up
and they don't know what the fuck he's

1040
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:07,470
doing.

1041
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,600
Then they have to reset.
And they try and again,

1042
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,080
then he's given them a different look
and standing over here and then he's in

1043
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:14,880
front of with his hands down and he's
not.

1044
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:16,360
And Yeah.
Yeah.

1045
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,020
That's a trip.
He's great.

1046
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,820
Just fucked up his shoulder again man.
I know man.

1047
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,860
I think he,
he trained so much.

1048
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,970
I feel like he just,
you know,

1049
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,770
he's a snap session.
Yeah,

1050
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:27,600
he's a savage.
I mean he,

1051
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,280
he got back from knee surgery and he
went so hard that he gave himself

1052
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,700
plantar fasciitis,
say fucked up the bottom of his feet

1053
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:39,300
from running and sprinting and doing all
kinds of crazy shit to get in shape.

1054
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,960
And you know,
he got over that and I mean he's had so

1055
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:44,730
many different surgeries.
Nice.

1056
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:45,930
Are miserable.
Have you had that?

1057
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,190
No,
I've never had planner.

1058
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,290
Oh Man.
I had it on a tour where I would,

1059
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:50,623
I,
I'd get these.

1060
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,670
I get these weird kind of things where I
have to do a certain thing before I go

1061
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:56,220
on stage.
So one of the things I did on a tour

1062
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:57,250
that was,
I don't know,

1063
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:00,690
it was about a four month tour,
is run four to five miles before the

1064
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:04,050
show and by the,
by the middle of that tour I had

1065
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:06,450
actually given myself a stress fracture
in my foot.

1066
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,630
It was terrible.
Did you run on concrete?

1067
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,500
Not a treadmill.
Really?

1068
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,630
Yeah.
Wow.

1069
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,010
Damn.
Well sometimes.

1070
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,290
Sometimes when,
when there was no treadmill,

1071
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,380
I'd just run out in the street,
but I kind of get like that where I just

1072
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,700
like,
I don't know,

1073
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,670
I get obsessive about stuff and I want
to,

1074
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,100
I want to do it.
I get to kind of throw myself all the

1075
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:28,440
way in.
Like what kind of running shoes do you

1076
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:30,130
run?
Do you run with house

1077
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,060
running?
Like honestly,

1078
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:34,390
on that tour sometimes I'd running vans,
which is probably half of my problem,

1079
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:36,040
but you know,
it'd be so quick like,

1080
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,550
oh I have an hour here to do this.
But yeah,

1081
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,760
that wasn't fun though.
It was painful.

1082
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,020
Yeah.
When you have overused injuries,

1083
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:46,910
those are some of the hardest.
Especially your feet.

1084
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,310
There's some of the hardest to recover
from because you have to walk.

1085
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,720
It's not like if you hurt your elbow,
you could just not use it for a while

1086
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,420
and it will eventually heal up,
but you need to use your feet.

1087
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,100
Yeah.
Planners,

1088
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:58,940
a rough one,
man.

1089
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,380
I know a lot of people that have got
that.

1090
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,750
I've been very lucky.
I came from a martial arts background,

1091
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:07,040
a lot of kicking and stuff like that,
so my feet are pretty strong from

1092
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:10,040
moving,
but I found that a running with minimal

1093
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:12,860
issues on hills that that made him even
stronger.

1094
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,890
Yoga,
Yoga,

1095
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:15,130
stronger.
Like what?

1096
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,560
Those weird kind of a.
What do they call vibram?

1097
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,330
Five finger shoes.
I wear those and where there's another

1098
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,640
company called Vivo barefoot or wear
those.

1099
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,970
I like those a little bit better for
running on the hills because I'm running

1100
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:28,800
on a lot of rocks and shit and the
vibrams they.

1101
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,710
They would be great if everything was
soft dirt,

1102
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,520
but I'm running on weird jagged rocks
and shit and it just.

1103
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,650
It hurts your feet.
You've got to be real careful where you

1104
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,780
place your feet.
Yeah,

1105
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:43,130
but it just forces your feet to work as
they're supposed to as opposed to like a

1106
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:45,990
big cushiony running shoe.
You know,

1107
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,090
like cushiony running shoe feels good.
It feels good to run on it because you

1108
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:52,070
get all this cushion.
It's not so jarring,

1109
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,220
but your body really,
really should run.

1110
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,500
I think personally,
unless you're a runner,

1111
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,450
he should probably run less with a
minimal issue then you should run

1112
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,210
because it's more comfortable to run
with the big fat cushion.

1113
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:09,200
I think you ultimately give yourself
probably more injuries that way.

1114
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,150
Yeah,
but you can get injuries from those

1115
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,050
minimal issues too if you don't pay
close attention.

1116
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:16,490
He tried too hard,
too quick.

1117
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,350
Your foot's not conditioned for it.

1118
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,720
My feet are terrible too,
man.

1119
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,780
I had what was called a lis franc
fracture.

1120
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,010
What have you heard of that?
It's basically your,

1121
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:26,100
your foot breaks in half,
like all your,

1122
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,950
all your tendons,
your ligaments and your bones.

1123
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,060
How the fuck did you do that?
So I was high as a kite and it was in

1124
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:37,290
Australia and I was running to the bus
and I had like two huge bags that were

1125
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:39,150
like,
probably like I probably had 40 pounds

1126
00:49:39,151 --> 00:49:42,810
on my back and I was just trying to get
to the bus to get to the next show or

1127
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:46,050
whatever and it was the stupidest thing
ever,

1128
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:47,250
but it was a little like,
you know,

1129
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:50,640
the little cracks in the sidewalk where
it's up higher and I didn't see and I

1130
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:55,410
fell with all that weight on me and I'm
in the bus and I'm starting to think,

1131
00:49:55,411 --> 00:49:57,270
wow,
this is really bad in my tour managers.

1132
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,580
Like Amen.
Just get the blood flow and try walking

1133
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:03,360
on it and I'm trying to just suck it up
and I'm walking in the airport.

1134
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,580
I'm like,
almost like tearing,

1135
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:08,370
like I'm fucking hurting so bad.
I was like,

1136
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:11,490
man,
I think I need to get an x ray or like

1137
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:12,840
an MRI.
This isn't good.

1138
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,960
So I play like the next two shows with
my other foot.

1139
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,890
I get an x ray.
They said I've broken my foot and half I

1140
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,080
need surgery.
So I,

1141
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:24,300
um,
I think I ended up doing a couple of

1142
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:26,250
weeks of the tour,
which I shouldn't have,

1143
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:29,450
I should have gone and that surgery,
but I played it with my other foot and

1144
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:32,330
then I got home,
I did the surgery and I was like six

1145
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:36,710
months on crutches and just recovering.
It was terrible.

1146
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:40,960
Six months on crutches and then I feel
like I wasn't feeling that great because

1147
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,880
I was taking so many painkillers and
everything.

1148
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:47,180
It was slowing down the process,
which I don't know if you've heard of,

1149
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:50,840
but that it really,
like my bones became super brittle from

1150
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:53,090
pink from painkillers,
painkillers,

1151
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,280
norcos.
Yeah.

1152
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

1153
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,490
But I would imagine the pain must've
been fucking excruciating.

1154
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,560
Snapping your foot and half.
Oh,

1155
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,690
it was so painful when it first
happened.

1156
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,410
It's something else for pain medication
after you got off of that stuff and just

1157
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:10,520
smoked weed.
Yeah.

1158
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,570
Yeah.
Is that enough?

1159
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,610
Yeah.
I'm pretty good with pain.

1160
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,140
It doesn't really bug me.
What about edibles?

1161
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,320
Haven't really done it.
You don't fuck with edibles,

1162
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,670
really?
I haven't had anything for 10 years.

1163
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:26,690
Nothing,
nothing.

1164
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,920
Zero,
no alcohol,

1165
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:28,731
no weed?
No,

1166
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,460
nothing.
Damn yeah,

1167
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,660
10 years,
which was a big,

1168
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,210
well after my accident as well,
I was fed,

1169
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,000
you know,
four months in a hospital being fed

1170
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:42,500
morphine every day for four months and
then being on all these bipolar meds and

1171
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:44,960
everything else,
I honestly didn't want to put anything

1172
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:47,510
in my body when I got out.
I didn't even take painkillers when I

1173
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:49,340
got home.
Now.

1174
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:52,060
What kind of bipolar meds they put you
on to it?

1175
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,950
I don't even remember.
I was on like four or five.

1176
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:57,140
Just bipolar and they,
I mean I had like,

1177
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,680
I had so many,
I probably had like 12 medications I got

1178
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:04,370
sent home with and I did it for about a
week or two and then I wouldn't see my

1179
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,120
doctor.

1180
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,230
I had actually overheard one of my
friends talking who was like a brother

1181
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:12,380
to me and I had heard him talking to
someone else and he was like,

1182
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:15,380
Yo,
like travis seems a little different,

1183
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,770
you know,
it seems a little bit slow or something.

1184
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,510
And,
and I had overheard him.

1185
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:23,840
He didn't know I overheard him,
but I was these meds.

1186
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,240
I had been telling my doctor,
I was like,

1187
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,690
I just don't feel like me.
I feel,

1188
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,420
I don't know,
I feel weird and I just don't feel like

1189
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:31,880
myself.
So I just flushed them down the toilet

1190
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:34,070
one day and the next week I came back to
see him and he's like,

1191
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:34,791
how are you doing?
I said,

1192
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,220
good.
I'm off all those meds you told me I'd

1193
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:39,860
be on for the rest of my life.
They're like,

1194
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,900
oh dude,
from what you've been through,

1195
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:44,330
like you,
it's okay to be on something like that.

1196
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,260
And I was like,
yeah,

1197
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,810
I'm doing fine though.
Like I don't need those,

1198
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:48,644
you know,
these,

1199
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,110
I wanted to put you on a.
because of the plane crash.

1200
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:51,800
Yeah.
They like,

1201
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,760
don't shame yourself by,
by giving yourself a hard time that you

1202
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:57,830
have to take these pills.
And I said,

1203
00:52:57,831 --> 00:52:58,730
well,
you know,

1204
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:00,230
I honestly,
I don't feel like they're doing what

1205
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:03,590
they're supposed to for me and actually
having a negative effect on me,

1206
00:53:03,591 --> 00:53:05,210
so I don't,
I really don't want to take them.

1207
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:07,460
You know?
They also told me I'd never run again,

1208
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:09,080
I'd never do this.
I never do that again.

1209
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:11,330
So I think I just got to the point where
I was like,

1210
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,680
let me see how many things I can prove
otherwise that they've told me,

1211
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,930
you know,
once I stopped taking the pills,

1212
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,470
Jesus.
So they put you on bipolar medication

1213
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:23,420
because of a traumatic crash?
Yeah,

1214
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,620
that seems odd to me.
I mean,

1215
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,430
I'm not a doctor

1216
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,390
obviously,
but.

1217
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,770
Well I was kinda crazy,
you know,

1218
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:33,310
I was suicidal when I was in the
hospital.

1219
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,980
Um,
I was on so many drugs I couldn't even,

1220
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,990
I didn't even know my friends had passed
away.

1221
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,440
I didn't even know the two pilots had
passed away.

1222
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,800
I didn't remember anything.
I kept thinking like everyone was in the

1223
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:47,170
hospital,
including the two pilots,

1224
00:53:47,171 --> 00:53:51,370
including my two best friends and am.
I thought everyone was just in different

1225
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:54,070
rooms until about two weeks before I
left.

1226
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,940
And then I went crazy.
Then it was like they had a 50 1:50

1227
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:01,180
cases on their hands,
you know,

1228
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:03,100
I wasn't,
I wasn't in a good place.

1229
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,870
So yeah.
Then I did,

1230
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:09,610
I did a lot of like posttraumatic like
therapy when I was in the hospital to

1231
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:11,620
kind of like calm things down.
Um,

1232
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:15,340
once I got through all my surgeries and
then yeah,

1233
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,140
I mean over time it was,
it was cool,

1234
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:20,290
but it was never cool but I started to
feel better,

1235
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,130
you know?
Um,

1236
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,150
but yeah,
I think it was cause I was so crazy at

1237
00:54:25,151 --> 00:54:26,610
the time,
but that's,

1238
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,473
it's interesting

1239
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:32,580
that I would think that bipolar
medication would be something that you

1240
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:37,581
would give someone who has like a,
a condition that just is sort of pre

1241
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,410
predisposed to it.
Yeah.

1242
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:44,220
I don't know anything about bipolar,
but I would think that that's something

1243
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:47,790
that you just have to have a mental
condition.

1244
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,730
I wouldn't think that it would be
something that they would give you to

1245
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:52,620
overcome a traumatic incident.

1246
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,880
Yeah,
I think they were afraid I was going to

1247
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:57,460
be,
I had like a mental condition after

1248
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,690
everything happened.
You know,

1249
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,590
they think like maybe because you're an
artist that you're probably a little

1250
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:02,424
crazy anyway.

1251
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,770
Possibly.
Yeah.

1252
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,290
I mean I think.
But I was a mess too.

1253
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:06,741
Like,
you know,

1254
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:09,650
like I had done,
I'd smoke so much weed,

1255
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,320
you know,
every day and I'd taken so many pills

1256
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:17,321
and I would self medicate quite a bit
that I woke up probably out of 11 and my

1257
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:22,511
30 surgeries I had in the burn center,
I woke up swinging on doctors so I would

1258
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:27,080
wake up and I would just,
I'd be opened up and I would just go

1259
00:55:27,081 --> 00:55:28,880
crazy.
Jesus Christ.

1260
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:30,580
So trying to get off the table.
Yeah,

1261
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:33,320
we would just try to get off the table.
I don't even think I really knew what

1262
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:35,660
was going on.
I just wasn't,

1263
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:38,720
they couldn't give me enough medication
and knocked me out because I had been

1264
00:55:38,721 --> 00:55:42,680
self medicating for so long and abusing
meds for so long.

1265
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,530
Wow.
So you would get up from anesthesia,

1266
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,720
you would just wake up in the middle of
anesthesia.

1267
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,640
So yeah,
that was crying.

1268
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,890
That was a problem.
Um,

1269
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,680
how did you clean up?
Um,

1270
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,600
I think after,
I think the last time I swung under a

1271
00:56:01,601 --> 00:56:02,810
doctor,
they were kinda like,

1272
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,190
you,
you're not going to,

1273
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,860
you can't be here no more.
And then I was like,

1274
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,010
wow,
well I need x amount of more surgeries

1275
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,280
and I,
I really was just in fighting demons,

1276
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:16,040
you know,
I just figured out like my two best

1277
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:19,730
friends had passed away and the pilots
had passed away and I was just like in

1278
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:21,800
an ugly place.
And um,

1279
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,400
you know,
my,

1280
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,830
my kids couldn't visit me because 65
percent of my body was burnt so I

1281
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:29,410
couldn't be around people.
So I was just in it man.

1282
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:30,244
And then,
um,

1283
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,720
and then I just,
I don't know,

1284
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:36,721
I turned a corner and then I was like a
team player and I don't think I was on

1285
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:40,060
as many meds.
Most of my surgeries were over and just

1286
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,460
learning how to walk again.
Um,

1287
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,100
being able to take a shower by myself
again,

1288
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,030
all that stuff,
man.

1289
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,300
I think that was just,
those are the good points that helped me

1290
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:51,550
turn the corner and I dunno,
I just had more strength,

1291
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:52,240
you know?

1292
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,310
Yeah.
So wow.

1293
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,790
So you just just turned a corner in your
mind and just sort of accepted it and.

1294
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,450
Yeah.
Same with drugs,

1295
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:04,620
like I didn't ever do rehab or anything.
I think it was mainly my kids and just a

1296
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,890
second life,
a second chance at life was enough for

1297
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:08,724
me.
I was like,

1298
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,590
I don't,
I never want to do any of that stuff

1299
00:57:10,591 --> 00:57:11,424
again,
you know?

1300
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:14,070
That's cool.
So once you get a certain amount of

1301
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:19,071
distance between you and those days,
does it seem like it wasn't even real?

1302
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,060
That's wasn't you doing those things?

1303
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,130
Yeah.
You look back and you're just like,

1304
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,050
fuck,
like I still talk to those doctors to

1305
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:28,300
this day like Dr Grossman.
He's,

1306
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,100
he's,
he's so awesome.

1307
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:32,380
And he basically saved my life,
you know?

1308
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,780
Um,
but I still talked to him.

1309
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:38,530
He lives out here in the valley and he
has Grossman burn center and I go with

1310
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:43,030
at Christmas and see burn burn victims
that are over there in the,

1311
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,070
in the burn center and help out any way
I can be.

1312
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:45,904
Yeah,
he's great.

1313
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,330
Yeah,
it's really cool.

1314
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,123
Yeah.
Um,

1315
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:53,480
many of my friends that I know that I
had real bad drug problems and then now

1316
00:57:53,481 --> 00:57:56,030
are off drugs.
They look back and go,

1317
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,270
what the fuck was I doing?
Like how did I do?

1318
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,660
How was that me?
Yeah.

1319
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,970
It's interesting how that happens in
your life,

1320
00:58:02,971 --> 00:58:05,640
who you have these new chapters in your
life and in.

1321
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,560
Sometimes it could just be something
that happened like two weeks ago and

1322
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,230
you're like,
who the fuck was that guy two weeks ago?

1323
00:58:12,231 --> 00:58:13,960
I'm not even here anymore.
You know,

1324
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:18,961
like you get sometimes people make these
abrupt turns and their life and then

1325
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:19,630
they go,
yeah,

1326
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,960
I'm never going back.
And you go,

1327
00:58:20,961 --> 00:58:23,240
well we'll see.
And then you look 10 years later,

1328
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:23,631
like,
wow,

1329
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:25,130
you were right.
You never went back.

1330
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,023
Yeah.

1331
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,250
Yeah.
And I think like,

1332
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,010
I still have.
Have you ever heard of what's called

1333
00:58:29,011 --> 00:58:30,600
like user dreams?
No.

1334
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,640
Where like,
I think I fucked up and I was smoking

1335
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:35,250
weed again and I wake up and I'm like,
oh my God,

1336
00:58:35,251 --> 00:58:36,730
how am I going to stop?
Because I love,

1337
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,790
I love smoking so much.
You know,

1338
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,700
or whatever your vice was,
you know,

1339
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:45,180
if it was like whatever was just like,
you wake up and you think you're doing

1340
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:48,090
it again.
And then you realize nom I'm all good.

1341
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,400
I used to have dreams like that where I
had to go back to high school.

1342
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,710
Really?
I used to have dreams for years.

1343
00:58:52,711 --> 00:58:53,970
Man,
you hate high school

1344
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,900
too.
I don't think anyone likes it unless

1345
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,670
you're like,
you know,

1346
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:01,820
soon to be a professor.
Fucking doctors.

1347
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,780
Well I just had no idea what I wanted to
do for a living and I was just like,

1348
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,490
being trapped in a classroom constantly
was excruciating.

1349
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,270
I must have had.
I mean I probably do have some crazy

1350
00:59:14,271 --> 00:59:15,620
form of add.
I don't know.

1351
00:59:15,621 --> 00:59:17,630
I've never been diagnosed that been to a
shrink.

1352
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,300
But if I did I,
I mean I'm sure they'd probably try to

1353
00:59:20,301 --> 00:59:24,320
put me on if I tried to tell them what's
going on in my head all the time,

1354
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:25,011
they'd be like,
Jesus,

1355
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:25,760
sit down,
hold on.

1356
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,610
I take these,
take these.

1357
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:31,280
Whatever you do is bad.
But when I was in high school,

1358
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:35,270
I fucking hated it and I barely got by.
And then when I got out of high school,

1359
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:39,030
I would have these dreams where I'd wake
up in the middle of the night and I

1360
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,330
didn't have enough credits to graduate
and have to go back.

1361
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,520
Then it was sitting there in my bed
before I woke up trying to decide

1362
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:51,170
whether or not I was just going to
fucking drop out and not graduate from

1363
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:54,020
high school,
not have a high school diploma or go

1364
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:56,990
back and do another fucking year of
hell.

1365
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,930
And it was my,
my guts would turn and I'd wake up and

1366
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:00,920
Oh my God,
I graduated.

1367
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:01,720
I graduated.

1368
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

1369
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,140
It was the worst.
I was the same way,

1370
01:00:05,141 --> 01:00:05,974
man.
I just like,

1371
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,370
just barely got by high school.
Did you go to school out here?

1372
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,550
Well I grew up in like Fontana,
Riverside,

1373
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,910
yet Kentucky.
Shout out to double dose.

1374
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:20,911
More tie out there.
So people like to fight in Fontana.

1375
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:26,500
People like to fight everywhere
now they're fighting every or play

1376
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:28,540
football in Fontana.
Yeah.

1377
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,240
Yep.
But uh,

1378
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,320
yeah,
it was the same way.

1379
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:35,680
Just just skated by high school.
And then I remember I didn't even want

1380
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:37,240
to walk.
I fucking hated it so much.

1381
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,960
I actually rode my skateboard with my
friends that were like much older than

1382
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:42,790
me.
Daddy go skateboarding with every day

1383
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,120
and we were skateboarding by the high
school is everyone walked and got their

1384
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:47,800
diploma.
Just.

1385
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,280
Did you get your diploma?
That?

1386
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,170
Yeah,
they sent it to me,

1387
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:52,150
but I didn't want to fucking be there.

1388
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,320
Go to my graduation.
I'm like,

1389
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,440
I'm gone.
This is.

1390
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,070
Once I got through it,
I'm like,

1391
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:01,250
you don't have me anymore.
I can be free.

1392
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:04,010
It took me a while to figure out what
the fuck to do next.

1393
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:05,770
Yeah.
I would sit there and they will be like,

1394
01:01:05,771 --> 01:01:07,690
so what do you want to do?
Like counselors?

1395
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:09,520
And I was like,
I just want to play drums in a band

1396
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:11,020
really?
And they'd be like,

1397
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:16,060
well that's not an option.
Are you going to talk to me?

1398
01:01:16,061 --> 01:01:18,130
Like I was like,
just insane.

1399
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,263
Isn't that crazy?

1400
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,610
There's so many bands and there's so
many drummers.

1401
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,900
Why is that not an option?

1402
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,620
Yeah.
Why is that not an option?

1403
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,300
It'd be better if they just said,
well,

1404
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,580
you know,
like I don't know if they motivated you

1405
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,910
to actually do what you're passionate
about instead of just being,

1406
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:33,170
well,
well that's not gonna happen,

1407
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:34,130
so what do you want to do?

1408
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:39,460
Fucking people that probably wanted to
be drummers and just never got a push

1409
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:40,420
and never,
never,

1410
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,680
never made it through.
But then there's the other argument that

1411
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:46,770
if you really want it,
you'll find a.

1412
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,710
yeah,
you got to do it.

1413
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:50,360
I mean,
my dad used to tell me the same thing.

1414
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:53,840
He'd be like,
you gotta have a plan B,

1415
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,320
and I'd be like,
well,

1416
01:01:57,321 --> 01:01:59,270
if I have a plan B,
I'm not going to try that hard.

1417
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,450
Yeah.
I started thinking in my head and then

1418
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,430
that's when I just said,
Nah,

1419
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:05,540
fuck that.
I'm,

1420
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:08,500
it's only this,
no matter if I'm rich or poor,

1421
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,790
whatever,
whatever the circumstances,

1422
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:14,000
this is what I'm doing.
Like I don't give a fuck what the

1423
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:14,834
outcome is.

1424
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:19,020
I think that's the right mindset.
I don't think people get by that.

1425
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,800
When I was just starting to do standup,
there was a lot of guys who had full

1426
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:25,930
time jobs and they got degrees and you
know,

1427
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,950
they would work their full time job and
then they would just do standup at a

1428
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:31,050
couple of nights a week.
They never made it.

1429
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:36,150
It was the obsessed guys and women,
the people that were just like,

1430
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,100
I,
this is my fucking life.

1431
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,380
This is what I do.
I'm going to do this.

1432
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:43,230
Those are the ones that do it,
that no safety net people and the ones

1433
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:43,980
that made it.

1434
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,840
Yeah,
I mean it's going to fucking happen.

1435
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,780
You just have to.
You have to stick with it.

1436
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,040
I feel like the people who really stick
with it and give it like 110 percent,

1437
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,070
your time will come.
It will,

1438
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,420
however big or small it is,
something will happen,

1439
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:58,170
you know?

1440
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,220
Yeah,
yeah.

1441
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:02,790
If you figure it out and keep improving
and keep learning and learn from your

1442
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:06,990
mistakes and learn from your setbacks
and keep trying to push and get better

1443
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:10,950
and improve.
If you do all those things is as

1444
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,640
hopeless and helpless as it seems.
If you continue to improve,

1445
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,610
you've got to get to a better place,
you got to get better and one day you'll

1446
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:20,550
be undeniable.
And if you don't,

1447
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,490
and if you just fall back on that safety
net,

1448
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,300
you're always gonna wonder.
You're always going to look at Travis

1449
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,690
Barker going fucking hand on the drums
going,

1450
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,810
shit.
That could have been me,

1451
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:31,891
dude.
I almost did it.

1452
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,510
I actually,
at one point in my pops,

1453
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,560
my pops is awesome.
But um,

1454
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:40,190
he's a Vietnam vet and wrote him a
Harley his whole life and he just

1455
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,220
basically said to me,
he's like,

1456
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,620
Yo,
you gotta eat,

1457
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,390
they gotta start paying rent at the
house because,

1458
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:47,610
you know,
you're not in high school anymore or a

1459
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:52,350
and get like a 60 hour a week job,
like a real job or you need to go,

1460
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,120
you know,
go fucking play drums but you're not

1461
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:56,490
going to do it here in my garage.
So I was like,

1462
01:03:56,491 --> 01:03:58,110
okay.
And it was probably the best thing that

1463
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:59,130
was ever said to me,
you know,

1464
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:04,131
as harsh as it was or whatever.
And then I had actually caved in and I

1465
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:05,910
just told my,
my friend Nola was like,

1466
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,370
you know what,
I think I'm just gonna I'm going to get

1467
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:11,070
this fucking job because I just somehow
got a job that made,

1468
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,110
you know,
in a warehouse it was like target

1469
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:16,230
warehouse making pretty good money
compared to what I was making at the

1470
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,064
time.

1471
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,700
And um,
and he hit me the next day and he's

1472
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,300
like,
I think you're making a big mistake.

1473
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:24,840
I think you're very fucking talented and
I think you'll regret this and you can

1474
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:27,600
get this bullshit job any anytime down
the line,

1475
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,150
come live with me,
you know,

1476
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,780
stay at my house.
You could sleep on the floor,

1477
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:34,410
the couch and let's play in this fucking
band and do it.

1478
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,910
And I did it,
you know,

1479
01:04:35,911 --> 01:04:39,900
I was like a trash man in Laguna beach.
Lived in like this studio apartment with

1480
01:04:39,901 --> 01:04:43,770
a couple of the guys and just fucking
took off.

1481
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:46,350
Like I had to like,
I mean it was like humility too,

1482
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:48,990
you know,
that was like playing bar after bar and

1483
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,590
you know,
you know,

1484
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,590
but I was eating,
I was eating,

1485
01:04:52,591 --> 01:04:53,341
I was,
you know,

1486
01:04:53,341 --> 01:04:55,560
I was skateboarding every day and I was
living at the beach,

1487
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:59,010
playing in a band with my friend.
So for me I had already made it.

1488
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,460
Those are the best stories,
the best stories.

1489
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,250
And I think back even to this day,
I go to Laguna sometimes I'm like,

1490
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,650
wow,
that was kind of one of the best moments

1491
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:11,280
of my life besides my children being
born like poor,

1492
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:15,900
no money but like happy as fuck,
like can't even think of another time.

1493
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,850
I was that happy you.
Yeah.

1494
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,480
Cool.

1495
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,330
Well the only pressure is the pressure
of trying to succeed.

1496
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:26,590
There's not the pressure of already
succeeding and the overwhelming pressure

1497
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:28,510
that you must experience now.
Yeah.

1498
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,630
Those are great stories,
man.

1499
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:34,740
The stories of like where you didn't
know if it was going to work.

1500
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:35,880
Yeah.
You figured it out.

1501
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:36,430
I'm clue

1502
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,730
those stories right now.
Some kids are listening to those stories

1503
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:42,070
right now.
Listening to you say this and they're

1504
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,030
like,
fuck man,

1505
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:44,910
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to go for it.

1506
01:05:44,911 --> 01:05:47,800
Like who knows how many rock stars
you're making right now just saying

1507
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:48,170
this.

1508
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,460
Yeah.
Because a lot of them are teeter

1509
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:50,130
tottering.
Yeah.

1510
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,120
I'm not going to do it.
Am I not going to do it even though,

1511
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,590
I mean I was at the time now and you
just have to,

1512
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,640
you know,
don't worry about being cool or being

1513
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,910
fucking rich or having money.
Just be passionate about what you're

1514
01:06:01,911 --> 01:06:04,700
passionate about and fucking dedicated
100 percent,

1515
01:06:04,701 --> 01:06:05,140
you know?

1516
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:06,280
Yeah.
There's those moments,

1517
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:08,140
man,
when you first starting out anything

1518
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:11,340
where it's not sure,
it's not a,

1519
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,760
it's not a definite thing.
You were in this weird limbo space like,

1520
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:17,440
man,
am I going to be a loser my whole life?

1521
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:20,530
Like what's going to happen to me and
those moments,

1522
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:22,900
man,
when you look back and you realize you

1523
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:25,240
could acquit,
but you kept going,

1524
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:27,220
you figured it out,
you sucked it up.

1525
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:30,170
You worked your way through it,
you improved.

1526
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,970
He kept moving.
Yep.

1527
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,580
Yeah.
That's life,

1528
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:35,280
man.
That's what defines you,

1529
01:06:35,281 --> 01:06:36,011
ma'am.
Yeah,

1530
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:38,710
it really does.
I just love those fucking stories.

1531
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:42,070
I can never get enough of them and the
dirty,

1532
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:45,380
grimy and then finally make it story
fast.

1533
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,740
Did you run out of space to Tattoo?
I'm going to tell you right now,

1534
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,750
I'm actually getting tattoos on top of
the tattoos.

1535
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:57,751
That's outrageous.
I just got this lj for xxx.

1536
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,040
I'm going to get working on some new
ones.

1537
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,290
Have decided just to go back in

1538
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,520
it Kinda like remix in them at this
point,

1539
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,780
you know,
like getting tattoos,

1540
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,640
tattoos.
Have you ever gotten lasered?

1541
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,290
Yeah,
once I had like a new wife and I

1542
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:17,430
divorced my ex wife and she wasn't
really stoked on the ex wife's name on

1543
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:17,951
me.
Yeah,

1544
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,940
this sounds like a problem.
So I lasered it because it was right on

1545
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:25,770
my neck and she always had to see it,
but that's the only time I've ever done

1546
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:26,160
it.
I,

1547
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,360
there's nothing on me.
I really want to get rid of her.

1548
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:29,194
I'm like,
oh that.

1549
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,320
It's all a story.
To me.

1550
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,180
It all tells a story.
It's like a moment in time and I got it

1551
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:36,660
for a reason,
but I was trying to be cool and you know

1552
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:38,340
what I mean?
Trying to be respectful and make her

1553
01:07:38,341 --> 01:07:39,690
happy at the time.
That makes sense.

1554
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,950
Yeah.
I mean it was amazing.

1555
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:43,860
She hung in there all the way to being
married with another chick's name on

1556
01:07:43,861 --> 01:07:44,790
your neck.
Yeah,

1557
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,380
that's true woman.
True.

1558
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,180
But in that regard.
Yeah.

1559
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,770
Yeah.
But yeah,

1560
01:07:52,771 --> 01:07:53,910
I love tattoos,
man.

1561
01:07:53,911 --> 01:07:55,620
They're addicting because I love them
too.

1562
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:58,020
Once I figured out they didn't hurt at
the age of 15,

1563
01:07:58,021 --> 01:07:59,660
it was on.
I didn't know.

1564
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,760
Like people tell you,
they're like,

1565
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,030
oh,
it's so painful.

1566
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:04,890
And then you get when you're like,
wait a minute,

1567
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,690
it's not so bad.
This is like,

1568
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,300
it's Kinda like a,
a slight burn.

1569
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:10,243
Yeah.
It's like

1570
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,610
kind of therapeutic to bed.
I fell asleep.

1571
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:18,800
I was getting same.
Same when I did my back piece,

1572
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:21,680
I fell asleep and I had two artists
working on me at the same time.

1573
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,350
Oh Wow.
Just because I fucking hate wasting

1574
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,540
time.
So they.

1575
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:27,440
Yeah,
they did my back together.

1576
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,860
They did my head together to either
heads.

1577
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,230
Impressive.
Let me see the head.

1578
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,730
Let me see what that looks like.
When did you get that done?

1579
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,120
I did my head like,
I don't know,

1580
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:39,920
six years ago.
Wow.

1581
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,793
Yeah.
Yeah.

1582
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,770
I started.
I had like a piece on the side of my

1583
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,650
that Mr. Cartoon did back back in the
day.

1584
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,030
I love that guys work.
Yeah.

1585
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,860
Cartoon is such,
he's amazing legend.

1586
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:49,900
He's got great shit.
He's,

1587
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:51,740
he is a legend.
He's a legend.

1588
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,200
Even outside of tattooing,
like lowrider culture.

1589
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,390
He's,
he's one of the illest.

1590
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:57,440
But um,
yeah,

1591
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,960
he,
he did that and then that kind of set it

1592
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:01,490
off.
I always had like praying hands on the

1593
01:09:01,491 --> 01:09:05,060
side of my head and then I shaved my
head and I've never grown my hair out

1594
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:06,860
since because I'm like,
fuck it.

1595
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,840
It's permanent haircut.
No,

1596
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:14,570
but what is up there?
It's hard to see what the shine I have

1597
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,090
like Virgin Mary,
right?

1598
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,000
Oh Wow.
Um,

1599
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,300
I think I have like a rose.
You think

1600
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:26,950
a lot of tattoos on my head.
I have like a transplant gas masks on

1601
01:09:27,441 --> 01:09:28,910
the back of my head.
I have one life,

1602
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:31,180
one chance.
Um,

1603
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,140
yeah.
And then like some writing.

1604
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,080
Wow.
Now when you got burned,

1605
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:39,140
did it affect your tattoos?
Did you have to tattoo over it?

1606
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:40,730
Yeah.
So I lost.

1607
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,210
I lost all of my tattoos on my legs.
Wow.

1608
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:45,440
Yes.
I lost,

1609
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,990
I lost my first tattoo ever,
which was a dag nasty.

1610
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:52,760
Tattoos is hardcore band punk band that
I loved forever in a bones tattoo,

1611
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,200
which was my nickname growing up.
Um,

1612
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:58,620
but I lost everything on my legs.
So then they do like,

1613
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,030
they do what's called that grafting.
So they.

1614
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,680
Oh.
And I lost some tattoos from my back so

1615
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:06,500
they take,
it's like a cheese grater and they grade

1616
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:11,530
all of your skin off your back and my
thighs and then they staple it to you

1617
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:15,290
with pig cadaver and they will wait for,
uh,

1618
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,880
for you to start healing.

1619
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,130
Um,
so yeah.

1620
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,360
So I lost a lot of tattoos and then I,
I did like on my thighs.

1621
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:24,230
You can't really see.
I did,

1622
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:27,650
I did memorials for,
for though Chris Chain,

1623
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,900
a Dj am who,
uh,

1624
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:34,730
who all passed away in the accident.
So I put them on my legs over the graph

1625
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,350
so you can't really see it.
But yeah,

1626
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:40,190
I mean I got out pretty well man.
Like I mean you can kind of see it on my

1627
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:40,881
hand,
my hand.

1628
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:45,710
You can see it's discolored and stuff.
But for having almost 70 percent of my

1629
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,690
body burnt,
like you can't really tell.

1630
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,160
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1631
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,060
Really tell it all because you're so
tattooed up that up.

1632
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:56,150
The pain of healing burns is supposed to
be excruciating.

1633
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,210
It's the fucking worst thing ever.
Well for,

1634
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:00,800
for me to.
I mean,

1635
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,840
I don't think you guys ever think about
being burnt.

1636
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:05,030
I know I didn't.
I would just be like,

1637
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,570
I don't know,
I just never think about fire until

1638
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:10,700
you're on fire.
And then you're like,

1639
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:12,170
oh shit.
And then.

1640
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:15,240
And then
the,

1641
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:18,150
you know,
the treatments afterwards to like do

1642
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:19,170
everything,
you know,

1643
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:22,290
like,
like they would put me in this big pan

1644
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:26,010
that was literally about as big as this
table with different people all around

1645
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:28,860
you.
And they would scrape all my brain with

1646
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:31,290
a metal brush to get rid of all the
infection because I had,

1647
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:35,400
I basically when I,
when I jumped through the emergency

1648
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:36,840
exit,
when I open the emergency exit,

1649
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:40,080
before the plane blew up,
I was in such a hurry to get out of the

1650
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,530
plane and exit the plane.
I jumped right into the jet,

1651
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:48,270
which is full of fuel.
So my whole body lit up,

1652
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,860
you know,
so I had jet fuel just in my whole body,

1653
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:55,500
like I burped jet fuel for almost three
months.

1654
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:59,760
So they had like that was the main thing
to get rid of the infection is they

1655
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:03,780
scrub you with a metal brush to get rid
of all of it and all of the dead skin.

1656
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:08,310
And then.
And then I did about 30 surgeries to

1657
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,560
repair everything,
like skin graft surgeries.

1658
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,290
They saved my foot because at one point
they were going to amputate my right

1659
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,790
foot.
Yeah.

1660
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:18,160
It was wild.
I would picture strategy burnt that they

1661
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,420
have to amputate my right foot.
Almost didn't make it.

1662
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,960
Was it because of the way it was,
was it was necrosis or like what was

1663
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:26,550
going on that they were going to
amputate it?

1664
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:30,870
I think because that was the thing that
was most soaked was,

1665
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,320
was my shoes and socks.
I jumped into the jets,

1666
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,270
you know,
and I had done,

1667
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,840
I had exited the plane,
I started running,

1668
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:44,400
I started like ripping off my clothes,
just that's what my instinct told me.

1669
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:47,940
Just get rid of everything.
But little did I know I would still be

1670
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:50,610
on fire because the jet fuel was soaked
in it.

1671
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:56,300
So I'm actually running towards a
highway highways right on the side of me

1672
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,310
and I just hear some guy yelled,
like,

1673
01:12:58,311 --> 01:12:59,640
stop,
drop and roll.

1674
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,510
And it just like I heard it out of all
this chaos of every sirens and

1675
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:05,720
everything and I stopped dropping
enrolled.

1676
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,030
And the only thing that was still on
fire was my feet in,

1677
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:10,400
am came in,
um,

1678
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:13,440
patted them out.
So I think they were on fire the longest

1679
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:15,450
two.
So still like my,

1680
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:19,560
I think my right foot is probably like
over 50 percent of it's a graft.

1681
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,700
Wow.
Yeah,

1682
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:22,580
it's wild,
but um,

1683
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:23,791
yeah,
that was like,

1684
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:25,140
I never,
like I said,

1685
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:27,510
I never even thought about.
It's not something you think about until

1686
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:30,180
it happens to you,
but being burnt is like,

1687
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:31,080
uh,
it's,

1688
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,370
it's horrific.

1689
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,920
You know.
Were you affected by the recent fires

1690
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:38,190
out here?
It came about a couple hundred yards

1691
01:13:38,191 --> 01:13:39,810
from one of my houses.
Oh Wow.

1692
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,720
But I was in Vegas.
I was actually playing a show.

1693
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,920
We left that morning and then we got
phone calls saying you got to evacuate,

1694
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:48,600
but we were already gone with you.
Thank God.

1695
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:49,500
Yeah.
Had the kids,

1696
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,510
my dogs with me.
Um,

1697
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,940
my,
my housekeeper was at the house so she

1698
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:56,810
was able to get the rest of our dogs out
and um,

1699
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:57,803
yeah,
we were,

1700
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,150
as long as I had them there with me and
I was like,

1701
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:02,340
everything else is replaceable.
It's whatever.

1702
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:03,511
Um,
but yeah,

1703
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:04,650
that was sketchy.
I mean,

1704
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:08,620
you saw,
obviously you live very close to it.

1705
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,080
Yeah,
we got evacuated.

1706
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:12,100
Um,
while we ourselves,

1707
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,710
before they had a mandatory at two in
the morning,

1708
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:18,130
I came back from the comedy store.
My wife and I were looking out the

1709
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:20,950
window in the flames are coming over the
hill and I said,

1710
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:22,930
no one's going to save us.
Here I go,

1711
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,120
we have to figure out what the fuck
we're going to do.

1712
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:26,860
And she's like,
I think we should go.

1713
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,240
And I said,
alright,

1714
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,820
I think you're right.
And we just got a hotel room and we just

1715
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:35,140
bailed and I just grabbed.
I literally grabbed my laptop and I

1716
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:36,390
think that's it.
Some,

1717
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,580
some clothes and then the kids were a
little freaked out.

1718
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:40,081
But I said,
look,

1719
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:41,860
we'll just look.
We're here.

1720
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,590
We're all right.
Like we could buy more shit.

1721
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,900
Like the dog's fine.
We're fine.

1722
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,640
That's how I was too.
I was like,

1723
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,140
let it burn.
Yeah.

1724
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,330
You know,
I don't want it to burn obviously,

1725
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:54,670
but rather than you being hurt,
like,

1726
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:55,720
fuck man,
this is,

1727
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:59,280
this is.
It's an inconvenience when when you're,

1728
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,740
when you lose your house,
it's a horrific tragedy when you lose

1729
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:03,850
your life,
you know,

1730
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:05,740
we're not,
we're going to get the fuck outta here.

1731
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,800
And so they were freaked out.
But within a day or two,

1732
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,860
I mean we stayed in a hotel for a week,
but within a day or two they were.

1733
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:13,420
They were cool.
We were laughing about it.

1734
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,070
Same.
We did the same thing that came,

1735
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,460
came home but did not really home at a
hotel for a week.

1736
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,280
But yeah,
you felt kind of helpless,

1737
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:22,580
like you couldn't do much,
you know,

1738
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,990
it's not like I could sit there and and
put out the fire myself,

1739
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:27,070
you know,
they wouldn't even let us in our

1740
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:27,580
community.

1741
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:28,590
Yeah.
Same here.

1742
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,840
Crazy for people that weren't around
here.

1743
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:36,700
They don't know how crazy it was.
But the sky was filled with smoke

1744
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:40,600
everywhere you looked with smoke.
I mean all of La was filled with smoke.

1745
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:41,770
It was,
I've never,

1746
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,540
we were.
We stayed in Beverly Hills at the

1747
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:47,530
Waldorf and you look out the balcony
window and it's just fucking gray.

1748
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,860
Just smoke everywhere.
I've never seen fires like that before.

1749
01:15:50,861 --> 01:15:51,694
Never in my life

1750
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:53,660
neither.
And I always see we're on high alert.

1751
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:57,260
Do you not see it?
Like my kids are at school over in

1752
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:01,820
Malibu or really close to there and I
always see high alert but nothing's ever

1753
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:02,880
really happened.
You know,

1754
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:05,840
there's been small fires,
but that was horrific.

1755
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:08,450
That was just,
it looked like Hiroshima in our

1756
01:16:08,451 --> 01:16:09,730
neighborhood.
Like you know,

1757
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:14,330
airplanes flying really low,
dropping fire retardant and it was,

1758
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,230
it was crazy.

1759
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:19,190
Bill burr flies helicopters.
He's got his helicopter license and we

1760
01:16:19,191 --> 01:16:24,191
took a flight around Malibu around point
dume and you go over there and you see

1761
01:16:24,471 --> 01:16:28,040
these massive estates just burnt to the
ground.

1762
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:33,070
These gorgeous houses with the perfect
view on the bluff overlooking the ocean.

1763
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,960
Gone huge lots,
you know,

1764
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:40,580
$20,000,000 houses gone just burnt to
the ground and there's so many of them.

1765
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:44,180
And then like one house standing there,
one house out of just random.

1766
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,860
That's how it was in our neighborhood to
house caught fire,

1767
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:48,630
but nothing near it.
Caught fire hose.

1768
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:49,480
It's weird.

1769
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,201
Yeah.
Some shit.

1770
01:16:50,201 --> 01:16:53,680
We'll fly through the air land on
someone's house and if you have like

1771
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:57,610
pine needles or something on your roof
or a flammable roof,

1772
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,880
just catches,
catches on fire.

1773
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:03,090
Was it a campfire that started taking
part?

1774
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,790
It's called Campfire.
Oh,

1775
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:08,050
I don't think it was a campfire.
That was the name of the fire.

1776
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,660
I don't think.
I don't.

1777
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:12,170
I don't know what the fuck the cause of
that fire was.

1778
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:13,280
Jamie CV.
You find that out.

1779
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:16,250
Do you know what it is?
They've been trying to blame or blame

1780
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:18,980
has been put on like different utility
companies and whatnot.

1781
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:21,020
And they're,
they're not taking the blame or they can

1782
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:23,810
prove that it wasn't them and wow,
it's been being passed around.

1783
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:26,600
I don't know that anybody knows yet what
I've been looking at.

1784
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:29,420
You know,
it's fucking crazy though,

1785
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:30,201
man.
When,

1786
01:17:30,201 --> 01:17:31,190
uh,
I was in boulder,

1787
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:35,360
there was a giant fire that broke out
that was a fireman accidentally started

1788
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:36,680
a fire.

1789
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,320
Yeah.
He had a fire pit in his backyard and

1790
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:44,580
some fucking embers blew out of his fire
pit and started a giant fire and just

1791
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:50,180
burn massive amounts of wild forest.
It's just gone.

1792
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,450
Damn.
A fireman.

1793
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,850
I imagine he must,
must've felt like shit.

1794
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,920
It mean anybody start.
I mean,

1795
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:02,060
just couldn't fucking imagine if it was
your fault that one of these things get

1796
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:03,410
started.
Oh yeah.

1797
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:04,480
The guilt.
I would.

1798
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,690
I wouldn't be sleeping for weeks.
Decrease territory is northern

1799
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:11,570
California.
Northern California got it way where we

1800
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:13,520
got it bad down here,
worse than I've ever seen.

1801
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:15,590
But they get it way worse in northern
California,

1802
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,160
Northern California.
They lost a shitload of people died on

1803
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,650
the highway.
That's what I see burned to death in

1804
01:18:21,651 --> 01:18:23,420
their cars.
You see those photos?

1805
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:25,580
Yeah.
Fuck man.

1806
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,990
Yeah.
A lot of this is because of,

1807
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:31,910
you mean there's a lot of issues,
right?

1808
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:34,270
There's the dry,
um,

1809
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:36,110
you know,
the fact that dry climate,

1810
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:39,230
the fact that climate change is
happening,

1811
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:43,910
but also the fact that there is no small
fires like although those dead trees are

1812
01:18:43,911 --> 01:18:48,560
supposed to get knocked down by small
fires like controlled fires and those,

1813
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:51,950
that doesn't really happen anymore.
We don't want small fires that can

1814
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:56,330
possibly get out of hand.
And so you have these forests that are

1815
01:18:56,331 --> 01:19:01,010
oftentimes filled with dead trees right
next to live trees and a lot of dead

1816
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:02,150
trees all over the place.

1817
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:03,600
Wow.
So they're supposed to do,

1818
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:05,970
that's like maintenance burning like the
small gallons

1819
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:09,130
before.
There's May mean some people advocate

1820
01:19:09,131 --> 01:19:12,190
doing it for maintenance,
but in nature that's like a natural

1821
01:19:12,191 --> 01:19:14,110
thing.
Like the lightning would hit light

1822
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:18,310
something shit on fire and the live
trees would probably survive and a lot

1823
01:19:18,311 --> 01:19:21,640
of the dead ones would burn to the
ground and we'd actually regenerate the

1824
01:19:21,641 --> 01:19:22,474
forest.
Yeah.

1825
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:25,210
Yeah.
I mean the crazy thing is like you look

1826
01:19:25,211 --> 01:19:28,060
how fucking lush and green it looks out
here now,

1827
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,840
but you would never imagine that just a
few months ago this was a raging

1828
01:19:31,841 --> 01:19:35,710
inferno.
It actually is good for the ground,

1829
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:37,060
you know,
and all that

1830
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:39,350
still smells like fire too right now.
Prices.

1831
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,710
Yeah.
Every time it rains it's starting to get

1832
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:44,350
a little bit better.
But does it freak you out when you see

1833
01:19:44,351 --> 01:19:46,930
fire now because of your accident?
Yeah,

1834
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:49,480
it took a little while for us to have
pyro again.

1835
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:52,900
Oh you never.
It was like we just got back together

1836
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:58,390
and like this really,
really like killer,

1837
01:19:58,391 --> 01:20:01,540
like photographer had this idea to do
this photo shoot and they wanted us

1838
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:06,480
holding like the watchman call it the
thing like the flares accent.

1839
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,810
He got me to hold it for a second and I
was like,

1840
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:12,780
oh bro,
I can't do this wrong photo shoot.

1841
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:14,670
Like I'm sorry,
you know,

1842
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:17,670
I know you have this vision,
but that's an insensitive vision.

1843
01:20:17,671 --> 01:20:19,010
Yeah.
And I.

1844
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,090
Yeah,
yeah,

1845
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:22,740
right.
That would have been a little bit more

1846
01:20:22,741 --> 01:20:26,720
fitting but.
And then and now we do pyro stuff on,

1847
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,930
on stage and production.

1848
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:31,410
It doesn't really bug me but I'm very
cautious around the house.

1849
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,490
Like with my daughter,
she has like a straight iron plugged in

1850
01:20:35,491 --> 01:20:38,430
or for my son,
whatever lights a candle.

1851
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:40,800
Like I'm so crazy about it,
which

1852
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:45,710
are a little weird.
So I have to ask you this,

1853
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,910
Tom.
Talk about Ufos all the time.

1854
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,440
Well you know,
he's not in the band.

1855
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:50,560
No,
I know,

1856
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:53,040
but I always do that.
He always did.

1857
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:57,990
We used to get loaded and just look out
the bus window and I used to do it with

1858
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:58,910
him as like,
I don't know,

1859
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,120
it's kind of a bonding experience.
It's like if you wanted to show me bow

1860
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:04,850
and arrows,
whatever were on tour together,

1861
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,130
I sit there and like,
you know,

1862
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,710
check it out.
So with Tom,

1863
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:10,590
that was his thing,
like fucking let's get high and look for

1864
01:21:10,591 --> 01:21:13,830
Ufo.
So he would just sit there and like

1865
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:17,220
stare out the bus window,
look at Ufo or like he would even go as

1866
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:20,550
far as when we're on tour,
like let's go and fucking look for

1867
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:21,384
bigfoot.

1868
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,470
But whatever it was,
you know,

1869
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,280
and he would assemble a crew and they
would go do it.

1870
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,530
Oh my God,
I never got me on one of those trips

1871
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:30,600
because that was just to fairy tale for
me.

1872
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:32,130
But um,
but I,

1873
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:33,060
you know,
I'd do that.

1874
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:36,690
And he was always,
it's really not something he just got

1875
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:41,691
into from the day I fucking met him when
he was obsessed with Ufo and aliens and

1876
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:45,720
was always very passionate about it to
the point where like I didn't know

1877
01:21:45,721 --> 01:21:49,830
enough to,
to have any kind of,

1878
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:53,030
I guess like opinion on it.
I was just very open and,

1879
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,050
and you know,
just took it all in,

1880
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,260
but nothing has changed.
He's still,

1881
01:21:58,410 --> 01:21:59,370
the other day I talked to him,
he's like,

1882
01:21:59,371 --> 01:22:00,870
I'm on the way to the fucking White
House Bro.

1883
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,580
And I don't ask any questions I like,
as you should be,

1884
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:06,443
you know,
whatever.

1885
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:11,550
Let's fucking go get a great response.
Yeah.

1886
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,450
Good luck with that.

1887
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,540
Wow,
that's crazy.

1888
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,770
Yeah,
he was a trip man.

1889
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,920
Having a conversation with him was very
strange because I'm,

1890
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:23,970
a part of me was like skype putting me
on like what is happening is dead ass

1891
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:27,450
just seemed like it.
And we would look at these videos that

1892
01:22:27,451 --> 01:22:31,020
were so clearly horseshit and he would
be like amazing.

1893
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:31,830
Right?
And they're like,

1894
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:34,920
what?
Like you think that that's an actual

1895
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:37,170
Ufo?
Like that is the fakest fucking video.

1896
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:39,630
I've ever seen in my life,
but he didn't see that at all,

1897
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:43,680
but yeah,
in his mind he was seeing a real alien

1898
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:44,514
spaceship.

1899
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,830
Even on tour.
I'd be like,

1900
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:47,880
walk in my room and be like,
what are you doing?

1901
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:48,260
I'm like,
oh,

1902
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,760
check this thing out.
I just made up whatever,

1903
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:50,594
playing drums.
He'd be like,

1904
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,790
dude,
fucking whatever.

1905
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:55,400
George Bush just did you know,
he needs just coming at me with some

1906
01:22:55,401 --> 01:22:57,470
like politics.
He's been watching CNN or,

1907
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,190
or like he's just,
he's always been obsessed with it,

1908
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:04,820
so he's obsessed with all sorts of like
hidden things,

1909
01:23:04,821 --> 01:23:06,030
so not just Ufo

1910
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,310
but big foot too.

1911
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,410
Conspiracy theories,
politics,

1912
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,690
everything.
Very,

1913
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:15,950
very passionate about all those things.
Conspiracy theories and politics.

1914
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,600
It's interesting how those things

1915
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,180
go together because people are always
wondering like,

1916
01:23:21,181 --> 01:23:24,510
who the fuck is running things?
What's really going on?

1917
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,650
What's happening behind the scenes?
Who's pulling the strings?

1918
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:32,040
What is it all really mean?
You know?

1919
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,070
Ah,
but the UFO thing,

1920
01:23:35,071 --> 01:23:36,060
it's like,
boy,

1921
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,550
boy,
you gotta.

1922
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,440
I mean,
I absolutely believe there could be

1923
01:23:40,441 --> 01:23:44,580
intelligent life out there,
but I haven't seen a fucking single

1924
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:47,310
thing that makes me think that anybody's
got a picture

1925
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:48,750
video.
Yeah.

1926
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,880
I feel like it could,
it could be real.

1927
01:23:50,881 --> 01:23:52,540
I believe,
but I'm not,

1928
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:56,610
I can't fucking.
I'm not dedicating my life to search for

1929
01:23:56,611 --> 01:23:57,460
it,
you know,

1930
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,860
and I give it to a man to like honestly
to walk away from your fucking very

1931
01:24:01,861 --> 01:24:06,861
successful band to go do that shit.
Like I have nothing but respect for his

1932
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:10,590
passion,
but it's like I couldn't do that.

1933
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:11,550
That's insane.
Yeah.

1934
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:14,220
It's like that just,
it really shows like he's,

1935
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,380
you know,
he's very,

1936
01:24:16,381 --> 01:24:18,570
very passionate about it.
It will be saved up some money.

1937
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:19,680
Yeah,
me too.

1938
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,180
You know,
a survivor.

1939
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,410
Survivorman Les Stroud.
Nah,

1940
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,940
he's a,
you ever see that show?

1941
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:28,590
A fucking great show.
He would.

1942
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:33,710
Survivor man would go out into the woods
with a limited amount of things.

1943
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,640
He would say like,
okay,

1944
01:24:34,641 --> 01:24:37,550
I've got this bucket,
I've got a fucking pocket knife and I

1945
01:24:37,551 --> 01:24:41,180
got a ball,
a ball of yarn and I'm going to survive

1946
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:44,870
out here for seven days.
And in and he films the whole thing and

1947
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:48,500
he'd be filming himself like eating
frogs and catching a squirrel and

1948
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:52,570
finding edible plants and just living
out in the forest and oftentimes going

1949
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:56,210
days and days without food.
And then he would have like a point

1950
01:24:56,211 --> 01:24:59,030
where he'd get rescued seven days in,
there would be a spot where they would

1951
01:24:59,031 --> 01:24:59,930
meet him.
Um,

1952
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:05,320
he had an experience when he was in
Alaska a long time ago where he was

1953
01:25:05,421 --> 01:25:10,040
camping and he said he heard footsteps,
like big heavy footsteps.

1954
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,960
And you heard some sound that sounded
like a gorilla,

1955
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:18,800
like something like that.
And then it ran off.

1956
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:22,580
And to this day he's convinced that that
was a big foot.

1957
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:27,970
And so now he has survivor man bigfoot.
And he goes out into the woods and just

1958
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:32,360
looks for evidence of sasquatch.

1959
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:33,660
Well,
he should.

1960
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,650
He needs to.
He needs,

1961
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:35,400
they hit up.
Tom.

1962
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,160
Tom pull up,
he'll go with.

1963
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:39,450
And he would love that.
I'm sure he would.

1964
01:25:39,451 --> 01:25:40,284
Fuck.

1965
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,300
He's trying to get me to go with them.
I'm like,

1966
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:43,510
good luck.
I did.

1967
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,380
I did it one time.
I went hunting for big foot for a

1968
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:50,110
television show I did for Scifi.
I called Joe Rogan questions,

1969
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:53,650
everything we went looking for bigfoot
and the more I talk to these big foot

1970
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:57,010
folks that Maura was convinced,
none of these motherfuckers have ever

1971
01:25:57,011 --> 01:25:59,710
seen big flood.
There was one lady that I talked to,

1972
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:04,520
one lady who just did not seem like a
liar and she was telling me that she saw

1973
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:08,390
something in the woods and it was
standing up and it was tall,

1974
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:09,710
like seven,
eight feet tall,

1975
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,650
and she's like,
why is there a gorilla in the woods?

1976
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,020
And then she's like,
oh my God,

1977
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:16,730
that's pig foot.
And he said,

1978
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:21,500
and it was the Pacific northwest outside
of Washington state or in Washington

1979
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:25,130
state outside of Seattle,
and the woods are so dense up there that

1980
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:27,260
if anything goes 10,
20 feet,

1981
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:28,094
it's gone.

1982
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:31,460
The problem with that is that there's
black bears up there in black bear,

1983
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:34,590
sometimes standing up on two feet.
They do it all the time and if you saw a

1984
01:26:34,591 --> 01:26:37,000
blackfoot,
especially a black bear rather,

1985
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:39,680
especially from a distance,
you would think it was a big gorilla.

1986
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,960
It was standing up on two feet,
which they do do,

1987
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:43,460
especially when they're trying to see
something.

1988
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:47,060
They'll stand up and they'll even walk.
This is a lot of videos of them walking

1989
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,320
on two feet and just never seen it.
That's crazy.

1990
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:55,520
I could see a big 400 percent.
So I think,

1991
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,383
I don't think that lady is

1992
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:57,360
liar.
I just,

1993
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,553
uh,
don't.

1994
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:00,900
She might look,
it might be real.

1995
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:02,220
There might be a few of them left.

1996
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:06,700
There definitely was a thing called
gigantic [inaudible] that lived in Asia

1997
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,180
and the thought is that it came across
the bering land bridge the same time

1998
01:27:10,181 --> 01:27:14,850
that native Americans came across from
Asia and that they came across and

1999
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:19,750
because they lived in Asia and this,
this gigantic Pythius I think lived as

2000
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:24,751
recently I think as 100,000 years ago.
I think the most recent fossils they

2001
01:27:25,691 --> 01:27:28,180
have of it,
which is human beings were alive back

2002
01:27:28,181 --> 01:27:32,530
then.
And this thing was a six or an eight to

2003
01:27:32,531 --> 01:27:36,490
10 foot tall bipedal hominid.
So it was a huge,

2004
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,490
huge apelike creature.
So check this out.

2005
01:27:39,491 --> 01:27:40,240
This is a

2006
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,520
look at this bear.
So the craziest shit ever.

2007
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,430
Bears walking on two legs.
Look at him.

2008
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:49,050
Wow.
Like if you saw that,

2009
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:52,280
like totally like,
oh my God,

2010
01:27:52,281 --> 01:27:55,550
it's a fucking pig foot.
Especially if you believe the hype and

2011
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:57,800
do your search for big foot out there.
Yes.

2012
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,810
Yeah.
Or if you're on shrooms yet,

2013
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:02,300
right?
I mean if you're walking,

2014
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,440
if you're high on mushrooms,
you're like,

2015
01:28:03,441 --> 01:28:05,640
oh my God,
look at that thing.

2016
01:28:05,641 --> 01:28:06,290
He's like,
hey,

2017
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:07,220
how you doing?
Oh,

2018
01:28:07,221 --> 01:28:08,300
he's got to hurt.
Right foot.

2019
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,910
That's what that is.
You see his right foot or something

2020
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:12,950
wrong with his right foot sometimes.
Yeah.

2021
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:16,910
It looks like he's missing his front.
Paws says sometimes bears will fight

2022
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:18,230
with each other.
One barrel.

2023
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:23,150
Bite the bear's foot off.
Or he could have gotten shot or it could

2024
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:25,610
have broke it off on something.
Yeah.

2025
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:27,170
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2026
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,220
He's missing a foot.
So he's.

2027
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:32,210
He's walking around out Taylor gorilla.
But everybody else.

2028
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,790
I was like,
when I'm talking to them,

2029
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,560
they're like living in make believe
world.

2030
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:37,730
Here's another one.
Walking around.

2031
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:39,200
Look at him.
Wow.

2032
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,580
That is weird man.
Those are big ass bears.

2033
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,350
Big Ass bear Hillen.
On two feet,

2034
01:28:45,351 --> 01:28:47,660
I mean they look like fucking people,
man.

2035
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,580
I think that is a big reason why they're
feeding them.

2036
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,490
That is so crazy.
Where is that?

2037
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:00,340
That doesn't seem like America.
South Korea is South Korea.

2038
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:01,920
Wow.
Oh the.

2039
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:05,910
So that's one of those wildlife parks
where the animals are all.

2040
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,770
And you're in a car.
Yeah,

2041
01:29:07,771 --> 01:29:10,590
that's like fake wildlife.
I mean wildlife,

2042
01:29:10,591 --> 01:29:13,440
but not really wild.
Have you ever see that video where the

2043
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:16,320
lady was in China and they were in one
of those parks and she got in a fight

2044
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:16,950
with her boyfriend.

2045
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:19,620
So she got out of the car and she got
killed by a tiger.

2046
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:21,930
No,
she actually,

2047
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:23,670
she didn't get killed.
Her mom got killed.

2048
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,520
She's more fucked up because her mom
came out to rescue her.

2049
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:29,670
She got snatched by the tiger and then
her mom watch this shit.

2050
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,360
This is crazy.
On another video of it,

2051
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:32,460
she's like,
fuck you.

2052
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,560
I'm fucking walk in.
And they're like,

2053
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:35,371
hey listen,
bitch,

2054
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:37,550
get back in the fucking car.
There's tigers out here.

2055
01:29:37,551 --> 01:29:37,981
And she's like,
no,

2056
01:29:37,981 --> 01:29:38,370
no,
no,

2057
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:41,220
fuck you and fuck him and fuck you.
And the tiger.

2058
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:42,730
Just grabs her,
snatches her out.

2059
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:46,410
So the guy runs out and then the mom
runs out and apparently the mom got

2060
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:46,891
killed.
Two.

2061
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:49,290
Here comes the mom.
That lady wound up dying.

2062
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:50,530
Wow.
Yeah.

2063
01:29:50,531 --> 01:29:53,710
And there was a park ranger like shit.
Yeah.

2064
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,400
When you get snatched up by a 600 pound
cat,

2065
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,670
she about that fucking dude in Colorado
today.

2066
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,040
He killed a mountain lion with his bare
hands.

2067
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:06,060
He smothered to death,
jacked him while he was jogging.

2068
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:08,820
He was running on the trails.
The mountain lion grabbed him from

2069
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:10,770
behind.
You getting a struggle with is 80 pound

2070
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:15,771
cat and wound up suffocating it.
I guess fucking bad ass jog or just I

2071
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:21,011
want to know the fuck bar is net.
Fuck you.

2072
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:24,660
Fuck.
It would have to be like Derrick Lewis

2073
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:27,600
or someone you know like.
So I can't picture anyone else being

2074
01:30:27,601 --> 01:30:29,850
able to do that.
Maybe is a Jujitsu guy.

2075
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,580
We see him.
I've seen him when my kids were really

2076
01:30:32,581 --> 01:30:37,440
young in Calabasas where I live,
I saw one like just pacing back and

2077
01:30:37,441 --> 01:30:39,850
forth and my back fence.
Jesus,

2078
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:42,270
they're out here man.
They're out here.

2079
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,250
And then we see coyotes and deer all the
time.

2080
01:30:44,251 --> 01:30:46,650
But mountain lions,
that's next level.

2081
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:47,700
Scary.
Yeah.

2082
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,880
A friend of mine just sent me a message
this morning when I was.

2083
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,910
When I posted that thing on instagram
about that guy that killed it and he

2084
01:30:53,911 --> 01:30:58,911
said he was running on this fire road
and he realized he like,

2085
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:04,460
felt weird and looked over and 20 feet
away from him was a big cat right above

2086
01:31:05,911 --> 01:31:08,370
him on this Ridge,
20 feet.

2087
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,900
So that's basically us to that wall.
Big Cat just look at and he said he

2088
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:17,790
waved his arms to look bigger and think
just walked away like a.

2089
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:23,570
I carry a knife when I run,
I carry a fucking half phase blades has

2090
01:31:24,501 --> 01:31:27,660
got to like a loop.
You could stick your thumb into it so it

2091
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:31,230
stays in your hand and people are like,
why are you running with a knife?

2092
01:31:31,231 --> 01:31:34,860
What the fuck he doing?
Like you don't need it until you do.

2093
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:39,580
And when you do you want to have it.
Didn't someone get attacked by a coyote

2094
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:43,530
and hidden hills?
Like running to the story about that.

2095
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:46,680
But I mean,
I ran in my neighborhood before and it

2096
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:51,780
to coyotes ran right past me and they
usually don't mess with like humans,

2097
01:31:51,781 --> 01:31:54,570
you know.
Well we had a problem with them killing

2098
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:58,410
chickens because chickens in my yard,
I've lost a bunch of chickens to.

2099
01:31:58,411 --> 01:31:59,170
Coyotes were.
They were,

2100
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,250
they were on top of the chicken

2101
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,960
coop,
poem tiles off of it.

2102
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:04,870
They're creepy little fuckers man,
but they're little,

2103
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,400
you know,
these are like 35,

2104
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:08,680
45 pounds.
They're not very big,

2105
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:12,580
but they're creepy and some about their
little wolves and they're looking at you

2106
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:14,560
and they're trying to figure out a way
like what can they eat,

2107
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:16,510
what can't the.
They're out there scraping,

2108
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,910
scraping and grinding.
They're sneaky.

2109
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:19,744
Like

2110
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:22,200
sure.
Like I saw one of my friends,

2111
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:25,670
a dear friend of mine,
lost both of his dogs to coyotes and he

2112
01:32:25,671 --> 01:32:27,620
had,
I think he had like surveillance of it

2113
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:30,080
and one is in the yard and he's playing
dead.

2114
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:33,800
And then his dogs approach what they
think is dead.

2115
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:39,250
And then basically like his home,
he comes out of nowhere and attacks and

2116
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,990
a both.
And the one that's playing dead attacks

2117
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,880
and both of his dogs were a rap.
How big dogs?

2118
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:47,090
Small.
I mean there were smaller dogs,

2119
01:32:47,091 --> 01:32:49,910
but now he has like big German shepherds
and he's,

2120
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,800
you know,
he's kind of like got bigger dogs now.

2121
01:32:51,801 --> 01:32:53,570
But it was really sad,
man.

2122
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,300
It is a very tactical,
like very,

2123
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:58,010
very crazy.

2124
01:32:58,290 --> 01:32:58,741
Yeah.
They,

2125
01:32:58,741 --> 01:33:02,430
they figure out some way to work and
cooperate together without

2126
01:33:02,431 --> 01:33:04,190
communicating.
It's very interesting.

2127
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:07,230
Like if it wasn't so sad that they're
killing someone's pat,

2128
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,180
it's,
it's really kind of fascinating that

2129
01:33:09,181 --> 01:33:11,490
they're so smart that they would play
dead.

2130
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:17,670
There was a guy that used to work at
this pet store that I go to and he also

2131
01:33:17,671 --> 01:33:21,060
worked in a veterinary center,
a medical place,

2132
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:25,070
and a pit bull came in.
Big One of those big Jack pitbulls just

2133
01:33:25,071 --> 01:33:27,480
covered and cuts,
cuts all over its body.

2134
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:29,390
And uh,
the owner was,

2135
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:31,350
they asked the owner like,
what the fuck happened?

2136
01:33:31,351 --> 01:33:32,250
He goes,
I don't know.

2137
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,500
He goes,
I came home and he's covered in cots.

2138
01:33:34,501 --> 01:33:36,300
I really have no idea what happened to
them.

2139
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,380
So they stitched the dog up like
hundreds of stitches all over the dog's

2140
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:42,930
body.
Then he takes a walk outside of his

2141
01:33:42,931 --> 01:33:47,580
house and he follows his dog's blood and
he goes up into the hills near his house

2142
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:49,860
and he finds nine dead coyotes.

2143
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,120
Wow.
That pit pole was

2144
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:57,660
apparently tear and he said it looked
like Vietnam.

2145
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:01,770
It looked like a fucking like saving
private Ryan just ripped apart coyotes.

2146
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,010
Nine of them.
This motherfucker just went mall and

2147
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,850
they must have been so bummed out to
like this dog.

2148
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:09,720
Yeah,
there's nine of us.

2149
01:34:09,721 --> 01:34:10,440
We're good.
We're good.

2150
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,580
We got this guy here and then you see
this fucking fire hydrant head.

2151
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:17,730
Just
that doesn't feel pain.

2152
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,720
They've engineered those things.
Like there's some pit bulls.

2153
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:24,630
This pit bull.
If you go on Instagram,

2154
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:26,700
I think it's.
I am the hulk.

2155
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:29,790
That's the name of the.
It's a 200 pound pit bull.

2156
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:31,710
Like they've gotten them to 200 pounds.
Now.

2157
01:34:31,711 --> 01:34:35,130
It's the most preposterous thing you've
ever seen your life it looks like.

2158
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,940
Like,
like Brock Lesnar,

2159
01:34:38,941 --> 01:34:41,280
if it was a pit bull,
it's like it doesn't even make any

2160
01:34:41,281 --> 01:34:43,500
sense.
You look at it like a pit bull used to

2161
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:45,900
be like a 35 pound dog.
These to be small.

2162
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:48,110
Look at that thing.
Yeah.

2163
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,730
Are.
Imagine if a coyote saw that.

2164
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,810
Fuck.
Yeah,

2165
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:56,380
those bull Max.
This is fucking scary too.

2166
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:58,763
Oh

2167
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:01,430
yeah.
I had a master if he passed away

2168
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:03,350
recently.
I was 13 years old.

2169
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,770
We had to put him down and it was really
sad.

2170
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,200
He was.
He was a great dog.

2171
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:13,340
Mastiffs are so sweet.
Like look at the size of that fucking

2172
01:35:13,341 --> 01:35:14,180
dog,
man.

2173
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:19,250
Fuck.
Just go to just crazy 200 pound pit

2174
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:23,060
bull.
It's just so crazy that they make them

2175
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:26,480
that big now.
Like 100 pound pit bull used to be a

2176
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:27,890
bit.
I had a 90 pound one.

2177
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,430
It was a big dog and it was like wow,
that's a big pit bull.

2178
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:34,580
And like as a big pit bull,
this dogs 110 pounds bigger.

2179
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:35,960
Maybe it doesn't even make any sense.

2180
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:43,290
So fucking tank.
Yeah,

2181
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:45,470
but that.
That's one of my favorite coyote death,

2182
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:48,290
death stories.
This guy going up into the hills and

2183
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:51,080
find all these dead coyote just laying
in a pile.

2184
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:53,180
They try to ambush them.
When they would do,

2185
01:35:53,181 --> 01:35:57,080
they try to get one to come out and try
to get chased and then the one would run

2186
01:35:57,230 --> 01:36:00,410
and then the other ones would jump it.
There's like a gang straight up.

2187
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:03,860
That's crazy that they think like that
though.

2188
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:06,260
The fact that they have actually have
strategies,

2189
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,060
they're savages,
you know?

2190
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:11,930
Well that's the downside of living in
the suburbs,

2191
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,210
you know,
the upside is you get a nice yard and

2192
01:36:14,211 --> 01:36:17,900
he'd get a little view and yeah.
I love getting away from the city or

2193
01:36:17,901 --> 01:36:18,734
like,
you know,

2194
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,040
it's like studio or just chaos,
whatever.

2195
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:23,890
Just going home and being home.
Yeah,

2196
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:24,733
me too.
Nice.

2197
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:26,800
Do you ever keep,
do you keep a place up in big bear

2198
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:29,510
anywhere?
I don't go up there.

2199
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:32,300
I don't really like traveling really?
Nah,

2200
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:34,250
after my accident I fucking hate
traveling.

2201
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:38,970
Like I'll go on tour but I won't even
look at an itinerary before I go on

2202
01:36:38,971 --> 01:36:40,880
tour.
I just Kinda like just tell me where to

2203
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:42,260
go.
I'll be up.

2204
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:44,300
I'll be where I need to be,
but yeah,

2205
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,790
like I don't want to and I don't fly,
you know,

2206
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,800
I haven't flown since my accident.
So.

2207
01:36:48,801 --> 01:36:51,230
Wow.
So all your touring you do is by bus,

2208
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,380
by bus and then I'll take the Queen Mary
two to Europe.

2209
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:58,460
But
do you take a boat to Europe?

2210
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,690
Yeah.
Manager of your boat.

2211
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,790
Sunk.
Know on a fucking float,

2212
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:03,920
Raf going mother fucker.
Yeah,

2213
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,560
trust me.
But you know what?

2214
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:11,510
I'd rather be on the fucking raft then
fucking plummeting into the ocean at 100

2215
01:37:11,511 --> 01:37:12,530
miles per hour or whatever.

2216
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:13,690
Yeah.
I feel you.

2217
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:17,900
I'm to like take Guna for like quick
getaways,

2218
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:19,700
like you know,
just chill out with the family.

2219
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:21,530
So if you guys have a Gig in New York
City,

2220
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:24,140
you have to start your journey five days
early.

2221
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,830
Yeah.
Wow.

2222
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,310
But it's cool.
The kids and I get to see a lot of stuff

2223
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,640
we don't normally see.
Yeah.

2224
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:35,080
But I got to really think about it like,
like that fucking fire festival if they

2225
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:40,070
had booked us on and I was like,
I'm so glad because I would have had to

2226
01:37:40,071 --> 01:37:42,650
drive five or six days,
you know,

2227
01:37:42,651 --> 01:37:44,330
to uh,
Florida to Fort Lauderdale,

2228
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,570
then get in a boat and then get over to
the bomb as.

2229
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:49,850
So thank God man.
Because I was,

2230
01:37:49,851 --> 01:37:52,070
I was literally on my way there.
Wow.

2231
01:37:52,071 --> 01:37:54,340
So when you do that,
do you actually drive yourself or do you

2232
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:55,590
have someone drive?
You know,

2233
01:37:55,591 --> 01:38:00,060
I'd be white knuckling driving the tour
bus if you driven a fucking scary man

2234
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,040
while you driving like this.

2235
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,920
I've done it like wow.
Like when I was 19 or 20,

2236
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:08,130
when I was on a tour,
the driver let me drive and it was the

2237
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:09,660
scariest fucking thing.
I was like,

2238
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:13,500
take the fucking wheel man.
This is so like a white knuckling,

2239
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:18,390
like just being in control,
being responsible over that big of a

2240
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:20,730
bus.
And all of my homeys are all your

2241
01:38:20,731 --> 01:38:22,260
friends are sleeping in it.
Oh.

2242
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,270
So it's like,
oh gosh man,

2243
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:28,860
I give it bus drivers or that's a hard
fucking job and a drive for,

2244
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,440
you know,
I think we usually do eight to 10 hour

2245
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:34,380
days a day bus.
It's a long time.

2246
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,750
It is a long time.
So it's quite a drive.

2247
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,400
But in,
you know,

2248
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:41,880
they have to stay awake and maintain
their focus and I don't know about you

2249
01:38:41,881 --> 01:38:45,780
but when I see those white lines to
something about that,

2250
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:46,800
it's not good for me.

2251
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,350
I start non.
Yeah.

2252
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:51,210
It's like hypnotizing.
It is hypnotized.

2253
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,760
You can do like two or three hours and
I'm cool.

2254
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,550
I don't exactly know.
San Diego is about as far as I want to

2255
01:38:56,551 --> 01:38:57,270
drive.
Yeah.

2256
01:38:57,270 --> 01:39:00,700
They're built different and I know fuck,
you know,

2257
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:04,770
they say it's way more dangerous to be
on the road in a bus or on a car than

2258
01:39:04,771 --> 01:39:06,720
being in a plane.
But um,

2259
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,370
I don't know,
one day I always say like,

2260
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,130
my kids want to fly one day,
maybe I'll be down.

2261
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,520
But the thought of me leaving to go play
some show or do something cool and

2262
01:39:17,821 --> 01:39:20,370
something happening while they're at
home like fucks me up.

2263
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,500
So I don't really do it.
I know what you mean.

2264
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:23,910
I can only imagine.
I mean,

2265
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:26,790
I don't think anybody's ever going to be
able to understand what you've gone

2266
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:29,280
through with that kind of an ordeal.

2267
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:34,600
That plane crash where your friends died
and the pilots are dead and you managed

2268
01:39:34,651 --> 01:39:38,790
to get out alive but almost lost your
foot and burned half your body plus.

2269
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,620
Yeah.
No fuck man.

2270
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,620
It's crippling.
But I try not to let it be too much of a

2271
01:39:43,621 --> 01:39:47,460
handicap for traveling,
but seemed like you seem like you got to

2272
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:49,260
work around.
You figured it out.

2273
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:51,080
Yeah.
But Australia can go fuck itself.

2274
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,130
Oh,
I wish I could go.

2275
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,630
I said I love Australia.
I love Japan.

2276
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:58,710
I love Japan.
Do you guys go there for UFC fights?

2277
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:00,540
Yeah.
Have been fucking love it.

2278
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,850
They did the UFC in Tokyo once.
It was great.

2279
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,920
I honestly wanted to move there.
Really?

2280
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,480
Yeah.
I loved it so much.

2281
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:08,400
David Lee Roth moved there for a while.
Yeah,

2282
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:10,740
he,
he moved there to take sword fighting

2283
01:40:10,741 --> 01:40:12,450
classes.
Fuck yeah.

2284
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,730
Moved down with his dog,
got an apartment.

2285
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:16,290
He is the.
Have you ever talked to him?

2286
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:18,540
Now?
He is one of the trippiest fucking God.

2287
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:22,920
I just got a message really recently
that he wanted to talk to me and so they

2288
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:25,320
gave me a phone number for him.
I sent him a text message and never

2289
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:27,630
heard back.
So like I might have to call them like,

2290
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:28,950
I don't know,
I don't want to miss it out.

2291
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:30,330
So if Dave,
if you're listening.

2292
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:34,710
I tried twice but he said he wanted to
get ahold of me for something and they

2293
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:36,720
gave him a number.
They gave me a number to get ahold of

2294
01:40:36,721 --> 01:40:38,580
him,
but he's one of the more interesting

2295
01:40:38,581 --> 01:40:42,680
people I've ever talked to in my life.
Worked as an emt for a while when he,

2296
01:40:42,681 --> 01:40:44,870
he'd just gotten out of Van Halen.
Really?

2297
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:46,860
Yes,
like an actual emt,

2298
01:40:46,861 --> 01:40:50,310
like helping people like in New York and
people be like,

2299
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,200
what are you fucking David Lee Roth?

2300
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,033
And be like,
Hey,

2301
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:55,460
we're getting in the ambulance,
like tv,

2302
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,120
keep it together.
They like strapped to a Gurney when

2303
01:40:58,121 --> 01:41:00,830
there had accidents and shit and fucking
date.

2304
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:04,090
You imagine you get in a car accident
and fucking David Lee Roth is going to

2305
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:04,721
help you.
You're like,

2306
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:05,950
what?
What am I?

2307
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,910
I'm asked to be dead.
This isn't real life magic.

2308
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,050
Fucking David Lee Roth.
So that's fine.

2309
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:14,590
But that's legendary.
I love that.

2310
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:15,790
I love.
He's a trip.

2311
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:17,380
Yeah,
that'd be a great interview.

2312
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,980
Move to Japan with his dog.
Just just hung out.

2313
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:21,761
There I go.
What are you doing?

2314
01:41:21,761 --> 01:41:25,180
He's like taking Kendo lessons.
It's taking sword fighting lessons from

2315
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:27,020
a Japanese master.
Whoa.

2316
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:31,390
So everyday be take,
taking fucking Kendo sick.

2317
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,030
He's uh,
he's the real deal,

2318
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:35,680
man.
He's a real deal.

2319
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,740
Like a real eccentric but a really
friendly,

2320
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:40,410
really interesting guy.
Yeah.

2321
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:42,340
Well that's awesome.
Yeah.

2322
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:46,370
I love when someone is like that,
you know,

2323
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:48,730
like your friend that hasn't taught for
22 years.

2324
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,610
I love shit like that.
You don't hear about that?

2325
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:55,240
No.
Or someone that'll stopping and van

2326
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:58,630
Halen to go fuck with sorts.
Aliens.

2327
01:41:58,860 --> 01:41:59,693
Yeah.
It goes,

2328
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:02,470
fucks with all.
Do to think they're really bringing him

2329
01:42:02,471 --> 01:42:06,640
to the Pentagon and shit like that.
I don't know because he said that like,

2330
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:10,450
I have no clue and I had watched a
little bit of your podcast where you

2331
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:13,390
were like,
you sent me a text message,

2332
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:16,560
can you,
you know,

2333
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:21,780
but I feel like he's made himself
readily available to do that shit.

2334
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:22,804
You know,
like,

2335
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:25,300
I don't know.
It's a,

2336
01:42:25,301 --> 01:42:27,520
it's I,
I sit and scratch my head and go.

2337
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:28,930
I don't know.
I don't know either.

2338
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:33,130
I just fucking.
He's such a talented talented due to

2339
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,840
manny's like such a good songwriter.

2340
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,333
Yeah.
He.

2341
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:38,200
Well,
he certainly is certainly a very

2342
01:42:38,201 --> 01:42:40,270
talented guy.
It's just so interesting that that's his

2343
01:42:40,271 --> 01:42:41,610
main point of focus.
Yeah.

2344
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:43,930
I would think that if,
if aliens were real,

2345
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:46,510
trump would've told us.
I really do believe that.

2346
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:47,440
Yeah.
That guy is,

2347
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:51,010
he's such a fucking loose cannon.
He became the president.

2348
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:54,880
Like maybe they hid it from him or his
fucking chaotic is shit is right now.

2349
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:55,950
It was some,
I don't know,

2350
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,620
something would slip.
You know,

2351
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:58,520
I,
yeah.

2352
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:02,800
I would think that if they told him,
if they brought him a dose of two

2353
01:43:02,801 --> 01:43:05,410
things,
I would want to know who killed JFK.

2354
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:09,010
Those are two things I'd want to know if
I became the president and our aliens.

2355
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:09,970
Real.
What do you got?

2356
01:43:09,971 --> 01:43:11,410
Motherfucker?
What are you going?

2357
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:13,090
I go to the top generals.
I bet.

2358
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,950
Look,
I'm going to defer to you guys.

2359
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:16,780
I'm not a military expert.
Okay.

2360
01:43:16,781 --> 01:43:18,250
I mean,
I don't want war,

2361
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:20,380
but uh,
I want you guys to have support.

2362
01:43:20,381 --> 01:43:23,390
I got full respect.
Tell me about the elite.

2363
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:25,180
What do you got?
What's it trump orders?

2364
01:43:25,181 --> 01:43:27,070
Establishment of space for.
He did that.

2365
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,540
That's right.
The space fourth,

2366
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:32,930
but that's because there's actually a
military strategy because they're

2367
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:37,660
concerned that as technology improves,
Russians are going to be in space and

2368
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:41,830
we're going to be in space or war.
Fight off the aliens.

2369
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,810
Right?
Like will Smith Type Shit?

2370
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:45,173
Yeah.
Look at him.

2371
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:47,020
Yeah.
Mike pence is behind them going.

2372
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:48,040
Jesus was going to say almost.

2373
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,580
Yeah.
I don't know man.

2374
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:54,830
But if I became president and I never
will,

2375
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:56,870
but if I did,
those are the two things that I'd want

2376
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:59,960
to know who killed jfk and where the
fucking aliens.

2377
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:03,170
Do you think they know?
Do you think they know anything more

2378
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:05,300
than regular people?
Because you've got to feel like they

2379
01:44:05,301 --> 01:44:07,550
come in every four years.
Someone would open their mouth.

2380
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,470
Somebody knows.
Somebody knows

2381
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:15,980
he's an alien.
He's not going to rat on his friends.

2382
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:17,960
Right.
If you drive that car,

2383
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:20,540
I'll give you the cake.
Just take it for a tour or just take it

2384
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:21,830
for a spin out of here.
I will.

2385
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:23,870
That fucking tests will make you believe
in aliens.

2386
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:27,290
It doesn't even make sense.
It does not make sense.

2387
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:31,340
I feel like I'm driving a computer when
I'm in a tesla.

2388
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:35,690
It's like every car other than that
seems stupid.

2389
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:37,730
So the first one you've had.
Yes.

2390
01:44:38,290 --> 01:44:40,760
You're just completely in love with it.
Sold.

2391
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:43,040
Sold.
I drove one.

2392
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:47,790
There was a rental car company that was
sponsoring the podcast and it was like

2393
01:44:47,791 --> 01:44:49,280
a,
like uber for rental cars.

2394
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:51,740
They would drop off a rental car and
they would.

2395
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:52,850
Do you remember the name of that
company?

2396
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:56,780
I don't know if they're around anymore.
Anyway,

2397
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:58,101
I said,
yeah,

2398
01:44:58,101 --> 01:44:59,900
I want to try a tesla,
and I drove it.

2399
01:44:59,901 --> 01:45:01,010
I was like,
this is kind of interesting,

2400
01:45:01,011 --> 01:45:03,590
but this was years ago,
like maybe five years ago.

2401
01:45:03,591 --> 01:45:08,591
Was that four years ago?
Five years ago it wasn't as impressive,

2402
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:13,760
but now I got the model s p 100 d,
this is what he told me to get.

2403
01:45:13,761 --> 01:45:14,361
So I said,
all right,

2404
01:45:14,361 --> 01:45:16,610
I'll get it.
I drove that thing.

2405
01:45:16,611 --> 01:45:18,740
The moment I drove it,
the very first,

2406
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:21,740
the first couple of feet,
like what is happening here?

2407
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,890
Like why is this going so fast?
It doesn't make sense.

2408
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:27,020
It's effortless.
Effortless.

2409
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:29,510
Like every other car on the road has to
accelerate.

2410
01:45:29,511 --> 01:45:31,810
It's like,
man man,

2411
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,800
this shit.
He just,

2412
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:37,220
it's instantaneously going 60 miles an
hour.

2413
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:38,520
I mean,
it just feels like it's,

2414
01:45:38,710 --> 01:45:40,520
it's happening in like blink,
blink,

2415
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:41,470
60.
Yeah.

2416
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:44,360
And fucking smooth and just.
You can't hear anything.

2417
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:46,790
I don't hear anything.
It handles great.

2418
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:48,140
It's quiet,
it's shit.

2419
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,930
It's comfortable.
Yeah.

2420
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,660
I'm fucked because dude,
I'm a gear head.

2421
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:53,360
I'm like,
you,

2422
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,530
I know you saw that blazer.
Yeah.

2423
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,533
Do.
That's dope.

2424
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:59,450
Yeah.
I tried building like my icon version of

2425
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:00,320
a blazer.
You know,

2426
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,160
who built that for you?
Uh,

2427
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:05,480
his name was del Moe.
He was over here in the valley so he did

2428
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:10,481
the ls swap and then I had another buddy
of mine painted and then I've just kind

2429
01:46:10,601 --> 01:46:12,410
of like ground up like suspension.

2430
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:15,920
But I feel like I should have replaced
the chassis and done everything like

2431
01:46:15,921 --> 01:46:17,810
that if I wanted it to be like a true
icon,

2432
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:21,280
but it's a bad fucking truck look and
truck.

2433
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:22,970
There it is.
That's so sick.

2434
01:46:22,971 --> 01:46:23,760
It's so,
you know,

2435
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,670
icons done some blazers.
Yeah,

2436
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:27,890
I saw when they did afterwards.
Oh,

2437
01:46:27,891 --> 01:46:29,660
so you have,
it's a full convertible.

2438
01:46:29,661 --> 01:46:32,000
No hard top God damn.
That looks good dude.

2439
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:33,200
Yeah,
I put a soft top on it,

2440
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:37,100
like a bikini top,
but summertime I just take it all off

2441
01:46:37,101 --> 01:46:39,710
but I have roll a roll cage too.
Sick.

2442
01:46:39,711 --> 01:46:41,780
I love it.
I love the lowered ones too,

2443
01:46:41,781 --> 01:46:43,610
like the slanted ones if so.
Nice.

2444
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,300
That's so nasty,
man.

2445
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:48,720
Is that the color you have?
Like a matte,

2446
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:51,830
it's such a cool matt like charcoal,
Mercedes Gray.

2447
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,040
God,
that looks good.

2448
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:54,600
Yeah,
it almost pops wheelies.

2449
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:57,270
It's so fucking strong is so much
horsepower.

2450
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,420
Which engine they put in there?
An ls three.

2451
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,170
Oh,
okay.

2452
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:02,390
What is,
how many horsepower is that?

2453
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:05,880
I think I'm at like 700.
So ridiculous.

2454
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,280
So ridiculous.
But besides that,

2455
01:47:08,281 --> 01:47:09,114
you know,
I had like,

2456
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:11,140
I had like 16 old schools.
I've actually,

2457
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,110
so you're really actually fell out of
love with them.

2458
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:17,130
It's kind of weird or I think I've spent
like my time with them and I'm ready to

2459
01:47:17,131 --> 01:47:21,380
like separate from them and move on and
maybe like get other stuff or like,

2460
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:23,730
I don't know,
I feel like it was a moment in time

2461
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:26,190
though.
I was like Kinda like Hoodrich in a

2462
01:47:26,191 --> 01:47:28,470
sense where I'm putting all my money
into cars.

2463
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:32,640
Like before I ever bought a house I had
like four caddies,

2464
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:34,890
you know,
and I was living in like a two story

2465
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,410
house,
a two bedroom house with a bunch of

2466
01:47:37,411 --> 01:47:38,660
friends.
But um,

2467
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:41,250
to that old red one behind you is dope.
What is that?

2468
01:47:41,251 --> 01:47:43,940
I still have that 53 chevy truck.
Oh,

2469
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:46,420
that looks cool.
Icon.

2470
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:49,750
Does some of those two.
You ever see the master masters?

2471
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:52,980
So he's got one for sale right now.
I saw it.

2472
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,090
Yeah.
Somebody,

2473
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:56,430
uh,
had one built and then just never drove

2474
01:47:56,431 --> 01:47:59,730
it.
And he's selling it is nasty dude.

2475
01:47:59,731 --> 01:48:01,580
I go over there and window shop all
that.

2476
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,660
Have you met him?
Johnson were cool.

2477
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,270
He's very cool.
He drove me there.

2478
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:07,110
This mass.
That one's available right now.

2479
01:48:07,111 --> 01:48:10,350
Look at that fucking thing.
He drove me in one of those and was like

2480
01:48:10,351 --> 01:48:12,830
hitting corners at 70.
Like I fucking,

2481
01:48:12,831 --> 01:48:13,950
I almost lost my breath.

2482
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:16,560
I was like,
this motherfucker is crazy,

2483
01:48:16,561 --> 01:48:19,710
but they really do perform their fucking
cars.

2484
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:23,640
Even my bronco even though it's so high,
so high off the ground,

2485
01:48:23,641 --> 01:48:26,350
you would think that thing handles like
shit and handles really good for,

2486
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,850
for something like that.
Is it like stock how it comes from icon?

2487
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:32,160
Like that same height or did you do
anything to Istock?

2488
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:34,860
Yeah,
he just does them all that way.

2489
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,710
And uh,
I was originally going to get an f made

2490
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:41,790
from him and I went there and I saw the
Bronco and person with that matte silver

2491
01:48:41,791 --> 01:48:43,500
and I was like,
Holy Shit.

2492
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,940
Did I go scrap the fucking F J we need
to get this going.

2493
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:50,710
So did you,
did you do the whole build out like you

2494
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:51,990
how?
How long did it take?

2495
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,470
Well it was on w you're on a waiting
list for a long time.

2496
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:58,260
And then I think the build took close to
a year.

2497
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:02,310
It's like close to a year.
Patient get me too far.

2498
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:04,140
But the key is like have it in the
thing,

2499
01:49:04,141 --> 01:49:06,270
just forget about it because then time
goes by.

2500
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:07,890
Do you drive it a lot?
All the time.

2501
01:49:07,891 --> 01:49:10,560
I dropped to the comedy store like two
or three nights a week,

2502
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:13,000
but since I got the Tesla I'm telling
you man,

2503
01:49:13,001 --> 01:49:15,720
it really ruined me.
It's ruined me.

2504
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:18,000
I'm a gearhead yeah.
Like old school.

2505
01:49:18,001 --> 01:49:22,070
Cause I have a 65 corvette with an ls.
[inaudible] supercharged drive that all

2506
01:49:22,071 --> 01:49:25,320
the time side pipe,
silver shape.

2507
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,720
I love it.
But it seems so dumb.

2508
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:30,470
It seems so don wants to drive a tesla.
Wow.

2509
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:31,560
It's effortless,
dude.

2510
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:35,610
It just goes shit.
It's like you're on fast forward.

2511
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:38,280
I need to check it out.
Everybody else is living in the past.

2512
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:41,130
Yeah.
Like maybe last year I used to have a,

2513
01:49:41,131 --> 01:49:43,840
um,
the wraith like the Rolls Royce.

2514
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:45,780
That's a sick car.
Bad car?

2515
01:49:45,781 --> 01:49:47,040
Yeah.
Do you have the ceiling with all the

2516
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:49,330
lights?
Looks like space.

2517
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:51,400
It was so sick.
But my buddy,

2518
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:52,300
my buddy John said,
hey,

2519
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,150
let's swap cars at wherever we were
driving.

2520
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:56,570
So I did.
And I was,

2521
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:58,300
I was,
I was really impressed.

2522
01:49:58,301 --> 01:49:59,350
It was,
it fucking,

2523
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,730
it was really,
really fast.

2524
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,980
Which one did he have?
Did he have the 100 day?

2525
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:06,070
I imagine it's the one before the one
you're talking about because it was a

2526
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:07,930
couple of years ago.
Those were fast.

2527
01:50:07,931 --> 01:50:09,460
Yeah.
But it was still impressive.

2528
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,020
You know,
those were fast.

2529
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:14,200
They're still fast,
but this one is fucking stupid.

2530
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:16,060
Yeah.
It doesn't make sense.

2531
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:19,240
It's like you,
it's like you're defying what you think

2532
01:50:19,241 --> 01:50:23,170
a thing can do and it has that big
fucking screen where it has all your

2533
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,080
information.
Yeah,

2534
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:26,093
yeah.
They're dope.

2535
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:28,930
He's a.
he's definitely a legend man.

2536
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,600
Elon Musk.
He's not as blow torch to like,

2537
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:32,434
he's fucking.

2538
01:50:34,890 --> 01:50:37,120
He lit that fucking thing up in the
hallway out here.

2539
01:50:37,121 --> 01:50:37,750
No.
Yeah,

2540
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:38,920
I thought I was going to burn the
building.

2541
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:41,120
I haven't even lit mine.
I'm so afraid of my sons.

2542
01:50:41,290 --> 01:50:42,250
Of course.
Animal.

2543
01:50:42,251 --> 01:50:43,660
I don't want him to know how to turn it
on.

2544
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:45,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2545
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:48,190
He gave it to me.
Put the fucking fuel in it and

2546
01:50:48,191 --> 01:50:48,851
everything.
I was learning.

2547
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:49,750
All right,
thanks.

2548
01:50:49,751 --> 01:50:52,540
Crazy.
Like comes bearing gifts.

2549
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,720
How many people give you a blowgun blow
torch?

2550
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,640
Torch con.
Which called.

2551
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:00,430
It's not a blow torch,
right?

2552
01:51:00,670 --> 01:51:01,600
No.
What does he call it?

2553
01:51:01,601 --> 01:51:04,680
It's not a.
it's not a bullet or not a blow torch.

2554
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:07,600
Is that what it's called?
That believe so.

2555
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:08,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

2556
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:12,160
Whatever it is,
there's a crazy picture online that we

2557
01:51:12,161 --> 01:51:16,930
put up of him shooting that fucking
thing out in the hallway and you're

2558
01:51:16,931 --> 01:51:18,340
like,
you can't tell them no.

2559
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:19,960
You know,
like no one tells them no,

2560
01:51:19,961 --> 01:51:22,210
he's got security around them and all
these fucking,

2561
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,840
all these mercenaries with guns.
No one saying,

2562
01:51:24,841 --> 01:51:26,830
hey,
he rose hard,

2563
01:51:26,831 --> 01:51:28,420
dude,
he's the Elon Musk.

2564
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:30,000
It's worth billions.
However,

2565
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,210
where it goes.
I mean he's.

2566
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:35,080
He's got to have security everywhere.
Guys come before him and case everything

2567
01:51:35,081 --> 01:51:36,220
out.
Yeah,

2568
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,083
look at him.

2569
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:43,420
What did I conic photo
with the Freak party sign above his

2570
01:51:43,421 --> 01:51:45,700
head.
It's almost like we planned it and

2571
01:51:45,701 --> 01:51:47,890
Steven Tyler,
that Steven Tyler's mugshot and the

2572
01:51:47,891 --> 01:51:52,330
background
crazy man he takes from your guys'

2573
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:54,880
interview to where he's just like
fucking stone.

2574
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:56,960
Be Honest.
So great.

2575
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:59,770
I don't think he got stoned.
I don't think he really inhaled.

2576
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:03,820
He took like a tiny puff.
I think he puffed it like a cigar

2577
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:06,100
smokes.
We didn't inhale.

2578
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,960
He drinks.
We drank.

2579
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:12,790
That's what was interesting about that.
The blowback or the backlash is that we

2580
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:16,210
drank for two hours before we even
busted out the weed,

2581
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:18,100
but the weed was like,
what are they doing?

2582
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:21,130
God takes one hit of weed.
What are they doing?

2583
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:25,720
And then it went crazy and stock
plummeted six percent,

2584
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:30,400
but it went back up to nine percent
smoke before you drink.

2585
01:52:30,401 --> 01:52:33,280
Right.
I think you get really fucked up if you

2586
01:52:33,281 --> 01:52:35,830
don't smoke a lot and you smoke after
you've been drinking.

2587
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:36,850
Really?
It's a wrap.

2588
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:37,783
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2589
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:39,750
I don't know.
He never seen it.

2590
01:52:39,751 --> 01:52:40,960
I don't think it affected him.
He was like,

2591
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,940
well,
he's so.

2592
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:45,770
His brain is wired so different.

2593
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,860
You know what his brain is like.
It's like you ever see like,

2594
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,500
okay,
no disrespect to Pete Holmes,

2595
01:52:51,501 --> 01:52:52,820
but you know Pete Holmes,
the comedian,

2596
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,640
like look at his body and then look at
Usain bolt's.

2597
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:59,540
That's how I feel like,
like the way if they had a race,

2598
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:03,500
that's how I feel like with my brain in
the room with Elan's brain,

2599
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:03,921
I was like,
well,

2600
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:08,000
these are barely the same thing.
Keep up man.

2601
01:53:08,001 --> 01:53:10,550
Like you.
You've had some crazy guests that are

2602
01:53:10,551 --> 01:53:13,460
talking about atoms and fucking the
universe and whatever else,

2603
01:53:13,461 --> 01:53:15,730
and you're always like,
you.

2604
01:53:15,731 --> 01:53:19,580
You keep up with everybody.
It's an illusion to memorize things.

2605
01:53:20,190 --> 01:53:21,470
Yeah.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

2606
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:21,861
about.
They know.

2607
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:24,050
They understand the actual concepts.
You know?

2608
01:53:24,051 --> 01:53:26,540
I might be able to repeat things that
I've learned in red,

2609
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,610
but I don't know what the fuck I'm
really talking about.

2610
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,500
They know what the fuck they're like,
you know what I'm saying?

2611
01:53:30,501 --> 01:53:34,190
It's like if someone never did Jujitsu
before and they want to talk about

2612
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:37,760
choking someone out a triangle and I
hear them say and I'm like,

2613
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:38,640
okay,
Yay.

2614
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:40,070
That's how you do it.
That's how you do it.

2615
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,770
But they don't really know how to do it.
You know what I'm saying?

2616
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:44,990
But then if you're talking to hoists
Gracie,

2617
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:46,910
he tells you how to choke someone out
with a triangle like this.

2618
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:49,580
Motherfucker did it.
He knows how to do it.

2619
01:53:49,581 --> 01:53:52,820
He does it all the time.
It's a different conversation,

2620
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:54,350
you know?
So that's the difference.

2621
01:53:54,351 --> 01:53:56,630
Like me,
I'm like a spectator talking to these

2622
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:59,840
geniuses,
but I just trying to pull information

2623
01:53:59,841 --> 01:54:01,880
out of them.
I'm just trying to get them to talk,

2624
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:05,420
you know,
I just try to know a little bit about

2625
01:54:05,421 --> 01:54:06,260
what they're talking about.

2626
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:08,450
The guys that were on a,
I don't know,

2627
01:54:08,451 --> 01:54:10,290
what was it last week,
the guys that we're talking about like

2628
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,450
longevity,
like living.

2629
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,150
Yeah,
Davidson,

2630
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:15,200
Clara.
That was pretty crazy.

2631
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:17,450
Fascinating.
Fascinating.

2632
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:18,650
Yeah.
This.

2633
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,390
I'm glad there's people like that out
there.

2634
01:54:20,391 --> 01:54:24,260
I think within the next 15 to 20 years,
people are going to start going back in

2635
01:54:24,261 --> 01:54:29,000
aging like legitimately they're going to
be able to not just slow down aging,

2636
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:32,780
but we're going to see like 60 year old
ladies are hot as fuck.

2637
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:35,600
We're going to see 60 year old ladies
looked at 32.

2638
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:38,810
I really believe that I do to coming
around the corner.

2639
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:41,950
Especially that guy who's talking about
that diabetic medicine that he takes

2640
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:43,340
metformin.
Yeah.

2641
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:44,690
Yeah.
But apparently,

2642
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:47,510
um,
that stuff has negative impacts on

2643
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:49,520
athletic performance.
It's one of the things that I was

2644
01:54:49,521 --> 01:54:53,120
curious about when,
when he discussed it and Dr Rhonda

2645
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:55,700
Patrick sent me something on it and Ben
Greenfield actually brought it up on the

2646
01:54:55,701 --> 01:54:56,180
podcast.

2647
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:59,120
We did a couple of days afterwards.
Uh,

2648
01:54:59,121 --> 01:54:59,801
yeah.
It's,

2649
01:54:59,801 --> 01:55:00,410
um,
I don't,

2650
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:02,540
it's,
it's probably good for longevity but not

2651
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:04,450
good for athletic performance,
which is a,

2652
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:08,150
I'm not willing to make that sacrifice
and he's probably not really concerned

2653
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:09,530
with athletic performance.
No,

2654
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:11,840
no.
He barely worked out and he wasn't into

2655
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:13,700
working out hard either.
Was like his,

2656
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:16,430
his deals,
like just maintain a little bit of

2657
01:55:16,431 --> 01:55:19,040
exercise,
just kind of keep the blood moving.

2658
01:55:19,041 --> 01:55:24,041
But a lot of those guys that are these
super genius sort of longevity experts,

2659
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:32,440
they're just interested in how you can
slow the clock down as much as possible.

2660
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:38,990
And then there's other people like Ben
Greenfield or like I'm Rhonda Patrick,

2661
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:42,260
they're more interested in performance.
Like what is,

2662
01:55:42,261 --> 01:55:46,200
what's the thing for you in terms of,
for your mental performance,

2663
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:49,140
physical performance.
I'm more in line with that,

2664
01:55:49,141 --> 01:55:50,940
but um,
but I'm also,

2665
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:52,980
I want to know what these guys are
working on.

2666
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:56,430
The Davidson Claire's of the world
because he's at the top of the,

2667
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,230
you know,
the tip of the spear when it comes to

2668
01:55:58,231 --> 01:56:01,450
longevity and,
and gene editing and you know,

2669
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:06,870
what they're talking about is being able
to inject certain what certain genes are

2670
01:56:08,101 --> 01:56:10,020
bacteria that carry genes.
It's going to fix it.

2671
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,300
Eyesight.
Wow.

2672
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:12,980
Yeah.
Crazy.

2673
01:56:12,981 --> 01:56:14,860
Crazy.
Like people that are blind are going to

2674
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:16,490
be able to see again,
like,

2675
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:17,330
yeah,

2676
01:56:17,330 --> 01:56:22,330
they're going to be able to do some mad,
mad shit as long as human beings don't.

2677
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:27,130
We don't figure out.
I mean we don't nuke ourselves or fuck

2678
01:56:27,131 --> 01:56:28,800
the world to a point where,
you know,

2679
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,020
scientific research halts.
If these guys can keep going,

2680
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:35,860
if we can make it to the next 50 years,
people are probably going to live to be

2681
01:56:35,861 --> 01:56:36,790
300 years old.

2682
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:37,990
Wow.
Yeah.

2683
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:39,950
Nuts,
man.

2684
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:42,400
I love it.
How fucking smart people are going to be

2685
01:56:42,401 --> 01:56:43,450
at the 300.
I mean,

2686
01:56:43,451 --> 01:56:45,490
think about how smart you are compared
to when you were 20.

2687
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:49,240
I was a dummy.
So done.

2688
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:51,160
I'm so dumb.
I'm amazed.

2689
01:56:51,161 --> 01:56:53,740
I'm still here.
Like I stop and think about how I used

2690
01:56:53,741 --> 01:56:55,800
to drive.
I'll say,

2691
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:58,780
oh,
oh,

2692
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:02,080
now you have old schools.
Do you have hot rods?

2693
01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:05,410
You have any hot rods?
Not Pretty much like Sullivan though,

2694
01:57:05,411 --> 01:57:08,860
like old schools.
Those are safer at a couple of impalas.

2695
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:13,360
I just got rid of two of my impalas and
I have like a 53 caddy.

2696
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:15,300
I still have.
I have a 64,

2697
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:22,620
60 5:53 truck in a 41 caddy 41 cat.
It's nice man.

2698
01:57:24,911 --> 01:57:27,400
It's really fucking Nice.
But it's like a three speed,

2699
01:57:27,401 --> 01:57:28,820
you know what I mean?
Like it's like it's,

2700
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:30,370
you know.
No,

2701
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:31,990
I'm old school power steering.

2702
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:35,410
It's like you gotta know how to drive.
So yeah,

2703
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,950
I still have a couple that I'm holding
onto but I really,

2704
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:40,360
we're steering.
Did steering wheel must be giants.

2705
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:42,600
Gigantic.
It's so sketchy to,

2706
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,200
to drive.
But yeah,

2707
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:46,000
I'm going to bring,
I'm going to bring a couple out.

2708
01:57:46,001 --> 01:57:49,510
I have a um,
I have a festival that happens in March

2709
01:57:49,511 --> 01:57:52,150
called music that's like tattoos,
music and cars.

2710
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:54,730
So I bring a couple of them out there.
Where's that?

2711
01:57:54,731 --> 01:57:57,060
At?
Orange County fairgrounds.

2712
01:57:57,190 --> 01:57:57,950
Oh,
all right.

2713
01:57:57,950 --> 01:57:59,020
Yeah.
Nice.

2714
01:57:59,080 --> 01:57:59,913
Nice.
Yeah.

2715
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:01,060
So,
but yeah,

2716
01:58:01,061 --> 01:58:02,650
but I'm slowly.
I really just,

2717
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,270
I don't know.
I want a simpler life man.

2718
01:58:04,271 --> 01:58:06,560
I want to be able to get in a car and
not worry about it.

2719
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:10,630
Fucking breaks down and I can get to
point a to point b with how busy I am.

2720
01:58:10,631 --> 01:58:11,560
I don't know.
Do it.

2721
01:58:11,561 --> 01:58:12,580
Stay the fuck away from that.

2722
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:13,480
Tesla.
Yeah.

2723
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:15,490
I'm telling you it'll ruin you.
Oh yeah,

2724
01:58:15,491 --> 01:58:16,750
there she is.
So that's yours.

2725
01:58:16,751 --> 01:58:18,070
Wow,
that's beautiful.

2726
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,210
What a car.
What?

2727
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:21,480
I mean,
what a like a,

2728
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:25,990
not just a car but of window into time.
Yeah,

2729
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:29,050
that's history.
I mean back in 1941.

2730
01:58:29,051 --> 01:58:30,760
That's what people drove,
man.

2731
01:58:30,761 --> 01:58:34,450
That was the shit back then.
People tooling around Manhattan and one

2732
01:58:34,451 --> 01:58:35,131
of those.
Yeah.

2733
01:58:35,131 --> 01:58:36,450
I love seeing those,
you know,

2734
01:58:36,451 --> 01:58:40,210
the movies that take place during those
timers and they find all those classics.

2735
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:41,290
So cool.
You know,

2736
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:44,170
it was great.
The more recent version of the great

2737
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:47,230
gatsby with Leonardo Dicaprio when they
drove those cars,

2738
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:52,180
but it was a weird movie because they
made those cars almost like modern.

2739
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,140
It's very strange.
That's how Romeo and Juliet was two.

2740
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:58,660
The one with the one with Leonardo.
You know what I'm talking about.

2741
01:58:58,661 --> 01:59:02,440
Did you notice that all the guns in
there were super ill cars,

2742
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:04,360
sick.

2743
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,980
They do some futuristic.
Yeah.

2744
01:59:05,981 --> 01:59:07,920
Some weird interpretation.
Yeah,

2745
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:09,550
a time period.
Correct,

2746
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:10,390
right.
Yeah.

2747
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:12,130
So that time period.
Correct.

2748
01:59:12,131 --> 01:59:15,550
But when he drove that car,
it drove like no fucking car.

2749
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:20,990
Like cvs find a scene where he actually
drove the car because it sounded like it

2750
01:59:21,971 --> 01:59:25,540
was supercharged and it's flying and
it's handling well,

2751
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:28,810
but it's all like cartoonish.
Almost like everything.

2752
01:59:28,811 --> 01:59:32,050
The scenes or like when they're driving
these cars,

2753
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,870
they're nothing like those cars were
back then.

2754
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:36,460
Oh yeah.
Because they don't move like that.

2755
01:59:37,410 --> 01:59:38,880
Especially in the road.
Yeah.

2756
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:41,380
Unless you do like an ls swap and you
read everything.

2757
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:44,350
Like when they're on the road,
like these fucking cars didn't drive

2758
01:59:44,351 --> 01:59:45,910
like that man.
They didn't.

2759
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:50,970
They'd have skinny ass bullshit tires.
They barely could break.

2760
01:59:51,190 --> 01:59:53,680
You hit the brakes.
It took forever to slow down.

2761
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:57,340
That was a great movie though.
Yeah,

2762
01:59:57,341 --> 01:59:58,330
those are sick.
Yeah.

2763
01:59:58,331 --> 01:59:59,680
See,
they're all going sideways around

2764
01:59:59,681 --> 02:00:01,660
corners and shit.
Nobody did that back then.

2765
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:03,743
It was weird.
Yeah.

2766
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:07,130
It's weird how they do that with movies
where they have this like they're having

2767
02:00:07,131 --> 02:00:09,290
a race.
We're racing.

2768
02:00:09,330 --> 02:00:14,330
I mean with that electric car outside
will follow by these motherfuckers show.

2769
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:21,500
The problem with those,
those Teslas is that once you get in one

2770
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:26,240
other cars just seem kind of dumb.
They seem kind of old.

2771
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:27,091
Oh,
I bet.

2772
02:00:27,091 --> 02:00:29,590
I feel like it's,
you're stepping into the future when you

2773
02:00:29,610 --> 02:00:32,910
drive those.
Anything else wouldn't seem even up to

2774
02:00:32,911 --> 02:00:33,744
date,
you know,

2775
02:00:34,010 --> 02:00:38,330
but there's something about cars like
you're 41 cadillac that have a theme to

2776
02:00:38,331 --> 02:00:41,120
them that you're never going to get from
a new car.

2777
02:00:41,210 --> 02:00:43,670
And you know,
what's cool about those is like when

2778
02:00:43,671 --> 02:00:46,340
you're in those,
you're not concerned with whatever's on

2779
02:00:46,341 --> 02:00:49,580
the radio or talking on the phone or I
don't know,

2780
02:00:49,581 --> 02:00:53,570
you're into just your content with just
hearing the car and driving.

2781
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:54,920
You know,
driving is fun.

2782
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,720
Yeah.
Whereas like if you're just in 2019

2783
02:00:59,721 --> 02:01:01,670
chevy truck,
you're not going to feel like that,

2784
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:03,560
you know,
you take it that far back.

2785
02:01:03,561 --> 02:01:05,180
Just the smell of them.
Everything.

2786
02:01:05,181 --> 02:01:06,014
It's a,
it's a,

2787
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,760
it's a vibe and it's just.
I don't know.

2788
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:10,010
You can't compare it to anything.
Yeah.

2789
02:01:10,011 --> 02:01:12,710
When I bought my 65 corvette,
the first thing I do is pull the radio

2790
02:01:13,190 --> 02:01:14,390
gear.
That outta here.

2791
02:01:14,391 --> 02:01:16,820
I don't want to hear that radio is
unnecessarily.

2792
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,890
Yeah,
I want to have those side pipes in the

2793
02:01:18,891 --> 02:01:23,600
wind,
but it's going to be a thing of the

2794
02:01:23,601 --> 02:01:24,434
past.
Man.

2795
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:27,590
I really firmly believe that now after
driving this car,

2796
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:29,990
I think 50 years from now those things
are going to be.

2797
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:32,870
It's going to be like seeing some guy
drive by on a model.

2798
02:01:32,871 --> 02:01:35,600
T engines are going to be a thing of the
past.

2799
02:01:35,601 --> 02:01:37,340
It's probably better for the environment
anyway.

2800
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:38,383
Oh,
for sure.

2801
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:42,710
Anyway,
I think that's it.

2802
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:44,720
Let's wrap this up.
Dope Dude.

2803
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:46,820
Thank you so much.
I was really glad we got together,

2804
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:48,610
man.
It was great.

2805
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,890
Very cool talking to you.
Awesome.

2806
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:51,010
Likewise.
Um,

2807
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:55,130
social media.
Your instagram is just Travis Barker

2808
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:59,270
Barker and use twitter as well or just
he asked St Charles Barker.

2809
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,350
Beautiful.
Thanks brother.

2810
02:02:00,351 --> 02:02:01,010
Really appreciate it,
man.

2811
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:01,560
It was fun.
