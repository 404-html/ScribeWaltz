1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,010
Could even hear their breathing.
It's a sensitive.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,480
Yeah.
It's good stuff.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,570
Lab already.
Damn.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,150
There's no countdown.
Jamie.

5
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:13,620
You're radical.
Radical.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,800
Mr Goes in.
Go back to be here.

7
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,634
Thanks Mr Lindsay.
Good to James or Jim depending upon 

8
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,000
preferences.
That's right.

9
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,400
Go with Jim a jet.
First of all gentlemen.

10
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,980
And there was one other person that you 
did this with.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,950
This whole project.
Helen pluck rose from England.

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,130
A shout out to Helen from England.
She back across the pond,

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,260
right?
He's across the pond.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,000
Fish and chips and she's making tea and 
managerial magazine.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,110
That's great.
Excellent.

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,430
Alright,
well shout out to her as well.

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,533
Um,
let's explain what you guys did and 

18
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:49,521
what's so significant about it because 
when I first read it,

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,550
my first inclination that I had two 
reactions.

20
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,384
One was a huge laugh.
I laughed really hard and then I said 

21
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,470
thank God so many exposed this.
Yup.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,800
So tell me,
tell me what you guys do over.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,320
Let's explain who you guys are,
what you do.

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,263
Okay.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,700
Um,
my background is in mathematics.

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,790
I bailed out an academia in 2010 though 
because I kind of see the writing on the

27
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,904
wall and uh,
so now I am a renegade gender scholar 

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,280
and I write nonsense about genitals.

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,190
That's primarily what I do.
I mean,

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,400
I manage a business at home,
so I got to academia.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,213
Yeah.
And I'm uh,

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,093
uh,
I teach philosophy of Portland State 

33
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,200
University and uh,
met Jim years ago,

34
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,034
we collaborated and we've written a 
number of things over the years and at 

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,240
some point it just came to the,
we had to do something about this.

36
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:48,140
It was just too ridiculous and it was 
translating into the real world.

37
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,070
And so we collaborated and here we are.
Well,

38
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,310
let's explain what you did and what was 
ridiculous.

39
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:57,170
Um,
what we're talking about,

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,200
what was ridiculous is there's many 
fields of studies,

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,113
um,
that you can get legitimate degrees in 

42
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,960
that are absolutely preposterous,
right?

43
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,170
Literally filled with nonsense,
taught by nonsense.

44
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:14,930
People who live in these nonsense 
bubbles,

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,793
right?
And then they give these degrees and 

46
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:21,350
these people go out in the real world 
and they infect things.

47
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,710
They in their,
their ridiculousness infect certain,

48
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,450
particularly tech industry businesses 
like you see it in King James.

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,450
Yeah.
Well it's explained what you guys did.

50
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,790
Yeah,
so we started about a year,

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,560
I guess a year and a half ago now is 
last summer.

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,663
We started writing a bunch of academic 
papers for the journals that represent 

53
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:42,834
these fields and so everybody 
understands what an academic paper is 

54
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:45,864
getting out of the gate.
This isn't like an op Ed that you dash 

55
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,580
off or like Washington Post or some 
magazine or whatever.

56
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,773
This is a thing like academics work 
their careers to write one or two of 

57
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:59,200
these a year.
And so they're really hard to write.

58
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,060
They're supposed to be hard to get 
published.

59
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,450
So we were up 20 of them in 10 months 
and uh,

60
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,960
seven of those got accepted for,
were actually published.

61
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,110
And um,
then we got lost for more.

62
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,760
Yeah,
we got busted and at least four more.

63
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,594
We're on track.
Maybe five or six more would've gotten 

64
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,054
in.
What's the difference between getting 

65
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,950
accepted and getting published?

66
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,783
So the process with everything in 
academia is really slow and a lot of 

67
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,440
people don't know this,
so you send off this article,

68
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,813
the editor looks at it and the editor 
either gives it the thumbs up or the 

69
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,050
thumbs down.
If they give it the thumbs up,

70
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:32,884
it goes off to peer reviewers and that 
process takes months often as long as I 

71
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,090
mean would one paper that was eight 
months under peer review.

72
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,343
So the reviewers look at it,
they try to figure out if the arguments 

73
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,374
are good,
they try to figure out if the research 

74
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,830
is good,
they evaluate that,

75
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,230
they give extensive comments,
they send it back to you,

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,020
then you have to revise it according to 
whatever they say.

77
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,180
Make it better is what's supposed to 
happen.

78
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,600
They made ours crazier and so then they 
did.

79
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,434
Every single time

80
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,620
we took the feedback and made the papers
just the most extreme,

81
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,080
most extreme things and so then you send
them back.

82
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,950
So now you're probably three,
four months in just the review process,

83
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,200
not to the writing,
which should also take months.

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,513
And then the editor will either send it 
back to the reviewers to see if it was 

85
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,594
good enough or they'll just evaluated 
themselves depending on where it stands 

86
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,650
and then they'll make a decision as to 
whether or not to accept it or reject it

87
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,440
or ask for more revisions.
And then when they accept it,

88
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,030
that means the is ready to publish it.
But then the publishing process requires

89
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,770
all the typesetting,
proofing,

90
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,340
all the stuff that goes into making it 
professional for an academic journal.

91
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,500
And that can take months

92
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,320
and,
and,

93
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,260
and publishing is the coin of the realm 
like fats it.

94
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,640
So the ideal is one paper every year in 
the humanities probably.

95
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,360
So if you,
that's how you credential yourself.

96
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,670
That's how you get tenure,
which is a job for life.

97
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,610
That's how you get to teach people these
ideas who then,

98
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,500
as you said,
go out into the workforce,

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,161
you know,
five,

100
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:57,994
six years later.
And in fact everybody with total 

101
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,220
silliness.
So the,

102
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,270
it's the gold standard peer review.
So we saw a tremendous problem.

103
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,720
Can we tell people some of the titles of
these charter?

104
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:12,580
Because right now they're like,
what the hell are these guys talking?

105
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,263
So we had a article,
the one that got the most press was 

106
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,310
about dog humping and Portland,
Oregon.

107
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,590
It was called.
How did it go?

108
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:25,210
Was it called um,
queer performativity and uh,

109
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,300
was it rape culture,
rape culture?

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,670
We're performativity in dog parks in 
Portland or.

111
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,743
Yeah,
we claim to have examined under a fake 

112
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,640
name is formativity.
Oh yeah,

113
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,230
totally.
Have their own lingo.

114
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,340
Their own,
you know.

115
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,560
But is that a word in the English 
language before

116
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,440
activity?
I mean in the academic English language.

117
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:45,870
Not In common parlance,
but that's like the whole thing.

118
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:46,740
This is huge,
right?

119
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,040
This goes back a long way.
That's Judith Butler.

120
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,480
His whole thing was that gender 
different?

121
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,383
Butler.
Judith Butler is probably the most 

122
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:57,920
influential feminist scholar there.
Gender scholar I should say,

123
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,340
that that's been in maybe the last 30 
years.

124
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,960
She's,
she's big time.

125
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,350
And so she had this whole thing that 
gender is performative.

126
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,184
It's something you perform.
It's not something that has anything to 

127
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,404
do with your biology treated article.
Reactions to rape culture in Queer 

128
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,130
performativity at urban dog parks in 
Portland,

129
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,020
Oregon.
Why is it retracted?

130
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,650
Because it's because I realized bogus.
We're hosing them,

131
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,890
we reactions to rape culture and queer 
performance.

132
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:29,891
We claim to have closely examined the 
genitals of just under 10,000,

133
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:30,754
210,000
dogs and then interrogated their owners 

134
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,120
as to their sexual orientation.

135
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,370
So we checked out the dog's nuts and 
then said,

136
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,660
excuse me sir,
are you gay?

137
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,910
And if they gendered their dogs,
well we made up these totally insane,

138
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,550
you know,
dogs humping incidents and how they,

139
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,240
they beat female dogs but they didn't 
beat male dogs.

140
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,770
So that's one of the papers that we 
made,

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,990
you know the other paper that will,
will this one also,

142
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,800
they had the whole thing like if a male 
dog humps another male dog,

143
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,960
especially men would freak out and break
it up.

144
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,780
Stop that because that's the queer 
performativity part.

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
But then if a male dog humped a female 
dog,

146
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:08,830
they'd be like,
you know,

147
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,580
get her girl.
Get her,

148
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,240
get her,
you know,

149
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,073
get on it.
You're basically raging against Hetero 

150
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,330
normativity.
Exactly correct.

151
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,193
We told them exactly what they wanted to
hear and we gave them bogus statistics 

152
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,480
to fuel what they already wanted to 
believe.

153
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,383
Yeah.
We started off with the idea that what 

154
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,134
we wanted to get to as a conclusion and 
then we made up all the crap in between 

155
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:29,504
to get to it and the conclusion was 
feminism should train men the way we 

156
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,490
train dogs so that we can get rid of 
rape culture.

157
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,900
They'll put them on leashes,
you know,

158
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,180
it's right in the paper.
It's all there.

159
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,200
Unfortunately we cannot put them in 
Aleisha.

160
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,540
It's not politically feasible to put men
on leashes.

161
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,583
You guys wrote that.
He had told their leashes when they 

162
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,960
misbehave in this paper,
didn't just get published.

163
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,830
The Journal said that this was exemplary
scholarship and gave it an award.

164
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,850
So it was one of the best pieces.
This year is their 25th anniversary.

165
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:02,834
So this journal's has been doing this 
for 25 years and it's their 25th 

166
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,670
anniversary.
So they're picking out the best papers.

167
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,150
So pull year and putting them,
you know,

168
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,023
pride of place in some,
some issue of the journal and ours was 

169
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,820
going to be in the seventh issue was so 
number one is greater,

170
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:20,060
it's not great.
So it either is greater,

171
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:24,380
it's not great like why they retracting 
it because they know we were bogus.

172
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:29,381
So what?
Like a broken clock.

173
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,810
The clock is broken,
what it is actually 12:00.

174
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,790
So they would claim it's incorrectly 
that we fabricated statistics but we,

175
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,690
we wrote other paper's called one was 
fat bodybuilding,

176
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,524
so that claim that there should be a 
category introducing traditional body 

177
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:46,664
building called fat body bodybuilding 
where people come and display their fat 

178
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,773
before the audience and we didn't 
manufacturing and statistics for that 

179
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,590
and they love that.

180
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,540
They thought it.
You know,

181
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,560
one line in that paper was a fat body is
a built body of the reviewers.

182
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,890
Like I wholeheartedly agree.
Something like that.

183
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,643
Yeah.
And then we wrote other papers like to 

184
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,770
Hypatia we published a paper,
got accepted,

185
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:11,604
not published,
but that one we claim that it's 

186
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,630
unacceptable.
It's honestly,

187
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,590
it's unethical to make fun of anything 
to do with social justice.

188
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,380
Right?
And so if you want to make fun of things

189
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,940
that don't have anything with social 
justice,

190
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,400
that's good.
So if we wanted to make fun of men,

191
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,230
that's great.
If you want to make fun of white people,

192
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:29,064
that's great.
If you want to make fun of anything to 

193
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,670
do with social justice,
that's a problem.

194
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,504
So we made was.
We said that South Park is a huge 

195
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,620
problem.
The simpsons is a huge problem.

196
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,993
We went into talking about how Stephen 
Colbert and Jon Stewart have the right 

197
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,400
idea,
but then the journal was like,

198
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,940
oh,
but they're straight white male.

199
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:46,774
So you have to nuance around that to 
make it clear that their position is 

200
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,680
white men even though they're on the 
side of social justice,

201
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,040
it's not quite good enough,
you know.

202
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,280
So they publish that.
They published that,

203
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,410
they published that.
Was that.

204
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,313
What was that one called?
That one was called when the joke's on 

205
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:06,210
you and we made.
We wrote it.

206
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,630
They would think the joke is on us 
because we cited our own work in there,

207
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,390
but the joke was actually on them for 
publishing it.

208
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,020
Yeah,
yeah,

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,440
yeah,
yeah.

210
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,953
It's so.
It's so funny how racist you can be as 

211
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,560
long as you're racist against white 
people.

212
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,403
That's what we saw is that as long as 
you are going up the river against 

213
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,874
privileged,
then you can really just get away with 

214
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,034
some.

215
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,650
And you could generalize.
Oh,

216
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,420
totally gross generalizations.
It's not treat people as individuals.

217
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,580
Absolutely.
It's very strange.

218
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,520
It's very strange that this is the left,
you know,

219
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,060
I was a kid in San Francisco in the 19 
seventies.

220
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,040
Uh,
we lived in,

221
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,180
you know,
like was the hippie times and that's,

222
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,043
I,
I lived there from age seven to 11 and 

223
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,160
it kind of formed a lot of my opinions 
about people like that who gives a shit.

224
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,840
Part of my,
my,

225
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,370
my appreciation for any group,
whatever it is,

226
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,050
whether it's race or gender or sexual 
orientation and I just,

227
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,393
I don't understand it from either way.
I certainly don't understand it from a 

228
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:14,634
racist perspective,
but I really don't understand it from 

229
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,870
racism that's condoned because it's 
racism against white people.

230
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,470
This is the left,
this is the.

231
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,343
These are,
these are the people that are preaching 

232
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,894
against hate and these are the people 
that used to be the people that were 

233
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:31,644
supposedly so open minded and so open to
ideas and now they're trying to stifle 

234
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,770
creativity and stifled dissent and 
stifle,

235
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,010
stifle anything that doesn't fit inside 
that very narrow paradigm they're trying

236
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,880
to push.
It's very strange.

237
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,240
No,
they co opted the civil rights movement.

238
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,074
The good name of the civil rights 
movement is kind of the brand they ride 

239
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:53,891
on.
You know,

240
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:56,920
they're fighting against racism.
They're fighting against sexism,

241
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,060
misogyny,
et Cetera,

242
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,403
and the thing is,
is that's not really what's going on 

243
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,120
here.
They've actually tapped into this to,

244
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,013
to throw around the term,
this postmodern notion that everything 

245
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:08,464
in society has to do with power dynamics
and the power dynamics have to be 

246
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,913
understood in terms of groups and how 
those groups have traditionally held 

247
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:15,064
power and exercise power.
And so immediately it becomes stuck in 

248
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:22,120
this idea that it's all about this group
or that group and how they relate to one

249
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,320
another.
And I don't mean like,

250
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,530
Hey,
let's get along relate.

251
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,373
I mean like white people are imagined to
always be over black people and 

252
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,580
therefore,
you know,

253
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,770
there's always as natural power dynamic 
of,

254
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,870
of,
of oppressor versus oppressed.

255
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,003
And this is stuff that came straight out
of this weird postmodern philosophy 

256
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:42,910
where you said he's dissatisfied French 
philosophers in the sixties,

257
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,990
you know,
all one,

258
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:44,824
this is,
all this stuff you were talking about 

259
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:47,250
was going down.
Um,

260
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,660
they saw this stuff and they said,
wow,

261
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,890
you know,
okay,

262
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:55,480
power dynamics or the thing,
because I should go back a step.

263
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,323
The postmodern philosophers like food co
and all of this got all hooked up on 

264
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,404
power because they were too satisfied 
with seeing what they called grand 

265
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,070
narratives.
Christianity,

266
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,070
capitalism,
Marxism,

267
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,930
they saw all these huge,
you know,

268
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,720
explanations for how the world works and
said,

269
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:11,770
you know,
they're not working.

270
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,540
Look how bad communism failed.
Look how there's so much bullshit coming

271
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,120
out of this or that from religion.
It's not working,

272
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,790
we need to just get rid of all of it.
We're going to deconstruct this,

273
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,310
we're going to break it down to its 
power dynamics,

274
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,383
and then we're going to look at it in 
terms of who has master hood over over 

275
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,640
who,
who's oppressing what,

276
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,860
whereas dominance and it's just kind of 
grown.

277
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,693
It got picked up in the,
in the academic culture in the 19 

278
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,900
sixties.
That's how old this stuff is,

279
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,093
and then it took this huge turn in the 
19 nineties and get really vicious and 

280
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,290
that's where it really got.
You know,

281
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,890
that's when it turned intersectional 
actually.

282
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,470
That was during the political correct 
days.

283
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,304
That's,
that's when the political correct thing 

284
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,290
kind of blew up.
Yes.

285
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,900
When all this stuff was coming out,
so that would have been late.

286
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:57,400
Nineteen eighties is really when all of 
this political correctness stuff started

287
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,234
coming out at the academy and then a few
years later you see it coming all over 

288
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,460
politics,
which typically what happens,

289
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,313
it starts in the academy.
A few years later it leaks into the 

290
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,530
culture and politics or media or detect 
sector.

291
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,060
Now,
whatever it happens to be,

292
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,350
the stifling of creativity is the most 
disturbing part about it like this,

293
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,910
the agreement that South Park and the 
simpsons are a real problem.

294
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,610
It's so bizarre because here's the 
thing,

295
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,040
if they miss the mark and it's not 
funny,

296
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,730
it won't work and then it'll be a bad 
show and no one would like it,

297
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,683
but if it's funny,
there has to be something about it that 

298
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:34,330
people find ironic,
satirical.

299
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,910
There has to be something about it that 
people are enjoying.

300
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,073
It has to point to some truth and the 
denial of this and instead like to 

301
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:42,191
saying,
oh,

302
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:46,480
it's white males that are causing this 
problem and you shouldn't attack this or

303
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:47,314
that,
or the subjects that are off limits and 

304
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,090
social justice should never be attacked 
like the

305
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,950
to agree to that it.
It's so.

306
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,050
It's so preposterous.
This is life.

307
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,140
We're talking about.
This is literally a nuance of life.

308
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:00,974
All the various strange things in the 
spectrum of human behavior and and all 

309
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:06,884
the things that you encounter in life 
and to segment and limit what is and is 

310
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:15,800
not what's off limits.
It's not off limits based on race,

311
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,520
based on things that a person can't 
control at all.

312
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,040
You're just born white,
so if you're born white,

313
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,670
you're born and oppressor,
you're victimizer,

314
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,504
and if you're a white male,
you're a fucking piece of shit and you 

315
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,800
can say that white,
Hetero male in particular.

316
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,330
Oh God.
I mean,

317
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,164
I've seen so many tweets from people 
that mean so many virtue signaling 

318
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,723
tweets,
but one of my favorite ones is this 

319
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,610
feminist who said,
all white,

320
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,320
a white straight men are trash unless 
proven otherwise.

321
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,370
The thing right?
All of us,

322
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,580
all of us,
50 million of us have been give or take.

323
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,400
You know how many gay folks there are?
Trash,

324
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,720
trash,

325
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,880
no problem.
Proven.

326
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:02,710
It's proven otherwise improve.
You're not right.

327
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,510
How do you do that?
That's a lie.

328
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,850
You have to be an outlaw.
Know where they asked us to problematize

329
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:08,680
allyship too.
You see there's power dynamics.

330
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:09,670
Once you say,
Hey,

331
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,190
I'm an ally,
now you've made it so that you have like

332
00:16:12,191 --> 00:16:13,024
a shield where people can call you a 
white supremacist anymore and you are 

333
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:20,080
acting on behalf of other people in your
speaking for them,

334
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:23,770
so you now have assumed power that we're
reproducing the same power dynamics.

335
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,780
That was my mind comp per paper that 
rewrote my income was about allyship and

336
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:29,130
they were like,
okay,

337
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,070
you didn't prevalent allyship.
Yeah,

338
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,940
we had two of them that did mountain 
comp.

339
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:33,774
One of them we just more or less 
replaced whites would replace Jews with 

340
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:41,620
white men and you literally took mine 
comp.

341
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,563
The actual words from mind calm and put 
it in this paper and replaced the word 

342
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:49,600
Jews with the word white men and they 
accepted it.

343
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,453
Well,
we had two papers that did mind 

344
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,413
comprehend so that one did not get 
accepted with the quotes that you guys 

345
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,084
use.

346
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,630
I mean,
so that one was.

347
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,483
What we did was we took the whole 
document on online and we just searched 

348
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:06,720
the word Jew and we just started picking
sentences and paragraphs.

349
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,410
So what was it that at the end it was 
something like,

350
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,453
if we don't combat whiteness,
it's going to be the funeral wreath for 

351
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:16,700
mankind that's grayed out now.
They didn't.

352
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,210
Yeah,
they didn't.

353
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
They didn't accept that paper though 
because that paper,

354
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,563
uh,
turns out was written from the 

355
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,620
perspective of a white lesbian who hated
her own whiteness.

356
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:26,454
And they said that it was positioning 
her as a good white and because she's 

357
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:29,574
making herself out as a good way again,
allyship isn't all it's cracked up to 

358
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,950
be.
She was making a problem.

359
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:39,030
She should have really been forwarding 
the ideas of the black scholars that she

360
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,790
read way more and not talking about 
herself so much,

361
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,340
even though it was a paper designed to 
be talking about yourself,

362
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:44,760
which

363
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,530
what Hitler did.
So that's what we had to do.

364
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,160
Now the other mind

365
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,640
comp paper was about feminism and what 
we did was he took the chapter,

366
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,860
it's chapter 12.
We took the chapter where he says,

367
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:59,520
this is why we should have the Nazi 
party and what is expected of people who

368
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,460
are going to be part of it.
And we took out our movement,

369
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,333
our party,
he didn't call it a Nazi party in the 

370
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:05,611
chapter,
but everywhere.

371
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,440
He's like our movement.
Took that out,

372
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,274
put in intersectional feminism,
and then modified the words and added 

373
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,390
theory around it so that it would fly 
and theory.

374
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:17,610
That's what they call it.
I love that word theory.

375
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,640
I love when feminist theory,
I love when they throw that around,

376
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,320
like,
what are you saying?

377
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,790
But you're saying things that like once 
you say that you're,

378
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,430
you're good.
Like you've said,

379
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,240
you can say something ridiculous and 
then say feminist theory.

380
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,231
And they're like,
oh,

381
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,430
it's in feminist theory.

382
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,361
Yeah,
that's the thing,

383
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:34,194
right?
Is so much of the stuff they come up 

384
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,120
with.
Let me throw him an olive branch,

385
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,280
like so much of the stuff,
they come up with a creative idea.

386
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,960
Maybe there's something to some of this 
stuff,

387
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:40,794
right?
But what they're putting forward as 

388
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:42,684
hypotheses and then they're treating 
them as conclusions so they're putting 

389
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:47,370
forward this idea.
I saw one on twitter today.

390
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,320
It was something like there's about 
South Park,

391
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,040
how it's been laundering racism into 
society and making everybody comfortable

392
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:53,874
with racism and that's why everything is
so racist and people are shooting Jews 

393
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,594
is because south park made it normal 
that they're treating that as a 

394
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,220
conclusion,
but that's a hypothesis,

395
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,690
right?
So we could test that.

396
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,913
It's conceivable that you could actually
try to parse out what variables need to 

397
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,930
be controlled.
See,

398
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,813
you know,
South Park came out and started doing 

399
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:12,390
these themes.

400
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,100
What,
how does it track?

401
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,650
Statisticians can do kind of amazing 
things with that stuff,

402
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,280
but they're not doing that.
They're not testing it and testing it.

403
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,110
They're concluding it and they're using 
theory to do so and they're going,

404
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,691
no,
no,

405
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,524
no.
It's even bigger than that because why 

406
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:27,421
don't they test it?
Well,

407
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,220
if they tested it,
and this is,

408
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:30,870
I'm not making this shit up,
you won't believe me,

409
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:31,704
but this is true.
If they tested it in the test showed 

410
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,810
that their hypothesis was wrong,
they would say that the test was racist,

411
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,913
but the test is condoning racism and 
that's why it didn't give them the 

412
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:41,850
desired result.
How would you test something,

413
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
because I mean,
I'm not a statistician,

414
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,830
I actually am a mathematician,
but I'm not a statistician.

415
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:47,664
They're two different things,
so I'm not exactly sure how you would 

416
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:52,080
test that,
but conceivably you could gather data,

417
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,780
survey data and see how attitudes have 
changed.

418
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,030
Maybe you could track those kinds of 
articles,

419
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:57,864
kinds of events that are coming out.
You could kind of pair that up with 

420
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:01,584
what's been shown on south park who 
aren't self park and track that with 

421
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,750
attitudes.
There's no effort to do this.

422
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:07,381
They're like,
oh,

423
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:08,214
South Park presents these ideas,
which they then cherry pick because 

424
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,200
there's other ideas that they don't talk
about their point the other direction.

425
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,920
These ideas are problematic.
That's the big word.

426
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,750
Theoretically that's a problem.
Why?

427
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,920
Because they,
and I'm not joking,

428
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:23,610
they literally believed that use of 
language creates the power dynamics that

429
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:24,444
defined society.
So South Park's using language and 

430
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:30,720
imagery that creates a power dynamic 
that makes people more comfortable being

431
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,520
racist.
Boom.

432
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,570
Theory done tests needed.
No even attempt test.

433
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,463
Then if the test happened,
the test itself would be racist unless 

434
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,530
it confirmed the hypothesis.
Right,

435
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,840
so they start with an agenda and then 
you mentioned the word laundry,

436
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,770
which could your former guests,
heather,

437
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,840
talked about a ideal laundry.

438
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,820
I think that's important to the 
listeners.

439
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,880
So what's really what's going on here 
is,

440
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,820
um,
they're forwarding these hypotheses.

441
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,073
They treat,
they don't treat them as hypotheses and 

442
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,750
then they write up a paper paper,
like we were saying is the absolute gold

443
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,990
standard of academic work.
They send the paper off.

444
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,003
The reviewers in our cases,
made our papers crazier every single 

445
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,364
time.
So they push it further into the 

446
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:16,000
ideology or the madness.
How does the review or do something like

447
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:16,660
that?
What,

448
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,730
what input did they get to have?
They said,

449
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:19,564
for example,
that we should problematize allyship if 

450
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,450
we're gonna,
if we want our paper published,

451
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:24,280
we've got to problematize ally Shit.
I love that word.

452
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,680
Problematize everything.
Everything.

453
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,660
Problematize everything.
Dog Parks problem.

454
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,800
The problem with literally anything can 
be problematized and looked at through a

455
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,380
feminist lens.
Does everything.

456
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,273
Every tool.
That's why we called it grievance 

457
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:39,850
studies.

458
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,910
The grievance is they're massively.
Okay.

459
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:43,744
So then,
but the do the Homo transphobia trans 

460
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,433
paper.
So we wrote this paper saying that 

461
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,673
straight men are generally transphobic,
meaning in particular the kind of niche 

462
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:56,404
weird definition that you see on the 
Internet and activist sometimes that 

463
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,960
they aren't interested in having sex 
with trans people who have penises,

464
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,630
trans women who have a penis in 
particular.

465
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,270
And so we said,
well that's the kind of transphobia.

466
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,193
And clearly the reason that they might 
be transphobic is because they don't 

467
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:11,914
practice putting things on their butts.
So if they start putting stuff up their 

468
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,990
butts in particular,
we call it the paper dildos.

469
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,883
So you can imagine what we were saying 
that she put up the paper was called 

470
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:20,650
Dildo.
No,

471
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,060
that was the,
that was the nickname we gave it.

472
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,920
The paper was called going into the back
door.

473
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,150
Really,
really go,

474
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,033
going in through the back door.
There's a lot of technical words that 

475
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:34,990
one get published published.
So we argued that,

476
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,883
that uh,
if straight men just penetrated 

477
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,820
themselves and had their girlfriends 
pegged them through exposure therapy,

478
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:43,654
you know,
you start small and then work your way 

479
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,570
up.
You can remediate transphobia.

480
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,860
Yeah.
Will make them less transphobic.

481
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,060
So as a self penetrating or having your 
girlfriend peg you,

482
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,940
you can be less transphobic and they 
thought this is great.

483
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,060
So we base this off of off of eight 
interviews.

484
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,080
It really 13 interviews,
but with men and I say really a 13.

485
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,750
There were 13 interviews documented,
but five of them were gay people,

486
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,060
not even straight people,
so they don't really apply.

487
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,550
So then we have these eight interviews 
with straight men.

488
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:10,384
We made.
One of them are conservative and he's 

489
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:13,900
just so we could just put in like,
you know,

490
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,150
crazy things that a conservative might 
say about this.

491
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,130
And they were like,
why don't,

492
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,230
why weren't there more conservatives 
participating?

493
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,220
So I was like,
well I'm going to run with this.

494
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,973
I wrote this whole thing.
We invited six conservatives to 

495
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,064
participate and only one accepted.
And to kind of summarize why in the 

496
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:32,560
world,
and this is in the paper,

497
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,830
in the words of one,
I don't want to be a part of some stupid

498
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,930
liberal study about shoving things up 
your butt.

499
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,010
And they published that in.
Oh my God.

500
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,200
So we wrote this

501
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,460
retracted article going in through the 
back door right there.

502
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,880
Oh my God.
Now did they contact you after they were

503
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:56,240
tracked your article and they go,
Hey,

504
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:59,210
you guys are fucking assholes.
You're wasting our time.

505
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:00,044
We spent hours reviewing your papers.
We got a couple of pretty bitter 

506
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,490
responses.
But mostly no.

507
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:05,324
Mostly they've kind of put their head in
the sand and kind of avoided talking to 

508
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:08,204
us that what I was saying before the 
show started that I read one article 

509
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,020
that was really diminishing the impact 
of what you guys have done.

510
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,870
Saying like what?
It's not a big deal.

511
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,513
They were trying to make it seem as if 
what you guys had written was just a 

512
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,500
prank.
That's not what.

513
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,980
That's absolutely false.
Yeah.

514
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,903
There's a lot of papers that seemed like
parody that make it through that you 

515
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:34,280
guys aren't writing.
Oh yeah.

516
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,550
We could pull up one about how hot wings
and like there's a TV show,

517
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,530
spicy ones or something like that.
About hot wings.

518
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,280
Oh yeah,
yeah.

519
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,830
The Youtube show.
Yeah.

520
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,600
So they had a whole one's hot one's.
That's what it was.

521
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:45,640
They had a whole,
uh,

522
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,910
there is a paper out there about that 
show and it's all about how,

523
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,943
you know,
hot sauce has everything to do with 

524
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:52,844
masculinity and being manly and they 
didn't have enough women on the show 

525
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,070
because it's sexist in the hot hot 
sauce,

526
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:01,370
I think was a sexist part and it has all
these bizarre concluded.

527
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:03,650
We cited that in the paper we wrote 
about hooters.

528
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,843
We're putting in the part that 
masculinity contests of eating the hot 

529
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,320
wings who can eat more hot wings and 
then they say,

530
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:10,520
Oh,
I ate 20 hot wings.

531
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,730
Ask out the hooters girl and eating show
hot ones is problematic.

532
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,360
Problematic.
There's an ally,

533
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,130
but that's a real paper,
right?

534
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,590
So we cited that paper.
It's real.

535
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,220
There are thousands of papers like this 
spectacular food,

536
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:31,400
gender and celebrity on hot ones.
And so as a professor,

537
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:33,710
he probably teaches this stuff to 
students,

538
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:34,544
right?
So now everything's problematized and 

539
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:39,290
this is what credentials him.
You get seven in general,

540
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:43,610
you get the says it's a woman.
Years ago she wrote it,

541
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,470
but who's the other one?
Tisha,

542
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,670
at the end who wrote that introduction.
Oh,

543
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:51,320
what's the difference?
There's two people there.

544
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,670
Oh,
it's a commentary.

545
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,010
Is it?
Is it an article about the article?

546
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,690
Yeah,
that's probably what's going on.

547
00:25:56,691 --> 00:26:00,020
His commentary and criticism.
Yeah.

548
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,010
This is.
It looks like.

549
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:02,390
I mean,
I haven't read this specifically,

550
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,520
but wait a minute,
listen to the first statement.

551
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,773
Food media have been recognized as 
cultural artifacts that referenced 

552
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:11,540
culturally and historically specific 
ideals of gender,

553
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,883
drawing on the simultaneously mundane 
and omd food as a medium for 

554
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,594
interrogating,
interrogating ideas about feminism and 

555
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:24,590
identity performance.

556
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,320
What I was telling you,
shut the fuck man.

557
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,040
This is like everything we talked about.
This is such unbelievable horseshit.

558
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,953
No,
this person is teaching at Central 

559
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:35,680
Michigan University.
Yeah.

560
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,040
Yeah.
This is for real.

561
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,480
This is real,
and so there is now a,

562
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,240
an ever expanding group of these folks.
They teach.

563
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,670
Do you want to read more of it as we 
didn't find this and criticism section,

564
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:51,504
the author's introduced a diverse sample
of case studies that demonstrate the 

565
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:59,070
emergence of feminist ideas in and 
through food media.

566
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:00,420
Oh yeah man.
Fuck.

567
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,890
Are you worried about that?
Getting a job,

568
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,070
a real job,
go out there and work,

569
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,160
do something that someone wants to pay 
for something of value,

570
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,120
engagement with hot sauce.
It was so crazy and this is what they're

571
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:18,954
teaching our kids.
Racial assumptions inherent to post 

572
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,150
feminist food culture.
Oh yeah.

573
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:27,000
I was going to write a paper about how 
cornbread is being gentrified and that's

574
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:27,834
why I will never get over racism because
white people are making like pumpkin 

575
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:30,534
spice cornbread.

576
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,643
Just something that I tweeted the other 
day about some what Gad sad tweeted it 

577
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:41,601
and I retweeted it about some.
Some woman was taking back bone broth.

578
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,110
I saw that.
Yeah,

579
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:45,330
it's good.
What in the fuck are you talking about?

580
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,950
People cooking bone broth?
Thousands and thousands of years getting

581
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:53,130
nutrients from the food.
You problematized it.

582
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,550
Look at this.
Queer woman of color wants to decolonize

583
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,220
bone broth.
Stop appropriating my culture.

584
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,590
Gad said he's awesome.
That is so fucking preposterous.

585
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:09,960
A queer woman of color.
So what I'm saying man,

586
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:12,410
there's a thousand papers like this out 
there for everyone.

587
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,420
We wrote a thousand of them that you 
might as well written.

588
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,100
Well,
you couldn't tell if we did or didn't.

589
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,313
That's part of things.
People can't differentiate what we've 

590
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,391
done.
In fact,

591
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:22,224
not only can they not differentiated,
they give us an award so they can't 

592
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:25,434
differentiate it from the stuff that's 
already out there and there's stuff 

593
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:30,060
that's already out there as polluting 
people's minds.

594
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,270
You guys,
you guys,

595
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,240
at least you used to work in academia,
you work in academia.

596
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,470
What is,
how,

597
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,030
how were your peers treating this?

598
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,460
There are.
Well,

599
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,360
Pete has,
is going to have a lot to say about that

600
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:45,710
I think,
but for me,

601
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,590
I've had two from academic people.
I've had two kinds of responses,

602
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,020
but the overwhelming uh,
but some of those are like,

603
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,160
ah,
you guys.

604
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,043
And then the overwhelming of them are 
the same thing over and over and over 

605
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:56,870
again.
And I mean a lot of people.

606
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,180
Thank you so much for doing this,
but I can't,

607
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,420
don't tell anybody.
I'm just trying to get a job.

608
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,400
I'm up for tenure.
I can't talk about.

609
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,220
Thank you.
This needs to go and that's everywhere.

610
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,143
It's everywhere.
You can't proceed through academia now 

611
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,790
unless you bow to this stuff.
Ten years sounds like tyranny.

612
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,110
It did.
The whole thing sounds preposterous.

613
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:19,640
That you can keep a job for life.
Well,

614
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:20,474
the idea was supposed to be that you 
work your ass off for a few years and 

615
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:24,860
then you.
It was supposed to be to defend academic

616
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:25,694
freedom so you get tenure,
then you can go forth and put out some 

617
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:31,550
crazy ideas,
really like dig into some stuff and they

618
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:32,384
can't fire you for coming up with weird 
stuff and then people would argue about 

619
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:37,424
it.
But now it's kind of become the 

620
00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:40,970
situation where people get into this,
they get in their job,

621
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,220
then you can't get rid of them.

622
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,100
Right,
right,

623
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,460
right.
What is there a way to fire people?

624
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,633
Well,
if they do something like sexual 

625
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:52,340
harassment and usually you can find a 
way around the tenure thing.

626
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,683
So what is it like for you now?
You are actually super uncomfortable or 

627
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:01,040
people upset at you?
I'd say they were enraged.

628
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,283
You know what I mean?
The only,

629
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,443
the only thing I can think of,
it's like if you taught at a Christian 

630
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,264
school and then you went in and took 
videos and posting them on youtube of 

631
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,840
suffocating the Bible and then just 
walked into the school.

632
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,550
So I think it's kind of similar in that 
they,

633
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,690
they have bought hook,
line and sinker into microaggressions,

634
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,180
trigger warning,
safe spaces,

635
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,700
diversity and issues there.
There are no,

636
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,060
there's no questioning.
There's a.

637
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,013
and it's something for me that makes me 
deeply uncomfortable when my students 

638
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,060
can ask questions when,
when they,

639
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,523
they can't.
They're just uncomfortable to voice 

640
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:44,111
their opinions about things and I think 
that that peep to say the least.

641
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,740
A lot of people are enraged at me,
but exactly what Jim said.

642
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:49,880
Some people will come in like,
oh,

643
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,170
thank you so much.
Like I know,

644
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,123
but again,
I can't be public about what is the 

645
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,344
ratio.

646
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,803
I mean for me it's like 95 percent 
people who are really happy it happened 

647
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,710
and can't let it be known,
but I'm not,

648
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,390
you know,
facing these people

649
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,450
full everyday.
Well,

650
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,630
you know,
through the videos from evergreen state,

651
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,010
you can see Bret Weinstein's 
interactions with not just students,

652
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:16,700
but also some of the professors that 
were there,

653
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:20,860
there were some of these preposterous 
people that he had to work with that are

654
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,903
buying in Hook,
line and sinker to this stuff and they 

655
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:26,290
live in these insulated world and they 
just,

656
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,393
they,
they create these people that also want 

657
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:31,594
to stay inside these insulated worlds 
and then it just sort of stew in these 

658
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:40,180
ideas and then again go out into the 
real world and they think they're better

659
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,650
people as a result.
Yeah.

660
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,830
So that's a big trick to doing the good 
work because to like question this,

661
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,170
maybe to look at it and say,
ah,

662
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,850
you know,
that kind of looks like bullshit,

663
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:52,610
but I don't know.
A lot of these guys are left leaning.

664
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,444
People are outright leftists.
A lot of them want to do the right 

665
00:31:55,731 --> 00:31:56,564
thing,
right?

666
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,553
They really do.
These people really care about 

667
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:01,330
progressive agendas,
you know,

668
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,550
getting over any lingering 
discrimination that's going on,

669
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:05,480
racism,
sexism,

670
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:07,130
et Cetera.
They really want to do the right thing.

671
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,480
Good for them.
Right.

672
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:09,314
That's what we want,
but they actually have to question or 

673
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,064
like run county,
you think of that like as a river of 

674
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:15,974
morality,
running through them to their mind they 

675
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:20,510
actually have to go upstream a little 
bit and that's hard and it feels weird.

676
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,710
You have to say,
wait a minute,

677
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,783
maybe this scholarship,
maybe this stuff isn't the best way to 

678
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:27,404
do it,
but then the first thought you have as 

679
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,123
well,
these guys are these people in these 

680
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:31,994
disciplines.
Grievance studies are are fighting 

681
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:34,424
racism,
so if I go against them then I'm going 

682
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:36,914
against the people fighting racism,
so maybe I'm helping racism and what we 

683
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,520
keep.
If we get any criticism,

684
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,410
that's what it always is.

685
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,840
Being racists,
you're a tool of the right,

686
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,850
etc.
Etc.

687
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,723
Etc.
You're racist or we are outright 

688
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:50,950
racists.
Outright racist and accusEd of being.

689
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,770
Alright.
If you disagree with any of this stuff,

690
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,400
I get accused of being outright all the 
time.

691
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:01,240
I lean so far left universal healthcare,
universal,

692
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:04,120
basic income,
free school,

693
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,130
I think.
I think education should be free.

694
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:09,310
I think we should paY for,
I believe in a lot of socialist ideas.

695
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:12,640
Totally,
but I'm right wing because I make fun of

696
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,430
people that want to study problemization
of dogs.

697
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:19,090
Fucking really worried.
That's where it is.

698
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,000
If you look at like whether I support 
gay rights,

699
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:22,960
women's rights,
I'm all,

700
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,620
I'm all right.
I'm on board with all that shit.

701
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,830
Take more of my taxes.
I can,

702
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,773
I can.
I can afford to pay more if I really 

703
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:34,930
believed that people are going to get 
real healthcare and real education.

704
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,560
Fucking very happy.
Very happy.

705
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,653
Yup.
if I thought it was all being 

706
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:42,970
appropriated and used correctly.
Fuck yeah.

707
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,650
Let's,
let's make the world a better place.

708
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,530
So that's the thing,
right,

709
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:48,350
is if all this scholarship that they 
were doing on race and gender,

710
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,350
although that's important stuff,
right?

711
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,630
So if they're doing that right,
why wouldn't you want to be behind it?

712
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,640
But they're not doing it right.
HOw do I know?

713
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:56,474
Because I made up papers about dog 
humping and made up the conclusion 

714
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,070
before I wrote the paper and then boom,
they publish it and given an award.

715
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,940
If I can start with the conclusion and 
then work backwards to that conclusion,

716
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:10,430
then I'm not doing rigorous scholarship.
I'm making shit up.

717
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,343
Well also there's no room for dissent 
and there's absolutely zero and in 

718
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:16,674
academia you can't even.
You have to teach whatever the moral 

719
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:19,704
orthodoxy is.
So just imagine this going into 

720
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,870
university.
You're trying to your young mind,

721
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:28,690
you're young kid and I'm deeply 
concerned about these kids are going and

722
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,620
they never hear the other side of an 
issue about immigration.

723
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,010
They never hear the other day so that 
they become brittle over time.

724
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:36,360
So when they hear it,
they just,

725
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,370
they don't know what to do.
They're shocked by it.

726
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,820
Professors are terrified that they'll 
get a complaint.

727
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:43,350
They'll hAve to go to the diversity 
board.

728
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,423
I've been told that I'm not allowed to 
render my opinion about protected 

729
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:48,870
classes when I had that ethics and I 
teach ethics.

730
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:52,380
I don't teach a class or two classes.
I've also.

731
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,600
That's a great question.
Thank you for asking me.

732
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,970
I've asked for a definition of protected
classes,

733
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,730
a list of protected classes.
I didn't receive any.

734
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,460
Uh,
you can be criticized for.

735
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,620
I cannot,
I cannot offer for it.

736
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,071
yeah.
Yeah.

737
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:07,420
I cannot offer under.
Oh no,

738
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:07,670
no,
no,

739
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,503
no,
no.

740
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,740
So yeah,
it was up on a title nine violation.

741
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,574
I'm not,
I'm up for a violation of title nine 

742
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:14,034
violation.
That title nine title nine violation is 

743
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:17,850
serious shit.
I.

744
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,710
Federal discrimination law in 
universities.

745
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,710
Yeah.
What'd you do?

746
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,430
I can't talk about it.
It's okay.

747
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,240
But,
but among the other things that came out

748
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,800
in that meeting where,
uh,

749
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,610
I'm not allowed to render my opinion 
about a protective class.

750
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,880
And so for example,
uh,

751
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,760
I can't,
so I know are covered under a protective

752
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,594
classes.
you can't have an opinion on homosexual 

753
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,200
people.
I can have an opinion,

754
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,360
but I can't.
What if it's a positive opinion?

755
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,433
Well,
so the example that was used in class 

756
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:50,970
was evident.
Evidently I made a comment.

757
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,490
Okay.
So let's take a step back.

758
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,393
Okay.
So this is an ethics class and I was 

759
00:35:56,941 --> 00:36:01,941
talking about how a sexual choice does 
not fall into the realm of morality.

760
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,280
So if,
If a guy's gay and he likes another guy,

761
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:06,114
that's just not a moral thing.
That's just preference or just is what 

762
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:12,150
it is,
like a matter of taste and some,

763
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,043
I don't remember the whole thing,
but someone in someone in the class 

764
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:17,101
said,
well,

765
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:17,934
you know,
you shouldn't have tastes or something 

766
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:20,454
or you shouldn't have,
and I can't remember the exact frame 

767
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,990
because I'm getting this third hand from
the,

768
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,970
from my violation.
You know,

769
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,440
my time came to someone else.
Somebody said in class,

770
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,700
well what about this?
And I,

771
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,950
I made the comment,
I said,

772
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,350
everybody has something.

773
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,183
Everybody has a preference.
Like you can't say that no one had a 

774
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:41,070
preference.
I said,

775
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,680
again,
it would be as if it was,

776
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,420
it would be as if I said,
well,

777
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,343
you know,
I don't want to date someone who's 400 

778
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:48,354
pounds.
So that comment then got turned into 

779
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,244
something when they called somebody else
in the office of diversity inclusion 

780
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:56,844
called someone else in and it was made 
that I was rendering my opinion about 

781
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:00,714
people who were 400 pounds when my.
What I was doing is saying that 

782
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,540
homosexuality itself,
there's no,

783
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,900
there's no reason to give that.
It's just not a moral thing,

784
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,973
but people lump it in,
but the main point of this whole thing 

785
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:14,334
is that we have situations in which 
professors can't talk about protected 

786
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:20,520
classes.
Students are afraid to ask questions.

787
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,330
Everybody's walking on egg shells and 
the students aren't learning and phrases

788
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:25,240
are taken out of context.

789
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,093
Phrases are taking out of context now.
Now if you want a place to go to 

790
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,930
celebrate whatever the raining,
more orthodoxy is in the university is a

791
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:37,200
great place for you.
Did you explain what you meant by saying

792
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,063
that?
You like saying you don't want to date 

793
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:40,764
people over 400 pounds.
Did you explain the context of the use 

794
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:44,334
of.
She wasn't interested in the context of 

795
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,464
it and the trend.
He didn't even say he doesn't want to 

796
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:48,714
date people over 400 pounds.
He said it as exactly as I phrase it as 

797
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,380
a hypothetical.
Right,

798
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,550
so their entire thing,
and if you had said maybe I don't like,

799
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,380
I don't want to date people over seven 
feet tall.

800
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,840
Maybe you could have got away with that.
Yeah.

801
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:06,510
I don't think people over seven feet 
tall or protected class,

802
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,553
you could have got away with that even 
though it's still basically the same 

803
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:09,660
thing.

804
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,493
It's a preference issue.
So I mentioned this to one of my 

805
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:13,550
colleagues and he said to me,
oh you,

806
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,940
that's.
You can't say that.

807
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,470
You should never have said that.
And I said,

808
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:17,010
really?
Why?

809
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,341
He said,
well,

810
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:18,330
you should have said,
well,

811
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,393
we'll,
I don't like dating blue or green 

812
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:21,090
people.
I'm like,

813
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,100
why?
They're they know that they,

814
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,123
they don't even know blue green people 
who is coming to around man and then 

815
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,710
they become a protected class.
Then someone goes back and looks at what

816
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:33,580
you said 10 years ago about blue or 
green.

817
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,070
So that's how I get fired and that's how
that works.

818
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,903
So if you look at all this stuff then 
coming out about victimhood culture and 

819
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,000
how it propagates and how it develops,
and that's one of the things.

820
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:47,240
It's called competitive victimhood.
You could call it additive competitive.

821
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,360
That's the formal term.

822
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,390
People who study this love that 
wonderful people are fighting over who's

823
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,463
a bigger victim.

824
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,460
Did you see it all the time?
It's like you see people in society,

825
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,031
It's like,
oh,

826
00:38:59,031 --> 00:38:59,864
the black lives matter.
People go nuts and then all of a sudden 

827
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,020
the white supremacists are out and 
they're like,

828
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,730
oh,
white people have it hard too.

829
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,740
The second day,
the second somebody hears,

830
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:07,574
oh,
black people have a hard somebodIes got 

831
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,320
to be like white people have it hard 
too.

832
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,000
That's competitive victimhood and so 
then when you have like a moral economy,

833
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:16,280
if you will,
where you can kind of cash in,

834
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,360
gain status or gain access to to 
speaking or whatever it happens to be by

835
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:24,590
holding a certain status of victim hood 
or grievance.

836
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,053
Then you're gonna.
Find people competing to find ways to 

837
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:30,560
get that for themselves.
Everybody's going to go.

838
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,880
I mean you have the infrastructure 
there.

839
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:35,030
Everybody's goIng to go after trying to 
maximize their own utility within that,

840
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,130
so people over seven feet tall aren't a 
protected class yet,

841
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:42,740
but the second they realize that they 
might be able to cash in on it.

842
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,110
They might lobby for it.
Edited victimhood,

843
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:46,600
grievance jockeying.
It's been also,

844
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,543
I've called it grievance jockeying,
I think gets out since you mentioned 

845
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:50,960
him,
called it the oppression olympics.

846
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:51,560
Yep,
yup.

847
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,440
Yeah.
It's wonderful times,

848
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,070
but it really is.
If you look at the root,

849
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,970
so here's the thing that we thought 
about extensively.

850
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:05,090
If you look at the root,
where is this stuff coming from?

851
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,980
All of this stuff is coming from these,
the canons of knowledge,

852
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:10,843
their bodies of literature,
they're peer reviewed and that's the 

853
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:14,920
idea laundering thing.
yeah.

854
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,140
Which was.
So all of that stuff is coming from from

855
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:18,974
this and if you want to make.
If you want to get back to constructive 

856
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,873
politics to get back to people having 
conversations and that's a thing like 

857
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,473
that's.
I think one of the reasons that your 

858
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:28,754
show has been so successful is it's a,
It's a combination of authenticity with 

859
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,940
you can have your totally willing to 
have conversations with no holds barred,

860
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,710
right?
You can't have that in the academy,

861
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,040
so people need to go to you to hear 
these thoughts and to wrestle with ideas

862
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,160
and to engage.

863
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,023
It's just if you can,
you can't really do it anywhere else 

864
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,860
other than a podcast or you can't do it 
in the academy,

865
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,840
but you can't even do it on the today 
show.

866
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,660
They fired meghan carroll for asking why
is blackface racist,

867
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,500
which is a stupid fucking question.
No doubt,

868
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:06,890
and she's not a bright woman and in that
regard,

869
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:10,340
socially very clumsy,
clunky thing to say,

870
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,383
but they just fire a fire.
IT should have what they should have 

871
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,804
done was brought in black scholars and 
black intellectuals for a week just to 

872
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,300
fucking griller.
Exactly,

873
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,380
and that would have been amazing 
television,

874
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,590
but that attItude that you have is not 
what they have.

875
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,660
So they want to punish the transgression
right.

876
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,670
Today.
Well,

877
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,010
I think they just want to stop and

878
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,240
I think they didn't like her anyway,

879
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,363
that's the word is they really didn't 
enjoy her and that she wasn't a nice 

880
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:42,490
person and she was immediate.
It was a learning moment,

881
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:43,324
right?
It was a teaching moment that's lost 

882
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:44,781
now.
Yes,

883
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:45,614
yes,
yes.

884
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,410
but think about it in terms of what we 
were talking about earlier where the.

885
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:51,100
The scholarships stretching back again 
to the sixties,

886
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,173
you have this idea that all of socIety 
is constructed out of power dynamics 

887
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:57,094
that are mediated through language media
imagery and so she just now became 

888
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,793
problematic and she put out ideas that 
would be dangerous and poisonous not to 

889
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:10,270
discuss the merits or demerits of not 
something to work through.

890
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:13,810
Not something as a teachable moment.
She put out an idea that's dangerous.

891
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,730
She can't put out ideas anymore.
Well,

892
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:16,990
you know,
it was really interesting too.

893
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:17,824
She tried.
She was so disingenuous and how she 

894
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,070
approached it is so obvious.
You know,

895
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:21,904
what a black person is it?
Why is it wrong for a black person 

896
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:25,690
dressed as a white person?

897
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,120
It's not.
No one ever said that.

898
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:28,954
Why are you pretending you're just 
setting it up so that you could say a 

899
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:31,770
white

900
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,603
pursing were black,
black face about the other cultural 

901
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:38,580
moment there too.
So like you said,

902
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:40,740
they bring in black scholars and at the 
end of that she said,

903
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:41,574
you know,
I really listened to that and I didn't 

904
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:45,480
know that and I was wrong and I'm 
changing my mind.

905
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,790
There was a woman on twitter that said 
her video,

906
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:49,080
look,
I retweeted it,

907
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:49,914
that it looked like a hostage video.
Anything that was missing was her 

908
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:54,440
holding up a newspaper that showed the 
day,

909
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:57,980
saw that it was australian woman,
go.

910
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,723
The whole thing is so fucking funny,
but that is one of the worst ways to 

911
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,540
really dissect the ideas because first 
of all,

912
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,480
there's the studio audience that fucks 
everything up.

913
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,553
Second of all,
you have these massive time constraints 

914
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,440
and then you have advertisers.
Then you have a bunch of executives that

915
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:19,274
are all cowards.
They're all just ready to pull the 

916
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,374
trigger on anything.
Anytime they can blame you for anything 

917
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:26,120
that went wrong and get rid of you or 
fire you,

918
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:27,440
fire,
fire him,

919
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,880
get rid of them,
get out of him,

920
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,310
bringing the next person you know,
and then they'll,

921
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,780
they'll most likely do is to to show 
they've learned.

922
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,330
They'll hire an all black crew,
right?

923
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,440
For the diverse crew.
That's all a matter of fact.

924
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:45,560
I think I've read it.
Are they doing that?

925
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,790
See,
see if they do that.

926
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,770
They're replacing meghan kelly with a

927
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,080
approve of color.
Make about where that works,

928
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:55,640
right?
It works.

929
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,503
You said they're cowards.
They're afraid they're going to damage 

930
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:58,994
their brand or whatever it is.
Where does that work or who works on 

931
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,121
that?
Bullies,

932
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:03,470
right,
so these people,

933
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,660
why are they so pervasive in the 
academy?

934
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,370
Why are they say pr,
so pervasive and media.

935
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,413
They know they can bully these people.
They know that they can go lean on this 

936
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,354
stuff and somebody is going to be 
cowardly and then they're going to be 

937
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:17,150
able to make something change in the 
direction they want it to change.

938
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,610
You see,
even creeping into politics,

939
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,700
they,
they try to do it with policymakers.

940
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,810
You see it a lot more and a lot of other
countries.

941
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:27,470
Right now we're in this massive backlash
against it in american politics.

942
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,680
How's that going to the 2016?
Your progressive agenda gang.

943
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,833
Holy crap.

944
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,090
Well,
that is a part of the problem with the.

945
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,570
What are they saying?
So yeah,

946
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,430
look at this today.
As you know,

947
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:43,160
we're starting a new chapter in the 
third hour of our show.

948
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:45,170
As it evolves,
it's evolving.

949
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,033
It's a fucking living being.
We want you to know the entire today 

950
00:44:48,591 --> 00:44:49,424
family will continue to bring you in 
formative and important stories just as 

951
00:44:52,911 --> 00:44:56,750
we always have and look to black guys 
and a brown chick

952
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,960
that's 100 percent diverse.
We got rid of the princess.

953
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:03,730
All diverse.
That's the thing.

954
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,420
The way that diversity is defined.
If you had a panel,

955
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:09,460
it was just black guys.
It would be 100 percent diverse.

956
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,390
Yeah.
So they've redefined the word diversity.

957
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:14,580
They need to find the word inclusion.
So,

958
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,020
but to people outside the academy,
they,

959
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:17,970
they think,
oh,

960
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:19,290
diversity,
it's a great thing.

961
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:21,630
Right?
But that's not what it means.

962
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:26,650
It means kind of when everybody has the 
same ideas about something and it's also

963
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,503
when you,
if you're enforcing diversity for what 

964
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,480
we have to,
we would have to find out.

965
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,600
Like ultimately the goal is to find out 
what,

966
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,973
what causes people to succeed and 
especially succeeding in something as 

967
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:45,180
benign as talking.
Right?

968
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:46,860
You're just talking.
That's all you're doing.

969
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,710
So what causes someone to succeed and 
talking.

970
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:50,544
What makes their ideas valuable would 
make some someone you'd enjoy listening 

971
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:57,480
to and then finding like what?
What impediments?

972
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:58,314
There are two that in all the various 
communities and fix it at the root 

973
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,950
level.
What doesn't work is saying,

974
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:05,843
we need one chinese lady,
we need one black guy and we need one 

975
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:12,090
white guy.
Because if you do something like that,

976
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:14,460
you're not going to get the best show.
Nope,

977
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,640
you're not going to get the best.

978
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,753
Well,
you're not even guaranteed to achieve 

979
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:18,920
the goal you're claiming.
So it's,

980
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:19,754
again,
it goes back to theory in theory and 

981
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,753
theory in terms of postmodern critical 
theory that this stuff's all based on 

982
00:46:25,071 --> 00:46:25,904
that we studied.
The idea is that if you have a 

983
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:28,844
particular identity now you have a 
particular view of the world and people 

984
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:32,684
have other identities have different 
ones and in fact there's this whole 

985
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:36,224
thing called standpoint epistemology 
that says that if you have a 

986
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:39,194
marginalized identity,
you know more about the world and other 

987
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:43,160
people because you live in two worlds at
once.

988
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,320
So the the idea is,
oh,

989
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:48,020
if we get a black guy in here,
he's had a different life experience,

990
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:52,280
therefore he can speak truly to that.
If you get a chinese lady in here,

991
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:53,930
she can speak to that.
So on and so Forth.

992
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,180
So the guests is that by virtue merely 
of bringing in people who look different

993
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,980
with different races or genders or 
sexist or sexualities,

994
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:08,660
then you automatically get a diverse set
of opinions,

995
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,930
but that doesn't work.
That's not how that actually works.

996
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:12,764
You could take people of every race,
educate them on the exact same social 

997
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:17,930
justice curriculum and they all think 
exactly the same thing,

998
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,630
but at least in something like hosting 
the today show you are just talking once

999
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:26,790
you put these sort of diversity 
standards or something like mathematics.

1000
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,650
No.
yeah,

1001
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,190
that's.
That's when things get super.

1002
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:30,040
And so

1003
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,530
they're trying to do that a little bit 
tweeted that thing.

1004
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:36,850
I wroTe about the mathematics and they 
wanted people to sign an equity,

1005
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:39,200
which is another word that they've 
cooperated.

1006
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,640
They wanted folks to sign an equity 
statement and a diversity statement,

1007
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:43,570
and the thing is,
explain,

1008
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,310
explain what they're trying to.
That you,

1009
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,930
you,
you have a commitment to diversity.

1010
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:48,764
Yeah.
You have a commItment to diversity and 

1011
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:50,854
you have a commitment to equity.
And so equity does not mean treating 

1012
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:55,504
people equally.
It's not like you have a commitment to 

1013
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,940
equality,
which is what we should all have a short

1014
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,280
material quality.
Uh,

1015
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,503
it's equity is defined differently.
It's to make up for past injustices are 

1016
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:12,631
to make up for some deficiency that has 
occurred somewhere along the line.

1017
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:15,364
So yeah,
affirmative action is an equity 

1018
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:17,404
movement.
It's to treat people differently in 

1019
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:20,290
order to level the playing field.

1020
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,200
Yeah.
So it's not treating people,

1021
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,970
it's not treating people equally.
And that's the key thing.

1022
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,710
It sounds like it is,
but it's not.

1023
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,430
It's a word that they've smuggled in 
straight out of the literature.

1024
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:31,121
Again,
it's again,

1025
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:32,980
out of all the stuff comes back to the 
literature.

1026
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,740
So if you look at the word equity in the
dictionary,

1027
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,113
you get one definition.
But if you look at the word equIty as 

1028
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:42,670
they're applying it and sociological 
definitions,

1029
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,563
it's a very specific thing that means 
something slightly different from what 

1030
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,040
people assume.
So here's the question.

1031
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:48,874
You should ask somebody.
Anytime you hear someone use the word 

1032
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:52,330
equity,
just ask.

1033
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:52,900
Oh,
I'm.

1034
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,090
I'm curious,
why didn't you use the word equality?

1035
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,380
Can,
can you.

1036
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,213
Can you think of it?
Would the sentence be the same with the 

1037
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:00,400
meeting?
Be the same?

1038
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,540
Well,
the meaning is not the same.

1039
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,670
That's why they used equity and not 
equality.

1040
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,250
Equity is a finance word.
That's why it's weird.

1041
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,040
He's also fun.
So they don't make up new words,

1042
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,110
right?
They go,

1043
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,320
yeah,
they call up,

1044
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,530
they change and then they smuggled 
diversity inclusion,

1045
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,310
these academic papers and they come up 
with these ideas.

1046
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:20,260
They start with their conclusion,
they push it through,

1047
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:21,094
it gets published and that's just like.
It's like the academic equivalent of 

1048
00:49:23,891 --> 00:49:27,130
money laundering.
Money laundering work.

1049
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,450
Yes.
You take some money,

1050
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:29,460
you got,
you know,

1051
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,610
ill gotten money,
you put it through this shell company or

1052
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:35,920
this thing or the other thing and it 
comes back to you.

1053
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:38,350
And now it's had illegal trail that 
makes it legit.

1054
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:40,360
Right?
Well here you take some prejudice.

1055
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,270
You write it down as an academic paper.
You published the thing,

1056
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,550
it gets the academic standard stamp on 
it.

1057
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,280
It's the gold standard of knowledge now 
and now.

1058
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:51,280
This is this prejudice you started with 
now looks like legitimate knowledge that

1059
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:52,450
can go straight in the classroom.

1060
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,360
It can go straight to exactly.
Activists or policymakers.

1061
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,920
It's a real problem.
Yeah.

1062
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:57,754
And then really funny though that you 
get it is that's bret weinstein said 

1063
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:08,020
that weinstein said that and that's what
it comes out.

1064
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:08,854
The other side is knowledge.
So then they think they have knowledge 

1065
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,003
or paper about the dildos.
The guy said this paper is an important 

1066
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:19,390
contribution to knowledge.
Who is it that the reviewer one?

1067
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,770
I think out of the viewer,
what?

1068
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,400
Who the fuck are you Important 
contribution to knowledge.

1069
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,010
I would hope reviewer one was just 
hitting a bong right

1070
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,600
before big data was laughing,
laughing at the whole college.

1071
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,273
What kind of person gets attracted to 
whole heartedly agreeing to these 

1072
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,480
ridiculous ideas?
Like what?

1073
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,180
What are the people like to gray 
question.

1074
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,770
I think it's people who want to save the
world.

1075
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,030
Well,
we,

1076
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,770
I think we would all like to save the 
world.

1077
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,450
Yeah.
I'm much more cynical than they.

1078
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:55,470
Yeah,
they've got to know they've got,

1079
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,823
they've got this idea that,
I mean we talked a moment ago about 

1080
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,640
about privilege and we kind of brushed 
real close to the idea that it fits kind

1081
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:05,474
of like original sin.
And so they see that the downside of 

1082
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:10,710
privilege,
the opposIte side,

1083
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,460
discrimination or racism,
sexism,

1084
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:14,230
et cetera.
Hate is the big word.

1085
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:16,400
You know,
fight hate or he's he,

1086
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:18,640
he's using hate.
This is hate speech.

1087
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:22,330
That's where I think they got the term 
that's like the evil thing.

1088
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,640
You're born with privilege.
That's like original sin.

1089
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,990
So what do they want to do?
They want,

1090
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,280
they want to fIx the save the world by 
clearing out the evil of privilege,

1091
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,280
by clearing out hate from the world.
For them.

1092
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:34,114
Utopia means nobody hates.
And by hate we mean something like 

1093
00:51:36,671 --> 00:51:37,650
racism,
sexism,

1094
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:38,583
etc.

1095
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,453
So it's a noble idea,
but then when you start looking at it 

1096
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:43,294
and it's ridiculous way,
like you're born with privilege and now 

1097
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:46,660
you're just stuck with it,
right?

1098
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,400
What can you do?
It's original sin.

1099
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,263
You can be sorry for it.
You can try to be an ally and work it 

1100
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:52,240
off.
You can check it.

1101
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,730
Whatever the hell that means.
You can do a lot of things,

1102
00:51:54,731 --> 00:51:57,580
but you can't actually atone for it.
You can't get over it.

1103
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,414
You can't get rid of it.
Then you get this situation where it's 

1104
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:04,840
like they really,
really need to take desperate measures.

1105
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:06,130
Like,
let's lock it all down.

1106
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:06,964
Let's,
let's tell these people that they're 

1107
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:08,854
wrong.
Let's try to point out how white 

1108
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,400
supremacy is in them because they're 
white.

1109
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,300
LeT's point out how masculinity is an 
ideology that needs to be destroyed.

1110
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,490
That was Lisa Wade.
She wrote that last year.

1111
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,870
That is an ideology that needs to be 
destroyed.

1112
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,780
Yeah.
It needs to be masculine because trump,

1113
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,040
and this is the thing,
right?

1114
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,530
I think in the past couple of years,
of course,

1115
00:52:28,531 --> 00:52:29,690
before trump,
it wasn't new.

1116
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,653
They had other avatars.
I think there's a lot of anger and 

1117
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:33,174
frustration,
justifiably slow at trump and they see 

1118
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:37,610
this and so I read so many other,
usually op-eds,

1119
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,130
not their academic pieces and it's like 
men are like this,

1120
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:41,771
men are blah,
blah,

1121
00:52:41,771 --> 00:52:42,604
blah,
and you can tell they're just talking 

1122
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:44,370
about trump,
but they can't touch him.

1123
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,560
So they're pissed off and they tried to 
take it out on all men.

1124
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,590
I think that's like a huge thing.
They see these problems,

1125
00:52:49,591 --> 00:52:50,424
they exaggerate the problems.
They practIce problematizing and that's 

1126
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:53,334
a thing,
rIght?

1127
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,710
They practice this stuff.
You go to school,

1128
00:52:55,711 --> 00:52:58,530
it's in the general ed curriculum.
Maybe they major in this stuff.

1129
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,820
You get good at fInding problems.
I was just talking yesterday.

1130
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,500
came over.
I never actually,

1131
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:05,880
I got to los angeles a couple of times 
before,

1132
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:08,220
but I've never been to the beach.
I never actually made it down,

1133
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:09,054
so I went down to santa monica,
go to one of these burger places right 

1134
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,654
on the,
on the right by the pier and it says 

1135
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,623
that this is the burger that made santa 
monica famous and immediately you saw 

1136
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:20,010
the hot ones thing.
right?

1137
00:53:20,011 --> 00:53:21,240
I was like,
there's a paper on this,

1138
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,533
you see the problems here.
You have this manly double being 

1139
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,410
marketed.
That's what made santa monica famous.

1140
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,333
Oh,
so maInly food culture is the kind of 

1141
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:35,610
like colonialism that goes and makes a 
city become a city.

1142
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,890
It makes a place into a place.
And you could.

1143
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,750
I could write a paper about that in 
three days.

1144
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,960
Do you have to have credentials to write
a paper,

1145
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:42,850
a phd?

1146
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,010
No,
technically not.

1147
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:47,730
And that's a sad thing because what 
their response to this has been,

1148
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:48,564
oh,
we're going to screen better to see who 

1149
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,500
is actually writing these papers so they
can't trick us,

1150
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,780
but that's bullshit.
So we trick you.

1151
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:55,763
The point is that the scholarship is 
that it should stand on its merits of 

1152
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:58,783
the arguments solid if the research is 
good and they thought our research was 

1153
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,140
good.
So my point about the dog humping thing,

1154
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,453
it should leave it the way it is.
If they're saying that this is such an 

1155
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,450
important piece.
Right.

1156
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:10,284
Well,
I mean I would walk back on that one 

1157
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:15,510
because we did make up the data and 
falsifying data is not cool.

1158
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,740
Well,
what data would be incorrect?

1159
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:20,130
Like what?
We didn't even go to the dog park.

1160
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,810
We definitely didn't ask anybody about 
their dogs or their genitals or anything

1161
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:27,240
that you could have similar results.

1162
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,350
We said that there's a dog crapping on 
another dog's head in the paper and like

1163
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,140
that didn't happen.
I'm sure that didn't happen and maybe it

1164
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,900
did happen though.
I mean this is insane,

1165
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,580
but we had other papers that didn't do 
that.

1166
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,190
Fat bodybuilding didn't do that.
The one that's the one that joke's on.

1167
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:42,024
You didn't do that.
There was no made up data and most of 

1168
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:47,190
our papers.
And why shouldn't those stand?

1169
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,690
Right.
Why should they stand by those?

1170
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:49,524
Exactly.
I can get it because we can't 

1171
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:51,534
differentiate real scholarship from 
bullshit because they're in this crazy 

1172
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,074
eco system in which their ability to 
make discerning judgments about things 

1173
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:02,190
has been dulled because they put an 
agenda before the truth.

1174
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,083
I keep seeing all these academics coming
like they get their got you moment on 

1175
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:05,580
us.
They're like,

1176
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,570
oh,
I read your paper.

1177
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,740
It's actually a real paper.

1178
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,431
It's good.
Yeah.

1179
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:10,140
How crazy is like,
yeah,

1180
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,450
thanks For noticing.
You know,

1181
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,293
asshole.
That's exactly what we were trying to 

1182
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:16,050
do.
We weren't writing just stupid pranks.

1183
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:16,884
The dog park papers pretty funny,
but we were actually trying to learn 

1184
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:19,944
what's going on there.
Thanks for noticing somebody finally 

1185
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:23,700
did,
but that means of course they don't want

1186
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:24,534
to admit that we actually learn this 
stuff because then when we say it's 

1187
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,323
shit,
they're stuck with somebody who knows 

1188
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:31,320
what they're talking about saying it 
sucks and they don't want that either.

1189
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,103
No.
When you said these people that are 

1190
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,720
trying to save the world,
like what?

1191
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,003
What do you really mean by that?
I think there are the people who are 

1192
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:42,330
trying to build the kingdom of god on 
the planet earth.

1193
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,090
You know,
to draw a metaphor,

1194
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,933
religious metaphor.
There are people who see an eVil and 

1195
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:49,470
they want to purge the world of that 
evil by any means necessary,

1196
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,640
and the evil being like privilege,
privilege,

1197
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,770
privilege and white supremacy,
new religions,

1198
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,380
patriarch.
Christianity goes down.

1199
00:55:58,381 --> 00:55:59,214
It's just a game of thrones is the onlY 
reason you need new gods are because 

1200
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:03,204
people don't believe in the old gods and
so we have these religious modules or 

1201
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:11,271
what have you in our brain and the new 
religion is intersectionality and we see

1202
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:16,230
really is what it is exactly what it is.
You know the parallels are wrIting about

1203
00:56:16,231 --> 00:56:17,064
that and talking about that for years 
studyIng religion psychology for years 

1204
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,710
and it's.
It's all over the listening is political

1205
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,460
correctness

1206
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,080
is paralleled with blast.
For me,

1207
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,020
it's the same parallels of harrison the 
apparels.

1208
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,280
That's exactly right.
I mean it's,

1209
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,643
it's so stunning how easily people sort 
of slide into these preconditioned 

1210
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:38,650
slots.
Huge.

1211
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:42,280
The one difference,
and I think this is a key difference,

1212
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,080
the reason that it's easier,
and I mentioned this to pendulum when we

1213
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:48,760
did a talk and he just couldn't believe 
it.

1214
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:53,080
The reason that it's easier to talk to 
christian for example,

1215
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:53,914
about faith or about their religion is 
because at the end of the day it comes 

1216
00:56:57,161 --> 00:57:00,460
down to faith.
These people don't have any faith.

1217
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,380
They have knowledge,
quote unquote.

1218
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:06,430
They have their bodies of scholarly 
literature which are ideal honored.

1219
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:07,683
That's what they have,
so they can point to these things and 

1220
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,361
say,
well,

1221
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:11,570
I don't have any.
I know.

1222
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,490
I know.
How do you know?

1223
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,590
Well,
robin deangelo's,

1224
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,160
white fragility.
How'd you study?

1225
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:15,890
There's a study.
Yeah,

1226
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,200
there's a study.
There's a study,

1227
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,760
there's a study.
I know household stuff.

1228
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:19,594
Some of those studies are written and 
trust them and you shouldn't trust them 

1229
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:24,210
either.
Yeah.

1230
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:28,270
Well you see that even in nutrition when
you see it in everything this,

1231
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,860
this in in terms of like almost a 
religious or religion,

1232
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:34,600
like accepting.
Exactly.

1233
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:38,800
Have specific ways of eating or specific
ways of communicating,

1234
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:39,634
specific ways of being.
It's just so strange how people seem to 

1235
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:49,350
have this natural inclination to adopt 
predetermined patterns of behavior.

1236
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:49,820
Right?

1237
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,653
Yeah.
I think actually there's pretty decent 

1238
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,860
understanding of that from from the 
perspective of moral psychology.

1239
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,083
You've got this idea that somebody has 
has seen something as good so it 

1240
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:00,440
elevates them.
It makes them better,

1241
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:02,750
so clean eating might be good,
right?

1242
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:04,670
Whatever clean eating means.
For some people it's vegan.

1243
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,370
For some people it's like all you eat is
grass fed beef,

1244
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:08,263
who knows,
but you've got clean eating and you've 

1245
00:58:10,011 --> 00:58:10,844
got dirty eating and he'd go into the 
clean thing and so you've got this kind 

1246
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:13,684
of like purity thing and eventually you 
take this so seriously that it becomes 

1247
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,350
kind of a sacred value to you.
Well,

1248
00:58:18,351 --> 00:58:19,740
what's sacred mean?
You know,

1249
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,530
we have this kind oF vague sense,
oh,

1250
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,000
you know,
holy this,

1251
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:23,834
that,
that's sacred and it's something really 

1252
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:26,174
important to somebody.
Or what it really means is that it's 

1253
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:28,364
taken on so much moral important to 
somebody that they no longer will allow 

1254
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:33,140
it to be questioned when something 
sacred.

1255
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,690
It's now been removed from the sphere of
being doubted,

1256
00:58:35,691 --> 00:58:36,524
questioned or whatever.
And so when you have this idea of Like 

1257
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,130
that,
um,

1258
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,810
let's say that that privilege is the 
cause of,

1259
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,400
of racism,
and you've elevated that are the problem

1260
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,234
with everything in society,
even then you've elevated that to a 

1261
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:52,724
sacred value that can't be questioned.
You can't say maybe there's another 

1262
00:58:55,971 --> 00:58:56,804
dimension to it.
That's when you start getting these 

1263
00:58:58,611 --> 00:59:00,530
kinds of religious like behaviors.
You start getting these,

1264
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,360
these problems because you've got a 
place where it can't be a question.

1265
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,233
Be made fun of.
If we're talking about the comedy 

1266
00:59:06,621 --> 00:59:08,090
earlier,
this is killing comedy,

1267
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:09,403
right?
It's absolutely killing comedy because 

1268
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:13,190
you can't make a joke because if the 
joke goes a little bit wrong,

1269
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,620
now you're.
You've committed a heresy,

1270
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,750
you're a blasphemer,
they're going to be yes,

1271
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,593
but no,
because people love when you go against 

1272
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:22,190
it.
That's

1273
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,070
true.
So the weight of it is there,

1274
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:28,410
but when you resist it,
people scream and throw.

1275
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:28,911
YeS,
yes,

1276
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:30,860
yes.
So this is really interesting because if

1277
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:33,470
we take their theory about humor at face
value,

1278
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:34,304
right?
That you can only go against a power 

1279
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:36,591
thing.
So we say,

1280
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:37,310
okay,
you know what?

1281
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,480
We wrote a paper,
one of our papers,

1282
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:40,970
the joke's on you was about that.
Let's say the right.

1283
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,920
Why do people love it?
Well,

1284
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:45,140
it's because everybody knows these guys,
these guys have power.

1285
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,270
They're trying to pretend that they 
don't have power,

1286
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:49,130
that they are the victims.
They're the oppressed.

1287
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,353
Meanwhile,
they're bullying everybody and 

1288
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:51,983
everything.
They're firing people for saying the 

1289
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:54,900
wrong thing in class.
You know,

1290
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:55,783
whatever it is,
that's only possible if they have power 

1291
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,140
in the joke when south park makes fun of
like,

1292
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:00,771
what was it,
pc,

1293
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:01,640
principal or whatever.

1294
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,653
When south park makes fun of that.
The only reason people laugh if their 

1295
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:06,980
theory is right is because they're 
powerful.

1296
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,280
If their theory's wrong because it's 
just funny.

1297
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,480
Then we can talk about something 
different,

1298
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:14,390
but if they're actually right,
if they're actually making a point here,

1299
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:18,860
they're not recognizing that they're 
admitting that they have seized a lot of

1300
01:00:18,861 --> 01:00:19,694
cultural power and that's why people 
celebrate when you go back against 

1301
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:23,954
stuff.
That's why people have sent us some 

1302
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:26,330
emails,
like this is the greatest thing ever.

1303
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:27,613
Thank you so much for doing this.
There's all this shit like you guys are 

1304
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:30,231
heroes,
blah,

1305
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:31,160
blah blah.
Why?

1306
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,080
Because they wanted to see you laughed.
Why?

1307
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:35,540
Because it was funny.
As hell as why and why?

1308
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:36,374
Because these people are there.
They're influencing the shit out of 

1309
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:39,770
stuff.
Yeah,

1310
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,290
and if they weren't,
if they were just,

1311
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,060
you know,
victims who don't have a voice,

1312
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:47,000
who can't make any impact,
who aren't bullying people.

1313
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,070
Every room you're like,
why are you bullying those guys?

1314
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,960
Why are you being a dick?
Right,

1315
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:54,980
but everybody thinks it's funny and why?
Because because they have real impact.

1316
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:56,660
They haven't had a real impact.
Yeah,

1317
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:57,494
and that's one of the things that we 
really want to convey to people is that 

1318
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:02,840
this happens in the academy,
does not stay in the academy.

1319
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:03,680
No,
it's spread.

1320
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,950
It's spread throughout the world now and
I've,

1321
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,860
I've read some articles about some 
things that we've said on this show that

1322
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:10,694
are just fucking completely preposterous
and taken totally out of context and 

1323
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:17,300
presented as some evidence of,
you know,

1324
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:21,800
whatever transgression that's impossible
to defend.

1325
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,490
It's very strange.
It's very strange time for,

1326
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:29,210
for communication.
It's a very strange time for ideas now,

1327
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,133
but I also think it's really exciting.
It's exciting that all this nonsense is 

1328
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:34,700
going on.
That's one of the things that are really

1329
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:35,870
loved about what you guys have done.

1330
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:36,703
It's exciting.
It's exciting that you guys have 

1331
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,580
infiltrated and had these fucking 
dummies public.

1332
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:45,860
Not just publish your shit,
but praise it.

1333
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,890
Yeah.
I'd say how amazing it is that you wrote

1334
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:49,724
a bit about fat bodybuilding acceptance 
is this one fat shaming and fat 

1335
01:01:58,011 --> 01:02:01,130
acceptance too.
Preposterous phrases.

1336
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,690
There really are.
You know,

1337
01:02:02,691 --> 01:02:05,660
I mean you shouldn't be mean to people.
That's it,

1338
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,600
but fat shaming because someone's fat.
No,

1339
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,650
you can't call me fat because I'm not.
Fat doesn't work.

1340
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,260
So that's real similar.
So that body of literature.

1341
01:02:15,261 --> 01:02:16,094
Here's something that I learned when I.
I read this is they don't use the word 

1342
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:24,660
obesity because this is really 
interesting because obesity,

1343
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,450
it gets back to what jim was saying.
Obesity is a narrative.

1344
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,120
It's just a story.
So they use the word fat.

1345
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,550
Excuse me.
So there's not obesity,

1346
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:33,384
bodybuilding,
there's fat bodybuilding and there are 

1347
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:35,274
all these narratives,
so why would one want to buy into one 

1348
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:41,940
narrative rather than another narrative?

1349
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:42,803
Why iS fat and obesity?
Because obesity is a medicalized 

1350
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:49,650
narrative where fat is just a 
description.

1351
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,710
They're rejecting medicalized terms.
Well,

1352
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,230
they call it a health system.
I'm not making that up.

1353
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:56,803
Health is a narrative.
It's a power structure were healthy and 

1354
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,133
thin.
People are imposing their view of how 

1355
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:07,790
bodies should be on an unhealthy,
been privileged,

1356
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:11,580
like they'd look at you and you've got 
all the [inaudible] your muscular too,

1357
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:13,800
so you wouldn't just be straight white,
heterosexual,

1358
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:14,960
cis,
etc.

1359
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:15,803
I mean you've got health privilege and 
you've got health privilege and 

1360
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,490
privilege.
Probably thin privilege also enable us.

1361
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:25,170
You're really,
you're really stuck.

1362
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:27,000
Good for you.
Falls into that.

1363
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:29,290
So I'm privileged.
That's real.

1364
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,320
That's a real one that they use and they
also claim to be a healthy at every size

1365
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:35,154
movement.
You can be healthy at every size and 

1366
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:38,460
obesity is just a medicalized 
narratives.

1367
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:39,294
Yeah,
and that's really important though 

1368
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:40,434
because the point of that is to say if 
your doctor tells you you're fat and 

1369
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:46,650
it's a health concern,
then you don't have to listen.

1370
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:48,850
Yeah,
that is the.

1371
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,753
I've read that before and they're read 
an article by this woman who was 

1372
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,660
morbidly obese.
Charlotte cooper.

1373
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,730
I don't use the mail order,

1374
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,373
but she was talking.
She was also using really misusing some 

1375
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:04,550
studies on.
There was some there.

1376
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,393
There.
There have been some studies on people 

1377
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:07,844
who are overweight and that there could 
possibly be some health benefits to 

1378
01:04:13,581 --> 01:04:17,300
being overweight.
These studies had been widely dismissed.

1379
01:04:17,301 --> 01:04:18,134
Now not only dismissed,
but they go in direct contrast to the 

1380
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:22,424
great volume of studies that show how 
terrible it is for your health to be 

1381
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,850
that,
that fat and that heavy,

1382
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:32,630
but this person,
I don't remember who it was,

1383
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:37,340
why she was doing this,
but she was clinging to these one or two

1384
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:42,140
studies that have been dismissed.
These are biased epidemiological studies

1385
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,183
that have been dismissed,
but she was put putting them in this 

1386
01:04:44,661 --> 01:04:45,494
blog as if this is some sort of evidence
that not only is it not unhealthy to be 

1387
01:04:51,531 --> 01:04:52,364
fat,
but it might be healthy to be fast and 

1388
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:54,954
I'll think about this person in an 
academic position as a professor 

1389
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,560
teaching young people to protect 
particularly young girls,

1390
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,360
particularly young girls who have eating
disorders.

1391
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,810
Exactly.
Health a white privilege.

1392
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:08,500
Oh my god,
is this real?

1393
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,820
This is a real paper is definitely.
Oh man,

1394
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,263
they think it's a.
I think it's like when the doctor says 

1395
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:16,990
you're overweight,
it's a concern for your health.

1396
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,010
See that as a form

1397
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,250
of fat shaming saying that they're not 
all right the way that they are.

1398
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,960
They're not Being accepted the way that 
they are.

1399
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:23,943
There was a power dynamic that healthy 
people are imposing upon overweight 

1400
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:27,184
people.
they have myriad issues that they come 

1401
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:29,734
up with and I mean insurance.
Some of these complaints have got to be 

1402
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:33,010
somewhat real.
You know,

1403
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,490
they don't make as many oversized 
clothes plus sized clothes.

1404
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:39,820
It's harder to get styles or there's 
some legit stuff you know,

1405
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:41,110
that they might want to say,
hey,

1406
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:44,710
what can we do something about this?
But on the other hand,

1407
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,190
the whole thing that like saying that it
has nothing to do with health,

1408
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:50,920
it has nothing to do with your 
triglyceride levels.

1409
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:57,010
It runs it's anti evidence.
It runs in tHe face of every conceivable

1410
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:59,320
piece of evidence.
There are teaching kids this,

1411
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:01,420
they're in schools and there are 
classes,

1412
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,900
fat studies classes,
and there was an actual,

1413
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,210
whoa,
whoa,

1414
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:04,750
whoa,
whoa.

1415
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:09,280
There's fat studies journal publIshed 
the fed fat studies.

1416
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,210
Jamie's going to bring it up.

1417
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,860
I told you,
I told you 30 million people are waiting

1418
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:19,861
to find out real journal of body weight 
and this is what jim was telling me.

1419
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:22,390
He's like,
when when we do this,

1420
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,260
30 million people are going to now know 
that there's something fat.

1421
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,940
Now fat studies doesn't do what you 
think it does.

1422
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,110
You probably think,
oh,

1423
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,070
fat studies,
you know what?

1424
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:32,080
A triglycerides,
how much should you exercise?

1425
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,840
Good diet.
How much sugar is too much sugar?

1426
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,390
Well,
that is aBsolutely not what this journal

1427
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:39,940
does.
Frozen a fat tail of immigration.

1428
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:42,700
What the hell?
Rafting weight stigma.

1429
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,593
Hold on a second.
Crafting weight stigma in swimming 

1430
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:49,360
classes.
A case study in Ireland,

1431
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,141
so,
so I'm tellIng you,

1432
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:52,450
you go to a swimming class,
you're going to go lose weight.

1433
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:54,250
You take a take a fitness class or 
something.

1434
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:55,084
Whatever slimming classes are fatness in
temporary use a stigma against being 

1435
01:06:58,331 --> 01:06:58,570
fat.

1436
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,490
They they basically say fats bad for 
you.

1437
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,490
This one,
theorizing,

1438
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,333
fat oppression,
intersectional approaches and 

1439
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:10,300
methodological innovations.
You just said a bunch of nonsense.

1440
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:11,134
The oppression of fat people as built 
into institutions pervades the cultural 

1441
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:15,100
landscape in effect.
Dude,

1442
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:15,934
we could have written this and affects 
the relationship and perceptions of 

1443
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:19,390
people of size,
people of size.

1444
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,530
Is this introduction to the special 
issue on flip size?

1445
01:07:22,531 --> 01:07:23,364
It's not the new people of color.
More people of color is a problem now 

1446
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:30,930
to.
Yes you can,

1447
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,940
but you see there's people of color and 
then there's bi poc,

1448
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:35,430
which I don't know how you pronounce it 
off,

1449
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,700
it's bipap or what,
but uh,

1450
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,553
that would be black and indigenous 
people of color because they have even 

1451
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:42,430
more oppression than the other people of
color.

1452
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:45,140
And they got a fight and yellow people 
of color.

1453
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,090
Yeah.
For example,

1454
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:47,670
or probably brown.

1455
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:50,590
Harvard can discriminate against asians 
that are trying to get in,

1456
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,570
let's tap our noses and just move on.
Right?

1457
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,570
So,
so,

1458
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,413
but then that's even a problem because 
indigenous has recent recently been 

1459
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,540
branded a racist term because you're not
actually honoring.

1460
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,403
Yeah.
You're not hitting the actual tribal 

1461
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,040
identity if you get right on the cutting
edge of this stuff.

1462
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:10,900
It's like really going into meltdown 
closeness is because it's too random.

1463
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:11,231
Well,
yeah,

1464
01:08:11,231 --> 01:08:12,040
you're just.
You're not.

1465
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,500
You're generalizing your chair.
What exactly?

1466
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,000
Nez perce.
Yeah.

1467
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,920
Okay.
So you can see again,

1468
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:23,050
the competitive victimhood going on who 
gets to claim more of the victimhood pie

1469
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:25,520
and oh now we've got this thing about 
people of color.

1470
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:26,670
so they get,
you know,

1471
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:29,360
victimhood status,
but why?

1472
01:08:29,361 --> 01:08:31,280
If that goes to all people of color 
equally,

1473
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,114
that's not fair because these people of 
color even more dIscriminating it so 

1474
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:35,120
they should get more of it.

1475
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,253
It's really,
they're fighting over a piece of a pie 

1476
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,533
of victim hood nus.
I love the canadian term first nations 

1477
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,340
first nation people.
It's,

1478
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,243
it's a better term because really 
fucking every single human being that 

1479
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:53,360
came to north America came from 
somewhere else.

1480
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:56,400
So it's just being a witch in the.
In the fap,

1481
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,400
since we're talking about in the fat 
bodybuilding paper.

1482
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,263
Oh yeah.
I put in a star trek reference at the 

1483
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,393
end.
I love star trek.

1484
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:05,630
I put in something like fat bodybuilding
is the final frontier for fat activism.

1485
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,820
Oh,
they didn't like to go.

1486
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:07,663
They didn't like that they said it was 
so that we couldn't use the word 

1487
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:14,861
frontier because it evokes imagery of 
the genocides America,

1488
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:18,020
the american native americans,
to choose a different word.

1489
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:19,503
yeah.
Yeah.

1490
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,220
You're holy shit.
Think about frontier airlines,

1491
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:23,180
right?
What's up with them?

1492
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:23,970
They're in trouble.

1493
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:28,520
Their whole worldview is so utterly 
distorted and twisted and the things you

1494
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:30,590
believe are totally untethered to 
reality,

1495
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:31,543
but yet you believe there's knowledge.
You believe it's knowledge because it's 

1496
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:36,080
published and think about what it does.
The students had picked this stuff up.

1497
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:37,490
You go to college,
you picked us up,

1498
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:40,160
you start majoring in it.
You could be majoring in something where

1499
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:42,020
you actually learn to do critical 
thinking,

1500
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:45,210
to engage with ideas.
If your dIstrict,

1501
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,173
if you're,
if you're disadvantaged going into 

1502
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:48,254
college,
that's your best chance to get out of 

1503
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:52,520
that situation is to grapple with great 
critical thinking.

1504
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,800
Learn some great skills,
whether that's,

1505
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,840
you know,
engineering and the sciences,

1506
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,703
something like that.
Whether it's even if it's you want to 

1507
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:01,700
get into like studying race in 
sociology,

1508
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:02,534
soft sciences,
or you want to get into just literature 

1509
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,530
do it honestly,
and you're going to get somewhere,

1510
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:07,364
but you get into this stuff where you 
can literally just make up your 

1511
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:09,734
conclusions.

1512
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,663
What are you doing?
You're teaching these people how to 

1513
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:12,284
think about problems or seeing the 
burger and the santa monica pier is a 

1514
01:10:14,781 --> 01:10:17,450
problem.
Now I see it everywhere I go after I did

1515
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:18,284
this for a year.
So you get the people in the habit of 

1516
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:22,670
seeing problems everywhere.
Are you helping them?

1517
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,640
Are you getting them at a book about 
this or anything?

1518
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,920
You know,
we might one day that's a great idea for

1519
01:10:27,921 --> 01:10:28,754
a book.
The hard part is we could actually 

1520
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:34,040
probably write 10 books,
so condensing it down to a book,

1521
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,290
usually you got an idea and you have to 
blow it up to a book.

1522
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,880
We have to condense this down to a book 
and they're talking about the problem,

1523
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,490
like just explaining what you've already
explained on this podcast and,

1524
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:45,324
and,
and actually having those studies that 

1525
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:48,314
you did publish and the whole thought 
process behind creating them will be a 

1526
01:10:52,221 --> 01:10:52,990
great book.

1527
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:57,920
We got a documentary happening about it.
Mike nina is a documented tarian from,

1528
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,430
uh,
from Australia that got hooked up with a

1529
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,403
z,
a white male.

1530
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,980
He's not around.
He's half black,

1531
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,250
half black watch album.
How we met mike.

1532
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,151
oh yeah.
So,

1533
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:08,984
um,
it's interesting because we were 

1534
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,383
starting out this project and then we up
talking and we couldn't talk to anybody 

1535
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,404
about it.
It's so hard to keep a fucking secret 

1536
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:18,241
this big.
Right?

1537
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,730
You just want to tell people like,
you aren't gonna believe what I'm doing.

1538
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,953
Can't tell anybody.
So we fInd a few trusted friends were 

1539
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:26,400
telling us one guy,
a buddy of ours,

1540
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:27,450
and he's like,
oh my god,

1541
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:30,120
I know a documentary ian,
who's making,

1542
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:33,450
who's investigating all this shit going 
on in the universities already.

1543
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:34,284
He's already interested.
Would you guys be interested in this 

1544
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:36,504
will be a compelling documentary?
Would you guys be interested in talking 

1545
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:39,090
to them?

1546
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,850
So we,
we get in touch with him and he's like,

1547
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,610
listen,
you know,

1548
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:45,840
I'll shoot this.
I think there's a,

1549
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:46,674
there's a film here,
I think you're going to ruin your 

1550
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:48,880
career.
so that's what I'm going to film.

1551
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,420
But in any case I'll film this,
but here's the deal.

1552
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:55,410
I'm only going to shoot it if you commit
100 percent transparency.

1553
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,300
Let me tell the full story.
honestly,

1554
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:58,920
what's really happening?
You know,

1555
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:02,040
we don't get to sugar coat anything and 
make you guys look good.

1556
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,200
And of course he thought we were just 
gonna crash and burn.

1557
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,293
That's the only reason I agreed to this.
I was sure that you guys got a torpedo 

1558
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:10,710
your careers like positive.
Yeah.

1559
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:11,544
And so he thought It was going to be 
that and you'd have to convince us to 

1560
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:18,120
let him show it because we wouldn't want
to.

1561
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,760
But does he know that you don't work in 
academia anymore?

1562
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,150
Yeah,
yeah,

1563
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,800
yeah.
But we were doing the project,

1564
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:24,750
so we reached out to him and said,
well,

1565
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,970
through the mutual friend,
how would it ruin your career?

1566
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,360
Well,
I maybe would never get another job if I

1567
01:12:30,361 --> 01:12:32,280
wanted to go back into academia for 
example,

1568
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,560
or I mean I still,
it hasn't happened yet,

1569
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:35,394
but you see people who do academic 
misconduct get banned from ever 

1570
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,180
publishing academic papers again,
that could still come down for me.

1571
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:44,100
I don't know what it probably won't,
but it might.

1572
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:45,600
And if it does,
you knoW,

1573
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:46,434
then if I tried to get a job working for
like a think tank or university or 

1574
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:52,110
anything that depends on that,
I'm locked out of that now.

1575
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,440
So,
um,

1576
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,120
especially it's going to ruin pizza 
career too.

1577
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:58,240
Let's be honest.
He works in,

1578
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,960
he works in not just the university of 
portland state,

1579
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:02,650
you know,
it's like ground zero for you.

1580
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,100
I don't know.
I don't know.

1581
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:07,590
It's going to happen when it's over for 
sure.

1582
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:11,430
They're always like,
I'm not sure what's going to happen.

1583
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:12,603
No,
it's best not to prognosticate too much 

1584
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:15,783
with this stuff you see now we talked 
about bret weinstein and heather a 

1585
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,610
hiring.
They got firebombed right there.

1586
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:25,200
Thing just blew up,
blew the hell up.

1587
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:26,790
And then they got pushed out of their 
jobs.

1588
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,073
But in a sense it's like,
I don't know what I was talking to them 

1589
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:30,654
when we were in portland and it feels 
like they kind of took the fall and 

1590
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:33,870
people are like,
whoa,

1591
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:36,180
that's too far and I don't know if 
that's the case or not,

1592
01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:40,500
but if so maybe that's too far.
like pushing people out of their jobs,

1593
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:42,780
like students patrolling the campus with
bats,

1594
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:44,460
trying to find brett to pull them out of
his car.

1595
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:47,010
If he showed up like that,
I don't care who you are.

1596
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:49,490
That's too far.
I mean that's not even civil society who

1597
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:52,410
thought that was too far though the 
students is not there,

1598
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:54,630
but a lot of people,
like people saw this.

1599
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,850
The role men is like.
Did you think it was too far?

1600
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:58,630
Right?
I thought it was insane.

1601
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,780
I think the government should have come 
in and shut down the school.

1602
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,010
Yeah,
tons of people.

1603
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,980
Tons of people around.
I mean like everyday people who saw this

1604
01:14:04,981 --> 01:14:06,210
story think,
whoa shit,

1605
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:07,044
this stuff's gone too far.
The fact that they're allowing that guy 

1606
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,400
to remain as president.
Oh yeah.

1607
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,280
It's absolutely not.
Absolutely

1608
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,350
not.
When there's that scene in the car,

1609
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,780
wherever it was,
conference room or wherever it was,

1610
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:17,614
when the kids were telling him to put 
his hands down because he's being 

1611
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:20,674
aggressive with his hands,
he puts his hands down and they start 

1612
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:24,220
laughing.
I was like,

1613
01:14:24,221 --> 01:14:28,180
what in the fuck is this?
It is a system set up to where you can't

1614
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:29,680
win is what it is.
Deliberate,

1615
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:32,650
but it's hilarious,
but they were laughing at him.

1616
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,540
He put his hands down.
They're like,

1617
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:36,820
stop making hand gestures.
You're being aggressive.

1618
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,800
He puts his hands down.
They started last.

1619
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:40,490
Sorry last night and I didn't find it 
funny.

1620
01:14:40,491 --> 01:14:41,690
I found it terrifying.
It's.

1621
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,350
I find it terrifying for what it means 
for all of us.

1622
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:45,040
Yeah.
If that.

1623
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,873
If that can happen at a college campus,
I mean that's where ideas are supposed 

1624
01:14:48,431 --> 01:14:50,230
to be shared,
disgust explored,

1625
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,420
etc.
If that can happen at a college campus,

1626
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,370
everything's up for grabs at some point.

1627
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,620
Was that college campuses really 
strange?

1628
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,753
It's really strange.
We're struggling now and have radically 

1629
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,260
radically down.
Yeah.

1630
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:05,710
I mean they could literally go under 
because of this.

1631
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:07,000
It looks like it might happen.
Yeah.

1632
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,940
It's too bad because when it was doing 
well,

1633
01:15:09,941 --> 01:15:10,774
as brett was explaining,
it was a wonderful place to teach 

1634
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:16,180
because he could do whatever he really 
cool stuff.

1635
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:19,170
He could take them to the park and they 
could do a class in the park.

1636
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,220
They could.
He.

1637
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,150
He could have a class where,
you know,

1638
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:23,980
whatever.
Regardless of what he's teaching,

1639
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,250
he could teach you about something else.
Crazy field trips somewhere,

1640
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:28,210
you know,
all this stuff,

1641
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,470
you know,
adventures with the students,

1642
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,510
the creator of the simpsons go there to 
speaking simpsons.

1643
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,603
I think he was an alum from there.
It's such a shame because they're just 

1644
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:40,610
such decent people.
They're just such great.

1645
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,150
They're both great.
They're smart too,

1646
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:47,620
so really legitimately smart and 
fiercely progressive,

1647
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,080
progressive,
decent humans.

1648
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:52,150
Of course that means they're outright 
adjacent.

1649
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,560
Fucking hilarious man.
These people.

1650
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,230
It's a strange,
strange time for ideas,

1651
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,040
but I think this is.
It's also subs.

1652
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:03,183
It's some sort of a symptom of this 
culture that we live in where everyone 

1653
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,030
gets to voice their opinion.
EverYone feels entitled divorced because

1654
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:16,810
of social media,
because of this instantaneous ability to

1655
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,793
post whatever you feel about anything.
Whether it's a comment on youtube or a 

1656
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:26,170
tweet or a facebook post,
this nature of everyone putting in input

1657
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:29,290
instead of earning your right to be 
heard,

1658
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:30,493
you know,
through merit and through your work and 

1659
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:34,300
through people saying,
hey,

1660
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:37,180
this guy is smart,
this girl has great ideas,

1661
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,700
this person really has some good points.
That's tom.

1662
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:41,583
Tom nichols ideas.
Before we used to criticize people from 

1663
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:45,364
a point of expertise.
Now people who have absolutely no 

1664
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:51,550
expertise feel that they're entitled to 
not only criticized,

1665
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:53,650
but have everybody else listened to the 
criticisms.

1666
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,050
I think you're onto something with the 
social media,

1667
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:56,884
right?
Because you post something and it gets 

1668
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:00,230
like four interactions and you're like,
why?

1669
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,790
How come joe rogan's thing got like 
4,000?

1670
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:04,330
It's not fair.
Right?

1671
01:17:04,331 --> 01:17:08,140
And so there's this like kind of 
competitive jealousy kind of thing going

1672
01:17:08,141 --> 01:17:10,100
on and I think we've seen that a lot.

1673
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,060
You know,
these kind of,

1674
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:11,973
you know,
people who don't have a lot to bring to 

1675
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:15,370
the table and they want to get,
you know,

1676
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,213
maybe it's a spot on a podcast,
maybe they want to get on a conference 

1677
01:17:19,671 --> 01:17:20,930
or something.
Speaker in a conference,

1678
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,060
and we've seen this for years,
what happens is,

1679
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,193
well,
you know you got some big name that's 

1680
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:25,761
coming.
Well,

1681
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:28,790
let's just can him and say,
well,

1682
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,710
he's a sexist.
He said this terrible thing.

1683
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,900
Now he can't be at the conference or 
will protest.

1684
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,153
Get him out,
put one of our guys in or when they 

1685
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:37,610
start to get more power,
it's like,

1686
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:38,444
let's make sure half of our people are 
there or else we're going to make sure 

1687
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:44,420
that we sell your conferences racist.
Then that becomeS like just a hot mess.

1688
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:47,150
Nobody wants to go to the conference.
It's not going to be financially soluble

1689
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,180
so it falls apart.
I mean this stuff has been going on.

1690
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:51,014
This seems to be what's going on and I 
think you're touching something where 

1691
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:53,714
social media and tom nichols talks about
it to generating a kind of narcissism 

1692
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,530
where people feel entitled,
like I have a voice.

1693
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,723
Nobody's listening to me,
but they should listen to me because 

1694
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:05,030
they of course think that their ideas 
are great

1695
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,710
and the rise of social media coincides 
with shutting down.

1696
01:18:08,711 --> 01:18:13,030
Speakers absolutely occurs on campus.
It didn't use to happen that way,

1697
01:18:13,031 --> 01:18:13,864
used to be even if people protested it,
the speech went on and people debated 

1698
01:18:17,711 --> 01:18:18,544
that person or the people got a chance 
during the q and a section to challenge 

1699
01:18:21,611 --> 01:18:23,200
these ideas.
That's what it's all about.

1700
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,790
What it's supposed to be all about.
Yeah.

1701
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:29,660
If you have a problematic person,
you have a person that you feel is at.

1702
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:30,573
They have ideas that are questionable.
You bring in a person whose ideas you 

1703
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:35,464
feel our counter and you let the 
audience see how these individuals 

1704
01:18:41,111 --> 01:18:43,170
discussed these things.
When I was in highschool,

1705
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:48,270
barney frank debated some guy from.
He was a very conservative person.

1706
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,613
I forget what the.
There was a ridiculous conservative 

1707
01:18:54,071 --> 01:18:56,920
group that had some really funny name.
Uh,

1708
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:59,160
I forgot what it was,
but he was like,

1709
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:00,820
this really can.

1710
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:04,420
Ronald reagan style conservative and 
barney frank was.

1711
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,520
I think he was still in the closet back 
then,

1712
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,593
but he was this like very articulate,
powerful left wing guy and they did it 

1713
01:19:13,991 --> 01:19:18,991
inside this a community center in our 
high school,

1714
01:19:19,091 --> 01:19:20,020
whatever it was,
you know,

1715
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:25,090
some auditorium.
And I got a chance to watch this one guy

1716
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,950
talk about all these different,
what you know,

1717
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:30,490
whatever it was,
gay marriage or whatever is conservative

1718
01:19:30,491 --> 01:19:31,324
ideas and values and a marriage should 
be between a man and a woman and all 

1719
01:19:34,661 --> 01:19:39,160
these different things that would today 
at a lot of college campuses,

1720
01:19:39,161 --> 01:19:42,550
you'd want those shutdowns.
You don't want someone propagating these

1721
01:19:42,551 --> 01:19:43,384
ideas,
but barney frank came on after him and 

1722
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:46,773
eloquently dissected what was stupid 
about it and what the constitution is 

1723
01:19:50,951 --> 01:19:51,784
all about.
What makes America great is our freedom 

1724
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,920
and our ability to express ourselves.
And by doing so,

1725
01:19:56,921 --> 01:20:01,921
me as a 16 year old kid and the audience
got to see ideas,

1726
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:07,680
dissected and ideas debated and see two 
people from polar opposite perspectives.

1727
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,370
just battle it out and let the best idea
win.

1728
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,353
And I'm sure there was probably some 
people that were in that audience that 

1729
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:19,890
came out of it with a different 
perspective.

1730
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:20,963
Like,
yeah,

1731
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,310
gay people shouldn't get married and 
yeah,

1732
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:25,470
marriage is supposed to be between a man
and woman.

1733
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,180
I'm sure of it.
I'm sure of it.

1734
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,580
And that's what happens in a democracy.

1735
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,210
Yes,
you're talking about the very foundation

1736
01:20:32,211 --> 01:20:33,044
of liberal society.
You're talking about John Stuart mill 

1737
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:35,690
here.
I mean,

1738
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:39,890
did you talking about John Adams?
You're talking about the foundation of a

1739
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:43,140
liberal society here and that's what the
scholarship runs that were.

1740
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,990
We looked at runs directly counter to 
this.

1741
01:20:44,991 --> 01:20:48,320
Remember the idea is that if people are 
putting out language,

1742
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:52,850
the idea that some people are going to 
come away with a heteronormative idea or

1743
01:20:52,851 --> 01:20:55,940
a homophobic idea.
That's already a catastrophe.

1744
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,050
Yes.
Show.

1745
01:20:57,051 --> 01:20:57,884
We can't allow it.
We got to pull the speaker wires like 

1746
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,460
demora event we've got.
We can't let that go on.

1747
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,353
yeah,
that's my point is like what happened 

1748
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,673
where know these kind of interactions 
between contrary ideas is so it's so 

1749
01:21:13,971 --> 01:21:18,440
dangerous that one or two people could 
possibly be shifted.

1750
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:20,390
I mean even if it's thirtY percent of 
the audience,

1751
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:21,224
I mean who the fuck knows what?
What's gonna happen when people are 

1752
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:26,030
sitting there listening and who's to say
that you're right or you're wrong,

1753
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:30,320
that the way to challenge ideas is not 
pulling the plug on the speakers.

1754
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,750
It's a better ideas.

1755
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:32,653
If you,
if you fundamentally subscribed to the 

1756
01:21:34,341 --> 01:21:35,174
idea that heteronormativity,
let's use it as the example of 

1757
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:39,164
heteronormativity is the power structure
that's holding down gay people and 

1758
01:21:41,751 --> 01:21:43,790
preventing them from having equal 
opportunities.

1759
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:47,960
If you fundamentally believe that 
anybody else getting convinced,

1760
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,823
anybody being reinforcement of the idea 
of heteronormativity isn't just a few 

1761
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,890
like 70 percent changed their mind and 
30 percent stuck with it.

1762
01:21:55,190 --> 01:22:00,190
That's just bolstering the already 
imagined to be completely dominant view.

1763
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,300
It's really kind of anti progress,
right?

1764
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:06,170
Because it views the idea that power 
structures can't change.

1765
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,660
They're always rooted in some identity.
Whoever has,

1766
01:22:08,661 --> 01:22:10,880
you know there's more straight people 
than gay people are.

1767
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,820
Okay,
so therefore straight people always have

1768
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:14,803
power.
Therefore anything that reinforces 

1769
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:18,740
heteronormativity is going to be a 
catastrophe.

1770
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:19,574
That reinforces the next thing you know,
people are going to be beating gays in 

1771
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:22,274
the snow or something

1772
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,213
that it's also the complete infant 
stylization of young adults because 

1773
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:28,923
you're.
You're telling me these young adults 

1774
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:33,920
aren't smart enough to dIfferentiate 
between good ideas and bad ideas.

1775
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,853
Well,
if they're learning all this grievance 

1776
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:36,444
study stuff,
I just said their critical thinking is 

1777
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:38,754
getting hobbled,

1778
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:42,660
but if you're a person who's a young,
progressive,

1779
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:43,494
well read person who's got some rock 
solid ideas about people being able to 

1780
01:22:49,141 --> 01:22:49,974
live their lives without discrimination 
and all the things that I'm sure we all 

1781
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:54,264
agree on,
and you sat and listened to some right 

1782
01:22:57,331 --> 01:23:00,810
wing,
alright asshole spewing hate.

1783
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,000
Is it going to change you?
It's gonna affect you.

1784
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,950
Of course it's not.
So who is it going to affect?

1785
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,490
Like who?
Who are these ideas going to reach?

1786
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:14,610
Why do we assume that people are so much
more easily influenced than we are?

1787
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:17,350
What,
what is that about?

1788
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:21,460
this isn't this infant.
Teleportation is young adults.

1789
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:25,090
Kids.
It's fucking nerve in the world.

1790
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:28,740
And sharp corners.
Got to put a fucking cane off and hide.

1791
01:23:28,741 --> 01:23:30,190
Just published that.
A book,

1792
01:23:30,191 --> 01:23:33,480
the coddling of the american mind.
And,

1793
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:35,120
and,
and uh,

1794
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:36,243
I think if you look at [inaudible] work 
and the heterodox academy and he's 

1795
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:42,700
fighting for this,
but we have infant infantilize people,

1796
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:46,000
we've have infantilized students and I 
don't,

1797
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,370
I hope that the tide changing.
I don't know,

1798
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:49,204
one of the things we wanted to do with 
this project is give people the 

1799
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:53,980
opportunity to speak out and say,
you know,

1800
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,053
they don't speak for me.
I want to hear what someone has to say 

1801
01:23:57,071 --> 01:23:58,800
about immigration.
The other side,

1802
01:23:58,810 --> 01:23:59,643
quote unquote I want to hear which I 
want to hear the best arguments because 

1803
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:05,280
then I want to engage them myself and 
you know,

1804
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,990
I also think that we should have people 
of all.

1805
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:13,270
I think it's a problem that people who 
go into teaching.

1806
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,080
I can't remember what the study I read 
the overwhelming percentage of people,

1807
01:24:17,081 --> 01:24:19,060
college educators are on the left.
I'm on the left.

1808
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,600
I think that's a problem.
I think that they need diverse voices.

1809
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,073
diversity also has to be ideological 
diversity and if you want people to be 

1810
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,630
less brittle and if you want people to 
be less infantilized,

1811
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,090
they have to hear the other side,
but they have to hear.

1812
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,223
This is also a mills' idea.
They have to hear it from people who 

1813
01:24:37,451 --> 01:24:38,284
believe it.

1814
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:43,160
That's in John Stuart mill's book on 
liberty is it's not enough to have heard

1815
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,020
that.
The other side.

1816
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,193
The argument from the other side exists,
you need to hear the best case put 

1817
01:24:47,631 --> 01:24:48,464
forward by people who really,
really subscribed to it and then work 

1818
01:24:50,631 --> 01:24:53,990
against that if you can defeat that,
than it deserves to be defeated.

1819
01:24:53,991 --> 01:24:54,760
Right?
Yeah,

1820
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,710
and this is the thing I think in 
general,

1821
01:24:57,711 --> 01:24:58,544
human beings,
we all put forth our best ideas and 

1822
01:24:59,811 --> 01:25:01,310
we're all wrong.
MosT of the time we're all.

1823
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:03,290
We can be a smart guy or a smart woman,
whatever.

1824
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:06,020
We're all pretty stupid.
We put forth a lot of ideas.

1825
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:08,630
Most of them are wrong.
It's true for everybody,

1826
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,471
true for you,
me,

1827
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:13,250
everybody and what we should really be 
relying on his.

1828
01:25:13,251 --> 01:25:14,540
You know,
I put it on an idea and you're like,

1829
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:15,440
well,
I don't know about that.

1830
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,100
And so we start cutting away the 
bullshit that I tuck tucked into my idea

1831
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:20,180
of the stuff I didn't have.
Right?

1832
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:23,990
We do that and now the idea that 
survives that process is better,

1833
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:25,730
and then somebody else comes along and 
says,

1834
01:25:25,731 --> 01:25:26,121
wait,
wait,

1835
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:26,954
wait.
That part's probably a little bit 

1836
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:28,214
bullshit,
but this you could add to it and then 

1837
01:25:29,231 --> 01:25:30,064
make it better.
And then some of that's wrong and this 

1838
01:25:31,401 --> 01:25:35,150
is the process of how we really produce 
knowledge and it's a co two.

1839
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,253
That's what gives us a vibrant culture 
to write it as opposed to what we see 

1840
01:25:39,111 --> 01:25:40,760
here,
where I can we,

1841
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,230
the three of us can make up a 
conclusion,

1842
01:25:42,231 --> 01:25:45,410
write a paper to support it.
And then if you criticize it,

1843
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:46,603
you had to have criticized it because 
you were sexist or because you were 

1844
01:25:48,981 --> 01:25:49,814
racist.
If you do a scientific test that shows 

1845
01:25:51,681 --> 01:25:52,514
that it's wrong,
the science must have been sexist or 

1846
01:25:54,711 --> 01:25:57,710
racist or anything.
Once you're doing that,

1847
01:25:57,711 --> 01:26:00,080
you're just,
you're really in the weeds,

1848
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:03,980
you're not helping anybody.
And we need to study areas,

1849
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,620
gender and race,
but we need to do it.

1850
01:26:05,621 --> 01:26:06,560
Right?
Yeah.

1851
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:10,640
And we need to do it freely where you 
could just talk and you don't,

1852
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:11,474
you,
you don't get accused of all sorts of 

1853
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:14,930
horrible transgressions.
Exactly.

1854
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,090
And that's not,
that's the culture that I,

1855
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,970
that we want to see in here.
And that's not the culture we have.

1856
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:21,090
Well I think there's,
you know,

1857
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:23,890
everyone is railing against identity 
politics.

1858
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,960
I think we can all agree identity 
politics are a huge problem,

1859
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,033
but another problem that goes along with
it hand in hand is identifying 

1860
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:36,821
personally with ideas where these ideas 
are connected to your ego identity.

1861
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:38,643
Exactly.
Yeah.

1862
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:40,603
Did you call everybody'S wrong about god
and it sounds like I'm just going to go 

1863
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:45,284
after religion,
but it's actually the culmination of my 

1864
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:51,791
study of religious psychology and so 
really what it was was targeting pr.

1865
01:26:53,281 --> 01:26:54,114
I mean it talks about what's going on 
with religion and why people believe 

1866
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,014
religion and what god actually stands 
for in terms of psychology as it might 

1867
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:03,350
see it,
but then what was really targeting was I

1868
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:05,220
saw all these people who are like,
you know,

1869
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,073
loud mouth atheists and they were like 
this and that and the other thing and 

1870
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:09,760
they have this whole community and I 
saw,

1871
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,360
holy shit,
they're doing the same thing.

1872
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,373
Yes.
They're doing the same thing and what 

1873
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:15,920
are they doing?
They're identifying as an atheist,

1874
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:18,380
I am an atheist.
What does that mean?

1875
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:19,640
Well,
I want to be a good atheist.

1876
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:22,060
How the fuck do you be a good atheist?
It doesn't make any sense.

1877
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,000
You remember atheism plus atheism plus 
was exactly what I was looking at.

1878
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:27,403
Favorite was live,
watched a whole speech like smoking a 

1879
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:32,744
joint and laughing my fucking ass off at
this dork who is speaking in front of 

1880
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:41,561
some other group of dorks that we're all
part of the atheism plus movement and he

1881
01:27:41,571 --> 01:27:42,404
just kept just ranting about sexual 
harassment and diversity and all these 

1882
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:51,230
different things and attaching them to 
atheist.

1883
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:52,410
Exactly.
Motherfucker.

1884
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,370
You're making your own religion.
Exactly.

1885
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:56,780
Exactly.
That's exactly right.

1886
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:58,670
Hi.
Joe rogan saw straight through.

1887
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:03,671
It was so fun because the guy was such a
virtue signaling little weasel.

1888
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,750
Totally.
Totally.

1889
01:28:05,751 --> 01:28:08,520
It was sneaky fucker.
Yeah,

1890
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:10,800
a little sneaky fucker that was trying 
to get girls to like him.

1891
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,290
I guarantee you that.
Yo,

1892
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:15,020
you see what it is though.
I got to be a good atheist.

1893
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:15,711
How do I do it?
Well,

1894
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:18,650
I don't know because atheist means don't
believe stuff of a certain kind,

1895
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:23,860
so they have to start plus plus what 
social justice.

1896
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,700
How did that died off because it didn't 
work,

1897
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:27,710
but those people are still grumbling 
around or whatever.

1898
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:29,180
BuT what happened?
Oh,

1899
01:28:29,181 --> 01:28:31,550
they got a whole blog.
They play about her project.

1900
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:32,740
Yeah.
Said,

1901
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,120
yeah,
we're straight white men.

1902
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:36,223
oh,
well you're a straight white man were 

1903
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:40,040
therefore we have bad motivations.
Motivations.

1904
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:44,120
That's we get all time because we're 
straight white men because bad bad white

1905
01:28:44,121 --> 01:28:44,954
men,
straight white men are basically like a 

1906
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:46,934
little arrow running around looking for 
vaginas and anything you say is 

1907
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:55,070
basically just a little sneaky way for 
you to get inside of a vagina and all of

1908
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:56,030
this stuff.
You just,

1909
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:59,780
you just try making your way through 
society.

1910
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:01,740
It's a little ironic when you Put it 
that way,

1911
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:03,750
just what it is.
right?

1912
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:05,900
But the truth is though,
that if they think that the.

1913
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:06,883
I mean this is the article of faith 
years that privilege exists and always 

1914
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:11,190
preserves itself.
So we're straight white men.

1915
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:15,150
We criticized what supposed to be but 
isn't social justice work?

1916
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,710
It's bad.
Social justice work,

1917
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:19,200
you know,
capital social justice screwed up.

1918
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,960
So we criticize that.
Therefore why we must be,

1919
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:25,190
because we're white man trying 
motivation or standard.

1920
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:26,940
Yep.
You guys are a problem.

1921
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:30,210
that was the depth of their analysis,
given that they're,

1922
01:29:30,211 --> 01:29:31,044
you know,
like some of them are professors and 

1923
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:33,490
stuff that's the best they could come up
with,

1924
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,310
been better to say,
you know what,

1925
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:37,063
there's a problem here and we want to 
study this stuff and we need to clean 

1926
01:29:40,111 --> 01:29:42,660
house and thank you guys,
we appreciate it,

1927
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,673
but you would have to step so far out of
your belief system and be so objective 

1928
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:49,134
and so self aware that you're realizing 
you're in some sort of a preposterous 

1929
01:29:52,531 --> 01:29:57,210
group and very few people are willing to
admit that most of their life's work has

1930
01:29:57,211 --> 01:29:58,044
been nonsense.

1931
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:58,913
Yeah.
Especially when you geT rewarded for 

1932
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:01,890
that,
you get promoted for that.

1933
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:04,830
you get accolades from that.
You carry status and privilege.

1934
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:05,873
Look at me when people join some fucking
wacky caught like they don't join it 

1935
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:10,290
saying,
yeah,

1936
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:11,760
this is bullshit,
but it'll be fun.

1937
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:12,923
They didn't believe it.
They buy into it and this is no 

1938
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:18,570
different.
It's like what we're talking about,

1939
01:30:18,571 --> 01:30:19,404
about ideologies,
how people they lock into these 

1940
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,374
predetermined patterns of thinking and 
behavior and this is what's happening 

1941
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:25,854
here and it's very much like a call.
It's very much like any other group 

1942
01:30:29,701 --> 01:30:30,534
think sort of environment.
It's like scientology grew up in the 

1943
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:34,494
university,
so everything they put out about 

1944
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,343
threatens and volcanoes or whatever 
they've got all of a sudden that's not 

1945
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,280
like just crazy.
You know,

1946
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,680
l ron hubbard,
was it dianetics or whatever.

1947
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:47,550
That's gold standard knowledge.
Academic press,

1948
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,713
oxford.

1949
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,310
So you get a degree.
yeah.

1950
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:52,530
And then you get to teach it and as 
somebody.

1951
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,900
Somebody wrote an article criticizing us
history and they're like,

1952
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,070
oh,
they don't understand.

1953
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:57,143
You know,
they thInk we just talked to each other 

1954
01:30:57,781 --> 01:30:59,820
in a bubble.
We talk to policymakers,

1955
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,460
we talked to media and it's like,
no shit.

1956
01:31:02,461 --> 01:31:03,680
That's why we did this.
You know,

1957
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:04,523
when you talk to you,
you do talk to other people you are 

1958
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:08,650
running into,
you know,

1959
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:09,603
per sorry hr departments.
You're telling them how to do the 

1960
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:16,170
diversity officers and all those 
institutional and talk to policymakers.

1961
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,033
I get emails.
I don't know if you saw a year before 

1962
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:20,400
all this,
we did this really,

1963
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:21,234
you know,
bad attempt at it called conceptual 

1964
01:31:22,231 --> 01:31:23,064
penis as a social construct.
So we said that penIses are social 

1965
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:30,330
constructs and they cause climate change
and this got a little bit of attention.

1966
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:31,493
I've been getting emails ever since then
from some member of eu parliament and 

1967
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:35,784
they're like,
we have another gender initiative that 

1968
01:31:37,261 --> 01:31:38,094
we're going to try to basically foist 
upon you and then it's going to like 

1969
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:45,420
dictate how europe now works with africa
going forward about climate.

1970
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:46,463
And so because I wrote this conceptual 
penis and climate change thing and it's 

1971
01:31:48,481 --> 01:31:49,231
all based on,
you know,

1972
01:31:49,231 --> 01:31:51,690
making fun of gender studies.
It was at the time anyway,

1973
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,580
they were like,
you know,

1974
01:31:53,581 --> 01:31:55,490
you're an expert.
So now that you use colomy,

1975
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:56,363
you know,
what do we do about this gender 

1976
01:31:57,091 --> 01:31:58,440
initiative?
But that's real,

1977
01:31:58,441 --> 01:31:58,851
right?
The,

1978
01:31:58,851 --> 01:32:02,280
you parliament is not like nothing.
That's not,

1979
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,420
that's not,
you know,

1980
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:07,150
it's not like a meeting of some dorks at
a conference that's real.

1981
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,860
They're coming up with policy to dictate
how they want to interact with,

1982
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,720
with africa for the next 20,
30 years.

1983
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:15,303
That's real.
And these people are emailing me saying 

1984
01:32:17,051 --> 01:32:20,440
this scholarship that you guys are 
criticizing is really,

1985
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:23,440
you know,
it's on the agenda of the eu parliament.

1986
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:25,840
So help.
Alright,

1987
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:26,973
well it seems like what we're,
what we have here is sort of a wave of 

1988
01:32:30,101 --> 01:32:31,180
ideas,
right?

1989
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:35,140
It goes in and it goes out and it's 
going back and forth and you,

1990
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,003
you need this sort of balancing act and 
there are great things need to go so 

1991
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:42,873
haywire that people step in and go,
well I'm pulling my fucking kids at 

1992
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:48,330
evergreen state.
Yup.

1993
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:49,950
This is crazy.
It.

1994
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:53,710
That's a great example of a place that 
went too far.

1995
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,530
Yeah,
and what we don't want to have happen is

1996
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,393
we don't want people to pull their kids 
out of the universities know because 

1997
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,510
there are some,
not the university,

1998
01:33:01,511 --> 01:33:04,090
but these departments don't major in it.
Exactly.

1999
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:05,400
Don't major in it,
but it's which,

2000
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,450
which department?
specific gender studies.

2001
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,070
Critical race studies,
cultural studies,

2002
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:11,410
queer theory,
fat studies.

2003
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:15,760
If it happens to have one.
I've read a biography of guy who teaches

2004
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:17,680
critical whiteness.
Oh yeah.

2005
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:22,120
CrItical whiteness is a thing that 
actually there was a journal and then it

2006
01:33:22,121 --> 01:33:22,954
got.
It got so out there that it got 

2007
01:33:24,071 --> 01:33:27,040
criticized out of existence,
but it's a big thing.

2008
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:30,970
There's some big paper I was reading 
just before we went public with all this

2009
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:31,983
and I got asked about it.
Luckily I read it because we did the 

2010
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:36,070
mind calm.
Of course Israel is like,

2011
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:37,720
you got mine comp published.
Oh my god,

2012
01:33:37,721 --> 01:33:40,060
we need to talk to you.
Israel tv.

2013
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:43,630
I was on israeli tv.
What the hell?

2014
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:44,613
And so all these israeli journalist or 
calling me talking to me about it and 

2015
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,200
over the mind,
confident I read this one paper.

2016
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:50,801
They're lIke,
well,

2017
01:33:50,801 --> 01:33:52,810
do you think that jewish studies is like
this?

2018
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,300
And I found this paper just before this 
all came out.

2019
01:33:55,301 --> 01:33:56,134
There was jewish studies criticizing 
critical whiteness studies because 

2020
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:00,214
there's this whole thing about how the 
critical whiteness people who accused 

2021
01:34:02,441 --> 01:34:04,360
the jews of being white and then there's
all this,

2022
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,650
you know,
who's,

2023
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,910
where does the oppression like.
Because you know,

2024
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:12,520
the jews have had it pretty rough over 
the last 2000 years or thereabouts,

2025
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:15,790
but then you've got the critical 
whiteness people being like,

2026
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:17,080
no,
they're white,

2027
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,640
it's a white privilege,
blah,

2028
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:19,483
blah blah.
And then the jewish studies people are 

2029
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:22,300
like,
hold up,

2030
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,163
you know,
don't put us up here and say that we're 

2031
01:34:25,361 --> 01:34:27,100
all white supremacists,
you know,

2032
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:29,070
we were gassed by the white 
supremacists.

2033
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:31,360
You chill out.
So there's this huge,

2034
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:32,194
like critical studies fight between the 
jewish studies people and the critical 

2035
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:36,814
whiteness people over whether jews count
as white people are not and have white 

2036
01:34:39,491 --> 01:34:40,480
supremacy built in.

2037
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:43,330
And they asked me about thIs israeli 
journalist said.

2038
01:34:43,331 --> 01:34:43,781
And I was like,
well,

2039
01:34:43,781 --> 01:34:47,020
you know,
I have to sympathize with what their,

2040
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:47,973
their argument is.
But they're still using the same broken 

2041
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:50,104
methods.
And so you still want to see better 

2042
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:52,150
methods.
Right.

2043
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,130
I think the,
the jewish people have a point,

2044
01:34:54,131 --> 01:34:54,964
you know,
we've been pretty heavily oppressed for 

2045
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,520
2000 years.
You sTarted with like,

2046
01:34:58,790 --> 01:34:59,623
you know,
the romans decimating them and then the 

2047
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:05,150
diaspora and then to holocaust and every
it's just not good.

2048
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:08,570
So I think they have a point that,
you know,

2049
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,160
don't just say,
oh,

2050
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:13,220
we have crazy white privilege and are 
there for white supremacists,

2051
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:15,110
but if you want to do that,
you know,

2052
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:17,420
maybe this methodology of,
of,

2053
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,730
of complaining about it's not the best 
way to go.

2054
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,313
It's complicated stuff,
but at least they're against the 

2055
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:24,614
critical whiteness stuff.
This critical whiteness thing you were 

2056
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:29,660
saying is,
is they have a journal.

2057
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,450
They did the journal of whiteness 
studies or something like that.

2058
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,333
Critical whiteness.
It lasted for about three years and I 

2059
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:38,354
don't know exactly why it fell apart,
but it fell apart because I was really 

2060
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:44,090
upset because I wanted to send a paper 
to it and it doesn't exist anymore.

2061
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:46,423
What were you gonna say to the paper on 
the rewrite of mind for the woman that 

2062
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:51,380
lesbian woman excoriates around 
whiteness.

2063
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,590
It was going to send it to that journal 
and then it doesn't exist anymore.

2064
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:56,630
So I had to send it to a critical race 
journal who then said,

2065
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,610
ah,
it's a good idea,

2066
01:35:58,611 --> 01:36:02,360
but you're positioning yourself as a 
good white and that's a problem.

2067
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:03,620
So we can publish.
By the way,

2068
01:36:03,621 --> 01:36:04,760
we would.
They're all in line.

2069
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:07,010
We were completely transparent and 
honest with everybody.

2070
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,550
You can just google drive or google 
drive with every paper comments,

2071
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:14,150
comments to everything that mike made,
his videos.

2072
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:15,480
Everything is up there.
Yeah.

2073
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:18,600
It's totally free for everybody.
Yeah.

2074
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:22,330
We get accused of being grifters.
We don't have a how.

2075
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:23,283
How are we grifting?
It's in a google drive that anybody can 

2076
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:29,480
just go download all of it.
I don't recall getting money for that.

2077
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:31,550
We want it.
We really do think that that.

2078
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,553
And I'm.

2079
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:34,650
Yeah,
there you go.

2080
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:39,770
Swedish professor rebels.
Oh yeah.

2081
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:41,283
A couple of days ago,
one of sweden's most merited in claim 

2082
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:47,520
political scientists and longterm 
critics of identity politics.

2083
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:52,020
Bow rothstein.
Rothstein has argued that identity based

2084
01:36:52,021 --> 01:36:52,854
disciplines like grievance studies,
which deals with the concept of 

2085
01:36:55,321 --> 01:36:57,720
collective guilt,
have no place in academia.

2086
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,070
Yeah.
Grievance studies is.

2087
01:36:59,100 --> 01:36:59,933
Yeah,
right on.

2088
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:01,850
Yeah,
we,

2089
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:02,610
we,
we,

2090
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:03,443
we came up with greed and study,
so delighted to see that that's caught 

2091
01:37:06,361 --> 01:37:07,194
on to start a podcast immediately and a 
patrion page so that you don't have to 

2092
01:37:11,281 --> 01:37:13,070
worry about losing your house.
Yeah,

2093
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:14,680
exactly.
I mean,

2094
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,710
I don't know how it is in Sweden.
Yeah,

2095
01:37:16,711 --> 01:37:18,690
I don't either,
but that guy's probably screwed.

2096
01:37:18,691 --> 01:37:20,620
Whatever the fuck they did with Jordan 
Peterson,

2097
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:23,100
they created a god damn monster.
Oh yeah.

2098
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:23,963
You guys fucked up.
Guys created a multimillionaire whose 

2099
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:26,963
worldwide famous and there's a huge 
bestseller and he was just talking to 

2100
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:33,720
swedish politicians on tv the other day,
so watch out.

2101
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,970
They fucked up with him.
Boy,

2102
01:37:35,971 --> 01:37:38,280
did they fuck up and dave was just 
texting me.

2103
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,560
A friend.
Reuben was just texting me pictures that

2104
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:41,483
all full.
It's crazy in the energy in that place 

2105
01:37:43,741 --> 01:37:46,170
is crazy.
He's selling out 5,000

2106
01:37:46,171 --> 01:37:48,010
seat theaters.
He's a rock star.

2107
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:50,620
It's a fucking rock star.
He's an intellectual rockstar.

2108
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:51,810
It's hilarious.
Good for him.

2109
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:52,621
Yeah.
I mean,

2110
01:37:52,621 --> 01:37:53,454
look,
a lot of other guys are doing it to sam 

2111
01:37:54,271 --> 01:37:55,620
harris is doing that as well.

2112
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,840
They're doing these gigantic huge 
speeches.

2113
01:37:57,841 --> 01:38:01,740
It's like good for him.
What will absolutely good for him,

2114
01:38:01,741 --> 01:38:02,574
but what I'm excited about is how many 
people are interested in the debate of 

2115
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:13,140
ideas and that this is not happening on 
the college campuses,

2116
01:38:13,141 --> 01:38:17,310
but a lot of these people that are 
graduated have graduated from college or

2117
01:38:17,311 --> 01:38:19,440
or you know,
in the working world.

2118
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,750
They're very fascinated by this.

2119
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:23,310
It's real.
It's what you were saying.

2120
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:25,110
It's been suppressed for long enough 
now.

2121
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,120
Jordan peterson,
what was his thing?

2122
01:38:27,121 --> 01:38:27,954
He was like,
you're not going to tell me the words I 

2123
01:38:28,741 --> 01:38:32,700
can use when they're 78 different words 
for genders.

2124
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:33,923
I can safely say you're fucking crazy.
That's like this desperation to try to 

2125
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:39,774
find a unique identity that you can 
consider it to be super special or 

2126
01:38:42,241 --> 01:38:43,320
whatever.
It's totally,

2127
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,503
but it's.
And you want to see even crazier as you 

2128
01:38:45,511 --> 01:38:47,250
go into,
like you go on these blogs.

2129
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:49,980
I Think they're mostly on tumblr or 
something that violates my rule.

2130
01:38:49,981 --> 01:38:50,814
never use tumbler where they talk about 
the different sexual sexuality 

2131
01:38:54,451 --> 01:38:56,280
identities,
like different kinds of,

2132
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:57,373
you know,
I'm interested in this kind of personal 

2133
01:38:59,101 --> 01:38:59,934
but not this kind of person under these 
circumstances but not under those that 

2134
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:02,844
has like some 18 syllable academic word 
for it now and there's people whose 

2135
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:08,550
whole,
I don't think their academics.

2136
01:39:08,551 --> 01:39:10,550
I think there are activists geeks on 
tumbler,

2137
01:39:10,551 --> 01:39:11,384
but they come up with these crazy 
descriptions and there's like hundreds 

2138
01:39:14,191 --> 01:39:15,690
of sexual orientations.

2139
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,013
Yeah.
It's just people wanting to be 

2140
01:39:18,531 --> 01:39:19,364
different.
I think it'd be special and they're not 

2141
01:39:20,571 --> 01:39:21,404
good at anything.
That's I think something that was the 

2142
01:39:23,481 --> 01:39:24,314
other part of.
I guess one of the things that jim said 

2143
01:39:26,181 --> 01:39:29,510
when I said I was more cynical,
I think that the in general,

2144
01:39:29,511 --> 01:39:34,511
the critics tend to be angry and I'm not
saying that their anger is legitimate or

2145
01:39:35,631 --> 01:39:37,340
illegitimate,
but they send to be angry.

2146
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:40,040
They seem to be almost universally under
accomplished,

2147
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,740
so they're upset at you because you have
whatever,

2148
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:45,640
a big show or lot of fault or they're 
whatever.

2149
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:48,520
They're upset about big platform 
audience there.

2150
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,553
They're just generally disagreeable 
people and they found these communities 

2151
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:57,260
of other people who are enraged,
who are also under accomplished,

2152
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,770
who they can laugh,
they can lash out at people together,

2153
01:40:00,771 --> 01:40:01,604
and then virtue signal you get rewarded 
for all know rogan that bat whatever 

2154
01:40:05,811 --> 01:40:09,720
they want to call you or whatever they 
want to call us or whoever else,

2155
01:40:09,721 --> 01:40:12,730
some kind of an oppressor,
some pressure,

2156
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,010
and that there's something that.

2157
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:19,040
So I don't know how we can deal with 
that.

2158
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:19,874
I mean was our attempt to do this was to
try to de legitimize where they get 

2159
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:26,600
their knowledge from,
like what they call knowledge,

2160
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,473
what they could point to.
We tried to say it's not knowledge and 

2161
01:40:29,541 --> 01:40:30,374
de-legitimizing,
but we really do need to get back to 

2162
01:40:32,751 --> 01:40:33,584
some kind of productive discussion,
productive politics where the far right 

2163
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:39,613
disown they're lunatics and we disown 
are lunatics and we get back to work 

2164
01:40:43,221 --> 01:40:46,280
about whatever the oceans,
plastic,

2165
01:40:46,281 --> 01:40:47,114
whatever it is that we're talking about,
because right now the discourse is 

2166
01:40:49,851 --> 01:40:50,684
corrupted it.
We're not doing what we need to do in 

2167
01:40:52,911 --> 01:40:54,280
the.
These people

2168
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,890
are continuing to pump out this 
nonsense.

2169
01:40:56,891 --> 01:40:59,920
that's totally untethered reality.
It's a huge problem.

2170
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:01,390
I'm sick of it.
You're sick of it.

2171
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:03,940
We're all sick and we're sick of.
I'm sick of it.

2172
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:05,710
I've had it.
I've had it with these folks.

2173
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,760
It just doesn't seem.
It doesn't seem like it's sustainable.

2174
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:11,573
I don't think it is.
It seems like some weird thing that's 

2175
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:14,464
going to run out of energy towards 
eating itself constantly eats itself 

2176
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:18,304
like we did.
The thing about the the people of color 

2177
01:41:19,961 --> 01:41:22,810
and the black indigenous people of color
that they fragmented.

2178
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:25,510
You see when you get into the critical 
race literature that it's like,

2179
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,550
okay,
so you're brown or black,

2180
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,533
but you have slightly lighter skin,
slightly darker skin is slightly darker 

2181
01:41:30,401 --> 01:41:31,234
than that.
Really dark.

2182
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:34,210
They have different levels of privilege 
and it's just cutting things apart.

2183
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:38,190
The idea though that this is going to 
create some kind of a coalition that can

2184
01:41:38,191 --> 01:41:42,520
then defeat the plurality or something 
like that is ridiculous.

2185
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:45,670
So what do you see?
You see this stuff starting to blow up.

2186
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,990
You see the democrats bleed seats.
They've lost lIke a thousand legislative

2187
01:41:49,991 --> 01:41:52,740
seats across the u.
S since obama got elected in [inaudible]

2188
01:41:52,741 --> 01:41:53,574
eight.
How are you going to get your agenda if 

2189
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:58,180
you don't have any legislators,
if you don't have anybody elected,

2190
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,390
and so then what happens?
Two thousand 16.

2191
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:02,563
I don't.
I can't say that the reason that trump 

2192
01:42:03,761 --> 01:42:06,220
got elected because there's lots of 
reasons it had something to do.

2193
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:07,343
No,
I will say I had something to do with 

2194
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:09,184
this because every conservative person I
know that's not just a reactionary is 

2195
01:42:12,521 --> 01:42:14,550
like.
And I live in the soUtheast man.

2196
01:42:14,551 --> 01:42:15,650
I,
I know some conservatives,

2197
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:17,470
most of my friends who are 
conservatives,

2198
01:42:17,471 --> 01:42:20,260
because I don't have a choice if I want 
to have friends that they're going to be

2199
01:42:20,261 --> 01:42:24,040
conservatives who lives there.
So I talked to them and they're like,

2200
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:26,710
oh yeah,
they're tearing down this statue.

2201
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:27,890
Oh yeah.
It's tough.

2202
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,753
And it's not like they're tearing down 
confederate statues are turning on 

2203
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:31,790
Thomas Jefferson,
you know,

2204
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:34,150
it's like there.
George Washington,

2205
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:38,080
George Washington halloween's a problem.
Then I didn't know.

2206
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,300
You didn't know how it means a problem.
What are you going as for halloween?

2207
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,510
I'm a shark.
You're a sharp.

2208
01:42:42,511 --> 01:42:44,710
My kids are mermaids.
Problematic.

2209
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,690
Oh god.
If they're mermaids and you're a shark,

2210
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:49,750
you're definitely taking like a dominant
power position.

2211
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:51,150
Power.
They.

2212
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:55,840
I don't pick my off that I have kids.
They tell me what I am.

2213
01:42:57,290 --> 01:42:58,510
Not an issue,
but I don't know.

2214
01:42:58,511 --> 01:43:02,460
I'll try to figure out a paper for that.
Halloween.

2215
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:03,620
Halloween?
Yes.

2216
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:05,520
Oh god.
Cultural appropriation.

2217
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:10,580
Why apologizes for tropic thunder?
Simple jack costume.

2218
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,120
Oh no.
He dressed up as a black person.

2219
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:13,931
You know?
Simple.

2220
01:43:13,931 --> 01:43:16,870
Jack is the mentally handicapped.
Okay.

2221
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:17,390
Okay.
That's all right.

2222
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:19,980
It's junior.
Might be the last guy ever to wear black

2223
01:43:19,981 --> 01:43:20,830
face.
Yeah,

2224
01:43:20,831 --> 01:43:21,880
that's true.
Pull it off.

2225
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:22,680
What are they?
Gonna.

2226
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,860
Pull that.
That show.

2227
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,550
What are they goIng to pull?
Tropic thunder is problematic.

2228
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:29,350
I don't even.
There's probably a tropic thunder.

2229
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:34,120
It's wonderful.
You'll love it and it's.

2230
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,180
It's special.
Highly politically incorrect.

2231
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:40,380
It's politically and writing it down.
Tropic thunder is.

2232
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:45,040
It is a fucking great move is a gem.
It's a great movie.

2233
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,870
Now we're going to be racists and 
abelist for saying that.

2234
01:43:47,871 --> 01:43:49,450
It's funny for short.
We've got real issues.

2235
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,760
We do halloween again.
Halloween is mostly,

2236
01:43:52,761 --> 01:43:53,594
It's.
There's a lot of cultural appropriation 

2237
01:43:54,471 --> 01:43:56,450
going on,
so somebody might dress up like a put on

2238
01:43:56,451 --> 01:43:58,520
a sombrero and a poncho.
That's an issue,

2239
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:03,410
especially on tuesdays.
We have tacos today.

2240
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:05,810
You know,
you can't be a native american,

2241
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:06,644
you can't be a native american.
There's that big stink just now about 

2242
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:11,900
the victoria's secret fashion show where
they had like their indigenous,

2243
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:12,753
you know,
colors and the feathers they were 

2244
01:44:14,271 --> 01:44:16,970
wearing and walking around half naked.
You can't do that.

2245
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:21,290
So the idea mostly that people are going
to take costumes that are insensitive to

2246
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:23,930
other people's cultural appropriation,
cultural appropriation.

2247
01:44:23,931 --> 01:44:27,170
So it's not dress up as Bruce Lee.
Oh man.

2248
01:44:27,171 --> 01:44:31,130
I don't know.
MaYbe for awhile for a harvard,

2249
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:32,990
maybe because he's asian and then it 
gets complicated,

2250
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:35,930
but no,
this all blew up at yale a few years ago

2251
01:44:35,931 --> 01:44:36,790
I thought for sure.
He's.

2252
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,210
Yeah.
Yeah,

2253
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:39,350
yeah.
How do you spell hIs last name?

2254
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:41,540
christakis I think christakis.
Yeah,

2255
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:43,610
sometime soon.
Yeah,

2256
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:44,750
he's supposed to.
He's a good guy.

2257
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:46,340
Um,
yeah.

2258
01:44:46,341 --> 01:44:47,174
That was hilarious.
It was kids screaming at screaming at 

2259
01:44:49,761 --> 01:44:51,340
him.
Safe place.

2260
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:54,320
Yup.
It was just his wife

2261
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:55,503
put out a email saying maybe it's okay 
to believe politically incorrect on 

2262
01:45:00,221 --> 01:45:00,960
halloween.

2263
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:01,630
It was.
Yeah.

2264
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:02,463
It was just,
you know,

2265
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:04,490
choose your costume,
how you're going to choose it.

2266
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:05,413
We're all adults.
It's probably bad to be deliberately 

2267
01:45:07,581 --> 01:45:12,581
offensive and yet it's also bad to 
overreact to incidental stuff.

2268
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:15,960
Oh yeah.
It's all this stuff.

2269
01:45:15,961 --> 01:45:17,720
You kNow,
like little girls if are white can dress

2270
01:45:17,721 --> 01:45:18,640
up as milan.

2271
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:19,850
oh,
that's right.

2272
01:45:19,851 --> 01:45:22,190
Behind us or about pocahontas is a new 
one.

2273
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:23,540
Yeah,
pocahontas problem.

2274
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:26,000
But I think Bruce Lee is still on the 
menu.

2275
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:28,250
I don't think anybody's getting in 
trouble for being Bruce Lee.

2276
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,180
You could wear it like the track suit 
where I get the treks didn't.

2277
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:36,170
That's a big footprint across my chest,
right footprint.

2278
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:40,390
We our cream of kicked in,
but a lot of people go with the.

2279
01:45:40,391 --> 01:45:41,750
Like the cutS.
oh yeah.

2280
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:42,581
The.
Oh yeah.

2281
01:45:42,581 --> 01:45:44,480
Yeah.
I don't have enough apps for that.

2282
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:47,420
That's going to be a bad costume for 
what is it is.

2283
01:45:47,421 --> 01:45:49,370
Yeah.
You could buy a Bruce Lee costume.

2284
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,680
Look for now,
for now,

2285
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:52,940
for now.
Who knows?

2286
01:45:52,941 --> 01:45:57,941
it comes with a weight to dope for now,
even a baby costume.

2287
01:45:58,431 --> 01:45:59,480
Look at that.
Look at that.

2288
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:01,700
Obviously chinese babies,
chinese.

2289
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:02,990
That's fine.
Yeah.

2290
01:46:02,991 --> 01:46:06,340
That guy's fucking guy.
No,

2291
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,400
no,
not allowed.

2292
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:10,460
Can't be a ninja.
No way to cultural appropriation.

2293
01:46:10,890 --> 01:46:15,140
a boy this,
this mess that we're in.

2294
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:17,180
Is there a light at the end of the 
tunnel?

2295
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:18,373
Nothing.
So.

2296
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:19,030
Yeah.
Yeah,

2297
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:20,290
I think so.
Uh,

2298
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,720
the response that we've got so far has 
been really positive,

2299
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:26,470
but it's all like the secret positive.
So the feeling I get is academia.

2300
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,940
Well from academics.
Yeah.

2301
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:30,850
the general public has been way more 
positive than that.

2302
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:34,960
PosItive for positive.
So the wind is changing,

2303
01:46:34,961 --> 01:46:36,580
right?
If we're getting that much,

2304
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:38,770
we've got no real blow back.
We got,

2305
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,630
we got lots of posItivity from the 
public.

2306
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:44,260
Even academics are reaching out there 
like secret positive with them.

2307
01:46:44,261 --> 01:46:45,610
It's like one more thing,
right?

2308
01:46:45,611 --> 01:46:48,400
We need a critical mass because what 
they are is they're all lined up.

2309
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:49,443
They know the first one to step out of 
line and challenged the stuff's getting 

2310
01:46:51,301 --> 01:46:53,520
shot.
So like the communist situation,

2311
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:56,040
after communism fell,
nobody really believed it anymore.

2312
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:58,140
But they had to go along with the party 
are going to get shot,

2313
01:46:58,410 --> 01:46:59,970
but if a whole bunch of people come 
forward at once,

2314
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:00,900
they can shoot everybody.

2315
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:04,680
So if feels like we're in that powder 
keg situation now,

2316
01:47:04,681 --> 01:47:08,610
right where all it's going to take is we
hoped it was going to be this,

2317
01:47:08,730 --> 01:47:09,321
you know,
our,

2318
01:47:09,321 --> 01:47:10,154
our thing was going to be the trigger 
that like 30 percent of academics come 

2319
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:12,961
forward and say,
you know,

2320
01:47:12,961 --> 01:47:15,300
it's bullshit and if enough people start
saying it,

2321
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,163
other people start feeling safe to say 
it and we wish them where people feel 

2322
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:18,901
safe,
you know,

2323
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:21,510
we took a risk,
it's been fine for us and we'll see what

2324
01:47:21,511 --> 01:47:22,344
happens to pete.
But if more people will take that risk 

2325
01:47:24,841 --> 01:47:26,760
and start speaking out,
then there's change coming.

2326
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:27,930
Now.
You were,

2327
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:31,380
you were a mathematician and that's your
background.

2328
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:36,430
And in academia that would appear at 
least to be something that is beyond all

2329
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:39,600
this stuff because it's just dealing 
with numbers.

2330
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:40,463
Yeah.
Math itself mostly has not been touched 

2331
01:47:43,201 --> 01:47:44,034
by this,
but there's this whole branch in there 

2332
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:47,010
that's called the studies of science and
technology.

2333
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:50,220
And mostly what they go after is,
you know,

2334
01:47:50,221 --> 01:47:52,830
the sciences or whatever,
especially they go after,

2335
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:53,673
um,
biology and psychology and they feel 

2336
01:47:56,281 --> 01:47:57,930
like they've got a lot of inroads into 
that.

2337
01:47:57,931 --> 01:48:01,410
We wroTe the astronomy paper to try to 
push that all the way to a hard science.

2338
01:48:01,411 --> 01:48:02,244
We've said that astronomy is sexist and 
can only be fixed by putting in queer 

2339
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:08,880
horoscopes.
they thought that was a good project.

2340
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:11,600
They keep asking them to rewrite it.
Yeah.

2341
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:14,640
They keep asking me to submit that.
I got an email yesterday asking for that

2342
01:48:14,641 --> 01:48:16,980
one again.
So even though we've come public.

2343
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:21,840
So with math mostly where you see this 
stuff hitting though,

2344
01:48:21,841 --> 01:48:22,674
they don't.
I mean some people are saying that math 

2345
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:24,564
is inherently got sexism and racism 
because I guess apparently women and 

2346
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:30,330
minorities are going to be naturally bad
at numbers is what they're assuming.

2347
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:31,320
I don't know what they're assuming does 
it,

2348
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,530
that's ludicrous.
But they mostly go after educatIon.

2349
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:35,760
So they say,
oh look,

2350
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:39,090
the scores on the sat math scores or 
whatever For,

2351
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,350
for men,
white men are higher than for,

2352
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,460
for black men or something like that.
Why could that be?

2353
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:45,031
Well,
you know,

2354
01:48:45,031 --> 01:48:46,650
maybe there are a lot of factors that go
into that,

2355
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:48,150
but they Don't give a shit about a lot 
of factors.

2356
01:48:48,151 --> 01:48:48,984
it's racism,
so therefore math education must be 

2357
01:48:51,001 --> 01:48:51,834
racist.
Therefore we need social justice 

2358
01:48:53,131 --> 01:48:56,220
initiatives in math education and that's
exactLy what they do.

2359
01:48:56,221 --> 01:48:59,100
And so then you have diversity math and 
I don't know even know what that is,

2360
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:03,000
but it's not something that you would 
see like at mathematics research level,

2361
01:49:03,001 --> 01:49:05,190
it's something that you see at junior 
high school,

2362
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:07,230
elementary school that they're teaching 
your kids,

2363
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,030
which is why it's scary as hell.

2364
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:14,970
So is there a light at the end of the 
tunnel and what do you still think?

2365
01:49:14,971 --> 01:49:16,470
There's a lot.
I think people hate this stuff.

2366
01:49:16,471 --> 01:49:18,820
I think people are getting sick.
I hate it.

2367
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:20,910
Hate it.
Hate it too though.

2368
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:22,110
But they're afraid.
Yeah.

2369
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:24,990
I had this guy come up to me repeatedly 
last week.

2370
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:26,330
This guy,
he's got two phd,

2371
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,870
brilliant guy.
He comes up to me repeatedly.

2372
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,540
What you did is so important.
It's so necessary.

2373
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:30,720
I can't talk about it.
I'm sorry.

2374
01:49:30,721 --> 01:49:32,070
I can't talk about it.
I wish I could talk about it,

2375
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,330
but I talked to a lot of academics and 
everybody's saying the same thing.

2376
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,930
They know you got them.
It's only a matter of time now.

2377
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,840
One more event and theY shake off the 
fear.

2378
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:46,710
I think it's close.
I don't knoW what the next event is.

2379
01:49:46,711 --> 01:49:50,800
I don't think it's more bogus papers.
I think it's probably somebody's getting

2380
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:52,900
fired that didn't deserve it or 
something like that.

2381
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:57,250
One more thing and people are going to 
be ready to shake this off it.

2382
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:59,980
Why does this ideology,
in fact,

2383
01:49:59,981 --> 01:50:04,981
tech companies and it seems to get them 
more than it gets anyone else.

2384
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:08,260
We should ask them more that I don't 
know.

2385
01:50:08,730 --> 01:50:10,030
He's.
He's fucked.

2386
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:12,730
If I can't get a job.
He just gone.

2387
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:14,980
I just to him the other day,
he just gone,

2388
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:16,350
well,
don't say where he's working.

2389
01:50:16,351 --> 01:50:17,170
Oh,
definitely.

2390
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:18,500
They'll go after him.
Yeah.

2391
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,411
No,
why?

2392
01:50:19,411 --> 01:50:20,244
It's in tech so much.
Maybe there's some kind of silicon 

2393
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:26,310
valley connection there or whatever 
where you know silicon valley is in,

2394
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:28,770
you know the kind of bay area,
California.

2395
01:50:28,771 --> 01:50:29,604
You've got a lot of the liberal hippie 
stuff that started out as you were 

2396
01:50:31,411 --> 01:50:32,940
talking about in the sixties and 
seventies,

2397
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:35,850
so it's kind of in the water there in 
general.

2398
01:50:35,851 --> 01:50:37,710
I would say that what you're seeing is 
that this stuff,

2399
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:42,750
as they've got the big turn to making 
this applied was in the nineties.

2400
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:43,943
Right?
So they've had an entire generation of 

2401
01:50:45,391 --> 01:50:46,224
students that have just been really 
getting this stuff crammed down their 

2402
01:50:48,421 --> 01:50:49,254
throat.
They really have taken over the 

2403
01:50:50,371 --> 01:50:51,204
education in the last 10 years.
It was just starting when I left 

2404
01:50:53,041 --> 01:50:56,090
academia in 2010 that,
you know,

2405
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:56,641
it was like,
oh,

2406
01:50:56,641 --> 01:50:58,830
we're going to focus on diversity.
We're in a diversity committee,

2407
01:50:58,890 --> 01:50:59,723
commitments,
what's going to get into general 

2408
01:51:00,481 --> 01:51:01,314
curriculum.

2409
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:04,710
So you're getting more and more students
that are getting educated in this,

2410
01:51:04,711 --> 01:51:06,210
that is now going out into the 
workplace.

2411
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:08,970
Right.
So if half your workforce in tech,

2412
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:09,833
Because tech moves so fast,
I'm just guessing why this might be a 

2413
01:51:12,031 --> 01:51:13,560
thing.
Tech was really fast,

2414
01:51:13,561 --> 01:51:16,560
so you've got to have some fresh 
training go in there.

2415
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:17,543
If they've been educated with diversity,
stuff's crammed down their throat the 

2416
01:51:19,831 --> 01:51:23,070
whole time and there's huge initiatives 
to try to,

2417
01:51:23,071 --> 01:51:23,904
you know,
increase representation of women in 

2418
01:51:24,931 --> 01:51:29,070
particular in,
in tech and these are seen as,

2419
01:51:29,071 --> 01:51:31,920
you know,
automatically good initiatives.

2420
01:51:31,921 --> 01:51:33,840
If there has been,
this is the culture that they're,

2421
01:51:33,841 --> 01:51:34,674
that they're being educated in,
and then they take that culture to the 

2422
01:51:37,681 --> 01:51:39,930
workplace and think this is what tech is
about,

2423
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,690
and then they're surrounded by 
likeminded people who encourage it.

2424
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:43,883
It's totally plausible that which you've
got to sort of a tech echo chamber 

2425
01:51:46,291 --> 01:51:49,020
that's bouncing these things around and 
keeping it,

2426
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:49,973
keeping it there.

2427
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:54,880
Here's another question.
Why is it that,

2428
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:56,380
I mean,
here's,

2429
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,700
here's,
here's the scenario,

2430
01:51:57,701 --> 01:51:58,534
right?
The scenario is universities are almost 

2431
01:52:00,521 --> 01:52:03,760
predominantly taught by people that are 
on the left.

2432
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:06,600
It's massive.
It's in the 90 percent range,

2433
01:52:06,601 --> 01:52:07,434
right?
when you have this sort of environment 

2434
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:17,791
of these nonsense ideas that are 
accepted as fact and taught and put into

2435
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:23,920
published papers,
then you have a situation where the left

2436
01:52:23,921 --> 01:52:24,754
routinely attacks itself and and,
and devours Itself for not being left 

2437
01:52:30,131 --> 01:52:30,964
enough.
You're always having people that are 

2438
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:34,630
upset that someone's not progressive 
enough,

2439
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:37,000
leftwing people attacking leftwing 
people.

2440
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:39,040
You do not see that on the right.

2441
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:39,781
No,
you did.

2442
01:52:39,781 --> 01:52:41,820
That's kind of what the whole tea party 
movement was.

2443
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:43,163
Right,
but they didn't do it in the academic 

2444
01:52:44,221 --> 01:52:46,760
field because they didn't power there 
because they weren't academics.

2445
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:47,210
right?
Well,

2446
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:48,043
yeah.
That shift started in the sixties and 

2447
01:52:49,161 --> 01:52:49,994
seventies.
They started bringing in these field 

2448
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:53,780
when that was during the obama 
administration,

2449
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:54,663
so that's when.
What was the biggest fear for every 

2450
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:57,014
republican congressman then was that 
they're going to get primaried from the 

2451
01:52:58,731 --> 01:52:59,564
right,
so they were going to have some 

2452
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:03,320
populist.
Yahoo goes screaming about whatever they

2453
01:53:03,321 --> 01:53:05,540
scream about.
It was going to be more to the right,

2454
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:07,730
harder conservatism,
conservative movement,

2455
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:10,220
capital c,
capital m kind of thing,

2456
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:11,870
and they're going to just drill into 
the,

2457
01:53:11,871 --> 01:53:13,310
you know,
the reason that,

2458
01:53:13,330 --> 01:53:14,163
that the conservative politics aren't 
succeeding is because we're not 

2459
01:53:16,641 --> 01:53:18,460
conservative enough,
is that's the,

2460
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:21,380
the prevailing view where I live in the 
southeast.

2461
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:23,960
so same thing as you see in the 
universities,

2462
01:53:23,961 --> 01:53:26,300
but reversed in terms of,
of polarization.

2463
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:28,023
So,
but isn't thAt just an excuse for the 

2464
01:53:29,331 --> 01:53:31,670
lack of success?
It is.

2465
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,553
It's,
it's a,

2466
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:37,710
it's within excuse combined with a 
commitment to the ideology,

2467
01:53:37,821 --> 01:53:39,650
whether it's conservative movement 
ideology,

2468
01:53:39,651 --> 01:53:42,230
whether it's a social justice 
scholarship,

2469
01:53:42,231 --> 01:53:44,420
whatever it happens to be.
Right.

2470
01:53:44,421 --> 01:53:49,280
But you see far more of these left on 
left attacks they need do write on right

2471
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:50,780
attacks you do right now.
Yeah,

2472
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,780
certainly.
Except of course for election time,

2473
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:57,440
certain people were trying to beat their
opponents.

2474
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:58,371
Sure,
sure,

2475
01:53:58,371 --> 01:53:59,510
sure.
It just,

2476
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:02,480
it seems to be that there's somehow or 
another related.

2477
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:03,403
I mean I would like to look at how many 
people on the left will attack others 

2478
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:13,100
for not being progressive enough,
not being left enough.

2479
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:15,050
So I think it's a panic,
rIght?

2480
01:54:15,051 --> 01:54:16,940
You see this is the kind of behavior you
see in a panic,

2481
01:54:16,941 --> 01:54:18,380
a moral panic,
for example.

2482
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:19,543
And so helen and I,
the third person who worked on the 

2483
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:23,474
project with us,
helen and I wrote an essay about a year 

2484
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:26,773
and a half ago and talking about how the
extremism on both sides is really the 

2485
01:54:29,721 --> 01:54:32,420
problem and most people reject it and 
should fight it.

2486
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:34,850
Most of us are sensible people in the 
middle who hate this.

2487
01:54:34,851 --> 01:54:35,684
In fact,
data just came out showing that it's 80 

2488
01:54:37,161 --> 01:54:40,070
percent of the population,
the fringes,

2489
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,083
both sIdes.
So n only eight percent are on the left 

2490
01:54:43,221 --> 01:54:45,140
and 12 percent are on the right of the 
fringe.

2491
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:49,030
However that works out.
And so we wrote this thing and we said,

2492
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:49,923
what's going on?
Actually we called it existential 

2493
01:54:51,921 --> 01:54:52,754
polarization.
So you have this idea that everything's 

2494
01:54:56,871 --> 01:54:59,600
an existential crisis.
So the the far right,

2495
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:02,450
we'll start with them,
sees that if the democrats get power,

2496
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,680
oh,
it's open borders.

2497
01:55:03,681 --> 01:55:05,030
The terrorists are coming in.

2498
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:06,890
Our entire way of life is going to be 
destroyed.

2499
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:08,690
Catastrophe,
catastrophe,

2500
01:55:08,691 --> 01:55:09,710
ono,
judith butler's,

2501
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:14,600
you mean 95 genders?
Quick stop the democrats no matter what.

2502
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:16,790
And then you have the left.
Oh my god,

2503
01:55:16,791 --> 01:55:18,980
if they get power that everything's 
going to be racist,

2504
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:20,720
we're going to be beating gays in the 
snow.

2505
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:24,080
It's going to just be the worst thing.
That's actually kind of a joke,

2506
01:55:24,081 --> 01:55:25,620
but,
but it's,

2507
01:55:25,650 --> 01:55:26,483
it's for real though,
that they think that the world is going 

2508
01:55:27,901 --> 01:55:28,734
to fall apart.
If the other side it gets power and so 

2509
01:55:30,081 --> 01:55:30,914
when you have that kind of a situation,
you have a panic and you see the 

2510
01:55:33,231 --> 01:55:34,064
slightest bit of advantage happening on 
the other side is just something to 

2511
01:55:36,321 --> 01:55:38,900
completely freak out about.
And then what do you do?

2512
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,033
You say,
oh well the only possible recipe to 

2513
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,800
balance the scales to turn further our 
way.

2514
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:46,350
If we go toward the middle,
that puts the balance.

2515
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,860
SaY if the right goes really far right 
and we on the left,

2516
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:52,110
moved toward the middle.
Now the whole balance has moved,

2517
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:52,944
right?
So the only way to keep the balance 

2518
01:55:54,211 --> 01:55:56,280
close to the middle is if they go right,
we go left,

2519
01:55:56,510 --> 01:55:58,170
right?
Right.

2520
01:55:58,171 --> 01:55:59,280
So then that's going to keep the 
balance.

2521
01:55:59,281 --> 01:56:01,950
But what that actually does is it.
This is going to get nerdy.

2522
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,903
Hang on.
That actually puts all of the weight on 

2523
01:56:05,191 --> 01:56:07,350
the outsides and you think about a 
spinning thing,

2524
01:56:07,351 --> 01:56:09,840
right?
It's got centrifugal forces happening.

2525
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,970
What's that trying to do is going to rip
the spinning thing apart?

2526
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:13,013
Well,
if you have all the weight crammed in 

2527
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:15,000
the middle,
like wheel,

2528
01:56:15,001 --> 01:56:15,834
it doesn't come apart right now.
imagine if you had like two billiard 

2529
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:19,524
balls and you have like this big long 
stick and there's two holes for the 

2530
01:56:22,891 --> 01:56:23,370
builder bars.

2531
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:24,840
They don't go in it like locked in 
there,

2532
01:56:24,841 --> 01:56:26,250
just sitting there.
You spend that.

2533
01:56:26,251 --> 01:56:27,600
What's going to happen there?
Fly right off,

2534
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:28,434
right?
So if you have all the weight on the 

2535
01:56:29,251 --> 01:56:30,084
outside and you start spinning a thing,
so that's like the political 

2536
01:56:31,711 --> 01:56:32,544
conversations.
That dynamic is going to rip the thing 

2537
01:56:33,901 --> 01:56:35,550
apart.
The more weight gets to the outside.

2538
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:36,623
So one side go into the fringe doesn't 
mean the other side should go to the 

2539
01:56:40,051 --> 01:56:41,910
fringe.
That's how you tear a nation apart.

2540
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:43,493
That actually makes a lot of sense.
If you can conceptualize it like an 

2541
01:56:45,481 --> 01:56:47,910
object.
There's really a damn good youtube video

2542
01:56:47,911 --> 01:56:50,490
floating around out there where somebody
takes a jet of water in,

2543
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:51,324
spins a skateboard wheel until the 
centrifical force gets so high from it 

2544
01:56:54,511 --> 01:56:56,040
spending so fast,
it rips it apart.

2545
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:57,173
It's it's worth looking up.
I don't know what the hell you'd search 

2546
01:56:58,781 --> 01:56:59,614
to find it,
but it's a powerful visual and you can 

2547
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:04,500
see it as stuff moves to the outside.

2548
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:05,363
The centrifical force goes up and up and
up until finally the thing that the 

2549
01:57:08,461 --> 01:57:11,130
structural integrity of the thing that's
spinning can't hold itself together.

2550
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:12,660
Anyone it rips apart.
Well,

2551
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:16,020
listen gentlemen and a shout out to your
friend.

2552
01:57:16,021 --> 01:57:17,040
What is her name?
Nine.

2553
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:17,820
Uh,
oh,

2554
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:18,840
helen.
Helen.

2555
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:19,900
Oh,
Helen Rose.

2556
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:22,360
Rose across the pond.
Um,

2557
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,540
thank you guys for doing this.
Really appreciate it.

2558
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:25,670
Thanks for being here,
man.

2559
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,770
I appreciate your support because we 
need support.

2560
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:31,650
We can't do this without support,
so thanks for having us.

2561
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:33,060
My pleasure.
Thanks for doing it.

2562
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:35,580
Where can people see these things?
Where can they read them?

2563
01:57:35,730 --> 01:57:39,390
The best place to go is going to be to 
go to our film makers youtube page,

2564
01:57:39,391 --> 01:57:44,391
mike naina on the youtube that just a n 
a n a y and a and a y and so on.

2565
01:57:45,901 --> 01:57:47,610
His youtube pages,
some videos.

2566
01:57:47,611 --> 01:57:48,444
He's kind of playing with the footage 
that he's collecting for the 

2567
01:57:49,681 --> 01:57:50,514
documentary.

2568
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:51,383
On top of that though,
if you go to the video we originally 

2569
01:57:53,251 --> 01:57:54,390
released,
which is on the page,

2570
01:57:54,391 --> 01:57:55,224
you can find it easily.
There's the link to the google drive is 

2571
01:57:57,331 --> 01:57:59,960
linked to all of the documents we put 
out winters.

2572
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:03,360
We explained what every paper does,
why we wrote it,

2573
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:05,520
what we were trying to show with writing
the papers,

2574
01:58:05,521 --> 01:58:10,380
what the problem is that we need to 
address and what you know,

2575
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:13,740
what we think that this shows and what 
we can do.

2576
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:16,260
It's all accessible through his youtube 
channel.

2577
01:58:16,270 --> 01:58:17,103
We're kind of making that a central hub 
and so people can go there and explore 

2578
01:58:19,981 --> 01:58:21,990
and watch some more videos of us and 
we'll.

2579
01:58:21,991 --> 01:58:23,550
Thanks for beIng here.
This was a lot of fun.

2580
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:25,970
Again,
I really appreciate what you guys do and

2581
01:58:26,010 --> 01:58:26,990
thanks man.
Thank you.

2582
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:31,060
Bye everybody.
Thank you.
