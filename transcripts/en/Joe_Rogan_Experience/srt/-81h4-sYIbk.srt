1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,580
Five speeches.
She already three,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,080
two,
one.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,800
Yeah.
I don't know who makes this weed,

4
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,950
but fuck you.
Whoever it is.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,730
Some strong might say this is some Ed 
Rosenthal.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,120
Wheat Grass.
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,560
We went deep.
He went to the deep end of the pool.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,610
Dude.
Dude,

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,130
dude,
dude,

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,330
dude,
just back from Brooklyn.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,193
So we would recap this,
but before I want to congratulate Eddie 

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,160
Bravo and becoming five foot nine and 
it's huge.

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,950
The modern medicine.
Big Difference between five,

14
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:35,610
eight and tell me about it.
I'll kill you.

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,720
Can Tower over people who are compressed
discs.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,673
You literally get.
I mean when you look at old people and 

17
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,340
they're all fucked up like that,
that's really what's going on.

18
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:46,040
They're shrinking because their disc 
tissue,

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,923
the Chinese,
the Chinese say you're as old as your 

20
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:48,740
spine.
Oh,

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,460
electronics people.
That makes sense.

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,200
It's true.
They say cool shit.

23
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,190
I like fortune cookies.

24
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,960
Just attributed a billion people.
As I got a billion people say it's.

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,510
It came from somewhere and try to from 
one guy I ordered a laptop and a.

26
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,350
I got the package and it came straight 
from China and it just sinks.

27
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,090
It sinks in,
you know,

28
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,750
especially when you get something that's
from a country like China,

29
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,660
like there's only one reason why they're
making something in China.

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,580
There's one reason,
well there's two reasons.

31
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:18,414
One,
because they'd make a lot of things 

32
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,540
there,
so the manufacturing tolerances are very

33
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,900
high.
They make when iphones,

34
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,860
things along those lines,
but also because you know,

35
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,960
people are going to work for cheap and 
lived there.

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,590
Like when you get a laptop,
like there's a real thing you do,

37
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,880
will you like,
you know,

38
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,610
you don't want to live the way that 
people who made this live.

39
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,730
Right,
but you're going to get it anyway.

40
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,563
I'm going to get it anyway in any way 
because you can go one click on the 

41
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:43,430
apple store and sensors.
It's fucking weird.

42
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,370
Works though.
Seven cents to make your last name.

43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,840
China.
China's actually,

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,710
because they've made so much money now 
they're workers are demanding way more,

45
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,100
you know,
sort of higher salaries also like better

46
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:57,090
work,
natural bed.

47
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,420
Guess what?
Guess what's going on now for the day,

48
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,950
but they're losing jobs now.
A lot of Chinese manufacturers are gone.

49
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,110
You're now got to go to South America 
and Malaysia and we got to Vietnam.

50
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,760
We can.
These guys would work for even less.

51
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,653
So.
Chinese workers are losing jobs to 

52
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:16,320
fucking Malaysians and the economy.
He's led apple.

53
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,260
They run such a tight ship.
They had put nets down.

54
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,100
So many of the workers were committed 
suicide nets.

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,030
Yeah.
To company called Foxconn.

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,373
Foxconn is the company that makes all of
the laptops and they make a gang of 

57
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,700
apple products.

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,900
I think they make phones to,
to to make a bunch of shit,

59
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,430
but they literally have nets are on the 
roof and here's the best part.

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,870
So many people committed suicide that 
they had to address it and they their,

61
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,380
their,
their argument was,

62
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,450
well,
you have to understand these people live

63
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,284
here.
So if you look at the number of people 

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,680
in consider it like a population.
The suicide rate is very similar.

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,030
Wait a minute,
you can play with stats.

66
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,830
They live in the factory basically just 
slave slaves.

67
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,360
Slaves were slaves.
Have you ever noticed later,

68
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,190
but they're getting an

69
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,710
iphone stick getting money.
They're getting money.

70
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,400
They can leave when they want money in 
the concentration camp.

71
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:06,640
So no,
they didn't.

72
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,240
They definitely didn't get money in 
concentrated.

73
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,020
You don't.
You don't have to be there.

74
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,854
You can leave whenever you want,
but this is all they're going to give 

75
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,314
you and you're going to work 16 hours a 
day or whatever the fuck did you ever 

76
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,410
know that's legit slaves.
No matter what.

77
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,160
Would you want pennies.
That's real.

78
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:29,161
Slavery and I phones come from this.
Are you sure that you got here?

79
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,870
How do we allow that?
Here's the question,

80
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:35,704
right?
What you want your mom to be working 

81
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,670
there?
Would you want your wife to be working?

82
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,950
But what it means,
that's all she could do.

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,060
She could just put together and that's 
what she's going to.

84
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,100
A dollar a dollar an hour is better than
no money in our Joe Rogan is.

85
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,880
Yeah,
you're right.

86
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,390
You're right.
You definitely right.

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,490
And,
and by the way,

88
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,893
what's interesting about China is that 
they do have a huge middle class as a 

89
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,274
result of their industrialization and 
all the suffering they went through in 

90
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,730
the eighties,
nineties,

91
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,110
they,
you got what?

92
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,440
$400,
million middle class workers now who are

93
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,441
buying things like cell phones and flat 
screen tvs and all kinds of stuff.

94
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,930
You know what's fascinating to me though
is that when was,

95
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,793
if you,
and I'll wait for when you can tell me 

96
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,330
when was the last time you bought 
anything made in Russia,

97
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,880
like wow,
that's a good point.

98
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:26,650
But just if you could please just vodka 
vodka socks and we don't.

99
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
And by the way,
I don't know if it sucks,

100
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,140
but we,
we don't have,

101
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:32,974
we use the American Swedish Baka being 
paid off by Bella tour before this fate 

102
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:38,420
or event.
Somewhat.

103
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Some anti marketing strategy fate or 
Russia of doom.

104
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,330
They're basically a one crop economy 
man.

105
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,440
They make great box oil,
you know,

106
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,630
isn't that nice?
Well,

107
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:52,920
they were held back for so long,
like communism doesn't fucking work.

108
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,980
Kids,
it doesn't work.

109
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,500
And here's the little dust that either 
as a monarchy,

110
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,440
which it is now with bizarre like Putin,
you can't,

111
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,274
your private property means nothing 
because the government can come along 

112
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,860
and go,
uh,

113
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,320
did you say something about me will take
that over?

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,090
Let's take them over and throw him in 
jail,

115
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,924
and so he was going to open a business.
What about first don't let make and God 

116
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:15,220
makes first bro,
and it's supposed to stay on the animal.

117
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,870
Thank you.
Piece of shit.

118
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,523
Supposed to stay on the animal.
That's called virtue signal that you've 

119
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,240
got that.
Great.

120
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,770
The population are very disciplined 
people.

121
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,604
It's a.
it's a.

122
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,473
it's actually a really colorful culture 
that created a lot of art and the 

123
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,093
Russians are smart people.
Everything else they are and they 

124
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:38,160
produced a thing.
I'll tell you what,

125
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,830
I'll tell you what they produce 
motherfucking ass kickers.

126
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,664
Yes they did.
They got some serious ass kickers come 

127
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,920
out of Russia.
Who's running boxing right now?

128
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Good Nautica,
Lufkin surgery.

129
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,720
Koval live says,
I thought search.

130
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,620
I love Andre Ward,
but I thought surgery.

131
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,020
Kovalev won that fight.
He dropped them.

132
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,190
Me Constantly

133
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,930
press the attack.
I just didn't think that.

134
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,100
I didn't even think it was that close.
I was really sweating the Soviet.

135
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:03,934
The Russians are so macho.
The Russians are matched their 

136
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,554
patriarchal society.
So if you think about food and he hunts 

137
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:09,990
tigers.
He's on the,

138
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,750
on the,
on horseback with his shirt off.

139
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,321
He,
by the way,

140
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,390
I have to say this because people always
correct us,

141
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,253
like Loma Cenk goes from Ukraine,
different close as it obviously you see 

142
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:20,894
that,
but that's like saying Canada and 

143
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,720
America.
It's so close,

144
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,440
but it's not.
It's North America.

145
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,920
Bad motherfucker who's skating up in 
Canada,

146
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,754
some unbelievable hockey player.
Do you consider American say North 

147
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,520
American?
You consider him as a guy?

148
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,820
He's a Goddamn Canadian.
You know he is going to kick your ass.

149
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,350
He's.
He's over here to play hockey.

150
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:37,160
Better.
More,

151
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,120
more importantly,
sir,

152
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
off of Wayne Gretzky.
More importantly,

153
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,340
don't forget that the Ukraine and Russia
proper,

154
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,250
it was annexed by the Soviet Union,
the Union of,

155
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,870
but it was essentially Ukraine has 
always considered themselves sort of not

156
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:51,620
part of the Kremlin.

157
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,400
They've always considered those own 
country and I would remind people that a

158
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,190
guy,
nice guy named Joseph Stalin,

159
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,433
a starved the Ukraine and about eight 
and a half million people died of 

160
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:08,060
starvation because he essentially 
collected forcefully,

161
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:08,894
collected all of their crops and for a 
thousand reasons and they all about 

162
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,360
eight and a half million people 
scenario,

163
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,223
but the size of the Midwest.
United States is like a Goddamn history 

164
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,930
teaching.
Great on fucking video series.

165
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,040
Oliver Stone,
the uh,

166
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,953
what is it?
The something's history of the United 

167
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,703
States,
a secret history of the United States 

168
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,410
that what it's called,
something.

169
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,440
It's fucking amazing.
I don't watch this.

170
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,343
You know,
Oliver Stone is a real history fanatic 

171
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,370
and he,
I mean,

172
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,323
it must have been exhausted.
The untold history of the United States 

173
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,130
is that it sounds like literacy to me,
Eddie.

174
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,890
It's Fuck Eddie.
You want to look at conspiracies,

175
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:46,724
like,
look at the way the world really works 

176
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,880
and forget all the nonsense.

177
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,863
This,
this is fucking fascinating and all 

178
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,190
proven,
all.

179
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:58,250
Like you could watch the videos of the 
people saying what they're saying.

180
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,920
You could see what happened after World 
War Two,

181
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,940
like,
oh,

182
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,773
what's one thing?
People out just just horrific fucking 

183
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,584
history that we have in the world of 
people just going into other countries 

184
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:15,440
with their armies and killing groups of 
people and just the amount of times that

185
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,274
it's happened over the history of the 
United States when Oliver Stone is like 

186
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,550
laying it all out with the footage.
Damon told history,

187
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:23,384
the United States,
so fucking fat Americans taken over 

188
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,370
everybody taking over everybody.
It's Hitler.

189
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,060
When Hitler was pushed into Poland,
when Hitler was in Africa,

190
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,220
like all these,
the whole thing,

191
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,054
it's chaos.
The history of people is the history of 

192
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:41,360
people taking over giant chunks of land 
and fucking things out.

193
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,690
We just haven't experienced that over 
here.

194
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,550
We were so young.

195
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,413
This country is souls fucking young.
It's crazy when you watch this 

196
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,800
documentary,
when you realize like,

197
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,663
oh,
this calm is like a very rare moment 

198
00:08:56,101 --> 00:09:00,380
where the ocean is still before tidal 
waves come smash.

199
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,660
Those tidal waves are going on all over 
the world right now.

200
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,583
If you're in Syria right now,
you are watching missiles flying into 

201
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:10,650
apartment buildings.
You're watching suicide bombers,

202
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,484
if you're in Afghanistan,
you're watching all kinds of chaos all 

203
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,920
out of the throughout the world.
It's just not happening here,

204
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,813
so we're being loled.
We're being called to this false sense 

205
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,600
of what a human being is.

206
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,693
Fascinating.
Also is that you to in order to 

207
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:24,904
galvanize armies,
to to go see a peak in the fear though 

208
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,930
on us into that room,
but you galvanize young arms,

209
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:41,140
you galvanize armies around what around 
ideology,

210
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,110
around things like communism is the best
way to go.

211
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,380
Fascism in is best way to go.
Christianity is the best way to go.

212
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,363
Islam is the best way to go,
and those armies have to have something 

213
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,440
they're fighting for.
So that's what's fascinating about.

214
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,500
If you read the Old Testament man,
it's literally about.

215
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:59,350
It's guys like you guys are fucking 
worshiping false idols.

216
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:01,900
I got to send the Babylonians and 
obviously the rockies,

217
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,913
you know,
destroyed the Solomon's Temple in 586 

218
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,650
BC,
which was the Jews built their temple.

219
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,690
That was their most sacred thing.
The Babylonians,

220
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:13,450
you know who they are.
They're the Iraqis that they.

221
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,490
Iraqis,
Hipaa fucking footprint.

222
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,750
A historical footprint that's so much 
bigger.

223
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,200
It's crazy.

224
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,470
The original civilization as far as 
modern historians.

225
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,090
Which uniform first?
Mathematics?

226
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,040
Yes.
Yes.

227
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,570
I'm writing for.
Is these weird.

228
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,690
It looks like an old school nails.
You know what an old nail looks like.

229
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:33,550
You ever work in a bill?
You ever do construction?

230
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,450
Uh,
no.

231
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,340
When I was a kid we did a lot of 
construction in Boston.

232
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:39,220
A lot of those buildings are really old 
and a lot of the really old buildings,

233
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,570
they have a different kind of nailing 
them.

234
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,600
It's a handmade nail.
So instead of looking like a circle with

235
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,930
like a straight line,
what they look like is like a wedge.

236
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,480
It's like a hard,
like flat.

237
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,343
It's not round at the top.
And they would say that's what the 

238
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,300
cuneiform looks like.
Pull up an old nail though.

239
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,550
Pull up an old old construction nail.
They looked like a wedge.

240
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,943
Four sides.

241
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,560
So that's what a cuneiform.
There it is.

242
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,810
See those,
those nails?

243
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,290
Well that's,
that's kind of a rotten out one.

244
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,124
There you go.
See how they looked like it looked like 

245
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,840
a wedge.
See they're,

246
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,674
they're like a little sword more than 
they are like around rounded cylinder 

247
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,680
type thing with appointment.
Oh,

248
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,880
those are all handmade to make.
Yeah.

249
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,470
Well they used to have some sort of a 
mold to it,

250
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:28,770
but you would go to a blacksmith or 
whoever the.

251
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,970
No,
those are ironman.

252
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,020
Yeah,
I would imagine they're stealing.

253
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,640
I think it's great.
I think it's copper.

254
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,690
No,
Brian,

255
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,460
trust me,
those are rusted.

256
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,020
They're old.
That's iron.

257
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,570
That's 100 percent iron.
You see all that rust on it.

258
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,180
Copper doesn't rust.
I got.

259
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,620
Those are all they have.
That's how they would make those.

260
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,620
My Dad was um,
he was,

261
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,890
my Stepdad was a architect so I got a 
lot of jobs on construction sites.

262
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,590
Like that's what I did through high 
schools to have a job.

263
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,990
Dude,
lets you know you don't want to work.

264
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,770
I'll tell you that for a week,
dude.

265
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,630
I did an in a fucking building in the 
summer.

266
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,733
So we're,
we're building this house and I'm the 

267
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,280
kid who has to carry the insulation 
upstairs.

268
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,690
Then put it in the Cox and people do 
that.

269
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,550
They don't want to listen to me.
They do not like it was bruce.

270
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,240
We'll do that tomorrow.
Yeah.

271
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,350
A lot of people would do that and you 
get it in your skin and you can't get it

272
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,580
out.
Get it your stuff.

273
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,200
Yeah,
and you have to wear a marriage class.

274
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,093
You've got to wear a mask because you're
breathing it in because as you're 

275
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:20,554
putting that stuff up,
it's flying in the air like you would 

276
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:22,954
see the light would come in from one of 
the windows and you would see like all 

277
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:26,050
these particles in the air.

278
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,520
You're like,
well,

279
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,790
it's terrific.
Look what I'm breathing.

280
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,043
The worst thing,
the worst job I ever had with tearing a 

281
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:30,694
house down in Washington dc in the 
summer and then we take it and bring it 

282
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:33,594
out to Lawton landfill and you'd have to
cart it off and then we poured the base 

283
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,360
for a bill,
like a big apartment or a building,

284
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,060
actually a house.
The base with cement and stuff.

285
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,410
You have to dig that kind of work.
I remember going there,

286
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,370
there is no fucking way I'm going to 
stay in college.

287
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,450
I'm going to figure out a way to not 
ever have to do this.

288
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,750
It was the worst shit in the world and 
you wake up early for some reason.

289
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,960
When you work construction you,
you're.

290
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,950
You're up super early and you're driving
in a truck.

291
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:00,784
Yeah.
Now stop and think about someone in 

292
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,630
China making your iphone exactly 10 
times worse,

293
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,440
10 times worse.

294
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
Living in my photo,
doing construction,

295
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,860
making the iphone.
They're just doing the same everyday.

296
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,630
The monotony.
Working with these machines,

297
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,520
they demand productivity.
What kind of food are you getting there?

298
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,413
It's got to be terrible.
If you're forced to live there and 

299
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,093
you're getting terrible food,
they're all packed together like 

300
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,500
sardines within what?
The loop for when this country.

301
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,990
We have the same thing on hog slaughter 
farms and things like that.

302
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,500
There's a routine to it.
With all those people working there,

303
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,470
I'd go crazy.
Oh my God.

304
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,100
See you all.
Dress the same.

305
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,160
Chairs are super comfortable.
That crazy.

306
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,000
Come on,
man.

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,833
I want to work there.
You would go crazy and you don't see 

308
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:42,560
Madison that like you look at suicide,
suicide nets.

309
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,413
Look at all these people stacked in 
together and these little tiny 

310
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,960
dormitories,
housing,

311
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,523
dorm rooms.
You think guys get really good at like 

312
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,560
missing the net.

313
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,733
Just you gotta just jump further.
Just run like a Jackie Chan off the top 

314
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,080
of the roof.
Stoked.

315
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,840
I bet they're trying to get a look at 
Japan who've seen the subway.

316
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,750
They push you on that.
Push people.

317
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:05,584
I've been there where they did that to 
us like we're in rush hour and I wanted 

318
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,180
to go down there to see what it was like
and you get shoved to bring that up.

319
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:18,181
You'll see the film in one day.
They paid dudes in uniforms to shove you

320
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,270
in like a for real.
This is happening right now.

321
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:23,770
I hadn't happened to me.
It was just.

322
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,850
I was like,
well,

323
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,823
you know what's amazing is how uniform 
people's behavior is in Japan and how 

324
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:37,471
like people are so polite and calm and 
they get along well in Japan they had to

325
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,920
because a lot of people in a very small 
area.

326
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,880
We feel the next trade was done.
Guys trying to push people.

327
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,800
Is there a similar train come and run 
up?

328
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,570
They can't.
They can't have any more trends.

329
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,300
This is every day one push.
Push that fucker get in there.

330
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:58,301
You start dating your motherfucking so 
ridiculous right now in Japan.

331
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,030
Imagine if you are preparing of so 
that's just not in their pants.

332
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:05,864
Every time they ride on that thing,
can't wait to get published in Japan 

333
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,243
where you get a lot of guys who rubbed.
The big difference is that China or 

334
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
Japan?
Japan.

335
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,830
Japan is like incredibly populated but 
really small,

336
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,083
but I think Japan did we decide to do.
We measure that is the most $5 million 

337
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,053
and it's very small.
Camp people die on the side of New York 

338
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,610
City and skip on Japan like I dunno how 
big Japan is.

339
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:33,170
How I might've made that up.

340
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,860
It's not the size of New York.
Tokyo is the size of New York City.

341
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,290
Right,
but Japan itself in California,

342
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,150
how big is it?
That makes sense,

343
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,013
but it's an hour or two.
There are a lot of their different 

344
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,120
Tokyo.
Thirty 5 million people though.

345
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,080
He swept that stacked into this little 
spot and they're super orderly.

346
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,290
8 million.
When Curtis Lemay was firebombing Tokyo,

347
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,340
I believe about 8 million people in 
about eight days died from fire.

348
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,280
I think it was 8 million or maybe it was
a million,

349
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,370
but I don't get shit in the Oliver Stone
things.

350
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,210
What happened in Russia?
That's the dark.

351
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,313
What happened?
Twenty 7 million people died in World 

352
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,980
War II.
Twenty 7 million people,

353
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,230
man,
and it's very rarely discussed.

354
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,490
And then how many Russians died?
Two and then they had stolen the next 10

355
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:17,560
years.
They last.

356
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,394
Yeah.
They had more people died in World War 

357
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,810
II than anybody.
Yes.

358
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,810
No one talks about it.
One as well.

359
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,070
Dude,
very flatland.

360
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,080
This flat area,
the Oliver Stone thing,

361
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,540
it's overwhelming.
I'm going to have to watch it like three

362
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,030
or four times and wasn't there.
This was world war two,

363
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,193
but wasn't there only a 2 million deaths
total from like that must most of them 

364
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,570
from soldiers.
Fifty dollars million.

365
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,003
Most of them were civilians.
That deaths there are about 50 million 

366
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:52,390
altogether or maybe more from a total in
the world and World War Two.

367
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,290
You know what I'm talking about?
Just soldiers though.

368
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,390
I think 2 million soldiers,
12,

369
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,130
there's probably a lot of civilian 
death.

370
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:58,964
I mean there were firebombing killed.
Most of the deaths by far were civilian 

371
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,190
according to what I saw.
I must have caught.

372
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,293
There was a lot of civilian deaths,
100 percent because there was a lot of 

373
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,030
fire bombing cities like just 
indiscriminate firebombing,

374
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,883
especially in Japan.
Like we did some horrible shit to them 

375
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:15,464
before we dropped the atomic bomb,
but even before we dropped the atomic 

376
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,910
bomb,
they were fire bombing cities.

377
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,010
You know,
they,

378
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,843
they,
they killed everybody that was down 

379
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:24,440
there.
Like the nuclear bomb itself,

380
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:28,970
like if you mean that is so crazy that 
they were willing to drop.

381
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,980
I mean this is where a war gets.
You're willing to drop a bomb on a city,

382
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,270
not a military base now,
and because we're weird because Nagasaki

383
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,210
and Hiroshima,
remember where I'm the industrial cities

384
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:44,570
that we're churning out a lot of the war
planes and there was.

385
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,110
That was where the center of their war 
machine was to remember.

386
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,050
We drop pamphlets,
we dropped my uncle,

387
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,860
my great uncle dropped the pamphlets,
the warning pamphlets saying we're going

388
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,950
to do,
we're going to fucking drive.

389
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,010
Is better surrender that here.
Yeah.

390
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,710
They gave them warning,
which that's how crazy nuclear power was

391
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,880
and meanwhile they had only blown up 
shit in the desert and you know,

392
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:05,714
and stuff in the ocean before they 
really weren't sure what was gonna 

393
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,100
happen.
We didn't know.

394
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:08,934
A lot of scientists didn't know that 
there was energy trapped in an Adam and 

395
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,163
and when we,
when they actually detonated the 

396
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,720
hydrogen bomb,
we were like,

397
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,554
wow.
All the theorizing about energy and 

398
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:20,610
anatomy.
In fact,

399
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,230
that is actually true because we just,
that's,

400
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,183
that's kind of proof positive when you,
when you see a mushroom cloud with that 

401
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,770
kind of power and you're like,
oh fuck.

402
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:32,670
We just unleashed the horrors of nature,
which is crazy because we've been in war

403
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,800
ever since we've had those things ever 
since.

404
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,080
No one's gotten to the point where that 
comes out.

405
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,820
Everybody's like,
just keep it on the edges.

406
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:39,654
Come on,
bitch.

407
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,160
Oh yeah.
There's a term for it.

408
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,700
Mutually assured destruction.
Yep.

409
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,380
Matt can be broken down into an acronym.
Yeah,

410
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,333
your boy,
Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson had a 

411
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,594
really fascinating discussion about they
couldn't really get out of the gates 

412
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,050
because they couldn't agree on what 
truth was,

413
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,300
but that was a frustrating discussion.
Very much so.

414
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:57,970
But,
but at,

415
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,803
they had a fascinating idea of there are
certain things that you could know 

416
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,950
scientifically that none of us should 
know.

417
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,023
And for example,
there are scientific truths that if we 

418
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:14,100
knew would actually result in our 
complete extinction.

419
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,121
Like what?
Like,

420
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:15,751
you know,
uh,

421
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:16,584
so,
so an example of when we found out if 

422
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,074
you split an atom,
it creates a chain reaction and a 

423
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:24,840
powerful force that can vaporize 100,000
or even a million people,

424
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:25,650
right?

425
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,630
There is potentially scientific 
knowledge like that that could have,

426
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:34,140
for example,
reduced everything that you know to dust

427
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,800
and if that's something that's actually 
something you could know,

428
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,810
is it worth knowing and would it be 
immoral to know you know,

429
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,653
that that's Kinda the,
that's where morality and science kind 

430
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:49,830
of converge and where you have an actual
conversation about certain things are so

431
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:50,664
devastating and it would be the.
It would mean the end of your entire 

432
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:57,450
existence.
So maybe that's a scientific truth,

433
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:01,740
quote unquote that isn't worth having 
even though scary.

434
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,511
Yeah.
Yeah.

435
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:05,300
But the problem is the universe doesn't 
give a fuck about that.

436
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,143
Correct.
The reality is if someone does invent a 

437
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,470
time machine and they hit that button,
we're all fucked.

438
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,300
I mean,
it really could happen.

439
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:13,920
It really is something that's,
you know,

440
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,600
within a thousand years,
whatever,

441
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,453
you have the exponential increase in 
technology and power and with what's 

442
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,400
available and what they can do.

443
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,673
It could happen percent.
That's why it's so important to have 

444
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,260
those discussions.
You,

445
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,590
that's why you know,
the atomic bomb,

446
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,470
there was a real concern that it was 
going to evaporate the entire atmosphere

447
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:29,400
of the earth.
It was,

448
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,263
it wasn't everybody,
but there was a small group of 

449
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:32,850
scientists to go,
hold on,

450
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,650
you know,
what else could happen?

451
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,340
This could kill everybody.
And they were still like,

452
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,290
we'll see what happens.
We don't think so.

453
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,130
Think about,
think about like,

454
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:43,710
think about responsibility for a 
scientist like that.

455
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,960
Think about that idea.
But how about the,

456
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,120
when they had the first nuclear reactor,
who was it?

457
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,003
Who was the Italian guy?
The father of the nuclear reactor 

458
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:52,181
though.
So,

459
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,520
and they were at the University of,
Oh fuck,

460
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,580
what was the university?
Where were the,

461
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,850
I guess the reactor started overheating.
I don't.

462
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,370
Jesus.
And they had a,

463
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,413
the,
there was a guy with a bucket there who 

464
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,300
was just going to throw a bunch of water
on it.

465
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,920
I mean it was,
I can't.

466
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:12,280
I'm Frederick Frederico,
Enrico Enrico Fermi.

467
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,570
There it is.
What a name.

468
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,890
That's what it was.
Thank you buddy.

469
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,330
And she named was in Rico University 
Chicago.

470
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,170
It started to trip out.
I would wear only handmade suits.

471
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,750
My name is Enrico Fermi,
enrico handmade shoes.

472
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,060
It was loafers with no socks.
He was a genius.

473
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,950
I think he died of radiation poisoning,
didn't he?

474
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,130
Because he might have ingested it.
Oh Jesus Christ.

475
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,890
Poor bitch.
From the time they started the Manhattan

476
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:36,724
project,
how long did it take to actually figure 

477
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:43,030
out the atom bomb?
That's also in the documentary that's in

478
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,660
the documentary because we're trying to 
figure it out,

479
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,733
man.
It was if we could split the atom and 

480
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:50,824
hit critical mass shit,
can you imagine what kind of a weapon 

481
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,540
this would be?
So it was a.

482
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,100
They hired a couple thousand scientists.
They started the Manhattan project,

483
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,170
started throwing all this money at it,
right?

484
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,270
And then the final proof was Nagasaki 
and Hiroshima.

485
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,150
That was it.
Did we pull this off?

486
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,403
And then boom,
they knew already that it works because 

487
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:15,850
they had a bunch of tests before.
Uh,

488
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,250
before they did that,
one of the most horrific thing about the

489
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,084
test was they would have soldiers run 
towards the blast because they didn't 

490
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:24,580
understand radiation back then,
which is so incredible.

491
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,260
Like they didn't understand the damage,
radiation,

492
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,900
those videos you could watch online,
Jamie [inaudible] up,

493
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,730
or they would blow this atomic bomb up.
They add up.

494
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:32,564
I'm a mock town in the distance.
They would create these mocks cities to 

495
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:35,524
see what kind of damage it would do.
They'd put up houses and Shit and they 

496
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,320
blow them the fuck up and they'd have 
these soldiers run towards the blast.

497
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,170
And the idea would be that after the 
blast went off,

498
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,040
it killed whatever.

499
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,873
People are killed and everybody else 
would be stunned and that's when the 

500
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:50,450
soldiers move in so they would fucking 
crazy towards the bottom.

501
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,470
It's the funniest video.
They're all dead.

502
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,783
They all showed up.
They think that that's what killed John 

503
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,150
Wayne soldiers running to nuclear 
explosion.

504
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,320
Yeah.
Punch that.

505
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:05,270
And that's what you just said.
Well,

506
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,993
it's like a plan.
Days after we dropped that bomb does 

507
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,340
bombs on Japan.
When Hirohito,

508
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,910
the emperor got on the radio and said,
called for the surrender.

509
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,803
One man said,
it's time for us to surrender every 

510
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:21,370
single soldier.
One of the Japanese.

511
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,890
Everyone I'm willing to die for that 
cause they.

512
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,670
They dropped their weapons and they 
surrendered it.

513
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:28,504
We took what they were so fanatically 
devoted to authority and still in many 

514
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:37,240
ways are so check this shit out man.
These fucking are sitting there watching

515
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,074
that in the distance.
I mean did that close and what's crazy 

516
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,510
is like the wind from the blast comes 
and hits them.

517
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,740
There's a bunch of different videos of 
this.

518
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,150
A lot

519
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,983
of these were the US army would document
a lot of their training episodes and so 

520
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,340
this is what they would do.
They'd get see that?

521
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,400
That's the blast from the nuclear bomb.
Look at that.

522
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,773
Fucking people are standing there in 
these trenches and there's a bomb going 

523
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,104
off in the distance.
It's so scary that they knew so little 

524
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:03,854
about what effects it would have on 
people and they let these people run 

525
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:08,234
towards their death and these people are
all running towards radiation sickness 

526
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,104
running towards cancer.
They're running towards this fucking 

527
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:17,210
mushroom cloud in the desert.
Was that the repercussions?

528
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:20,810
Like when they got home that night,
people would feel like there's a bunch.

529
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:21,644
If she'd been.
You'll never get the full fucking story 

530
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,430
as to what happened and what kind of 
health problems,

531
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,264
but John Wayne died because he was 
filming these Spaghetti Westerns in the 

532
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,263
fucking in the desert in Nevada near 
these test sites and a lot of people 

533
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:36,290
that were on the crew with them.
This might be bullshit.

534
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,120
A lot of people in the crew with them 
got cancer.

535
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,640
Look at it.
He got lung cancer.

536
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,870
No,
no,

537
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,361
no,
no.

538
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:46,050
It was the government who got lung 
cancer from smoking.

539
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,310
Yeah,
he did.

540
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,893
Everybody in the film.
There was something about everybody on 

541
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:55,820
the film that worked on that film with 
them also smoked and also to cancer.

542
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,120
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

543
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,200
How long did it take?
How long does nuclear bomb goes off?

544
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,630
Like just a nuclear bomb just went off 
before you get sick.

545
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,130
How long have you have to wait until you
could populate that area again?

546
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,983
Dozens of years.
Not necessarily going to take your 

547
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,360
Sheila knocking SOC report.
Not as bad as like nuclear waste.

548
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,000
Nuclear was the atomic bomb,
so waste.

549
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,310
It's a.
it's a different thing than the thousand

550
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,720
years it would take for that.
No,

551
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:30,810
no.
To take that long.

552
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,663
People live in Nagasaki now.
They live in Hiroshima in their 

553
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,930
factories with the nuclear waste.

554
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,883
There's definitely plants,
nuclear power plants that have nuclear 

555
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,254
waste it.
That stuff gets to like what's going on 

556
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,440
right now in Fukushima,
it's very,

557
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:46,274
very dangerous because they can't do 
anything about it yet and it's getting 

558
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,030
worse.
Like the radiation levels are higher and

559
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,720
Fukushima now than when they've been 
battling this disaster since what?

560
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,410
Two Thousand and 12,
something like that.

561
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,323
Turnover turnover is a fascinating 
example of a major nuclear meltdown and 

562
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:02,960
it's thriving with wildlife thrive.
Nuclear Wolves.

563
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,794
Yeah.
Shane Smith from vice films show out 

564
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:05,870
there.
Really?

565
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,760
Yeah.
They were fucking hunting wolves with Ak

566
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:12,761
47 commute and mute and wolves.
And read your mind Bro.

567
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,440
Don't ever play rock paper scissors with
them.

568
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,690
These fuckers know what's coming.
You know,

569
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:20,570
there's people that think that they 
never figured it out.

570
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,643
They never figured out how to make the 
atom bomb and they just basically 

571
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,040
firebombed just like they did all the 
others.

572
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,410
Those people are retarded.
There's peer reviewed papers,

573
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,460
but we were in a war.
We were in a race with the,

574
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,880
with the Nazi's to create a bomb.
We knew the Nazis,

575
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:35,714
the moon,
because there are a lot of German 

576
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:39,230
scientists came over.
I remember as as for example,

577
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,540
Einstein.
Am I getting confused here?

578
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,830
Are you suggesting that nuclear aren't 
real?

579
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,933
I don't know.
I'm just saying there's people that 

580
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,910
think no,
but they never figured it out.

581
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,773
Those people retarda 100 percent.
They ever targeted Dude Oppenheimer 

582
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,270
Oppenheimer's papers that he wrote on it
and the work that he did on it,

583
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,090
like that's all anybody could read that 
anybody can go into that.

584
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,740
It's all documented.
What they did,

585
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:03,050
the tests,
I mean they.

586
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,890
There's videos of the explosions,
there's videos of them blowing a fucking

587
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,733
hole in the ocean.
That's so insane that they had these 

588
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,124
boats,
these destroyers placed around the 

589
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:12,570
water.

590
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,403
They didn't pull that up because I 
forget what the test was with the 

591
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,800
nuclear testing.
The ocean.

592
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,970
There's videos of bombs going off.
You can see it.

593
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:24,390
It's real destruction.
Undeniable.

594
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,550
How do you know their nuclear,
not just regular bumps.

595
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,530
The difference in the destruction is 
insane to me.

596
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,680
Eddie fucking God.
Dude,

597
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,440
you're talking about a mile high wall of
water.

598
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,580
They had no idea it was so scary.
If you're a fish,

599
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,440
know they lost his fucking boat.
They're like,

600
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:44,380
well,
we'll just have this boat.

601
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:46,480
Sit around.
Look at it.

602
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,440
This.
We're getting a new monitor.

603
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,460
This monitor keeps cutting out.
I don't know what's going on.

604
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,770
Terrifying.
It destroys this fucking boat.

605
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,873
They thought they could park their 
destroyer a certain distance away from 

606
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:00,750
this nuclear bombs.
So they're like,

607
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,730
okay,
so if we drop a bomb on them,

608
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,230
how close can we be?

609
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,900
Turns out you can't even be remotely 
fucking close.

610
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,690
Check this shit.
How you see it from the sky.

611
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,550
Look at this.
Watch this.

612
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:14,370
They set up this fucking boat.
I mean,

613
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,170
when see Jamie,
what are you doing?

614
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,013
You're fast forwarding.
See if there's got to be a part where 

615
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:24,591
you can see it from distance because 
from distance it's so fucking insane.

616
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,520
That's what it looks like.
You're talking like,

617
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,070
what is that?
30,000,

618
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,070
40,000
plus feet in the air and water,

619
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:35,761
Bro.
Dude,

620
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:40,530
that's insane gas,
so the water evaporates.

621
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,830
Irregular bomb can be the way that is 
hundreds of thousands of regular bombs.

622
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,910
What they can do with these things is 
insane.

623
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,793
Crazy at Nagasaki and Hiroshima or 
little firecrackers compared to what 

624
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:56,610
they have now.
Fire fighter aircraft,

625
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:57,444
so it's just not a question whether or 
not nuclear power nuclear bombs are 

626
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:01,260
real.
There's nuclear power.

627
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,730
That's probably the reason why we're.

628
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,150
Our lights are on or that we use nuclear
power as as we speak,

629
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:09,090
but what it does make steam.
Yeah,

630
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,710
I know.
It's very clean.

631
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,663
It's very fucking hot as fuck and it 
makes steam as long as it doesn't get 

632
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:15,234
out of your little holding pen.
It's like you've harnessed a demon and 

633
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:20,720
you use that demon to make tea.
That's right.

634
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,110
Cattle,
the power.

635
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:25,944
That's so unbelievably hot.
The constantly keep water in contact 

636
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:30,030
with it.
It makes steam.

637
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:35,210
The steam powered the turbines.
The turbines make electricity gets out.

638
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Yeah.
Well a piece of uranium,

639
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:38,840
I think the size of a pencil,
you can look this up,

640
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,350
can run a nuclear for six months.
You know,

641
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,530
it's an incredible,
insane form of energy.

642
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,643
It's a demon and we're harnessing it and
a cement box and we're putting it right 

643
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:54,940
next to the ocean drive to San Diego.

644
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,773
You have a drive to San Diego and see 
the nuclear power plant there and all 

645
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,380
the nuclear bombs and that Russia had.
They still have to have.

646
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,690
That's one of the great things about 
where lost shit though.

647
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,130
There was a lot of lost material.
Nuclear Bomb,

648
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:12,310
Rosa parks and the rosenbergs soul.
No one else figured it out.

649
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,550
The American.
Did you ever hear that American story?

650
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,870
So the story.
So the.

651
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,713
The rosenbergs a husband and a wife sold
nuclear secrets to the Soviet because 

652
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,040
they were communists in this,
in this country,

653
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,190
and when they sold them,
and was it truman?

654
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,390
I think Truman put them to death in the 
electric chair.

655
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,233
They both.
They were both killed for bait for high 

656
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:35,701
treason,
but now those motherfuckers sold it to a

657
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:40,420
lot of people in India just pull my 
amount each other.

658
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,740
Remember this too,
as they're the rise math Semitism in the

659
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:45,574
thirties in Germany and certain 
scientists and Jews were getting 

660
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,083
assassinated,
beat up a lot of the German scientists 

661
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:55,150
because there was a real renaissance in 
Germany and Austria,

662
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,770
physics renaissance at with along with 
people like Albert Einstein.

663
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,410
They emigrated to the United States 
because they were like,

664
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:04,290
I don't think they liked the Jews over 
here,

665
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:08,590
and in Germany.
We benefited from that mass immigration.

666
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,290
We've talked about this guy on the,
on the podcast before,

667
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:16,291
but the biggest crazy scenario,
like ironic scenario was Fritz Haber,

668
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,413
the guy who simultaneously was winning 
the Nobel prize for being able to 

669
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,040
extract nitrogen out of the air at the 
same time.

670
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,143
They wanted to try him for crimes 
against humanity being the first one to 

671
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:31,564
gas people and he created Zyklon a,
which was this really fucking horrible 

672
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:40,720
smelling pesticide.
It was a terrible poisoned,

673
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:41,554
but it had a horrible smell to it and 
that smell let you know that it was 

674
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:44,944
there.
The Nazis took it and turned to design 

675
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,710
con be they took the smell out of it and
they use it to gas.

676
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:54,820
The Jews and this guy was a Jew himself 
and a scientist dude,

677
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:56,410
but he was a painter in the country.

678
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,000
He's a patriot.
He wanted to help his.

679
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,280
He wanted to help Germany,
his beloved country,

680
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,473
when World War One and said,
I think I can help you guys with a gas 

681
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:05,584
that will kill everybody,
a lot of people and we'll just wait for 

682
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:10,390
the wind to shift and he was a patriot 
in his mind.

683
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:12,910
He was killing the enemy who are trying 
to take over his country.

684
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:18,090
He was a Jew and then of course in 19 
while starting my God and probably 39,

685
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,370
they started using this gas.
What happened to him in the final sweep?

686
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,690
Wound up dying,
fleeing Germany,

687
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,700
and he had a heart.
He had a heart condition.

688
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,673
His life was hell man.
His wife committed suicide in front of 

689
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,310
him because of what he was doing like it
was.

690
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,283
It was off and he left his son with his 
wife's body while he went off to war to 

691
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:39,230
go do more of it because.
Right.

692
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,980
The whole

693
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,000
thing is it's.
It's just the.

694
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,050
It was a different place.
It's a different world.

695
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,953
It's not Santa Monica where you're going
to fucking starbucks and you get some 

696
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:51,820
sugar free latte.
People will always starved.

697
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,850
We had to worry about the winter and we 
have to worry about Guano.

698
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,710
We relied on Guano on bat shit and bird 
droppings close to Chile.

699
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,690
People will go to war,
get bat shit.

700
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:05,000
Do you know that?
That's where the term crazy.

701
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,920
That's where it came from.
Not In Africa.

702
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,993
People would go to these places in 
Africa to take Guano and other people 

703
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:11,444
will come from other countries.
They would go to war over this stuff 

704
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,690
because it's the best fertilizer you 
could use.

705
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:17,240
You just have to get nitrogen into the 
soil.

706
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,463
But Fritz,
Fritz Haber and his buddy and the guy 

707
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:20,834
who had perfect this came up with a way 
to get nitrogen out of the air which 

708
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:29,030
becomes ammonia and that's how you know 
drips into a liquid form.

709
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,540
This can right out of the air dude,
so we don't die of starvation anymore.

710
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,830
Modern Day farming and the reason you've
never met anybody who died of starvation

711
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,693
is because of Mr Fritz hopper.
You better start getting more grateful 

712
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,800
for real high because you're just 
laughing.

713
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:43,634
In general,
they say that 50 percent of the 

714
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:47,330
nitrogen,
50 percent of the nitrogen and the human

715
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:50,930
beings today might have come from the 
hopper method to estimate.

716
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:51,764
Shout out to harbor to hopper.
The air that you breathe in is like 80 

717
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:55,754
percent nitrogen.
We think of it as oxygen and carbon 

718
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:59,080
dioxide.
It's mostly nitrogen.

719
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,750
Yeah,
just really weird.

720
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,560
That's why pure oxygen fucks you up and 
gets you high and it's dangerous.

721
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:06,370
Right,
and super good.

722
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,760
Super flat.
When you're.

723
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,220
When you're looking in bars in vegas.

724
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,950
Everyone's trying to.
I had one Jack Shit for me.

725
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,870
Anything.
They so stupid.

726
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,850
Have you been scared?
I was.

727
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,540
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

728
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:24,820
You got to do it.
You'll never leave.

729
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:26,380
You almost died.
I went to.

730
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,873
I went to fucking look at the biggest 
nuclear explosion ever equals to 57 

731
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,810
million megatons of TNT.
You tell him he just wants to bomb.

732
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:39,544
It's like way bigger than its source.
That's in the atmosphere member who 

733
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:49,250
signed the antibody testing training and
the air atmosphere at that.

734
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,103
That's incredible.
Kennedy and the Soviet signed a pact to 

735
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:55,670
not do this in the atmosphere and what 
James is trying to toss it in the Arctic

736
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,503
Ocean.
When they did this in 1961 bomb ever 

737
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,500
tested.
God.

738
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,920
That's like the final scene in a video 
game.

739
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:06,230
When you win for them where they made 
these movies,

740
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:11,231
they made them in Hollywood at the 
lookout mountain studios.

741
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,840
You could look that this is not not made
in Hollywood.

742
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:16,680
Eddie.
This is a video of an actual bus.

743
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,330
Kennedy and the Soviet real.
I'm just saying they edit it and had the

744
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,100
biggest studio lookout.
Mountain studios.

745
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:25,934
It was a.
It was a top secret air force 

746
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,274
intelligence as the one we were talking 
about up in some dude who works at the 

747
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:34,244
video store edit it.
Who would have edited that would go to 

748
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,094
someone who is the biggest,
most advanced movie studio saying that 

749
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,150
that's fake.
No,

750
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,501
no,
no.

751
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,360
I'm just saying that they admitted it.
They.

752
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,850
That's where they put on it and they 
edit it together,

753
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,240
but they didn't change it.
They just filmed.

754
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,420
I almost died when he dropped that.
Everything,

755
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,310
everything,
everything.

756
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,770
Everything.
In any anti treat,

757
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,310
anti testing,
treated the atmospheric testing,

758
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:05,250
I can't remember how to word it,
but he looked out the window and said,

759
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:06,084
well,
we're weren't detonating these bombs in 

760
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:08,100
the atmosphere.

761
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,750
Where's that waste co?
And they were like,

762
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,060
um,
it just rains down on people.

763
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:13,050
He goes,
well,

764
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:14,710
that doesn't make any fucking sense 
because we're all.

765
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,860
When we were doing it,
the Soviets are doing it,

766
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:17,723
can we?
And that's when they signed the treaty 

767
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:19,920
not to do that anymore.
They don't,

768
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,200
they don't test nuclear weapons.
Nobody knows anymore.

769
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,223
Nobody does.
But Russia did launch some sort of a 

770
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:27,414
missile test recently.
Two Treaty apparently saw getting very 

771
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,790
scary mountains.
Very gangster gangster.

772
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,180
Well he's,
I watch house of cards,

773
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:38,040
Bro.
Pretty much get it.

774
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,490
Putin's created an atmosphere again,
you know,

775
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,440
he's just a product of symptom of the 
Russian mindset maybe.

776
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:45,630
But like I said,
he's a hard man.

777
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,840
Hard,
hard man who makes his country weaker.

778
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,110
When was the last time you bought 
anything Russian?

779
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,760
So what's going on?
You know,

780
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:55,440
I mean,
it might not be a soft time for Russia,

781
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,580
but it's a soft time for us.
Clinton.

782
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,160
Obama said something interesting,
he said,

783
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:01,710
let's just just just we can ignore 
Russia.

784
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,590
They make guns and some oil,
but their guns aren't even that good.

785
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,230
Nobody needs him.
You know.

786
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,363
Obama said that he didn't really say 
like stabbing yourself in the finger on 

787
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:15,150
the edge.
Brother.

788
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,430
I live on the air knife or definitely 
not the edge.

789
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,523
He's quoting.

790
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,373
Knife came from the Congo and it's 
probably got all sorts of diseases like 

791
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,130
justin wren probably hit that in his ass
over here.

792
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:34,380
Just stole that from a poor kids.
Gold in fucking jail.

793
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,450
Me My shift.
That's what you would use.

794
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,083
Feels like.
It feels to me like your fingers would 

795
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:40,770
slide right up on the blade.
One.

796
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,110
Good Stab and you cut your hand.
Not The way I hold her brother.

797
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,570
What do you put your thumb over the top?
First of all,

798
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:46,890
like a pen.
You go and click.

799
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:47,620
Click.
When I,

800
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,110
when I.
When I yard fight,

801
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,060
when I get into a yard.
Shanking fest.

802
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,940
I'm slicing.
I'm opening you up.

803
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,640
I'm fucking.
I'm unzipping.

804
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,440
My other friend is actually like studied
like knife fighting,

805
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,890
fighting techniques and what these guys 
do know,

806
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:05,070
I catch him video to like butter,
the slice.

807
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:08,190
You open like butter on zippy.
I'll scribe your spine from the front.

808
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,980
I kind of go,
I can't do this.

809
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:16,610
Adult opened you up to rather pay taxes.
Let's show me a video on Instagram,

810
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,860
doodling.
Look,

811
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,760
this guy dead lifting 600 pounds.
Just.

812
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,310
I'm like,
oh my God.

813
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,420
My friend John Rollo was sending me,
showing me some pictures on his phone,

814
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,283
went to lunch other day and he was 
sending me some pictures on his phone 

815
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:32,901
with his duty trains with who's a week 
just to put 100 percent natural tested.

816
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,160
Many times I'll have to see it,
homie

817
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,023
is he's dead lifting some ungodly amount
of weight like 700 pounds or some shit 

818
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,154
from behind his back behind his back 
behind himself and lifting us up and 

819
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,524
he's showing this to me and he's got.
He had 600 pounds on his back for a 

820
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:51,274
squat with no hands.
He puts his hands like this and he does 

821
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:57,760
a full deep knee squat.
Six hundred pounds resting while he's in

822
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:59,080
a prayer position.
Yeah,

823
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,770
yeah.
No hands.

824
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,603
He's just.
That guy can do with like a bar by 

825
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:03,034
itself.
This motherfucker's got like 600 pounds 

826
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,160
and squatting like this.
He's insane.

827
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,130
Big Country Fed,
white,

828
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:10,510
gray and black guy.
Giant athlete.

829
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,020
The naked gorilla to my left over here.
You said according to your brother,

830
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,990
you got to over 700 pounds.
Yeah,

831
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,100
but not.
This is one of those asshole.

832
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,450
This guy's 1:40
world records.

833
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,150
Four zero.
Oh my God.

834
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,510
He's just a freak and Rollo was telling 
me about it and he's like,

835
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:29,350
dude,
I'm telling you.

836
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,770
This guy looked breaks almost every and 
he's not like the heaviest class.

837
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,693
So sometimes he competes against people 
who are heavier than him and in those 

838
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,530
cases he doesn't lift as much or 
anything.

839
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,570
It's just really good at this saying,
I forget his name was just unbelievable.

840
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,260
Physical strength.
This is what these guys are into.

841
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:48,094
Like Mark Bell,
you know Chris Bell documentary maker 

842
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:51,970
and his brother mark from bigger,
stronger,

843
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:53,410
faster.
These fucking guys,

844
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,573
they just.
There's videos or their whole 

845
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:59,320
instagram's like videos of them pushing 
a new personal record.

846
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,333
They got their fucking elbows all 
wrapped up and everything is wrapped up 

847
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:06,040
and mark's actually get this thing 
called a slingshot that you put your arm

848
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:06,874
and it's like this thick rubber neoprene
thing that you bench in and he's 

849
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:10,534
benching 600 clapping and it's great.
It takes to get into that suit slapping 

850
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:20,644
each other which powder and chalk in the
air at all they're trying to do is just 

851
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,460
like lift heavier and heavier weight.

852
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,600
It's crazy.
I love it.

853
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,060
I take a weight lifting class now with 
from an Olympian,

854
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:33,290
you dumb fucking Venice at the Venice 
barbell holiday was.

855
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,160
I saw you try to deadlift and Austin had
died.

856
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,220
So sad.
I though.

857
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,400
Oh,
that was when he was doing like four 95.

858
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,510
That primal soldier dude,
that dude from instagram,

859
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,640
it's just ridiculous.
Kettlebell routines.

860
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:52,420
He's one of the instructors and this guy
is just stupid strong.

861
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,760
And he was dead lifted.
It was like 4:50

862
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:56,500
plus 100 pounds of chains,
right?

863
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,130
Yes,
yes,

864
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,963
yes.
So it's like 50 slash 50 if you get to 

865
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:01,000
full.
We don't really get the full chain,

866
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,200
you know,
some chain left.

867
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,140
But he's a young warrior who likes the 
chain.

868
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:09,520
It was great with that damn sap.
Do they always works out in the shortest

869
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:10,650
shorts?
No shirt on.

870
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,440
Fuck.
Like that.

871
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,350
Body double chicks around the body.

872
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,720
Now you're thinking about Juan's brother
pizzas.

873
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,980
Too much ticket.
A primal soldier.

874
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,390
That's who he is on.
There is no,

875
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:23,350
that's,
that's Eric.

876
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:26,320
I think that's the wrong dude man.
That's his brother.

877
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,570
His brother.
But one is a based.

878
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,910
His brothers.
I just saw him.

879
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,883
Oh is that the same guy?
Now I'm talking about the other guy who 

880
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,240
wears glasses.
Just go to primal.

881
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,440
Swole.
Go to go to tim level.

882
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,760
Soldier.
Go to his um,

883
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,490
his instagram page.
His view of it.

884
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,890
Noticing that like when you try to click
on instagram pictures from a Mac,

885
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:47,810
sometimes they don't open up a new 
window.

886
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,970
The kid maybe it's a different spot so 
far.

887
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,110
Yeah.
Go to the upper left.

888
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:54,190
One kid is doing because I could Ninja 
Turtle.

889
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,073
John Wolfe work me out on it when I was 
there and Austin Goddamn fucking shitty 

890
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:00,620
computer screen.
We've got to get a new TV.

891
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,570
This TV does not communicate with our 
computer.

892
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:03,404
Right,
but he does all these like flow 

893
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:07,034
exercises.
Shorts couldn't be smaller and go out 

894
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:10,940
and publish.
Shout out to short,

895
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:11,840
short,
short,

896
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,733
short,
front,

897
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,573
jacked his.
Fuck God damn stupid young warrior and 

898
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:19,490
his brother Bell Swing and stud.
Clotted up.

899
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,353
His brother.
One is the other head instructor there 

900
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:22,664
and forget it.
I would never wear a shirt with John 

901
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,470
Wolf is the shit to.
John Wolfe gave me this whole hip series

902
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:30,470
of workouts.
He gave me this hip thing.

903
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:33,920
It's all body weight exercises.
Just extending your foot forward.

904
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,963
You do like 10 reps that way and then 
you do 10 reps like as a side kick to 

905
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:38,474
the side and hold it out in the air and 
then you do 10 reps left and then 10 

906
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,960
reps right in front of you like you did.
Circles did a whole dinner with amazing.

907
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,550
Unbelievable.
Then he had me take.

908
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,840
John said,
let's just look.

909
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:48,231
Yeah.
I said,

910
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:49,820
I ask them a question about the mace,
and he goes,

911
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:51,530
yeah,
and he grabs a 15 pound mason.

912
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:52,490
I'm like,
dude,

913
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm a lot stronger than 15 pounds.
Give me a hug and bray.

914
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,110
Okay,
yeah.

915
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,233
Uh,
we did five rounds of some crazy shit 

916
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,270
and 15 pounds was simply perfect.
It was worth.

917
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,650
And I told him about.
I workout with a 25 pound club.

918
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,670
You know those Indian male clubs,
those 25 pounds steel club,

919
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,290
that's it.
Twenty five pounds.

920
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,153
That's it.
But when you're doing shit like these 

921
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,313
things,
were you swinging over your arm like 

922
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:19,940
Conan and just hold it in place.
It's phenomenal exercise and you realize

923
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,163
our biggest weaknesses,
the things that are always going bad on 

924
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:24,770
people,
and that's the connections.

925
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,050
That's not necessarily your biceps,
right?

926
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,840
It's usually like the connection between
your bicep and your shoulder,

927
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,680
your shoulder to your back,
attended our connections.

928
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,513
And when you're doing things like yoga 
and when you're doing things like these 

929
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:37,724
club bells,
we holding these big steel clubs in 

930
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,960
front of you and you're swinging them 
over your head.

931
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:42,943
You're developing like very strong 
tissue and all your shoulder joints in 

932
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:47,714
your elbow joints,
in your wrist joints because it's 

933
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,300
constantly manipulating the,
the,

934
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,090
the,
the different and it's kinetic,

935
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,720
the different weight of it.
I mean the,

936
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,613
the gravity is pulling it this way in 
that way and you have to stabilize it 

937
00:43:58,850 --> 00:43:59,683
and you're using all these weird muscles
that you don't use if you're pushing a 

938
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:05,170
nautilus machine and we're just doing 
something simple like a ranch.

939
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,093
Yeah.
You got these isolation things where 

940
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:12,590
like you're holding one thing and you're
moving it in a certain way by itself.

941
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,680
Like whether it's Kettlebell flows or 
whether it's.

942
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:16,514
I'm using steel clubs like you're 
controlling like all of your different 

943
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,150
stabilizing muscles in,
in a very unique way.

944
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,183
Holding static positions to do that one.
It's like a yoga exercise where you're 

945
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:32,040
on one knee and he had one leg straight 
out and

946
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,410
your arm straight ahead and just hold 
that.

947
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,920
I just started doing yoga and that I 
have a whole new respect for yoga.

948
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:43,340
I mean I've been doing it now three 
weeks and man it kicks my ass.

949
00:44:44,561 --> 00:44:47,740
It's an hour and at the 30 minute mark,
I'm Don.

950
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,170
I got to leave.
I walk out.

951
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,890
Have you ever been to yoga class that I 
haven't walked out.

952
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,230
Really?
Yeah.

953
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,140
It's so hard to bring ice water.
I do break down after 30 minutes.

954
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:03,450
I get crushed.
Crushed in 30 minutes.

955
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,200
It depends on how your body and then I 
laid there and it's so God damn hot.

956
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,920
It's like 110 degrees in there.
It's ridiculous to stick it out.

957
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,370
I have no choice.
I have no trust.

958
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,720
Every day I'm looking at.
It feels like you're getting it done.

959
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,520
I actually am proud of myself for going 
because that's the hardest yoga class.

960
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,220
They got a core yoga.
They got all different kinds of levels.

961
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,470
No heat at all.
Little bit of heat.

962
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,600
I didn't even know it was an accident.
It was just perfect.

963
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,250
Ten 30 in the morning,
wake up.

964
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:32,250
I just go,
go right down the street and it was just

965
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:37,251
kicking my ass from day one,
just crushing our early hang.

966
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,260
I leave there and I got to.
I'm too tired to get in the shower.

967
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,210
I was just like,
are you good with the Cold Eddie?

968
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:44,370
Can you handle the cold better than you 
hit cancel the heat?

969
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,353
Yeah,
but I want to kill two birds with one 

970
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:47,154
stone.
I want to stick it out and I want to be 

971
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:48,720
able to.
I mean,

972
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:50,200
there's old ladies that do it,
you know what I mean?

973
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,493
And they're fine and just holding,
holding your arms up and all these 

974
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:58,200
poses.
No wonder yoga chicks have big shoulders

975
00:45:58,201 --> 00:45:59,034
and triceps.

976
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,930
You're sexy.
Oh Man.

977
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:01,943
All those poses that look,
they look so easy in a picture that 

978
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:05,461
looked like,
oh,

979
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:07,260
they're doing tight.
She tried doing.

980
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,080
Try Holding your hands up for a 90 
minute class.

981
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:13,080
That should a test.
You know our your hours enough.

982
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:14,820
For me,
I do 90 minutes every week.

983
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:16,410
Sometimes I've done it three times in a 
week,

984
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,590
but I'm doing it at least once a week.
Sometimes I do.

985
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:21,270
There's a 70 minute class that they do 
there.

986
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:23,460
Sometimes it's really good because they 
don't talk at all.

987
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,570
It was just like,
you know,

988
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:27,190
it's for people that already know the 
positions just tells you what to do.

989
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,420
Go through it.
No,

990
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,100
no,
no,

991
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,900
no.
She cheats.

992
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,733
Says like begin and,
and she says what the position is to 

993
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:33,684
begin,
but none of that explaining what to do 

994
00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:36,690
while it's going on and there's a 
little.

995
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,080
There's like some,
some yoga places,

996
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:39,983
not the one that I go to,
but I've been to some when I start 

997
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,570
talking about like the mystical 
properties in this position.

998
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:48,090
This is good for the ascending colon.
No know you didn't go to medical school.

999
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,393
Did I take.
I take classes down in Venice and there 

1000
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,690
will be some awesome,
awesome.

1001
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,740
Like good looking dude who would come in
and beads and a great body.

1002
00:46:58,741 --> 00:46:59,850
He was a Yogi.
I.

1003
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,250
There's one guy,
can't remember his name.

1004
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,084
He's the greatest.
He would teach and the girls all loved 

1005
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:07,500
him and he would adjust you and I swear 
to God he would.

1006
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,020
You'd get into a position and he would 
say,

1007
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,883
and let's not fight this.
Let's just have our own relationship 

1008
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:16,450
with our own God.
And there it is.

1009
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,353
Love,
feel how much energy it does take to 

1010
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:23,661
reach to the back of the room and had a 
great voice.

1011
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:28,510
And I'd be like,
I was like,

1012
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,890
I'm with his voice

1013
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,640
to give myself over to la.
Was that I haven't been back since I was

1014
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:34,474
at this hot yoga.
I won't say where it was a 90 minute 

1015
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:39,220
class and there were,
for whatever reason that day,

1016
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:41,500
that morning,
there's just hot chicks everywhere.

1017
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,960
And it was,
this dude comes in and the girl dates,

1018
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,040
we goes,
he's strict.

1019
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,770
He's known for being strict and like,
well two yogis with relapsed.

1020
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,200
We go in there.
Oh Dude,

1021
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,600
10 minutes into it calls me out.
Brennan,

1022
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,890
eyes up front,
let's not,

1023
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,930
let's not go.
No,

1024
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:57,900
swear to God,
you know,

1025
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,360
I'm fucking balls deep.
Get My,

1026
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,520
you know,
my hamstrings.

1027
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:04,420
So it was,
it was unwarranted.

1028
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,560
Yeah,
hundred percent.

1029
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,380
And it was super embarrassing.
I was like,

1030
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,470
Hey,
call blocking.

1031
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,530
Yeah.
Hey,

1032
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:12,364
you know,
I'll punch in his face because I was 

1033
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,680
switching legs and I didn't know what 
everyone else was doing.

1034
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:18,700
I was so into it.

1035
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,470
And so I looked around to see what they 
were doing.

1036
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:21,370
He's like,
eyes up front,

1037
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,330
running,
eyes up front.

1038
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:24,610
Let's not go.
Let's not.

1039
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,473
God make me so mad because I would be 
talking with a shitty thing to say if 

1040
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:31,780
you weren't actually doing that.
Do you think he's just hating?

1041
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,090
I'm not sure what's going on.
I haven't been back.

1042
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,090
Kind of hurt my feelings.
Well,

1043
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:40,540
there was a guy that used to teach yoga 
at my place and he was like real sort of

1044
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:43,930
hardcore,
like a very like intense dude and he,

1045
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:45,970
you know,
he would teach the class was a,

1046
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,680
it was headed at a totally different 
vibe to like,

1047
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:50,650
I got along good with them,
but his vibe was different.

1048
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:51,520
You know,
his,

1049
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,220
his vibe was like,
you're like,

1050
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,290
you're gonna have to tough this out.
Military style was a little weird.

1051
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:56,831
I was like,
yeah,

1052
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,280
come on man.

1053
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,113
We're just stretching.
That's how this guy with any to calmed 

1054
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:00,730
down,
I don't want to be aggressive.

1055
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,610
And this guy was saying,
he goes,

1056
00:49:02,611 --> 00:49:03,444
uh Oh,
you can only get water when I totally 

1057
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:06,250
get water.
And he goes,

1058
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,120
once that door shuts,
no one can leave this.

1059
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,870
Did that to fucking.
I don't like that.

1060
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,060
There's a guy,
Brian cast,

1061
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:13,894
who is one of the more famous guys.
He was really smart about it because he 

1062
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:20,770
opened up his school in Los Angeles.
He studied for many years and he said,

1063
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,700
uh Oh no.
Are All,

1064
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:23,710
are welcome,
and there's no money and be like,

1065
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,580
what?
And he goes,

1066
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:28,480
just donation if you want no big deal to
have that.

1067
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,710
Yeah.
And you just donate.

1068
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:34,711
But he made millions because what 
happens is people go all the time,

1069
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,010
they're like,
it feels good.

1070
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:36,850
Yeah.
You're like,

1071
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,790
you're not even asking for money.
The class is open to everyone first come

1072
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:40,624
first serve totally democratic.
And what you do is people don't like 

1073
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:44,740
taking shit for free.
Most people,

1074
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,910
most people are like,
you know what?

1075
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:49,390
I'm going to give you a 100 foot because
I really appreciate.

1076
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,160
I would do that.
Like I,

1077
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:53,500
I give the NPR because I listened for 
free all the time.

1078
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,730
So whenever news from ketamine,
hey,

1079
00:49:57,731 --> 00:50:01,920
how bout we talk about the fights?

1080
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,670
The Bikram Yoga Guy got fucked right 
with me.

1081
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:10,680
Like trying to rub his boner on girls 
and stuff while he was alive.

1082
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,520
That yeah,
apparently on the ground in a cold,

1083
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,410
a Rolls Royce and he had a speed on.
I mean,

1084
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:18,850
I've been to is they,
uh,

1085
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,250
they asked him about it,
he says lies,

1086
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,150
lies,
lies,

1087
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:22,984
and then,
and then he said women would have paid 

1088
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:27,350
$1,000,000
for one drop of my sperm.

1089
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,010
And The

1090
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,910
lady was like,
what?

1091
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,680
He goes,
one drop of my sperm,

1092
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,010
$1,000,000.
And he was just saying that they're,

1093
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:37,100
they were liars and the salt nonsense,
he was a bad ass.

1094
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,650
His wife was shit.
He drove around in a Rolls Royce.

1095
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:41,450
He made millions of dollars.
He would.

1096
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,360
He was the one who came up with hotbox 
yoga.

1097
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,073
Yoga,
right?

1098
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,920
Well,
not really.

1099
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,620
Well apparently they had been doing that
in the,

1100
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,750
even in the same positions for the 
longest time.

1101
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,490
Well India.
So anyway,

1102
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,070
he promoted it in the United States in a
big way.

1103
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:56,370
Yeah.
He'd be a bodybuilder.

1104
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,980
He used to lift weights.
It was checked.

1105
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,963
Yeah.
You've seen those pictures of him back 

1106
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:01,610
when he was young.
He was jacked.

1107
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,740
He's 70.
He would yell at you.

1108
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:07,430
He's swinging Dick and given out fucking
back massages.

1109
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,480
Everybody's in there in a speedo.
Oh yeah.

1110
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,310
The greatest.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1111
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,940
He was wearing that to scare the guys 
away.

1112
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,863
Like,
you know,

1113
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,920
I'm just scared.
I used to take class.

1114
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,400
How you.
It's so hot in there,

1115
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:23,870
man.
You want to wear something like that?

1116
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:26,570
You don't want to have anything on.
It's so hot.

1117
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:28,380
I wear a little shorts.
Short shorts,

1118
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:29,763
like a primal soldiers shore too.
That's what I work on my site where I 

1119
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:37,811
like to wear the Zoomba board shorts and
a and a roots of fight tank top.

1120
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,440
You don't wear a shirt?
No,

1121
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:41,840
it was too hot.
Too Hot.

1122
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,420
I'll come to one with no one in my 
class.

1123
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:45,750
Wears a shirt.
Chicks have to though.

1124
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,050
They have to wear more poor girls.
Yeah.

1125
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,461
But uh,
yeah.

1126
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:52,470
They're all in bikinis.
Did poses like through the whole deal.

1127
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,470
Do the hotel.
It's no joke.

1128
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:56,130
It's not easy.
And hour and a half I'll get to you.

1129
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,160
It's you gotta hydrate.
You gotta hydrate in them.

1130
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,880
When I get up in the morning,
as soon as I get up,

1131
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:04,990
I start drinking water.
Big guys drink a lot of water for.

1132
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,190
I get there.
I'd take a bunch of shroom tech,

1133
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,410
eat some fruit,
10,

1134
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,510
15,
and just get in my car.

1135
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,600
Thirty minutes.
You've got to prepare for that shit.

1136
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,733
Like it's an ordeal.
So fucking sandy's sitting in them 

1137
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,310
squats.
But I'll tell you what,

1138
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:23,390
mack's done wonders for my back.
Wonders for my flexibility,

1139
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,600
wonders for my joints,
like joint pain.

1140
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,870
It's the shit.
And for your brain to man and at our age

1141
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:31,310
we have no choice.
No,

1142
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,410
we have no choice.
You have to do yoga.

1143
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,430
I mean,
unless you want.

1144
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,400
You want to be that guy that's 75 and 
can walk on his hand,

1145
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:42,230
check out on your own or be that 75 year
old that just get to the anger.

1146
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,640
Anger.
Yoga is no joke.

1147
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:45,170
Bring up by younger.
Uh,

1148

Take a look at this motherfucker.

1149
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,280
It's,
how do you say his name is?

1150
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:52,010
Anger.
Anger is what it spells.

1151
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:52,844
Now I'm sorry,

00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,030
Is He your new boyfriend?
No,

1154
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,210
he's an older.
Yes,

1155
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:13,220
but he,
his students shows now homophobic.

1156
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,443
Congratulations.
What have you done to take a look at 

1157
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,450
this motherfucker?
What he did when he was younger?

1158
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,880
The poses he would hold at 75.
I'm trying to find him that guy.

1159
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,943
Oh,
okay.

1160
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,080
It's stupid.
And He.

1161
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,620
How old is he now?
Is he dead?

1162
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,290
Oh No,
come on.

1163
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,070
Our full dad bod.
Fuck you a great gonna.

1164
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,870
Succeed.
Fuck his buddy.

1165
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,230
His buddy's.
If you an extra seed,

1166
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:37,150
let him just rub all over him.
But he would do some crazy shit.

1167
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,013
Dude.

1168
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:44,010
This is the guy you're telling me.
So impressive title right now.

1169
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,070
Watch this though.
Brian is not impressive.

1170
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,370
Flat Ass Watch.
Watch the shit he does.

1171
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,550
I'm watching when he was really all he 
was doing scorpion.

1172
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
What does that look at that versus.
But Bro.

1173
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,920
Dude,
this is 76 before people sick.

1174
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,680
Yoga.
My Yoga teacher would fuck this guy into

1175
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:09,610
the ground stretching.
Okay.

1176
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,580
I don't think you were correct because 
that's right.

1177
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:16,080
There is pretty good.
He does way hanging to the side of.

1178
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,193
The thing about this guy though is he's 
built like a popsicle stick and when 

1179
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:21,294
you're built like a popsicle stick you 
can put your body into weird positions 

1180
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,740
because you don't have any muscle to 
stop it.

1181
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,350
Like there's certain poses,
you know,

1182
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,670
this one where you go under the arms and
you can't do it.

1183
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,680
It's not happening.
It's just too much meat and I'll keep it

1184
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:35,514
right here joe.

1185
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,563
Keep it right here.
Try it though because even in trying it 

1186
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:40,464
you're getting distressed but I don't 
think there's enough physical real 

1187
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:45,750
estate in my troll size,
arms to fit in there.

1188
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,613
That's all I got.
We got to see him do the Scorpion poses 

1189
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:49,464
and shit.
He was the guy would do well I think we 

1190
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:55,170
found our new movement called women and 
people with long arms can definitely get

1191
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:58,470
their arms in better positions that 
because they have more to work with.

1192
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,330
But that also comes up in Jujitsu.
Jujitsu,

1193
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,310
like the ability to get Darcy and oh 
Jesus had.

1194
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:06,910
He can do that shit.

1195
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,380
I can't put my leg like this guy.
Look at this shit.

1196
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,450
Just do.
Took a triangle themselves like that.

1197
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,580
Freaky.
That's pretty cold.

1198
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,640
Come on Bro.
That's freaky.

1199
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,570
The guy's oldest.
Fuck.

1200
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,990
He know why he's doing this because he's
thinking about how much dick.

1201
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:22,720
He's going to swing out.
This video is dumb.

1202
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,290
He was doing the shit when he was second
warmed up.

1203
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,260
I'm going to fuck like this.
Let me show you.

1204
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,380
He got up like my Dick is my legs.
I think he's still alive,

1205
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:37,470
but he was doing it at 75.
He was doing.

1206
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,710
He was on his album.
My ass.

1207
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,150
I put Dumbo.
Triangle suck.

1208
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:50,151
My Cock is not alive to.
He's never going to die at 70 6:40,

1209
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,950
holding his weight.
He's 100 years old here.

1210
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,710
Did his assets deteriorated beyond.
That's going.

1211
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,250
Wow.
That's amazing.

1212
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:00,450
It's 30 years old in this video.

1213
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,820
Look at this fucking spinal flexibility 
though.

1214
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,430
That is incredible.
Don't fuck with my anger when I just say

1215
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,290
that is incredible.
He died.

1216
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,193
He kicked you into thinking it was no 
big deal with me on cook suitcase right 

1217
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:13,380
there in my.
Yeah,

1218
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,880
I can put them in a tote,
gobble,

1219
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:15,714
gobble,
gobble.

1220
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,023
I can bring him in a tote and be like,
I brought my fucking gobbled from nick 

1221
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:27,790
my as well for extra stimulation.
Stimulation to center of Global Chinese,

1222
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,303
Chinese just fine.
This is how I grew up with from my 

1223
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,920
backside.
Notice not a lot of spinal movement.

1224
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:36,783
Just gobble.

1225
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,990
He's talking the whole time.
Teaching.

1226
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,350
This is what I'm thinking of coming in 
my own mouth.

1227
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:49,390
Maybe not today.
Today's not that impressed,

1228
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,270
but I,
you know,

1229
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,263
which he rarely sees though.
You really see people that are built 

1230
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,670
like Jack.
People that are really good at yoga.

1231
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,130
There are a couple of guys I want to 
know.

1232
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,973
I want to see someone mean I know that 
Hixon when he was young was pretty 

1233
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,100
fucking fit and he was on that.
Oh Ninety one,

1234
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:15,983
95,
but he was way better at Yoga than most 

1235
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:20,980
people know.
Like hixon did.

1236
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:21,814
Amazing Shit.
He used to be able to stand in a full 

1237
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:24,514
split on a balancing bar with his leg,
totally straight up in the air on a 

1238
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:28,804
bouncing Barney's.
There's videos of him dooney and Santa 

1239
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,353
Monica.
He's standing on a balancing bar with 

1240
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:34,090
one light,
grabs his other foot and extends it over

1241
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:38,440
his fucking head while was a young 
American students getting muscular.

1242
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:39,303
Some of those American students like 
just got shoemaker who I took a class 

1243
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:43,390
from.
Holy Shit.

1244
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,030
Built like a brick dominating the yoga 
game.

1245
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:50,860
Now there's still a bunch of studios are
all over the place,

1246
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:51,694
but I gotta think that that guy being so
crazy and all the crazy stuff that he 

1247
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:59,290
gets in trouble with and all the assault
allegations,

1248
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:00,124
whether or not they're true,
you know,

1249
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,690
and another thing that he did,
you know the thing,

1250
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:02,524
that tax evasion thing where they found 
a bunch of like a warehouse filled with 

1251
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:07,810
Ferrari's and beat him and he likes 
Croxley's and shit.

1252
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:12,550
He said that he was opening up a school 
for children to teach them auto repair.

1253
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,330
So that's why.
I mean come on Bro.

1254
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,800
He's awesome.
He's amazing.

1255
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,070
And he's a yoga guy,
like everything's so fucked up about it.

1256
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,013
He's like,
he's supposed to be abused in love and 

1257
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:25,210
prosperity and it's important to the 
spirituality.

1258
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:30,250
Not your money now.
Fuck that millionaire teaching strategy.

1259
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:31,690
It's great.
Yeah.

1260
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:34,950
Now I think he just stays in India now.
Fucking America.

1261
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,600
Is there anyone else killing the game 
like that?

1262
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,100
Not really,
no.

1263
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:41,530
Not that I can think of.
Ray Shiva,

1264
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:42,670
rea,
Max strong.

1265
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:43,504
There are a lot of guys who are,
have a really great reputation who have 

1266
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:46,174
a lot of stuff.
Was an older lady that taught to be 

1267
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,430
grown there was pretty famous.
Danny knows her.

1268
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:54,550
She went to Haiti and she's in 
tremendous shape.

1269
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,210
Oh,
isn't she the lady that runs that?

1270
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,010
The place golden bridge or something 
like that.

1271
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:00,460
And La.
Yes.

1272
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,383
She's like a coon Delaney.
Mass Kundalini is the shit that the 

1273
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:06,904
people who do it and even denny says,
you can have psychedelic experiences on 

1274
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:14,230
it that if you do it and you get into a 
certain state where you do the yoga over

1275
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:15,064
and over again to enough,
you can actually stimulate that part in 

1276
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:20,020
your brain that produces dmt.
I was trying to get a stretch,

1277
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:20,601
man.
Eddie,

1278
00:59:20,601 --> 00:59:21,530
your friend.
The lady,

1279
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:22,040
the lady that

1280
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,910
you went to Egypt with,
didn't she wasn't she?

1281
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,240
She knew that she was able to do that.
Right.

1282
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,500
She would tell you she'd have 
psychedelic experiences pay out.

1283
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,990
So that's people that we had bad.
Yeah.

1284
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,760
She had bang at four in the morning to 
shake up the,

1285
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,713
the,
the.

1286
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,120
I don't know that maybe the dmt out 
state,

1287
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:43,200
but she wanted to check in the morning.
I know.

1288
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:47,264
It's funny,
right?

1289
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:48,300
He was into it.
Well,

1290
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,213
but the thing is like your brain does 
produce that shit and so these people 

1291
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:53,084
that say they know how to do it,
it's not outside the realm of 

1292
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:55,334
possibility.
Like it might be possible for you to 

1293
00:59:57,351 --> 00:59:58,820
figure out a way to do it.
I've never done it,

1294
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:00,320
I've only done it through the drug 
itself,

1295
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:03,440
but there's got to be a way to get your 
brain to do it.

1296
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,080
I had a.
well it sounds.

1297
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,933
I didn't even have to explain it,
but I swear to God like there was a 

1298
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:12,170
period of time when I was practicing 
taekwondo so much and I was like,

1299
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,153
you know,
you get to a point where you practiced 

1300
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:14,504
enough where you can think you're kicked
out and they're going gonna laugh at 

1301
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:16,874
this.

1302
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:23,350
Me,
you started releasing dmt is so crazy.

1303
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,243
You say anything.
I'm gonna tell you whatever you're 

1304
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:28,270
saying I'm going to have a problem with.
So I'm going,

1305
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,123
I'm going and I'm committed.
I didn't know whether it was going to 

1306
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:34,550
say you left off at when I used to 
practice taekwondo,

1307
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,320
but I think the way I was stretching my 
body opened up something where I.

1308
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,750
where I went.
I kicked and I,

1309
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,490
I swear to God,
it's gonna sound weird,

1310
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:44,324
but from that point on I got way neater 
with the way I kept my room and the way 

1311
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:48,854
I kept my car and it made sense to me.
Something aligned and there was such a 

1312
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,133
drug induced,
but something happened there and then I 

1313
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,460
thought you're going to say that your 
thoughts.

1314
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,303
When many kicks that your arm,
you just punch and way harder like that 

1315
01:01:04,311 --> 01:01:05,144
movie rookie.

1316
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,370
I fell the tree.
I felt a tree.

1317
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:09,350
A tree was in the way and I side kick 
the trio.

1318
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,890
I don't see any giant oak.
No.

1319
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,920
Steve.
Alright.

1320
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,813
Alright,
we'll do it.

1321
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,890
We'll do it dry.
Fuck it.

1322
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,140
We'll do it.
We'll do a dry dry.

1323
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:19,363
Hey man,
we're going to talk about the fights 

1324
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:21,980
guys.
Fuck.

1325
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:27,010
A lot of people fall off about Kundalini
Yoga.

1326
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:28,364
Yeah,
let's watch that and then we'll go to 

1327
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,040
UFC of retirement from MMA removed from 
drug testing pool.

1328
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:35,690
That's what I would do too if I wanted 
to take drugs.

1329
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:39,110
Just saying he looks good though,
Dave.

1330
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,000
I wanted to get super jacked again.
I'm like,

1331
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:45,680
well someday someday we'll work out a 
deal,

1332
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:48,020
but for now I'm going to toss bitches on
their head.

1333
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:49,760
I like to do that when I weigh about 
3:40,

1334
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,133
so let's get that.
Brendan and I were talking about how I 

1335
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:56,300
liked art for people like Anderson 
Silva.

1336
01:01:56,301 --> 01:01:57,134
I want Anderson to take a testosterone 
and whatever it takes because I want to 

1337
01:02:00,441 --> 01:02:01,274
see the old anderson you didn't like the
Dad Bod know and I'm serious like for 

1338
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:05,360
me,
a great like that,

1339
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,800
who's obviously,
you know,

1340
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:07,634
getting older.
I want to see him fight at the best he 

1341
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:10,484
can.
I miss his incredible skillset and by 

1342
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,080
the way,
if he's,

1343
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:14,973
he's got the mind,
he understands fighting on such a deep 

1344
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,100
level.
His body might just not be with

1345
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,690
fastest.
His mind wants to.

1346
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,613
I want a cat.
I want to catch you out because you're 

1347
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,650
supposed to end your career when your 
body doesn't react to say,

1348
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,680
look,
you can.

1349
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,710
You can make an argument for the Vito 
Belfort School of mma,

1350
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,300
you know,
because that's what you get.

1351
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:35,280
You get the old veteran with the young 
body.

1352
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,660
No.
Yeah.

1353
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,250
I'm talking about when Bryan,
when?

1354
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,850
When vituro rather was at the peak of 
his,

1355
01:02:41,851 --> 01:02:43,800
like most latest cycle.
Right?

1356
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:47,550
When you knocked out Luke rockhold.
When he fucked up Michael Bisping Dude,

1357
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,500
when he knocked out Dan Henderson the 
first time,

1358
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,460
he was a goddamn force of science and 
that's what he was.

1359
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:55,110
He was unbelievable.
Training,

1360
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:58,080
a lifetime of skill.
All that stuff is important.

1361
01:02:58,081 --> 01:02:59,760
First,
write a lifetime skill.

1362
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,340
Lifetime of technique,
ridiculous,

1363
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,680
ferocious warrior spirit,
right?

1364
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:05,514
He's gonna motherfucking Vito Belfort.
Then you add synthetic testosterone and 

1365
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:13,680
you get a monster.
That's what you got when I'm telling you

1366
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:16,860
that guy to this day,
like that period I,

1367
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,580
I think is one of the scariest fighters 
that has ever fought in the sport.

1368
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,550
I think TRT RTV tour is one of the 
fucking scariest guys that ever did,

1369
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,493
but definitely the best one.
80 five on planet earth at the time he 

1370
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:28,590
was for awhile,
man.

1371
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:31,320
He was terrified.
He was fearless,

1372
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:35,940
destroyed rockhold.
We'll take both of them.

1373
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,833
He thought to through to.
We'll kicks in his whole career and one 

1374
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:41,040
of them was he missed with Luke 
rockhold.

1375
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,150
The other one.
He hit him in the face.

1376
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,480
We never saw that from him before.
He threw some kicks.

1377
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,314
He threw nice,
but he was more of a boxing style 

1378
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,520
fighter and then fucked up bisping's eye
with a kick.

1379
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:51,354
Yeah,
headcase.

1380
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,730
Unbelievable.
Bisbing Simon.

1381
01:03:53,731 --> 01:03:56,100
Some issues before that as well.
But that definitely didn't.

1382
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,690
No,
it didn't help.

1383
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:01,240
Like Vito was a monster.
Henderson.

1384
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,390
We get them now.
Like it's,

1385
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,323
it's,
you know,

1386
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,740
even with a Weidman,
which is not the same animal fight.

1387
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,900
Kelvin.
Kelvin Gaslin in,

1388
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,350
in Brazil.
Yeah.

1389
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:12,650
What do you think about that?
Why?

1390
01:04:12,651 --> 01:04:14,400
Why do you think being in Brazil is a 
big deal?

1391
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,400
Um,
I can get some help to regulate his body

1392
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:19,200
back to where are you saying what do 
you,

1393
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,590
when you started your body starts 
producing estrogen and all that.

1394
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:24,900
You can't get it back if it goes to 
Brazil,

1395
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:26,150
right?
They're going to go to Brazil for short.

1396
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,780
Did you go to Brazilian?
I just won't go a lot.

1397
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,540
It wouldn't be the other time.
And like with Josie Outta,

1398
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:32,890
when they tried testing him,
they,

1399
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,210
they made the guy like,
he,

1400
01:04:34,211 --> 01:04:36,360
he had to stay at customs.
They won't let him leave.

1401
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:38,470
Like it was super weird.
Will tell the whole story.

1402
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,090
The whole story.
You got this the first time they came,

1403
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,983
he wouldn't do it.
He wouldn't take the test because he 

1404
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:47,690
said he didn't know the guy,
but apparently the way it happens,

1405
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:48,720
so like,
you know,

1406
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,360
I've talked to people that had been 
tested that like it's super shady.

1407
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,433
They come up to you,
they'll take you into a room that test 

1408
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,050
you.
It's not sterile.

1409
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,910
They just like,
we want to test you right now though.

1410
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,520
Watch you.
When you go to the bathroom.

1411
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,620
Tim Kennedy said they had watched him 
take a shower.

1412
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:03,380
They'd look at him.
She's like,

1413
01:05:03,381 --> 01:05:04,560
you get home from training and they're 
like,

1414
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:06,300
we want to test you,
take a shower.

1415
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,040
I can't take my eyes off you.
They can't.

1416
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:11,050
You can't do it that way for a reason.
Because we were cheating.

1417
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,060
You can't.
They can't.

1418
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,180
So anyway,
so the all the guy,

1419
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:18,730
they're trying to deport him to try to 
kick him out of Brazil,

1420
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,650
like the literally trying to get him out
of it.

1421
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:23,650
It was time to say,
you don't have any authority to test us.

1422
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:24,484
You're not even from this country.
Like they're throwing the kitchen sink 

1423
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:27,574
at them.
Then finally the next day they get them 

1424
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:29,620
to test,
right?

1425
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,690
He gives them tests and he trips and 
spills it.

1426
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,310
Who does,
although it's fantastic.

1427
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,430
So like what?
There you go and then.

1428
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:40,264
So he has to give him another one and 
then it doesn't mean anything he didn't 

1429
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:44,854
do.
He didn't fail.

1430
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,073
Doesn't mean anything,
but it's all like these guys like 

1431
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,990
vandelay runs away from the guy.
They come to his gym,

1432
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:53,500
but go google takes off.
Sure.

1433
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:54,730
You know,
which is the.

1434
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,280
He got fucked more than anybody ever and
the history of that.

1435
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:58,900
However,
because they banned him for life,

1436
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,880
which is insane.
It's 100 percent reversed that.

1437
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,100
Nope.
Well they did.

1438
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:05,680
They made it unconstitutional or 
whatever the fuck they did.

1439
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,340
They said it was illegal,
but they haven't reinstated them.

1440
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,770
No.
But did you see the.

1441
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:13,660
They're about to give cyborg exemption.
Well,

1442
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,020
they see that they figured out whatever 
it is that she has,

1443
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:17,854
whatever personal medical issue that she
has and that this drug does help that 

1444
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,044
personal medical issue and since it's 
not necessarily a performance enhancing 

1445
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:27,790
drug,
what it,

1446
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:29,680
what it is,
is it's a diuretic.

1447
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:30,903
It also is a,
it helps when women start experiencing 

1448
01:06:35,311 --> 01:06:36,144
effects from a androgens,
like it mitigates some of the negative 

1449
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:40,324
effects of Androgens is that there's a 
bunch of different properties that 

1450
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:43,594
these,
uh,

1451
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,200
different diuretics have and whatever 
her condition is,

1452
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:48,034
apparently they're,
they're examining at testosterone a 

1453
01:06:49,711 --> 01:06:54,711
therapeutic use exemption and it looks 
like it's exonerates her and you know,

1454
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:55,984
and all of us who said that she was 
doing something she shouldn't have been 

1455
01:06:58,031 --> 01:06:58,631
doing.
Well,

1456
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:02,110
we don't know what the reasons why she 
was doing it in the first place are.

1457
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:03,880
But we know that in her background 
though,

1458
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:04,714
it's not,
it's not like crazy to assume other 

1459
01:07:06,611 --> 01:07:09,150
things,
but that Duran to me as soon as she won.

1460
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,450
So yeah,
everything's all good.

1461
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:11,800
Like how,
how do you a Cyborg?

1462
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:14,980
She's ready to go get my fucking hand 
hurts down a little while.

1463
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:19,990
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy time world champion,

1464
01:07:19,991 --> 01:07:20,780
right?
Or 46?

1465
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,350
No,
in Moitai 10 time world champion.

1466
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,390
He bring up Cyborg and she's like,
Jesus,

1467
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:29,970
my hand,
it's like world champion if I.

1468
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,933
You just free to sign up,
but you can't say that like right after 

1469
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:37,930
a fight,
like really?

1470
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,260
I don't think she's afraid of February.
That was broken.

1471
01:07:40,261 --> 01:07:43,790
She said I'm going to fight with the 
brother and then I'm going to fix it.

1472
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:48,330
And she could go into 47 and cyborg 
would knock her face off.

1473
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,480
Do you think so?
Yes.

1474
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:51,960
It's going to be interested in.
It gets not say that again.

1475
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:56,500
Was going to destroy her.
Isn't she attend like a 10 time Muy Thai

1476
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:58,420
champion here.
Do not care.

1477
01:07:58,421 --> 01:07:59,254
It doesn't matter.
But you saw it doesn't matter what you 

1478
01:08:01,301 --> 01:08:03,110
saw with Cyborg Fart.
Georgina barge,

1479
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:04,430
right?
We're going to bars.

1480
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,583
You know,
won the fight beside board was very 

1481
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,530
brave for taking that five shots.
She did,

1482
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,230
but that's also straight kickbox also.
Big Gloves,

1483
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:15,064
right?
Yes.

1484
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,063
Cyborg

1485
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,720
people.
Forget how strong she is,

1486
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:21,260
how good she is on the ground and the 
way she hits those kicks are going to do

1487
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:22,670
shit.
Enjoy.

1488
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:26,280
That too.
Enemy was impressive,

1489
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:31,290
but I just feel like that's you that 
sure I'm 100 percent yet Brennan Shaw,

1490
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,913
kiss her death.
The champion could do holly brown ear 

1491
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:38,870
cut.
Eddie Alvarez a pig problem for conor.

1492
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,970
Say that.
Did you say cut to Congress?

1493
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,200
Hasn't sold me yet.
Oh,

1494
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:48,060
come on.
Who is the fuck?

1495
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:50,660
Can you guys see the fucking conor 
mayweather thing?

1496
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,643
It's getting close.
They're saying that it's like literally 

1497
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:54,310
agreed upon.
Amazing.

1498
01:08:54,311 --> 01:08:55,144
So what do you think's going to happen?
Do you think he's going to run into an 

1499
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:57,734
issue with the UFC?
But do you think he's right about the 

1500
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:00,770
Ali Act?
I don't know,

1501
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:03,680
but I think we looked at it.
I have looked at what I think's going to

1502
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:07,250
happen is I think Dana,
there's no way Dan would let this happen

1503
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:07,970
without being part of.

1504
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:08,803
I think they come to agreement with the 
UFC and Dana's part of it and it 

1505
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:13,490
happens.
Here's a question for you,

1506
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:14,880
Joe.
Who's going to commentate it?

1507
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:20,120
Boxing and UFC and boxing match.
It would be a boxing in boxing.

1508
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:21,550
Yeah,
but you need someone who's knowledgeable

1509
01:09:21,551 --> 01:09:24,750
on conor mcgregor dedicate that.
You can't have so many boxes.

1510
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:25,820
No,
it'd be way,

1511
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,720
way better if they did it.
Then if the UFC concept.

1512
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:32,930
Both you have.
I think you have to have one balls,

1513
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:35,750
deep boxing expert and one mma.
Why though?

1514
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,320
Because I know,
but kind of come from that background.

1515
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:41,640
They can give you the history of cotton 
and all that stuff,

1516
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:42,474
but the sport is the sport is boxing,
so I feel like you could have somebody 

1517
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:46,390
who just brush up on that,
right?

1518
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,890
I don't think so.
Someone who represents us,

1519
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,150
would you not do it,
Joe?

1520
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,800
No,
I don't want to do that.

1521
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:52,783
Really?
I want to watch what you guys want to 

1522
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:54,890
get drunk.
That's fair.

1523
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,720
No,
listen,

1524
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:57,554
if that's happening,
we're getting hammered and we're going 

1525
01:09:58,591 --> 01:09:59,424
to fuck with a companion,
but I'd rather do that than be there 

1526
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:03,200
live.
I swear to God I would.

1527
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:07,430
I tell everybody I'm like,
I love compensated for the UFC,

1528
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:08,264
but I fucked up when I started doing the
fight companion because the fight 

1529
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:14,060
companions epic.
It's so much more fun when we get fucked

1530
01:10:14,061 --> 01:10:14,894
up and we're laughing and how I chose 
the knockout and we're watching the 

1531
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,960
second.
I'm sorry,

1532
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,640
I'm sorry,
but it's better.

1533
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:25,970
It is better.
Like being there live is fucking insane.

1534
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:27,770
I mean,
I enjoyed this past weekend,

1535
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:30,140
but I would have definitely enjoyed it 
more if you guys were there.

1536
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,880
Yeah,
that's the.

1537
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,293
Yes,
you should do.

1538
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,060
We should make some sort of a deal where
we do it like this.

1539
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:38,993
Do Colic.
Let those other guys take over the 

1540
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:42,044
commentary and we'll just have this like
we'll have like to sound things you can 

1541
01:10:45,471 --> 01:10:49,310
choose.
You can choose to be companion.

1542
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:53,300
He just go from having an interpreter.
Listen man,

1543
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:54,134
it's.
You get to see people who don't even 

1544
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:56,564
need a component and have fun.
Your companion button you just think is 

1545
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:03,850
annoying.
Sinkings annoying.

1546
01:11:03,851 --> 01:11:05,330
Yes,
we should do that.

1547
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:07,900
Should be like the Spanish channel or 
the span.

1548
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:09,050
You know,
it should be like a little button.

1549
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:11,720
You press and option like you get closed
captions.

1550
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,560
You know how you get closed captions.
Fight.

1551
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,013
Watch the.
You just put it on mute and like what 

1552
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,660
everyone else does on mute.
I want to hear the slap of the kicks.

1553
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:26,340
I want to hear dudes move around.
I want to hear it.

1554
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:29,280
I want to be in here.
See what we're missing.

1555
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:32,400
What we're missing is not that there's 
anything wrong with the commentary,

1556
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:33,234
the commentary is great,
but we can't really broadcast that 

1557
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,590
Kombucha because it's not our product.
Right.

1558
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,603
But if we were sitting here,
we were watching it and we had a raw 

1559
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:45,591
feed where there was no commentary,
just slaps and punches and kicks and you

1560
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:48,660
know,
and we would also like have our own take

1561
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:51,960
on what the fuck is happening rather 
than the commentators take and you know,

1562
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:52,823
if we're wrong,
it'd be even more hilarious because for 

1563
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,273
drunk stoned dudes talking shit while 
they're making each other like mystery 

1564
01:11:59,401 --> 01:12:01,230
science theater that they offered you a 
deal.

1565
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,750
But they said no weed,
you can smoke weed.

1566
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:04,980
He would say,
okay,

1567
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,650
that doesn't make any sense.
It's legal.

1568
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,290
Like marijuana is legal in California.
We're adults.

1569
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:14,370
We pay taxes for just for weed itself.
I'd have to stand up for weed.

1570
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,503
You know,
that's like if somebody said you could 

1571
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,430
do your stand up,
but you can't swear,

1572
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:19,020
I be like,
because of who?

1573
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,900
Like it's not hurting anybody if I swear
it's not hurting anybody.

1574
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:22,651
If I smoke weed.
No,

1575
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:23,484
I'm not gonna agree to that.
That's stupid because I'm in a position 

1576
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:26,370
where I don't have to agree to stupid 
shit.

1577
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,700
That's a stupid thing to agree to.
Imagine you're working with someone.

1578
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,830
You're working with someone that I 
really like you,

1579
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:32,521
Brian,
but I don't want.

1580
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:34,380
You only were in yellow.
Okay,

1581
01:12:34,381 --> 01:12:36,030
you can work with me,
but only wear yellow.

1582
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,920
Do you understand?
Yellow is our color.

1583
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,753
It's how we want to be represented.
When we're giving you the ones and 

1584
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:41,814
Zeros,
we want you to dress with appropriate 

1585
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:45,660
colors.
That is so stupid.

1586
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,310
I can't smoke weed.
Fuck you.

1587
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:48,480
What do you want?
A shitty show.

1588
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,430
Exactly.
What do you want to have less?

1589
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:55,060
Real sponsor gets companies sponsored by
certain wines.

1590
01:12:55,061 --> 01:12:58,810
Chateaus bypass on that call for Eddie 
call.

1591
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,430
Yes.
Yeah.

1592
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:03,120
We don't necessarily need alcohol all 
the time,

1593
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:03,954
but every now and then we go off the 
rails and the bad for the main event 

1594
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,120
shots,
color shots about.

1595
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:10,320
Well,
we're going to have to do is on the next

1596
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:12,980
studio.
I'm going to have a button where we have

1597
01:13:12,981 --> 01:13:14,760
a.
we're talking over each other button,

1598
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,370
so like a button.
I could press were enough to say it,

1599
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:20,430
but we'll see like flames all around us.
Oh,

1600
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,273
it's going bad.
Like I like video were there were there 

1601
01:13:24,021 --> 01:13:24,540
were there.

1602
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,360
Just to let us know.
Everyone has a button.

1603
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,900
When they're talking,
they hold a button or dentist radios,

1604
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:36,590
walkie talkie,
electric shock live.

1605
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:37,470
There's A.
There's a.

1606
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:41,340
there's a light.
You can't get talked over.

1607
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,593
They do have these things,
these arms that we have that have a 

1608
01:13:44,911 --> 01:13:47,460
light on it.
When that I didn't think was,

1609
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:48,390
look,
they look good,

1610
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,640
but now I decided you want.
I'm a Dork.

1611
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,470
I want a little light on these things 
that light up.

1612
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,170
We're on the Internet.
Makes us.

1613
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,590
Is it a green light?
No,

1614
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:56,424
it's red Bro.
Will that be something like the one on 

1615
01:13:58,081 --> 01:13:59,240
the air,
like Brian said,

1616
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,473
fire,
Bro.

1617
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,350
I see you.
Ryan.

1618
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:02,680
Seacrest has one though.
Fuck.

1619
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:04,380
He wasn't makeup before.
He does radio.

1620
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,670
Was everything.
Everything.

1621
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:11,220
Do you think his shirt was rips in it?
I thought that Puma p 45

1622
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:16,660
that killed those out pacas I spent.
I spent two fucking weeks for that guy.

1623
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:20,200
Did you fuck them?
Did you get to small guys about 1:40?

1624
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:21,730
Maybe.
I enjoy the taste.

1625
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,733
I don't know what you talking about.
We got drunk and his study we were 

1626
01:14:25,271 --> 01:14:28,180
reading was he told me,
was he like a guy's guy or were you guys

1627
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:31,190
like Jack and he's a nice guy.
I didn't really friendly guy.

1628
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,163
I've done a show before.
I said something to the effect of did 

1629
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,740
well this year.
He made $30,000,000

1630
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:36,574
that year.
I go,

1631
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,120
what?
Well,

1632
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,220
he goes having a lot of fun,
having a lot of fun.

1633
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,870
He's like a.
He produced it.

1634
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,030
Who produced the Kardashians?
She's involved with all that.

1635
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:45,923
He's getting paid.
He's originally from Finland or 

1636
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:54,244
somewhere.
He said he's like originally not 

1637
01:14:55,391 --> 01:15:00,391
American fucking foreigners.
I think stealing all our fucking factory

1638
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:01,810
jobs for president.

1639
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:04,720
I think he's Swedish.
He is from somewhere else.

1640
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,430
Drama.
I'm wrong.

1641
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,160
He's killing the game though.
American idol.

1642
01:15:09,161 --> 01:15:11,520
There's two hosts and the one guy was 
like,

1643
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,600
fuck it.
This isn't going into Jordan's secret.

1644
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:16,420
Stayed with it.
And so he's from Georgia.

1645
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:20,260
So Brian just made that Swedish.
What would you say?

1646
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:23,050
You're completely full of shit.
Just sweet and then Jordan,

1647
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,780
he's from little little Sweden and 
George.

1648
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,560
Jennifer Lopez still on one of those 
shows.

1649
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:30,020
American idol's a Jennifer Lopez.
The America.

1650
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:32,200
No,
I think they're bringing it back,

1651
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:33,580
but it's been off for a couple of 
seasons.

1652
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:34,443
Oh,
Jennifer Lopez is doing that show with 

1653
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,830
Steve Sharp on that show.
That's the photos.

1654
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,920
Did you see?
Jay Loves J.

1655
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,620
Lo at the grammy's.
God damn she is fine.

1656
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,100
She,
she,

1657
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:44,933
she,
she gets better and better and she's 

1658
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:51,100
older than that.
I think she's 59 or late forties.

1659
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,323
God,
she and rose McGowan and my two 

1660
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:54,070
favorites.

1661
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,510
As far as physical delivery,
physical,

1662
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,130
those two.
It seems weird that you know.

1663
01:15:59,280 --> 01:15:59,591
No,
no.

1664
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:02,520
Rose McGowan is on a basic white girl 
face sheet.

1665
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,510
Let me say I did something with her back
in the day.

1666
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:05,344
I did this thing for vh one where I 
played a perverted fashion photographer 

1667
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,740
that was just in it to get laid.
And I had a couple scenes with her.

1668
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:13,630
She's cool as fuck.
And she's,

1669
01:16:13,631 --> 01:16:15,850
uh,
she's very pretty like,

1670
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:20,990
like her face Manson was taken that we 
did this thing.

1671
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:23,044
It was 1996.
I think it was somewhere around 

1672
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:26,883
[inaudible] 97.
We're talking about the girl from the 

1673
01:16:27,701 --> 01:16:29,400
notebook.
No.

1674
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:37,680
Think of Rachel rose McGowan.
That's my ass.

1675
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,180
Oh my God.
You got these big hanging out the front.

1676
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:42,620
My Dick was showing.
Yeah,

1677
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,010
the idea was gorgeous.
This is rose McGowan.

1678
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,350
Oh,
I said to this girl,

1679
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,900
do you have any problems with nudity?
That's rose McGowan.

1680
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,120
Oh,
you got to see her in real life.

1681
01:16:52,121 --> 01:16:53,270
Too sick.
She's.

1682
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,960
She's beautiful man.
Bad shot.

1683
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,790
Look at Brian.
Brian.

1684
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,733
Brian,
look.

1685
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:02,160
Oh my God.
Damn.

1686
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:03,820
You had your Dick hanging out the front 
of it.

1687
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:04,421
Yeah,
I did.

1688
01:17:04,421 --> 01:17:06,830
I had to show her my deck because the 
idea was I had to say,

1689
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:08,890
do you have any problems with nudity?
And she said,

1690
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,190
no,
cut to me naked.

1691
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,023
Taking a picture.
There was major as being a crazy person 

1692
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,940
that was like really into a with 
photography.

1693
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,650
That's hilarious.
I was just trying to get laid.

1694
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,270
I didn't know anything about 
photography.

1695
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,104
That was like the Joe Gibbs is made by a
friend of mine who was one of the 

1696
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:30,770
writers on the radio.
It's how's Paul says?

1697
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:31,604
Do you ever keep in touch with them?
I run into him or talk to them very 

1698
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,124
rarely,
but up to last time I talked to him was 

1699
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:38,360
when Phil Hartman got a star on the 
Hollywood walk of fame.

1700
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:41,780
We went down there to be there for it 
and it was like a whole celebration with

1701
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:42,614
a bunch of,
uh,

1702
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,740
Phil Hartman fans.
Paul was working on a bunch of different

1703
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:47,420
shows.
He's always working on different things,

1704
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,273
you know,
I think he did boardwalk empire for a 

1705
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,710
while.
Did that show so good.

1706
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,890
So awesome.
So smart man.

1707
01:17:55,891 --> 01:18:00,440
And he's one of the most unusually 
talented people I've ever met.

1708
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:04,290
He's an incredible vital,
hilarious,

1709
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,540
but she's super smart.
That landed in borderline.

1710
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,290
Who's fuck news radio?
Do you ever see news radio?

1711
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:10,124
The show?
He used to be on one of the greatest 

1712
01:18:10,611 --> 01:18:11,411
sitcoms ever.
Dude,

1713
01:18:11,411 --> 01:18:16,160
he was the coolest guy ever to work for 
if you ran a show because he didn't give

1714
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:18,860
a fuck if you came up with a funnier 
line like when,

1715
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,120
when he moved here,
right?

1716
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:21,320
None,
zero.

1717
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,470
The whole writing crew was just about 
get the best line out there.

1718
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:28,340
So like Dave Foley was constantly 
rewriting shit constantly.

1719
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,293
We would write jokes for each other,
like we would see something and you 

1720
01:18:31,221 --> 01:18:33,080
know,
and Vicky Lewis would say to Andy,

1721
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:34,550
how about you try this?
She was amazing.

1722
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,280
It was great to candy Alexander.
Amazing.

1723
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,810
And it was,
it was a crazy cast,

1724
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:40,040
like super,
super,

1725
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:40,990
super talented.

1726
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:42,100
It was amazing,
man.

1727
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,840
He will kill you with the shit he would 
do.

1728
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,310
But I had to do many scenes with them.
And you did an episode with them?

1729
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:47,630
Yeah,
you can't,

1730
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,000
like it's hard to like keep a straight 
face.

1731
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:52,160
Like if I was supposed to be pissed,
like I'd be like,

1732
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,690
I'd be like Andy,
what happened?

1733
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:54,140
And,
and,

1734
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:54,973
and he would say something.
He would go and you'd be like biting 

1735
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:00,560
your face,
their face to keep from.

1736
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,930
I would slap myself in the face in 
between.

1737
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:07,400
Takes to try to get like I didn't laugh.
He's so funny and unpredictable.

1738
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:10,190
Like he's so talented.
Like I did less than perfect within too.

1739
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,660
Yeah.
He would just come out and do shit.

1740
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:12,890
And you'd be like,
what's he gonna do now?

1741
01:19:12,891 --> 01:19:16,430
And he was always fucking hilarious and 
there was Stephen Root,

1742
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:19,810
who's like one of the best actors I've 
ever met him.

1743
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:21,820
This other person,
he was like this.

1744
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,930
He would do a scene,
he would just become someone else.

1745
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,750
He just wasn't there anymore.
Like he would be Jimmy James,

1746
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:28,580
like he would get out of the realm,
you'd be Stephen Root,

1747
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:30,230
you'd be hanging out with them.
He's like this normal guy.

1748
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:31,243
And then he'd come on the set with a 
suit on as Jimmy James and he's Jimmy 

1749
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,240
James was raised.
He was weird.

1750
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:38,030
He was a real actor.
That guy's been acting forever,

1751
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:40,910
like highly trained,
skilled.

1752
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:43,550
Like he was the only one in the cast 
that had like a real character.

1753
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:44,384
Yes.
I mean Phil was just an exaggerated 

1754
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:46,493
fill,
but his character like had a different 

1755
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:52,640
way of talking or different mannerism.
Like he had all planned that out.

1756
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,620
[inaudible].
It's an amazing,

1757
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:57,560
amazing show.
Chemistry like that is very rare.

1758
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:58,423
It's just creates gold.
It's really don't know how we got to 

1759
01:19:59,871 --> 01:20:00,050
that.

1760
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:03,230
But that dude didn't give a fuck.
He's like all about the best line,

1761
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,240
whatever the best line is,
whoever's coming up with the best line.

1762
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:07,830
Yeah,
but when you work in an like that,

1763
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:08,664
then it makes it fun.
When you work with like someone's just 

1764
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,030
super restrictive and like,
you know,

1765
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,550
like they don't let you just express 
yourself.

1766
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:17,290
Then you know those sitcoms or two 
stores.

1767
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,190
You've been in those environments too.
Fucking hard to do.

1768
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,650
Man.
This is so easy to do.

1769
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,770
A podcast is the easiest form of show 
business of all time.

1770
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,240
It really is.
It is.

1771
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,270
And like for doing shit,
it's the best form trays.

1772
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:32,220
It,
it's like the least managed.

1773
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:35,280
It's still the least prepared.
But like if you're listening,

1774
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,173
if you like,
if I'm doing something like around my 

1775
01:20:37,321 --> 01:20:38,154
house,
like if I'm cleaning my office or 

1776
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:39,804
something like that,
I want to listen to a podcast I listen 

1777
01:20:41,831 --> 01:20:44,100
to when I work out.
Now you stolen listening to music that I

1778
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:44,953
listened,
a pug Jesus that we might be balls deep 

1779
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:50,970
too deep in the world to do so much to 
learn game.

1780
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,660
It's all at your fingertips.
You don't have enough time in the day to

1781
01:20:54,661 --> 01:20:55,494
learn shit on the planet,
talk like you can go to Sam Harris and 

1782
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,940
listed the smartest motherfuckers on the
planet,

1783
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,133
have listened to people super stupid to 
make yourself feel better and I'll 

1784
01:21:06,151 --> 01:21:08,760
listen to them.
You think this is doing something to the

1785
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:09,690
way people communicate.

1786
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:14,123
I do think.
I do think that the world is becoming 

1787
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:20,430
less a brutal and ignorant in many ways.
For example,

1788
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,240
you'd find in we went back even a 
hundred years,

1789
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,163
but let's say a hundred and 30 years you
would find a large portion of the globe 

1790
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:34,400
that could have a conversation with you 
on why slavery is necessary and can be a

1791
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:41,900
virtuous in certain circumstances for 
certain people and you'd have no problem

1792
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:43,044
finding maybe half the globe who would 
have a serious conversation with you 

1793
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,430
justifying a form of slavery in today.
In 2017,

1794
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:51,264
you would be hard pressed to find anyone
who could morally or ethically justify 

1795
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:57,623
the idea that you should own a slave and
a North America now in the world also 

1796
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,210
economically not viable anymore.
See,

1797
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,053
like if you could do something like 
Foxconn and have a bunch of people 

1798
01:22:07,871 --> 01:22:08,704
stocked up inside some place and feed 
them and house them and they work 16 

1799
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:13,560
hours a day and jump off the building so
much.

1800
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,660
You have to put nets around.
Yeah.

1801
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,790
What is the difference?
The only difference is they can leave.

1802
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:19,163
They can leave if they want to,
but at some weird kind of form of of 

1803
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:25,560
slaves and indentured servitude or 
whatever it is,

1804
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:27,920
depending on the economy.
What I'm saying is that you.

1805
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,490
You would have,
for example,

1806
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:30,840
if you.
The minute you said,

1807
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:32,670
I know exactly what you're saying,
I know exactly what you're saying.

1808
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:35,500
That's progress to an extent where the 
con was to accept.

1809
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:36,960
Yeah,
but isn't it bizarre?

1810
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:37,794
I mean like what we're talking about 
that like you get something from Japan 

1811
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:42,503
or China rather and you know that it 
came from one of those kinds of 

1812
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:47,160
factories and you're okay with it.
I mean we're all okay with it.

1813
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:48,540
We have to be.
If you want a new iphone,

1814
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:50,670
right?
Well if you want any phone android,

1815
01:22:50,671 --> 01:22:52,990
the android Samsung.
I don't know how.

1816
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:55,930
I don't know,
I'm okay when I don't know.

1817
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,990
I'm okay with it for the following 
reason.

1818
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,880
We went through our own industrial 
revolution and the fact of the matter is

1819
01:23:02,881 --> 01:23:06,340
that when economies are growing and can 
throw a lot of examples

1820
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,290
of that,
look at Korea 30 years ago,

1821
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,980
look at China 20 years ago,
look at all these countries who have,

1822
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,323
who have gained great prosperity and 
higher standards of living for massive 

1823
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,860
sections of their population.
They all started that way.

1824
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:22,270
They all started,
you know,

1825
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,070
it's very difficult to grow your country
to become an industrial powerhouse.

1826
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,680
No,
I totally understand that Brian.

1827
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:31,390
But it's just weird that we allow people
to pay people,

1828
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:34,610
like essentially it's not a company in 
China or you know,

1829
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,360
it's kind of an American company and a 
lot of ways of slavery.

1830
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:40,730
Slavery.
Exactly.

1831
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:43,430
Way Cheaper to,
to,

1832
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:44,413
to have like an involuntary slavery 
network than it is a va because if you 

1833
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:49,990
make it involved,
like,

1834
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,640
you know,
instead of forced slavery,

1835
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,743
um,
you're paying them so little that they 

1836
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:56,890
can never leave.
You just basically,

1837
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,023
instead of providing food for them,
you're just basically giving them the 

1838
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:02,170
money that you would spend.

1839
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,380
If it was real slavery,
yeah,

1840
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,413
you'd have to buy their food and Shit 
and then you'd have to have guards and 

1841
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:09,370
you have to pay guards and now the 
security will feed them there too.

1842
01:24:09,371 --> 01:24:10,570
I mean,
it's real creepy.

1843
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,500
It's you got to realize that like even 
whoever owns the company,

1844
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:16,960
whether it's Chinese people,
the American people,

1845
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:17,794
the American companies have these big 
deals with them for a reason because 

1846
01:24:20,111 --> 01:24:23,720
they can take advantage of those 
loopholes because they.

1847
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,980
Their manufacturing tolerances are super
high.

1848
01:24:26,981 --> 01:24:29,190
They really know how to do it.
There are,

1849
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:33,130
there is a lot of pressure from 
responsible corporate American companies

1850
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:33,964
and they go into those.
Those they go in there because they're 

1851
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:37,324
shareholders find out about this stuff 
and they go in there and by the way 

1852
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:40,983
there I would imagine that a lot of 
people that work at apple is going to 

1853
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:43,584
sound really surprising and these other 
companies are pretty ethical and moral 

1854
01:24:45,721 --> 01:24:46,554
and don't and I've very familiar with 
not feeling good about the fact that 

1855
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:50,584
their company might have a relationship 
with a Chinese affiliate who doesn't 

1856
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:54,214
treat their workers well and in fact a 
lot of these corporations like apple 

1857
01:24:57,971 --> 01:24:58,960
were very,
very.

1858
01:24:58,960 --> 01:24:59,793
An Ibm for example,
were instrumental in going in there and 

1859
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:03,790
saying,
hold it.

1860
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,850
We're not doing business this way.
You're environmental practices.

1861
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,850
I mean there was a whole article about 
how ibm,

1862
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:11,950
if you do business with ibm,
good luck because your vendors,

1863
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,520
your vendors better be environmentally 
responsible.

1864
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,540
Ibm has these environmental standards 
that are just draconian almost for a lot

1865
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:20,374
of companies where it's like,
you may be environmentally responsible 

1866
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:25,300
and you work for us.
We're a big client for you,

1867
01:25:25,301 --> 01:25:27,070
but how about the people that work for 
you?

1868
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,500
How's that draconian though?
Well,

1869
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:29,343
it's not draconian.
I'm saying that that a lot of these 

1870
01:25:30,851 --> 01:25:32,970
corporations have to be responsible to 
share.

1871
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:33,910
Yeah,
smart,

1872
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:35,711
smart,
and they go,

1873
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:37,900
I don't want to do business where people
are indentured.

1874
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:41,810
Definitely right to say that,
but it's also 100 percent,

1875
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,070
but hold on.
It's still,

1876
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,870
no matter what you just said that made 
it look cute.

1877
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:47,704
There's still 100 percent fact those 
people make almost nothing and that's 

1878
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:50,853
how you get your laptop made.
I mean if you want to break it down to 

1879
01:25:52,461 --> 01:25:53,294
reality,
the only way you can say whatever you 

1880
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:55,984
want,
but it's the only widget that is is is 

1881
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:01,610
it possible that this can turn back 
around and they can start meeting.

1882
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,230
The idea of American manufacturing is

1883
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:06,950
thing.
Things that have been kicked around back

1884
01:26:06,951 --> 01:26:11,540
and forth since this whole campaign got 
started essentially,

1885
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,374
right.
Was a big part of what trump getting 

1886
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:16,000
into office was bringing back American 
manufacture.

1887
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:16,640
Great.
Again,

1888
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,420
we all know the story of Detroit.
We have all seen like how they're.

1889
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,980
Oh,
there's another fucking documentary that

1890
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,910
they're doing about this guy who was 
building a farm in Detroit,

1891
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:29,000
the largest farm.
They're making a huge farm in the middle

1892
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:29,834
of Detroit.
They're like knocking down all these 

1893
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:32,420
buildings,
buying up all this land,

1894
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,583
and they're just going to build an urban
farm or what were you going to ask 

1895
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:36,374
though?
What was the question about the realist 

1896
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,910
out to bring manufacturing jobs back?
Yeah.

1897
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,753
I mean doing the idea of it,
the idea of like reigniting the 

1898
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:45,423
manufacturing base of the United States 
and having everything being American 

1899
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:49,484
made being a big thing,
but here's some stuff like electronics 

1900
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:52,130
and things like that.

1901
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:54,860
Is it even past.
So here's the problem is first of all,

1902
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:58,280
the reason that we don't pay crazy 
amounts of reason that the consumers get

1903
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:01,340
to pay not a lot of money for a flat 
screen tv or whatever it might be.

1904
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,174
The reason crisis seemed to come down.
You can go to Walmart and buy a lot of 

1905
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,030
shit for not as much money.
There's efficiency,

1906
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,960
there's a price for efficiency of 
course,

1907
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,810
but for the most part,
if you go to the.

1908
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:16,130
If you look at the infrastructure that 
over 20 years China has built with those

1909
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:16,964
factories that are so incredibly 
efficient and clean and and have just 

1910
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:21,913
locked into exactly how to churn out as 
much product and your company and your 

1911
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:27,920
bottom line is you're responsible.
For example,

1912
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:28,754
if you're a public court mandate,
you're responsible to your shareholders 

1913
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:33,620
to make them as much money,
as many dividends as you can,

1914
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,190
and on top of that turn of profit,
you're going to make your product for as

1915
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,420
little money as possible.

1916
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,253
And by the way,
it's also gonna allow you to bring the 

1917
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:43,240
price down to your consumers can buy.
So what I'm saying,

1918
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,030
what I'm saying is that we all know that
infrastructure without infrastructure.

1919
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:48,223
I have good luck with the American 
manufacturing sector trying to compete 

1920
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:55,280
with the Chinese who have a 20 year head
start and I and I,

1921
01:27:55,281 --> 01:27:56,114
I think that's a fantasy.
Not only is bringing manufacturing jobs 

1922
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:01,970
back to the US as a fantasy,
but more importantly,

1923
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:02,804
we're not even using human beings with 
real enemy to unemployment is our 

1924
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:06,994
automation is not just a 100 million 
Chinese workers that showed up over the 

1925
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:12,320
past 20 years.
Fox automation,

1926
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:16,280
Foxconn,
CEO says investment for display plant in

1927
01:28:16,281 --> 01:28:19,610
us would exceed $7,000,000,000,
a lot of money,

1928
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:23,810
so they have these plants that are 
already set up in China.

1929
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,130
Very high standards for tolerances for 
their manufacturing,

1930
01:28:28,131 --> 01:28:30,480
for not just this,
but also for clothes.

1931
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,510
All sorts of things.
I made.

1932
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,373
We just had a meeting with this company 
and they were saying how they went to 

1933
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:37,540
American factory because they're looking
out source,

1934
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,860
choose tee shirts,
all this stuff,

1935
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:44,240
and then went to American factory and 
then they went to the in China and goes,

1936
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:45,143
it's China's like the Bentley or royals 
Royce have factories in the one that 

1937
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:51,350
went to America that produces a lot of 
our American shit.

1938
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:53,990
He said it was awful like there.
They wouldn't put up with it.

1939
01:28:53,991 --> 01:28:54,824
The standards are even close.
You wouldn't do the people that are 

1940
01:28:57,111 --> 01:29:00,340
jumping out of buildings.
Is that a clean place or dirty places?

1941
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,360
It's

1942
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,220
clean,
clean belting,

1943
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,870
Eddie.
I mean,

1944
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:09,180
I know it seems like a fantasy,
but doesn't it sound like we should.

1945
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,770
We should.
We should try.

1946
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,040
We ever happened.
It'll never happen to.

1947
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,440
We are trying to fuck China.
Let's bring the jobs back here.

1948
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:19,440
We got to at least try at least give 
trump a shot.

1949
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:20,520
We'll see.
We are trying,

1950
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,354
but even trump realizes and everybody 
realizes that there are some companies 

1951
01:29:23,641 --> 01:29:25,920
that countries that do things more 
efficiently.

1952
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:27,450
Right?
So for example,

1953
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,333
just as a bad example,
bananas are easier to grow in the 

1954
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,920
Dominican Republic than they would 
because of the climate and all that.

1955
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,080
Then they would be in Detroit,
right?

1956
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,093
Just because of the weather and stuff.
So that's kind of the idea behind the 

1957
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:41,474
global economy.
The idea that certain companies do it 

1958
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:46,350
eat certain countries,
have the infrastructure,

1959
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:50,490
have the cheaper labor and it's easier 
to churn out more product,

1960
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,400
thereby keep.

1961
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,790
But You keep saying cheaper labor,
like it's no big deal.

1962
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:57,060
I'm not saying it's no big deal.
It just talk about slave labor,

1963
01:29:57,061 --> 01:30:00,650
this whole country's wealth here.
How do you defend?

1964
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,850
It?
Raises the standard of living sorta.

1965
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:04,100
Yeah,
but starts it.

1966
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:06,090
Not sort of Brian,
settle the fuck down.

1967
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:06,953
It does,
but it does in a way where you're doing 

1968
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:10,650
it off the back of the people that are 
making $5 a week course.

1969
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:11,543
Okay,
but that's what we keep saying and you 

1970
01:30:12,481 --> 01:30:13,314
keep glossing over.
It went up when I'm trying to explain 

1971
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:19,410
like why it's a problem to a lot of 
people that listen to this.

1972
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,750
You want to gloss over it and Fox News 
it up,

1973
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,490
sir.
I don't listen to Fox News by the way.

1974
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:26,000
Let's get a couple things straight.
The fuckers get them.

1975
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,400
I don't get my news off a CNN or Fox 
News gets.

1976
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:31,210
Who doesn't read news?
It's all.

1977
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,300
Who's your fuckers?
Where do you get your news?

1978
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:34,693
I read.
I read publications and I do a lot of 

1979
01:30:37,471 --> 01:30:39,720
blow shit.
I do a lot of bluff.

1980
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:41,850
I'm not glossing over anything.
I'm trying to say,

1981
01:30:41,851 --> 01:30:43,530
is this really something that you keep 
saying it?

1982
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,950
We know what I'm saying is definitely 
less than a standard.

1983
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,400
If you go over one more time,
I'm going to freak Brian.

1984
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:53,243
You're being very repetitive.
Standard of living in those countries 

1985
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:01,160
has raised exponentially said that of 
these people that are making things,

1986
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:06,480
not of buildings.
Brian,

1987
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,940
we got to Brian.
Brian,

1988
01:31:08,941 --> 01:31:09,774
it's illegal to make those people work 
like that in the United States for a 

1989
01:31:11,941 --> 01:31:13,740
fucking reason,
and they're human beings,

1990
01:31:13,741 --> 01:31:14,574
so if they're human beings and China and
they're working in this horrendous 

1991
01:31:16,441 --> 01:31:20,080
conditions are not insane hours.
They are Brian and some aren't.

1992
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:22,500
They're living these factory.
Some factories.

1993
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,020
You're 100 percent right.
I would know there was some factories.

1994
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,250
It's just a disco.
They go in,

1995
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:27,084
they give them a drink.
Everybody gets a foot massage work 

1996
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:32,443
there.
I'm not saying I got to not saying that 

1997
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:39,950
Fox News Dad is coming out of your mouth
as I have nothing against slavery.

1998
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,070
No,
I'm not saying that.

1999
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:46,770
I believe in slave labor.
It's not hard work.

2000
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:51,610
I'm just saying that every country has 
industrialized the same way.

2001
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:52,650
That's.
They were a bunch of.

2002
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,513
The factory was filled with a bunch of 
hot women from Norway that were sweaty 

2003
01:31:56,311 --> 01:31:57,420
all the time of the breasts are hanging 
out.

2004
01:31:57,421 --> 01:32:00,310
We've been fucking trying to save them.
We can't make them work these hours.

2005
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,680
I just can't do it,
but because it's Chinese people,

2006
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:07,681
Brian's legacy economies,
the Chinese,

2007
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:11,973
the Chinese demanding higher wages to do
an export in their jobs to other 

2008
01:32:14,801 --> 01:32:17,980
countries of the week.
They can buy a subway sandwich.

2009
01:32:17,981 --> 01:32:18,814
Footlong maybe off.
Maybe I am not saying you end of the 

2010
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:23,340
week.
Those characteristics.

2011
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,560
You're mischaracterizing little plastic 
cup and get some water.

2012
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:30,600
How much would an iphone costs if we 
built it in the thousand dollars?

2013
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:32,860
Million Dollars.
$1,000,000.

2014
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,540
What do you think?
They're like 700 bucks an hour.

2015
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:35,673
First of all,
we literally don't have the kind of 

2016
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:39,190
factory,
so you'd have to build the factory.

2017
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:42,310
You'd have to build this month,
so it costs billions of dollars to build

2018
01:32:42,311 --> 01:32:44,250
one of those super high tech factories 
too much more.

2019
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:45,243
Then on top of that,
you would have to hire people as he 

2020
01:32:47,321 --> 01:32:50,290
falls asleep.
That's substantial wage,

2021
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:52,540
but it could be done.
It's not an impossible thing.

2022
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,160
It was done in China.
It could be done over here.

2023
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:55,023
They can make it will cost more.
It would definitely cause you would go 

2024
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:58,923
up,
but don't you think that the country 

2025
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:02,230
should subsidize fucking iphones instead
of corn?

2026
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:03,303
Because all these cuts are putting corn 
and everything and Corn Syrup and this 

2027
01:33:05,321 --> 01:33:06,154
and that.
Everybody's getting fat as fuck and 

2028
01:33:07,091 --> 01:33:09,460
people are dying of heart attacks.
Just got goddamn corn port.

2029
01:33:09,461 --> 01:33:10,271
Hey,
protein.

2030
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:12,310
Hey by the corn powder.
Can I just talk for a second?

2031
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:15,400
That'd be okay.
All this corn and everything.

2032
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:16,323
Jesus Christ,
maybe we subsidized cell phone talking 

2033
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:20,080
to a lot more.
They need fucking corn.

2034
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:25,140
Talk to Archer Daniels Midland lobbying 
efforts strong about slaves and how good

2035
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:28,610
they are.
So Slavery Motherfucker,

2036
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:29,381
right?
It's a free country.

2037
01:33:29,381 --> 01:33:30,960
I can say what I want,
but you know those,

2038
01:33:30,961 --> 01:33:33,130
the guys that own these factories in 
China,

2039
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,910
you know,
they're down to like,

2040
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:36,370
they want to assassinate trump.

2041
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:37,330
Right?
Thanks.

2042
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,910
So he's really gonna.
Pull those,

2043
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:40,830
those.
Uh,

2044
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:42,280
they don't.
None of them not threatened at all.

2045
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:44,350
It took so long to do that.
A loop.

2046
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,500
No one's gonna know Eddie.
No one's going to do it.

2047
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:48,390
Then.
Let's look.

2048
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,960
First of all,
you hear what he was talking about,

2049
01:33:49,961 --> 01:33:53,560
like putting the taxes on Mexico to 
build the wall and stuff like that.

2050
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,470
All those proposals have to get through 
congress.

2051
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:57,910
Yeah,
and good luck.

2052
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:00,640
Good luck with all that and especially 
because he doesn't see.

2053
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:01,653
The thing about running a country is 
it's very different than running a 

2054
01:34:03,401 --> 01:34:05,080
business.
There's a bunch of checks and balances.

2055
01:34:05,081 --> 01:34:06,580
If he's running a business,
he's the king.

2056
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:09,430
Like there was this thing that John 
Oliver had on a show,

2057
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,293
but we were talking about how like he 
would exaggerate about the amount of 

2058
01:34:11,951 --> 01:34:13,780
floors in this building.
You know,

2059
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:14,614
you think you're on the 14th floor,
but really on the eighth floor because 

2060
01:34:16,721 --> 01:34:18,640
he would like say there's like 68 
floors,

2061
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:20,540
58.
He just does whatever he wants,

2062
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,000
but it makes it look more exciting.

2063
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:26,770
But you can't,
when you're dealing with Congress,

2064
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:29,380
that's not going to work because when 
you run,

2065
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,273
if you run it like that,
see the reason why it's good that 

2066
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:34,660
there's this brock,
your seat in place,

2067
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:35,494
bureaucracy in place is that if someone 
isn't with the right or the left or on 

2068
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:40,600
their own and they want to run this 
thing,

2069
01:34:40,601 --> 01:34:41,800
like I'm gonna bring my own security,
I'm gonna.

2070
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:44,610
Run out,
nobody's gonna be on your side like.

2071
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,210
And those people have to be on your 
side.

2072
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:47,133
So then you have to figure out how 
you're gonna work with these people to 

2073
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:50,620
get things on your side.
But you have to do it legally and you're

2074
01:34:50,621 --> 01:34:51,454
being watched for the microscope.
Everybody's looking at everything you 

2075
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:54,730
do.
That's why this guy,

2076
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,560
what is he,
what's his name?

2077
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,820
Flint that got.
He got removed today.

2078
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:01,340
I stepped down.
He had to step down in a business.

2079
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,530
What he did would have been mum,
mum under the table.

2080
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,540
Everybody shut the fuck up.
They're doing deals.

2081
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:07,650
So talking to people to try the 
Russians.

2082
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:10,420
Mischaracterize what you said.
What did he do?

2083
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:11,323
We should look it up very specifically,
but from what I understand is he had an 

2084
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:19,600
inappropriate conversation with Russian 
emissaries about sanctions.

2085
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,940
Whether or not those sanctions would be 
wet,

2086
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:23,774
you know,
eased up under the because we have 

2087
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:30,461
sanctions on Russia because he's a poor 
fit for national security advisor.

2088
01:35:31,401 --> 01:35:34,810
Michael Flynn resigned and then scroll 
down a little bit there.

2089
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,440
It says,
National Security Advisor,

2090
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:37,274
Michael Flynn,
has resigned after reports that he 

2091
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:41,990
misled senior White House officials 
about his conversations with Russia.

2092
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,890
The liberals are freaking out right now 
screaming into their lockers.

2093
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:48,620
Conservatives are,
I know president trump has named,

2094
01:35:48,621 --> 01:35:51,590
but the liberals are fucking.
They're ready to ride like shit on fire.

2095
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:55,070
It's going to go down to starbucks,
kicked the door in retired army,

2096
01:35:55,071 --> 01:35:59,090
Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg as 
Acting National Security Advisor.

2097
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:01,340
Kellogg previously served as Flynn's 
chief of staff,

2098
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:02,270
blah,
blah blah,

2099
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:02,990
blah,
blah.

2100
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:06,980
The embattled Flynn blamed his 
resignation late Monday on the fast pace

2101
01:36:06,981 --> 01:36:07,814
of events that led him to inadvertently 
give vice president pence and others 

2102
01:36:11,241 --> 01:36:12,074
incomplete information in quote about 
his phone conversations with Russia's 

2103
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:20,140
ambassador to the U.
S Sergei Kissy Celiac.

2104
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:21,773
They probably recorded those 
conversations and if he said anything 

2105
01:36:24,021 --> 01:36:28,220
about sanctions being eased up when 
trump comes into power,

2106
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:31,670
etc.
That would be very unapplied guy.

2107
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:36,980
I have sincerely,
sincerely apologize To the president,

2108
01:36:36,981 --> 01:36:37,814
the vice president,
and they have accepted my apology for 

2109
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,800
flynn wrote in his resignation letter.
Wow.

2110
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:44,750
This is weird.
Really weird.

2111
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:45,643
Look at this.
Pencil defended flynn's contact with 

2112
01:36:47,361 --> 01:36:48,194
Russia and when it became clear,
the national security advisor had not 

2113
01:36:50,691 --> 01:36:51,524
been forthcoming.
Series questions raised about his 

2114
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:55,220
ability to keep the job.
This is fucking house of cards,

2115
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:58,220
like house of cards is real,
especially since Russia,

2116
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:02,600
according to both sides of the aisle,
was probably involved in hacking.

2117
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:03,643
Don't say that you keep saying hacking 
because they didn't do anything that 

2118
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:07,634
actually affected the election.
They might have done something in 

2119
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,053
affected people's perceptions and let it
affected the way they votes but the 

2120
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:17,090
thumb.
But what they did was never disputed.

2121
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:19,250
Like when the information they pulled 
up,

2122
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,740
no one's ever saying it's fake.
They're saying it's true.

2123
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:22,663
So what they did,
where they showed that hillary was 

2124
01:37:23,901 --> 01:37:25,640
rigging the primaries against bernie 
sanders,

2125
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:27,920
the say that that influenced the 
election.

2126
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:28,763
Yes it did,
but it influenced it because what they 

2127
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:31,424
did was dirty as fuck and business as 
usual and then people got a chance to 

2128
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:35,181
look at it.
Well,

2129
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:37,790
they also know that that russian agents 
are.

2130
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:41,660
It's alleged russian agents hacked into 
certain dnc computers.

2131
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:46,930
So just high level high level democrats.
That's all well think there is proof,

2132
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,090
but the bottom line is even if they did 
do it,

2133
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:53,900
what they released is something that we 
should know about because we should know

2134
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:54,734
the democratic party is against one of 
the most popular people of the 

2135
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:58,350
democratic party.

2136
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:00,930
There just wasn't playIng ball.
That's bernie sanders,

2137
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:04,860
bernie sanders,
a guy who's legitimately altruistic like

2138
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:07,440
seems like.
It seems like a guy was legitimately not

2139
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:08,274
controlled by money.
Seems like a guy who is legitimately 

2140
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:13,100
looking maybe even misguided by some 
economics though.

2141
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:15,750
economist standards,
maybe even misguided,

2142
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:20,520
but the idea that he's trying to change 
the income inequality in this country in

2143
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:21,510
some way,
shape or form,

2144
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,613
at the very least,
he's opening up the dialogue about it 

2145
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,553
and the Helen Hayes and all the other 
people are hitting the brakes on that 

2146
01:38:27,871 --> 01:38:28,704
shit and we found out about it,
so we found out about the crazy 

2147
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:33,840
bureaucracy.
We found out about hillary talking about

2148
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:37,800
marijuana and saying that she's against 
it in every sense of the word.

2149
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:38,783
Marijuana legalization.
She's helping people who are spending 

2150
01:38:41,941 --> 01:38:44,130
money because they're going to make 
money if pod is illegal,

2151
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:47,370
so she's essentially making it okay for 
cops,

2152
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:51,250
for jackbooted thugs to lock people up 
in a fucking cage over pi.

2153
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:54,870
You're saying she's not just corrupt.
That's a monster.

2154
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:55,743
A person who would say that she's 
against marijuana legalization in every 

2155
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:02,340
sense of the word.
that person is an enemy of history.

2156
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:03,623
Like you're a selfish monster who's 
willing to do something completely 

2157
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:11,910
irrational just for personal gain.
That's it.

2158
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:14,850
That's a knock on hillary from day one 
and there are.

2159
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,713
There's a whole paper trail though,
is so scare of hair corruption and 

2160
01:39:18,721 --> 01:39:21,330
people don't think it's scary because 
it's pot and pot sounds silly,

2161
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:23,760
but it's not about pot.
It's about freedom.

2162
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:24,803
It's about you doing something that 
doesn't hurt anybody else in somewhat 

2163
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,900
deciding that they can lock you in a 
cage because they write some things down

2164
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:33,930
on paper and it's no different if she 
wants to do that,

2165
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:36,030
then if someone in this room wants a 
lot,

2166
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:40,320
one of us up for the five of us got 
together and one of us wanted to lock us

2167
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:42,120
up because one of us is smoking pot.

2168
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:45,390
It's that fucking stupid.
It's really that stupid.

2169
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:46,793
It's an insane,
insane law and the fact that she was 

2170
01:39:49,231 --> 01:39:52,770
totally down to keep that log going in 
every sense of the word.

2171
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,080
That's an insane person.
Yeah.

2172
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,273
Well,
it's not just that her clinton 

2173
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:58,440
foundation was a pay per flight.
Look up what's gone now,

2174
01:39:58,441 --> 01:39:59,274
right?
Isn't it?

2175
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:00,253
What a surprise that it folded up.
How [inaudible] amazing that she no 

2176
01:40:02,551 --> 01:40:03,384
longer has any influence in government 
and all of a sudden the all those 

2177
01:40:06,691 --> 01:40:07,524
donations of folded up.
What a surprise that that was an 

2178
01:40:09,241 --> 01:40:10,074
altruistic organization,
but now that they can't grant anybody 

2179
01:40:12,121 --> 01:40:13,710
favors,
all you have to do,

2180
01:40:13,711 --> 01:40:16,170
don't look this up now,
but if you're listening uranium one,

2181
01:40:16,171 --> 01:40:21,171
deal a whitewater and travelgate,
just those ones and look up how corrupt,

2182
01:40:22,681 --> 01:40:27,560
and this is why a lot of people have a 
problem with the ideologues on the left,

2183
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:31,320
could they won't acknowledge that,
so everybody that sees that and sees the

2184
01:40:31,321 --> 01:40:32,400
deep,
deep,

2185
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,593
deep,
just integrated corruption that it's 

2186
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:38,690
just almost inoperable.
Corruptions,

2187
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,533
right?
They see that and they don't want to 

2188
01:40:40,861 --> 01:40:43,200
admit it because they say trump is bad 
and if you had,

2189
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:44,063
if you talk about it,
they said trump is bad and they have 

2190
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:48,600
valid concerns about trump,
but that doesn't negate all the problems

2191
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:49,434
with her place tries elective because 
the democrats decided to nominate 

2192
01:40:53,651 --> 01:40:53,980
somebody

2193
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,813
who in 2008,
the democratic voters already told you 

2194
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:59,380
they didn't like.
They didn't trust women,

2195
01:40:59,381 --> 01:41:01,180
didn't trust her,
not just men.

2196
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:03,700
Women didn't trust her.
So at the end of the day,

2197
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:04,600
you guys,
you know,

2198
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:08,230
the democrats put up a candidate that 
people didn't trust.

2199
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:11,660
They just didn't.
She just had a history oF tufts.

2200
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:13,750
She talked anytime.
Award came out of her mouth.

2201
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,740
I didn't believe anything.
She's just the most insincere bad actors

2202
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,810
out there.
Her husband,

2203
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:21,490
he was mad.
He was believable.

2204
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:23,560
You wanted to believe bill clinton,
but he was.

2205
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:26,590
He was just better at line,
but she's terrible at line,

2206
01:41:26,591 --> 01:41:28,080
right it.
She's terrible.

2207
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:30,770
Do you believe in talking you about it 
is?

2208
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,013
It's hard to imagine that the system is 
so fucked up that it's missing key 

2209
01:41:36,941 --> 01:41:41,230
players so badly that someone that 
flawed could get to a position where the

2210
01:41:41,231 --> 01:41:42,064
country has to choose whether or not 
this insanely flawed person gets to run 

2211
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:47,980
the country like that's crazy 
intelligent.

2212
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:51,250
Many people vicious and our chat and all
these smart people,

2213
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:53,110
they are so.
Exactly,

2214
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:56,680
and that's the problem and rightly so.
Why would you want that shitty job?

2215
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:03,100
Because I'm pro slavery.
You can't do what you used to be able to

2216
01:42:03,101 --> 01:42:03,934
do with that job.
That job was a good job when you were 

2217
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:06,253
jfk.
It's not a good job When you're fucking 

2218
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:09,220
obama.
It's not a good job.

2219
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:10,520
Stressfulness,
you're,

2220
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,403
you're dying out there.
See obama just having the time of his 

2221
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:17,030
life,
no party fucking much week to week,

2222
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:18,563
nonstop edibles and thinks about drones.
Didn'T he stopped smoking in the middle 

2223
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:22,960
of his presidency?
No.

2224
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:25,180
Before I thought,
I'll ask you again.

2225
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,040
Do you think eats edibles and thinks 
about drones?

2226
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:28,810
I've to my president.
I'm not going to answer that question.

2227
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,310
It's not your friend anymore.
Yes.

2228
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:32,440
I don't know.
Donald tRump's our president.

2229
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:33,860
It's true.
No.

2230
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:36,130
Just see that girl got tattooed on her 
on her side.

2231
01:42:36,131 --> 01:42:38,680
I put it up on my instagram.
She's got it tattooed on her side.

2232
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:40,270
Trump is not my fucking president.

2233
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,430
Yes,
I live in America.

2234
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,540
Bit.
That's your president,

2235
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:45,940
but hoW deep is that?
Imagine going down on her.

2236
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:50,970
He pulled her shirt off and you're like 
a democracy vibrant.

2237
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,090
Saying that trump is not my fucking 
president.

2238
01:42:55,091 --> 01:42:55,924
Tattoo on someone's side makes our 
democracy vibrant because that's not 

2239
01:42:58,661 --> 01:43:00,070
correct.
Freedom of speech there,

2240
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:02,050
but the writing down on your body 
forever.

2241
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:04,330
It's crazy because in four years they'd 
be Like,

2242
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:05,223
yeah.
My last last night during while Donald 

2243
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:11,950
Trump was running for the republican 
nomination,

2244
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:13,780
I really didn't pay that much attention 
to.

2245
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:14,823
I hear,
I heard crazy shit that he said about 

2246
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:18,370
mexicans.
He said this and that,

2247
01:43:18,371 --> 01:43:19,061
and I'm like,
damn,

2248
01:43:19,061 --> 01:43:21,160
he sounds like a crazy.
Didn't really pay attention.

2249
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,510
But when,
uh,

2250
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:24,210
you know,
he won the nomination,

2251
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,200
he was going against hillary.
I started to Pay attention,

2252
01:43:26,350 --> 01:43:29,410
but then you always hear about shitty 
set in the past.

2253
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,333
Although I never heard it.
I just bought when he was running 

2254
01:43:32,531 --> 01:43:33,364
against hillary and they were debating,
I agreed with to me just seemed like an 

2255
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:37,893
honest shit talker.
That's what it seemed like on honest 

2256
01:43:39,251 --> 01:43:39,861
shit.
Talker,

2257
01:43:39,861 --> 01:43:41,170
you know,
he's not politically correct.

2258
01:43:41,171 --> 01:43:42,004
He said some abrasive shit,
but he's being an honest and hillary 

2259
01:43:44,531 --> 01:43:47,380
wasn't being honest at all.
So last night I went back and I said,

2260
01:43:47,381 --> 01:43:48,214
you know what?
People keep saying all this shit that 

2261
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,950
donald trump's that I go,
let me,

2262
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,490
I want to youtube.
Sorry.

2263
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:55,320
The library was closed,
but I went to youtube and I punched him.

2264
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,660
Donald trump's worst quotes and like 
the,

2265
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:03,740
the worst number other than I smoked,
smoked a bowl and I'm like,

2266
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:05,730
let me,
let me fucking find out what the fuck he

2267
01:44:05,731 --> 01:44:08,930
saying and he's,
he,

2268
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:12,200
he talks shit.
But I agreed with most.

2269
01:44:12,201 --> 01:44:13,610
I didn't really think anything was bad.

2270
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:17,090
I was like,
is this a pro Donald Trump oF video?

2271
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,153
like,
because people always hear that he said 

2272
01:44:19,221 --> 01:44:21,650
like the worst shit.
Like he's saying shit about mexicans.

2273
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:24,180
What is he saying is to calling them 
wetbacks and what does he saying?

2274
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:30,100
They exaggerate everything and I think a
lot of now and I'm like,

2275
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:30,973
wait a minute.
I went back and I swear to god I had a 

2276
01:44:33,081 --> 01:44:34,810
check because I was just going through 
video after,

2277
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:39,770
is it pro trump or against trump?
This worship to me sounds like a,

2278
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:41,200
like a boss,
you know,

2279
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:44,090
he's a talker.
He's up in the guide.

2280
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:44,953
Then I went back and watched the ct was 
saying while he was running against ted 

2281
01:44:47,301 --> 01:44:48,134
cruz and rubio.
Those guys seem like they seem like 

2282
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,033
they'Re hypnotized.
They're like mk ultra know what they're 

2283
01:44:55,161 --> 01:44:56,270
going to say.

2284
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:01,100
Yeah.
I never had a problem with trump of what

2285
01:45:01,101 --> 01:45:03,220
he said,
my product that's robberies,

2286
01:45:03,221 --> 01:45:05,410
that he doesn't totally real.
Yeah.

2287
01:45:05,411 --> 01:45:07,700
I.
My worry about trump is that he's.

2288
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,590
I think he's very,
very narcissistic,

2289
01:45:09,591 --> 01:45:10,424
but I also think he doesn't seem that 
informed or that interested in knowing 

2290
01:45:14,331 --> 01:45:16,120
what he doesn't know.
That was always my way.

2291
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:17,330
Surround yourself with.
I don't know,

2292
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:20,000
it could be a double cross.
I'm not sold on trump,

2293
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:24,050
but the one thing is,
thank god it's not drunk.

2294
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:26,510
All the payments in the past and I 
haven't seen you do that in a long time.

2295
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:27,753
I've been here for awhile.
I had to get here from meeting an hour 

2296
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:32,180
early,
so I've been drinking my hit my wall.

2297
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:34,460
I was just happy that hillary didn't 
win.

2298
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,373
You know?
That could have been anybody on the 

2299
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:36,914
other side.
I just all the shit on hillary and her 

2300
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:40,790
camp,
the people that run her shit,

2301
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:42,110
that's too dark for me.

2302
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:43,520
I don't want that to keep going.
The thing.

2303
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:45,530
So she could have been running against 
bozo the clown.

2304
01:45:45,531 --> 01:45:47,050
I would have been bozos.
Bozo,

2305
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:47,903
bozo or deez nuts.
What a lot of people did just to just 

2306
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:53,040
two things that are good about having 
someone like trump in order in,

2307
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:53,933
in office.
One thing is that people are going to 

2308
01:45:55,371 --> 01:45:56,204
get energized.
Now they realize that voting works and 

2309
01:45:57,591 --> 01:45:58,424
there's real consequences to not voting 
and the person that you maybe didn't 

2310
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:02,294
want,
and then also we have to reexamine our 

2311
01:46:03,561 --> 01:46:04,394
electoral college system that was 
created back when people couldn't 

2312
01:46:06,471 --> 01:46:08,990
fucking communicate with the 
representatives.

2313
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:10,153
You couldn't get to Washington.
Can you just vote on your email or your 

2314
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:15,650
computer?
There are 100 percent.

2315
01:46:15,651 --> 01:46:19,030
Should be a way that you vote online 
just like you can just email,

2316
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,113
email.
That's your email because you have a 

2317
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:25,220
social security number.

2318
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,053
Everybody has one.
That's what you should be able to enter 

2319
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,750
to enter into an app that everybody 
gets.

2320
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:31,280
You have a photo,
you stand there.

2321
01:46:31,281 --> 01:46:33,290
It takes a photo of you,
takes your fingerprint like it does when

2322
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:36,030
you order something with apple pay or 
some shit and vote.

2323
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:38,060
It's not hard.
It's not hard to do.

2324
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:38,894
They can do it.
They just don't want to invest anytime 

2325
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:41,503
and they can control.
it's way easier to control controlled 

2326
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:45,014
groups of people.
AS soon as you have everybody that's 

2327
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:49,250
over 18 having access to vote 
instantaneously,

2328
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,193
their phone,
you're gonna get a different result and 

2329
01:46:51,631 --> 01:46:53,910
you're going to get people like justin 
bieber becoming president,

2330
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:57,630
like really like you don't understand 
like we have a popularity contest.

2331
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:59,810
That's what.
That's what being the president.

2332
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:02,340
It's fucking ridiculous.
If you look at the amount of people that

2333
01:47:02,341 --> 01:47:03,174
are on instagram or on twitter,
like people that have like 49 million 

2334
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:06,774
followers at any given time,
one of those motherfuckers can string 

2335
01:47:09,331 --> 01:47:11,430
together some really good sentences and 
we're like,

2336
01:47:11,431 --> 01:47:13,800
george clooney for president will 
fucking do it.

2337
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,870
We don't even care if you're good at it.
Katy perry,

2338
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,720
we'd be so powerful and so amazing.
I know she can do it.

2339
01:47:21,721 --> 01:47:24,030
Lady gaga could be the fucking president
of the United States.

2340
01:47:24,031 --> 01:47:26,100
Mark my words.
She was on the superbowl.

2341
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:31,190
She said she was $100 million.
Okay.

2342
01:47:31,921 --> 01:47:34,110
Selena gomez can be president.
I'll vote for right now.

2343
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:36,030
I don't even know who she is.
She's dating the weekend.

2344
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:39,180
I'm so lost.
I'm so out of the former.

2345
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:40,083
Next.
The problem you can solve with the 

2346
01:47:41,101 --> 01:47:45,060
electoral college is that if you do it 
just by popular vote like that,

2347
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,253
then that's one issue with it,
but also the fact that states that are 

2348
01:47:49,711 --> 01:47:53,130
not very populated would get ignored by 
their,

2349
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,600
by the government because they don't get
ignored when it comes.

2350
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,673
Yeah.
It would do when it comes ignored when 

2351
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:01,320
it comes to passing bills that help 
them.

2352
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,153
We're getting funding or subsidies,
but also maybe they'd have to stop god 

2353
01:48:04,441 --> 01:48:05,274
fucking card and putting it in 
everything and get with the times that 

2354
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:10,360
he's dying from corn.
Brian,

2355
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:14,000
there's hope that corn fed on hillary.
I like that.

2356
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:16,480
Oh yeah.
I never liked the spark that was.

2357
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:21,180
I was under the impression that pro 
libertarian brother,

2358
01:48:21,181 --> 01:48:22,660
um,
I'm a pretty conservative guy,

2359
01:48:22,661 --> 01:48:25,140
but there was no,
there was no good choices.

2360
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:27,300
No,
I couldn't pick what he wants to do it.

2361
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,010
I'm down to give trump a chance to turn 
the economy around.

2362
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:33,670
No,
he might after.

2363
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:35,610
There's a lot of programs going to go 
after them,

2364
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:39,000
but I'm not sold on trump,
but I liked what he said.

2365
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:41,670
I like that he's honest.
He's definitely,

2366
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:45,500
he never said he never called mexicans 
wetbacks or anything like that.

2367
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:46,343
He just said the same shit clinton said 
about immigration in more of a abrasive 

2368
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:52,950
way.
That's all.

2369
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:54,590
He was more abrasive about it.
Well,

2370
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,433
it bill clinton,
she said all the same shit that people 

2371
01:48:57,751 --> 01:49:01,200
are upset sucked in the lighthouse.
That's not a big deal and it's not a big

2372
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:01,950
deal.
Whoa.

2373
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:03,870
I said,
let him go.

2374
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:05,060
I'm a.
I'm a political.

2375
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:05,943
Jfk.
Jfk had an affair with Marilyn Monroe 

2376
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:08,910
was married.

2377
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:17,440
He had an 11 affairs during.
That could be bullshit.

2378
01:49:17,461 --> 01:49:18,620
That could be disciplined.
Oh,

2379
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:22,670
well here's my question.
Here's my question though.

2380
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:23,743
Get chlamydia.
Should Donald Trump say anything 

2381
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:28,380
positive happens from this?
It's going to be.

2382
01:49:28,381 --> 01:49:29,214
It's going to inspire other people that 
are like unconventional type candidates 

2383
01:49:32,371 --> 01:49:34,990
to run that might be better or more 
likely to time.

2384
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,160
Trump.
trump.

2385
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:39,180
Trump.
Trump thinks the economy is doing well.

2386
01:49:39,181 --> 01:49:40,430
He'll get another shot.
You know,

2387
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,300
it's not like.
You know what?

2388
01:49:42,301 --> 01:49:45,660
You know.
What I like about trump is the cia is so

2389
01:49:45,661 --> 01:49:47,620
against him.
like john dot brennan,

2390
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,570
the director,
he's the director of the cia.

2391
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:54,640
He's against him.
Then it's a good thing for brian to list

2392
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:57,980
some good about trump.
The fat guys against peo,

2393
01:49:58,010 --> 01:49:58,843
I believe.
What happened with this fella that used 

2394
01:50:00,551 --> 01:50:03,750
to be head of the cia is appointed by 
the president.

2395
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:05,800
It's a sibling.
Sibley and appoint appointment.

2396
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:06,663
Ujamaa brendan.
Right now you're usually a civilian who 

2397
01:50:08,141 --> 01:50:10,420
runs the cia and you're appointed by 
the,

2398
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,500
by.
The lady says John O'brien.

2399
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,320
John will brennan's the director,
right?

2400
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:16,500
It's a pump peo,
isn't it?

2401
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:21,800
Looked at was he was obama's director 
director.

2402
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:26,140
And he doesn't like the president.
Obama didn't like the problem.

2403
01:50:26,141 --> 01:50:28,390
Luckily you can punch that up,
put it into trump.

2404
01:50:28,391 --> 01:50:31,810
Trump appoints the head of the cia.
So he has his boy decided to.

2405
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:34,200
If he does,
he does.

2406
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,530
He just read it and said it and halpern 
hood.

2407
01:50:37,531 --> 01:50:39,640
The deputy director was,
uh,

2408
01:50:39,641 --> 01:50:42,130
under investigation for running black 
sites.

2409
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,290
So,
you know,

2410
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,000
if you wanT to talk about a 
controversial under secretary again,

2411
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:46,993
halpern is if valerie harper and she is,
she was not operative who ran a lot of 

2412
01:50:50,231 --> 01:50:51,064
the extraordinary rendition sites.
The black sites where a detainees under 

2413
01:50:54,971 --> 01:50:58,540
american supervision were tortured.
She ran that,

2414
01:50:58,541 --> 01:50:59,570
she was there.
She,

2415
01:50:59,571 --> 01:51:03,850
she was brought up with the senate arms,
the intelligence committee,

2416
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:05,133
and questioned.
What do you think it's like to bang a 

2417
01:51:06,941 --> 01:51:07,774
chick who runs a torture operation?
We better go hard and tried to look for 

2418
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:11,614
pictures.
I couldn't find pictures of hard in the 

2419
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:17,580
fucking pardon the paint.
Go hard in the paint chips.

2420
01:51:18,050 --> 01:51:23,050
He's a controversial character man,
but I'm not into dope.

2421
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:27,030
I don't scratch me.
Nobody.

2422
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:29,680
I'm not going to choke you out.
I can't shake.

2423
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:31,423
I don't like this.
50 shades of grey has got people 

2424
01:51:32,681 --> 01:51:33,514
confused as fuck.
Shades of brent's from working in a 

2425
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:38,350
fucking office.
That's what dutch shit's from.

2426
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:40,150
Correct.
Being suppressed.

2427
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:40,984
Work in the cubicle.
Constantly worried about human 

2428
01:51:42,101 --> 01:51:43,090
resources.
You get out of there.

2429
01:51:43,091 --> 01:51:44,920
He wants a bitch to tie you up and shit 
in your mouth.

2430
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:50,830
Dry data to dominate tricks.
Right?

2431
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,120
And uh,
in New York.

2432
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,313
Crazy dude,
she brought me to her quote unquote 

2433
01:51:54,701 --> 01:51:57,330
dungeon shelia fancy gimp suit.
No,

2434
01:51:57,331 --> 01:51:58,061
I,
she liked it.

2435
01:51:58,061 --> 01:52:00,460
That was kind of dominant because I 
don't know if you guys know I'm an alpha

2436
01:52:00,461 --> 01:52:01,294
male,
but she had a chair that I tell you 

2437
01:52:02,861 --> 01:52:03,490
this.
I did this.

2438
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:04,540
She had a tear.
Yeah.

2439
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:06,160
You could tie your balls.
Yeah,

2440
01:52:06,161 --> 01:52:06,994
go ahead.
You'd sit in a chair and theRe was a 

2441
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:11,980
hole in the chair and your balls and 
cock would hang between the chair.

2442
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:12,883
Oh,
I bet she would put a a a ring at the 

2443
01:52:15,941 --> 01:52:18,460
base of your life where you're cocking 
your balls,

2444
01:52:18,461 --> 01:52:19,294
meat and then you'd be chained to the 
floor and then she'd do whatever the 

2445
01:52:22,241 --> 01:52:25,390
fuck she wanted.
When she said that her biggest clientele

2446
01:52:25,391 --> 01:52:27,130
were all lawyers.
Mostly lawyers.

2447
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,050
There were something about lawyers like 
to be dominant.

2448
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,910
Did she kick you in the balls?
Be a.

2449
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:33,670
I didn't do with you today.
There's a lot of.

2450
01:52:33,671 --> 01:52:34,504
Those guys brought me there.
Sometimes they're super superintendent 

2451
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,230
seeing those videos.
brian,

2452
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:46,220
both they're guys.

2453
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:47,383
When I worked at the strip club as a dj,
there was guys that would come in and 

2454
01:52:50,421 --> 01:52:51,254
they would sit in the lap dance booth 
and want the girls in nam and the ball 

2455
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:58,040
fuck is wrong with them.
That was one a year.

2456
01:52:58,130 --> 01:52:59,860
Every year.
One free.

2457
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:01,760
Sure.
Some guys like to be caught.

2458
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:04,370
They liked to be electrocuted,
like to like to feel.

2459
01:53:04,371 --> 01:53:05,204
I think there's also some real 
scientific inquiry into this and they 

2460
01:53:09,261 --> 01:53:11,480
think there's some people feel pain 
differently.

2461
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:12,993
I mean if you're.
If you can be born with something wrong 

2462
01:53:16,731 --> 01:53:17,570
with your body,
right?

2463
01:53:17,571 --> 01:53:19,910
If you could be born with some sort of a
birth defect,

2464
01:53:19,911 --> 01:53:20,744
why can't you be born with some sort of 
a defect in the way your body senses 

2465
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:26,360
pain and apps?
We're just assuming like,

2466
01:53:26,361 --> 01:53:27,111
you know,
I don't like pain.

2467
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:28,070
You don't like pain.
He's like,

2468
01:53:28,071 --> 01:53:28,640
fuck payments.

2469
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,473
be off with everybody.
I think some people are numb and pain 

2470
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:36,710
gives them like a vital shot in the arm 
to let them know they're still alive.

2471
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,080
That's why people a lot of depressed 
people like tattoos.

2472
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:41,810
Yeah.
According to richard,

2473
01:53:41,811 --> 01:53:45,590
Richard Walter,
who's a big time profiler for sadism,

2474
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:47,900
he's guy wrote the double helix 
basically on,

2475
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:51,080
on serial killers and what makes,
how a serial killer becomes,

2476
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:53,510
you know,
and he solves a lot of these cold cases,

2477
01:53:53,511 --> 01:53:56,030
but he's an fbi profiler,
deals with the worst cases,

2478
01:53:56,031 --> 01:53:57,510
like the real,
the real estate.

2479
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:00,920
And he said every,
it's always so certain.

2480
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,000
So there,
there,

2481
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:04,670
there's certain people that get off on 
the act of killing,

2482
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:07,280
right?
And in fact they'll almost kill you then

2483
01:54:07,281 --> 01:54:08,960
bring it back to life.
The real sick fuckers.

2484
01:54:08,961 --> 01:54:13,040
But he said all of those people eat 
including cannibals and things.

2485
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:17,600
They all are getting a sexual charge out
of whatever it is.

2486
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,583
It is.
They Do.

2487
01:54:18,690 --> 01:54:20,990
So regardless,
it's not,

2488
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:24,350
it's power over the person,
but according to him,

2489
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:25,940
there's always,
yeah,

2490
01:54:25,941 --> 01:54:29,440
there's always a sexual drive for us.
So yeah,

2491
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:31,930
like the one guy who they found,
uh,

2492
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,100
this terry was a cannibal and he 
couldn't,

2493
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:36,500
he killed,
killed his two wives and they caught him

2494
01:54:36,510 --> 01:54:37,161
because he,
you know,

2495
01:54:37,161 --> 01:54:37,994
he just would do all these terrible 
things and he couldn't feel when you 

2496
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:42,260
found him,
he had add happens.

2497
01:54:42,261 --> 01:54:44,180
I think that this is in the forties,
fifties.

2498
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,880
They had hat pins in his ass and his 
balls.

2499
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:47,803
He had pins in his balls and hat pins 
stuffed in his ass and he was walking 

2500
01:54:51,681 --> 01:54:55,490
around and he said that basically he had
trouble feeling anything,

2501
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:56,653
anything.
And so he would stick these needles in 

2502
01:54:59,091 --> 01:55:01,070
his balls and they found him with 
that's.

2503
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:01,851
They're like,
wait,

2504
01:55:01,851 --> 01:55:02,780
why do you kill an eight people?

2505
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:04,000
You torture people.
What?

2506
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:05,900
Let's start with your mother.
Well wait a minute,

2507
01:55:05,930 --> 01:55:09,320
you got hat pins in your asshole.
Did you hear about the guy in Canada?

2508
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:10,154
Her balls brought the guy in Canada that
had a mental episode on a bus and they 

2509
01:55:13,621 --> 01:55:16,400
brought a knife with him in bags like 
plastic bags.

2510
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,640
Killed this guy cut his head off with a 
knife and then eight his eyeballs on the

2511
01:55:21,891 --> 01:55:23,590
bus beheaded,
a guy on a crowded bus.

2512
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:24,920
People on the bus,
they were sleeping.

2513
01:55:24,921 --> 01:55:27,480
It was late at night at this guys 
fucking head off eight his eyes,

2514
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:29,103
they deemed him mentally ill.
They gave him medication and they just 

2515
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:35,090
released them.
Hello Canada part of Canada,

2516
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:38,270
windsor can do shows.
Windsor,

2517
01:55:38,271 --> 01:55:39,350
ontario.
Where was it?

2518
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:42,410
Where was it says manitoba.
Manitoba,

2519
01:55:42,411 --> 01:55:43,560
sorry.
Woke up.

2520
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:44,700
Toba.
Uh,

2521
01:55:44,701 --> 01:55:46,830
I don't know if people woke up or not,
but there was,

2522
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,870
there was cops that were outside while 
he was.

2523
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,270
The guy was already dead and he was 
eating.

2524
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:54,930
There was cops and first responders that
wound up committing suicide apparently.

2525
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:56,610
See if that's true,
but that's what I had read,

2526
01:55:56,611 --> 01:55:57,444
that it was such a gruesome horrific 
scene that some first responders 

2527
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:03,510
committed suicide,
but people like I,

2528
01:56:03,511 --> 01:56:05,850
I got in like debate with people online 
about this.

2529
01:56:05,851 --> 01:56:06,361
They're like,
look,

2530
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:09,300
he had a psychotic episode as long as he
takes his medication will be fine,

2531
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:10,471
and I was like,
well,

2532
01:56:10,471 --> 01:56:11,304
even if that's the case,
the fact that someone could ever in 

2533
01:56:14,221 --> 01:56:15,054
their existence and their time and their
consciousness on earth be capable of 

2534
01:56:17,821 --> 01:56:21,570
sawing someone's head off with a knife 
and then eating their eyeballs on a bus.

2535
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,890
you can't ever let them out of your 
sight because he never did that until he

2536
01:56:25,891 --> 01:56:26,724
did it once.
He never did that until he did it once 

2537
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,423
and then he did it once.

2538
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:32,160
Now you know he can do it,
so for you to let him go,

2539
01:56:32,161 --> 01:56:35,190
I don't care what you say about mental 
illness that is so irresponsible,

2540
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:37,200
irresponsible,
and not have a relapse.

2541
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:39,100
We don't know how to react to the 
medication.

2542
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:41,130
IT never happened before.
Then it happened,

2543
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:43,860
which means it can happen.
I feel the same way about pedophiles.

2544
01:56:44,150 --> 01:56:44,941
If you,
if you,

2545
01:56:44,941 --> 01:56:48,900
if you raped a child and you go through 
all the therapy in the world,

2546
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:50,620
I don't care.
I pay it.

2547
01:56:50,690 --> 01:56:51,523
I can't let you in.
The audience are so fucking nice 

2548
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:54,690
tonight.
That's what it is,

2549
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:59,130
that people ate the eyeballs and didn't 
know any better.

2550
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:02,070
He feels bad.
It feels super bad.

2551
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:07,500
my bat to the nice canadians are the 
nicest people I've ever come across.

2552
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,080
I think they're the nicest nature.
Pretty cool.

2553
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:12,570
They're amazing.
They're so fucking nice.

2554
01:57:12,670 --> 01:57:14,550
Yeah,
and that's how something like that flies

2555
01:57:14,551 --> 01:57:14,970
over there.

2556
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:19,170
They have a social justice warrior 
president or prime minister trudeau.

2557
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,980
He's hilarious,
like the refugees get sad.

2558
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:24,120
Do you know gavin?
Yeah.

2559
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,700
Well god has been,
you know,

2560
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:28,580
he lives up there in montreal.
He's a professor in montreal and he just

2561
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,573
highlights all the ridiculous policies 
that this guy keeps promoting and the 

2562
01:57:32,641 --> 01:57:34,950
stuff that he gets behind and the things
that he.

2563
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:35,933
I mean he,
he like what they're doing up there is 

2564
01:57:37,461 --> 01:57:38,490
like,
it's really strange.

2565
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:42,240
You can get arrested if you say things 
about certain people,

2566
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:44,660
like they don't have freedom of speech 
the way we have it.

2567
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:45,893
They have like these human rights 
councils that decide whether or not you 

2568
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:50,530
should be able to do shit.
Hey,

2569
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:54,930
so if you get heckled by some lesbians,
you call him a dirty dyke and say go eat

2570
01:57:54,931 --> 01:57:55,764
her asshole.
You dirty bitch or say something crazy 

2571
01:57:56,671 --> 01:57:57,210
like that.

2572
01:57:57,210 --> 01:58:02,210
You could get arrested and then sued and
lose and that happened in vancouver.

2573
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:03,493
He says there's lot.
They have crazy laws as far as like 

2574
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:11,950
using gender pronouns back that Jordan 
Peterson,

2575
01:58:12,110 --> 01:58:14,070
Jordan Pearson is a big part of that 
push back.

2576
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:15,113
Without him,
a lot of that would have just been 

2577
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:19,680
swallowed up by the academics.
He's one of the first academics to stand

2578
01:58:19,681 --> 01:58:20,880
up and go,
hey guys,

2579
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:21,803
this is fucking crazy and this is just 
controlling people and when you start 

2580
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:25,073
controlling people like this,
it goes down this dirty road and this 

2581
01:58:27,331 --> 01:58:28,164
dirty road is a dictator.
There's dirty road is like ideologies 

2582
01:58:32,401 --> 01:58:33,234
and dominating your patterns of speech 
and the whole marketplace of somebody 

2583
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,433
say genda exactly what the agenda of 
equality that great fuzzy in topeka and 

2584
01:58:42,131 --> 01:58:43,720
the sky and if you listen to Jordan 
Peterson,

2585
01:58:43,721 --> 01:58:46,720
he knows so much about marxism that it 
shows you like,

2586
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:49,060
oh,
this is a pattern of human thinking.

2587
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:52,750
It starts off by people that were really
well intentioned.

2588
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:55,270
they're intellectuals,
they're very kind,

2589
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,860
they're sympathetic,
they're progressive,

2590
01:58:56,861 --> 01:58:57,694
and they want everyone to be nice,
so one of the ways they do it is to be 

2591
01:59:00,941 --> 01:59:03,010
really evil to people they think are not
nice,

2592
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:04,083
and then you create this fucking war 
because they look at them as predators 

2593
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:10,690
and they're sort of like infantiles 
date.

2594
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:12,940
The problem is that people on the other 
side don't look at it that way.

2595
01:59:12,941 --> 01:59:13,774
So you're starting this thing and you're
creating to shored up defenses in walls 

2596
01:59:18,191 --> 01:59:19,280
of offense.
You,

2597
01:59:19,281 --> 01:59:20,560
you start,
you push in,

2598
01:59:20,710 --> 01:59:24,340
you start multisoft cocktail and 
universities that have given speeches by

2599
01:59:24,341 --> 01:59:26,300
guys who were republicans.
You create a like that.

2600
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:28,150
Uc Berkeley.
What happened with milo?

2601
01:59:28,590 --> 01:59:29,423
I didn't get pulled them out of the 
fucking building to save his life like 

2602
01:59:31,721 --> 01:59:34,630
people are writing.
Did $100,000

2603
01:59:34,631 --> 01:59:36,580
with a damage to the school forward 
thinking.

2604
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:37,413
I thought.
I thought berkeley was so tolerant on 

2605
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:41,280
what a surprise.
As long as you don't fire.

2606
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:42,183
They made cars.
Portland milo was there and so he got 

2607
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:47,480
shot sometimes shy by us.
Yeah,

2608
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:47,940
no,
it's,

2609
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:50,620
it's crazy and if you listen to what 
he's saying,

2610
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:52,090
he's saying some racist shit,
right?

2611
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:55,900
Not nothing compared to the reaction.
Then it's getting nothing.

2612
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:56,734
He's mostly a half of a troll.
He's like half of a comedian when he 

2613
02:00:00,231 --> 02:00:01,590
says things,
he's bitchy.

2614
02:00:01,710 --> 02:00:04,990
He's a bitchy gay guy,
the column a nazi and he's a fucking gay

2615
02:00:04,991 --> 02:00:07,660
jew.
It is one of the funniest things ever.

2616
02:00:07,661 --> 02:00:08,494
They're calling this guy nazi and a 
white supremacist slogan of his tour 

2617
02:00:10,801 --> 02:00:13,330
though.
It's 10th a dangerous faggot tour,

2618
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,070
but he,
he's gay,

2619
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:16,023
he's gay,
and he talks about his love of black 

2620
02:00:17,441 --> 02:00:18,610
dick.
You know,

2621
02:00:18,611 --> 02:00:22,900
he taLks about how the system,
he's a writer and a troll,

2622
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:27,040
but like an intelligent troll and a 
british guy who's got people on.

2623
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:32,100
If you look at what they said it was 
because he said a rude,

2624
02:00:32,261 --> 02:00:36,400
racist shit organized some sort of an 
attack on leslie jones,

2625
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,530
but he didn't do it.
Like,

2626
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:40,040
if you look at what he said,
if,

2627
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:44,470
if how responsible is someone who cracks
a joke about someone.

2628
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:47,110
Like he said something about leslie 
jones wouldn't be the first time I was.

2629
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:50,340
I was turned down by a black man,
like,

2630
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:53,590
like something along those lines like 
bitchy but funny.

2631
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:55,450
And for that,
just for that,

2632
02:00:55,451 --> 02:00:56,284
for saying that,
because she was mad at his review or 

2633
02:00:57,641 --> 02:00:58,474
something like that,
was his followers started sending her 

2634
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,960
horrible come maybe,
but what,

2635
02:01:01,961 --> 02:01:05,080
how much of that can you push onto him?
He can't control that.

2636
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:05,943
You can't control it.
So I'm not with what I'm saying is if 

2637
02:01:07,781 --> 02:01:11,350
you look at what he actually said,
if that's grounds for a band,

2638
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:13,390
we're dealing with some extreme 
censorship.

2639
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:16,210
So you've got to figure out like when is
he responsible?

2640
02:01:16,211 --> 02:01:17,560
So he did he say,
hey guys,

2641
02:01:17,561 --> 02:01:18,610
go get him.
no he didn't,

2642
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,950
but you know who did do that is leslie 
jones.

2643
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:22,083
There was a tweet where leslie jones,
someone was attacking her and she was 

2644
02:01:24,461 --> 02:01:26,260
like,
go get them to that person.

2645
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:27,490
Like to.
Which is like,

2646
02:01:27,491 --> 02:01:28,870
look,
that's her prerogative too.

2647
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,810
If you want to be a cut.
And started attacking this woman who's a

2648
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:34,290
very hilarious comedian for no reason.
She,

2649
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:35,323
I think she should be able to say fuck 
you and do it publicly and say go get 

2650
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:38,893
him her fence.
So my point is my low never said that 

2651
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:42,793
milo literally never said go get him,
but yet he was sort of held responsible 

2652
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:49,790
for things that other people said,
you can't.

2653
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:50,653
There's so many crazy people out there.
The idea that you can control them and 

2654
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:56,060
then you could just like say like people
who like bryan county,

2655
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:57,620
you are responsible for those people.

2656
02:01:57,770 --> 02:01:58,603
You have to set a good example.
We're going to kick you off our 

2657
02:01:59,661 --> 02:02:01,170
platform.
That's essentially what they're saying.

2658
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:04,580
Crazy sweared Their prerogative,
but pull up to what he asks.

2659
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:09,080
I think it's interesting.
you know that you're not going to change

2660
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:09,963
that.
We always have to remember that if you 

2661
02:02:10,821 --> 02:02:11,654
disagree with the other side,
the idea is to try to get them to agree 

2662
02:02:14,541 --> 02:02:15,374
with you or try to come up with some 
kind of a consensus so you can move 

2663
02:02:17,451 --> 02:02:18,284
ideas forward to move the world forward.
And what we have with this kind of 

2664
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:23,900
reaction to milo is if you're going to 
do $100,000

2665
02:02:23,901 --> 02:02:24,734
worth of damage in your protest,
well that's fine and milo have to be 

2666
02:02:27,681 --> 02:02:29,930
escorted out and you won't listen to 
them and you close your mind.

2667
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:32,870
You're not moving anything forward or 
making anything better though.

2668
02:02:32,871 --> 02:02:34,910
You're juSt creating a big old division.

2669
02:02:35,270 --> 02:02:38,000
And I guess you guys can stay in your 
echo chamber.

2670
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:38,853
They all stay in their echo chamber and 
nobody will listen to each other and we 

2671
02:02:40,851 --> 02:02:41,684
won't learn anything.
Well that's just a product of being 

2672
02:02:43,821 --> 02:02:44,654
raised in this system,
this two party system and this 

2673
02:02:47,301 --> 02:02:51,170
ridiculous idea that there's us and them
and now that they're in,

2674
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:52,191
there's this,
you know,

2675
02:02:52,191 --> 02:02:54,830
all people have to fight back and you 
have to punch nazis.

2676
02:02:54,990 --> 02:02:56,630
So this crazy shit that people are 
saying.

2677
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:59,180
But when you listen to what milo 
actually says,

2678
02:02:59,181 --> 02:03:01,550
even if you disagree with them,
which I do all the time,

2679
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,140
like I disagree witH a lot of what he's 
saying.

2680
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:05,540
Ha,
there's sam harris put it best.

2681
02:03:05,541 --> 02:03:07,670
He's like,
half of it is like a performance.

2682
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:08,923
It's like he seems insincere a lot of 
the times and he's very acutely aware 

2683
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:12,884
that is generating response and the 
things that he's saying that they're 

2684
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:16,320
like,
you know,

2685
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:18,850
that they're saying that he's racist or 
he's just,

2686
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:23,060
it's terrible white nationalists or 
something like this is just making stuff

2687
02:03:23,061 --> 02:03:26,870
up so that they can start attacking him 
more freely because it's easier.

2688
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:28,610
What he said is definitely 
controversial.

2689
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:31,700
Controversial he said is some of it is 
definitely rude.

2690
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:34,640
Some of it is preposterous.
Some of it doesn't make any sense.

2691
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:37,040
Like he's,
he's pro circumcision because he doesn't

2692
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:38,960
want dicks to have extra skin hanging 
off of him.

2693
02:03:38,961 --> 02:03:41,270
He says he'll fight with you about it.
You know,

2694
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:42,020
he's,
he's,

2695
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:43,820
he's a catholic.
I think he is.

2696
02:03:43,821 --> 02:03:44,410
I'm like,
okay.

2697
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:46,070
I Believe that.
He's like,

2698
02:03:46,071 --> 02:03:48,170
absolutely,
catholicism is the best religion.

2699
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:49,650
it's the moSt amazing religion.
I'm super,

2700
02:03:49,690 --> 02:03:50,540
like,
he's crazy.

2701
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:52,393
Okay.
So you started making in front of jones 

2702
02:03:53,331 --> 02:03:54,950
and we wrote an article.
First of all,

2703
02:03:54,951 --> 02:03:57,020
let's say one thing that he wrote an 
article,

2704
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:59,540
uh,
where he did a horrible,

2705
02:03:59,810 --> 02:04:02,810
mean critique of the new ghost busters 
for women.

2706
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:03,853
and he said essentially that it was like
a feminist film and he pointed out some 

2707
02:04:06,381 --> 02:04:07,250
really important shit.
He's like,

2708
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:10,490
every guy in the movie is a fucking 
idiot and every woman's saves the world.

2709
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:12,050
And he's like,
it's kind of ridiculous.

2710
02:04:12,051 --> 02:04:14,330
So he,
he says,

2711
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:15,573
I'm so he writes this.
So she was getting hate mail from his 

2712
02:04:17,841 --> 02:04:19,520
response,
I guess from his thing,

2713
02:04:19,521 --> 02:04:22,220
racial abuse that she was getting.
And he said,

2714
02:04:22,221 --> 02:04:24,800
everyone gets hate mail for fuck's for 
fuck sake.

2715
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:28,460
One tweet read another one called jones,
barely literate.

2716
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:31,250
Later,
she shared fake screenshots.

2717
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,173
Oh,
he shared frakes screenshots that made 

2718
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:34,124
it appear of jones.
We're making profane and offensive 

2719
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:39,440
postings.
Twitter didn't saY exactly why it band.

2720
02:04:39,441 --> 02:04:40,274
He annapolis only telling breitbart 
writer that he was permanently banned 

2721
02:04:42,721 --> 02:04:46,590
for violation of the company's rules 
prohibiting participation in or exciting

2722
02:04:46,591 --> 02:04:50,730
targeted use of individuals.
So what makes that like,

2723
02:04:50,731 --> 02:04:51,564
okay,
I could see like if he was post 

2724
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,820
retweeting things that,
that were very rude,

2725
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,070
I would love to see what those things 
were.

2726
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,890
Probably pretty see how rude they were.
Maybe they were silly.

2727
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,480
they were racist.
They were bad,

2728
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:07,720
they were bad,
they were crazy.

2729
02:05:07,721 --> 02:05:11,310
They're all making it appear.
That was jones link there,

2730
02:05:11,311 --> 02:05:12,500
jamie.
Scroll back down.

2731
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,790
See where it says it.
Made it appear of jones.

2732
02:05:14,791 --> 02:05:17,310
We're making profane and offensive 
postings.

2733
02:05:17,311 --> 02:05:20,430
Click on that.
Let's see what it looks like.

2734
02:05:20,431 --> 02:05:22,020
What it.
What was actually said.

2735
02:05:23,970 --> 02:05:24,870
This was not me.
Okay.

2736
02:05:24,871 --> 02:05:25,950
Okay.
Uncle tom.

2737
02:05:25,951 --> 02:05:29,780
Fag nero needs to get his racist ass 
out.

2738
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:30,623
My mentions shit like this makes me 
think we need to gas these goddamn 

2739
02:05:34,981 --> 02:05:35,820
faggots to death.
Okay,

2740
02:05:35,821 --> 02:05:37,950
so that's not really her fake.
Yeah.

2741
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:41,130
Somebody made a fake.
That's kind of fucked up to do to leslie

2742
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,060
jones.
Terrible.

2743
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:43,380
Well,
how do we know?

2744
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:45,990
Okay.
You got to assume that he knew that that

2745
02:05:45,991 --> 02:05:46,824
wasn't him.
He posted one that that wasn't her 

2746
02:05:47,911 --> 02:05:48,570
brother.
Right.

2747
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:49,321
But hold on,
hold on,

2748
02:05:49,321 --> 02:05:50,210
hold on.
We got.

2749
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:50,880
Assume that.

2750
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,050
Go back to that again,
jamie.

2751
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:54,800
you got to assume that he knew that that
wasn't really hard.

2752
02:05:54,801 --> 02:05:55,634
Right?
You don't think that he really thought 

2753
02:05:56,581 --> 02:05:58,800
she wrote that.
so if he retweets that,

2754
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:01,250
if that's a fake account,
what's the dif?

2755
02:06:01,270 --> 02:06:03,520
Okay,
so it's just a photo that someone put it

2756
02:06:03,521 --> 02:06:06,060
or did he.
Someone else did it and he tweeted it.

2757
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:07,920
He retweeted it,
I guess.

2758
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:09,900
Okay.
So let's see what the other ones are.

2759
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:12,480
Although it says it looks like it's 
verified as well as dog.

2760
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:16,570
Did he retweet this?
If someone sent it to him and he.

2761
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,610
He retweeted it.
Okay.

2762
02:06:17,611 --> 02:06:20,370
Here's one less dog.
You're ghostbusters just in the first to

2763
02:06:20,371 --> 02:06:21,810
have an opening.
Oh shit.

2764
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:24,130
Super racist.
Whoa.

2765
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:26,190
It's awful.
So he retweeted that.

2766
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:27,930
He retweeted that.
Okay.

2767
02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:28,980
Yeah,
that's not cool.

2768
02:06:29,310 --> 02:06:31,030
That's pretty fucking rude.
Okay.

2769
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:31,990
What,
what else we got?

2770
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:32,540
That's,
that's,

2771
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:35,260
that's,
that's just shitty man that I not like.

2772
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,050
Just that makes me want to put this on 
him.

2773
02:06:37,051 --> 02:06:39,300
He's definitely got some issues.
She's lashing,

2774
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:42,510
he's got some fucking issues.
We were good.

2775
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:43,470
We get it.
You get it.

2776
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:44,813
Well that's.
He's definitely got some issues like 

2777
02:06:45,961 --> 02:06:47,280
that.
That's not a cool thing to do,

2778
02:06:47,610 --> 02:06:51,570
but what he's doing,
he insights talk and because of that,

2779
02:06:51,571 --> 02:06:54,600
his.
His book is now number one on the amazon

2780
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:55,753
piece trying to accomplish what's the 
book property sale and no one knows it 

2781
02:06:59,611 --> 02:07:01,020
has books not even out yet.
Yeah.

2782
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,080
It's really,
really interesting guy in a lot of ways.

2783
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:06,210
He's very smart.
I talked to him off air.

2784
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:08,580
He's a very intelligent guy.
He's very cordial,

2785
02:07:08,581 --> 02:07:09,414
very good to talk to.
I really enjoyed talking to him and we 

2786
02:07:11,551 --> 02:07:12,384
joked around a lot when we did the 
podcast together because I grilled them 

2787
02:07:14,371 --> 02:07:16,770
about certain things I think are 
ridiculous and eventually gives them.

2788
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:19,950
Starts laughing with you.
He's a very smart guy,

2789
02:07:19,951 --> 02:07:20,784
but I don't know what he's doing.
I don't know if this is a real as the 

2790
02:07:23,101 --> 02:07:23,934
real him or if this is him doing a 
performance or if it's combination of 

2791
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:27,054
both or if he's finding himself in the 
midst of this hurricane of negativity 

2792
02:07:30,331 --> 02:07:31,164
and popularity,
which would it be just assuming that 

2793
02:07:32,821 --> 02:07:35,830
he's bullet proof that he can't be 
influenced by this fucking crazy or deal

2794
02:07:35,831 --> 02:07:36,010
that he's

2795
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:38,500
going through and occasionally do shit 
that he shouldn't have done.

2796
02:07:38,501 --> 02:07:41,110
like reposting some horrible racist 
thing.

2797
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:43,750
He's young.
I mean he's maybe 30 something.

2798
02:07:43,751 --> 02:07:45,610
Right?
How old is he made a point.

2799
02:07:45,611 --> 02:07:46,444
That's a really interesting point you 
just said that made about if this is 

2800
02:07:48,821 --> 02:07:50,790
like in transition like so.
Sure he is.

2801
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:51,633
He's a growing just like all of us are 
and even like it depends on how you can 

2802
02:07:54,311 --> 02:07:55,144
catch somebody in,
in a moment where they can sound if you 

2803
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:01,030
already sound like themselves.
So he's young.

2804
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:03,430
He's fucking smart dude.
I'm telling you.

2805
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:04,740
I believe it.
I just feel like,

2806
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:05,593
yeah,
I definitely disagree With retweeting 

2807
02:08:06,551 --> 02:08:09,490
that racist picture of leslie jones 
looking like a gorilla.

2808
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:12,640
This one guy who said something,
he was at the when,

2809
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:16,150
what was the theater in France that they
shot up during a performance?

2810
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:18,330
He was in the band,
I believe christ.

2811
02:08:18,610 --> 02:08:20,310
Remember when?
When those guys opened fire,

2812
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:25,360
the fatal famous famous,
yeah,

2813
02:08:25,361 --> 02:08:26,080
death,
metal,

2814
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:26,913
whatever.
And he said something about islam right 

2815
02:08:30,971 --> 02:08:31,950
after that.
He was like,

2816
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:32,813
he's in and he was emotional and people 
had died and it was this concert and he 

2817
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:40,360
saw some all kinds of stuff and he said 
something that they picked up and he did

2818
02:08:40,361 --> 02:08:41,194
an inteRview because they just did a 
documentary on it and he said something 

2819
02:08:43,481 --> 02:08:44,980
really interesting.
They said,

2820
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:48,640
you said something about islam,
do you have any regret about that?

2821
02:08:48,641 --> 02:08:50,050
And it was pretty racist.
And he saId,

2822
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:50,770
alright,
well look,

2823
02:08:50,770 --> 02:08:52,630
first of all,
I love people.

2824
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:53,493
We have a lot of muslims fans and 
anything else said what happened there 

2825
02:08:56,081 --> 02:08:59,410
was my emotions were so heightened and 
there was a,

2826
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:00,573
there was a,
there was a span of time where I was 

2827
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,473
thinking in a very emotional,
uncharacteristic way that I usually am 

2828
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:11,950
my.
I had,

2829
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:16,210
I was hot off of something tragic and I 
didn't even know how to make sense of it

2830
02:09:16,590 --> 02:09:17,423
to.
I don't want you to reread what I said 

2831
02:09:18,941 --> 02:09:22,870
because that's not who I am,
but in that sliver of time,

2832
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,810
that's how I was feeling and I lashed 
out in paint.

2833
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:29,080
It's very honest way of putting it is 
and I thought that that's why we have to

2834
02:09:29,081 --> 02:09:29,914
be careful about taking quotes and then 
applying that to a peRson's entire 

2835
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:34,353
character.

2836
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:38,860
This was a guy in the band after he.
He said something about islam,

2837
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:40,420
but.
But it made me think about that.

2838
02:09:40,421 --> 02:09:41,254
We do this all the time where we say,
you said that one thing you said a 

2839
02:09:43,061 --> 02:09:44,110
sentence,
let's,

2840
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:47,440
let's highlight that and let's just say 
that's who the man is.

2841
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:48,970
You know,
you gotta be careful.

2842
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:51,700
So sometimes you'll be held accountable 
for what you're tweeting.

2843
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:53,740
You're doing well.
We can't always give everyone a pass,

2844
02:09:53,741 --> 02:09:55,270
but all he's just going through a rough 
time.

2845
02:09:55,271 --> 02:09:57,700
It's all good.
It's held accountable too.

2846
02:09:57,701 --> 02:09:59,260
That's true too.
That's true too,

2847
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:02,860
but we also have to recognize that like 
at 33 years of age,

2848
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:04,280
especially,
dude,

2849
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:05,133
I was a moron when I was 33 and if I had
gotten drunk and I decided to retweet 

2850
02:10:08,441 --> 02:10:09,274
some shit,
thank god twitter wasn't arounD theN I 

2851
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:13,510
want to say the student is that young 
and if he's a smart,

2852
02:10:13,511 --> 02:10:15,340
yes it is.
We say stupid shit all the time.

2853
02:10:15,380 --> 02:10:16,830
Who was doing stupid shit.
I've know.

2854
02:10:16,890 --> 02:10:19,370
Retweet anything raCist.
Thirty three.

2855
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:21,190
Oh,
you're not racist,

2856
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:23,530
but with him,
this is a pattern.

2857
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:26,250
Maybe you don't get a free.
Here's the thing,

2858
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:27,093
man.
He's his whole thing is courting 

2859
02:10:29,021 --> 02:10:29,854
controversy.
That's essentially what he's doing by 

2860
02:10:31,661 --> 02:10:33,980
saying feminism is cancer.
He's

2861
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:34,813
organizing a fistfight,
he's calling them out and he's 

2862
02:10:36,861 --> 02:10:39,950
organizing a verbal fiscal saves 
probably on adderall,

2863
02:10:39,951 --> 02:10:40,784
so he's talking to 100 miles an hour.
He's really articulate and he's gay and 

2864
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:45,044
he looks fabulous and he's got bleached 
blonde hair and he wears clothes and 

2865
02:10:48,411 --> 02:10:49,910
when he's killing it,
like on stage,

2866
02:10:49,911 --> 02:10:50,744
he's a very good orator.
So he's engaging them in these debates 

2867
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:55,910
that he's got carefully thought out,
responses,

2868
02:10:56,120 --> 02:11:00,060
carefully thought out sentences.
He definitely knows what he's doing.

2869
02:11:00,550 --> 02:11:01,383
He definitely knows what he's talking.
How was your conversation with Henry 

2870
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:06,530
Rollins?
Speaking of articles,

2871
02:11:06,531 --> 02:11:08,950
kitten little pony with this racism 
thing.

2872
02:11:09,770 --> 02:11:11,330
Oh,
I love that.

2873
02:11:11,331 --> 02:11:13,250
He's a good looking guy.
Handsome fellow.

2874
02:11:13,251 --> 02:11:15,440
Hell yeah.
It's profound love of black dick.

2875
02:11:15,441 --> 02:11:16,274
He talks about all the time,
which is also one more way that they 

2876
02:11:18,321 --> 02:11:22,730
have a hard time attacking him because 
he's a gay jew that loves black dick.

2877
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:24,530
Like he's got the spectrum covered.
He's like,

2878
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:27,110
there's a triangle sensibility that's 
around him.

2879
02:11:29,690 --> 02:11:34,060
Brian's.
These are good talking.

2880
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:40,080
One time brian know you're all right 
man.

2881
02:11:42,670 --> 02:11:44,150
I think you can't.
This is.

2882
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:47,750
This is what fascism is.
You can't enforce your view of the world

2883
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:48,584
on people through violence because 
that's what you're doing when you're a 

2884
02:11:50,181 --> 02:11:52,400
fascist and that's what people need to 
understand.

2885
02:11:52,401 --> 02:11:55,670
Like you can't just use the word fascist
when it applies to right wing people.

2886
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:57,680
If you're keeping people from 
communicating,

2887
02:11:57,710 --> 02:11:58,543
you're keeping a gay jew from talking 
shit on your stage and you can't just 

2888
02:12:01,491 --> 02:12:04,100
counter what he saying with someone 
who's better at talking shit.

2889
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:05,053
That is better points.
So instead you want to throw a chair 

2890
02:12:06,981 --> 02:12:09,110
through the window at fucking starbucks.
Look,

2891
02:12:09,111 --> 02:12:10,860
stop.
You guys are fascist,

2892
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:13,250
fascist.
Even if you think you're right,

2893
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:15,680
the way you're doing it is 100 percent 
wrong.

2894
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:18,800
This isn't the guys on a nazi.
He's not someone who's,

2895
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:21,380
even if he has said a racist thing in 
the past,

2896
02:12:21,381 --> 02:12:22,370
he's not the first.

2897
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:24,560
Every fucking comedian has said racist 
shit.

2898
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:27,800
let's Dog herself had a bunch of racist 
shit.

2899
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:31,130
They pulled off her twitter page.
We don't hate her for that.

2900
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:32,690
She had a bunch of shit about white 
people.

2901
02:12:32,691 --> 02:12:35,420
Just generalizing about white people in 
general.

2902
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:38,570
If you ever did that about black people,
you would get blackballed from hollywood

2903
02:12:38,571 --> 02:12:39,404
for life of course.
But we will allow a certain amount of 

2904
02:12:41,811 --> 02:12:45,290
stupid shit to come out of people's 
mouths if we think that you're not a bad

2905
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:46,071
person.
Yeah,

2906
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:46,904
and if you disagree,
if you disagree wiTh somebody where you 

2907
02:12:48,291 --> 02:12:49,400
beat it,
I'll say it again.

2908
02:12:49,401 --> 02:12:52,580
The way you beat a bad idea is with 
which you don't do,

2909
02:12:52,581 --> 02:12:55,760
is you don't start this fucking meme of 
punch nazis.

2910
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:58,490
like everybody keeps saying punch nazis 
like,

2911
02:12:58,491 --> 02:13:01,650
don't say that.
You're talking shit on there though.

2912
02:13:03,730 --> 02:13:04,563
You see that girl get maced in the face 
and the girl with the shit up make 

2913
02:13:06,891 --> 02:13:07,724
bitcoin great again hat and they came up
at mesa mesa in the face because it 

2914
02:13:10,971 --> 02:13:13,430
looked like a make America great again.
She fucked up.

2915
02:13:13,570 --> 02:13:16,160
it doesn't matter man.
They fucked up.

2916
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:19,820
Guy peter in the head with a sign and 
another guy macer in the face.

2917
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:24,380
The ruthless to they weren't ruthless 
with is our boy jake shields.

2918
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:27,530
He was at the protest that didn't get 
maced.

2919
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:29,980
He's lucky to get maced in the face on 
the trailer.

2920
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:31,770
You need more.
You need more than mace to fight.

2921
02:13:31,771 --> 02:13:35,730
Jake shields got problem with macy's.
You can't see.

2922
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:37,350
And if people just jump on you,
you can't look.

2923
02:13:37,351 --> 02:13:38,670
Jacob,
probably jack,

2924
02:13:38,671 --> 02:13:39,504
90 percent of them that come anywhere 
near him you can't see and someone hits 

2925
02:13:42,331 --> 02:13:43,560
you over the back of the head with 
something.

2926
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:44,393
Yeah.
These fucking people are doing exactly 

2927
02:13:46,501 --> 02:13:48,390
what they would hate.
And when I see people,

2928
02:13:48,391 --> 02:13:49,224
like there's people that are calling out
for who they're calling out for a 

2929
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:53,910
military coup,
they're calling out for them.

2930
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:54,923
I've seen more than one person say this,
like the military needs to step in and 

2931
02:13:57,841 --> 02:13:58,950
take our country back.
And I'm like,

2932
02:13:59,100 --> 02:13:59,933
holy shit,
this is patrick swayze movie from the 

2933
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:03,383
eighties.
They're thinking exactly the way of 

2934
02:14:04,401 --> 02:14:07,650
fastest would or a tyrant would.
They just have a different target.

2935
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:08,533
But that's what I always say to people.
It's amazing how many people think 

2936
02:14:11,281 --> 02:14:14,170
exactly like their enemy,
exactly like their enemy.

2937
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:16,980
I want to kill all of them or whatever.
And yet they're just.

2938
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:19,080
The only difference is they have a 
different target.

2939
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:21,630
But it's crazy when you have a 
legitimate contest,

2940
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:22,493
right?
You had a legitimate popularity contest 

2941
02:14:23,731 --> 02:14:26,370
and one guy wins and you're not happy 
that the guy wins.

2942
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:29,550
So you want to start riots like you 
might.

2943
02:14:29,610 --> 02:14:33,300
You might have fucked up and not voted,
or you might not have done such good job

2944
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:35,430
picking a candidate or you might have 
had the wrong campaign,

2945
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:38,700
but you have to accept when someone 
wins.

2946
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:41,370
Otherwise there's no fucking point.
And having his contest,

2947
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:44,820
we have this contest every four years 
and if you don't accept to one,

2948
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:47,040
as long as it's not this,
the cheating,

2949
02:14:47,041 --> 02:14:50,100
whatever the cheating happened,
it probably happened on both sides.

2950
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:54,810
Whatever legal shit they got away with 
whatever shenanigans and the pr they did

2951
02:14:54,811 --> 02:14:56,300
to him with the whole,
uh,

2952
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:57,840
grab them by the pussy thing and all 
that.

2953
02:14:57,841 --> 02:14:58,350
I mean,
there's,

2954
02:14:58,350 --> 02:15:00,720
there's a tax left and right on both 
sides.

2955
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:02,970
He came out ahead.
People aren't happy.

2956
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:04,470
I might understand that people aren't 
happy,

2957
02:15:04,471 --> 02:15:05,304
but you can't think that you can start a
riot now because you didn't want him to 

2958
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:09,510
be in there.

2959
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:13,320
They had a stupid fucking contest.
he won stupid fucking contest.

2960
02:15:13,410 --> 02:15:14,243
The problem is you're having a stupid 
fucking contests to see who runs the 

2961
02:15:16,621 --> 02:15:18,840
world.
And also it's important to have a little

2962
02:15:18,841 --> 02:15:21,300
compassion for the other side in this 
terms.

2963
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:22,283
Like I constantly hear trump voters 
being characterized as homophobes 

2964
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:26,123
rednecks,
dumb hillbillies and all that stuff 

2965
02:15:28,190 --> 02:15:29,790
because they're in there.
They're in the mix.

2966
02:15:29,791 --> 02:15:31,420
There's always there.
And they're there.

2967
02:15:31,421 --> 02:15:34,350
They're in the mixing on both sides,
the categories.

2968
02:15:34,351 --> 02:15:35,184
Here's the thing,
it might also be worth taking a little 

2969
02:15:37,321 --> 02:15:40,020
bit of a human approach and looking at 
trump voters and um,

2970
02:15:40,021 --> 02:15:40,854
maybe a lot of trump voters may be a lot
of trump voters who are good people 

2971
02:15:43,261 --> 02:15:47,100
didn't like trump that much either,
but they liked hillary way less or maybe

2972
02:15:47,101 --> 02:15:50,190
hillary's talking the way obama has been
for the past eight years and their lives

2973
02:15:50,191 --> 02:15:53,220
haven't changed for,
and they were desperate to seat anything

2974
02:15:53,221 --> 02:15:53,430
else.

2975
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:54,263
Work,
be a little compassionate on why a lot 

2976
02:15:56,341 --> 02:15:57,174
of people voted for trump because 
remember this country voted a black 

2977
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:02,100
president in and a lot of those voters 
were white,

2978
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,050
uh,
t two times in a row.

2979
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:06,150
Well,
but in order for him to have one,

2980
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:10,650
you have to have some people that voted 
for obama last term that voted for trump

2981
02:16:10,651 --> 02:16:11,484
this.
correct.

2982
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,443
There's a lot of people that thought it 
would be a better thing to have him 

2983
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:15,990
other than her.
Yeah.

2984
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:18,090
so there were no racist.
They're not all,

2985
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:19,570
you know,
homophobes they,

2986
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:20,413
they were.
That's why I was always really careful 

2987
02:16:21,331 --> 02:16:22,950
about.
I was always critical of trump.

2988
02:16:22,951 --> 02:16:23,784
I was very careful not to be critical of
trump voters because you know there are 

2989
02:16:26,991 --> 02:16:27,824
a lot,
but you're not being honest because 

2990
02:16:28,471 --> 02:16:30,880
there are dummies in there too,
just like there's dummies in the.

2991
02:16:30,881 --> 02:16:32,280
Hillary cannot present there on this.

2992
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,123
That's why those stereotypes exist.
When you talk about the latte sipping 

2993
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:37,084
hillary supporters who literally know 
nothing about what the negative things 

2994
02:16:39,781 --> 02:16:40,614
she's Done.
If you say anything about or you're a 

2995
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:42,303
sexist,
I mean there's a lot of that going on 

2996
02:16:43,691 --> 02:16:44,524
too.
Those are real people like the real 

2997
02:16:45,881 --> 02:16:47,530
ridiculous people on the left and the 
right.

2998
02:16:47,531 --> 02:16:48,670
They're all real.
You know,

2999
02:16:48,671 --> 02:16:50,510
so the hillbillies that love trump.
Look dude,

3000
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:51,191
I've seen it,
man.

3001
02:16:51,191 --> 02:16:55,060
I saw a video where this guy got pulled 
over in an altercation with this guy hit

3002
02:16:55,061 --> 02:16:55,894
and this other guy had gotten some sort 
of a traffic altercation and this guy 

3003
02:16:58,631 --> 02:16:59,464
comes uP to his window.
He's calling them the n word and he's 

3004
02:17:01,561 --> 02:17:02,261
saying,
trump,

3005
02:17:02,261 --> 02:17:03,130
man,
I'm with trump.

3006
02:17:03,131 --> 02:17:03,964
Trump's president now.
And it's that type of person that like 

3007
02:17:07,090 --> 02:17:07,923
there.
There are people like that that want to 

3008
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:12,033
let you know that this is their guy now 
because they're white and that this is 

3009
02:17:15,731 --> 02:17:16,750
like a racist thing.

3010
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:17,613
You think their races winning.
Think there was kkk people that voted 

3011
02:17:20,321 --> 02:17:24,260
for hillary,
like a special group kkk for hillary.

3012
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:28,060
The kkk people are there like.
Let's be honest,

3013
02:17:28,061 --> 02:17:30,510
how many just straight up racists and 
how many kkk?

3014
02:17:30,511 --> 02:17:35,511
P 2000 official kkk takes.
There are a lot of 200,000.

3015
02:17:37,511 --> 02:17:38,344
I thought I saw that sounds.
I wouldn't doubt if there was a million 

3016
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,513
in the south.
I think there's definitely probably a 

3017
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:48,820
million racists.
I'm trying to fish clan members.

3018
02:17:49,330 --> 02:17:52,480
Joining an organization's on knowing how
many ufc fans are.

3019
02:17:52,481 --> 02:17:53,314
There is a lot,
but if you had to join an organization 

3020
02:17:54,581 --> 02:17:57,270
to be a ufc fan will be far less of us 
mean buying the paper,

3021
02:17:57,271 --> 02:18:00,070
review the hood and go to a fucking 
flame.

3022
02:18:00,510 --> 02:18:02,530
Had to go to a bonfire.
5,000.

3023
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:05,890
What more than 40 different clan groups 
exist.

3024
02:18:05,891 --> 02:18:08,070
Many having multiple chapters or clavier
burns.

3025
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:12,190
That's cute and cute and a few that a 
presence in a large number of states.

3026
02:18:12,191 --> 02:18:13,024
There are over a hunDred different klan 
chapters around the country with the 

3027
02:18:14,791 --> 02:18:15,624
combined strength in members and 
associates that made total around 

3028
02:18:17,861 --> 02:18:19,810
$5,000.
Oh my god.

3029
02:18:19,811 --> 02:18:21,350
they're a little bigger than 10th 
planet.

3030
02:18:23,470 --> 02:18:28,470
Bigger.
That is so crazy.

3031
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:31,570
I don't even know if they're smart 
enough to be anything.

3032
02:18:31,571 --> 02:18:32,404
I think that they are.
A lot of times People are just sort of 

3033
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:38,200
guys who want to be part of a group and 
you know,

3034
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:39,910
they.
They've been told something,

3035
02:18:39,911 --> 02:18:40,744
they don't do any research and they're 
just dicks and there a lot of just 

3036
02:18:43,631 --> 02:18:45,670
shitheads who want to be part of a hate 
group.

3037
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:46,663
A lot of problem with black versus white
is the same problem as left versus 

3038
02:18:49,571 --> 02:18:51,240
right.
Black versus white,

3039
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:53,530
left versus right.
Share that fucking team thing,

3040
02:18:53,531 --> 02:18:54,364
man.
They share that team thing and white 

3041
02:18:55,301 --> 02:18:57,070
people want to think that they're on one
team.

3042
02:18:57,460 --> 02:18:58,293
Black people want to think they're on 
another team and we fuck each other up 

3043
02:19:00,401 --> 02:19:02,020
doing that.
It's so human.

3044
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:02,890
Human,
human,

3045
02:19:02,890 --> 02:19:04,960
human beings are very tribal.
I mean,

3046
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:06,550
anthropologists tell you that all the 
time,

3047
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:07,700
that human beings are tribal.

3048
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:09,640
EveryThing.
It's about time,

3049
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:12,340
like this generation is cut that shit.
No,

3050
02:19:12,610 --> 02:19:14,140
this is literally not.
What do you mean?

3051
02:19:14,141 --> 02:19:15,760
But I'll tell you,
I don't think it's aBout time.

3052
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:17,770
You know,
with jared diamond who's,

3053
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,240
who wrote guns,
germs and steel,

3054
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:20,350
great,
amazing guy.

3055
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:24,550
And he Said that he fascinating that 
when they were studying different tribes

3056
02:19:24,551 --> 02:19:27,070
in papa new Guinea that had been 
isolated so they were,

3057
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:29,210
they weren't really influenced By 
western culture at all.

3058
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:30,553
And what would happen was they have two 
tribeS that would get along really well 

3059
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:36,380
and they even inner married and you 
know,

3060
02:19:36,381 --> 02:19:37,214
they,
they shared things and everything else 

3061
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:39,014
and as soon as there became scarce 
resources like water or game and one 

3062
02:19:45,531 --> 02:19:48,200
side's very existence started to get 
threatened for.

3063
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:49,063
So for example,
maybe this one tribes closer to a water 

3064
02:19:51,171 --> 02:19:53,990
source and the other water source dried 
up.

3065
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:56,900
So what'll happen is it's really 
amazing.

3066
02:19:56,900 --> 02:20:01,670
It's very quickly the tribes will start 
making up stories about each other.

3067
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:02,713
Yeah.
We've talked about this before on 

3068
02:20:03,291 --> 02:20:05,750
another podcast.
Know we talked about this,

3069
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:06,633
you talked about how they decided in a 
very short amount of time the other 

3070
02:20:09,321 --> 02:20:10,570
people were bad and they went over and 
kill.

3071
02:20:10,571 --> 02:20:12,140
Yeah.
So I think that's human nature,

3072
02:20:12,141 --> 02:20:13,700
man.
And I think when you start talking about

3073
02:20:13,970 --> 02:20:15,290
getting along,
getting along,

3074
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:18,170
you can't afford certain people you can 
know.

3075
02:20:18,171 --> 02:20:20,990
That's the whole point.
Like right now,

3076
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:22,273
life has never been easier.
So what I'm saying is it's about time 

3077
02:20:24,891 --> 02:20:29,300
that this generation like figure out the
people are just people that it's fucking

3078
02:20:29,301 --> 02:20:32,570
stupid for all redheaded people to join 
together and form clan,

3079
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:34,760
you know,
fellow people working.

3080
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:37,430
I agree with that.
It's just getting through.

3081
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:38,640
It is,
it,

3082
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:39,473
is it,
it's more getting through today I think 

3083
02:20:41,331 --> 02:20:43,720
than ever before in history because 
there's one that,

3084
02:20:43,721 --> 02:20:44,090
right?

3085
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:44,810
Yeah.
Because it's like,

3086
02:20:44,810 --> 02:20:48,140
even like if you go back and watch those
old bugs bunny cartoons,

3087
02:20:48,380 --> 02:20:53,380
you know which ones they don't show 
something that's funded by your will.

3088
02:20:54,650 --> 02:20:55,483
They don't show that dude that much.
I bet they showed a lot and they don't 

3089
02:20:57,021 --> 02:20:57,854
show.
They don't show pepe le pew fogbugz 

3090
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:03,680
rapists gun ugly feeling.
That's gunk is a rapist.

3091
02:21:03,681 --> 02:21:07,490
Motherfucker will fuck that cat members,
so fucking ridiculous.

3092
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:08,533
It was just trying to kill that cat.
Always imagine if you went outside a 

3093
02:21:11,761 --> 02:21:12,594
skunk was trying to fuck your cat,
like your favorite cat and some wild 

3094
02:21:15,921 --> 02:21:19,090
skunk.
Just all sweet cathy.

3095
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:23,450
Pet behind her ears and you love her is 
dirty skunk.

3096
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:25,870
This fucking chicken.
Eat and monsters conceIt.

3097
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:26,713
Chickens.
By the way,

3098
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:27,593
here they break into chicken coop,
so I caught one trying to get into my 

3099
02:21:29,631 --> 02:21:30,640
chicken coop.
Carnivorous.

3100
02:21:31,390 --> 02:21:34,130
There are 100 percent predator skunks 
are predators.

3101
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:35,060
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

3102
02:21:35,061 --> 02:21:37,310
we think of them as the ground nesting 
birds.

3103
02:21:37,311 --> 02:21:38,510
Rats,
rodents,

3104
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:40,100
chickens.
The fuck up your chicken.

3105
02:21:40,190 --> 02:21:41,510
I'll get in.
He couldn't get in.

3106
02:21:41,511 --> 02:21:43,880
We chased them off though.
He stunk up my whole fucking yard.

3107
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:45,590
Yeah,
we know how to show.

3108
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:48,080
Showed me the deer eating the birds that
were stuck in the fence.

3109
02:21:48,081 --> 02:21:48,920
yeah,
the birds.

3110
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:49,813
Isn't it weird that you could be driving
on the god damn freeway with your 

3111
02:21:52,521 --> 02:21:57,260
windows rolled up eric tight and pass 
through a cloud of skunk smell?

3112
02:21:57,320 --> 02:21:58,153
How does it do the gods?
I'll tell you exactly how the same way 

3113
02:22:02,990 --> 02:22:07,730
the with the skunk smells so strong that
your reaction to it is like a bloodhound

3114
02:22:07,731 --> 02:22:10,450
reaction to persons sent like 
electricity when you.

3115
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,533
That's how we can understand like how 
bloodhound works and probably 

3116
02:22:13,490 --> 02:22:15,050
bloodhounds probably even better than 
that,

3117
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:16,820
but parts per million.

3118
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:17,653
Whether or not you can detect it.
Skunk smells so bad that in parts per 

3119
02:22:20,991 --> 02:22:21,824
million they can shoot it in the 
backyard and you could smell it like 

3120
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:25,320
literally a mile away.
Wow.

3121
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:27,220
Well that's how a dog works.
Yeah,

3122
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:31,080
like a good bloodhound.
They'll fucking smell you a mile away.

3123
02:22:31,081 --> 02:22:33,360
They just got to figure out where it's 
coming from.

3124
02:22:33,361 --> 02:22:34,710
They'll run that way.
Nope.

3125
02:22:34,711 --> 02:22:37,300
It's getting weaker.
they'll go run that way stronger.

3126
02:22:37,330 --> 02:22:38,710
I think it's electro.
It's a smell.

3127
02:22:38,810 --> 02:22:41,610
It smell.
It's hard to go through the glass.

3128
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:43,350
So jetson.
Well,

3129
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:44,193
how do you breed that?
He would run out of air if that thing 

3130
02:22:45,691 --> 02:22:46,524
was airtight.
Do you understand that you're coming 

3131
02:22:47,661 --> 02:22:49,820
into your filter's not airtight?
Well,

3132
02:22:49,821 --> 02:22:51,500
how come you don't feel it when you're 
driving?

3133
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:54,780
Because it goes through a whole system 
that's inside your dash breach?

3134
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:55,211
No,
no,

3135
02:22:55,211 --> 02:22:56,310
no,
it gets backed up,

3136
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,620
it gets backed up and then it comes 
through filters.

3137
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:00,810
Like you can open the filters to the 
vents,

3138
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:01,644
come through and then you can actually 
feel the breeze blow on you when you're 

3139
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:05,580
on the highway where you can close that 
shit.

3140
02:23:05,581 --> 02:23:08,070
But air still gets in.
He gets into the cabinet.

3141
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:09,960
I'm saying,
I'm going to guess that it's electrical.

3142
02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:12,263
Well,
you should definitely guess driving a 

3143
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:17,870
flintstone.
Coach burns by my online.

3144
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:21,230
We have libraries.
She'd go online with your phone.

3145
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:24,960
Just stay off youtube.
You're that your slave.

3146
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,630
Stay off flat earth.
Sixty nine.

3147
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:27,533
Youtube made by slave labor.
I'm not going to throw this away to 

3148
02:23:32,131 --> 02:23:32,964
prove that.
I don't believe in slate made these 

3149
02:23:36,031 --> 02:23:36,864
phones.
What was the name of that company that 

3150
02:23:37,801 --> 02:23:38,870
made like,
um,

3151
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:43,650
phones that were sustainably resourced 
and what was the company called?

3152
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:46,100
It was like ethical phones.
They like,

3153
02:23:46,230 --> 02:23:49,610
they tried to make some green phone or 
it's okay man,

3154
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:53,100
this guy makes 50 bucks an hour and 
everybody's happy.

3155
02:23:53,430 --> 02:23:54,300
Well,
isn't that a family?

3156
02:23:54,301 --> 02:23:55,980
Is they work three days a week?
They said anyway,

3157
02:23:56,050 --> 02:23:59,460
isn't that isn't the material used?
Isn't that mined in the Congo?

3158
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,920
The sticks?
Yes.

3159
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,290
LittlE kids with sticks have to pull it 
out of the rocks.

3160
02:24:03,630 --> 02:24:05,880
It's called tran.
I got to talk to my mom.

3161
02:24:05,910 --> 02:24:07,440
They get it in a couple of different 
places,

3162
02:24:07,490 --> 02:24:08,323
I guess where else to get it?
Afghanistan and they found trillions of 

3163
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:14,400
dollars worth of minerals in 
Afghanistan.

3164
02:24:14,401 --> 02:24:15,630
Hey guys,
we just.

3165
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:17,820
I can't believe this is here.
Amazing.

3166
02:24:17,821 --> 02:24:20,850
It's like they.
It's like they had a like a whole x on a

3167
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:24,870
fucking map the russians were doing.
We were digging.

3168
02:24:24,871 --> 02:24:26,160
Then finally they,
hey guys,

3169
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:27,850
can't even believe this,
but guess what?

3170
02:24:27,851 --> 02:24:30,390
There's like trillions of dollars worth 
of minerals here.

3171
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:32,603
I bet they're just saying that they're 
just there for the opium and they're 

3172
02:24:34,111 --> 02:24:34,471
like,
no,

3173
02:24:34,471 --> 02:24:35,670
no,
there's minerals here.

3174
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,450
Unless we struck minerals.
See,

3175
02:24:38,451 --> 02:24:40,140
this is where there's a flaw in your 
thinking.

3176
02:24:40,141 --> 02:24:41,520
They're going to take both of those 
things.

3177
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:43,800
They want it.
They want both of those things.

3178
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:44,713
The mother opium for fucking sure.
Sturgill simpson played a song on 

3179
02:24:49,441 --> 02:24:52,020
saturday night live about the opium 
trade,

3180
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:53,073
like they let them get away with it,
but talking about how Afghanistan as 

3181
02:24:55,860 --> 02:25:00,860
like a front front run by production,
it's also a country music star,

3182
02:25:00,961 --> 02:25:01,820
so they're like,
oh,

3183
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:04,360
that's all good.
You killed it on the ground.

3184
02:25:04,410 --> 02:25:06,120
A lot of poppies,
bad motherfucker,

3185
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:08,910
dude.
Say grow 96 percent of the world's opium

3186
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:11,350
that we were over there.
Yeah,

3187
02:25:11,550 --> 02:25:14,740
for sure.
Just for like freedom freedom.

3188
02:25:15,330 --> 02:25:17,910
We don't care about opium or even 
minerals.

3189
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:20,160
Those minerals here.
Wow.

3190
02:25:20,161 --> 02:25:22,760
Amazing.
We pulled out,

3191
02:25:22,761 --> 02:25:24,070
but we're going to leave behind a 
vacuum.

3192
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:28,750
Big ass it to a battleship.
We're going to fill that motherfucker up

3193
02:25:28,751 --> 02:25:31,820
with every six months.
Scroll heroin in the United States.

3194
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:33,250
Greenhouses.
No.

3195
02:25:35,890 --> 02:25:36,970
Hold on.
What is that jamie?

3196
02:25:36,971 --> 02:25:39,950
Would you pull up extra cost to make 
google phone in the us?

3197
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:42,070
Only four bucks.
Holy shit.

3198
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:46,840
That's not the iphone.
The iphone would cost to a moto x.

3199
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:48,370
Oh,
years ago in the bathroom.

3200
02:25:48,480 --> 02:25:51,270
Okay,
well that's four bucks.

3201
02:25:51,271 --> 02:25:53,560
More on the biggest cost that says is 
that there's a.

3202
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:56,410
In China,
they have at least maybe in one plant.

3203
02:25:56,590 --> 02:25:57,423
They're up to 30,000
industrial engineers to help the 

3204
02:25:59,321 --> 02:26:00,570
workers.
if something goes wrong,

3205
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:06,900
they're saving mad cash and they also 
know what the fuck they're doing.

3206
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:08,884
They've been doing it for a long time.
if you started that up in the United 

3207
02:26:11,410 --> 02:26:12,243
States,
like there'd be a lot of trial and 

3208
02:26:12,461 --> 02:26:14,170
error.
You'd have to be willing to throw away a

3209
02:26:14,171 --> 02:26:16,460
lot of money.
The phones would be shit.

3210
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:19,060
Come on now.
Think about it.

3211
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,220
Feel like an american car in the 
eighties.

3212
02:26:22,230 --> 02:26:25,540
The iphone in America first to build it 
now costs $2,000.

3213
02:26:26,210 --> 02:26:27,043
You're right,
but what does the cross now it costs a 

3214
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:29,910
thousand,
right?

3215
02:26:29,910 --> 02:26:30,400
Well,
no.

3216
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:33,640
Now the phone's like $700.
That's the comparison that.

3217
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:36,690
What is an iphone seven s?
What does that crossed?

3218
02:26:37,010 --> 02:26:41,260
They haven't made that seven plus rather
sorry.

3219
02:26:41,450 --> 02:26:43,450
The next one.
Are they going to ever bring that back?

3220
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:49,040
But you can get an adapter or use 
adapters.

3221
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:50,363
You know you get a lightning adapter,
sticks it in as a regular hole in the 

3222
02:26:52,361 --> 02:26:55,140
bottom of it.
I heard that the iphone eight,

3223
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:58,570
there's supposed to be flipped capable 
of bring about the flip flip.

3224
02:26:58,670 --> 02:27:02,260
That's going to make it a book no plugs 
to.

3225
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:04,870
It's all wireless charging,
which is maybe or maybe not true,

3226
02:27:04,871 --> 02:27:05,704
right?
It's going to be terrible with 

3227
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:07,840
electricity is going to be in the air.
We're all going to die.

3228
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:11,470
That's when tesla was talking about 
putting electricity in the air.

3229
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,130
You create habitat out there like radio.
You're gonna generate things.

3230
02:27:15,131 --> 02:27:15,964
We're going to be walking around with 
like tesla coils bouncing off of that 

3231
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:20,613
could have been real if they already 
aren't we already walking through a sea 

3232
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:24,713
of electricity.
There's definitely a lot of electricity 

3233
02:27:28,421 --> 02:27:31,270
around us and there's definitely wifi in
this room.

3234
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:34,720
We might be in the ocean of electro 
magnetism,

3235
02:27:34,721 --> 02:27:35,230
right?
Yeah,

3236
02:27:35,230 --> 02:27:36,820
bro.
Think about that.

3237
02:27:37,710 --> 02:27:41,080
What's powering your muscles?
Your muscles are pounding.

3238
02:27:41,090 --> 02:27:45,120
You lucked into some electrical outlet.
Well,

3239
02:27:45,121 --> 02:27:47,500
you know what it is.
Electricity is definitely a part of us.

3240
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:50,400
There's a lot of shit going on.
There's water that's important.

3241
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:52,780
Electricity that conducts through the 
water.

3242
02:27:52,781 --> 02:27:55,960
There's all the vitamins.
Jeff city in us,

3243
02:27:57,560 --> 02:27:59,490
jesus,
jesus,

3244
02:27:59,510 --> 02:28:00,343
jc,
but the love of running on wireless 

3245
02:28:04,391 --> 02:28:05,460
electricity.
Sure.

3246
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:08,860
We're watching like a bunch of cricket 
phones.

3247
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:09,753
What do you do?
You think that wifi and cell phone 

3248
02:28:12,401 --> 02:28:15,400
signals and all the signals that are 
around us all the time,

3249
02:28:15,401 --> 02:28:19,360
they just didn't exist when people were 
first created by hippie.

3250
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:21,040
Good lord.
How bad is it?

3251
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:22,970
No one's.
We're not dying.

3252
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:24,703
We have no idea.
Because remember the bluetooth they'd 

3253
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:28,100
put to your ear like,
I probably shouldn't do that.

3254
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:29,253
Or didn't they find that cell phones 
were bad sleep next to and put it next 

3255
02:28:31,731 --> 02:28:32,481
to your ear?
Yeah.

3256
02:28:32,481 --> 02:28:34,130
People say that it fucks with your 
karma.

3257
02:28:34,690 --> 02:28:36,720
She one of them.
One of them things.

3258
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:37,633
Well,
what happened to brain tumors the day 

3259
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:41,900
they let that go?
Is that real?

3260
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:43,190
But hidden.
What's her name?

3261
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:45,050
The fucking singer.
Didn't she have?

3262
02:28:45,051 --> 02:28:46,970
Um.
All I want to do,

3263
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:48,053
he just has that sheryl crow.
Didn't sheryl crow say that she got a 

3264
02:28:50,451 --> 02:28:54,860
brain tumor from doing press on a cell 
phone and the nineties she thinks that.

3265
02:28:54,861 --> 02:28:55,694
So gave it to her because it's on the 
same side of her head kind of fucking 

3266
02:28:57,441 --> 02:28:58,790
press tour where you.
It's crazy.

3267
02:28:58,790 --> 02:29:01,970
I talked to him.
I talked to a dude who had cancer of his

3268
02:29:01,971 --> 02:29:02,804
bone and his hip.
And it was right where he kept a cell 

3269
02:29:05,271 --> 02:29:06,104
phone and the doctor said that there's 
reoccurring instances that he's dealing 

3270
02:29:09,261 --> 02:29:12,770
with with people had cell phones.
Scotty get a bone graft,

3271
02:29:12,771 --> 02:29:15,130
bro,
get a cut of counselors side.

3272
02:29:15,470 --> 02:29:16,303
They had a cancerous chunk of his bone 
off and then they had to put a bone 

3273
02:29:19,101 --> 02:29:21,920
graft from somewhere else in there and 
fill it back in place.

3274
02:29:22,550 --> 02:29:23,383
And he was saying that this doctor was 
telling them that all these guys that 

3275
02:29:25,671 --> 02:29:27,980
come in and they have those hip things 
for cell phones,

3276
02:29:28,180 --> 02:29:30,860
like that's the side where they would 
get cancer.

3277
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:34,130
Most girls usually put the phone in 
their back pocket.

3278
02:29:34,131 --> 02:29:36,510
You're going to see a lot of asks cancer
tumors.

3279
02:29:37,130 --> 02:29:40,050
Tumors could be.
I wonder if we get some dick,

3280
02:29:41,550 --> 02:29:43,760
but when your fingers get the most 
tumors,

3281
02:29:44,330 --> 02:29:45,350
where's the hand cancer?

3282
02:29:45,530 --> 02:29:46,363
My hands feel good.
It just doesn't seem to be bothering 

3283
02:29:49,341 --> 02:29:50,930
anybody else.
Let's get enhanced cancer.

3284
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:52,870
You know,
maybe just got a weak hip bone.

3285
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:54,590
You fucking pussy.
You maybe need to walk it off.

3286
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:57,370
Yeah.
Maybe it's just incidents as shit.

3287
02:29:57,900 --> 02:30:00,080
Goddamn cell phone to your hip.
Like a psycho.

3288
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:02,180
But did you see sheryl crow?
Did you find that article?

3289
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:06,110
She actually had cancer and she didn't 
want to get the tumor removed.

3290
02:30:06,330 --> 02:30:07,163
Whoa.
But she got an inner dome on the same 

3291
02:30:08,931 --> 02:30:09,764
side is where a cell phone was and 
that's why she thought that it was from 

3292
02:30:12,410 --> 02:30:15,180
doing press.
She get to go hippo face.

3293
02:30:15,370 --> 02:30:17,900
How dare you?
Back when there was no internet,

3294
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:20,780
you know.
And you had to do press for radio or for

3295
02:30:20,781 --> 02:30:21,614
radio.
And you had to do press for an album 

3296
02:30:23,211 --> 02:30:24,020
that was coming out.
Yeah.

3297
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:25,690
You just call people up and do 
interviews.

3298
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:27,470
That's what they.
That's what you did.

3299
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:28,613
Leave this sheryl crow.
My brain tumor maybe related to cell 

3300
02:30:30,591 --> 02:30:31,424
phone use.
See the chosen fucked up picture or 

3301
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:34,813
tuition.
What's been trumped that doug just 

3302
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:41,800
fucking spray or no doctors that will 
confirm that crow said monday.

3303
02:30:42,561 --> 02:30:43,394
Well appealing on the premier of katie.
The new syndicated talk show hosted 

3304
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:49,400
hosted by katie couric.
Hilarious.

3305
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:50,413
I do have a theory that it's possible 
that it's related to that she spent 

3306
02:30:54,020 --> 02:30:56,630
hours on the old archaic cell phones.
Well,

3307
02:30:56,690 --> 02:30:57,523
she's probably right.
There's no doctors that will even 

3308
02:30:59,170 --> 02:31:04,170
confirmed it's part of a brain where she
often held her phone.

3309
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:06,480
Have you ever noticed,
have you ever been.

3310
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:10,710
Let's talk you up to something else,
but it might be true be,

3311
02:31:11,690 --> 02:31:13,400
but it could be that that's what 
happened.

3312
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:14,263
That's totally possible that she had 
that phone up to her head and broader 

3313
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:19,840
brand stretch.
More about what your.

3314
02:31:22,290 --> 02:31:25,770
Maybe there's a couple of days maybe 
there a cover to cover and there's a lot

3315
02:31:25,771 --> 02:31:27,780
of people are trying to test it on.
Here's.

3316
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:28,510
Yeah,
here's the other.

3317
02:31:28,510 --> 02:31:29,910
No,
I'm just guessing,

3318
02:31:29,911 --> 02:31:31,290
but radiation.
The doctor.

3319
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:33,210
We're to just talk over them.
Are you gonna?

3320
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:34,280
Let them talk.
I'm listening to him,

3321
02:31:34,281 --> 02:31:35,670
but he's gay.
He's getting me thinking about something

3322
02:31:35,671 --> 02:31:38,060
because he's got them out here.
You go like a cover up.

3323
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:39,990
Jesus christ.
He was in the middle of the talk.

3324
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:42,470
I would just force over.
I'm just bullshitting.

3325
02:31:42,620 --> 02:31:43,680
Well,
you might be right.

3326
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:44,543
Maybe the grappler on.
I just want to know what happened to 

3327
02:31:48,241 --> 02:31:49,950
that.
I mean you would think it is.

3328
02:31:49,951 --> 02:31:52,290
I would believe that it is dangerous.
I don't know,

3329
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:54,180
but maybe it's not.
I hope it's not,

3330
02:31:54,470 --> 02:31:55,430
oh,
that's all bullshit.

3331
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,030
But I mean,
does anybody fucking.

3332
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,030
No where they haven't been around that 
long.

3333
02:32:00,850 --> 02:32:02,760
Like how long have people been using 
cell phones?

3334
02:32:02,761 --> 02:32:05,310
The way we're using them now where 
you're constantly on them.

3335
02:32:05,311 --> 02:32:08,620
Twenty years.
Has it been eight years now?

3336
02:32:08,630 --> 02:32:13,020
I remember yet.
Twenty minutes.

3337
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:17,460
Smartphones,
smartphones were the thing that did it.

3338
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:18,400
Was it o seven?
Zero.

3339
02:32:18,401 --> 02:32:19,234
Eight?
Yes.

3340
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:20,183
So from then on people are like slowly 
but surely getting more and more 

3341
02:32:23,521 --> 02:32:24,354
integrated into using that electronic 
device and constantly being either 

3342
02:32:26,731 --> 02:32:27,564
because before that there was no twitter
or facebook or instagram or any of that 

3343
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:31,840
shit.
Yeah,

3344
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:33,990
there was no like answering questions on
google.

3345
02:32:33,991 --> 02:32:37,560
So you and also you get taxed and send 
calls forever.

3346
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:38,513
Right.
There was no internet until 2007 and 

3347
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:45,000
nobody was going online with a trio 
piece of shit.

3348
02:32:47,221 --> 02:32:47,730
I'm like,
yeah,

3349
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:48,563
it was falling.
That's why black pain was so important 

3350
02:32:51,661 --> 02:32:55,560
because the email,
no one was on the phone a ton.

3351
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:56,433
Texts actually people have had their 
phones at their heads for longer since 

3352
02:32:59,581 --> 02:33:03,350
like what?
Since probably 92.

3353
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:08,340
No,
sheryl crow became popular in 94.

3354
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:09,533
I remember that because I had just come 
to la and all I want to do is have some 

3355
02:33:12,361 --> 02:33:14,490
fun.
Was like on the radio back then it was a

3356
02:33:14,491 --> 02:33:15,324
big jam so those phones were just.
They might as well been plutonium and a 

3357
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:21,450
fucking a lot of gold cup where they're 
like this.

3358
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:25,170
He held those pitches ahead,
but actually I read this thing about how

3359
02:33:25,171 --> 02:33:28,020
when radiation,
like from a phone or whatever,

3360
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:33,230
I guess the idea is that it can break 
apart certain like mitochondria or d dna

3361
02:33:36,931 --> 02:33:37,681
strand.
What is it,

3362
02:33:37,681 --> 02:33:39,450
where it sounds like some bullshit it'll
take.

3363
02:33:39,810 --> 02:33:42,380
It disrupts certain from the library,
bro.

3364
02:33:42,390 --> 02:33:45,360
I can't remember.
It disrupts things in that process.

3365
02:33:45,361 --> 02:33:46,194
Can actually cause sometimes cancer.
So it's pretty hard to kind of draw a 

3366
02:33:51,451 --> 02:33:53,500
through line because there's so many 
different calls to.

3367
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:54,333
So there's the reality that what causes 
cancer to use not going to cause cancer 

3368
02:33:57,481 --> 02:33:59,310
to him.
I'm not going to cause cancer to another

3369
02:33:59,311 --> 02:34:00,144
person and my would make you sick.
Everybody's in their own weird 

3370
02:34:03,061 --> 02:34:04,440
biological makeup.
Oh yeah.

3371
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:05,503
Some people are super susceptible to all
sorts of weird diseases that other 

3372
02:34:07,741 --> 02:34:08,574
people aren't,
and there's also environmental factors 

3373
02:34:09,781 --> 02:34:12,150
like maybe what you work is kind of 
fucked up too,

3374
02:34:12,290 --> 02:34:14,490
but maybe working in a gas station or 
something like that,

3375
02:34:14,491 --> 02:34:15,324
or you doing the auto repair and you're 
fucking breathe it in paint fumes and 

3376
02:34:17,831 --> 02:34:18,664
shit,
and then on top of that you're dealing 

3377
02:34:19,991 --> 02:34:20,750
with that,
right?

3378
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:23,740
That that could just be.
It'd be a combination of factors.

3379
02:34:23,741 --> 02:34:25,780
It kills your immune system factors 
here,

3380
02:34:26,210 --> 02:34:27,043
it's like when you smoke cigarettes,
not everybody who smokes even a lot for 

3381
02:34:29,801 --> 02:34:32,140
a lifetime gets lung cancer.
some people just don't.

3382
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:34,320
They live into their nineties,
smoke considered crazy,

3383
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:35,583
but then there's also the reality of 
living anywhere in high population 

3384
02:34:37,931 --> 02:34:39,790
centers.
You're being poisoned.

3385
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:43,210
Everybody around us is being poisoned,
if not a whole lot to fuck.

3386
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:44,680
Yes,
100 percent.

3387
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:45,833
You come over that hill and you look 
down into the valley and everything is 

3388
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:49,233
brown as fuck.
You are breathing that you are 100 

3389
02:34:53,591 --> 02:34:56,950
percent breathe in your household.
You see it when you get down,

3390
02:34:56,951 --> 02:34:59,920
but you know how I can tell because 
there's a place near,

3391
02:34:59,921 --> 02:35:00,754
um,
like there's a place where you drive 

3392
02:35:02,471 --> 02:35:07,471
over between like topanga and like to 
soda,

3393
02:35:08,081 --> 02:35:08,914
like that area wHere you could like look
over and you could see tHe mountains 

3394
02:35:12,181 --> 02:35:14,980
sometimes,
like maybe like when neck coming down to

3395
02:35:14,981 --> 02:35:15,700
one [inaudible],
one,

3396
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:16,533
you can see the mountains sometimes and 
sometimes you don't see the mouse 

3397
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,120
defrays the fucking shit hides 
mountains,

3398
02:35:22,290 --> 02:35:23,123
the snow covered mountains that you 
could get lost on and die in and you 

3399
02:35:28,241 --> 02:35:29,630
don't see it all.

3400
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:33,370
You see brown,
that's digital breathing that.

3401
02:35:33,430 --> 02:35:36,150
That's right.
It's been like that forever.

3402
02:35:36,151 --> 02:35:38,680
And la,
it's the valley.

3403
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:41,590
It's a whole mixture to but it's way 
worse.

3404
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:42,483
It's way worse now than it was like back
when people are on horses and shit been 

3405
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:51,230
told me in front of our producer guy,
he said that uh,

3406
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:56,200
before people even settled in southern 
California,

3407
02:35:56,201 --> 02:36:00,760
the indians called southern California 
that landed the smoke smoke or something

3408
02:36:00,761 --> 02:36:01,594
like that.
Right.

3409
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:02,870
So,
and you see,

3410
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:06,580
I've noticed this since I was a kid.
Sometimes you can't see the mountains.

3411
02:36:06,581 --> 02:36:10,780
There's too much smog and then a storm 
happens and then evidence clear and then

3412
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:13,610
it just a cycle it.
I thought that that was.

3413
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:16,840
We were going to come to a day where it 
would never clear up.

3414
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:21,870
It would just be so bad after 20 years,
but it's actually way better.

3415
02:36:22,330 --> 02:36:23,163
The air quality in los angeles is way 
better because cars are way better at 

3416
02:36:25,441 --> 02:36:29,260
cars are cleaner,
so eventually the wind just.

3417
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:30,720
We'll clean it.
Here's,

3418
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:33,390
here's something real crazy flip 
population.

3419
02:36:33,450 --> 02:36:34,283
A porsche nine slash 11 turbo.
The air that comes out is cleaner than 

3420
02:36:36,701 --> 02:36:38,290
the air that goes in.
If you drive it in la.

3421
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:39,593
Wow.
What's really a porsche nine slash 11 

3422
02:36:42,341 --> 02:36:43,180
turbo.
It's carbon.

3423
02:36:43,181 --> 02:36:44,014
It's carbon emissions are so low that 
the air that it takes in until those 

3424
02:36:46,901 --> 02:36:47,734
turbo charges goes through the 
combustion engine and comes out the 

3425
02:36:49,361 --> 02:36:52,390
exhaust is actually cleaner than the air
it's taking in.

3426
02:36:52,510 --> 02:36:55,170
How about this crazy statistic?
The average carter,

3427
02:36:55,390 --> 02:36:56,223
the average car on the seventies,
it made it more pollution sitting 

3428
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:00,513
without its engine on in a driveway 
because of fuel of operation than the 

3429
02:37:04,031 --> 02:37:06,520
average car on the highway today in los 
angeles.

3430
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:07,713
That's brand new.

3431
02:37:07,850 --> 02:37:10,180
You remember we used to hear the gas 
slosh around back there.

3432
02:37:10,181 --> 02:37:11,860
Yeah,
like if you had a car,

3433
02:37:11,861 --> 02:37:13,450
like an old car and you like took a 
turn.

3434
02:37:13,451 --> 02:37:14,284
He went a little sideways here.
The gas slosh around fucking shitty car 

3435
02:37:18,830 --> 02:37:22,490
carburetors before we had catalytic 
converters smelled it inside the car.

3436
02:37:22,491 --> 02:37:24,590
He had a roll the windows down.
When you're on the highway,

3437
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:25,881
it's not bad,
right?

3438
02:37:25,881 --> 02:37:28,860
so magic markers a dig.
That stuff shouldn't be.

3439
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:29,713
They'll smell a sharp.
So anybody that's worried about being 

3440
02:37:31,191 --> 02:37:32,024
poisoned,
you definitely be employed and we're 

3441
02:37:33,051 --> 02:37:36,680
breathing in brake dust 100 percent.
It's not good for you and it's gonna.

3442
02:37:36,950 --> 02:37:40,280
It's gonna shorten your life and might 
only short your life by a few years.

3443
02:37:40,281 --> 02:37:42,650
It might make the last few years of your
life more uncomfortable,

3444
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:45,230
but if you go somewhere where this is 
not the case,

3445
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:47,900
you go to like fucking deer valley,
Utah.

3446
02:37:48,090 --> 02:37:50,960
You go hang out up there and look out 
over the mountains.

3447
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:56,020
I'd rather there than live there and my 
parents just kill me.

3448
02:37:56,901 --> 02:38:00,380
Threatened parents.
That's why I brought it up.

3449
02:38:00,410 --> 02:38:01,830
You fucking awesome.
Other.

3450
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:03,440
They love it.
It's beautiful,

3451
02:38:03,650 --> 02:38:05,090
man.
It's cool to visit.

3452
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:06,013
No,
the problem is we got to get more cool 

3453
02:38:06,901 --> 02:38:08,710
people to live up in a place like that.
That's right.

3454
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:10,850
That's what you gotta do.
Like we're in the wrong spot.

3455
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,770
Like the people that we know are all 
awesome,

3456
02:38:12,771 --> 02:38:13,604
but we're definitely in the wrong spot.
The only thing that's good about this 

3457
02:38:15,651 --> 02:38:19,340
spot is it warm is no bugs,
but the real problem is it's warm.

3458
02:38:19,341 --> 02:38:20,174
There's no bugs.
Like one of the reasons why the indians 

3459
02:38:23,331 --> 02:38:26,240
call this valley to smoke is like fire 
is fucking normal for here.

3460
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:29,660
Things are supposed to burn down and 
then they build back better.

3461
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,640
I mean,
this is like,

3462
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:31,473
it clears out entire forest,
like controlled burns is something that 

3463
02:38:35,901 --> 02:38:39,650
forest service is due because you have 
to burn down a certain amount of the old

3464
02:38:39,651 --> 02:38:40,484
shit.
Otherwise it just becomes kindling and 

3465
02:38:41,811 --> 02:38:42,644
then when the fires do come,
they're unmanageable and then on top of 

3466
02:38:45,021 --> 02:38:45,854
that,
the carbon needs to fucking be 

3467
02:38:46,401 --> 02:38:49,700
recirculated into the earth.
Like it's a good thing.

3468
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:50,773
These burns and that was.
That happened for millions of years and 

3469
02:38:53,181 --> 02:38:54,014
now because there's no burn,
it's like it changes the environment 

3470
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:56,893
like this place.
Places that the used to have burns and 

3471
02:38:58,251 --> 02:38:59,084
now they control them.
Something like the force goes away and 

3472
02:39:01,041 --> 02:39:01,874
then just go with these big dry ass 
grassy shitty areas over hundreds of 

3473
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,490
years of doing this.
It's,

3474
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:10,010
it's so weird,
man.

3475
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:11,143
It's like the way people live.
We think that we could just stay in one 

3476
02:39:14,361 --> 02:39:16,040
spot and this spot is going to be fine.

3477
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:19,790
That's never been the case anywhere on 
earth switches supposed to move.

3478
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:23,330
We're supposed to be nomadic.
You have to move back to find out,

3479
02:39:23,350 --> 02:39:25,490
dude,
you can't stay right next to the ocean.

3480
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:28,130
That fucking that malibu coast is a 
joke.

3481
02:39:28,710 --> 02:39:31,300
Those people with the fucking.
Oh man pose.

3482
02:39:31,370 --> 02:39:32,203
This is my spot.
Bet you're on the edge of the great 

3483
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:37,970
water next to you.
He said,

3484
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,720
giant monster of water.
It's miles deep.

3485
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:45,880
Three quarters of the surface of the 
earth and your life on the edge.

3486
02:39:45,881 --> 02:39:47,330
His mind get off.
Don't you?

3487
02:39:47,331 --> 02:39:48,164
Frisbee in front of my hedge.
We like pick a spot like some crazy 

3488
02:39:51,591 --> 02:39:52,424
stupid crap.
It's like locked itself on a reef and 

3489
02:39:54,741 --> 02:39:57,470
it's claiming to revise its own.
That's what we're like.

3490
02:39:57,471 --> 02:39:59,870
We're like standing by the ocean with 
your $20,000,000

3491
02:39:59,871 --> 02:40:02,720
house in malibu.
Kicking surfers off your front,

3492
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:07,940
but you're by the great water the fuck 
out.

3493
02:40:08,050 --> 02:40:08,883
Go to the hills at any time.
That could be an earthquake and the big 

3494
02:40:11,601 --> 02:40:14,460
Wave way to Arizona

3495
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:17,640
to come over the malibu and checked in 
the houses out.

3496
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:19,700
fuck yeah.
I lived there for awhile.

3497
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:21,580
You didn't like dude?
No,

3498
02:40:21,581 --> 02:40:21,851
no,
no,

3499
02:40:21,851 --> 02:40:22,440
no,
no.

3500
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:23,273
My daughter broke her arm at school and 
we couldn't stay at this place because 

3501
02:40:26,401 --> 02:40:27,234
it had staircases that were really steep
and there was one that went down to the 

3502
02:40:30,361 --> 02:40:31,194
ocean.
It was one of them electric stairs and 

3503
02:40:32,221 --> 02:40:34,900
it was broken and so it only went like 
this.

3504
02:40:34,901 --> 02:40:36,720
So you've got a climate like a fucking 
ladder.

3505
02:40:36,721 --> 02:40:37,554
It was sketcHy as fuck to get down to 
the ocean and it just was too dangerous 

3506
02:40:41,161 --> 02:40:42,230
where her arm was broken.
Yeah.

3507
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:44,210
You love malibu though.
I remember that.

3508
02:40:44,310 --> 02:40:48,090
I love the air.
I love the looking at the ocean,

3509
02:40:48,091 --> 02:40:48,924
but I don't want to live there.
I don't want to live next to the big 

3510
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:52,033
water ties because when you're at high,
this is what happened with me and the 

3511
02:40:54,811 --> 02:40:55,500
message.

3512
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:58,290
We've got high one night and went 
downstairs.

3513
02:40:58,291 --> 02:40:59,124
There's this downstairs to this house.
It's like literally the water's coming 

3514
02:41:01,231 --> 02:41:05,280
in right under carrie and we were 
sitting in,

3515
02:41:05,320 --> 02:41:07,990
me and her were like looking out the 
window and I and I looked on her,

3516
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:10,140
go,
fuck this place.

3517
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:12,510
Fuck this place.
No,

3518
02:41:12,511 --> 02:41:12,811
no,
no,

3519
02:41:12,811 --> 02:41:13,644
no.
You realize what it really is like when 

3520
02:41:15,631 --> 02:41:20,490
you're right there at night in a house 
overlooking the ocean.

3521
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:21,383
It's real nature reveals itself to you 
because you can be really complacent 

3522
02:41:26,281 --> 02:41:29,070
when you see everything.
See when it's light out,

3523
02:41:29,250 --> 02:41:31,590
you see everything,
you look up,

3524
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:34,320
the sun is shining,
the clouds are moving.

3525
02:41:34,321 --> 02:41:38,460
You see birds,
you look down at the ocean and you go,

3526
02:41:38,461 --> 02:41:39,840
wow,
this is so cool.

3527
02:41:39,841 --> 02:41:42,900
It's so calling being by the ocean,
but when you're at night,

3528
02:41:43,130 --> 02:41:46,230
it's black and there's nothing out.
Then you realize,

3529
02:41:46,260 --> 02:41:48,870
oh my god,
that's all water.

3530
02:41:49,250 --> 02:41:52,470
That's all water,
water to do it.

3531
02:41:52,471 --> 02:41:54,030
We stayed there and we rented it for 
three months.

3532
02:41:54,031 --> 02:41:55,050
I stayed there five times.

3533
02:41:58,030 --> 02:41:59,940
What part of it?
Because my daughter broke her arm,

3534
02:41:59,941 --> 02:42:01,500
but part of me was like,
oh god,

3535
02:42:01,501 --> 02:42:03,810
so high that I realized the nature of 
it.

3536
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:07,470
It is a big,
dark monster of water.

3537
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:10,980
They're totally unfeeling and teeming 
with life.

3538
02:42:11,010 --> 02:42:12,840
Oh yeah.
Most likely.

3539
02:42:12,870 --> 02:42:13,703
If you look at the habits of nature,
most likely when things become too 

3540
02:42:16,501 --> 02:42:17,334
dominant,
something comes along and tries to take 

3541
02:42:18,541 --> 02:42:19,374
them out.
When things take too much from one 

3542
02:42:20,941 --> 02:42:22,860
environment,
they wind up starving,

3543
02:42:22,861 --> 02:42:25,860
are going extinct.
This is like the constant cycle of life,

3544
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:27,320
right?
Fellows.

3545
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:28,673
Here we are standing next to this great 
wall of life that will been sucking out 

3546
02:42:35,070 --> 02:42:36,690
with nets,
kill it,

3547
02:42:36,691 --> 02:42:37,524
everything.
Imagine if you could go back 500 years 

3548
02:42:39,630 --> 02:42:40,463
and just look under the water and see 
what it looked like and then go back to 

3549
02:42:43,081 --> 02:42:45,400
today and look under the water and see 
all the fish are gone.

3550
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:49,680
How many fish there must've been 
created.

3551
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:51,143
She meant,
you know how clean it must've been 

3552
02:42:52,171 --> 02:42:53,004
everywhere before we were pumping our 
shit and when I was scuba diving into 

3553
02:42:57,790 --> 02:43:00,180
hedy by a couple months ago.
It is.

3554
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:04,530
You look out and all you see is fucking 
schools of fish.

3555
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:06,420
It's like finding the va.
There's no difference.

3556
02:43:06,421 --> 02:43:08,100
I swear to god.
You see sharks.

3557
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:10,350
I looked into the literature for sharks 
there.

3558
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:11,500
Lemon sharks don't.
Sounds cool.

3559
02:43:11,501 --> 02:43:12,310
I was always like,

3560
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:13,143
dude,
it's like tying in with life probably 

3561
02:43:15,150 --> 02:43:16,490
the whole ocean.
Yeah.

3562
02:43:16,491 --> 02:43:18,790
At one point in time,
coral when you touch the coral,

3563
02:43:18,791 --> 02:43:20,410
like there are things in the corner like
he,

3564
02:43:20,411 --> 02:43:24,190
he told me to just just put your fingers
and it was this big flower was beautiful

3565
02:43:24,191 --> 02:43:25,024
and it just disappeared.
It's like a magic thing that it's the 

3566
02:43:28,441 --> 02:43:29,274
most scuba diving.
I was down there for so long that I 

3567
02:43:31,271 --> 02:43:33,760
almost got nitrogen poisoning.
Really pleasant way to die actually.

3568
02:43:33,761 --> 02:43:35,160
You just go,
you just.

3569
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:36,123
People will take their regular out of,
give it to the fish so they can breathe 

3570
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:41,410
and die.
You guys super slim a bitch.

3571
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:45,330
But I was down there for two hours man.
And I'm telling you,

3572
02:43:45,350 --> 02:43:47,200
you know,
you never see when you scuba dive.

3573
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:48,400
What fish?
What do you think?

3574
02:43:48,401 --> 02:43:49,930
What?
What aniMal do you never see?

3575
02:43:51,740 --> 02:43:54,850
Chickens you never see.

3576
02:43:55,180 --> 02:43:56,470
Not at blue.
Well you can see whales.

3577
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:59,680
You never see dolphins because they 
don't like the bubbles.

3578
02:43:59,681 --> 02:44:00,990
And you will.
And I talked to dr.

3579
02:44:01,130 --> 02:44:03,820
Has been scuba diving for 40 years.
I said you ever seen dolphins?

3580
02:44:03,821 --> 02:44:06,130
He goes,
never now to smart.

3581
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:06,993
Why?
So they see the bubbles and that was 

3582
02:44:07,631 --> 02:44:09,190
probably like,
I just don't like it.

3583
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:10,053
It sounds like shit.
and then probably they probably don't 

3584
02:44:11,621 --> 02:44:13,310
like it that you could stay under.
No,

3585
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:15,990
don't go to the top and then get the 
fuck out of there.

3586
02:44:15,991 --> 02:44:16,750
Yeah,
I don't know.

3587
02:44:16,750 --> 02:44:19,780
It's very interesting day.
We saw a whole school of them as soon as

3588
02:44:19,781 --> 02:44:20,820
we got up in the water,
they were all.

3589
02:44:21,050 --> 02:44:21,883
Well yeah,
those are the little ones to the gray 

3590
02:44:22,721 --> 02:44:25,480
ones ever seen the malibu all.
Maybe they hunt them.

3591
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:27,730
Melbourne.
I'm sure some people do.

3592
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,230
They hunt them because they killed tuna.

3593
02:44:29,560 --> 02:44:31,150
That's one of the things that the 
japanese do.

3594
02:44:31,151 --> 02:44:31,984
They're not really eating them as much 
as they're killing them in order to 

3595
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:34,533
like.
Because they,

3596
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:36,070
they get it.
Like,

3597
02:44:36,071 --> 02:44:37,240
you know,
you've got hundreds of dolphins.

3598
02:44:37,241 --> 02:44:40,620
They find a school to another decimated.
So these tuna men,

3599
02:44:40,850 --> 02:44:44,200
you know that like they used to.
If you watched jiro dreams of sushi,

3600
02:44:44,201 --> 02:44:46,570
have you seen the doc on netflix?
Really interesting.

3601
02:44:46,571 --> 02:44:49,600
But one of the things that really struck
me was how he was talking about how when

3602
02:44:49,601 --> 02:44:50,434
he first became a sushi chef,
how easy it was to get the tuna and how 

3603
02:44:52,901 --> 02:44:55,540
much tuna there was and how it stuck 
radically diminished.

3604
02:44:55,850 --> 02:44:57,910
We got famous.
You silly bitch.

3605
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,040
We all weighed in.
Really?

3606
02:44:59,050 --> 02:44:59,883
His place is a tiny little ass place.
But I'm talking about from the time he 

3607
02:45:01,751 --> 02:45:02,584
was a young man.
Now he's like in the seventies or 

3608
02:45:04,661 --> 02:45:05,140
something like that.

3609
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,170
I think he might be dead actually.
No.

3610
02:45:07,450 --> 02:45:08,650
Yeah,
his son runs.

3611
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:09,910
Yeah.
He's no longer alive.

3612
02:45:09,911 --> 02:45:11,800
He died after the movie.
I think so.

3613
02:45:13,250 --> 02:45:14,083
I think he's dead.
I know his son was supposed to go next 

3614
02:45:16,361 --> 02:45:18,170
in line.
You could have that job.

3615
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,740
Miserable.
Yeah.

3616
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:21,990
Everybody's like,
fine.

3617
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:23,680
They find beauty in it.
And I understand.

3618
02:45:23,681 --> 02:45:24,970
I watched it.
I get it.

3619
02:45:25,010 --> 02:45:25,843
It's,
there is some sort of a beauty and the 

3620
02:45:26,861 --> 02:45:27,694
meticulous,
meticulous process of creating the 

3621
02:45:29,651 --> 02:45:31,300
perfect food.
Exhausting though.

3622
02:45:31,390 --> 02:45:32,690
Unbelievable.
Uh,

3623
02:45:32,710 --> 02:45:33,543
what's the name knit?
What's the fucking doesn't in general 

3624
02:45:35,400 --> 02:45:37,000
when you're me,
the sushi.

3625
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:38,520
Wait to watch you eat it.
Yeah.

3626
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:39,880
Freaky like,
get the fuck out my face,

3627
02:45:39,881 --> 02:45:41,110
man.
I just want to talk to my wife.

3628
02:45:41,150 --> 02:45:45,430
Yeah,
I want to do a six month waiting list to

3629
02:45:46,270 --> 02:45:46,930
that.
Um,

3630
02:45:46,930 --> 02:45:47,763
do you think that that's different 
though than eating at a restaurant or 

3631
02:45:49,590 --> 02:45:51,580
you go to a steakhouse,
the waiter comes,

3632
02:45:51,581 --> 02:45:53,860
everybody's pleasant.
It makes the experience better.

3633
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:55,150
You sit there,
you cut up your food,

3634
02:45:55,151 --> 02:45:55,984
you have a conversation.
But if you're sitting in front of that 

3635
02:45:57,401 --> 02:45:58,600
dude,
it's very different.

3636
02:45:58,630 --> 02:45:59,440
You gotta be like,
gee,

3637
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:01,690
this is a completely different sort of 
experience.

3638
02:46:01,950 --> 02:46:02,783
This guy is crafting some sort of 
culinary artwork for you in the form of 

3639
02:46:07,451 --> 02:46:10,220
these bite sized morsels of perfectly

3640
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:11,083
aged fish with a perfect sauce on it 
with a perfectly cooked rice and he's 

3641
02:46:15,111 --> 02:46:17,210
been meticulous about this process for 
so long.

3642
02:46:17,211 --> 02:46:18,044
Like you're,
you're taking in Some sort of a weird 

3643
02:46:18,921 --> 02:46:20,690
vibe.
I wouldn't want to do it all the time.

3644
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:23,300
No one wants once every 10 years be 
great.

3645
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:24,193
The other thing is you're going to walk 
away starving dogs a form of mastery 

3646
02:46:28,461 --> 02:46:29,760
that you should always experience 
[inaudible].

3647
02:46:29,780 --> 02:46:32,600
I think it's mastery and artist rates 
and fat sushi.

3648
02:46:32,601 --> 02:46:35,420
That's trends.
It transcends rice.

3649
02:46:35,480 --> 02:46:36,680
Fish,
rice.

3650
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:38,980
You see the documentary.
I know.

3651
02:46:39,250 --> 02:46:39,780
Yes.
I did.

3652
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:42,500
Nice fish.
That's like saying anything you can do,

3653
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:43,383
you can simplify it,
but don't you think that life is about 

3654
02:46:46,491 --> 02:46:47,324
the variety of choices that you have and
it's good that you could go to a place 

3655
02:46:49,881 --> 02:46:50,714
like this and have these weird bites of 
clam mixed with a weird sort of a 

3656
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:55,753
seaweed wrap on top of it and some 
perfectly cooked rice with a little bit 

3657
02:46:59,390 --> 02:47:02,550
of you listening to benihana.

3658
02:47:02,570 --> 02:47:05,200
right.
So ron is when the steakhouse,

3659
02:47:05,650 --> 02:47:06,990
they cook in front of,
you know,

3660
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:08,290
benihana.
They cook in front of that.

3661
02:47:08,330 --> 02:47:10,540
This would be like a sweet fish or 
sugar.

3662
02:47:11,130 --> 02:47:12,130
Sugar fish.
Yeah,

3663
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:15,110
but it's like a little art form.
It's different.

3664
02:47:15,470 --> 02:47:19,520
It's like I liked it that I liked that.
I liked classical music sometimes.

3665
02:47:19,521 --> 02:47:20,630
Man,
I liked it.

3666
02:47:20,631 --> 02:47:22,700
It exists,
but if I went to a Henry Rollins concert

3667
02:47:22,701 --> 02:47:25,220
or something like that and someone was 
playing classical music,

3668
02:47:25,221 --> 02:47:25,611
I'd be like,
well,

3669
02:47:25,611 --> 02:47:26,720
this doesn't work.
Yeah.

3670
02:47:26,750 --> 02:47:27,583
You go see metallica and there's a 
classical music band that opens up for 

3671
02:47:29,811 --> 02:47:30,171
them.
You're like,

3672
02:47:30,171 --> 02:47:31,040
well,
okay.

3673
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:32,690
Right.
Or the opposite.

3674
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:35,180
They have to go on after like slayer,
slayer,

3675
02:47:35,181 --> 02:47:36,320
and then classical music.
Yeah.

3676
02:47:36,390 --> 02:47:37,880
What doesn't mean the classical music 
sucks.

3677
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:39,680
It means it's like right now it's not 
the place for it.

3678
02:47:39,681 --> 02:47:40,830
It's not my frequency.
Right.

3679
02:47:42,180 --> 02:47:43,810
Want to fucking t bone.

3680
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:46,090
So sometimes you want a fat porterhouse,
you know,

3681
02:47:46,091 --> 02:47:46,924
you want mashed potatoes and gravy and 
sometimes you only want to sit down in 

3682
02:47:49,580 --> 02:47:50,413
front of this guy has been working his 
whole life on crafting the perfect kind 

3683
02:47:53,361 --> 02:47:54,260
of sushi.
Correct.

3684
02:47:54,261 --> 02:47:55,670
And he's going to judge you while you 
eat it.

3685
02:47:55,910 --> 02:47:58,880
Yeah.
This is going to serve you.

3686
02:47:59,030 --> 02:47:59,990
I love that.
Oh no.

3687
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:01,700
You have to eat.
You need a certain way yet.

3688
02:48:01,701 --> 02:48:03,940
And he wants your response and then 
delete.

3689
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:05,540
Yeah.
A certain way.

3690
02:48:05,541 --> 02:48:07,610
What's a certain way?
Like I'm not sure man.

3691
02:48:07,790 --> 02:48:11,000
Who walks the dog?
He just gives it to you and you eat it.

3692
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:11,811
no,
no.

3693
02:48:11,811 --> 02:48:15,160
So why did I,
w I was in Italy and I considered the,

3694
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:17,270
the one that won the number one 
restaurant in the world,

3695
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:18,740
you know,
like initially and gives the,

3696
02:48:18,980 --> 02:48:21,470
gives an award to the best restaurant 
once a year.

3697
02:48:21,470 --> 02:48:22,440
Right.
Woo.

3698
02:48:22,530 --> 02:48:27,530
And we actually sat with the chef and he
had like this,

3699
02:48:27,560 --> 02:48:28,393
like this thing comes out and it was a 
bond was like this bond with eel like 

3700
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:36,470
barbecued eel.
You'd be like,

3701
02:48:36,471 --> 02:48:37,790
usually like,
what the fuck is this?

3702
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:40,130
It was,
well when you,

3703
02:48:40,131 --> 02:48:42,800
when you bite into it,
you don't ever say,

3704
02:48:42,830 --> 02:48:45,350
oh that tastes just like,
you don't ever say that.

3705
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:47,630
Well you don't even say that.
Tastes kind of like you just go.

3706
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:50,420
Never smelled or tasted anything like 
that in my life.

3707
02:48:50,450 --> 02:48:53,720
That's the most unique fucking flavor 
and experience I've ever had.

3708
02:48:53,721 --> 02:48:54,554
And that's why he's always been in the 
top for the past five years has been in 

3709
02:48:57,010 --> 02:48:59,390
the top three best restaurants.
Finding sandwiches.

3710
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:02,630
He makes the craziest shit.
He'll make a grilled cheese,

3711
02:49:02,780 --> 02:49:04,010
he'll make a grilled cheese and it's 
like,

3712
02:49:04,011 --> 02:49:04,850
oh,
it's a grilled cheese.

3713
02:49:04,910 --> 02:49:05,541
Well,
no,

3714
02:49:05,541 --> 02:49:06,374
it's not actually,
it's what's called a perfect grilled 

3715
02:49:07,801 --> 02:49:08,130
cheese

3716
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:10,230
and then everything else is trying to be
a grilled cheese.

3717
02:49:10,231 --> 02:49:11,120
It's like,
that's.

3718
02:49:11,150 --> 02:49:12,810
That's good.
He'll do simple shit.

3719
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:16,110
Little simple things and change your 
whole fucking life.

3720
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:18,353
Some bitch.
Nobody's changed my life with a fucking 

3721
02:49:20,011 --> 02:49:23,820
grilled cheese sandwich was so ahead of 
himself.

3722
02:49:24,060 --> 02:49:25,770
I'm just telling you so when you get 
grilled.

3723
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:28,140
So it's a fucking grilled cheese 
sandwich.

3724
02:49:29,290 --> 02:49:32,940
Butter and jelly.
We had a sliding was a slider.

3725
02:49:33,130 --> 02:49:35,910
I had cheese sandwich once with short 
ribs,

3726
02:49:35,911 --> 02:49:37,340
barbecued beef,
short ribs in it.

3727
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:42,030
We should go eat.
Do those shorts that morton feldman with

3728
02:49:42,031 --> 02:49:43,800
Alex Jones.
Good lord.

3729
02:49:43,801 --> 02:49:47,370
They're good whole lee.
She's not as good as this guy.

3730
02:49:47,380 --> 02:49:49,830
You fuckers fox,
you don't know shit up.

3731
02:49:49,831 --> 02:49:51,480
This is why trump won.
People like you,

3732
02:49:51,780 --> 02:49:52,613
people like you and your fruity talking 
about god damn elco neaten it and slave 

3733
02:49:57,710 --> 02:50:01,050
served from Chad,
but it was cheap.

3734
02:50:01,660 --> 02:50:02,493
I mean,
any one of these,

3735
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:06,450
if they gave you an option to buy the 
phone in the United States,

3736
02:50:06,451 --> 02:50:11,070
but the phone might be a little more 
wonky and cost 500 bucks more,

3737
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:14,280
or you could just keep it going with 
slave labor,

3738
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:16,380
slave labor,
but I got to talk to my mother,

3739
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:18,810
talking about the slave phone says,
I'll take that.

3740
02:50:18,990 --> 02:50:19,823
You're going to take that.
That's the one that's made in this 

3741
02:50:22,050 --> 02:50:25,740
meticulous chinese factory by people 
that make a pittance.

3742
02:50:25,770 --> 02:50:30,240
They do it right until someone who works
in America can enjoy their football game

3743
02:50:30,241 --> 02:50:31,074
on sunday and get their fucking coffee 
break and by their ram truck and have a 

3744
02:50:35,491 --> 02:50:40,491
good house in a suburbs.
You won't pay $500 more for your fucking

3745
02:50:41,701 --> 02:50:42,534
phone that you got attached to your hip 
to give you bone cancer while you drive 

3746
02:50:47,740 --> 02:50:52,740
your car.
You faggot american $500.

3747
02:50:53,370 --> 02:50:54,203
The exact same phone,
exact same exact 100 percent on 500 

3748
02:50:56,671 --> 02:50:57,504
bucks.
Yeah.

3749
02:50:57,510 --> 02:51:01,590
Do you think the average person,
the average person would pay $50 more?

3750
02:51:01,690 --> 02:51:02,523
No,
I think $50 more as an achievable 

3751
02:51:04,621 --> 02:51:08,190
number,
like $800.

3752
02:51:08,191 --> 02:51:12,210
Difference between the 800 and 1100 and 
most of the time it's getting subsidized

3753
02:51:12,211 --> 02:51:14,270
by your cell phone company.
Most of the times,

3754
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:16,770
like you buy a contract,
you get a phone for a discount,

3755
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,350
like you buy an iphone from verizon or 
what have you.

3756
02:51:19,350 --> 02:51:22,320
You're not spending the full 1200 bucks 
or whatever it is at cost.

3757
02:51:22,590 --> 02:51:23,423
You're spending a part of that and the 
rest of it gets paid off over the years 

3758
02:51:26,731 --> 02:51:27,650
of your contract.
Yeah,

3759
02:51:27,660 --> 02:51:29,370
you can get a five year contract or 
whatever you do,

3760
02:51:29,430 --> 02:51:31,380
but no one ever keeps the funnier it's 
traded back in.

3761
02:51:31,381 --> 02:51:32,214
That restarts jack you back up and then 
within a year so he can get a new phone 

3762
02:51:36,391 --> 02:51:38,160
for free.
You can upgrade for free.

3763
02:51:38,161 --> 02:51:39,990
they want to keep you hooked to the 
fucking tit.

3764
02:51:40,120 --> 02:51:40,953
some the things I don't see how you can 
get better at certain things like I 

3765
02:51:43,351 --> 02:51:44,184
don't like that tests out there.
I don't know how you make a better 

3766
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:49,530
technological car.
There'll be better.

3767
02:51:49,531 --> 02:51:50,364
For sure.

3768
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:54,150
The first edition,
they'll well,

3769
02:51:54,151 --> 02:51:57,870
they'll have much more integrated 
navigation systems,

3770
02:51:58,080 --> 02:52:00,450
navigation systems that have augmented 
reality.

3771
02:52:00,451 --> 02:52:01,284
This is a big thing to do and now with 
phones where they're coming up with 

3772
02:52:03,541 --> 02:52:04,374
applications where you could hold a 
phone up and you a little bit of a scan 

3773
02:52:07,451 --> 02:52:09,640
your neighborhood and find out where the
stores are,

3774
02:52:09,850 --> 02:52:10,683
who could lift it up and like you can go
through the mall and it'll give you 

3775
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:16,690
reviews of each store.
Like augmented put balloons,

3776
02:52:16,691 --> 02:52:20,080
like cartoon balloons.
Like this is the juice factory.

3777
02:52:20,081 --> 02:52:21,520
They have awesome orange juice,
you know,

3778
02:52:21,530 --> 02:52:24,000
and won't point right there.
Ready?

3779
02:52:24,080 --> 02:52:25,960
Yep.
So this is going on right now.

3780
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:28,090
like this is like ready to launch stuff.
Yeah.

3781
02:52:28,091 --> 02:52:29,800
So.
And this is just out of your phone,

3782
02:52:29,801 --> 02:52:31,330
just looking,
lifting up with your phone.

3783
02:52:31,570 --> 02:52:34,000
It's going to get in your car,
so that's going to be in your car.

3784
02:52:34,330 --> 02:52:37,010
There's going to be way better internet.
first of all,

3785
02:52:37,011 --> 02:52:39,160
like podcasts,
like the stuff that you guys are doing,

3786
02:52:39,910 --> 02:52:44,380
it's going to replace radio essentially 
is going to be no reason to hire someone

3787
02:52:44,381 --> 02:52:45,214
to rent a building to broadcast a signal
when you can just get all the 

3788
02:52:49,061 --> 02:52:49,894
information from,
whether it's our combat sports podcast 

3789
02:52:52,841 --> 02:52:56,560
or news podcast or government.
It's going to be on the internet,

3790
02:52:56,561 --> 02:52:58,900
it's going to be like a direct line 
right into your car.

3791
02:52:58,901 --> 02:53:02,320
It's ridiculous that it's not there on 
every car already because it's free.

3792
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:04,810
Like everybody wants something for free.
It's like it's right.

3793
02:53:04,811 --> 02:53:07,660
You can get it at any time.
That's going to be 100 percent the case.

3794
02:53:07,750 --> 02:53:12,220
It's going to be very difficult to sell 
radio or even the idea of a radio signal

3795
02:53:12,250 --> 02:53:15,430
and just a few decades it's going to be.
It's going to be like Payphones.

3796
02:53:15,610 --> 02:53:17,330
Payphones don't exist anymore and be 
like block.

3797
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:20,890
The other thing that we were talking 
about with manufacturing is I think it's

3798
02:53:20,950 --> 02:53:25,630
more likelY that we're going to end up 
having a three d printers,

3799
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:28,720
massive three d printers,
so we'll be able to order what we want.

3800
02:53:28,721 --> 02:53:31,960
That'll be made right in our,
in our jurisdiction and our town,

3801
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:33,440
and then you know,
it's a.

3802
02:53:33,450 --> 02:53:34,283
It's a three minute drive to your house 
with that or you come and pick it up at 

3803
02:53:36,911 --> 02:53:38,170
this main depot.
Right?

3804
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:39,790
Well,
they think that's the number one problem

3805
02:53:39,791 --> 02:53:40,624
with automated.
Like these artificially intelligent 

3806
02:53:42,431 --> 02:53:43,264
computers and all the different things 
they're going to have where they have 

3807
02:53:45,160 --> 02:53:45,993
robots are building cars and shit.
The number one problem is going to be 

3808
02:53:48,701 --> 02:53:49,534
the loss of jobs for skilled workers,
so all these people that are currently 

3809
02:53:51,761 --> 02:53:52,594
doing these things like automated trucks
are going to replace truck drivers to 

3810
02:53:56,510 --> 02:53:57,343
ups,
drivers,

3811
02:53:58,240 --> 02:53:59,660
truck drivers,
all that shake.

3812
02:53:59,660 --> 02:54:04,660
A bulk of a huge bulk of mosT male male 
and blue collar employment is think they

3813
02:54:05,980 --> 02:54:08,320
can go from san francisco,
New York with no sleep.

3814
02:54:08,350 --> 02:54:09,183
I mean your packages,
they can't hit things that literally 

3815
02:54:13,631 --> 02:54:16,150
they see have cameras all around the.
The backoff.

3816
02:54:16,151 --> 02:54:20,430
They've shown a diminished rate of 
accidents with automated cars versus how

3817
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:22,800
you're driving.
I drive my cAr,

3818
02:54:22,860 --> 02:54:25,330
my job,
but still not to do that though.

3819
02:54:25,331 --> 02:54:26,880
Do you ever do it?
You said it all the time.

3820
02:54:27,070 --> 02:54:29,760
Do pay attention or you just don't,
but I do.

3821
02:54:30,060 --> 02:54:30,893
I come to do that.
Could you put porn on that big flat 

3822
02:54:33,791 --> 02:54:36,070
screen in front of you?
You got some guy died,

3823
02:54:36,071 --> 02:54:37,690
right?
So I've been doing it.

3824
02:54:37,691 --> 02:54:38,524
Yeah.
He's going to self-drive jacking off to 

3825
02:54:39,731 --> 02:54:40,564
porn and died.
I'm pretty sure she imagine if that was 

3826
02:54:42,611 --> 02:54:44,050
your shit,
like what do I like to do,

3827
02:54:44,051 --> 02:54:45,220
bro?
To get on the highway,

3828
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:47,030
bring it up to about 75.
Sorry,

3829
02:54:48,370 --> 02:54:49,203
sarah pula.
do those people love to do things like 

3830
02:54:50,921 --> 02:54:52,180
that in public?
Just all.

3831
02:54:52,330 --> 02:54:53,163
All he watches is gagging videos,
just likes running mascara and snotty 

3832
02:54:56,621 --> 02:54:57,454
noses and blah,
and this guy's spitting on his own dick 

3833
02:55:00,881 --> 02:55:01,714
on the highway.

3834
02:55:04,610 --> 02:55:06,060
Of course,
those window,

3835
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:06,983
he's called brian count.
Can you jump in the back seat like can 

3836
02:55:10,430 --> 02:55:13,930
you show now?
Apparently I think what was happening,

3837
02:55:13,960 --> 02:55:16,160
this is what I heard.
I don't know if it's true,

3838
02:55:16,460 --> 02:55:17,293
but guys would get drunk.
They would put there and that their 

3839
02:55:19,911 --> 02:55:22,370
address into their navigation,
the take them home.

3840
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:24,310
I don't know if that's.
And there'd be.

3841
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:27,830
They crawl in the back seat and I think 
tesla found out about that.

3842
02:55:28,070 --> 02:55:30,560
That's a big liability.
It's not ready.

3843
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:33,220
It's not ready yet.
Yeah,

3844
02:55:33,230 --> 02:55:37,370
but if you let someone decide that they 
can press automatic driver,

3845
02:55:37,371 --> 02:55:39,890
you can't decide when they compress it 
and when they can.

3846
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:42,830
Like either it can drive itself 
perfectly or it can't.

3847
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:44,840
It's got to get better,
but if you're drunk,

3848
02:55:44,841 --> 02:55:45,674
okay,
but if it does get better and you're 

3849
02:55:46,131 --> 02:55:46,964
drunk,
is it irresponsible to let it drive 

3850
02:55:48,111 --> 02:55:48,620
home?

3851
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:49,453
No.
I mean it seems like it doesn't really 

3852
02:55:51,111 --> 02:55:52,310
work.
Does it really work?

3853
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:54,830
If it doesn't really work,
why the fuck do you sell in it?

3854
02:55:55,310 --> 02:55:58,700
Why are you selling automated car that 
doesn't 100 percent of the time.

3855
02:55:58,760 --> 02:56:02,370
Every fucking single time work.
Not ready yet.

3856
02:56:02,630 --> 02:56:03,770
They shouldn't.
They shouldn't have released it.

3857
02:56:03,771 --> 02:56:04,604
When it can kind of work.
You currently can only do it if you're 

3858
02:56:06,201 --> 02:56:09,750
in car pool.
If you're over 70 to case you gotta,

3859
02:56:09,860 --> 02:56:10,693
you gotta let drunk shabbat.
What happens to me is when I do self 

3860
02:56:12,641 --> 02:56:14,080
drive,
sometimes it'll just stay.

3861
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:15,520
Did you?
Are you amber?

3862
02:56:15,620 --> 02:56:18,020
We'll you can't or science.
You try to do it and go.

3863
02:56:18,021 --> 02:56:19,430
Not here.
like it won't work.

3864
02:56:20,210 --> 02:56:21,043
It tells you that you just can't.
You click the thing twice towards you 

3865
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:28,730
and sometimes it's not available.
it's like you have a freaky girlfriend,

3866
02:56:28,731 --> 02:56:30,380
but every now and then she turns you 
down.

3867
02:56:30,380 --> 02:56:33,080
Just to give you that little element of 
mystery,

3868
02:56:33,100 --> 02:56:33,933
like is it going to go down or is she 
gonna get mad at me for no fucking 

3869
02:56:36,531 --> 02:56:38,900
reason whatsoever.
Keeping you on your toes.

3870
02:56:39,230 --> 02:56:40,063
Goddamn this freaky bitch.
That's why don't we get done all these 

3871
02:56:41,391 --> 02:56:45,060
tussles about.
I'm not really.

3872
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:48,800
Don't like the tesla.
Well,

3873
02:56:48,801 --> 02:56:51,290
kids,
should we wrap this bitch up and fun.

3874
02:56:51,291 --> 02:56:53,710
I want everybody to know we didn't talk 
about fights at all.

3875
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:55,220
You.
Okay.

3876
02:56:55,220 --> 02:56:58,880
Let's go over to feel drained.
Drained,

3877
02:56:58,910 --> 02:56:59,743
germane to rhonda.
Me should have one or do you think that 

3878
02:57:01,251 --> 02:57:03,980
she should have been deducted points?
She should've been it.

3879
02:57:04,370 --> 02:57:05,203
Worst case should have been a draw a.
I think the right thing to do was holly 

3880
02:57:08,591 --> 02:57:10,620
should have won.
Even deducting those point.

3881
02:57:10,621 --> 02:57:11,454
You have to do that.
Those points and I think even germane 

3882
02:57:12,891 --> 02:57:13,724
realized that when she goes,
I'll give holly a rematch right away 

3883
02:57:15,640 --> 02:57:16,473
because tainted.

3884
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:17,840
She's like,
I'm not a dirty fighter.

3885
02:57:17,841 --> 02:57:19,580
Like she knows what she did was fucked 
up.

3886
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:21,260
Only won that fight.
You think,

3887
02:57:21,261 --> 02:57:23,810
well,
well holly definitely got the only legit

3888
02:57:23,811 --> 02:57:24,980
knocked down.
You know,

3889
02:57:24,981 --> 02:57:26,880
she got that.
She landed that question mark kick.

3890
02:57:26,881 --> 02:57:28,170
That was beautiful.
Beautiful.

3891
02:57:28,171 --> 02:57:31,450
She hid it behind the shoulder,
came over the top planning.

3892
02:57:31,580 --> 02:57:33,590
I gave holly the wind for octagon 
control,

3893
02:57:33,860 --> 02:57:37,590
let you landed more leg kicks and she 
had the only significant strike in the,

3894
02:57:37,670 --> 02:57:40,280
like the big st,
like germain to random.

3895
02:57:40,281 --> 02:57:43,970
He did more damage when she connected,
but she didn't connect as much.

3896
02:57:44,090 --> 02:57:47,270
But then holly did do more damage in two
instances.

3897
02:57:47,271 --> 02:57:48,104
One with the question mark kick and 
another time she dropped her with a 

3898
02:57:50,061 --> 02:57:50,894
straight left.
Yes.

3899
02:57:51,050 --> 02:57:53,600
That was one of the best punches of the 
fight and that was in the,

3900
02:57:53,750 --> 02:57:55,700
I think it was the fourth round last 
round was.

3901
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:58,700
IT might have been the fifth.
She dropped her and it was a.

3902
02:57:58,790 --> 02:58:02,040
It was a big moment.
So you could say that that and the head

3903
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:05,130
kick round two different rounds or both?
Easily 10.

3904
02:58:05,131 --> 02:58:06,060
eight,
right.

3905
02:58:06,290 --> 02:58:10,110
You dropped him with a head kick and the
someone with you don't think so,

3906
02:58:10,950 --> 02:58:13,520
but you understand there's new rules.
The new rules will give them.

3907
02:58:13,610 --> 02:58:15,970
See which one?
Which one's off balance ahead.

3908
02:58:16,150 --> 02:58:16,411
No,
no,

3909
02:58:16,411 --> 02:58:16,980
no,
no.

3910
02:58:16,980 --> 02:58:18,570
She said herself.
She was nasty,

3911
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:20,730
she said herself.
She was days and there's a picture of it

3912
02:58:20,731 --> 02:58:23,550
on mike winkeljohn or jackson 
winkeljohn.

3913
02:58:23,610 --> 02:58:28,320
John's a instagram account where you see
how well it connected.

3914
02:58:28,650 --> 02:58:30,230
It's over the top.
It's just shindig.

3915
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:32,940
Don't do it.
She went down from that.

3916
02:58:32,941 --> 02:58:33,774
That was Legit.
But holly almost kicked her in the face 

3917
02:58:35,161 --> 02:58:39,840
while she was down so she might've.
you're allowed to kick them in the chest

3918
02:58:39,841 --> 02:58:40,674
though.
What's interesting is like if she saw 

3919
02:58:42,031 --> 02:58:42,864
that her hands were down,
she could've just changed the angle a 

3920
02:58:45,031 --> 02:58:45,810
little bit and hit her.

3921
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:48,720
He or she has the skill to do just a 
good rule or a bad room.

3922
02:58:48,810 --> 02:58:51,060
I think the new one handed rule is 
perfect.

3923
02:58:51,240 --> 02:58:52,990
I think that's perfect.
So what does that.

3924
02:58:52,991 --> 02:58:55,290
What does that one hands down you can 
still kick them,

3925
02:58:55,830 --> 02:58:59,190
but if two hands or as soon as one hand 
comes up,

3926
02:58:59,191 --> 02:59:01,050
you can kick him in the face.
But don't you think?

3927
02:59:01,290 --> 02:59:02,123
I think to get rid of it,
I gouging a hitting after the bell and 

3928
02:59:05,970 --> 02:59:06,803
even growing kicks.
There's zero tolerance policy where if 

3929
02:59:09,991 --> 02:59:10,824
it happens,
we got to the point 100 percent up to 

3930
02:59:12,271 --> 02:59:15,240
the ref anymore because ralph's don't 
want to change outcome with the fight.

3931
02:59:15,241 --> 02:59:17,160
So there they're so skewed to deduct a 
point.

3932
02:59:17,280 --> 02:59:20,820
What she did to holly is ridiculous.
She's been twice already.

3933
02:59:20,910 --> 02:59:23,040
Too many fights.
She hit her so hard.

3934
02:59:23,041 --> 02:59:24,280
It changed outcome of the fight.
Yeah.

3935
02:59:24,460 --> 02:59:27,270
Holding onto one.
she rocked her with a giant righthand at

3936
02:59:27,271 --> 02:59:28,104
the end of the bell and it was bad.
It was bad to the point where we all 

3937
02:59:30,301 --> 02:59:30,991
went,
oh,

3938
02:59:30,991 --> 02:59:32,880
like daniel cormier was next to me.
horrible.

3939
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:36,090
It was the first time I did commentary 
with cormier and uh,

3940
02:59:36,091 --> 02:59:38,310
an annex like the three of us together.
It was really good.

3941
02:59:38,630 --> 02:59:40,050
chromium was great.
It was interesting.

3942
02:59:40,510 --> 02:59:42,940
pens will kind of judge.
You got judged in the fight,

3943
02:59:42,941 --> 02:59:46,300
but some,
some judges would look at it the way you

3944
02:59:46,301 --> 02:59:48,370
guys are looking at based on what you 
guys said.

3945
02:59:48,450 --> 02:59:50,110
And some would say the right way.
And then someone said,

3946
02:59:50,111 --> 02:59:50,944
yeah.
And then when others would look at it 

3947
02:59:51,821 --> 02:59:52,451
like,
okay,

3948
02:59:52,451 --> 02:59:56,020
holly was trying to take her down,
look like she was avoiding the standup,

3949
02:59:56,170 --> 02:59:58,720
couldn't take her down,
she had her against the cage.

3950
02:59:58,721 --> 02:59:59,554
It was like some judges will look at 
that as she doesn't want to fight 

3951
03:00:02,351 --> 03:00:04,870
standing and she's not able to get the 
fight to the ground.

3952
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:07,690
She's kinda just holding against the 
cage for safety.

3953
03:00:07,810 --> 03:00:10,870
Some people look at that as losing 
around and not winning around.

3954
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:12,230
You'll know what I mean.

3955
03:00:13,030 --> 03:00:15,500
she wants to get free.
It's octagon control.

3956
03:00:16,100 --> 03:00:17,940
She wants to get free and she can't get 
free.

3957
03:00:17,941 --> 03:00:22,941
That been holly's holding her against 
the rules.

3958
03:00:23,590 --> 03:00:25,410
That's the only way.
That's how they judge a fight.

3959
03:00:25,411 --> 03:00:26,244
That's one way to judge a fight.
The problem is is that that referee 

3960
03:00:29,130 --> 03:00:30,600
didn't want to change that come to the 
fight.

3961
03:00:30,601 --> 03:00:32,790
They're so scared of the backlash.
They don't.

3962
03:00:32,820 --> 03:00:33,653
They don't do it.
So you need to take that power out of 

3963
03:00:34,981 --> 03:00:35,814
their hands and go.
Three was separating people when they 

3964
03:00:38,041 --> 03:00:38,874
were clenching.
There's a lot more on the New York 

3965
03:00:41,791 --> 03:00:44,370
should not Have those big fire.
You can't believe what you just said.

3966
03:00:44,430 --> 03:00:47,700
I'm surprised they let him even do that 
title fight.

3967
03:00:47,730 --> 03:00:49,020
They have to.
It's New York state.

3968
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:49,913
New york state is going to appoint their
own referees and a certain amount of 

3969
03:00:52,651 --> 03:00:55,140
fights and I don't know how many.
I don't know how it works.

3970
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:55,973
I don't know what the agreement is,
but that's often the case when you go 

3971
03:00:58,021 --> 03:01:00,490
into state athletic commission,
the Joe Mccarthy,

3972
03:01:00,491 --> 03:01:01,324
herb dean levine,
you have to some of the best in the 

3973
03:01:05,441 --> 03:01:06,274
world.
Mccarthy or herb dean come out and make 

3974
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:10,770
a statement and John John Mccarthy said,
uh,

3975
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:12,850
they should have issued a warning bride 
away,

3976
03:01:12,851 --> 03:01:15,580
like a strict warning on that first one,
which I disagree with,

3977
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:17,370
and he goes on the second one,
I would have took a point.

3978
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:18,760
They should take an appointment right 
away.

3979
03:01:19,300 --> 03:01:20,110
Yeah,
I agree.

3980
03:01:20,110 --> 03:01:20,943
I agree for absolutely the second one,
but I think the first one was so 

3981
03:01:23,261 --> 03:01:28,261
egregious crap,
boom combo to take the point.

3982
03:01:29,081 --> 03:01:31,130
I'm just not buying that,
that you know,

3983
03:01:31,131 --> 03:01:33,880
like I get the heat of the moment.
You can't let that happen.

3984
03:01:33,940 --> 03:01:35,380
I get that you're in the heat of the 
moment,

3985
03:01:35,381 --> 03:01:36,214
you want to kill and destroy it and 
you're to random me and you've got 46 

3986
03:01:38,850 --> 03:01:39,683
million more tie and you're a 10 time 
more thai champion cause you're a 

3987
03:01:41,651 --> 03:01:42,490
fucking killer.

3988
03:01:42,610 --> 03:01:44,590
She's a killer man.
I mean that's what she is.

3989
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:47,200
But there's a rule that was the rule.
You know,

3990
03:01:47,201 --> 03:01:48,880
you know what was going on,
you know what was going on.

3991
03:01:48,910 --> 03:01:51,640
You've been in 46 fights before that.
You never did that.

3992
03:01:51,641 --> 03:01:54,570
So all of a sudden you do in the heat of
the moment to see immediately,

3993
03:01:54,870 --> 03:01:57,360
twice immediate rematch.
That one $45.

3994
03:01:57,400 --> 03:01:58,510
Shit.
I think so.

3995
03:01:58,511 --> 03:02:00,670
I would say you have to have immediate 
rematch too,

3996
03:02:00,820 --> 03:02:04,060
but germane to randomly look,
everybody knows the cyborg is looming in

3997
03:02:04,061 --> 03:02:05,410
the background.
You know,

3998
03:02:05,440 --> 03:02:07,930
cyborg is always going to be there.
There's no winner in this.

3999
03:02:07,931 --> 03:02:10,260
I mean holly should have one,
but you have to fight cyborg next.

4000
03:02:10,300 --> 03:02:11,580
Enjoy that.
Yeah.

4001
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:13,390
It's,
it's to be really no winter.

4002
03:02:13,391 --> 03:02:15,460
It's going to be really interesting to 
see what the choice is.

4003
03:02:15,461 --> 03:02:16,294
Whether or not to go straight to a 
rematch or whether or not they let 

4004
03:02:19,601 --> 03:02:22,680
cyborg five,
45 and nightmare for her to suck down to

4005
03:02:22,900 --> 03:02:25,210
know 40 years she's done 45 many times.

4006
03:02:25,210 --> 03:02:26,320
It's not easy.
Here's the deal.

4007
03:02:26,321 --> 03:02:28,240
As you get older and you do it more 
often,

4008
03:02:28,241 --> 03:02:31,930
your body resists it more and more and 
more and the fact that they make her.

4009
03:02:31,931 --> 03:02:32,764
I still maintain to this day,
they should have never asked her to go 

4010
03:02:35,771 --> 03:02:36,604
to 1:40.
They should never have been trying to 

4011
03:02:37,841 --> 03:02:38,674
get her to 1:35.
They should have just either have a 

4012
03:02:41,471 --> 03:02:43,840
featherweight division or don't.
She said she could do it though.

4013
03:02:43,890 --> 03:02:44,930
Oh,
she's so crazy.

4014
03:02:44,980 --> 03:02:45,880
Met with her and she was like,
yeah,

4015
03:02:45,881 --> 03:02:47,710
we can do it.
So that's cool man.

4016
03:02:47,830 --> 03:02:50,580
There's so many fighters that that 
dropped down a couple of weight classes.

4017
03:02:50,581 --> 03:02:53,010
That's a normal thing in mma.
So big.

4018
03:02:53,240 --> 03:02:57,610
So big brother.
You get smaller and smaller people.

4019
03:02:57,890 --> 03:02:59,950
Forty five,
48 class.

4020
03:02:59,951 --> 03:03:01,750
She could make 45.
She's done it before,

4021
03:03:01,751 --> 03:03:04,270
but even now,
like as people get older again,

4022
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:05,393
like there's a lot.

4023
03:03:05,980 --> 03:03:07,900
It gets tougher and tougher and they 
can't do it anymore.

4024
03:03:07,960 --> 03:03:09,490
You know?
Some guys just can't do it anymore.

4025
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:10,353
Just hendrix is exactly the johnny.
This sunday we're doing a fight 

4026
03:03:14,101 --> 03:03:15,910
companion or are we doing it?
Let's do it.

4027
03:03:15,911 --> 03:03:17,260
Oh sure.
You here sunday.

4028
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:21,970
I'm going to be in nashville.
Nashville days.

4029
03:03:21,971 --> 03:03:22,541
Thursday,
friday,

4030
03:03:22,541 --> 03:03:24,100
saturday.
Everybody comes to me this weekend,

4031
03:03:24,101 --> 03:03:27,700
but then that sunday I fly back sunday 
but I haven't seen my family in.

4032
03:03:27,800 --> 03:03:28,990
Okay.
We'll see him in the morning.

4033
03:03:29,380 --> 03:03:32,440
Make waffles and I'll see if I can do 
what time?

4034
03:03:32,890 --> 03:03:34,890
probably 6:00.
I think 6:00

4035
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:37,660
because it's 7:00.
People will freak out.

4036
03:03:37,870 --> 03:03:39,500
You got hector lumbar.
Johnny hendricks?

4037
03:03:39,520 --> 03:03:40,130
Yeah,
that's what I was gonna.

4038
03:03:40,130 --> 03:03:42,010
Say Johnny Hendricks fight and hector 
lombard,

4039
03:03:42,011 --> 03:03:45,370
his first 185 pound fight that fight for
johnny.

4040
03:03:45,490 --> 03:03:46,840
It's not a good thing.
No,

4041
03:03:46,940 --> 03:03:50,350
goddamn lombard.
Looks so jacked right now.

4042
03:03:50,410 --> 03:03:53,150
I haven't seen a photo.

4043
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:55,600
There was a photo of him like a 
post-training,

4044
03:03:55,780 --> 03:03:59,420
like flexing his abs and I.
He so jack them at 85.

4045
03:03:59,421 --> 03:04:03,900
He can just eat whatever he wants to 
cratejoy that Johnny Hendricks hendricks

4046
03:04:03,990 --> 03:04:08,990
is powerful and explosive and 85.
He never fought at 85.

4047
03:04:10,130 --> 03:04:12,600
He's had such a hard time sucking.
It's management.

4048
03:04:12,890 --> 03:04:17,270
Johnny five.
Jesus fucking christ.

4049
03:04:18,500 --> 03:04:22,940
One person who wants that guy.
He's so jack.

4050
03:04:23,900 --> 03:04:25,820
He's lost his last two though.
Yeah,

4051
03:04:25,821 --> 03:04:28,940
but he lost a damn fucking henderson and
who you lose two before that.

4052
03:04:28,941 --> 03:04:30,180
Oh,
the old magnet magnet.

4053
03:04:30,400 --> 03:04:33,680
Neil magazine was oppressive because he 
had neil magnet out.

4054
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:36,170
Amazing.
Crazy.

4055
03:04:36,171 --> 03:04:39,050
That was amazing.
You look how tough neil magnet has to be

4056
03:04:39,051 --> 03:04:41,390
to survive the onslaught of that first 
round.

4057
03:04:41,870 --> 03:04:44,510
Like he got cry.
He wants to fight with jorge mas.

4058
03:04:44,511 --> 03:04:45,344
We don't know what the fun one,
but it's in my head of him in the 

4059
03:04:49,101 --> 03:04:49,520
rankings.

4060
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:52,490
Now he is.
He got his shot at number five.

4061
03:04:52,491 --> 03:04:54,880
Why can't you know?
Neil's ranked seven or eighth.

4062
03:04:54,890 --> 03:04:55,723
Why can't you get a shot?
Here's the fight to set up mazda doll 

4063
03:04:59,751 --> 03:05:02,570
versus damien maia for the number one 
contender,

4064
03:05:02,571 --> 03:05:05,900
but this fucked up to damien has already
got damien's only one though.

4065
03:05:05,930 --> 03:05:10,250
Number one it because they have to have 
this fucking rematch.

4066
03:05:10,860 --> 03:05:12,240
Robbie,
lots of good mac.

4067
03:05:12,340 --> 03:05:13,173
That's a good match because he probably 
laughed bad blood this summer and 

4068
03:05:17,391 --> 03:05:18,650
they'll black.
No bang.

4069
03:05:18,670 --> 03:05:19,850
Help those two.
Hold on.

4070
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:22,670
Wouldn't you rather see cowboy versus 
robbie lawler?

4071
03:05:24,060 --> 03:05:25,010
Yeah,
yeah,

4072
03:05:25,110 --> 03:05:26,120
yeah.
Know what?

4073
03:05:26,480 --> 03:05:27,920
I don't want to see it anytime soon.
Cowboy,

4074
03:05:27,950 --> 03:05:30,080
take a goddamn break.
How much of a time?

4075
03:05:30,570 --> 03:05:32,060
At least six months.
Six months.

4076
03:05:32,120 --> 03:05:33,200
Six months,
no training,

4077
03:05:33,201 --> 03:05:35,290
no.
In pursuit of the title right now.

4078
03:05:35,291 --> 03:05:37,040
It's kind of chill.
It's got nothing to prove.

4079
03:05:37,041 --> 03:05:38,570
He's amazing.
He's done this thing.

4080
03:05:38,750 --> 03:05:39,583
I wonder if there's a way where you can 
tell how long a guy should take off 

4081
03:05:43,580 --> 03:05:47,210
after they get a severe knockout.
Like a wonder if there's tests that they

4082
03:05:47,211 --> 03:05:49,330
can do where they can tell you,
you know,

4083
03:05:49,550 --> 03:05:52,910
you fuck up your meniscus,
they give you a scope and they go look.

4084
03:05:52,970 --> 03:05:55,820
Just be real easy on it.
Exactly.

4085
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:57,470
Yeah.
They have like a time limit and they can

4086
03:05:57,471 --> 03:05:59,240
look at it and then they can do an mri 
afterwards.

4087
03:05:59,241 --> 03:06:00,200
Hey,
you're looking good brendon.

4088
03:06:00,570 --> 03:06:02,510
So we're going to authorize some light 
training,

4089
03:06:02,511 --> 03:06:05,190
but please take it easy.
Let's see how we can do it.

4090
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:06,990
The reaction drill.
Kenny,

4091
03:06:07,020 --> 03:06:07,730
did they do it?
Uh,

4092
03:06:07,730 --> 03:06:09,740
it's a test reaction to in football we 
used to do,

4093
03:06:09,750 --> 03:06:11,810
if you've got concussed you,
uh,

4094
03:06:11,990 --> 03:06:14,180
before the season you do the test,
see how fast you are,

4095
03:06:14,190 --> 03:06:15,830
and then if you got concussed,
they make you do it.

4096
03:06:15,830 --> 03:06:17,060
See how fast you go.
Whoa.

4097
03:06:17,150 --> 03:06:20,240
And then you do it two weeks later to 
see what is it comprised of?

4098
03:06:20,680 --> 03:06:21,450
Uh,
it's like,

4099
03:06:21,450 --> 03:06:25,430
it's like the,
all these different objects and you have

4100
03:06:25,431 --> 03:06:28,310
to touch it when they blink and then 
you've got to put patterns together.

4101
03:06:28,580 --> 03:06:29,271
Oh wow.
Oh,

4102
03:06:29,271 --> 03:06:30,250
lIke,
sorta like that.

4103
03:06:30,280 --> 03:06:31,790
What was that game?
Simon?

4104
03:06:32,590 --> 03:06:34,490
Yay.
There you go simon.

4105
03:06:34,491 --> 03:06:37,160
But with shapes,
shapes and colors,

4106
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:39,700
and then you'd have a certain timeline 
if you didn't.

4107
03:06:39,710 --> 03:06:41,860
Forty six seconds.
If you're a concussion,

4108
03:06:41,870 --> 03:06:42,703
did in two minutes,
is it two weeks later you're back to 

4109
03:06:44,481 --> 03:06:45,314
your normal.
that's really interesting that we have 

4110
03:06:46,851 --> 03:06:47,684
it that way because some people would 
argue that there's some stupid 

4111
03:06:49,761 --> 03:06:51,790
motherfuckers out there.
It doesn't matter if they're concussed,

4112
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:53,570
there's still going to suck at that 
worst than you are.

4113
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:54,220
Well,
If they say,

4114
03:06:54,220 --> 03:06:57,070
let me back,
and guys a moron,

4115
03:06:57,080 --> 03:06:59,610
he can't remember his own fucking name 
and you let him play every week.

4116
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:00,453
We're shooting coach.
I'm sure there's better ways brain we 

4117
03:07:03,211 --> 03:07:04,890
just can't get into.
But that's the thing is,

4118
03:07:04,891 --> 03:07:05,724
is not better ways.
one of the scariest things about cte is 

4119
03:07:07,890 --> 03:07:08,723
they can't really,
really check to see what you have until 

4120
03:07:10,741 --> 03:07:12,990
after dead.
How is that the case?

4121
03:07:13,110 --> 03:07:17,180
How come they can't see that with mris 
is that mri just aren't as effective yet

4122
03:07:17,250 --> 03:07:19,320
that matter doesn't show up,
does it?

4123
03:07:19,530 --> 03:07:21,870
There are a lot of issues in the mris 
they did.

4124
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:25,560
They did an mri on a dead salmon and 
certain parts of the brain lit up.

4125
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:27,630
So you got to be very obvious.
Jesus,

4126
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:29,000
maybe,
maybe it's gone,

4127
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:31,270
don't necessarily tell you,
uh,

4128
03:07:31,470 --> 03:07:32,460
uh,
like when they say,

4129
03:07:32,490 --> 03:07:33,323
oh,
this part of your brain lit up when you 

4130
03:07:34,171 --> 03:07:36,300
were doing this,
when you were thinking about this,

4131
03:07:36,740 --> 03:07:38,310
this a little bit misleading,
it's not.

4132
03:07:38,810 --> 03:07:42,930
Why is that like a shock that like some 
area of their brain,

4133
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:43,793
even though the body's dead might have 
some weird connection to the great 

4134
03:07:47,791 --> 03:07:52,590
beyond while they're sitting there at 
the fulton fish market on a pile of ice,

4135
03:07:52,591 --> 03:07:53,424
like there's some part of their brain 
tuning into the god force of the 

4136
03:07:57,781 --> 03:08:00,750
universe and we just say it's over four 
men.

4137
03:08:00,750 --> 03:08:03,330
Look no gills.
We already go to him.

4138
03:08:03,510 --> 03:08:04,343
It's over and he's there and his little 
fucking fish head traveling through 

4139
03:08:09,610 --> 03:08:12,300
dimensions.
I always wondered why when they cut your

4140
03:08:12,301 --> 03:08:13,220
head off,
when,

4141
03:08:13,390 --> 03:08:15,080
when to kill a tree,
when they cut your head off,

4142
03:08:15,500 --> 03:08:18,140
they'd see people mouthing prayers while
they were still doing it.

4143
03:08:18,180 --> 03:08:19,013
Good.
So as you are you conscious of your 

4144
03:08:20,581 --> 03:08:23,430
brain as oxygen,
you get your head cut off right away,

4145
03:08:23,470 --> 03:08:24,303
but who are you looking?
Is it possible for your head and your 

4146
03:08:27,301 --> 03:08:30,270
brain to be looking at your headless 
body?

4147
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:31,231
For sure.
No,

4148
03:08:31,231 --> 03:08:32,064
it is.
Here's the deal because when you head 

4149
03:08:32,911 --> 03:08:33,744
gets cut off,
the blood's not pumping through your 

4150
03:08:35,491 --> 03:08:36,090
head.
It's gonna.

4151
03:08:36,090 --> 03:08:37,470
Stay there.
Okay.

4152
03:08:37,471 --> 03:08:39,510
Your second.
Just some of it's going to spill out.

4153
03:08:39,570 --> 03:08:40,403
whatever's there is going to carry 
oxygen to your fucking stupid brain for 

4154
03:08:43,051 --> 03:08:46,200
as long as you stay alive and it's only 
gonna be a few seconds,

4155
03:08:46,290 --> 03:08:48,870
so if you're lying there and there's 
still blood in your brain,

4156
03:08:48,871 --> 03:08:50,100
you're looking over at your head,
you're like,

4157
03:08:50,160 --> 03:08:50,993
oh my god,
and coming out of your mouth because 

4158
03:08:53,251 --> 03:08:55,170
you're not attached to your lungs 
anymore.

4159
03:08:55,290 --> 03:08:56,250
Yeah,
that's what they did.

4160
03:08:57,400 --> 03:09:00,180
Shot in the heart.
You die like right away,

4161
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:01,800
like you have all those.
No,

4162
03:09:01,801 --> 03:09:03,390
you don't.
You don't die right away.

4163
03:09:03,450 --> 03:09:06,210
You guys really quickly.
Your body takes a few seconds.

4164
03:09:06,300 --> 03:09:08,550
it takes a few seconds,
but if he had a shotgun,

4165
03:09:08,551 --> 03:09:10,200
just blow a hole through your chest.
You would.

4166
03:09:10,410 --> 03:09:11,420
You wouldn't be alone.
In Texas.

4167
03:09:12,290 --> 03:09:15,030
You still get the oxygenated blood in 
your brain.

4168
03:09:15,060 --> 03:09:16,170
Although when you get your,
your,

4169
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:19,230
your head blown off the road when you're
going to be severed that quickly.

4170
03:09:19,231 --> 03:09:21,750
It doesn't knock you out though 
sometimes.

4171
03:09:21,780 --> 03:09:22,613
I'm sure in some cases there were there 
they said that the the size of the head 

4172
03:09:26,460 --> 03:09:29,070
would still be mouthing prayers as it 
was.

4173
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:30,360
I can only imagine,
man.

4174
03:09:31,110 --> 03:09:31,943
It was just always a well known that 
when you her head cut off to be saying 

4175
03:09:37,741 --> 03:09:38,574
things,
but I bet there's a book called a 

4176
03:09:40,630 --> 03:09:42,960
history of the guillotine.
Could you have imagined this doctor?

4177
03:09:43,090 --> 03:09:43,923
Imagine being a town square.
They decided some fucking pickpocket 

4178
03:09:46,470 --> 03:09:49,140
needs to get his head caught off in 
front of everybody and get to see.

4179
03:09:50,040 --> 03:09:51,960
That was the containment.
I know,

4180
03:09:51,961 --> 03:09:54,130
but how crazy is that?
Imagine watching

4181
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:54,963
that big thing dropped down on someone's
head and the fucking head hit the 

4182
03:09:57,041 --> 03:10:00,940
basket.
We're still in to it.

4183
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:03,190
Those ices vetoes are bigger than 
effort.

4184
03:10:03,240 --> 03:10:05,340
It's more views than ever.
Didn't Mississippi?

4185
03:10:05,350 --> 03:10:07,000
Just it.
Was it Mississippi?

4186
03:10:07,001 --> 03:10:09,640
They just passed a law allowing firing 
squad executions.

4187
03:10:09,641 --> 03:10:10,900
Again,
that's some redneck shit.

4188
03:10:11,380 --> 03:10:13,660
Sipping.
I think it might be Mississippi.

4189
03:10:14,170 --> 03:10:15,003
Every message y'all.
Are they having problems getting the 

4190
03:10:17,591 --> 03:10:18,940
medicine or the.
Yeah,

4191
03:10:18,941 --> 03:10:20,470
so they just plenty of bullets down 
there.

4192
03:10:20,471 --> 03:10:21,304
Fuck it mean it is kind of weird that 
there's like a good way in a bad way to 

4193
03:10:23,831 --> 03:10:24,664
kill.
People still have public executions and 

4194
03:10:27,401 --> 03:10:28,234
they had the guy,
they're really the sword and he comes 

4195
03:10:30,641 --> 03:10:34,080
out and you brought out and I believe 
you're there,

4196
03:10:34,310 --> 03:10:35,440
you're,
you're,

4197
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:36,753
somebody says a blessing over you.
You were able to say some prayers and 

4198
03:10:39,371 --> 03:10:42,730
then I believe my dad witnessed this a 
couple times.

4199
03:10:43,180 --> 03:10:45,880
It's a public thing.
And you squat down.

4200
03:10:45,910 --> 03:10:47,140
Dad witnessed this.
Yeah,

4201
03:10:47,141 --> 03:10:49,300
because there's officers right there.
You get on your knees.

4202
03:10:49,301 --> 03:10:51,490
So he's just sat up there.
And why did he go out and watch it?

4203
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,610
He could actually see some of it from 
his window.

4204
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:56,620
Apparently his office window but prime 
spot.

4205
03:10:56,650 --> 03:10:59,920
But yes,
he was there and he saw it and my mother

4206
03:10:59,921 --> 03:11:02,740
saw it too.
And so the guy would be his hands,

4207
03:11:02,741 --> 03:11:03,574
I believe were tied behind.
His back is forced to squat and what 

4208
03:11:05,201 --> 03:11:08,530
they'll do is if they're good,
they'll jab you a little bit.

4209
03:11:08,531 --> 03:11:11,140
So you stiffen and then boom,
really quickly the head comes off.

4210
03:11:11,320 --> 03:11:14,050
so they jab me in the back and they say 
your body so you don't sway.

4211
03:11:14,110 --> 03:11:14,830
So here,
you know,

4212
03:11:14,830 --> 03:11:17,800
and then it comes right off.
Or they still do.

4213
03:11:17,830 --> 03:11:19,830
They still have the death penalty in 
California.

4214
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:21,130
Um,
last ad they do,

4215
03:11:21,131 --> 03:11:23,180
but they haven't killed anybody here in 
quite a while.

4216
03:11:23,420 --> 03:11:26,620
We're these the kill people with gas 
chambers is the most evil,

4217
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:31,760
not extra city electricity when it 
doesn't work.

4218
03:11:32,860 --> 03:11:36,340
What's weird is that like real violence,
like bullets is what we frowned upon the

4219
03:11:36,341 --> 03:11:37,174
real effective way.
Like shooting someone that had put a 

4220
03:11:38,261 --> 03:11:39,094
gun.
Right.

4221
03:11:39,340 --> 03:11:40,121
Blow it away.
Yeah.

4222
03:11:40,121 --> 03:11:43,530
The most cheapest,
easiest way for some.

4223
03:11:43,540 --> 03:11:46,510
That's ridiculous.
It should attend humane for sure.

4224
03:11:46,511 --> 03:11:47,344
What works.
But so a gas chamber is supposed to be 

4225
03:11:49,541 --> 03:11:51,100
humane.
I'm saying shoot him.

4226
03:11:51,101 --> 03:11:52,740
It's obviously cheaper than the way to 
go.

4227
03:11:52,890 --> 03:11:55,630
Are they doing,
are they using the gas chamber because I

4228
03:11:55,631 --> 03:11:57,610
try to be humane or,
or are they trying to be evil?

4229
03:11:58,290 --> 03:12:03,290
Get figure out a way to do it where it 
seems more systematic than a bullet will

4230
03:12:03,401 --> 03:12:04,234
also be more injections.
So I think now lethal injection is the 

4231
03:12:07,271 --> 03:12:08,104
most common.

4232
03:12:08,430 --> 03:12:10,020
Was the gas chamber,
is that,

4233
03:12:10,150 --> 03:12:10,983
was it to be humane in California or is 
it to be an evil and we're going to get 

4234
03:12:15,131 --> 03:12:16,160
revenge on you?
Kill.

4235
03:12:16,190 --> 03:12:19,930
I believe that public execution,
as it was done in this country,

4236
03:12:19,931 --> 03:12:22,840
whether it was through anything,
whether it was hanging,

4237
03:12:22,841 --> 03:12:25,420
whether it was electric chair,
whether it was gas chamber,

4238
03:12:25,660 --> 03:12:26,493
there was always the idea that it was 
supposed to be done at least by the 

4239
03:12:29,921 --> 03:12:32,110
state in a dignified manner,
not enough,

4240
03:12:32,140 --> 03:12:32,973
not,
not in a way that constitutes cruel and 

4241
03:12:35,651 --> 03:12:37,160
unusual punishment.
For example,

4242
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:38,140
what's,
what's uh,

4243
03:12:38,390 --> 03:12:40,350
so you would never talk to somebody to 
death.

4244
03:12:40,380 --> 03:12:42,670
You try to make it as quickly as 
possible,

4245
03:12:42,671 --> 03:12:45,220
as systematic as possible.
The state says you have to die.

4246
03:12:45,430 --> 03:12:46,263
You give your life up for the crime.
You committed an eye for an eye and 

4247
03:12:48,491 --> 03:12:51,010
that's done in a very sort of 
antiseptic,

4248
03:12:51,020 --> 03:12:52,010
systematic way,

4249
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:54,560
but you fucked up.
You know,

4250
03:12:54,561 --> 03:12:55,394
you fucked up when you're strapped to a 
chair and you're looking up and all the 

4251
03:12:58,251 --> 03:12:59,084
people that were friends with the person
who killed are staring at you and 

4252
03:13:02,661 --> 03:13:03,494
they're about to cook.
You go about to fucking screw this 

4253
03:13:05,991 --> 03:13:10,991
electrical down on your bed.
You can't listen to even more fucked up,

4254
03:13:16,150 --> 03:13:16,983
but you can't see them.
I think the reason they don't shoot you 

4255
03:13:21,471 --> 03:13:22,940
in the head is to that you know the 
family.

4256
03:13:22,941 --> 03:13:24,860
If the family wants to have an open 
casket,

4257
03:13:24,861 --> 03:13:27,730
funeral and all that goes out the window
if you killed.

4258
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:28,490
No,
it's.

4259
03:13:28,490 --> 03:13:29,323
We know what's really fucked up.
The whole thing was that they give you 

4260
03:13:31,070 --> 03:13:33,680
your choice of what you get to eat.
Oh yeah.

4261
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:36,430
You get a last meal.
You get to pick your last meal.

4262
03:13:36,650 --> 03:13:38,480
Oh yeah,
you can fuck you in ell sandwich.

4263
03:13:38,481 --> 03:13:40,370
We keys and shit yet man.
Kevin,

4264
03:13:40,371 --> 03:13:42,730
nice beer and ice cold beer with it.
This guy asked me,

4265
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:44,660
how would you like to go if you had a 
choice?

4266
03:13:44,780 --> 03:13:47,900
Electric chair,
gas chamber or lethal injection.

4267
03:13:47,901 --> 03:13:49,610
Packable greens,
so that in there as well.

4268
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:51,290
Lethal injection because they put you to
sleep.

4269
03:13:51,291 --> 03:13:54,410
first 50 will run.
What about between electric chair or gas

4270
03:13:54,411 --> 03:13:55,340
chamber?
Fuck,

4271
03:13:55,341 --> 03:13:56,770
I don't know.
Electric.

4272
03:13:56,810 --> 03:13:58,130
You have to choose one.
Fuck.

4273
03:13:58,131 --> 03:14:00,170
Come on.
Get off the table.

4274
03:14:00,230 --> 03:14:01,063
You,
you,

4275
03:14:01,070 --> 03:14:03,380
you go into convulsions.
You foam at the mouth.

4276
03:14:06,500 --> 03:14:07,333
I like how they have to hit you again.
Sometimes hit them again with the 

4277
03:14:10,731 --> 03:14:13,070
electric chair.
It didn't work and they tried it twice.

4278
03:14:13,420 --> 03:14:15,740
It didn't work on the dude and now they 
can't kill them.

4279
03:14:15,770 --> 03:14:18,650
Do you bleed to death?
We talked about this before.

4280
03:14:18,651 --> 03:14:23,651
Those killings and faces of death.
Some of them are definitely.

4281
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:26,990
They're all real creation.
Some of them are definitely real.

4282
03:14:27,130 --> 03:14:29,630
There was a really,
really real one where they have this guy

4283
03:14:29,631 --> 03:14:30,464
from the middle east.
They tied them to two different trucks 

4284
03:14:31,881 --> 03:14:36,310
and pull them apart.
That shit's real documentary.

4285
03:14:36,311 --> 03:14:37,144
It was on youtube that set the whole.
It was about the guys who put it 

4286
03:14:40,281 --> 03:14:41,660
together.
They're being interviewed.

4287
03:14:41,661 --> 03:14:42,494
The guys,
they'll do everything and they show you 

4288
03:14:45,171 --> 03:14:47,360
how they did the monkey brain.
They said,

4289
03:14:47,420 --> 03:14:48,350
oh,
that's definitely fake.

4290
03:14:48,770 --> 03:14:50,160
It's all fake.
All of it.

4291
03:14:50,360 --> 03:14:53,180
Where they eddie,
but it had.

4292
03:14:53,180 --> 03:14:54,013
Hold on a second 80.
That's not true because like that 

4293
03:14:55,071 --> 03:14:57,410
fucking judge shot himself on 
television.

4294
03:14:57,620 --> 03:15:00,290
What's that guy's name from that song?
Hey man.

4295
03:15:00,291 --> 03:15:02,060
Nice shot dwyer,
dwyer.

4296
03:15:02,090 --> 03:15:05,990
That guy is in faces of death and that 
guy really shut the fucking ones.

4297
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:10,340
I don't remember which one he was in.
I saw something with the guys who put it

4298
03:15:10,341 --> 03:15:12,230
together,
that directors or they put it together,

4299
03:15:12,320 --> 03:15:13,153
they're talking about different people 
in the scenes and they're going through 

4300
03:15:14,421 --> 03:15:15,254
it,
but there's a guy who jumped off and he 

4301
03:15:16,541 --> 03:15:18,800
definitely.
That was a lot of people that dIed.

4302
03:15:18,830 --> 03:15:20,010
I think the whole thing was faked.

4303
03:15:22,480 --> 03:15:23,870
It all knows my child.
No,

4304
03:15:23,871 --> 03:15:26,480
they didn't see.
They had some real footage and some fake

4305
03:15:26,481 --> 03:15:28,590
foot is.
They have some real live events.

4306
03:15:28,790 --> 03:15:31,610
I saw a documentary about each scene.
Oh,

4307
03:15:31,611 --> 03:15:33,230
then we'll just chalk that up.
Is true.

4308
03:15:33,260 --> 03:15:34,730
It was on youtube though.
I do.

4309
03:15:34,731 --> 03:15:39,731
I'll admit that will lend it to know 
that it's already 6:30

4310
03:15:41,140 --> 03:15:43,100
for got sick.
I take care of my dog.

4311
03:15:43,640 --> 03:15:48,440
Take your dog.
So sunday fight companion,

4312
03:15:48,620 --> 03:15:49,453
6:00
PM pacific time for travis browne vs 

4313
03:15:52,351 --> 03:15:56,250
derrick lewis and hector lombard versus 
Johnny Hendricks.

4314
03:15:56,280 --> 03:15:57,630
Those are actually two pretty good 
fIghts.

4315
03:15:57,670 --> 03:15:59,760
That should be interesting.
So that sunday,

4316
03:15:59,940 --> 03:16:01,770

Bye everybody.
