1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,160
Her low freak bitches,
like going to a Korean restaurant.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,840
My one of my buddies is Roy Choi.
I haven't talked to him forever,

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,820
but we used to live next to,
he did a,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,570
he's the chef and he out him on the 
podcast and uh,

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,620
well he took us,
he did a,

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,470
he does the Kogi Taco truck.
He's got him on the podcast.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,370
Yeah,
no,

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,100
no,
you did 100% wrong.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,990
Nope.
He,

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,970
he came in with Eddie Wong.
But Roy Choi is a very famous chef.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,670
One of the most famous famous chefs in 
La Right now.

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,830
Not Episode was this type in Roikoi uh,
Joe Rogan.

13
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,320
I promise you.
As I watched it and I was like,

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,730
so he was with Eddie?
Yeah.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,313
No,
nope.

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,750
He was,
no,

17
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,460
I'm a hundred percent certain.
Well,

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,530
I fight fight that.
Google's right.

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,120
Nope.
I am 100% certain.

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,080
Eddie Wong came in one time with the guy
that was in that movie.

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,160
The interview.
I'm,

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,840
I'm going to go to the match on this 
one.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
I'm looking at it right now.
I just spoke with it.

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,850
And you're wrong.
So Bert Kreischer is going deep and he's

25
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,770
taking chances.
Predictions.

26
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:09,540
He's challenging young Jamie on the air 
boy choice.

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,700
I think we got a little too high before 
the show.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,590
Rogue and honest with you.
We got a little ridiculous Roy Choi.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,790
I did.
I misspell it.

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,360
Roy Choi,
Joe Rogan experience with Brian Stann.

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,040
Hmm.
What?

32
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,930
No,
that's definitely not true.

33
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,700
It says,
it says Roy Choi.

34
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,610
I promise you.
Well,

35
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,400
Brian,
Stan was definitely by himself.

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,433
Can Right?
Can someone please just tweet the 

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,153
fucking answer to me cause I promised 
you I saw it and I would make these 

38
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,280
people do the work when you're not doing
this.

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,510
I'm not too far.
I'm too fucked up to do the okay.

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,000
But I promise you it was on in here one 
time.

41
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,460
I know he's wrong,
but I'm like God damn he right.

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,893
Roy Choi fucking Jamie.
The Roy Choi created the TACO truck 

43
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,560
crane.
Uh,

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,660
he's good friends with Anthony Bourdain 
and uh,

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,000
sorry,
maybe you're spelling it wrong.

46
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,230
Racist.
Whoa.

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,513
Dare you.
How dare you cast upon him a moniker 

48
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,860
that cannot be shaken.
So anyway,

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,793
damn,
I don't even know where if I was going 

50
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:13,110
with his point wines.
It's getting hot in here.

51
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,880
All sorts of different types of alcohol.
We're probably out of wine,

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520
wine,
young Jamie,

53
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,613
Jamie's gonna find out.
But I don't know where my point with 

54
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,510
this going.
Oh he took,

55
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,230
he took me and my wife to uh,
he took me and my wife to um,

56
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,973
uh,
to Korea town to go eat Korean barbecue 

57
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,990
cause he wanted to teach us real Korean 
barbecue,

58
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,060
like what they eat,
not the kind that we believe it is.

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,560
Right.
And it was interesting.

60
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,830
We went in there and no one's spoken,
no one,

61
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,520
there were not only were there any white
people,

62
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,383
no one spoke English at work there.
And so we actually were complete and 

63
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:46,440
total tourists in our own town and just 
sat and watched him order and,

64
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,210
and he just was like,
don't worry,

65
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,044
I'll,
and it was really fascinating 

66
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,530
experience.
Would I want that place to ever go away?

67
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,483
Never in a million fucking years.
I want those places to last as long as 

68
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,434
son of a bitch.
Champagne motherfucker brought out 

69
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,540
champagne.
Damn.

70
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,453
Isn't it?
Is this cause you're wrong and Ma Fucka 

71
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,030
a birthday.
Uh,

72
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,660
but uh,
but like I believe in that.

73
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,430
I know,
but I I,

74
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,263
but then again,
we're on the same liberal side of the 

75
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,150
fence because I am a,
I've,

76
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,820
maybe I'm a libertarian or whatever.
I am.

77
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,983
I'm a liberal.
I'm a conservative liberal or 

78
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,570
conservative.
Liberal.

79
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,760
Yeah.
What do you liberal about?

80
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,740
Like gay rights,
gay rights,

81
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,210
all rights,
all human rights,

82
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,450
all female gay rights,
transgender or you name it.

83
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't want you to feel like shit.
If I can help that,

84
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,580
that's my job as a comic.
My only goal is to make people laugh.

85
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,400
Why would I ever want anyone to feel bad
about their day?

86
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,890
That's not my emo.
Beautiful.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,030
And what do you conservative about?
Um,

88
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,990
like blacks?

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,113
No,

90
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,490
no,
the right to tell that joke to you.

91
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,020
Yes.
Good.

92
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,700
That's what I'm conservative about.
Is that conservative anymore?

93
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,620
Yes,
it is because it's still conservative.

94
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,523
Is Conservative value to be able to 
express yourself in a way that it'd be 

95
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:03,110
offensive.
Did you see that the recent ruling,

96
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,060
young Jamie pulled this up?
It's kind of interesting.

97
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,520
The court ruled against this idea that 
uh,

98
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,910
there should be laws against,
what can I calm down?

99
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:16,340
Brighton.
I'm about to release the crackin.

100
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,100
He's going to open this cork and Brian 
is terrified.

101
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,423
Like he's never been to the gun range.
I had one of those hit me in the eye 

102
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,330
before.
Oh,

103
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,220
there you are partying with the wrong 
people.

104
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:33,221
Sign it into that wine and make a fine 
rosie Zinfandel or some shit.

105
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,080
A wine cooler.
A bit.

106
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,790
That's like a watermelon lime cooler.
Barlow,

107
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,450
James Bartles and jaymes strawberry,
right?

108
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,220
Strawberry.
I'm not drinking.

109
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,010
Double it up.
Mother drink during the day.

110
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:48,780
It doesn't take one of the gin.
Hey,

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,090
whoa,
listen.

112
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,193
Okay.
What I'm going to hammered right now 

113
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,550
that we're all hammered.
We're all stone too.

114
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,963
You just said you went to take it on the
Chin after giving a story about a man 

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,170
massaging somebody that I'm really like 
down in the Internet,

116
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,440
not backing me up with his roy toy thing
and I started right.

117
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,970
It looks like,
but I'm pretty sure he's right.

118
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,013
He's not right,

119
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,103
right.
Almost all the time.

120
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,670
Is that racist?
Is Not Racist.

121
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,103
It's just a gong.
Can we get away with a Gong for anybody 

122
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:21,480
gets mad?
David Cho or that you're thinking of?

123
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,700
No,
it's Roy Choi.

124
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,480
I want to fucking call him.
God has no nothing.

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,180
It's a void choice.
Sorry,

126
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:30,160
sorry.
Sorry.

127
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:30,994
Sorry.
I'm looking at all the Eddie Wong 

128
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,380
episodes when he was in here.
He wasn't in here sweetie.

129
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,180
It's okay.
Jamie.

130
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,613
I'm sorry.
I mean this is the only place I've 

131
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:41,010
worked here.
I was in this building and I pretty much

132
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:44,310
remember every single one.
It would have to be super old school,

133
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,080
like to the point where I don't remember
it anymore.

134
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,973
Last time you were on the show,
we drove home together or the time 

135
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,184
before and you talked about your friend.
So it must have been within the last 

136
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,730
three months then I would,
I only know this cause he's done the,

137
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,050
he's been done for Dane tumor,
something going on here.

138
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,640
He's telling me here,
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,980
Yeah,
I hydrated.

140
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,650
He,
I've,

141
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,040
he's done bourdain show and he's done 
your podcast and he'd do neither for me.

142
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,530
So I remember going like,
like a per day and I get it.

143
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,520
Why wouldn't you go on with Bourdain?
One of the greatest people on television

144
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,130
for chefs,
but I was like podcast wise,

145
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,870
like I was like,
I was like,

146
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:20,390
and I get why you do joe,
but like throw me a bone Roy.

147
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,040
Like we were,
he's a good guy.

148
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,810
He's a great guy.
But his,

149
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,644
uh,
um,

150
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,623
no,
I don't want to get removed from the 

151
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,700
podcast.
Eddie Wong and Shane Smith.

152
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,530
I guarantee let's,
maybe you hold on.

153
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:30,871
No,
no,

154
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:31,131
no,
no.

155
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:31,964
Go to the video.
Go to the video and see if there's 

156
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,550
another Asian guy.
Was there another Asian guy in here with

157
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,620
them?
Their lunch time there was,

158
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:40,350
there was a,
it was the dude from a party.

159
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,510
He was from that show.
The show off.

160
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,383
Was it?

161
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,180
What was it?
Off the boat.

162
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,700
Fresh off the boat I was spending,
now I know what I'm doing tonight.

163
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,870
It's no big deal,
dude.

164
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,950
He can be wrong.
I think you're wrong.

165
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,803
Attach your whole life to this.
It's just too hard to win and every 

166
00:06:58,971 --> 00:06:59,804
phone life to let some certain losses,
they're going to come your way and 

167
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,190
you've got to regroup and you've got to 
pick up the paces,

168
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,930
paces,
paces,

169
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,373
pick up the pieces and move on with your
life for Christ or bigger fan of your 

170
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:16,040
podcast and you are of your podcasts.
I watch all of them.

171
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,870
Sharon,
how could you ever say that?

172
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,090
That Joe Rogan's,
he's not saying anything either.

173
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,210
So David Choe found it.
I don't even think anybody named Roy has

174
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:25,100
been on the podcast.
Came on with David Show.

175
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,600
Yup,
he did.

176
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,960
He's right here.
David was been on a few times,

177
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,600
maybe came to one of the ice house 
chronicles.

178
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,680
Was it a nice house?
Chronical?

179
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,240
Nope.
I'm going through,

180
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,060
this was David's show.
I did David show once.

181
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,900
That's it.
It was five 92 with David.

182
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,930
She was the one episode I wasn't here.
Oh Shit.

183
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,883
Could have been the one episode,
but Jamie was on five 63 that can't be 

184
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,431
that dumb,
dumb,

185
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,300
dumb,
dumb.

186
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,310
What gave it shows podcasts that when 
Joe Rogan was on that podcast could have

187
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,600
been.
I think that's,

188
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,460
it makes more sense.
Number five 92 I have a,

189
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,480
this is horrible podcasting and no,
it's not.

190
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,020
I have a hard time believing when we've 
actually done 750 podcasts.

191
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,050
I was all five 90 27697006969 bro.
You've done 769 podcasts.

192
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,790
Indeed preposterous.
It's great man.

193
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,803
I like what you did and I don't know,
I think I may have told you this one 

194
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,060
thing fucked up.
I'm,

195
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,550
I'm very,
uh,

196
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,630
I'm envious in a sense of what you've 
done and only,

197
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,830
I only had that I could not do it.
Begin it now.

198
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,113
What you did is you kind of took,
you kind of took the renaissance to 

199
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:34,934
yourself and you allowed people that 
think differently than you to come to 

200
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:41,180
you and talk to you and you got to kind 
of soak in the information like a sponge

201
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,260
as a stand up man.

202
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,450
That is like,
that's the fucking,

203
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,284
that's what we all should be doing.
Instead of just sitting around and 

204
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:47,864
going,
what does this guy think about 

205
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,090
airplanes?
What is it?

206
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:50,924
You know what I mean?
You really kind of broadened the 

207
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,740
spectrum of what you want to talk about 
on stage.

208
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,790
And I remember hearing Chris rock say 
that he got invited to Cornell Wallace's

209
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:00,714
house for Sunday dinners and right 
before he did his most monumental hour 

210
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,651
and he was like,
you know,

211
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:05,910
it was really cool.
I didn't say anything.

212
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:06,744
I just would sit and listen to all these
great Glenn Wallace or West Cornell 

213
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,883
West,
my dad,

214
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,273
Hey Bert Roy troy was an episode of 
getting Doug with high with Horatio's 

215
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,940
sands.
Uh,

216
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,710
Kuroshio and me have often been 
confused.

217
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,760
There's no way I might think of Doug 
with the high.

218
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,440
Yes,
yes you are.

219
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,333
Oh,
are you serious?

220
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,320
Yo,
it happens.

221
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,250
Let it go.
Just embrace the loss.

222
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:39,180
Take it on the Chin and move forward.
Soldier on,

223
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,640
sir.
It's no big deal.

224
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:42,930
Burt wanted minute.
Look at them.

225
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,030
Very competitive,
very competitive.

226
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,730
Getting Doug with high.
You know what?

227
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,250
You hit.
Hit debunked this.

228
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,150
Are you ready for me to debunk a 
scientist?

229
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,650
Hoping you can do it.
Here we go.

230
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,150
Mike.
Drop moment.

231
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,730
Dear scientist who spent her whole life 
figuring this out,

232
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,030
I just shut you down so I built a time 
trouble.

233
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,450
Me and Brian are time travel consists of
a bottle of champagne,

234
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,890
a lighter and a joint.
Right?

235
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,900
I'm just saying simple,
simpler time machine.

236
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,640
Yeah.
Stops or join in on this.

237
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,960
Can I handle this one on my own?
So I'm so let's play.

238
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,823
I'm just saying simple mechanics.
Let's pretend that that's the time 

239
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:20,700
machine,
right?

240
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,451
We got it.
All right.

241
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:22,460
We invent a time machine.
God,

242
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,303
Oh my God,
we right now we can travel back to that 

243
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:27,840
moment three days ago.
We can try to travel back to this moment

244
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,750
or three days to know.
I can say to Brian,

245
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,720
hey,
our time machine really just consists of

246
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,510
a bottle of champagne,
a joint and lighter.

247
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,840
Go to f,
let's fucking send you back.

248
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,410
You know the three things.
Bill one then come back to me.

249
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:44,244
Now your idea,
she gets together with my chipolte lay 

250
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,330
person.
They have sex and have a baby.

251
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:49,164
That makes no sense you guys.
There's no time machine never going to 

252
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:59,431
be built because Donald Trump is 
president and dogs living together.

253
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,080
We're a simulation program.
Time machine doesn't matter.

254
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,270
Burt's ideas back to the future.
Three basically.

255
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:10,930
Is that what it is,
Jamie?

256
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,110
Jamie shutting your shit down.
Stuck what they do to your,

257
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:19,150
you're interrupting your Kettle Bell 
Workout on a stop shutting down.

258
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,810
Oh fuck.
Okay.
