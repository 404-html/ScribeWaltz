00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,920
Record.
Hi sweeties.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,200
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the fleshlight.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,530
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,870
Is that me?
Click on the link for the flashlight and

5
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:20,340
enter in the code name,
Rogan.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,840
He's a flashlight,
flashlight,

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,950
flesh,
flesh.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,580
How dare you did?
I said,

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,090
well,
I didn't need a flashlight.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,650
I don't know.
I think I said flesh.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,360
I'm a little too few people out there.
I'm a little too high to be doing this 

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,540
commercial.
Maybe I'm too high and I heard it.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,460
Flashlight.
Look,

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,710
the fleshlight is an excellent product.
This is for real.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm going to stray off the script.
You know,

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,250
let's get everybody needs masturbation.
That shit's important is important.

17
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:50,100
It seems ridiculous.
It's very embarrassing,

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,130
but it is sexual maintenance and it's 
important and you shoot way bigger 

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,610
loads,
in my opinion with the flashlight,

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,290
that it's powerful.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,860
How?
Because your girlfriend gets mad at it.

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,950
Exactly.
Yeah.

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,980
Now I've lost at least more than one 
flashlight just vanish.

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,620
It got thrown away,
thrown away.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,170
Oh my goodness.
Fascinating.

26
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:19,110
Is that no pleasure?
Only me.

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,460
Only me.
Can.

28
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:24,240
Pleasure.
Not even like a fake part of a person.

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,710
I think I pattern,
but I think it's more that she's 

30
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:35,561
embarrassed that I've got a can with an 
asshole poking at it.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,190
Listen,
this is the beginning of the show.

32
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,180
Hit the button pitches.
Duncan trussell's here.

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,300
We've already had a podcast and a half 
before we even got started and we might 

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,800
be too high to talk in public.
Just give it a fucking country.

35
00:01:59,330 --> 00:01:59,460
No,

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,450
the country Tryezz,
but God damn.

37
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:05,260
I wish I had it in me.
I wish I had some country work ethic,

38
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,720
con stance or something.
You know,

39
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,160
country workout.
Fuck you.

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,820
People talk about a guy that's got a 
country work ethic automatically.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
You'll you,
you know,

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,250
you mean a man.
Want to admire them?

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,890
Yeah.
Awesome dude.

44
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,480
He could just shut his fucking mouth and
for some hay around.

45
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,130
That's right.
There's something about that.

46
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:22,300
That's admirable,
right?

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,500
Isn't it?
Sure.

48
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:28,501
It's amazing.
It's like some wild west type movie 

49
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:28,501
shit.
Yeah.

50
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,670
That seems like a great life guy who 
gets up early in the morning,

51
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:35,530
just fucking milks cows till he can't 
walk anymore and the day goes to sleep.

52
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,220
Something admirable about.
Have you ever found an attorney,

53
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,580
Joe?
Yes.

54
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:42,340
I think I have on fear factor.
Pretty sure a goat one.

55
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,890
Squeeze it.
I don't know if I did it.

56
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:47,050
I might be imagining this was so long 
ago.

57
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,720
Um,
we had people suck on goat tits.

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,910
They had actually suck on it.
It was very phallic.

59
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:56,911
It was really weird to watch like girls 
sucking on this tit like sucking milk 

60
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,540
off.
This looks like a black deck.

61
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,160
It looks like a deformed,

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
like a short fat black Dick and these 
girls and these girls were suck at all 

63
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,520
of these things.
Pulling milk out of guys were to,

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,450
you know,
it was,

65
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,410
it was.
Wow.

66
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,420
That goat is experiencing what is 
essentially a ufo abduction.

67
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,690
It's mind cannot process what's 
happening.

68
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,830
Whereas they're used to getting milked 
apparently because they milk them every 

69
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:24,830
day.
You know,

70
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,750
they squeeze on them.
Yeah.

71
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:30,751
But if you imagine having just like 
fading on you and you don't know what 

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,120
they're doing.
So demonic,

73
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:34,990
right?
Yeah.

74
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,670
Trapped in a cage,
right.

75
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,940
Attached by color.
I think there were attached by a chain 

76
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,010
trying to make sense on.
I mean they must in some way be trying 

77
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,010
to process what's happening.
Oh,

78
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,850
and you know what?
They were elevated as well.

79
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:53,851
How weird was that?
They were up on the platform so that 

80
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:53,851
people could get out of them with their 
mouth.

81
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,870
They didn't have to go under him.
If I'm pretty sure,

82
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,560
if I remember that correctly,
I might be imagining that as well,

83
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,620
but I remember.
Imagine I remember being there thinking 

84
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,120
how bizarre it was.
Just people are sucking on these animal 

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,270
parts on TV,
you know?

86
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,470
It feels real.
If you ever feel cow one.

87
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,920
I just wonder if there's a lot of 
farmers,

88
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,720
but it feels real like it feels like 
you're holding something.

89
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,630
That's the only thing that you've ever 
felt like that before is your Dick.

90
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,560
So it feels like it just feels like a.
it's like a flashlight for men.

91
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,760
When you mean a delta.
Yeah.

92
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,310
This fucking strains that we drink the 
milk out of other animals.

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,311
So we make them make milk and then we 
drank it and we sell it and it's super 

94
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,460
common milk.
Totally normal.

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,580
Yeah.
It's like we're parasites or cow 

96
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,440
parasite.
We extract some,

97
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,580
some they're fluid and we sell it and we
add weird shit till we put chocolate in 

98
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:52,071
it,
but apparently a lot of people believe 

99
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:54,261
that eating dairy is not healthy for the
human body and that you'll feel better.

100
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:59,070
Your energy levels will be better if you
just cut dairy out of your life.

101
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:02,400
I've heard that from so many people.
There's no way it can't be true,

102
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,810
but milk is delicious and so as ice 
cream and you can go fuck yourself.

103
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:08,040
I liked cheese,
you know,

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,970
I'm not cutting dairy out.
I just went to a.

105
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:16,070
I just went to Paris and she got super 
stoned.

106
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,220
And how'd you get stoned in Paris?
I'll talk about it after the podcast.

107
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,720
You don't want to mention on the 
podcast?

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,650
No.
Good move.

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,860
Good move.
Yeah,

110
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,970
just a friend out in Paris.
Wow.

111
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,030
That's lucky break.
But uh,

112
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,180
but weed is illegal and parents,
how illegal is it?

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I don't know.
I was standing next to someone openly 

114
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,320
smoking hash in the subway.
So really?

115
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,070
Yeah.
So I don't know how illegal.

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,310
I don't think anyone.
I don't know.

117
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,350
I have no idea,
but I hadn't eaten there yet and I was 

118
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:47,591
super stoned and it was the first time 
I'd ever eaten like French cheese and I 

119
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,980
almost passed out because it tasted so 
good.

120
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,130
I swear to God I got a momentary vertigo
or it's like I've been eating prison 

121
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,700
cafeteria food for my entire life 
because the food over there is better.

122
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,570
Food in Paris is better.
It comes straight from the countryside 

123
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:07,570
right now though.

124
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,090
Hundreds and thousands of dudes tweeting
for all over the country going,

125
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,350
why don't you fucking move?

126
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,870
I would if I could really.
I've always thought they had the worst 

127
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,420
food until he.
He said this because I always.

128
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,360
I worked at a French restaurant once and
it was the worst food ever.

129
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:26,361
Like the lobster bisque or something 
like that was the only thing that I 

130
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:26,361
thought was decent on the whole menu.

131
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,100
What is it like a low end restaurant or 
was it a nice place?

132
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,190
French place?
Yeah.

133
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,820
Yeah.
I don't know.

134
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,970
I'm not really familiar.
I'm not as much as much of a food 

135
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,530
efficient auto that I could tell you 
what French food really is.

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,660
I know there's a place down the street 
from here I really liked.

137
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,000
That's supposedly French because they 
have fog law.

138
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,620
That's the French way of saying,
right,

139
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,520
this duck liver,
it's delicious.

140
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,090
It's one of the rude as fuck they.
They were the mouth.

141
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,390
Fuck this.
Poor goose.

142
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,060
It's terrible.
I mean their mouth.

143
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:56,430
Fuck this goose and force feed them.
It's kind of crazy.

144
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,160
It's a.
it's a horrible,

145
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,480
horrible thing.
What is it?

146
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,380
Their liver?
No,

147
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,410
it's their liver mixed in with the shit 
base spray into them and it like 

148
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,130
flavors.
That's what it is,

149
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:12,131
right?
It flavors the liver so that it tastes 

150
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:12,131
really good,
but it's so good.

151
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,760
Here's the weird thing.
That's the guy.

152
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:18,761
I think this is going to piss everybody 
off if they're not already mad about me 

153
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:19,760
saying French fruit's better,
but it is better.

154
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,940
Like it's defined better.
Like what?

155
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,870
What makes it better?

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,150
They just use more butters that it's 
more like I don't give no,

157
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,310
but I mean in France,
I've got to imagine it's it just on 

158
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,750
another level of like it's more,
it's more intense.

159
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,780
It's like.
I'm trying to think of a great way to 

160
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,510
explain it.
It's like the volume is turned up a 

161
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,510
little bit more on it.
It's flavor wise.

162
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,660
The flavor's better.
It's just,

163
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,970
it's like they like the way they cook 
it.

164
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:49,550
The place that we went to,
they were cooking.

165
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,670
We ordered this rib platter for two and 
they cook this giant slab of meat on an 

166
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:58,820
open fire,
like above a fireplace and you can watch

167
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:03,821
it in the restaurant and the restaurant 
feels like something out of the 16 

168
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,530
hundreds or something.
Do you know why it feels like that?

169
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,020
Because it's been around since the 16 
hundreds.

170
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,810
Like everything.
There's old,

171
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,650
old,
old,

172
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:17,651
old,
so it's like you're in this place where 

173
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,111
so many human lives have happened and 
I'm not saying that's why the food 

174
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:20,111
tastes better,
but it's your insurance.

175
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,590
It's so good,
man.

176
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:22,860
It was really good.

177
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,210
Or kind of make a word one.
One thing that I never appreciated,

178
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:31,211
I think before watch sort of watching 
that no reservations show was that that 

179
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,550
food for the preparation of food is 
really an art form.

180
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,320
It really,
truly is an art form.

181
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,560
I mean I kind of knew that abstractly 
and I always like appreciated good 

182
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,080
chefs,
but until I watched that show not,

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
you see that guy's passion,
how he describes food,

184
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,500
how um,
how uh,

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,010
how addictive it is.
You know,

186
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,630
what's the word I'm looking for?
Not Addictive.

187
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,320
It's like,
it's,

188
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,010
it's,
it's,

189
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,670
it just gets you hungry like it,
it starts like the way he describes 

190
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,351
things,
like I never get more hungry than when 

191
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:07,851
I'm watching that shit.
It's like you realize that people are 

192
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:08,610
really bad ass chefs.
All these guys,

193
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,820
they're all like,
they all have ideas and thoughts and 

194
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,110
like a,
a method to how they prepare things and,

195
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,320
and it's,
it's so fascinating that it's just to 

196
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,721
maximize the impact that it has on the 
pallet and it's just strange art form 

197
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:28,551
the art form of flavor.
And I never really appreciated that 

198
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,150
until I watched that show.
And then when then you what you see like

199
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,820
a really well prepared dish and you're 
like,

200
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,850
wow,
that guy just fucked me up with some 

201
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,220
crazy crab with squid ink pasta.
And you realize that like these 

202
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,560
creations of textures and combinations 
of flavors,

203
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,670
it really is a bad ass art form.
I never appreciated it before.

204
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,460
Yeah,
yeah.

205
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:51,100
And you get this when you taste 
something really good like that,

206
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,200
you get a glimpse at how there's like 
this spectrum of sense gratification and

207
00:09:56,201 --> 00:10:01,201
some people in some parts of the world 
and figured out ways to hit the higher 

208
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:06,181
ends up.
So if you're only experiencing life at 

209
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:09,511
this one spectrum of it,
then when you do get something super 

210
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,870
high end like that,
it's really intense.

211
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:15,871
It's just uh,
it's amazing to think people eat like 

212
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:18,571
that every day.
And also the weird thing about a lot of 

213
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:21,361
people in Paris,
they fucking eat so much and they eat 

214
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:24,751
all day long.
It seems like everything there is about 

215
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:24,751
eating or going out to eat with your 
friends.

216
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:29,050
And it's this very serious ritual.
Like when you go to a restaurant,

217
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,620
it has the same energy of like you feel 
like you're in an air traffic control 

218
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:34,620
tower.

219
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,270
People are eating in the serious way.
It's like a,

220
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,690
like they're taking in an art or 
listening to a symphony and some of 

221
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:42,690
these restaurants,
not all of them,

222
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,310
but some of them it's intense and 
there's like four waiters,

223
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,490
they're dressed like super formally.
There's kids being trained since they 

224
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,740
were like 15 to be waiters and so it's 
this cultural,

225
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,580
it's embedded into their culture and 
they've really refined it and it's 

226
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,850
really fucking cool,
but French people that are the ones that

227
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,030
you don't see fat people there,
they're eating all the fucking time,

228
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,120
but most of them are thin.
Most of them seem like they're in shape.

229
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:09,220
It's really weird.
How do they do that?

230
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,530
People say because there's no 
preservatives in the food they eat,

231
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,530
like food that comes straight from the 
countryside.

232
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,700
That's what people say.
I mean,

233
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,120
I'd heard all this stuff by the way I'd 
heard it before I went.

234
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,230
I read it.
The food,

235
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:25,231
there's better.
People are like thin people are living 

236
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:26,470
life and I was extremely skeptical,
link,

237
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,750
whatever.
It's that Buddhist quote,

238
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:33,751
I think I've said it on here.
Some people will tell you this place is 

239
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:36,781
better than that place.
This country is better than this 

240
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:36,910
country.
There's smarter people here than there,

241
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,660
but I say to you,
the whole world is on fire.

242
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Everywhere you go.
People are consumed with the same fears 

243
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,901
and worries and it's all the same.
The Buddha did not eat ribs and fucking 

244
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:53,971
Paris because that place is different.
It's fucking nice man.

245
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,510
For subway signs.
They all look like the lettering,

246
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,350
the font.
They use an absence bottles like,

247
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,880
yeah,
it's fucking trippy and cool.

248
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:06,260
And I'll,
I'll shut up about Paris because I might

249
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:07,960
sound like an Asshole,
but we,

250
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,510
uh,
you know about the catacombs of Paris.

251
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,580
No,
you were describing this to me.

252
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,460
This is the most scariest Shit I've ever
seen in my life that did it.

253
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,590
I did not know existed.
And there's more than one.

254
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,860
I've soft photos once of a church,
but just explain to everybody what it 

255
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:22,860
is.

256
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,990
So underneath Paris basically,
and I don't know the exact history 

257
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,891
behind this,
but what happened is I think because of 

258
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,680
the black plague,
everyone starts dying.

259
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,530
They're having these mass die offs and 
they were.

260
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,620
They ran out of room and the cemeteries.
So they had to dig up all the bones from

261
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:44,991
the cemetery surrounding Paris and they 
took them under Paris into these 

262
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:48,450
limestone quarries and created these 
things called Ossuarys,

263
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:53,451
which are these open air crips and 
someone has gone and basically.

264
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:58,521
So to get there,
you go down these winding steps that go 

265
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:02,361
down and down and down and down and down
and down and down and down and down and 

266
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:07,080
down to a point where you start feeling 
like you're going crazy because you just

267
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:12,081
keep seeing more steps and more steps 
and more steps and more steps in your 

268
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,310
mind.
Starts saying you are going deep,

269
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,420
deep underground.

270
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,450
Like we're talking like out of breath on
the stairmaster steps like way down to 

271
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:25,941
the quarries under the city and you sort
of walk around and then suddenly you 

272
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:30,861
come out and do hallways of bones.
Just yellowed old French bonds that 

273
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:37,731
someone is stacked into a patterns like 
crucifixes and it looks like the Texas 

274
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:43,851
chainsaw massacre house when you went in
the movie where they have bone 

275
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:44,490
sculptures everywhere.
It's like that.

276
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:49,491
They've just.
Someone just took like a shitload of 

277
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:52,641
femurs and it's like,
I think I could make a crucifix out of 

278
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:53,010
this and like.
So there's a cross in the middle.

279
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:58,011
There's stacks of skulls.
They say there's 9 million skeletons 

280
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:00,540
down there,
9 million.

281
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,690
So 9 million lives are completely 
anonymous now.

282
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,640
No one knows who the fuck they are.
All you see is just,

283
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,880
there's no names,
there's not a wall listing who's down 

284
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,880
there.

285
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,240
It's just row upon row upon row of 
skulls and skulls and I swear to God,

286
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,160
it's got to be the worst job on the 
planet.

287
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:25,161
I pass this French kid whose job is to 
sit in a lawn chair down there and 

288
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,540
observed people to make sure they don't 
steal bones.

289
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,930
And I walked by the kid and he was like 
hail and sick because it's damp down 

290
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:36,000
there and it kinda sounded like he was 
talking to himself and French.

291
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,570
He kind of seemed out of his mind.
He just sits in bones all day.

292
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,610
Best place to rape ever though,
right?

293
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,620
If you're going to rape and murder 
somebody,

294
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,420
take them down there.
That'd be perfect.

295
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:46,290
Well,
it gets weirder,

296
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,620
so as it turns out under Paris,
the catacombs at the are in.

297
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,830
That's only a fraction of the catacombs.
There is miles and miles and miles of 

298
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:02,561
wining catacombs.
One of our waiters told us that people 

299
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:05,360
go down there and they get lost and they
find them down there and they've starved

300
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:09,410
to death in the and catacombs fucking 
die.

301
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,990
Crazy.
Last.

302
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,150
You go down there and the dark,
the flashlight runs out.

303
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:18,500
No one's coming down there and you're 
fucking so much.

304
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,410
Gets even weirder.
These fucking French police.

305
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:26,411
It's on the Internet and I'm just 
freaking out and thinking about dying 

306
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:30,611
that way.
Could you imagine your fucking slash 

307
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:33,691
light goes out and it's so far down like
it's like a basement of earth that just 

308
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:37,790
that last moment and then nothing.
Blackness.

309
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,340
You start,
you would start hearing,

310
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,200
start hearing things,
start seeing things.

311
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,110
You probably don't send people down 
there looking for folks.

312
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,100
No,
not some.

313
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,370
Not some French mime who got depressed 
and decided he was going to go down and 

314
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,031
take a break in the category.
So is it open to anyone yet that the 

315
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,430
Parisian teenagers have their own 
entrances and they bring turntables and 

316
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,590
speakers down there and have dance 
parties?

317
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,590
Oh my God.

318
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,680
So fucking cool.
We want to go down there and take 

319
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Iowasca with you,
Joe.

320
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,311
So we're not going to say,
could you imagine what a terrific 

321
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,340
combination that would you adopt,
right?

322
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:18,910
Yeah.

323
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,560
Well you would definitely never be seen 
again,

324
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,710
right?
You would probably just be absorbed with

325
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:29,711
the energy of what it must have been 
like to see millions of people just 

326
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:33,461
right in front of you by some incurable 
disease that was inescapable and you had

327
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:36,540
just had a hope that some of the 
genetics would carry on it.

328
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,620
Some people would be able to live 
through this shit.

329
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,720
If you ever get serious about your life,
that is a.

330
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,290
A cure is the c nine millions goals to 
Emr.

331
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,380
Come on,
man.

332
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,910
Does it really make you less serious 
about your life?

333
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,230
It just,
you know,

334
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,940
it just lets you know.
Yeah,

335
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,430
it lets you know that there's,
we're,

336
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,800
we're very fortunate that shit's going 
this way.

337
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,840
We're very fortunate.
We were born in 2000.

338
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,990
We're alive in 2011.
We're very fortunate.

339
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,690
You know,
just a little while ago,

340
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,700
stuff was terrible.
You know,

341
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,710
I joke around about being on stage,
like when we were in Philly and I was 

342
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,341
going,
do you know why the streets are so 

343
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:16,781
narrow around here?
Because there were made by people 

344
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,350
writing fucking horses.
Like wrap your head around that.

345
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,780
This city was designed by people who 
thought,

346
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,000
well,
we just need a place to put the horses.

347
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,490
This is where the horses are going to 
run.

348
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,010
Like everybody got around it.
I'll fucking city on horses.

349
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,640
Well there's that.
You know,

350
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,090
there,
there's this thing I just read about 

351
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,090
this,
a famous,

352
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,020
I think he was an obstetrician and he 
died in a mental asylum.

353
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,940
It was unready.
He died in a mental asylum.

354
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,010
This is way back.
I don't know the exact time,

355
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:44,130
but it was when they still believed in 
the humors of the body,

356
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,230
their idea of the way the body worked 
was based on,

357
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,410
you know,
bloodletting and they didn't know they 

358
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:51,410
thought

359
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,980
they were.
They didn't know that flies came from 

360
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,591
fly eggs.
They thought there was something called 

361
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:58,020
spontaneous generation where if you had 
the right elements in one place,

362
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,630
it would produce a fly.
He,

363
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:05,631
they didn't know there were eggs.
So they had these really fascinating 

364
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,780
ways of understanding the universe.
What year was this?

365
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,900
I don't know the exact year.
If you look up spontaneous generation,

366
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,150
it'll pop up the year that they believed
this.

367
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,230
But,
um,

368
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,580
there was a obstetrician who suddenly 
came up with this crazy idea.

369
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,040
He thought that if doctors wash their 
hands between handling,

370
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,480
like doing an autopsy or handling a dead
body and delivering a baby,

371
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,080
then maybe the mothers wouldn't die as 
much as they were dying of this 

372
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,880
infection called fluorosis.
So he's like,

373
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,070
we should start maybe washing her hands 
guys,

374
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:46,071
after you handle the a rotting corpse 
and then put your hand in that lady's 

375
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:46,071
Pussy.

376
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:50,820
Why don't you wash your hands and um,
doctors were like,

377
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,330
you're a fucking lunatic.
You think washing,

378
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,450
you think if we wash our hands after we 
handle a corpse and touch a woman's 

379
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,960
open,
open dilated pussy that it's going to 

380
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:02,960
keep her from getting the infections 
they've been getting.

381
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,960
A gentleman's hands are always clean.
That's what the doctor said.

382
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,730
No joke.
So this guy,

383
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,610
I tried all these experiments and he 
like,

384
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:16,611
he dropped the death rate and one of 
these like wards where women are giving 

385
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:20,151
birth to one percent where it was 30 
percent and other places and he kept 

386
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,030
talking.
You've got to wash your hands.

387
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:24,270
You wash it with this kind of chemical 
mix and the people won't die.

388
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:26,730
You should wash your hands,
germs are getting into people.

389
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,560
But they didn't.
I don't think they knew what germs were.

390
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,160
Anyway,
the guy died,

391
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,340
I think it was.
We didn't think it was germs.

392
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,240
Just poison

393
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,620
with evil,
which was.

394
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,860
I don't know the explanation,
but it's really interesting because you 

395
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:41,860
could,
it's kind of logical.

396
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,700
You could see why they would think that,
but they couldn't accept the idea that 

397
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,180
there was microscopic things floating 
around,

398
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:50,390
like even though I guess you could see 
them in a microscope for some reason,

399
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:53,030
they really wanted to deny this in the 
same way.

400
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:58,031
Now when you talk about the idea that 
there might be an extra dimensional 

401
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,601
aliens,
there are interdimensional beings that 

402
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:01,601
you're seeing through the lens of a 
psychedelic.

403
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:05,720
You tell that to anyone or most people 
in there like you are fucking crazy.

404
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,490
You new age.
Fucking read it.

405
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Anyway,
so the point is the guy died in an 

406
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:12,940
insane asylum for suggesting people 
washing,

407
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,530
wash their hands.
That's how dirty everything was back 

408
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,991
then.
That's how it effected everything was 

409
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:23,040
done in insane.
This guy out of his mind and as you 

410
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,040
know,
towards the end of his life,

411
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,951
they said he got dementia,
but I think it was just because he knew 

412
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:30,370
that he had discovered this thing,
that he proved he could save so many 

413
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,100
lives and no one will listen to UNC.

414
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,530
Could you imagine,
dude,

415
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,800
if you were an advanced human and you 
were stuck in an advanced age that just 

416
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:43,171
refused to change,
could you imagine if you were a 

417
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:45,871
scientist from 2011 and then all of a 
sudden you found yourself in the middle 

418
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,500
of the Spanish inquisition?
You were.

419
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,710
Everyone was ridiculous and people were 
just killing people and it was just 

420
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,280
insanity.
He couldn't talk to anybody.

421
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:59,281
Just religious fanaticism completely out
of control and murder and all kinds of 

422
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:00,850
crazy shit was going on.
Could you imagine?

423
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,050
Yeah.
That was your reality.

424
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:02,590
All of a sudden,

425
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,910
religious fanaticism,
violent wars raging everywhere.

426
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,100
Talla,
Tarian,

427
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,290
presidents,
corporations running everything.

428
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,940
This Michele Bachmann lady won the Iowa 
Straw poll.

429
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,230
Yeah.
What the fuck is that?

430
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,950
He's a fucking dominatrix public and 
boys like to get spanked.

431
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,100
We are living in fascinating times.
It's when it's ripples like this,

432
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,870
like when you hear things like this to 
me,

433
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:36,530
they look like little little ripples on 
your universe,

434
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:38,840
like wake up,
pay attention.

435
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,060
There's a lot more dumb people that you 
think,

436
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,140
oh,
more painfully stupid people in this 

437
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,010
country.
A lot of them,

438
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,640
tons of them,
they can't see that she's dumb because 

439
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,310
they're way dumber than her.
They're way dumber than her.

440
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:56,690
They have no idea.
She's dumb.

441
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,720
They think she's got a good message and 
they they.

442
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,840
They don't mind her crazy eyes.
They don't see the crazy eyes.

443
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,670
They don't see the gay husband.
They don't see him.

444
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
He seems like a Nice Fella.
He's praying,

445
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:07,270
yeah,

446
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,830
gay away.
Grave.

447
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,850
The gay away we'll go.
We'll go to bunch of them and hold them 

448
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:18,160
hands.
We're going to pray in their underwear,

449
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,780
were hugging each other,
shooting loads in their pants.

450
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,180
This is a ridiculous institution.

451
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,610
You have to learn how to shoot a load in
front of men without wanting men.

452
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,550
What is it so hard for people to accept 
that people are gay?

453
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:37,360
What do you give a fuck?
They're gay.

454
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,870
So what?
Let them enjoy it.

455
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,370
What do you.
What if it doesn't affect you?

456
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:43,630
As long as they're not trying to fuck 
you.

457
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,360
Who cares what?
I don't get it.

458
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,720
It doesn't make any sense.
You're going to pray it away where 

459
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,200
you're going.
The gangway prelude,

460
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,790
but you gotta see gotTa.
You gotta understand that relationship 

461
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,510
because I think about this relationship 
between Michelle Bachmann and her 

462
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,020
husband who was clearly gay,
clearly runs what is.

463
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,730
He's running a.
that's a sex dungeon,

464
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,020
Brian.
That data

465
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,380
brian impression is really not that far 
off.

466
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,280
Know he's so unbelievably gay stuff.

467
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,550
Seems Gay.
Hey,

468
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,600
say Scott,
I don't know that he's gay for sure,

469
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:22,601
but it might not be productive.
You know that he's running a sex 

470
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,060
dungeon,
a sex dungeon,

471
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,920
you know,
he is absolutely.

472
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,260
Pray away.
The Gay Clinic,

473
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,430
that's a sex dungeon.
Yeah,

474
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:29,870
for submissive.
Good gay guys.

475
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,270
Submissive.
Gay guys go in there.

476
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,090
They go and it's like a fetish.
It's a,

477
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,130
it's a,
it's like a fetish situation.

478
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,160
It's like these get married,
gay guys go into this place where an 

479
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:48,551
expert says that he's going to use 
religion to help them overcome being 

480
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:53,711
gay.
The expert happens to seem like super 

481
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:54,860
gay,
like super.

482
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:59,861
Like he should be on the front of his 
own float in a gay pride parade,

483
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,040
holding sparklers and feel like,
I don't know,

484
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:09,041
wearing like whether a bra or something.
That seems right,

485
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,370
but he's in a suit now and he's talking 
to you in that stereotypical voice.

486
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,870
He's saying,
we can overcome this thing.

487
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,930
James,
I need you to tell me though,

488
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,830
every gay sexual encounter that you've 
ever had.

489
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,420
You know,
that's part of it.

490
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,670
Okay.
I'll tell Ya.

491
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,650
You gotta hear it out,
Talia.

492
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:35,651
Yeah.
Once I blew 17 guys at a bare party in 

493
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:36,680
New Jersey.

494
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,550
Oh,
they alone.

495
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,640
When this is happening,
is it

496
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,670
dark?
Yeah,

497
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:41,530
it's dim.
It's dim in there.

498
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,630
There's candles of Jesus.
Candace,

499
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:48,631
I guarantee that place is covered in 
pictures of the sick erotic Jesus,

500
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,320
the six pack.
Jesus.

501
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,830
You ever seen those where Jesus has 
painted with a six pack on the Cross,

502
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,590
like a Jersey shore situation happening,
but he's getting cruised.

503
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,710
Whoa.
There's tons out there.

504
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:01,300
It's supposed to be starvation,
but we look at it as like,

505
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,600
wow,
that's like hardcore crunches.

506
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:09,601
That's not starvation,
but what happens is a lot of these 

507
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:12,241
people,
back when they were painting those 

508
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:13,861
pictures were just artists who are 
getting paid by the church and they 

509
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:15,980
needed to make money,
but they liked the male form and so they

510
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,000
were painting like they are making Jesus
hot sex.

511
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:24,001
Jesus erotic Jesus Christianity's true.
Christianity is a lot of Christianity's 

512
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,370
fucking s and and think about it.
The son of God comes down to the world 

513
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,130
and what happens?
He tells the truth and he gets spanked 

514
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,600
and a crown of thorns and whipped with 
lashes and nailed to a fucking cross and

515
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:40,930
everyone's into it like,
did you see the passion of the Christ?

516
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,300
That's an snm movie,
man.

517
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:48,301
I've been to the SNM clubs,
tie guys up to fucking crucifixes and 

518
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:51,400
whip him there all the time,
but I like black Jesus better.

519
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,210
The whole theory of them.

520
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,270
Yeah.
What is the black Jesus theory,

521
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,460
but because Jesus was supposedly 
sephardic,

522
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:57,460
wasn't it?
Isn't that.

523
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,260
Wasn't that the idea?

524
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,710
I don't know who's hotter,
who's hotter.

525
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,670
I think it's what I think it goes from 
is that everything has to start from 

526
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:06,670
black.
Not White,

527
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,490
you know,
I think it's fascinating that people 

528
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,261
want to a lay claim to something that 
people want to like that black people 

529
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,060
would go like Jesus was black,
like,

530
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,820
like it makes some handle that makes 
your life if Jesus was even real,

531
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,090
but it makes your life today in 2011.
Like you can lay claim to that.

532
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,580
Like we did that we did.
How annoying is that?

533
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,070
Like you lay,
click like Italians,

534
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,150
like hey with Allianz,
you know,

535
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,600
we built that,
we did that.

536
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,920
You know,
we did that.

537
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,740
It's not really we dude,
here's we really in this group together 

538
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:34,740
here,
black Jesus,

539
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,730
babies lack a child.
Wow,

540
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,430
let's find Jesus Dot Com.
Well hate man.

541
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,490
That's just as likely black.
Jesus is just as likely as white.

542
00:26:41,491 --> 00:26:44,160
Jesus both of were just so squirrely

543
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,290
and so you're just supposed to believe 
that the dude came back from the dead 

544
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,510
and the and that anybody would write 
that he would come back from the dead.

545
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,660
Anything else that you would read from 
them would not be equally ridiculous 

546
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,190
because we understand dad.
Now we understand that now and you're,

547
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:04,310
you're,
you're saying that we must discount at 

548
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,741
all scientific knowledge ever just 
because there's an ancient book that 

549
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:11,550
says some some stuff and if you go along
with it,

550
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,990
you have to just assume that this was a 
one time thing and that this one time,

551
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,140
these amazing,
miraculous things that defy science 

552
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,740
happened and we just have to assume that
these people who barely could write shit

553
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,810
down.
We're super accurate about it.

554
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,740
Like it's ridiculous.

555
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,490
Let's even think one step before that,
which is the religion that they've built

556
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:35,550
around this thing that based on all 
scientific evidence is possibly a myth.

557
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,350
They have their religion.
They based around this character.

558
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:46,351
Jesus is nowhere close to the things the
character said in the book that they 

559
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:50,290
read.
Jesus didn't walk around saying,

560
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,570
you need to go to church.
Here's an idea.

561
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,810
Go to build a church and every Sunday go
to the church and sit down and an 

562
00:27:58,931 --> 00:28:03,931
uncomfortable seat and read prayers 
prewritten from people that you barely 

563
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:08,101
understand and then give 10 percent of 
your income to this group of people and 

564
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:10,180
just trust that they're going to use it 
in the right way.

565
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,700
Jesus never said anything like that in 
the,

566
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,140
in the,
uh,

567
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,580
New Testament.
If you read this stuff,

568
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:20,581
mostly the idea of the thing seems to be
if you love the people around you as 

569
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:25,780
much as you can,
and if you're tuned into God or the love

570
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:27,970
force of the universe and you love that 
too,

571
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,790
then you are going to have a great life.

572
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,370
That seems to be the message.
You don't need a priest.

573
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,980
You don't need a church.
You don't need anybody.

574
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,470
You don't have to follow the rules of 
the time he was,

575
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,500
you know,
in Judaism there are very strict rules 

576
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,500
about how you're supposed to live.
And he was saying,

577
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,151
we don't have to follow these rules.
I don't have to do anything that you're 

578
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:48,151
saying.
I have my own direct connection with the

579
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:53,041
super intelligent,
super abundance of the universe and 

580
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:53,290
that's all I need,
and so then they killed them.

581
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,520
So you've got that and then what builds 
up around it?

582
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,870
Fucking Michelle Bachman,
pray away the gay,

583
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:05,871
just like Jesus want to.
Jesus didn't want somebody sticking 

584
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,870
their technical and somebody excretory,
a tube and the bid.

585
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:11,220
They.
Jesus wanted people straight.

586
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,980
Only fucking vaginas.
The creator of the universe.

587
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,800
It gives them a migraine headache to 
know on this planet.

588
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,310
People are sticking their fucking 
genitals and the other people,

589
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,620
the assholes.
That's how does that get trends?

590
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,940
How does that get translated from 
basically the first hippie?

591
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,510
Love each other.
Tune into this superintelligence.

592
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,000
It's really creepy and weird.

593
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,880
Well,
whenever you have some obscure,

594
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,010
I don't want to say obscure,
but very difficult to put

595
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,010
into modern words statement like 
whenever you read any of the any 

596
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,490
chapters of the Bible,
any,

597
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:53,670
any passages,
and he thinks that people quote all the 

598
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:53,670
time.
There's a lot of the stuff.

599
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:53,860
You'll read it and you go,
well,

600
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,350
what exactly does that mean?
Like what is,

601
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,240
you know,
trying to back up and,

602
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,310
and decipher that into modern language.
What was it originally,

603
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,270
you know,
I mean,

604
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:09,271
we know it all came from ancient Hebrew 
and then they kind of take it from 

605
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:11,170
ancient Hebrew to Latin Greek.
Like what the fuck was,

606
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,660
what would you know?
It's totally different language.

607
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,250
What was the original meaning behind it?

608
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,630
Well,
you got like,

609
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,770
but you know,
I used to,

610
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:25,771
when I was in college,
take lsd and I read the New Testament 

611
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:29,110
and it was the most awesome psychedelic 
thing ever because you're reading it and

612
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:33,790
you're thinking like this.
No matter what this is,

613
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,450
it's shaped so much of society.
These words are shaped so many people's 

614
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,570
lives.
And so just from that alone,

615
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,990
it's super psychedelic.
But what did it come from?

616
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,360
What's the original language?
What's it based on?

617
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,680
There's all these awesome ideas,
you know,

618
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,720
because there's a lot of books of the,
in the gospels that didn't make it in to

619
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:57,721
the final cut that are equally valid and
are far more esoteric and uh,

620
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,980
have like really weird ideas.
I've read stuff that it's based in like 

621
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,320
this form of religion called Gnosticism,
which I don't know too much about.

622
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,340
I've heard that it's like some weird 
desert called called these scenes or 

623
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,231
that it's somehow the formulation of all
these different desert mysticisms kind 

624
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:17,020
of merging into the,
you know,

625
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:22,021
they embodied it in the form of this 
person to transmit this bigger 

626
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:23,500
information about the idea that they're,
you know,

627
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:28,210
we're all children of some super 
intelligence and that if we give up our,

628
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,400
um,
greed and selfishness and love other 

629
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,230
people,
like we love ourselves,

630
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,240
then that would create like a,
you know,

631
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:40,750
if everyone did that,
then we would be living on this would be

632
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,530
utopia.

633
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,050
We will be in some kind of super 
communist,

634
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,080
mystical,
spiritual state where everyone's 

635
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,661
completely connected with each other.
Like imagine really feeling about 

636
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,100
everyone around you the same way you 
feel about yourself.

637
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:56,290
It means don't differentiate other 
people from your life.

638
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,290
No more differentiation.
We're all the same.

639
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,500
We're all completely connected.
We're all children of this universe and 

640
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,180
so we should treat each other love.

641
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,110
Yeah.
That doesn't work with society though,

642
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,710
unfortunately.
Like we would do,

643
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,740
they would have to be some gigantic 
event that got rid of get rid of 

644
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:21,821
currency or got rid of the idea of 
competing for currency because until p,

645
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,390
as long as people are still competing,
competing for job positions,

646
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:29,450
competing their company against other 
companies,

647
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:31,990
and as long as there's capitalism going 
on that,

648
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,070
that push for money,
that push to make money,

649
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,840
that's.
You're always going to get this same 

650
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:39,840
kind of Douchey,
cunty,

651
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,700
chimp behavior.
You know,

652
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:42,150
it's a competition.
There's a,

653
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,590
it's obvious way.
Obvious that most people are working way

654
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:50,180
harder than is both healthy and is 
desirable.

655
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,270
They're working ridiculous hours and 
pushing harder than ever because they 

656
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,180
need more money.
They want more money,

657
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:58,970
they need more money.
It's like there's a drive,

658
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:03,050
like a fucking wild machine behind it,
you know?

659
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,590
That's as long as that's there.
Fuck man.

660
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,760
How are you going to get everybody to 
just just have resources available?

661
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:14,360
You're going to trust people to work.
You're going to trust everyone to put in

662
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,340
their share.
Like all of us are going to trust all of

663
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,290
us and what do we do when someone 
doesn't.

664
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,230
Even if we're supposed to love them,
we love ourselves.

665
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,240
We just supposed to let them just fuck 
everything up all around them and let 

666
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,341
them go into super sabotaged spin out 
mode where they destroy everything in 

667
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,960
their vicinity and nobody stops him from
doing that because that's like a spoiled

668
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:33,940
child.
We've seen that

669
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,610
before.
Yeah.

670
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,590
That's the other crazy aspect of 
Christianity.

671
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:42,591
Is it ultra pacifism?
It's like super positivism and the 

672
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,510
message of the thing was supposed to be,
look,

673
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,540
this being that they're killing is the 
physical manifestation of the universe.

674
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,840
It could do a,
could fight back.

675
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,790
It could shoot lasers out of its eyes.
It's a superhero,

676
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,820
but it's letting itself.
I don't know.

677
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,890
I'm calling Jesus in net.
Whatever he is,

678
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,660
he's a wedding.
It's a wedding itself.

679
00:34:03,661 --> 00:34:06,960
Get killed to give a message,
and the message is this.

680
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:12,530
There are some things that are more 
important than life and if you want to 

681
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,680
get caught up in this dimension and you 
want to save your body,

682
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,410
you want to try to save your body,
go ahead.

683
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,480
It's going to die no matter what.
You're dead meat.

684
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,910
It's like there's no way you're going to
make it through this dimension.

685
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,670
No one,
no one makes it out alive.

686
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:27,120
Whatever Jim Morrison said,
we all know and gets out of this alive.

687
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:32,121
We all die.
So if you want to like focus and fixate 

688
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:32,370
on protecting yourself,
fine.

689
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,610
But the idea is like the,
you're supposed to completely surrender 

690
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,740
to this energy.
Right?

691
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,480
And then when in regard and once you 
really make that move,

692
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,030
which they say is an act of faith,
which I mean,

693
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,110
I,
by the way,

694
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:50,670
this is purely speculation.
I have not given my heart to Jesus,

695
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,740
but I am.
I think about,

696
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:56,310
you know,
what would happen if you did just become

697
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,930
completely everyone.
Yeah.

698
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,680
What would that be?
I mean obviously it's not possible,

699
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,180
right?
But why?

700
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,220
But why and who would make cars and how 
could there be competition?

701
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,680
How is there this,
you know,

702
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,540
how would there be any form of 
capitalism?

703
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,920
The way we have it right now,
how?

704
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,250
How would our society,
the monetary system,

705
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,170
how would it be set up the way that it 
wouldn't be?

706
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:21,520
It couldn't be.
It's impossible.

707
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,640
It's impossible

708
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,360
exists.
The church couldn't exist.

709
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,300
Society couldn't.
Yeah,

710
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,050
so how would we revamp it?
How would we,

711
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,030
how would we put it all into 
perspective?

712
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:35,031
Put it all into order.
How would we ensure that everyone 

713
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:35,460
follows along with it?
We're not.

714
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,910
Is that like a net?
Is that next stage of evolution is the 

715
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,031
next stage of evolution.
The idea that people have gotten to a 

716
00:35:44,031 --> 00:35:46,470
point technologically where we can start
to join together as one thing.

717
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,510
Again,
you know what I'm saying like that there

718
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:53,511
had to be a certain peak of competition 
to get us to a point where we have 

719
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:58,821
created some really boundary dissolving 
technology and when that point happens,

720
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,510
then through that very technology at as 
in the Internet,

721
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:08,511
people slowly start to assimilate to 
some level of understanding and 

722
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:12,930
awareness that wasn't previously 
achieved because there was this constant

723
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:17,420
state of of competition to try to get to
that

724
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,530
technological point and that's where you
run into a problem because once you 

725
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,350
start getting to that state that you're 
talking about,

726
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,350
and I think a lot of people are.
We add it right now.

727
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,720
We are right?
Yeah,

728
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,820
and that's when you get to that state 
and suddenly you're in Egypt because 

729
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,900
you're starting to understand about 
what's going on and you're you.

730
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,910
You're getting this information from the
Internet showing you what other people 

731
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,500
in other parts of the world,
how they are living.

732
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,890
The point is suddenly like a lot of shit
start seeming really like we've been 

733
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:52,921
asked to believe a lot of stuff and 
Kinda like you ask your kids to believe 

734
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,950
a lot of stuff when they're growing up 
and you do it to keep them safe.

735
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,160
You tell them these stories and you want
them to believe it,

736
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,370
but eventually your kid knows that,
you know whatever story you told him 

737
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:07,831
about where the baby came from is coming
from isn't completely real and your 

738
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:08,980
kid's going to start wanting to know the
truth.

739
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,980
And then at that age you tell your kid 
the truth and it's uncomfortable or 

740
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980
whatever.
Even tell them the truth.

741
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,730
But now it's like we still have kings.
We have kings and Queens.

742
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,790
Their king.
There's still serious kings and you're 

743
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:27,061
expecting people to keep believing this 
king is any more special than anyone 

744
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:27,061
else.
I.

745
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:31,590
Okay,
you want me to keep buying this thing 

746
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:31,590
about the king,
about how he gets to wear the throne and

747
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,761
gets to have the giant fucking a mansion
that he lives in and all this property 

748
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:38,230
lives in because he's a king and he's in
the bloodline is somewhat.

749
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:41,050
What are you talking about?
We're all the same man.

750
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,990
I got to keep playing this fucking 
masquerade party with you.

751
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,510
Unbelievable.
Yeah.

752
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,920
How much longer do I have to do this?
Because I'm hungry.

753
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,860
It's like that kind of stuff.
People are like,

754
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:52,090
okay,
okay,

755
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:53,350
so you're a president.

756
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,120
Oh I get it.
Okay.

757
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:57,610
So I guess I'm supposed to believe that 
there's a government,

758
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:01,030
which is mostly just like 120 year old 
men in a room.

759
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,660
I'm supposed to believe they're the ones
who know how to do everything and that 

760
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:06,700
system the right way and it's like all 
that stuff starts,

761
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,620
you know,
spreading or people like,

762
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,630
I don't know if I can believe the whole.
You're a cop.

763
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:13,390
I'm a person thing getting kind of hard 
for me.

764
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:18,391
I mean,
I believe it because you got a billy 

765
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:18,910
club and you're fucking beating my 
friend in a wheelchair to death,

766
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:23,020
but I'm not sure if you really represent
the real authority of the world.

767
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,200
And so that kind of stuff starts 
emerging in emerging as people evolve 

768
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,650
and the authority and the world like,
fuck,

769
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,740
I gotta believe the game.
If you don't believe it's fucking game,

770
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:35,200
where did we don't know what to do?
What are we gonna do?

771
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:37,360
We can't just reformat everything all of
a sudden.

772
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:37,630
I.

773
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,820
So do you think that law enforcement 
almost inhibits evolution by creating 

774
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:46,010
this culture where people are getting 
constantly in trouble with things?

775
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:46,550
Yeah.
Well,

776
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,920
you know what law enforcement,
a lot of law enforcement is,

777
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,340
it's delivery drivers for the prison 
industrial complex.

778
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:55,220
They deliver fucking bags of gold to the
prisons.

779
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,530
Drop them off at the door and they 
fucked.

780
00:38:57,531 --> 00:38:59,960
You make so much money.
I think we need cops.

781
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,990
We need cops.
No question about it.

782
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:05,530
Watch that.
Richard Pryor joke about like,

783
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,890
well,
we need prisons.

784
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,420
Have you ever seen that?
So funny,

785
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:13,421
but we need.
There are aspects and elements of 

786
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:14,810
society that need to be in a cage.
Yes,

787
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,520
absolutely.
But you know,

788
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,470
you don't need to be in a cage or 
smoking pie.

789
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:21,290
You don't need to be in a cage for 
taking your acid or taking mushrooms.

790
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:26,291
You don't need to be in a cage because 
you told people that the military was 

791
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:29,660
using fucking military choppers,
the gun down reporters,

792
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,370
and you had the balls to tell that to 
the world.

793
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,050
That's no reason to put someone in a 
cage.

794
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,940
So it's like it's some point as a 
certain number of people realize,

795
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,800
okay,
this is like a kid's game.

796
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:44,870
This is a game of make believe that went
way too far and I don't feel like doing 

797
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,840
this game of make believe anymore 
because it's destroying the planet.

798
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:49,940
So you got to come up with a new game 
that works,

799
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:54,941
but how are you going to convince those 
60 or 120 old fucking drooling men 

800
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:00,610
shitting their pants,
getting payoffs from the tobacco 

801
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,740
companies writing bullshit laws with our
visitation.

802
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,470
How are you going to like convince them 
like,

803
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:08,471
you know what?
What do you guys mind going home and 

804
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:12,610
we're going to get some like young 
people in here because they understand 

805
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:12,610
more.

806
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,350
Do you understand the world?
But we don't understand the economic 

807
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:18,350
system.
Yeah.

808
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,160
I'm sure some young people do lose young
people right now protesting,

809
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:20,790
listening,
saying,

810
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:21,960
I know I understand it.

811
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,310
Correct.
Look,

812
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:24,630
I know I.
I don't,

813
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,310
I don't understand it.
All I understand.

814
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:28,410
Is that video,
did you see that video I sent you today?

815
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:29,580
Did you watch that?
Fucking.

816
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,300
Oh,
it's a marine who is like,

817
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:38,301
you know,
he starts off and kind of dramatically 

818
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:39,630
rips off his is a fucking metals and 
he's like,

819
00:40:39,631 --> 00:40:44,631
I'm not gonna do it anymore,
and then he just starts going into 

820
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:46,761
graphic depictions of the different 
innocent people he killed and he was in 

821
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:51,141
Iraq and how like the marines at 
completely different when there's 

822
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:54,750
embedded with them a reporter than they 
do and how the is now.

823
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,730
Now is this real?
I didn't investigate it.

824
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:57,940
I hope it's not real.
I hope it's.

825
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,570
It seemed very real and he talked about 
how his squad commander,

826
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,810
whatever it's called,
said that they would,

827
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,860
he would congratulate them on their 
first kill and he said whichever one of 

828
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,620
you makes your first kill by stabbing 
someone to death,

829
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,450
I'm giving you four days leave and why?
It's like that kind of shit.

830
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,300
Like how are you going to convince those
guys?

831
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,930
You know,
we should all just love each other.

832
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,370
Every general.

833
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,530
How do you stop it?
You don't,

834
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,270
you can't.
There's no way to stop it.

835
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,330
There's no way to stop it unless 
somebody invents something that think 

836
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:35,330
would

837
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,110
change the world and I'd be glad to tell
you what it is.

838
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,070
What is it

839
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,780
had genetic scientist needs to figure 
out a way to put lsd and have a common 

840
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:49,010
cold so that any.
So the.

841
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,530
So the

842
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,690
psychedelic experience would spread like
a virus through society.

843
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,580
Whoa.
And then like,

844
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,370
but the problem with it is you'd have to
figure out a way to design it.

845
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,920
So it only.
The tolerance is really huge.

846
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,920
Civil a person only gets at once.
That's the problem with it.

847
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,170
Who knows?
Maybe there's a doctor.

848
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,830
The problem with it is I think there's 
several problems with that.

849
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,870
Well,
there's some other problems I suppose 

850
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:16,870
really up to you to decide whether 
people should be getting,

851
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,960
but you're trying to invent this right 
now in your house right now,

852
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,150
right?
I'm not a chemist.

853
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:22,430
I just,
I'm just throwing it out there.

854
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,870
Oh my God.
He threw it out there.

855
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,280
You really did you fuck?
Yeah.

856
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:30,281
Way To.
Somebody might be actually thinking 

857
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:30,281
about this.
I mean,

858
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:30,281
what?
So look,

859
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:30,281
here's the idea.
So.

860
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:35,021
Okay,
so let's just keep running things the 

861
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:35,021
way they're running.

862
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:35,021
No,
I don't think that's going on either,

863
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:35,860
man.
I think you're.

864
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,080
You're not happy with the pace that 
things are accelerating too.

865
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,400
I'm thinking you can genetically 
engineer it on your own or can you?

866
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,460
Maybe that's what you're there for.
Maybe the guy who does that.

867
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:49,820
That really is his purpose in the 
evolutionary chain.

868
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:55,060
He was supposed to step in and just see 
a new leap that others weren't willing 

869
00:42:55,491 --> 00:43:00,491
to take and so he dragged everyone along
and he was responsible for the next 

870
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,720
hiccup in evolution.
I just gave someone a manifesto.

871
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,840
How about that?
There's some fucking dude living in one 

872
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,510
of those loft apartments where you can 
drive your car up in an elevator and 

873
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,020
he's by himself right now.
Carving is bullied of his knife.

874
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,760
Invest in tie dye and Hendrix now.

875
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,260
Okay,
well that's an interesting fucking idea 

876
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,830
that someone could engineer a virus that
would induce a psychedelic state.

877
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,520
Yeah.
Or some kind of state.

878
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,380
I mean,
is that possible?

879
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,700
I have no idea.
I mean,

880
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,990
I,
I,

881
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,280
yeah,

882
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,220
it seems.
It seems like if it.

883
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:31,090
It can affect your body the way some 
things can.

884
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,170
Some codes can affect your body,
should be able to engineer something 

885
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:36,170
that should affect it affects you

886
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,910
something that is a byproduct.
It creates a tryptamine.

887
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,580
When you think about a man,
when you,

888
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,640
when you do Mtma and the next day you,
you sort of feel like you came down 

889
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:46,650
from,
from a cold,

890
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,700
you sort of feel like you had a cold,
so like your body was fighting something

891
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:51,040
unless

892
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,650
you use roll off.
Does that stuff work?

893
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,520
Yeah,
it does work.

894
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,780
It doesn't really work well.
It's not like he doesn't want to 

895
00:43:59,780 --> 00:43:59,780
completely bring you to a 100 percent.
I haven't,

896
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,051
I haven't done much.
Well I haven't done mdm made much or 

897
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:04,940
molly or whatever it's called a much.
But uh,

898
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:09,990
I did once without having that and then 
once with having it and it was totally 

899
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,080
big,
big,

900
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,910
big difference.
There was no hangover at all,

901
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,970
like the next day.
And it's just like you take it before 

902
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,311
you do it and then after,
right before you go to roll on and roll 

903
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:20,311
off,
it's a.

904
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:23,050
So you really didn't feel anything.
Anything funky?

905
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,210
No,
I mean I,

906
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,560
you're going to probably have a hangover
no matter what,

907
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:29,320
but I definitely felt that felt way 
better than the last time I did.

908
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,130
I hate that feeling.
So not only did that stuff

909
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,070
once because the feeling,
it was too much though.

910
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,910
That feeling was too terrible.
I just felt I was in,

911
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:43,020
I was in a coffee shop the next day and 
I bought a magazine with me sitting 

912
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,241
there drinking a cup of coffee,
trying to read this magazine I couldn't 

913
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:47,241
read,
couldn't focus,

914
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:50,450
I couldn't focus on the words.
I couldn't put my head into a paragraph,

915
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,840
couldn't do it,
and I was like,

916
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,370
oh,
this is terrible.

917
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,550
This is terrible,
terrible place for your brain to be.

918
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,030
And I went on stage and I felt that it 
was like 80 percent.

919
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,490
Even though I hit all the beats,
right.

920
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,650
I did all my material correctly.
I felt like it was only like 80 percent,

921
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:12,651
right.
Like my brain was just not capable of 

922
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:14,330
totally connecting to an,
to the material I was.

923
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,150
I was,
you know,

924
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,980
like you know how it is when you're in 
the groove,

925
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,040
when you're onstage,
you're totally connected to the 

926
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,040
material.

927
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,150
You know where the beats are,
you feel it,

928
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,610
you're in the jokes,
you know you're in there,

929
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:26,970
you're,
you're,

930
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,670
you're totally in the moment,
but sometimes not.

931
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:34,910
And then this time I just could not 
force myself into it as I was saying 

932
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:35,940
everything correctly,
but I couldn't quite keep up with it.

933
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,460
Like I was like,
this is terrible for your brain.

934
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,810
I've never had that feeling before.
It's like a feeling of like a,

935
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,770
a,
a dullness,

936
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,910
like a dying battery.
I felt awful.

937
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,860
I hate it.
It's not worth it,

938
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,320
but I did learn a lot when I did it,
man.

939
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,980
Boy,
I got a big lesson about,

940
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:56,650
about,
uh,

941
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,170
insecurity.
That's the thing that hit me the most is

942
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,110
that God,
if everybody was like,

943
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:07,350
like in some sort of a way,
the way people are during an acid trip 

944
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,910
like,
or an MDM may trip,

945
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:14,090
it's like you would,
you never would have to worry about 

946
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:14,090
fights ever again.

947
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,900
You would never have to worry about 
people being douchey to each other.

948
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,080
If somehow or another,
the brain can be engineered to operate 

949
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,140
those rpms on a regular basis.
Like as now the idea is that you take 

950
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:24,630
this Mtma,
you take ecstasy,

951
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:29,631
whatever the fuck it is and it,
it makes you high for a brief moment and

952
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:34,821
then brings you down.
But what if the mind could sustain those

953
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:39,030
levels of those chemicals on a regular 
basis?

954
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:41,580
I mean,
is that not possible?

955
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,510
Why would anyone assume we could not 
evolve to that?

956
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:50,511
If we've come to this point from some 
shit throwing know tree swinging little 

957
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,080
monkey people,
if that's what we used to be and we've 

958
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,411
come this far,
we can't take that other leap to have 

959
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:04,250
the levels of chemicals in our brains 
operate so that you would be like you 

960
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,361
were on ecstasy all the time.
That would be the way to engineer a 

961
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:11,210
loving culture because yeah,
I,

962
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:16,250
I did not feel stupid when I was on it,
which was very amazing that I could 

963
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,240
think very clearly,
but I remember thinking,

964
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:23,241
wow,
how silly is our or my insecurities and 

965
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:26,630
my silly imagine like in another 
universe where instead of building an 

966
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,130
atomic bomb,
Einstein,

967
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,100
these scientists

968
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,100
had come up with these theories in 
physics have a way to create like a,

969
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:40,780
some kind of device that blasts pure 
love and the people so that when it goes

970
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:45,781
off the city that it's in,
everyone in the city gets filled with 

971
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:48,430
like as though you are on the best 
ecstasy on the planet,

972
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,460
that level of love.
So you're at war with a country and 

973
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,911
instead of destroying them,
you're just blasting them with love 

974
00:47:56,911 --> 00:48:00,571
chemicals.
So that there's no way that they can 

975
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:00,571
fight.
He's going to poison a big population of

976
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:03,950
people with us are setting yourself up 
as that guy.

977
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:08,951
You're Johnny appleseed for Christ.
We're good at it.

978
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,660
I think I actually said Johnny appleseed
incorrectly,

979
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:16,661
right?
We have we ever discussed to Johnny 

980
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,401
appleseed,
isn't it existed then what did he do 

981
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:21,071
again?
He spread out apples throughout the 

982
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:21,071
midwest.
You couldn't be,

983
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:22,610
you wouldn't be the Johnny appleseed of 
ecstasy,

984
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,470
Ecstasy.
I,

985
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,950
you know,
I wouldn't mind.

986
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,980
That's what would be a great,
great claim to fame.

987
00:48:27,981 --> 00:48:32,981
But I'm not going to like,
I really obviously would never poison 

988
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:33,800
people if I.
even if I had the opportunity,

989
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:36,300
but at some point,
you know,

990
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,350
are drastic measures have to be taken.
That's what I'm saying.

991
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,110
Well listen,
what you're saying,

992
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:46,111
you're saying that you're not 
comfortable with the speed at which 

993
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:46,111
evolution is happening.
You,

994
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:51,000
it's obvious that people are evolving,
but you're not comfortable that people 

995
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,601
haven't reached your level yet.
So fucking solution is to engineer some 

996
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:54,601
way to poison them.

997
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:59,490
Let me just dose them.
You're going to use them as Guinea pigs 

998
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,360
and I'm for it.
I'm on time for it to you for it.

999
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,460
I think,
uh,

1000
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:08,190
if it was 100 percent safe,
yeah,

1001
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,920
but they would have to be all kids and 
black kids blankets.

1002
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,490
Well,
no.

1003
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:12,780
Even if just kidding,
I will not be.

1004
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,630
But what if it wasn't a hundred percent?
Say Yeah,

1005
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,900
the 80 percent

1006
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,530
they have to dig acid.
All right?

1007
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:26,650
Some people are happy as fuck.
Living a simple life and that is their 

1008
00:49:27,321 --> 00:49:30,200
prerogative.
This is a temporary experience.

1009
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,320
And just because you see some great 
depth into it doesn't mean you can pose 

1010
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,920
those ideals on other people that love a
simple life.

1011
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:42,090
They,
there's people that are genuinely like 

1012
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,200
country music.
They like feeding animals and they're 

1013
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,900
like making fucking sweet potato pie and
that's cool.

1014
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,990
They're called my parents.
Are Those your parents?

1015
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,140
Try and tickling.
I'm not.

1016
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,960
Here's the thing I'm not talking about 
like literally you have.

1017
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,670
It's never,
it's never going to happen.

1018
00:49:56,671 --> 00:49:58,620
I don't know.
But who could draw pictures of it?

1019
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,750
An interest?
You have diagrams.

1020
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:03,690
At what point do you

1021
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,720
do what anonymous is doing?
At what point do you go from looking at 

1022
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,180
the world and seeing some fucked up shit
going down?

1023
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,400
What point do you go from talking about 
this shit going down to actively trying 

1024
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,560
to fight against it?

1025
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,890
See the Warren Buffet thing?
No,

1026
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:27,310
Warren Buffet just wrote some big 
article on corporate taxes and why do

1027
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,040
I have to pay so little taxes?
Why do all my super rich friends get to 

1028
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,010
bed taxes?
Any described in detail.

1029
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:39,220
A bunch of crazy clauses that are in 
place that allowed these guys to only 

1030
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,761
have like 17 percent taxes and 
especially people that make their money 

1031
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:43,840
with money and you know,
there's,

1032
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:48,841
there's all sorts of things that can be 
factored in and because of that they 

1033
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:49,280
paid leave in less taxes and he's like,
this is crazy.

1034
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,140
Like this is all engineered.
Ridiculous.

1035
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,390
Like why are you protecting this super 
rich?

1036
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,240
It's really,
really fascinating.

1037
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,970
It's really fascinating because he 
stepped up and,

1038
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,180
and set and it uses the terms,
like my mega rich friends,

1039
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:04,280
my super rich friends,
you know,

1040
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:05,040
he,
you know,

1041
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,760
it really just kind of laid it all out.
It's fascinating.

1042
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,690
Were you know,
when do we do something about it?

1043
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,610
What do we do?
Because you got to do something.

1044
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,350
At some point,

1045
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,520
you bring it down.
Do we know who's going to build it?

1046
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,560
Go,
you don't.

1047
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,520
You don't have to bring it down,
but at some point you.

1048
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:23,940
I just heard this thing.
It's this guy that guy's a rant on.

1049
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,990
I don't even remember this show,
but it went viral and it's this guy 

1050
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:31,050
steamed up about Republican or Democrat.
It doesn't matter.

1051
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,260
There's a system in place that is 
pulling the wealth of the nation into 

1052
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,750
the overseas banking community or it was
like really intense and it went viral.

1053
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,490
It went super viral,
but then the question is,

1054
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,820
do we dose the irs or not?
Know at what point at what point your 

1055
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,400
bad trips,
they would have math trips.

1056
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:58,410
Oh my God.
It's a vision where they just literally 

1057
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,340
stole their money and they weren't poor 
and it couldn't fucking food themselves,

1058
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,580
but when do you do?
When do you see?

1059
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,430
Anyway,
this guy said,

1060
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,000
we have a BOT congress.

1061
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,360
He said,
the congress is in the pocket of 

1062
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:08,360
corporations.
Whether this is true or not,

1063
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,120
I don't know,
but I did read,

1064
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:12,440
if you go to a banners wikipedia page,
um,

1065
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,290
it's felt boner,
but painter b o e h n e r,

1066
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,870
if you go to his wikipedia page,
it talks about one of these cons.

1067
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,900
One of the controversies around him was 
that there was a big vote coming up 

1068
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,880
against big tobacco and right before the
vote happened,

1069
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
he went and passed out checks from big 
tobacco on the floor to all these like 

1070
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,470
senators or I don't want to passed it 
out publicly and I don't know why,

1071
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:44,820
what this exactly was,
but so that guys bought.

1072
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:49,910
He's passing out checks from tobacco 
companies in our government like that 

1073
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:51,360
guys bought.
It's on Wikipedia,

1074
00:52:51,361 --> 00:52:54,230
look it up and maybe someone can really 
explain to me why I did that or what,

1075
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,320
what,
what has happened there.

1076
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,650
So we have what's called a Bot congress.
We have our leaders,

1077
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,890
many of them are in the pockets of the 
corporations.

1078
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,050
Their decisions are based on the will of
the people.

1079
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:07,110
Their decisions are based on what's 
better for the corporations and the Mega

1080
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:10,510
Rich and fucking warren buffet just went
out and talked about it.

1081
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,660
At what point do we as a people make 
that stop?

1082
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,970
When does it happen?
Guess what?

1083
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,220
Democracy didn't work,
didn't work.

1084
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,510
They beat it.
They figured it out.

1085
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:22,400
Of course,
they figured it out.

1086
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:24,680
It's like the Rubik's cube.
You do it enough time.

1087
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:26,160
Somebody's going to fucking figure out a
beat.

1088
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,230
The Rubik's cube.
They figured it out.

1089
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,860
The fucking founding fathers talked 
about this very thing,

1090
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:33,600
the possibility of this kind of thing 
happening.

1091
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:36,030
It happened.
Now what do we do?

1092
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:41,120
What do you do?
Do you sit and drink starbucks and buy 

1093
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,401
your fucking iphone and and and fucking 
play video games and get on a podcast 

1094
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:47,730
from time to time and wine or do you 
fucking pig?

1095
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,640
When do you do something?
That's what I want to know.

1096
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:54,630
When do people act like and that's why 
I'm so fascinated with fucking anonymous

1097
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:57,120
right now because they're acting.
They're,

1098
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,500
no matter what people said,
oh,

1099
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,110
they're just a bunch of 14 year olds at 
the basement of their Bob's house.

1100
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,300
I don't think so.
They just fucking did it.

1101
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,140
They shut down train stations.
They're shutting shit down there.

1102
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:07,810
Like black.

1103
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,040
Yeah.
One one step away is Obama is going to 

1104
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,040
go on television going,
okay,

1105
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,140
just so you know,
we're now considering these guys 

1106
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,140
terrorists.
That's all it's going to happen.

1107
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,400
And then these 14 year olds that are in 
basements who are thinking they're doing

1108
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:20,330
a good job,
are now going,

1109
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:25,331
okay,
now we're going to get in prison for 60 

1110
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:25,331
years and now federal crime.
Okay.

1111
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:28,991
No,
I'm not worth them going back to work 

1112
00:54:28,991 --> 00:54:30,590
thing,
but that's all that stuff all they need 

1113
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:30,590
to do to stop,
but for the rest of the history,

1114
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:31,530
okay,
for the rest of history,

1115
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,890
if every member of whatever this 
mysterious weird group is,

1116
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:38,100
gets arrested tomorrow for the rest of 
time,

1117
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,940
they still will exist as an 
organization.

1118
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:46,941
That was one of the first emergent,
a revolutionary organizations in the 

1119
00:54:46,941 --> 00:54:49,710
technological age and to me that is 
amazing.

1120
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,370
Oh,
it's super amazing and I,

1121
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,380
I completely support them,
but that they're just better watch out 

1122
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,920
because I think that's coming.
I think they're doing it.

1123
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,420
They're going to be considered 
terrorists.

1124
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:00,850
The second course,
I mean,

1125
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:05,550
our country considers anything that goes
against their ideals,

1126
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:08,500
terrorism to the point where it's 
obvious that certain people aren't there

1127
00:55:08,501 --> 00:55:11,070
in surgeons.
Those are insurgents.

1128
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,860
What the fuck's an insurgent?
Yeah.

1129
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:15,420
Those are people who don't want you 
invading their country.

1130
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,180
They're not insurgents.
You're gonna.

1131
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,830
Call them an insurgent.
Do you know how many fucking kids?

1132
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:23,250
And uh,
Afghanistan died from a drone attacks.

1133
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:26,910
They just released it like 168 kids.
Dad from drone attacks.

1134
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,390
A lot of insurgents apparently.
Don't understand why you got to blow up 

1135
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,970
toddlers.
So the question is when,

1136
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,230
when,
when did people choose?

1137
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,820
I can imagine if you were living over 
there,

1138
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,950
if that's your role,
the dice.

1139
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:45,430
You're a fucking mountain goat herder in
Afghanistan and you literally are under 

1140
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:51,521
the power of various warlords.
No one city in the entire country cobble

1141
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:56,330
everything else.
Assist warlords,

1142
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,680
warlords,
dude or Lord,

1143
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:04,730
you know,
you know how they get the information 

1144
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:04,730
from the warlords?
They give him Viagra.

1145
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,710
That's how they find out where the 
Taliban is.

1146
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,140
They give him Viagra.
That's the number one move.

1147
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:15,290
July.
Hopefully you didn't learn that on 

1148
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:15,290
cinemax after.
Now.

1149
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:15,290
Dude,
I read that online.

1150
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,530
I read it online.
That's amazing.

1151
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,620
Authenticated.
It was on a major website.

1152
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,250
I don't remember what.

1153
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,100
So what we know,
but it totally makes sense.

1154
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,040
These old dudes,

1155
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,780
they can't fucking anymore and they have
all these.

1156
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,840
They all have all these hoes like when 
you're aboard,

1157
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:30,070
Lord,
you don't have one wife.

1158
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:32,260
You've got to bang a wives.
You got a gang of wives,

1159
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:33,280
right?
He's like,

1160
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:38,281
sixties.
Dick doesn't work anymore and he's got 

1161
00:56:38,281 --> 00:56:38,281
these 20 bitches.
He's trying to hold down.

1162
00:56:38,281 --> 00:56:38,540
It's hard.
Yeah.

1163
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:43,090
It's not like you can order Viagra when 
you live in a fucking deadly valley.

1164
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,800
Like they even knew about it.
Right?

1165
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,780
I bet the first time they ever dropped 
it and they're like,

1166
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:49,500
get the fuck outta here.
Wow.

1167
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:50,830
I killed it.
Makes your Dick hard.

1168
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,350
Like what color geniuses are out there?
Well,

1169
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:55,870
I'm herding goats on a mountain 
somewhere.

1170
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:02,090
It's fucked up that we can use those 
drones and other countries that we're 

1171
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:02,090
not even supposed to be at war with 
Pakistan.

1172
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,660
Just sneak a drone over there and shoot 
some shit.

1173
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:10,990
All right,
we're going to leave now with hell fire 

1174
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:15,361
missiles.
That's the craziest thing they named 

1175
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:15,361
them.
They don't have the name like h,

1176
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:15,361
two,
five,

1177
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:15,800
six,
no.

1178
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,900
Hell fire.
Hellfire missiles fired.

1179
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:19,810
Actually.
Then maybe they do.

1180
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,140
Maybe the hellfires that nickname.
Mad,

1181
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,170
angry,
angry,

1182
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,780
efficient autos to follow up.

1183
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,510
It's so creepy,
man.

1184
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,000
If you think about that stuff too much 
god,

1185
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:35,001
especially if you man,
if you eat mushrooms and your brain 

1186
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:36,750
decides to start thinking about the 
Taliban.

1187
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:39,330
Oh God,
that's the worst.

1188
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,360
You just.
I've rolled against the wall of my 

1189
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,480
fucking apartment,
clutching my head with visions of 

1190
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,440
bearded strangers,
strapping suicide bombs to their bodies 

1191
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:54,690
and wandering into the streets to blow 
up other people.

1192
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:59,610
When you really consider that this 
happens at this very second,

1193
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,430
right now,
there's two things happening.

1194
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:07,730
There's a guy at fucking Halliburton 
who's screwing the top on a hell fire 

1195
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:12,231
missile that no doubt will land in some 
playground in Afghanistan and a center 

1196
00:58:12,231 --> 00:58:13,260
eight some toddlers,
and he's like,

1197
00:58:13,261 --> 00:58:13,590
ah,

1198
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:14,840
almost off work

1199
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,330
these.
I got a screw on.

1200
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:22,510
There's that guy and then there's some 
guy in the Middle East right now 

1201
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:26,351
strapping a fucking belt around his 
waist and he's got a little time or a 

1202
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:29,900
phone and he's buttoning everything up 
and he knows that any second,

1203
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:33,560
like in the next hour or two,
he's going to be hamburger meat all over

1204
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:37,430
some fucking cafe or hotel.
That's so weird.

1205
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
We live in.
These are the two insane people and I 

1206
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,720
frankly think one's a lot crazier than 
the other and it ain't the fucking guy 

1207
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:46,720
with a bomb belt.

1208
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,330
It's the fucking Weirdos,
like just screw in the top side.

1209
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,390
Ms Dot wonder where these are going to 
go.

1210
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:58,650
Keep pushing these bombs.
Here's another box of Gloucester.

1211
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,070
Oops.
Ah,

1212
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:02,480
Shit.

1213
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,350
I wonder why it malfunctioned like that.
Perhaps we should analyze the four.

1214
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,870
13 chip a.
You just killed toddlers.

1215
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,590
Oh yeah,
of course.

1216
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:11,360
But I wonder what it.
What it is.

1217
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:15,560
Maybe the battery malfunctioned 
batteries malfunctioning in your heart.

1218
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,270
Murderers.
That's the thing.

1219
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:18,470
It's like,
why are we doing this?

1220
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,920
The fuck's going on that poppy field 
thing on internet where you're talking 

1221
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:23,920
about

1222
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:23,960
the soldiers standing in the poppy 
fields,

1223
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,920
yet another thing not to listen to when 
you're fucking begged,

1224
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,240
that'll send you a hireling into a 
paranoid episode quicker than seeing 

1225
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:32,240
your grandmother.

1226
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,570
That has never been a more clear 
indication that they're in on it than 

1227
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:41,440
soldiers guarding poppy fields.
And for me,

1228
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,000
he just to.
You got it.

1229
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:44,410
At a certain point in time,
you got to go,

1230
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:46,360
wait what?
They had uriel,

1231
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:51,390
Geraldo Rivera,
and he was interviewing one of the 

1232
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:51,390
soldiers.
There was like,

1233
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:51,390
yeah,
well we don't like it,

1234
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,070
but we have to guard the fields.
Uh,

1235
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,880
in order to get information for these 
people,

1236
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,580
we have to let them live their way of 
life.

1237
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,920
Like,
what are you talking about,

1238
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:02,050
son?
Are you really telling me you're letting

1239
01:00:02,051 --> 01:00:04,450
people grow heroin?
And you guys are guarding it.

1240
01:00:04,451 --> 01:00:05,410
But that's it.
That's all.

1241
01:00:05,411 --> 01:00:07,300
You don't have any financial stake in 
it.

1242
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:07,870
You know,
we're,

1243
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,870
we're taking American lives and they're 
over there with machine guns,

1244
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:13,330
gardening poppy fields.
For who?

1245
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,190
By who?
Against who?

1246
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,470
Excuse me,
what the fuck is going on?

1247
01:00:17,471 --> 01:00:19,240
We don't know.
Where's the money going?

1248
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,060
When you're,
you're,

1249
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,670
you're,
someone's getting paid.

1250
01:00:21,671 --> 01:00:26,671
You fuck.
You don't have soldiers one or two 

1251
01:00:26,671 --> 01:00:28,681
fields.
Unless there's some money being 

1252
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:28,681
exchanged.
Hands,

1253
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:28,681
period.
That's expensive to feed us.

1254
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:32,260
Why the fuck would they put the 
resources of those soldiers?

1255
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,900
Why would they put them to use in that 
area like that?

1256
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,160
You know what that makes me think 
though,

1257
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:41,161
man.
How fucking cool would it be to have 

1258
01:00:41,161 --> 01:00:43,081
your own army?
Wouldn't that be awesome to have like 

1259
01:00:43,081 --> 01:00:43,081
200,
like an army?

1260
01:00:43,081 --> 01:00:45,310
There's people that know what it's like 
to have an army to have like a.

1261
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,570
are you with having an army?

1262
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,340
Well,
you know what,

1263
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,230
what,
what happened with Blackwater,

1264
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,130
right?
Do you know what happened with now?

1265
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,940
Supposedly this is all supposedly the 
uh,

1266
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,980
they just got some giant crazy contract 
with the United Arab Emirates and 

1267
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,650
they're gonna,
you know,

1268
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,060
I think it's like an Abu Dhabi,
maybe I not.

1269
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,450
They're starting like a private 
military.

1270
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:10,150
You know,
he's putting together some crazy 

1271
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,070
mercenary group to shut down uprisings 
and make sure that no,

1272
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,820
no,
nobody shit happens and they'll lose all

1273
01:01:12,821 --> 01:01:13,120
their money.

1274
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,680
I heard of.
I actually heard about this.

1275
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,420
Isn't it called Cobra?
I don't know.

1276
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,520
I don't know if it's true.
It's true.

1277
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,680
Called Cobra.
Cobra.

1278
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:25,681
I made that up as well.
This guy

1279
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,580
who was the,
um,

1280
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,760
the guy that was the head of Blackwater 
is apparently got some huge deal to go 

1281
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,890
over there.
So I read a line that would make sense,

1282
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,590
man.
If I was some fucking dude in the Middle

1283
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,630
East like that.
Oh,

1284
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,810
I was a king.
I was like,

1285
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:41,220
I need to protect this shit.
I don't have to hire them.

1286
01:01:41,221 --> 01:01:43,670
And once you get to that position,
we ain't going to let that go.

1287
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,290
No one's letting that go.
Why would you let that go?

1288
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:50,350
I'm the king to shut the fuck up.
I got a new army where we got shit a 

1289
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:54,051
lock down.
Like you're going to resist any form of 

1290
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:54,051
the simulation.
I don't

1291
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:56,650
care what you song.
Google a palace.

1292
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:01,660
I got to keep up.
What would it be like to be a king and 

1293
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,050
have an acid trip?
Really deep acid trip.

1294
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,280
That's great.
I think so,

1295
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,480
yeah.
Like having a fucking Harem tripping on 

1296
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,260
acid and knowing you had access to a 
Harem and things got weird.

1297
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,900
Don't you think you would freak out 
thinking about all the people that hated

1298
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:17,140
you and all the people that wanted you 
dead,

1299
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,100
all the people that wanted your throne.
Sure.

1300
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,220
You just get the joke to dance

1301
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:25,220
for you and you'll forget about it.
I mean just being living in any sort of 

1302
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,790
a place where there's one person that is
thought to be the king,

1303
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:30,990
the king king,
King of Jordan and the King of Egypt,

1304
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:35,991
the king and the queen of.
That's got to be a terrifying position 

1305
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,330
to be the king.
Yeah.

1306
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,510
You must be totally paranoid all the 
time.

1307
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,440
Yeah,
of course.

1308
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:40,970
I mean,
look at that.

1309
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:46,090
Look at President Obama has got to ride 
and he's got to ride into kind of 

1310
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,910
bulletproof fucking hearst thing course 
also because he's black.

1311
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:49,690
Let's be honest.
That's the real reason.

1312
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:54,830
The real reason.
That's a big reason why people try to 

1313
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:54,830
kill Ronald Reagan.
Of course.

1314
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:58,720
You know,
people would think someone there wasn't 

1315
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,370
there some sort of a thwarted attempt 
against,

1316
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:02,350
um,
it was something about George w dot,

1317
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:04,560
but they got it like way before anything
happened.

1318
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,650
It was a grenade I think were trying to 
elaborate on stage.

1319
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,390
Either way.
There's,

1320
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,770
I mean there's,
there's always,

1321
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:16,140
there's always one crazy faction of 
society that wants this,

1322
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:20,190
this president dead or the United States
president did for whatever reason.

1323
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:25,330
But I always feel like with Obama,
like the shit that I hear online and the

1324
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,810
things that I've read,
it's like the racism.

1325
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,190
It's pretty obvious,
man.

1326
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,780
There's a lot of people don't just not 
like him as a person.

1327
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,850
They don't like him because he's black.
Oh,

1328
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:41,930
funny.
Talk about it pretty openly and calm a 

1329
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:42,450
monkey and calm.
Like it's like,

1330
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,480
it's really,
really fucking fascinating.

1331
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:47,910
Like the,
the level of disrespect.

1332
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:48,900
You know,
the idea.

1333
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:54,070
You just imagine right now the way 
you're going to feel the day after 

1334
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:57,951
Michele Bachmann gets elected,
if she kinda liked to imagine how you 

1335
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:57,951
going to feel.
I'm going to feel,

1336
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:03,080
I'm going to feel how much money does it
cost me every year to live in Vancouver 

1337
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
and I called my accountant and I'm going
to say,

1338
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:04,560
all right,
now,

1339
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:05,520
tell me what I would have to do.

1340
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,900
I'd have to pay taxes in both places.
Okay.

1341
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,020
I can do that though and I can live 
there and I keep.

1342
01:04:10,021 --> 01:04:11,580
I can still be United States Senate 
said,

1343
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,010
let's fucking do it.
I would just do it.

1344
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:19,011
I just moved the fuck up there is the 
way racist felt when Obama got elected.

1345
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:25,080
Of course that's been rocking sense of 
like horror that some people had,

1346
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,630
not because of his views,
not getting his ideas,

1347
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,160
but because he's black.
They were like,

1348
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,830
oh my fucking God.
This is it.

1349
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,050
This is it.
Charlie over sudden.

1350
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:34,710
Amazing.
Yeah.

1351
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:36,810
That's amazing.
So yeah man,

1352
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,790
it's completely out there.
And then you add onto that the fact that

1353
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,200
he fucking didn't exactly hit a home run
to put it lightly duty.

1354
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,440
He stepped up to plate and got hit with 
a meteor shower.

1355
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:54,710
I mean,
I don't think any president had any 

1356
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,710
chance of making any of this.
Look good.

1357
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,750
There was a gigantic scheme going on.
It collapsed and created this vortex of 

1358
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:06,651
suck and unemployment and home 
foreclosures and anybody stepping into 

1359
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:10,290
that vortex would have been sucked into 
its momentum.

1360
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:15,690
Yeah,
ducks that while he was in that fucking 

1361
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,980
vortex,
he like started

1362
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,170
saying that people could start rating 
medicinal marijuana.

1363
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:23,050
Dispensary is again under him.
They started doing that.

1364
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:28,620
Did they say that they rated them 
because they violated both state and 

1365
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:32,671
federal law?
Do you know because that was one of the 

1366
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:35,941
claims that Obama says.
He never said that he would stop rating 

1367
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:37,720
medical marijuana clinics.
I think the,

1368
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:42,750
the,
the language they used was they were 

1369
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,421
going to stop unless they were violating
both state and federal law.

1370
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:49,930
So if someone was selling marijuana,
you automatically violating federal law,

1371
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,450
but are you staying within the state 
guidelines?

1372
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,940
If so,
then we're going to leave you alone,

1373
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,460
but if not,
then we're gonna go after you and that's

1374
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:58,610
what they did.
That's what he said.

1375
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,280
Because I heard there was a new thing 
that's.

1376
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:02,020
I don't know.
I heard I heard that too,

1377
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:05,410
but I didn't investigate it enough to be
talking about it,

1378
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:08,470
but very hard for me to hate our country
so much.

1379
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,940
Duncan.
No,

1380
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,950
I love it,
but let me be clear about this.

1381
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:17,460
I don't think we're happy.
I'm not happy until there's full 

1382
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:21,901
legalization and here's the problem with
this idea of medical is that I believe,

1383
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,730
at least in my,
the way I understand it,

1384
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:29,731
that it can be interpreted,
that the only way you're supposed to be 

1385
01:06:29,731 --> 01:06:32,281
running one of these collectives and 
dispensary's is you're not supposed to 

1386
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:35,191
be making any profit.
I believe they're supposed to be not a 

1387
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:38,881
nonprofit sort of a business,
but obviously these people are making a 

1388
01:06:38,881 --> 01:06:42,631
fuck load of money,
so it's a very tricky sort of a gray 

1389
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,890
area that's going on right now,
so I'm not,

1390
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,410
I'm not even happy with just the medical
distinction.

1391
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,680
It's silliness.
It's 2011.

1392
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:54,650
Any argument about giving any,
any inches or any.

1393
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,920
Just anything at all in that direction.
Like,

1394
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:58,840
okay,
well maybe we should make it illegal.

1395
01:06:58,841 --> 01:07:00,400
If you're not,
stop it.

1396
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,870
It's a fucking plant.
All right.

1397
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,690
You can't.
You can't make it illegal.

1398
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:07,060
You can't.
It's a fucking plant.

1399
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:11,200
It grows in the ground.
You can't say it's no good if it's not.

1400
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:16,570
It's not a poison.
How come there's all these plants that 

1401
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:16,570
grow strychnine?
They make strict none.

1402
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,260
They don't.
They don't.

1403
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,220
You can buy them.

1404
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:23,460
You could sell Salvia at target and I 
would think that Salvia is way more 

1405
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:23,460
dangerous for kids.

1406
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,280
Salvia plants the nursery.
Go check.

1407
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:30,230
That's the same type of Salvia.
I don't know,

1408
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:35,250
but I do know that they sell the San 
Pedro Cactus at like Home Depot San 

1409
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,310
Pedro.
Cactus is how you get Mescalin.

1410
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,170
Wow.
Yeah.

1411
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,380
That's where pod comes from.
You can take that fucking cactus and you

1412
01:07:41,381 --> 01:07:42,730
can,
if you know how to do it.

1413
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:44,040
There's a whole,
there's a bunch of,

1414
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,440
you know,
like,

1415
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:50,450
uh,
forums that will show you how to go 

1416
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:50,620
through step by step process online.
Yeah,

1417
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:51,940
man,
it's fucked up.

1418
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,590
Fucking.
It's ridiculous.

1419
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,390
It's not just fucked up.
It's like that.

1420
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,360
If there's a,
there's a one thing that has to happen,

1421
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:03,630
the first thing that's going to happen.
And people don't put as much stock into 

1422
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:04,480
this idea because it seems like a silly 
request,

1423
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,460
but if you could fix anything about the 
world,

1424
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:11,461
what would you do?
I'd make psychedelics regularly 

1425
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:14,400
available and legal and have people and 
devote energy and money to studying them

1426
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,040
and

1427
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,840
distributing them correctly and get 
people who are showmen to take people in

1428
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:24,080
authentic trips,
people who have navigated these worlds.

1429
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:29,170
And then when the people come back and 
they need like help with this 

1430
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,110
reprogramming.
You sit down with them.

1431
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:35,111
You have groups of people that have also
had the experience to sit down with 

1432
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:35,111
them.
Discuss what about it?

1433
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,130
Did it make you think about yourself?
Was that it?

1434
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:39,410
Was there anything that like glaringly 
obvious you needed to change?

1435
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,030
And then you know,
the person would say,

1436
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:41,520
yeah,
we'll,

1437
01:08:41,521 --> 01:08:43,100
there's this fucking thing that freaks 
me out.

1438
01:08:43,101 --> 01:08:45,650
I'm kind of a cheap fuck.
And I think we need to deal with that.

1439
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:46,070
Right?
I mean,

1440
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:47,030
you're kind of selfish.
Yeah,

1441
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:47,390
yeah,
yeah.

1442
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:48,620
I don't know what it is.
I just like,

1443
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:51,050
it's fucking,
it's a force of habit and if you're,

1444
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:56,170
if you have any weird sort of a 
personality tick like that and you do 

1445
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:56,170
any psychedelic,
even eat pot,

1446
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,290
just eat,
eat a cookie,

1447
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:57,560
Matt.

1448
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,250
That's the first thing that's going to 
hit you.

1449
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:01,010
You're going to think about being a 
creepy person.

1450
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,440
Think about your creepy behavior.
You know,

1451
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,500
and if,
if there's ever a way to reengineer 

1452
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,590
society,
it's to shock people out of their 

1453
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,060
current pattern of behavior that they 
find almost unavoidable.

1454
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,950
The same patterns that caused people to 
overeat or chronic masturbation.

1455
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,390
The we have to figure out a way to blast
people out of those shock you out of the

1456
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:28,391
pattern.
Show you yourself from an angle or 

1457
01:09:28,391 --> 01:09:29,990
perspective that's not available without
the psychedelic,

1458
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:32,480
than bring you back and give you 
something to think about.

1459
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,520
You know,
it's like these little trips,

1460
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:38,390
these little blasts,
the just little bursts of evolution.

1461
01:09:38,391 --> 01:09:41,270
It's society.
You see yourself,

1462
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,250
you see how you can fit.
You see,

1463
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:44,840
Nice,
you see positive,

1464
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:46,700
good.
I'll see you in a couple months and just

1465
01:09:46,701 --> 01:09:47,840
keep doing that.

1466
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,840
And every couple months people go in and
get blasted,

1467
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,430
talk to people,
people,

1468
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:56,510
talk them through situations and tell 
them about ego.

1469
01:09:56,511 --> 01:09:59,360
And then it's all a trick and it's just 
temporary anyway,

1470
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,230
men,
the most,

1471
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:05,260
the best feeling you'll ever get is to 
be really cool to as many people as you 

1472
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:05,930
can,
the best feeling you'll ever get.

1473
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,270
It's just to be nice to as many people 
as you can.

1474
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,250
Be friendly to them,
shake their hand,

1475
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:15,251
hug them if you can,
and just be someone that other people 

1476
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:16,790
enjoy to be around.
When you do that,

1477
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:19,640
you create positive energy.
You create love.

1478
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:20,930
You create this,
this,

1479
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:25,931
this,
this burst comes from you and you 

1480
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:29,471
attracted and you bring it into your 
seeing a couple of months and then the 

1481
01:10:30,941 --> 01:10:35,941
guy goes back every couple of months,
did one trip after another and a year 

1482
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:37,540
later you gotta.
You can't even recognize this guy.

1483
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:42,780
A year later,
this guy is fucking eating organic food 

1484
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,370
and drinking coconut water and go into 
cross fit and reading about the Bhagavad

1485
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,050
Gita and he become a different human 
being.

1486
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:49,210
You become a human being.
That's,

1487
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,550
that's actualized.

1488
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,800
That's a good word.
It's a good word.

1489
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,020
You know,
that is possible.

1490
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:02,110
You can evolve without drugs.
You can evolve just with hard work and 

1491
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:06,340
focus and attention in meditation or you
can just take the drugs and get there 

1492
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:06,950
way quicker.
It's up to you man.

1493
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,050
Go crazy.
And combined it two,

1494
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,130
you know,
you don't.

1495
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:12,290
It's not like we can only do one or the 
other.

1496
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:14,250
Actually I found the combination of the 
two

1497
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,170
is amazing.
Getting really high and chanting is such

1498
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:21,250
a perfect synergy.
It's the,

1499
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,780
it's so fun to do,
but I mean getting high,

1500
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:24,770
doing anything,
it's pretty

1501
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,320
to be the most amazing is getting high 
and doing yoga.

1502
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:30,380
Dude,
I love to get super big.

1503
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,810
I'll get begged and hotel rooms and I'll
do yoga.

1504
01:11:32,811 --> 01:11:37,000
I got like some,
a few dvds and I got one thing that I've

1505
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:42,001
downloaded that I can watch on my laptop
doomed get which is bullitt streaked.

1506
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:47,650
So you're just in tune with every fiber 
of your muscles and you're holding these

1507
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:53,170
poses and I'm reading from this book 
that as this fucking black and white 

1508
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:56,981
photo of this Indian dude doing it from 
1934 and he's doing these crazy ass 

1509
01:11:57,741 --> 01:12:01,820
fucking poses and I'm holding him in his
hotel room and then after I'm done,

1510
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:06,821
man,
it's like it takes the high and brings 

1511
01:12:06,821 --> 01:12:09,821
it to this completely new room.
It's super clean and it's like you sit 

1512
01:12:11,781 --> 01:12:16,781
here in this new room and just this is 
just relax a little until the yoga wears

1513
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:18,470
off.
Then you can go right back in.

1514
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:23,060
It's like it puts you in some crazy new 
high room or you're like,

1515
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,530
I can see things so well right now.
It's like my body's in balance.

1516
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,670
My mind is imbalanced.
I can see things so clearly.

1517
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:34,940
Troubling.
Decision seemed so obvious.

1518
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:40,230
I would love to see both of your 
favorite thing to do high together at 

1519
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,531
the same time,
like you chanting and you're doing yoga 

1520
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:45,661
in the same room.
I think that you guys should do that 

1521
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:45,661
sometime.
It'd be very well,

1522
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:45,661
but we can put that online and dudes.
Right.

1523
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:49,330
Beat off to fucking God.
Bear 69 cock beat officer thing.

1524
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:56,600
Cool.
I love your asshole

1525
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:57,550
Henry.
Awesome.

1526
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,110
Can I ask you something?
Brian started talking about it.

1527
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:04,290
So what'd you think of planet of Apes?
Listen Bro.

1528
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,100
Oh,
here we go.

1529
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:05,930
I got

1530
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,990
way more chimping me than the average 
person.

1531
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,990
So you put me in movie with chimps.
Start fucking shit up.

1532
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,320
I get very excited.
All right.

1533
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:19,720
I thought the CGI was the shit I thought
for a movie for like what?

1534
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:24,800
I like to go to the movies to say I want
to see some fun shit.

1535
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:27,110
I like comic book movies.
I like,

1536
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:32,200
you know,
like x men was the latest Eczema and I 

1537
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:32,810
really liked that one a lot.
I liked that kind of shit.

1538
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:35,270
I like ridiculous movies.
First Class.

1539
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,760
I just liked that one.
I liked shit.

1540
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:40,160
That's like,
I like stuff that's fun,

1541
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:42,500
you know,
I wanna I want to just get into it.

1542
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:47,980
And to me this movie was so.
First of all the special effects were 

1543
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,330
fucking insane.
So close to perfect,

1544
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:52,970
swell.
Close to seeming like real chimps.

1545
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,110
Can I say something?
Yeah,

1546
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,750
here we go.
I don't want to see it.

1547
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,670
You haven't seen it?
No,

1548
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:02,190
I've seen it,
but I don't want to see chimp cock.

1549
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,680
But none of those chimps that genitals.
It's true from PG.

1550
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:07,410
Thirteen.
Well,

1551
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:12,411
it's not that they didn't have genitals,
they just never showed you an angle 

1552
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:12,411
where you could the deck.

1553
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:14,470
Here's the thing was just clever 
photography.

1554
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:19,530
Everything.
Everything that you've just described 

1555
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:22,291
about the movie.
I agree with the CGI was fucking cool 

1556
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,740
and there were some really cool moments,
but what bothered me about the movie or 

1557
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,590
really bothered me about the movie,
um,

1558
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,720
was the penis and what made it,
what made it kind of what made me really

1559
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:35,740
start eating it a halfway through and 
get embarrassed by it and just think,

1560
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:40,741
oh,
I'll never go see a fucking movie again 

1561
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:40,741
in my life.
Yeah.

1562
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:44,281
I got so pissed because I saw at the 
beginning fucking News Corp and I was 

1563
01:14:44,281 --> 01:14:44,281
like,
oh,

1564
01:14:44,281 --> 01:14:45,250
here we go.
How did fucking Rupert Murdoch fuck this

1565
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:46,990
up?
How did he fuck it up?

1566
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:52,260
These chimps,
these fucking chimps who have been 

1567
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,451
tortured in laboratories who I've,
I told you by the time I almost got 

1568
01:14:54,451 --> 01:14:55,420
killed by a chimpanzee already,
right?

1569
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,510
I told you that story.
When was this?

1570
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:03,870
I didn't tell you that story.
Even if you did tell him to tell me 

1571
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:06,481
again.
I'm sure a lot of people never heard of 

1572
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:06,481
it.
Tell me.

1573
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:08,200
So I,
for this pilot I did for comedy central,

1574
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:13,710
we had a chimpanzee as one of the gags 
where I was playing chess with a 

1575
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,880
chimpanzee and the chimpanzee beat me at
a move.

1576
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,050
And so,
so I go,

1577
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,560
I'm smarter than me.
She's a stupid quick gag,

1578
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,950
like a computer hooked up to the champ 
and like the,

1579
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,350
it says checkmate,
the commuters that.

1580
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:29,460
Right.
So I was really excited about this day 

1581
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:29,600
and my friend,
uh,

1582
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:34,980
Tom Janice,
who was the co creator of the show and 

1583
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:34,980
directed it was,
um,

1584
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:35,530
he,
uh,

1585
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:37,300
he kept telling me,
Dunkin,

1586
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:38,830
is that you?
Do you think there's any way we could do

1587
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:41,710
this without a chimp or do you really 
want to have a chimpanzee?

1588
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:46,710
Because I've worked with chimpanzees 
before and they're really hard to 

1589
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,280
control on set and they're dangerous and
I'm like,

1590
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,930
no,
I want to work with a chimp man.

1591
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:56,160
I'm not going to say no to Oregon with a
chimp and they're not dangerous and 

1592
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,771
they're going to sense that I'm a nice 
guy and the chimpanzee is going to know 

1593
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:02,281
I'm okay and it's going to be fine.
I was looking forward to this for days 

1594
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:03,610
because I've always wanted to fucking 
hold a chimpanzee.

1595
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:06,640
So a fucking.
The chimp gets here,

1596
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:11,641
you know that.
I know the chimps there cause it's 

1597
01:16:11,641 --> 01:16:13,420
punching.
The hardwood floor is hard as it can,

1598
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:16,750
as it's coming down through to where 
we're shooting.

1599
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:18,970
It's just punching the floor,
punching the floor,

1600
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,590
punching the floor,
Bang,

1601
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,940
Bang,
Bang.

1602
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:27,390
This fucking thing.
It looks like if you took a toddler and 

1603
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,671
just blasted it with steroids,
it's like imagine the most muscular 

1604
01:16:29,671 --> 01:16:31,270
toddler with the worst case of add on 
the planet.

1605
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,600
That's a chimpanzee.
And so right before we started shooting,

1606
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,250
the guy says,
okay,

1607
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:39,250
just so you guys know this,
a very friendly monkey.

1608
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,730
I'm cold monkey or I'm sorry,
chimp,

1609
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:43,200
I'm,
I've,

1610
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:48,220
I'm going to get trainers sucks too 
much.

1611
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,830
I'm trying to determine is there a 
Harvard for chimp trainers?

1612
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:53,260
You just fucking get a chimp.
If you say you're a trainer,

1613
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,830
you can rent the thing out.
Don't you have to be a problem at all?

1614
01:16:55,831 --> 01:16:56,980
Just or something.
I don't know.

1615
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,080
Okay.
So this fucking monkey.

1616
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,500
So he's like,
just,

1617
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:02,200
you know,
the chimpanzees,

1618
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:07,201
the most strongest person in the room if
he comes up to you,

1619
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:09,670
he just wants to say hi.
He's very friendly,

1620
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,680
just don't make any quick movements.
And so suddenly this chimp is sitting in

1621
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:18,430
front of me and it goes from being like,
oh,

1622
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:23,570
this is going to be cute to being like,
this is no different than being with a 

1623
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:23,570
tiger.

1624
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:28,690
This thing is fucking strong.
It seems kind of focused in core right 

1625
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,350
now.
But it was being a little weird earlier.

1626
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:32,210
How big was it?
Uh,

1627
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:33,530
I,
I don't,

1628
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:38,590
I don't know the weight of the thing.
It was probably like a little higher 

1629
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:38,590
than my waist,
like with a,

1630
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:42,080
with a chimp crouch happening.
So you say maybe 70 pounds,

1631
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:43,790
80 pounds?
Um,

1632
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:47,570
I'd say like a,
probably 80 pounds or something.

1633
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:48,440
I don't know.
I don't know.

1634
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:49,910
I don't know.
So it's not a baby?

1635
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:50,920
No,
it's a,

1636
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,150
it's a middle aged little guy wearing 
blue jeans.

1637
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:55,850
I think it's more than 100.
I don't.

1638
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:56,810
I don't know.
It wasn't.

1639
01:17:56,811 --> 01:17:57,260
No,
I could.

1640
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,730
I don't know.
I could've picked it up.

1641
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,630
Muscular Shit.
Right.

1642
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:02,330
So the real muscular.
So we're,

1643
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,460
we're starting to do the scene.
Chimps.

1644
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:05,660
Got to move a piece,
by the way,

1645
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:07,040
for animal rights people out there.

1646
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,390
I will never,
ever,

1647
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:13,450
ever,
ever use a chimpanzee again in anything 

1648
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,210
that I ever do.
I don't advocate it.

1649
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:16,070
It's cruel.
It's a horrible thing.

1650
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:21,220
It's fucked up.
These creatures belong and habitats are 

1651
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,310
in the wild.
They do not belong on a movie set.

1652
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,350
They're very cool,
very cool creatures.

1653
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,850
But that's a.
it's a terrible thing.

1654
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,320
I agree.
Totally.

1655
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:32,350
I'm fucking sitting there and the 
basically in like two seconds,

1656
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:39,750
the chimp went from being calm and kind 
of focused to screaming at the top of 

1657
01:18:41,321 --> 01:18:46,270
its lungs and shooting past me.
It may be 20 miles per hour,

1658
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,540
like like there's no way I could have 
reacted if it wanted to pounce on me.

1659
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:52,570
I couldn't have blocked it.
It was just this bang,

1660
01:18:52,571 --> 01:18:56,770
like a whitening bullet shoots by me and
runs to the top of this divider.

1661
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,140
So now it's pulling like a King Kong.

1662
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:03,220
It's like it's screaming at all of us 
and I'm like,

1663
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:06,820
fuck.
I'm feeling the worst sense of guilt and

1664
01:19:06,821 --> 01:19:08,260
fear.
Anyway,

1665
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:10,330
we'll get it back down.
Holy Shit.

1666
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,430
We get it back down.
Everything's fine again.

1667
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:17,610
It's like nothing happened.
I didn't just freak out and just have 

1668
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:17,610
it.
It's cool.

1669
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:17,610
Gets off.
It's like,

1670
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:17,610
Whoa,
Whoa,

1671
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:17,610
whoa.
Hold on.

1672
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,410
This thing freaked out.
And you went back to work with it again.

1673
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:21,970
Yes.
Oh my God.

1674
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:25,310
I went back to work,
went back to work to get the shot.

1675
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:27,130
Man.
It's low budget and fuck it man.

1676
01:19:27,131 --> 01:19:29,440
Let's go for it.
So what if I lose my hockey?

1677
01:19:29,441 --> 01:19:34,441
And I was terrified.
It was a bad decision in retrospect to 

1678
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:34,441
them in the moment.
I decided to do it.

1679
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:40,650
So things in front of me again and it's 
calmed down and it's kind of cool.

1680
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,520
Now I look over,
the trainer is sweating like,

1681
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:48,790
you know,
nervous sweat,

1682
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:50,110
like nervous,
nervous sweat.

1683
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:54,730
And I swear I hear the guy who's with 
him whisper to him.

1684
01:19:56,410 --> 01:20:01,020
Should we go ahead relationship?
Not yet.

1685
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:03,210
He yells,
yells at the guy.

1686
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:08,540
So I'm thinking like,
did he just suggest that they dart the 

1687
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:12,130
big dark the chimp or something?
Like they calm it down like something's 

1688
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:12,570
not right with the chimp right now.
So anyway,

1689
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,050
thing goes for me again,
not for me,

1690
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:19,410
but shoots out of the chair again.
The guy tackles it.

1691
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,770
Football tackles the chimp,
right?

1692
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,350
Football tackles this poor fucking 
creature.

1693
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:31,130
The guy hits his head on a chair,
he hits his nose on a chair from 

1694
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,000
tackling the champ.
The chimp didn't,

1695
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,010
uh,
the chimp didn't bite him,

1696
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:36,450
but he,
he,

1697
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:38,190
he hit his nose.
I saw him do it.

1698
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,850
So because he tackled the champ,
why do you tackle the chimp?

1699
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:45,630
He saw something in the chimps eyes that
made him think,

1700
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:48,060
I got to tackle this chimp.
So he tackles the chimp.

1701
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,820
He stands up every,
I look around,

1702
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:54,990
the crew is like white faced.
I'm sitting here frozen in terror.

1703
01:20:55,290 --> 01:21:00,290
I look over the chimp is projectile 
vomiting bananas because that's what 

1704
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:03,270
they do and they get anxious and the was
like,

1705
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:04,080
guys,
we can go on.

1706
01:21:04,081 --> 01:21:05,520
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

1707
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,630
Blood running down his face from where 
he slammed into the chair,

1708
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:12,270
just blood just gushing down the guy's 
face.

1709
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:14,250
And uh,

1710
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:15,730
no.
I'm like,

1711
01:21:15,731 --> 01:21:16,180
no,
you know what?

1712
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:17,470
I think we got it.
Let's,

1713
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:19,630
let's call us.
Let's call this a day.

1714
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:22,120
And that,
that happened man.

1715
01:21:22,121 --> 01:21:27,121
Those fucking things are fast and deadly
and dangerous and fucking kind of half 

1716
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,580
insane because they're out of their 
environment.

1717
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:35,790
So when I went to see planet of apes and
the first time one of those chimps went 

1718
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:40,300
to kill someone and the chimps like,
no,

1719
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:42,200
no,

1720
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,930
you know,
we mustn't kill.

1721
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:46,750
Let's let these humans live.
I'm like,

1722
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:51,751
fuck that chimps.
If they were superintelligent they'd be 

1723
01:21:51,751 --> 01:21:54,310
ripping people to like fucking Turkey on
Thanksgiving.

1724
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,530
That's what annoyed me about it should 
have been brutal.

1725
01:21:56,531 --> 01:22:01,531
It was more real that you wanted to be 
more realistic to see monkeys like 

1726
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,280
written,
not just by the way,

1727
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:08,400
like all these monkeys seem really good 
at jumping through a office glass.

1728
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,710
If they.
If they weren't,

1729
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:15,711
it would be the most boring movie ever.
If they're all hitting the glass and 

1730
01:22:15,711 --> 01:22:18,290
falling back,
grabbing the workers in the office and 

1731
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,890
slamming their bodies into the glass,
like bean bags,

1732
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:23,700
it's splitting them like fucking so you 
didn't have fun with the movie at all.

1733
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:28,701
You couldn't look at it.
I did think that some of that jump into 

1734
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:31,401
the glass shit was ridiculous,
but I was willing to let it go because 

1735
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:31,401
it was a fun movie.

1736
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:31,401
Yeah,
that's what I would think.

1737
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:31,890
So me.
It was just so fun.

1738
01:22:31,891 --> 01:22:34,130
Bad ass moving.
Listen,

1739
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,970
there is that part of my brains here 
that's like,

1740
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:37,050
well,
this is fucking cool,

1741
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:38,640
but I'm not discounting what you're 
saying.

1742
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:41,070
I completely agree with you.
If they went full chimpanzee,

1743
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:42,620
what a.
What a champ would really be lucky.

1744
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,880
As intelligent.
Who would be a horror film?

1745
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:48,750
A horror film of epic proportions with 
the chimps would storm the town and just

1746
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:50,350
kill all the people.
Exactly.

1747
01:22:50,351 --> 01:22:52,530
Utilize them.
That's really what would happen.

1748
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,410
I saw this really cool picture on this 
website.

1749
01:22:56,411 --> 01:23:00,700
I go to call this information and that 
sounds like a real credible source.

1750
01:23:00,701 --> 01:23:01,810
It's a great website,
man.

1751
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:04,930
They put up here the invitation dot.
What did you.

1752
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,040
Where'd you get the article?

1753
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,680
Oh,
it was on disinformation.com.

1754
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:12,870
That sounds like you immediately just 
fall into one of those people that are 

1755
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:14,130
constantly searching for the truth 
behind the lies.

1756
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,600
It's not a conspiracy side.
It's more like it's a good site.

1757
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:21,601
I'm just.
I'm just saying like I've go to her it 

1758
01:23:21,601 --> 01:23:23,821
all the time.
I'm just saying that if that's one of 

1759
01:23:23,821 --> 01:23:26,400
those like hot buttons like 
disinformation dot Com Info.

1760
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:31,440
It's like a website cause we lie to you.
They have the book to the people that 

1761
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:33,370
have.
You're being lied to.

1762
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:38,380
Is that the people that produce that 
book right in and the whole series of 

1763
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:38,380
those books,
which are great.

1764
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,190
Fantastic.
By the way,

1765
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,230
books you.
You realize.

1766
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:44,380
How many times do you have been lied to?
All throughout history and it's like,

1767
01:23:44,381 --> 01:23:47,370
Whoa,
what the hell about that too?

1768
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,870
Everything,
but there's a picture on this site,

1769
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:55,900
have a painting.
Someone did a planet of the apes and 

1770
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,241
it's these apes with guns standing in 
front of a pile of dead human bodies 

1771
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:02,150
like their hunters posing with like 
things that they've killed.

1772
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:04,550
Now.
That's cool when I see that because then

1773
01:24:04,551 --> 01:24:07,460
they're really playing that like we flip
the script.

1774
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:12,700
Here's what we years that planet of the 
apes by showing monkeys behaving like 

1775
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:18,581
humans do.
It was a cool creative way to amplify 

1776
01:24:18,581 --> 01:24:20,900
the cruelty and humanity and brutality 
of humans.

1777
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:26,110
That was an important aspect of it is 
the monkeys were supposed to be a cruel 

1778
01:24:26,991 --> 01:24:28,460
to things that they didn't think were 
smart,

1779
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:34,060
so the fact that these are distant 
ancestors started off as like what 

1780
01:24:35,031 --> 01:24:40,031
appears to be.
It seems like while that chimp was 

1781
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:42,491
getting educated,
he got a nice heavy dose of like some 

1782
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:45,020
form of like,
this is no spoilers by the way.

1783
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:50,050
Right?
You're not going to drop some spoilers 

1784
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:50,050
on us because I haven't seen it yet.
It's planted the fucking names.

1785
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:51,050
If you don't know what's about talking 
monkeys.

1786
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,990
Yeah.
It's a little bit of a spoiler.

1787
01:24:55,991 --> 01:24:56,920
Sorry.
Look,

1788
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,310
I see what you're saying.
I think.

1789
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,460
I don't think that.
Oh,

1790
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,030
come on,
man.

1791
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,440
That movie.
It was fun for me.

1792
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:07,710
I enjoy the shit out of it,
but you could make a movie where it 

1793
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:10,180
would be all of the scenes from King 
Kong and from the hulk,

1794
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:13,480
whether they were just smashing 
everything and I would watch that movie.

1795
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:18,680
You'd be like 40 minutes.
I would pay $20 to go see just a video 

1796
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:23,440
of the whole fucking shit up for 20 
minutes and fucking shit up.

1797
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:24,730
Yeah.
That's so fun.

1798
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:27,400
The people screaming when he's stepping 
on them.

1799
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:29,920
The last King Kong.
That's awesome.

1800
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,860
I just love the idea of the special 
effects.

1801
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:35,290
Did you like Godzilla as much?
Yeah.

1802
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:37,150
I liked that when I was a kid.
You know?

1803
01:25:37,151 --> 01:25:39,820
What were those movies back then were so
stupid.

1804
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,050
It's like you,
you,

1805
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,150
you,
we all agreed that we're stupid.

1806
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:45,070
We didn't think that was like a real 
monster.

1807
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,170
There was no doubt.
That was not a real monster,

1808
01:25:47,171 --> 01:25:50,830
but we were willing to go along with it 
because it was kind of fun.

1809
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:54,670
There was no doubt the water would not 
move that way if it was really the ocean

1810
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,830
that's a goddamn bathtub,
there's no doubt,

1811
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:00,880
but we were willing to accept it because
it was kind of cool movie.

1812
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,340
What?
What's fun for me now is I just love

1813
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:09,340
watching these artificially created 
creatures that have been rendered on a 

1814
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:14,030
computer and people are interacting with
them.

1815
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,250
That to me,
like the King Kong scene,

1816
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:20,870
when when King Kong falls down in the 
newest king county falls down in between

1817
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:25,871
these two into a,
like a big crater or something like 

1818
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:26,450
that.
It's a big canyon.

1819
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:31,451
Anyway,
he falls down to this big crack and 

1820
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:32,090
there's all these vines and shit and 
he's duking it out with trx is all along

1821
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:37,091
the way.
Wally's like juggling this chick and 

1822
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:37,091
while you're watching it's like,
God damn,

1823
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:40,760
this is a motion picture piece of art.
This is a masterpiece.

1824
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:45,761
What they've done.
This really does look like a giant 

1825
01:26:45,761 --> 01:26:48,560
gorilla fighting off t rexes that's 
fucking bad ass and it's really.

1826
01:26:48,561 --> 01:26:50,780
It really does look like kids 
interacting with trees.

1827
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:55,930
It really does.
It's amazing when the fucking gorilla 

1828
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:59,420
gets to the ground,
starts duking it out with them and it's 

1829
01:26:59,420 --> 01:26:59,420
like,
that really looks like a really.

1830
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:03,790
This is incredible.
Blown away by that shit blown away 

1831
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:06,770
because I can't I when you hear about 
like computer languages,

1832
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:11,771
like I've watched John Carmax do this,
this speech about the new technology in 

1833
01:27:11,771 --> 01:27:16,300
their game rage and like all the 
different cool tweaks and different 

1834
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,390
things that they've done with it.
Remember when we went there,

1835
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,760
when we were in Dallas,
we got a chance to go.

1836
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:24,940
It's software.
They let us go walk around the studio 

1837
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:24,940
and look at the game before it was ever 
made.

1838
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:29,800
Dude,
you will listen to him talk and it's 

1839
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,990
like my brain is so far removed from any
of this knowledge.

1840
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:37,890
I his what he's discussing with how they
created video game moves,

1841
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:43,360
how they,
how they have changed the way the game 

1842
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,761
interacts with people and I know he's 
doing this with ones and zeros or 

1843
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,810
numbers on white paper.
It's so far.

1844
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,120
He's my.
He might as well be an alien.

1845
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:53,390
He might as well be an alien.
He might as well be a different species.

1846
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:59,290
They May.
Somebody was just telling me that 

1847
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:02,600
programmers brain start working 
differently because they're constantly 

1848
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,160
thinking and coding language and it 
creates this difference in the way their

1849
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:07,230
brains work,
which I didn't really understand,

1850
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:08,700
but that totally makes sense.
Yeah.

1851
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:13,701
When I just want.
I use photoshop and I think like 

1852
01:28:13,701 --> 01:28:16,670
somebody built this,
like somebody figured out how to do 

1853
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:16,670
this,
that,

1854
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:19,650
that is insane to me.
It's who are these people?

1855
01:28:19,651 --> 01:28:24,651
It's like we're giving academy awards 
and like huge awards and accolades to 

1856
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:30,380
like symmetrical people who are really 
good at like reciting lines in a 

1857
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:34,251
specific way.
How come like the famous people in our 

1858
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:36,690
society aren't these super geniuses who 
are building phones?

1859
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:41,691
Why don't we have like awards for people
who make the crazy shit that makes our 

1860
01:28:41,701 --> 01:28:43,440
life so much better?
It's really weird,

1861
01:28:43,441 --> 01:28:44,850
Jonny Lynn's fit flair.

1862
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:46,770
It is very weird.
Well,

1863
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:49,580
let's.
Because our society is sort of developed

1864
01:28:49,581 --> 01:28:54,581
and evolved without much planning.
It's sort of just happened and as we are

1865
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:59,891
this weird combination of evolving being
an animal with needs and instincts,

1866
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:06,590
there's a lot of variables that don't 
get it accounted for as it'd behavior 

1867
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:12,591
forms into patterns and you know,
and cultures evolve around giant masses 

1868
01:29:12,591 --> 01:29:17,391
of land that it doesn't get planned out.
But I always feel just like a field with

1869
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:21,420
any pattern that is established in 
nature.

1870
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:24,180
I always feel that the most fucked up 
human behavior,

1871
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:29,181
all of it.
The whole pile of it all has got to all 

1872
01:29:29,181 --> 01:29:30,030
be natural.
That's all almost unavoidable.

1873
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:35,031
That this is just what the human being 
does and as we are older and have much 

1874
01:29:35,521 --> 01:29:38,460
less responsibility than most people,
you know,

1875
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:40,380
30 years ago,
you know,

1876
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:44,910
or rather a 300 years ago,
our age were literally dying,

1877
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:46,740
you know,
500 years ago.

1878
01:29:46,741 --> 01:29:48,560
How long,
how long do people live in,

1879
01:29:48,561 --> 01:29:49,920
you know,
and it was,

1880
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:51,180
it was,
it was normal.

1881
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,560
It was normal a thousand years ago.

1882
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,120
Oh No,
I looked at that.

1883
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,420
I think it's like 32 years.
If you can look up the lifespan of 

1884
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:02,340
people,
it's like a thousand years ago.

1885
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,020
It's like 18 hundreds.

1886
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:09,310
It's almost to me like we're not 
supposed to get old enough to see the 

1887
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:09,920
hustle.
Right?

1888
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:14,930
It's almost like we're.
We're designed to die off right?

1889
01:30:14,931 --> 01:30:15,890
When we start going,
what?

1890
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:17,990
Wait a minute,
what the fuck are we doing?

1891
01:30:17,991 --> 01:30:18,270
Hey,
hey,

1892
01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:18,780
hey,
hey.

1893
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,840
Everybody settled down.
What do we.

1894
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:24,880
What exactly are we doing here?
But that's when we were supposed to 

1895
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:24,880
heart failure.
That's what,

1896
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,900
that's what it should supposed to quit.
But we're,

1897
01:30:26,901 --> 01:30:30,920
we're alive so much longer now because 
of nutrition and medicine and people are

1898
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:32,690
just,
they're more,

1899
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:38,690
they're more conscious.
A first person like yourself has more 

1900
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:39,740
free time as well and more free time to 
contemplate,

1901
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:44,770
and you're in a nonconformist occupation
where you're not constantly pressured 

1902
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:49,331
every day to thinking along certain 
lines because as a real issue with the 

1903
01:30:49,331 --> 01:30:53,141
American worker,
you think you're given eight hours a 

1904
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:53,141
day,
but you're not given eight hours a day.

1905
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:56,060
You're given eight hours a day,
plus your behavior outside of work can't

1906
01:30:56,061 --> 01:31:01,061
get much too crazy in comparison to your
behavior inside of work or it's gonna 

1907
01:31:01,061 --> 01:31:06,020
Affect your performance at work.
You can't be partying too much and 

1908
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:08,741
coming into work hung over,
so the whole thing must be regulated so 

1909
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:12,491
everybody has to stay in La.
You can get crazy and say sexist jokes 

1910
01:31:12,491 --> 01:31:14,810
around female coworkers or you'll go to 
jail.

1911
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:16,220
All right,
you'll be arrested.

1912
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:21,320
You.
You'll lose money because of sexual 

1913
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:21,320
harassment.
You know if you fire her,

1914
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:21,320
you,
you,

1915
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:24,440
you're going to get sued and these are 
all that.

1916
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:28,550
This is all like an impossible thing to 
avoid.

1917
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:31,100
If you're not a normal person working a 
normal job,

1918
01:31:31,101 --> 01:31:36,101
it's impossible for you to avoid your 
behavior being altered just so that you 

1919
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:36,950
can work

1920
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:37,440
well.
Yeah,

1921
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:42,240
you're you heirs the game.
If people forgot they were playing.

1922
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,870
It's called Western society and most 
people,

1923
01:31:45,871 --> 01:31:48,210
the way they play that game is they have
to.

1924
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:51,900
There's different roles they take.
There's the worker in the boss,

1925
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:57,320
there's the executive as the president 
police officers,

1926
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,810
and it's all a game.
When you go and buy,

1927
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,190
buy a starbucks.
I learned this.

1928
01:32:03,191 --> 01:32:07,540
There's a really cool meditative 
technique you can do that's part of this

1929
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,640
stuff,
this guy gurdjieff talks about,

1930
01:32:09,641 --> 01:32:14,641
but it's basically shows you how you're 
essentially just a series of automatic 

1931
01:32:14,641 --> 01:32:15,310
functions throughout the day.
You're not even there,

1932
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,650
but at what you do is when you go to buy
something,

1933
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,100
just be aware of the way you buy 
something.

1934
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:23,050
Watch the way your hand gets your 
wallet.

1935
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,850
Watch the way the money or the card 
comes out.

1936
01:32:24,851 --> 01:32:27,270
Watch the way you swipe the card,
watch the way you talk to the person and

1937
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:32,271
watch the way the person talks to you 
and what you'll see happening is 

1938
01:32:32,271 --> 01:32:35,851
something you've been doing for years 
and years and years and years and years 

1939
01:32:35,851 --> 01:32:38,850
and years,
over and over and over again to buying 

1940
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:38,850
shit because you live in America and 
that's how he fucking survive.

1941
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:43,650
It's buying shit at the cash register.
It's a just a great way to see how when 

1942
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:47,611
you do that,
your body goes into this automated 

1943
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:47,611
function.
Get the wall,

1944
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:47,611
pull the card,
say thanks in a weird way.

1945
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:52,501
Look at the person.
If you look at the person you're seeing 

1946
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:52,501
an Automaton,
you're seeing a person who has put their

1947
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:57,450
consciousness on the shelf,
why they like all day long process 

1948
01:32:57,450 --> 01:32:57,450
people's cards,
process people cards.

1949
01:32:57,450 --> 01:33:01,891
So what you're seeing is two machines 
having this interaction and it's really 

1950
01:33:01,891 --> 01:33:05,230
fucking a great exercise to do because 
what you're seeing is a game that you've

1951
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:07,720
been playing so long you've forgotten 
you've.

1952
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,960
You're playing that game.
You learned out a bit pot by shit at a 

1953
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,660
cash register.
There was a time when you'd never bought

1954
01:33:13,661 --> 01:33:18,661
something at the cash register when you 
were a kid and then your parents taught 

1955
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:18,661
you how to do it.

1956
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:20,650
You learned how to exchange money for 
goods and that crystallized,

1957
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:23,830
do this ritual that you don't even know 
as a ritual.

1958
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:28,831
It's just this automatic thing,
so this fucking game of Western society.

1959
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:34,410
It invites people to become automatons 
to get through the day when you're like,

1960
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:39,720
I used to wash dishes at applebee's and 
I can remember like the way that you 

1961
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:45,001
would get through the day of washing 
dishes is you just go into this 

1962
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:45,130
automatic trans.
She's a trans,

1963
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:46,890
spray the dish,
but in thing wash,

1964
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,800
scrub up,
put it in anything.

1965
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:50,560
It's just an automatic trance.
You're there,

1966
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,770
but you're not really there.
You're just in a trance and you do it as

1967
01:33:53,771 --> 01:33:57,220
an escape from the monotony and dullness
of the job.

1968
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:02,340
Well,
it should be one person is cleaning 

1969
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:02,860
their own plate.
That's what it should be,

1970
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:03,940
right?
It shouldn't be.

1971
01:34:03,941 --> 01:34:07,090
There's a giant stack of plates in 
someone's job.

1972
01:34:07,091 --> 01:34:09,820
It is to clean those things because 
that's when things start to suck.

1973
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:15,060
That's when jobs start to suck,
when you're doing all this shit for 

1974
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:18,451
money that no one wants to do.
There's a big difference between that 

1975
01:34:18,451 --> 01:34:22,111
kind of a job and the kind of a job 
where you actually have a career and do 

1976
01:34:22,111 --> 01:34:24,100
things you enjoy like you and you get 
paid to be a professional comedian.

1977
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:24,780
Yeah,
that's a,

1978
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:25,960
that's A.
I mean,

1979
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
it's not even,
it shouldn't even be classified as a 

1980
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:31,000
job.
Yeah.

1981
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,450
It doesn't feel like it.
And call it a career if you want to get 

1982
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:34,450
pretentious,
but you know,

1983
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:34,450
it's your thing.

1984
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:35,980
The career thing is a horrible word,
man.

1985
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:38,470
It's a weird word because it makes you 
feel like,

1986
01:34:38,471 --> 01:34:42,040
you know,
I'm fucking serious grindstone.

1987
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:45,550
But it's the,
it's comes the derivation of the word is

1988
01:34:45,551 --> 01:34:49,000
a track.
Horses ran on really circle.

1989
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:51,100
You'd never get anywhere.
You just run into fucking circle.

1990
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:55,340
That's what a career is.
I'm working on my career.

1991
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,070
Like the,
the,

1992
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,490
the um,
yeah.

1993
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,610
I think that I feel very lucky.
I feel incredibly lucky.

1994
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:03,080
And also I feel like,
uh,

1995
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,720
always on the precipice of absolute 
disaster.

1996
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:10,721
There's something really quite a,
a peaceful about having a regular 

1997
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:11,540
paycheck.
Man,

1998
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:13,040
there's something really nice about 
that.

1999
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:18,041
That's fucking cool to now.
Every two weeks you're getting a 

2000
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:18,041
paycheck.
That's bad ass,

2001
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:20,510
so that life of working a job and having
a regular job,

2002
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:22,430
it is.
There's sweetness to it,

2003
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:27,431
man,
and it facilitates having babies and it 

2004
01:35:27,431 --> 01:35:29,771
facilitates a lot of aspects of life 
that I think are quite pleasurable on a 

2005
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:34,220
really high level,
so I totally get it.

2006
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:35,630
It's just a,
you know,

2007
01:35:35,631 --> 01:35:40,631
is there a way that this process that 
we're all engaged in this gigantic game 

2008
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:47,411
that we're all in this crazy dance of 
Western civilization that we're all 

2009
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:51,821
engaged in.
Is there a way that we can take it up a 

2010
01:35:51,821 --> 01:35:54,101
level?
Is there a way we can make it a little 

2011
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:54,830
more aware of itself?
A little more cognizant of itself,

2012
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:58,120
a little less embedded in superstition,
and

2013
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:03,370
again,
I've got to go to what I said before is 

2014
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:06,020
that I think that things are evolving.
You just are not happy with the pace.

2015
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:11,350
I think that we live in such a tiny 
frame as tiny window of time and the 

2016
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:18,851
amount of progress that we're looking at
just from a thousand years to now is 

2017
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:23,180
monumental 2000 years to now and human 
behavior,

2018
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:26,960
knowledge and access to information off 
the charts,

2019
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:31,790
how much it's progress and we're just 
caught in the middle of it and it's key.

2020
01:36:31,791 --> 01:36:36,791
It's not going to stop with with the 
Internet and with the the access to 

2021
01:36:36,801 --> 01:36:39,650
information that's available now and the
ability to communicate now.

2022
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:43,580
Truth is getting through more often than
not.

2023
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:48,940
Truth is piling on.
There's a lot of bullshit out there 

2024
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:51,731
still,
but it's way easier to cut the bullshit 

2025
01:36:51,731 --> 01:36:52,790
off with the Internet.
It's evolving.

2026
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:56,480
It's just not evolving up to your speed,
the what you would like to see,

2027
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:01,750
but just look at the way people think,
act and behave now as composed as 

2028
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:06,881
compared to the way they did turn truck.
There's no question and that's not even 

2029
01:37:06,881 --> 01:37:08,960
a blink of an eye.
Not even a blink of an eye.

2030
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:12,170
It's unquestionably moving in a certain 
direction and yeah,

2031
01:37:12,171 --> 01:37:17,030
it's quagmired in greed and built on a 
foundation of unfixable bullshit,

2032
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:22,240
but it still spiraling towards the 
technological singularity question about

2033
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:24,770
it.

2034
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:29,780
Some of the advancements that you're 
talking about are some of the things 

2035
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:29,780
that you're like,
wow,

2036
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:32,811
things have really advanced.
It's because groups of people made 

2037
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:35,900
active efforts to push against the and 
a,

2038
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:37,290
the anti evolutionary for

2039
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:42,390
sure.
I mean that's their role in this 

2040
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,390
machine.
That's their role in this,

2041
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,390
this process,
this,

2042
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,610
the,
you know,

2043
01:37:42,611 --> 01:37:43,720
their,
their role is to,

2044
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:45,870
to push things in that manner.
No,

2045
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:50,910
I mean I think it's all an ingredient in
a gigantic metaphysical sort of a soup 

2046
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:57,420
and it's all piled in together there and
know when everyone's doing their little 

2047
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,820
part,
but it's changing slow for our,

2048
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:02,190
our ideas and our tastes.
But in,

2049
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:07,400
as you know,
in compared to history that the rapid 

2050
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,120
pace of evolution and the evolution of 
progress,

2051
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:14,480
the complexification of our society,
it's blowing up in our face.

2052
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:18,390
We're hanging on tooth and nail.
Literally,

2053
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:23,750
you know,
there's a lot of people that still have 

2054
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:26,011
even grasped how much it's changed.
That's why when you have all these Wacko

2055
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:27,870
Gay Republican dudes,
they get busted online,

2056
01:38:27,871 --> 01:38:29,280
getting hookers,
you know,

2057
01:38:29,281 --> 01:38:31,770
getting male hookers like this new guy 
that just got caught.

2058
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:34,050
Somebody just sent it to me on twitter.
I don't know his fucking name,

2059
01:38:34,051 --> 01:38:39,051
but you know the story.
The story just keeps happening over and 

2060
01:38:39,051 --> 01:38:39,051
over again.
The same goddamn story.

2061
01:38:39,051 --> 01:38:43,430
This guy wanted to pay some dude to have
sex with him and he got caught with it 

2062
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:45,210
and it's fascinating.
It's fascinating shit.

2063
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:51,350
Human animals,
a very strange mixture of complex 

2064
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:57,680
thinking and awareness and then some 
just wild monkey jealousy and instincts 

2065
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:07,041
and fears and it's all piled together in
this weird fucking biological machine 

2066
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:13,611
and it just like God figure this out.
We've got a bunch of things pulling you 

2067
01:39:13,611 --> 01:39:14,160
a bunch of different directions and a 
lot of eyes are on you.

2068
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:19,430
Good luck and just get pushed out there 
and try to find things to sustain the 

2069
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:23,991
body while the mind searches for answers
and likeminded people to hang with in 

2070
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:26,880
order to compare idea so you don't feel 
like you're crazy.

2071
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,890
You don't feel like you're the only 
person out there.

2072
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:31,500
On the beach howling at the moon saying,
what the fuck is this?

2073
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:36,590
Somebody please make sense of this shit.
Somebody is there anybody out there in 

2074
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,000
the Internet now you can send that 
fucking message in a bottle and someone 

2075
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:42,210
answers,
dude right here,

2076
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:45,420
WTF?
What the fuck?

2077
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:47,790
What's going on?
What's happening?

2078
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:50,070
And everybody gets together and that's 
the hive mind.

2079
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:55,370
That's how the mind really thickens.
That's how things really start getting 

2080
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,340
connected to happening.
Right now.

2081
01:39:56,820 --> 01:40:01,470
It's only we're only dealing with a two 
decade old invention.

2082
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:06,650
Two decades is a fucking a fraction of 
the time it takes for your eyes to 

2083
01:40:06,911 --> 01:40:07,540
close,

2084
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:13,130
but how about when?
Not only does it get a grip of people 

2085
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:13,130
being like,
what the fuck?

2086
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:18,140
How about,
how about when it brings groups of 

2087
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,740
people into the streets and overthrows 
governments like in Egypt.

2088
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,750
I mean it doesn't just stop with

2089
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:27,290
how about the UK?
One of the things that we're trying to 

2090
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:29,781
do,
they want to shut down twitter and 

2091
01:40:29,781 --> 01:40:31,401
facebook over there because that's how 
people were communicating this bart 

2092
01:40:31,401 --> 01:40:33,180
thing that happened at San Francisco to 
shut down the fucking cell phones.

2093
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:35,650
They didn't want people organizing.
Yeah,

2094
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:36,870
it's crazy,
man.

2095
01:40:36,871 --> 01:40:39,330
I like that kind of shit is like,
listen man,

2096
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,340
you can't do that.
You can't.

2097
01:40:41,341 --> 01:40:43,020
You're not allowed to shut off the 
phones.

2098
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,420
What if someone's fucking mother was 
dying?

2099
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:50,690
What if someone got hit by a car but you
couldn't call fucking ambulance because 

2100
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:54,010
you can't use your phone because you 
assholes are afraid of criticism because

2101
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:59,060
you assholes are afraid of people 
yelling and screaming and telling you 

2102
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:00,010
that you fucked up so you cut off the 
phone lines.

2103
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,730
You should go to jail.
You should go to jail.

2104
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:08,820
If you shut off the phones in America in
2011 to avoid a protest,

2105
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:14,070
fuck you.
That's ridiculous for you to say that 

2106
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:18,541
you want to maintain order so badly,
you will cut off communication between 

2107
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:24,570
everyone.
Tax payers with good people that have 

2108
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:26,710
done no wrong without a single spot on 
their record.

2109
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:30,100
You deny them use of the phone to 
blanketly.

2110
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,390
Fuck you.

2111
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,280
You know what they said?
What?

2112
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:36,040
Humans have American,
have a right to free speech,

2113
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,280
but they also have a right to get to 
where they want to go on time.

2114
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,300
Yeah.
Well,

2115
01:41:40,301 --> 01:41:41,740
how about if someone's dying suit?

2116
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:43,180
No,
I think it's the worst.

2117
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:44,680
I think it's a,
it's fucking.

2118
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:47,260
So it's,
to me it's scary.

2119
01:41:47,261 --> 01:41:48,580
It's terrifying,
terrifying,

2120
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:50,290
terrifying.
It's scary because it's like,

2121
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,400
which you're supposed to do is you're 
going to have to hire more cops,

2122
01:41:52,401 --> 01:41:53,750
stupid.
And you gonna have to,

2123
01:41:53,751 --> 01:41:55,580
you know,
keep peace in a,

2124
01:41:55,581 --> 01:41:57,860
in a very respectful manner.
And you know,

2125
01:41:57,861 --> 01:41:58,490
there's a,
there's a,

2126
01:41:58,491 --> 01:42:02,570
there's a whole fucking bad history 
which we cops and people up there,

2127
01:42:02,571 --> 01:42:03,620
man.
And you know,

2128
01:42:03,621 --> 01:42:06,290
I'm not saying that the cops are 100 
percent in the wrong,

2129
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,960
but there's been some shit they did.
That's crazy.

2130
01:42:08,961 --> 01:42:13,961
Like the cop that shot the guy because 
he thought it was tasering him instead 

2131
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,410
he shot them and it's all on video.
I mean look what the fuck,

2132
01:42:15,411 --> 01:42:20,411
man.
There's been a lot of nonsense like 

2133
01:42:20,411 --> 01:42:22,331
that.
And just when you shut the fucking 

2134
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:22,331
phones off and keep people from 
protesting,

2135
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:22,920
people just got to go,
what,

2136
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:24,650
what,
what the fuck are you doing?

2137
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:26,510
And who the fuck are you?

2138
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:31,570
That's why it's so incredible what 
anonymous did by creating a protest that

2139
01:42:32,331 --> 01:42:37,040
got broadcast nationally to every 
internationally people saw that shit.

2140
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:39,230
And,
and if they hadn't have done that,

2141
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:43,130
if they'd been content with just having 
conversations about it,

2142
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:46,140
it wouldn't have escalated to the level 
that it is escalated to.

2143
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:51,180
And a lot of those guys got arrested.
Like they put freedom of information in 

2144
01:42:51,981 --> 01:42:55,460
front of their own freedom.
That is heroic.

2145
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:58,010
That's bad ass.
That's what I'm talking about.

2146
01:42:58,011 --> 01:43:03,011
I'm saying at some point you people have
got to like stand up because if you 

2147
01:43:03,531 --> 01:43:05,600
don't.
If no one had stood up,

2148
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:07,340
no one had done that.
If there'd been no protests,

2149
01:43:07,341 --> 01:43:12,341
if Bart didn't know that every time they
tried to shut the fucking phone lines 

2150
01:43:12,341 --> 01:43:12,530
down,
they're gonna get swarmed.

2151
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:14,360
Was the,
what was the protest over,

2152
01:43:14,361 --> 01:43:16,080
do you know?
I don't know that it was.

2153
01:43:16,370 --> 01:43:21,370
They were putting the,
the anonymous protest was after another 

2154
01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:24,881
protest that happened.
And I do not know why the first protest 

2155
01:43:24,881 --> 01:43:24,881
happened.
I just know they shut the fuck up.

2156
01:43:24,881 --> 01:43:26,940
Did it have to do with that guy who was 
murdered?

2157
01:43:26,941 --> 01:43:29,410
I think that the guys getting out of 
jail a column,

2158
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:34,540
maybe I might be completely different.
That's what I thought the whole thing 

2159
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:39,210
was about the time.
It's just so satisfying the world.

2160
01:43:39,230 --> 01:43:44,230
And when you think about that,
someone lost their life because of 

2161
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:46,320
something so fucking stupid.
And then the guy who did it,

2162
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:51,000
the one fucking stupid mistake,
his life is fucked forever too.

2163
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,000
Yeah.
He's got to deal with that for the rest.

2164
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,150
I mean,
can you imagine what it is?

2165
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:57,800
How stupid you must feel to make that 
mistake.

2166
01:43:58,670 --> 01:44:00,500
You're so panicked.
You thought you had your Taser,

2167
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:02,030
but you had your gun and you shot the 
guy.

2168
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:04,080
That weight of that.
Think of the weight of that.

2169
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:05,730
I always think about that,
the weight,

2170
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:09,690
because it's like when you fuck over a 
friend or if you do something stupid,

2171
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,910
eventually you can say,
I'm sorry.

2172
01:44:11,911 --> 01:44:14,790
That was stupid.
You can apologize and you can get it off

2173
01:44:14,791 --> 01:44:17,400
your chest when you kill somebody.
You can't do it.

2174
01:44:17,401 --> 01:44:19,650
You can apologize.
Someone back to live.

2175
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:24,870
There's nothing you can do.
You can say you're sorry to their 

2176
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:24,870
family,
but that's not going to bring the person

2177
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:27,960
back.
It's so terrible.

2178
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:30,610
Yeah,
it's pretty crazy idea.

2179
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,670
We're so connected to each other.
What?

2180
01:44:33,671 --> 01:44:36,730
You lose someone in your life so,
so painful.

2181
01:44:37,870 --> 01:44:40,690
The idea that other people can take 
people away from people.

2182
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:45,990
That's like the ultimate attack on them.
So strange because we all know are 

2183
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:48,700
temporary.
We all know we're going to die.

2184
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:51,580
We just don't want to right now.
I'm not ready yet.

2185
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:55,600
Now I'm moving too much fun.
I'm enjoying this.

2186
01:44:55,601 --> 01:44:57,970
I'm just.
I'm just getting this thing mastered.

2187
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:00,250
I'm just getting it figured out.
I know how to enjoy it.

2188
01:45:00,251 --> 01:45:02,170
Now.
I figured it out.

2189
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:03,940
I figured out how to enjoy.
Don't let me die yet.

2190
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:05,050
No,
not yet.

2191
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,540
Sorry.
Mr Rogen.

2192
01:45:06,541 --> 01:45:08,520
We've got to move you onto the next 
experiment.

2193
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,380
You can't stay here.
That's,

2194
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:11,400
you know,
that's like.

2195
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:14,220
Maybe that's all it is.
It's like when they give like the planet

2196
01:45:14,221 --> 01:45:16,440
of the Apes,
you know when they have that,

2197
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:19,940
the spoiler alert,
your fingers in your ears don't do it.

2198
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:25,310
It's not that bad.
I can talk about the tests that they 

2199
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:25,310
did.
Right.

2200
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:25,310
Can I talk about it?

2201
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:25,710
Talk about the plot is probably not 
smart.

2202
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:26,820
That's rude.

2203
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:28,510
Okay.
So forget planet of the apes.

2204
01:45:29,110 --> 01:45:34,110
But sometimes the kids you give them 
like intelligence tests where they have 

2205
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:35,130
to like do like certain things you know 
and,

2206
01:45:35,131 --> 01:45:38,020
and imagine if that's what this whole 
thing is,

2207
01:45:38,350 --> 01:45:43,000
some kind of alien intelligence tests 
where after you solve the puzzle,

2208
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:47,370
you get moved along and the way it looks
when you get moved along is you,

2209
01:45:47,371 --> 01:45:49,930
you're gone day taking a bullet in the 
chest or your,

2210
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:50,710
you know,
your,

2211
01:45:50,711 --> 01:45:55,711
some,
you're someone who just like maybe you 

2212
01:45:55,711 --> 01:45:57,661
just have a heart attack.
Like sometimes I've thought I wonder if 

2213
01:45:57,661 --> 01:46:01,021
there's like a thought you can have or a
place you can get to where you just get 

2214
01:46:01,361 --> 01:46:04,300
it to the point where you don't have to 
stick around here.

2215
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:09,450
Like they say that some yogis through 
meditation have just like meditated and 

2216
01:46:10,001 --> 01:46:12,520
meditated and they can willfully just 
leave their body.

2217
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:17,760
They call it dropping your body.
They don't call it death dropping your 

2218
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:17,760
body.

2219
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,540
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't put that past the realm of 

2220
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,911
possibility.
Have you considered the fact that your 

2221
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:26,981
brain,
we know produces a bunch of different 

2222
01:46:26,981 --> 01:46:29,201
psychedelic chemicals?
Who's to say that it's not some way to 

2223
01:46:29,201 --> 01:46:30,110
trigger those are not the way it is.
Some way to stimulate those,

2224
01:46:30,111 --> 01:46:35,111
but putting yourself into a frequency 
through meditation where you force the 

2225
01:46:35,111 --> 01:46:39,011
brain to accept a certain vibe,
a certain just a certain frequency,

2226
01:46:39,201 --> 01:46:44,201
and in doing so you can actually force 
your brain into producing certain 

2227
01:46:44,201 --> 01:46:46,790
chemicals and then you'd fucking blast 
off in the brain.

2228
01:46:46,791 --> 01:46:49,470
Makes psychedelics fact,
fact.

2229
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:49,980
The human

2230
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,160
body makes psychedelics fact.
We know it does.

2231
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,870
It makes a bunch of things that affect 
your behavior.

2232
01:46:54,871 --> 01:46:56,560
It makes adrenaline,
makes dopamine,

2233
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:01,710
Serotonin,
so all these different things that 

2234
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:04,050
oxytocin.
There's all sorts of things that 

2235
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:04,050
stimulate you,
affect you,

2236
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,790
and we know it makes all the crazy 
chemicals that exist,

2237
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:10,800
that create the dream state kind of been
taking this Fuckin Alpha brain shit and 

2238
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,030
having the nuttiest dreams.
Man and I had a werewolf,

2239
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:17,570
gorilla sex dream.
It was the strangest fucking dream of 

2240
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:22,041
all time.
It was so bizarre because it was so 

2241
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:24,411
stupid,
but so real and so easy to recall this,

2242
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:26,970
these,
these Alpha brain things.

2243
01:47:26,971 --> 01:47:29,120
Man.
One of the things that a bunch of people

2244
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,110
tweeted me about this too,
that when you,

2245
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:36,111
uh,
when you take them and have dreams for 

2246
01:47:36,111 --> 01:47:36,111
whatever reason,
you're fucking,

2247
01:47:36,111 --> 01:47:36,750
you remember your dreams,
you know,

2248
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:40,140
and um,
this dream was so stupid.

2249
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:45,400
It was a gorilla and he was right behind
like a bulging and breaking piece of 

2250
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:45,960
wallboard.
You know,

2251
01:47:45,961 --> 01:47:49,200
that white plaster.
And I had a squirt the,

2252
01:47:49,201 --> 01:47:49,950
uh,
the,

2253
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:50,590
the,
the,

2254
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,920
the fucking stuff to put them to sleep 
through it.

2255
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,680
I couldn't go and get to him that I had 
to run away and hide.

2256
01:47:55,681 --> 01:48:00,681
And he ran into a werewolf and they 
fucking fought and then started sucking 

2257
01:48:00,681 --> 01:48:03,591
each other's cocks.
Was the most ridiculous dream ever.

2258
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,940
I'm not reasonable.
I Dunno what the fuck it means,

2259
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:11,060
but there's Werewolf was on top sucking 
this gorillas cock and there were like 

2260
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:11,950
69 and I was like,
what kind?

2261
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:15,050
I've never had a dream like that before.
Where I was.

2262
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:19,200
He looked into dream dictionary doesn't 
exist.

2263
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:21,570
You are Joe Rogan.
Yeah,

2264
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:22,710
it was.
It was so crazy.

2265
01:48:22,711 --> 01:48:27,690
It was like going from an absolute 
terror and fear like there was these,

2266
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:32,720
these gorillas were these giant silver 
backs and they were right behind this 

2267
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:37,110
thin piece of wallboard and I had to 
inject them with this,

2268
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:38,010
the sedative.

2269
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:43,070
I had to get them with it and I couldn't
quite get to them and I pulled it out 

2270
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:46,970
and he came through the wall and I ran 
as I ran out and then he runs into the 

2271
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:47,130
little girl.
It was just,

2272
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:51,300
it went from 69 became completely 
ridiculous.

2273
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:56,450
Not only that,
but the way they looked became 

2274
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:59,301
completely ridiculous.
They went from being like a terrifying 

2275
01:48:59,301 --> 01:49:02,841
looking silver back gorilla to some sort
of curious George halfway into,

2276
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:07,680
you know,
goofy looking like smiling gorilla,

2277
01:49:07,681 --> 01:49:10,150
getting his dick sucked by a Werewolf,
you know?

2278
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:14,070
It became completely cartoonish.
It was so strange.

2279
01:49:14,071 --> 01:49:19,071
I was like,
I can't even wrap my head around how 

2280
01:49:19,071 --> 01:49:21,771
anybody would try to describe,
how are you going to tell me what's 

2281
01:49:21,771 --> 01:49:22,620
going on in my head?
That's how are you going to,

2282
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:25,830
to when it,
everything became a big gay joke.

2283
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:31,030
It's like you're running from,
you're running from a terrifying 

2284
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:34,880
superior physical specimen in a giant 
silver back gorilla that you're trying 

2285
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:39,261
to sedate through a wall with a needle 
and then you run away and then a 

2286
01:49:39,261 --> 01:49:43,640
werewolf turns a corner and smashes into
the grill and then they start blowing 

2287
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:44,210
each other the fuck man.

2288
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,800
Better get.
Do you do believe in those dream books

2289
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,860
that's not in there?
I don't believe it.

2290
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:53,400
That's in a dream book.
I'll and I'll tell you what,

2291
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,770
God,
I'm fucking straight as they come.

2292
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,870
That's not,
that's not what this is about.

2293
01:49:58,190 --> 01:50:02,100
Um,
I am just a not responsible for a lot of

2294
01:50:02,101 --> 01:50:04,380
the thoughts that spin around in my 
imagination.

2295
01:50:04,381 --> 01:50:06,360
Sometimes.
I really don't believe I am.

2296
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,500
I think,
I mean,

2297
01:50:07,501 --> 01:50:10,230
it's not that I was thinking that this 
was a real thing.

2298
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,620
It was like my brain just created the 
stupidest idea for them

2299
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:17,310
movie in the middle of a horrifying 
scenario scenario.

2300
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,870
Like now,
did you join into the,

2301
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:25,190
into the monkeys at all?
Did you start having sex with them or 

2302
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:29,460
trying to get away?
I was trying to get away and they were 

2303
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:29,460
just blowing each other.
Oh wait,

2304
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:29,460
no escape.
Yeah,

2305
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,610
yeah.
They started blowing each other and then

2306
01:50:30,611 --> 01:50:31,000
I said,
okay,

2307
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:33,850
I can get outta here.
But it became like cartoon.

2308
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:37,650
Should you walk away slow like watching 
the whole time here.

2309
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:40,640
I tiptoed so it didn't shock them,
you know,

2310
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:43,490
I feel like if you move too fast they 
can't help but chase,

2311
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:43,750
you

2312
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:48,610
roll a ball of yarn past a kitten,
they run after it.

2313
01:50:48,611 --> 01:50:50,770
They can't help themselves.
It's just instinctual.

2314
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:52,960
They say that's what also happens with 
bikers,

2315
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:58,080
mountain bikers and mountain lions.
Sometimes mountain lions is see them 

2316
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:58,080
moving fast and they literally can't 
help themselves.

2317
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,090
They just chase after him.
Right?

2318
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:00,640
So you want to make sure you don't do 
that.

2319
01:51:00,641 --> 01:51:02,590
So I walked away real slow and they were
blowing each other.

2320
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:03,800
So there you go.
You guys.

2321
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,240
There's a survival tip.
Yeah.

2322
01:51:07,241 --> 01:51:12,241
If you ever come upon a werewolf 
allowing a gorilla gorilla sucking each 

2323
01:51:12,241 --> 01:51:13,550
other's cocks.
Same.

2324
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:15,400
Yeah.
What the fuck is that?

2325
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,720
Good luck,
Freud.

2326
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,000
Good luck.
Disecting that memory or that,

2327
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:20,230
uh,
that idea.

2328
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:22,270
But the weird thing is that it was so 
vivid.

2329
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:24,180
These pills,
for whatever reason,

2330
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:26,500
give you these incredibly vivid dreams.
What,

2331
01:51:26,501 --> 01:51:27,720
um,
what's in them?

2332
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:29,500
Good question.
I should probably know,

2333
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:31,090
right?
Telling everybody to take them.

2334
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,990
It's a supposedly a everything.
There's,

2335
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:38,080
there's a on on it.com,
o n n I t dangerous,

2336
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,610
or Aubrey as he says.
Would you say Angel Eyes?

2337
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:45,680
Yeah.
People keep on saying there's Angel 

2338
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:45,680
Angel Eyes.
What does that mean?

2339
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:46,890
It is that stuff that you give to dogs.
So when they,

2340
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:49,010
they tear it makes it,
you know,

2341
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,540
when dog cries,
it gets black underneath their eyes.

2342
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:54,540
Angel Eyes is something that you put in 
their food when they eat,

2343
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:59,541
so it doesn't.
It takes that away and people on online 

2344
01:51:59,541 --> 01:51:59,541
is like,
does it have angel was.

2345
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:05,150
I've never knew that there was something
like people are going to serve with 

2346
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:05,150
their dogs tiers.

2347
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:09,850
Yeah.
When you get like a white dog and it's 

2348
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:09,850
really spraying that yellow shit out.
Looks like,

2349
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,150
but what the fuck are you doing to the 
dog?

2350
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:13,680
What does that mean?
They're protein.

2351
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:16,120
It's like a too much zinc or something 
weird like that.

2352
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:18,540
So it's just sort of holistic.
Yeah.

2353
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:20,100
Okay.
Okay.

2354
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:22,870
Where the fuck are we talking about 
before?

2355
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:27,210
Angel eyes are telling him about it.
60 nine werewolf gorilla did do other.

2356
01:52:27,211 --> 01:52:30,720
Begin from that to Angel Eyes.
You're talking about the brain stuff,

2357
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:32,190
the pills,
the brain pills.

2358
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:34,170
Who knows what they're doing to us.
Your.

2359
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:36,420
Yeah.
Your sales pitch for the pills.

2360
01:52:36,421 --> 01:52:37,830
I think we got to work on it a little 
bit.

2361
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:39,050
Working on it.

2362
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,040
No,
I'm not selling it.

2363
01:52:40,190 --> 01:52:42,470
This is what I'm telling you this.
This is what I've decided to do.

2364
01:52:42,471 --> 01:52:45,470
I'm just going to be totally honest with
how I feel them.

2365
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,840
That's my.
I'm going to give my pr.

2366
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:49,310
I'm not a doctor.
Obviously,

2367
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:51,740
if you're listening to any medical 
advice I'd give you.

2368
01:52:51,741 --> 01:52:56,741
You're a silly person.
There's plenty of valid sources on the 

2369
01:52:56,741 --> 01:52:59,381
Internet,
but I am a person with an objective 

2370
01:52:59,381 --> 01:53:02,141
experience and what I'll do is I'll take
these fucking pills and I'll tell you 

2371
01:53:02,141 --> 01:53:04,160
what I feel like and what I feel like 
right now is I feel like they make.

2372
01:53:04,161 --> 01:53:08,330
My mind feels clearer and clearer is a 
very subjective term obviously,

2373
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:13,480
but I feel like I have more energy,
but it doesn't feel like a run on sort 

2374
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:16,790
of a spiky caffeine energy.
It feels like it.

2375
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:21,770
I hate the word crisp and cleaner,
but that's for lack of better word.

2376
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,270
Enough of energy.
Yeah.

2377
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,220
It does something good,
man.

2378
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:30,221
I,
I enjoy it and it gives me very 

2379
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:32,291
memorable dreams.
Not all of them involving gorillas and 

2380
01:53:32,291 --> 01:53:32,291
wearable.

2381
01:53:32,291 --> 01:53:35,490
If some of them been weird.
People dreams have some science fiction 

2382
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:35,660
dreams.
You know,

2383
01:53:35,661 --> 01:53:37,370
I've had some.
I've had some crazy ones.

2384
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:43,360
I had this crazy dream about a world 
with a thousand Nikola Tesla's that 

2385
01:53:44,211 --> 01:53:47,310
instead of just one super genius 
oddball,

2386
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:48,930
crazy man like tesla,
this,

2387
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:54,040
it was like a subsect of the species and
it was like a thousand of them and they 

2388
01:53:54,711 --> 01:53:59,711
just in a matter of a few years time had
these giant metal floating ships all 

2389
01:54:01,191 --> 01:54:06,191
throughout cities and everything was run
through wireless electricity and this 

2390
01:54:06,191 --> 01:54:08,840
was me somehow or another in the 19 
fifties,

2391
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:13,960
this 1000 teslas had moved society so 
rapidly before anybody could even 

2392
01:54:14,631 --> 01:54:17,060
control it because they were so far 
advanced.

2393
01:54:17,061 --> 01:54:20,150
It was like a thousand of them 
altogether creating all this shit.

2394
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,890
And in the 19 fifties there was flying 
ships and you know,

2395
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:28,960
there was a type of electronic 
connectivity that was very similar to 

2396
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:29,330
the way we're doing it now,
but different.

2397
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:34,680
It was just everyone could talk to 
people from these handsets that we're 

2398
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:35,030
all throughout the city.
Like there were,

2399
01:54:35,031 --> 01:54:35,870
there were,
there were,

2400
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:38,030
you know,
everyone was congested at this one place

2401
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:41,360
and you could move to any handset and 
constantly be contacting people.

2402
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,890
It's very trippy,
man.

2403
01:54:42,891 --> 01:54:46,430
It was really weird because it was like 
19 fifties aesthetic,

2404
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:51,670
like the way people dress and you know,
a man going to work with a leather 

2405
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:51,670
briefcase and you know,
and,

2406
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:53,270
and,
and even like the certain type of hats,

2407
01:54:53,271 --> 01:54:54,530
they would wear it with their glasses 
on.

2408
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:59,531
Father knows best for me.
Mother is flying metal ships and no 

2409
01:54:59,531 --> 01:55:03,670
electricity in the air.
Now Tesla wanted to broadcast 

2410
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:04,310
electricity.
He wanted it to be like,

2411
01:55:04,311 --> 01:55:09,311
well,
radio signals and have it just fly 

2412
01:55:09,311 --> 01:55:09,740
through the air.
But then anybody could just like radio,

2413
01:55:09,741 --> 01:55:11,660
just all you need is a receiver to take 
it.

2414
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:13,400
There was no fucking money in that.

2415
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:14,880
Yeah,
that's right.

2416
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:19,910
Yeah.
He had a lot of shit that he invented 

2417
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:19,910
that,
that,

2418
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:23,480
you know,
they took away his trunks that all his 

2419
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:23,480
writing.
Yeah.

2420
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:25,160
It's Kinda fascinating.
Fascinating dude.

2421
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:30,161
But in this crazy dream,
the dream like almost had a title of a 

2422
01:55:30,161 --> 01:55:31,700
thousand Teslas has it.
There was all these little crazy looking

2423
01:55:31,701 --> 01:55:34,610
dudes,
eccentric looking super geniuses running

2424
01:55:34,611 --> 01:55:39,611
around all together.
Like if I was creating all this nutty 

2425
01:55:39,611 --> 01:55:40,040
shit and no one could keep up with what 
the effects,

2426
01:55:40,041 --> 01:55:43,350
it was just,
it was nothing like the slower pace that

2427
01:55:43,351 --> 01:55:44,700
we've had to endure over,
you know,

2428
01:55:44,710 --> 01:55:49,710
and really,
and you think about an extra half of a 

2429
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:52,371
century and shit,
it's really not that much time ever to 

2430
01:55:52,371 --> 01:55:52,371
have all this,
uh,

2431
01:55:52,371 --> 01:55:56,630
new technology together.
But if at all burst together in the 19 

2432
01:55:56,630 --> 01:55:56,630
fifties,
if we had every,

2433
01:55:56,630 --> 01:55:59,910
all the access to,
to all the different disciplines that we

2434
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:01,650
have today,
if we have them in the 19 fifties,

2435
01:56:01,651 --> 01:56:06,651
if there was really like that kind of an
evolutionary growth like immediately 

2436
01:56:06,651 --> 01:56:06,660
from 1900 dash,
1950,

2437
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:09,180
that'd be incredible.
That'd be so fascinating.

2438
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:14,300
If in a lifetime we go from 1900 to us 
right now or advance or even more 

2439
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,630
advanced in 50 years.

2440
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:21,200
Yeah.
Like if the singularity happens in the 

2441
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:21,200
fifties.

2442
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:23,520
Exactly.
Do you believe in the multiverse stuff?

2443
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:27,510
I'm stupid.
I'm too stupid to argue about it.

2444
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:28,790
I read,
um,

2445
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:33,950
some new thing about,
I forget what it was that made them 

2446
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:35,800
believe that some sort of a,
some sort of sound,

2447
01:56:35,801 --> 01:56:37,350
something vibration.
What was the,

2448
01:56:37,351 --> 01:56:42,351
the latest.
There's some latest evidence of a 

2449
01:56:42,351 --> 01:56:42,351
multiverse.
What do you know,

2450
01:56:42,351 --> 01:56:43,650
what it is now on the Internet?

2451
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:46,230
It's all still.
What if though I.

2452
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:47,840
that's the only bad thing about the 
whole thing.

2453
01:56:47,841 --> 01:56:50,810
We're never going to probably find out 
in our lifetime.

2454
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:53,010
I don't know,
man.

2455
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:58,240
If you look back,
if you want to see how much we've 

2456
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,341
advanced,
just go back like we were talking about 

2457
01:57:00,341 --> 01:57:00,950
earlier and check out the medical idea.
People have this scientific ideas.

2458
01:57:00,951 --> 01:57:02,360
People at here it is right here.

2459
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:05,040
First observational test of the 
multiverse.

2460
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:10,270
The theory that our universe is 
contained inside a bubble and that 

2461
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:13,491
bubble,
that multiple alternate universes exist 

2462
01:57:13,491 --> 01:57:18,111
inside their own bubbles making up the 
multiverse is for the first time being 

2463
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,480
tested by physicists to research papers 
published in physical review letters and

2464
01:57:25,291 --> 01:57:30,291
physical review.
D are the first detail how to search for

2465
01:57:30,451 --> 01:57:35,451
signatures of other universes.
Physicists are now searching for 

2466
01:57:35,451 --> 01:57:36,210
disliked patterns in the cosmic 
microwave.

2467
01:57:36,211 --> 01:57:38,280
Background,
relic,

2468
01:57:38,281 --> 01:57:40,560
heat radiation leftover from the Big 
Bang,

2469
01:57:40,561 --> 01:57:45,561
which could provide telltale evidence of
collisions between other universes in 

2470
01:57:45,561 --> 01:57:48,210
our own whoa.
Collisions,

2471
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:53,930
evidence of collisions of universes.
What the fuck dude collisions.

2472
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,190
That's the alternative concept to the 
Big Bang as well.

2473
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:04,370
The idea that our universe,
whether it's in a bubble like the 

2474
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:05,160
multiverse or the people that proposed 
membranes,

2475
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:10,161
they proposed that the brains collide at
certain points and that creates like a 

2476
01:58:10,161 --> 01:58:12,030
recycling of the of the world.

2477
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:17,120
We just can't wrap our head around 
something that's that far or that long,

2478
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:19,250
that much longer,
uh,

2479
01:58:19,251 --> 01:58:24,251
a period of existence than our own life.
The idea of this cycle that's billions 

2480
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:30,050
and billions of years.
We are so important in our own lives 

2481
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:32,670
that the idea that that's how small 
apart we play for real.

2482
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,880
I'm going to exist for 80 years inside 
some weird biological body and some 

2483
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:41,700
crazy process that happens every 16,
$17,

2484
01:58:41,701 --> 01:58:44,560
billion years.
These things collide with each other and

2485
01:58:44,561 --> 01:58:48,430
everything starts completely from new.
No planets,

2486
01:58:48,431 --> 01:58:49,450
man,
no nothing.

2487
01:58:49,451 --> 01:58:54,451
Just particles and gas and heat and 
nuclear explosions and fucking mass 

2488
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:56,950
connects all these different objects 
together.

2489
01:58:56,951 --> 01:59:00,910
And they slowly formed planets and then 
live grows on them,

2490
01:59:00,911 --> 01:59:03,790
and then life becomes complex.
Life becomes intelligent,

2491
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:06,280
self-aware,
life creates technology,

2492
01:59:06,281 --> 01:59:09,310
goes to war,
blows up the fucking universe,

2493
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:12,400
and then they collide again and more 
collide all around.

2494
01:59:12,401 --> 01:59:16,360
And it's a constant cycle of you 
society,

2495
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:17,680
life.
Everything in the universe,

2496
01:59:17,681 --> 01:59:21,280
complexity gets to a certain peak and 
then just they just hit each other.

2497
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:25,720
Maybe it's not that much time in between
each collision.

2498
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:31,020
Maybe it's not.
Maybe a genius thought are really great 

2499
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:31,510
idea when people have like super great 
ideas,

2500
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:35,080
maybe that's a collision,
a collision that's happened,

2501
01:59:35,081 --> 01:59:37,030
maybe like maybe,
uh,

2502
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:42,330
maybe,
maybe it happens on the micro scale and 

2503
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:45,271
not just on the macro scale.
It's like perhaps there's like super 

2504
01:59:45,271 --> 01:59:46,990
tiny universe is that bubble again and 
again,

2505
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:51,991
stars and like manifest in the form of 
somebody who came up with the theory of 

2506
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:57,181
relativity or some kind of Gullah 
culture shaping idea like communism or 

2507
01:59:58,421 --> 02:00:03,421
something like that.
Maybe that every great idea is just a 

2508
02:00:03,421 --> 02:00:07,050
projection of the multiverse coming 
through people and manifesting here is 

2509
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:11,761
massive global change and maybe we're 
getting hit by more of them now like a 

2510
02:00:11,761 --> 02:00:15,880
media or swarm of these multi.
These other universes bumping into ours.

2511
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:20,050
Falcon Mckenna wrote this awesome,
weird story.

2512
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:25,050
Did you ever read this thing?
He talked about how it is right around 

2513
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:28,880
when Christianity started,
the universe ripped into a multiverse 

2514
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:32,941
and there's another advanced dimension 
right next to ours that's concerned over

2515
02:00:33,551 --> 02:00:38,320
the fact that we have nuclear weapons,
but like normally we can be ignored,

2516
02:00:38,321 --> 02:00:43,321
but the fact we have nuclear weapons 
kind of like makes things in multiverse 

2517
02:00:44,071 --> 02:00:46,300
is next to us that are aware of is 
worried,

2518
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:49,360
but he wrote it not like it was really 
wrote it in this strange way.

2519
02:00:49,361 --> 02:00:52,600
Like I couldn't tell if he was trying to
write a metaphor or something.

2520
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:54,880
I just don't want to find it is fucking 
cool,

2521
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:58,240
but this tesla thing you're talking 
about.

2522
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:00,610
It's so funny because you have to think,
okay,

2523
02:01:00,611 --> 02:01:05,611
well I guess my brain just completely 
manufactured this alternate reality or 

2524
02:01:05,611 --> 02:01:07,960
super intelligent people that invented 
all these things.

2525
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:13,320
That's like one version of it or the 
other version which a lot of I think 

2526
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:16,351
shamans talk about his idea of the 
spirit world where that moment your 

2527
02:01:16,351 --> 02:01:21,061
astral body went to some alternate 
dimension and sow one possibility of the

2528
02:01:22,331 --> 02:01:27,331
way our universe could have turned out 
and then came back here and now you're 

2529
02:01:27,331 --> 02:01:27,340
broadcasting that.

2530
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:29,860
Say as many people as listening,
listen to the show.

2531
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:36,010
You're a leak of some weird,
some weird coordinate of the multiverse 

2532
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:43,350
is coming through you now as you talk 
about this thing that's like it's a 

2533
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:45,821
dream.
Maybe there's some fucking part of the 

2534
02:01:45,821 --> 02:01:47,651
multiverse where where will 69 gorillas 
stay the fuck away

2535
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:50,720
away from there.
It just.

2536
02:01:50,790 --> 02:01:54,360
To me it was almost like a little 
message that everything is preposterous.

2537
02:01:55,800 --> 02:02:00,450
Do you take.
Do you ever stop and wonder how much

2538
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:02,220
of

2539
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:07,950
your life,
how much of the things that you go 

2540
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:10,771
through are real and how much of it may 
be some sort of a background noise going

2541
02:02:12,191 --> 02:02:17,191
on in this weird play that you're 
creating for yourself to your 

2542
02:02:17,191 --> 02:02:20,731
imagination has put forth and then 
Sunday you're going to understand it 

2543
02:02:20,731 --> 02:02:23,551
all,
but right now it's all the people that 

2544
02:02:23,551 --> 02:02:25,651
are in front of you or the bit players 
and you're supposed to be trying to 

2545
02:02:25,651 --> 02:02:28,141
figure this thing out as you move along.
All that stuff that's going on in the 

2546
02:02:28,141 --> 02:02:28,141
background car accidents

2547
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:33,430
or seems like there's so many pieces 
going together to like too to too many 

2548
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:34,050
times.
I'm like,

2549
02:02:34,051 --> 02:02:36,390
that's just weird that that just 
happened like that.

2550
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:37,740
You know,
like it just seems like it's just

2551
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:39,940
manifesting things in your own mind.
Yeah,

2552
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,980
yeah,
yeah.

2553
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:42,580
It's not,
it's not a fault.

2554
02:02:42,610 --> 02:02:44,140
It's not foolproof.
You know?

2555
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,000
It's not like he could prove it.
Right,

2556
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:47,170
but there's something going on.

2557
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:49,390
Yeah,
I think it is.

2558
02:02:49,391 --> 02:02:53,560
I think there,
there there's something to the idea that

2559
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:58,600
we're like,
when you know someone's going to call 

2560
02:02:58,600 --> 02:02:58,600
you and then you pick up the phone and 
it's them.

2561
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,880
That's just weird.
There's something to that.

2562
02:03:00,881 --> 02:03:03,040
I don't know what it is.
I'm not,

2563
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:05,890
but I don't buy that.
It's just coincidence.

2564
02:03:06,490 --> 02:03:11,490
It may be coincidence sometimes,
but I've had sharp moments where I 

2565
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:13,780
thought of somebody and I looked at the 
phone.

2566
02:03:13,810 --> 02:03:17,020
It started ringing and it was like sharp
moments.

2567
02:03:17,410 --> 02:03:20,860
Like I don't know what that is.
I don't know what it is.

2568
02:03:20,980 --> 02:03:25,980
You could say that.
It's just luck in anticipation of 

2569
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:28,181
meeting each other.
You know that I was hoping that person 

2570
02:03:28,181 --> 02:03:28,181
called me,
but not even man.

2571
02:03:28,181 --> 02:03:30,280
Sometimes you don't even think about 
that person for a long time.

2572
02:03:30,281 --> 02:03:31,600
Then all sudden you think about them 
like,

2573
02:03:31,601 --> 02:03:36,601
wow,
I haven't talked to him in fucking 10 

2574
02:03:36,601 --> 02:03:39,031
years,
and then he leaves you an email and 

2575
02:03:39,031 --> 02:03:39,031
you're like,
what is that?

2576
02:03:39,031 --> 02:03:39,031
What is

2577
02:03:39,031 --> 02:03:39,730
it just happened to me?
Dude,

2578
02:03:39,731 --> 02:03:42,640
I just on the lab under our.
I just did.

2579
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:48,230
My friend Brendan Walsh came in and we 
both go to the same medicinal marijuana 

2580
02:03:48,230 --> 02:03:51,961
dispensary and we're both talking about 
how awesome it is and the people that 

2581
02:03:51,961 --> 02:03:54,580
work there really fucking cool and so 
I'm like,

2582
02:03:54,581 --> 02:03:59,581
you know what,
I'm going to do a commercial for this 

2583
02:03:59,581 --> 02:04:01,681
dispensary.
Like I want to do like a all the way 

2584
02:04:01,681 --> 02:04:01,681
commercial should be.
I'm not getting paid.

2585
02:04:01,681 --> 02:04:06,211
They don't even know who I am.
I'm just going to do this commercial 

2586
02:04:06,211 --> 02:04:06,211
because they're cool people and a cool 
fucking place.

2587
02:04:06,211 --> 02:04:07,030
So I,
I did like little,

2588
02:04:07,031 --> 02:04:10,840
like there's a character on a Webinar or
a teacup pig is basically little Hobo.

2589
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:15,610
I,
I did this stupid commercial for them.

2590
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
The next day I went in there to get my 
medicine and I walked in and the guy's 

2591
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,280
like,
Hey,

2592
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:23,050
I look at this,
look at this,

2593
02:04:23,530 --> 02:04:27,370
and he just pulled up on the computer,
the lavender,

2594
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:29,590
our episode where I did the 
advertisement.

2595
02:04:29,591 --> 02:04:34,090
Now what the fuck are the odds that the 
odds of that are pretty God damn slim.

2596
02:04:34,091 --> 02:04:34,720
I mean,
it's.

2597
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:38,460
I think the odds that that guy would 
even hear it are pretty slim.

2598
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:42,060
But if you consider the idea of me 
coming there at the exact time,

2599
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:43,890
you just pull it up on the computer.

2600
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:46,110
Dude,
I don't think you have any idea how many

2601
02:04:46,111 --> 02:04:51,111
people listened to you on this podcast.
I bet probably was a big pothead podcast

2602
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:58,161
fan and he probably listens to this one 
or listens to yours and he knew exactly 

2603
02:04:58,681 --> 02:05:03,681
who the fuck you were and he,
he seen you online because he thought 

2604
02:05:03,681 --> 02:05:04,320
you were hilarious.
When I find out that about a comedian of

2605
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:08,420
someone that I think is funny or a 
musician or some new music like I got,

2606
02:05:08,421 --> 02:05:10,270
I just got into Queens,
queens of the Stone Age,

2607
02:05:10,271 --> 02:05:15,271
every slab and looking up on them and 
reading different articles about them 

2608
02:05:15,271 --> 02:05:17,070
and downloaded a couple of their cds.
It's great stuff.

2609
02:05:17,071 --> 02:05:22,071
But when you then you all of a sudden 
you know what that person looks like if 

2610
02:05:22,071 --> 02:05:22,320
you recognize them.
So if this guy was like a lavender,

2611
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:22,490
our

2612
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,650
fan wasn't.
His friend had told him about it.

2613
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:28,490
I'm just saying that weird temporal 
coincidence of me.

2614
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:31,700
I even tried to pee on your parade.
The parade.

2615
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:35,210
I want it to be the voice of logic of 
all.

2616
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:40,270
I mean this was,
but I more people listen to your show 

2617
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:42,560
and the lavender are for one too.

2618
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:43,780
You got to get rid of that broad.

2619
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,020
Get outta here.
Holy Shit.

2620
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:51,990
I was like,
man,

2621
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:53,380
don't go down

2622
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:54,780
please.
Man.

2623
02:05:54,781 --> 02:05:59,781
People love those kinds of shows.
Jay Moore does it with his girl and 

2624
02:05:59,781 --> 02:06:04,370
everybody.
There was an article on our website 

2625
02:06:04,370 --> 02:06:04,370
about,
um,

2626
02:06:04,370 --> 02:06:04,370
uh,
uh,

2627
02:06:04,370 --> 02:06:07,020
what's his face?
Who the fuck does it with his girl,

2628
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:08,610
uh,
Gilbert,

2629
02:06:08,610 --> 02:06:09,660
Gilbert,
Gilbert,

2630
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:14,660
Jesus Christ,
Bill Burr and his girlfriend would get 

2631
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:14,660
into arguments and he doesn't want his 
Monday morning podcast.

2632
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:17,610
There was a whole thread about how they 
love it when bill burrs girlfriend comes

2633
02:06:17,611 --> 02:06:18,630
on because it's fun.

2634
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:19,510
It's a,
it's A.

2635
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:22,130
I think that's some of the funniest 
moments when we start arguing.

2636
02:06:22,131 --> 02:06:22,580
Kevin Smith,

2637
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:24,910
his wife.
That was an interesting one.

2638
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:25,570
It's,
it's,

2639
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:27,580
you know,
it's a different dynamic man.

2640
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:29,890
You know,
husband and wives have weird dynamics.

2641
02:06:29,950 --> 02:06:31,540
Men and women.
We're dynamics,

2642
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:32,240
you know,
uh,

2643
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:34,210
doing yours.
I love doing your podcast.

2644
02:06:34,211 --> 02:06:39,211
It was fun.
It was fun seeing you in this different 

2645
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:39,211
environment,
you know,

2646
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:41,170
because whenever you and I do a podcast,
we do it over here,

2647
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:43,690
but doing it over there,
it was cool to see,

2648
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:48,750
you know,
you and her have this real cute little 

2649
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:51,520
banter thing going back and forth and 
we're all sitting in this thing together

2650
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:53,800
and you have to stop every 20 minutes 
because it's a,

2651
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:56,680
it's about to crash your hard drive.
Like it's like so totally dunk.

2652
02:06:56,681 --> 02:06:57,340
It's like,
oh,

2653
02:06:57,341 --> 02:06:58,210
this is awesome.
It's awesome.

2654
02:06:58,300 --> 02:06:59,650
Hold on guys.
I got to say this,

2655
02:06:59,651 --> 02:07:01,240
I got to say this.
This is gold.

2656
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:02,700
Hold up.
So every 20 minutes

2657
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,770
saving it on his fucking hear that sound
effect.

2658
02:07:05,771 --> 02:07:07,630
We fixed it,
we fixed it.

2659
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:08,800
You know what I like.

2660
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:12,390
This is what I really liked about it.
She and you are very different,

2661
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:17,420
but she lets you be you.
She's not trying to change you and 

2662
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:18,450
you're such an odd guy.
Dunkin and I've,

2663
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:20,280
you know,
we've had,

2664
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:25,520
you know,
you've had situations in the past where 

2665
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:27,771
girls did kind of get that,
that was good and they wanted to turn 

2666
02:07:27,771 --> 02:07:31,881
you into something else.
Like do you remember the time when you 

2667
02:07:31,881 --> 02:07:31,881
were thinking about quitting comedy and 
you're going to go back to school?

2668
02:07:31,881 --> 02:07:33,030
Yeah,
because every time I get on the show,

2669
02:07:33,031 --> 02:07:35,310
you'll remind me and everyone about it.
It was.

2670
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,550
It was a brilliant moment.
Yeah,

2671
02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:39,370
it was a beautiful moment.
It was.

2672
02:07:39,371 --> 02:07:41,230
It was a moment,
which I don't mind by the way.

2673
02:07:41,231 --> 02:07:42,070
I was joking.
I don't know.

2674
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:42,700
I know.
I know,

2675
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:45,000
but who were you dating?
Sigourney weaver.

2676
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:49,360
Those moments when you realize that 
someone is morphing you and then you are

2677
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:54,361
trying to conform to what they like 
because you don't want them to leave 

2678
02:07:54,361 --> 02:07:57,571
you.
Those are creepy fucking weird moments 

2679
02:07:57,571 --> 02:07:58,810
that that's terrible or scary moments.

2680
02:07:59,190 --> 02:08:01,410
Those are scary fucking moments because.
Because.

2681
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:03,230
Well they are all.
You know what they are.

2682
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:06,340
It's an illusion of being scary because 
you know,

2683
02:08:06,341 --> 02:08:06,880
I mean,
well,

2684
02:08:06,881 --> 02:08:07,390
no,
it isn't.

2685
02:08:07,391 --> 02:08:12,391
I mean for some people,
what happens if you put a baby inside 

2686
02:08:12,391 --> 02:08:12,391
one of those people?
What happens if like,

2687
02:08:12,391 --> 02:08:12,391
yes,
that's.

2688
02:08:12,391 --> 02:08:17,110
Then then you're connected forever.
You're chained to a person who's this 

2689
02:08:17,110 --> 02:08:20,390
satisfied with you as a human,
but here's the thing.

2690
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:24,560
They're being with someone for awhile,
you're,

2691
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:29,630
you're going to watch people go through 
phases and they're going to be some 

2692
02:08:29,630 --> 02:08:31,990
phases that people are in it maybe 
you're not so cool with,

2693
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:35,530
you know what I mean?
And you have to differentiate between is

2694
02:08:35,531 --> 02:08:40,531
this person or am I dissatisfied with 
some core aspect of this human or are 

2695
02:08:41,171 --> 02:08:43,490
they just in a weird spot right now?
And I got to see,

2696
02:08:43,491 --> 02:08:44,500
you know what I mean?
It's,

2697
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:45,690
it's tricky because

2698
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:49,720
you and your chick or unusual in that 
you're both in the same line of business

2699
02:08:49,721 --> 02:08:52,630
and you work together and you still get 
along.

2700
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,240
Yeah.
How the fuck does that happen?

2701
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:56,870
Um,

2702
02:08:57,210 --> 02:09:00,180
doesn't always happen.
It doesn't always happen.

2703
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:01,980
We don't always get along.
We're not in a,

2704
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:05,700
we have a great relationship.
But if you think that.

2705
02:09:05,701 --> 02:09:06,060
I mean,

2706
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:10,760
relationships aren't idyllic,
you know what I mean?

2707
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:13,700
But what is it like,
like you're mean and you open for her,

2708
02:09:13,701 --> 02:09:14,630
right?
Yes.

2709
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:18,180
Well that's kind of your feature for 
multiple sale,

2710
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:19,980
right?
I'll open for whatever.

2711
02:09:19,981 --> 02:09:22,230
I do open a lot of shit.
Open car doors for open.

2712
02:09:22,231 --> 02:09:25,500
Everything is open fucking cans.
What I'm trying to say,

2713
02:09:25,501 --> 02:09:30,501
she's a good comic too.
She's a great comic and she's fucking 

2714
02:09:30,501 --> 02:09:33,681
disciplined and really funny.
And when we work together we are synergy

2715
02:09:35,041 --> 02:09:37,070
creates a lot of funny shit and,
and I'm,

2716
02:09:37,071 --> 02:09:40,860
and I make her laugh and she's got one 
of the greatest lines I've ever heard.

2717
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:46,070
And so that keeps me wanting to be funny
around her and instead of it like her 

2718
02:09:46,171 --> 02:09:49,950
rejecting me being funny.
She embraces it.

2719
02:09:49,951 --> 02:09:51,960
And so then you've got girls reject you 
being funny.

2720
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:52,980
Uh,
I would,

2721
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:55,260
I wouldn't say like reject me being 
funny,

2722
02:09:55,261 --> 02:09:58,950
but I think it's more of a,
it's more with her.

2723
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:01,320
Is it a conformity thing?
Like they wanted you to like,

2724
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:04,440
I know it's always crazy power,
man.

2725
02:10:04,770 --> 02:10:09,770
It's not a conformity thing.
It's like you're either in a 

2726
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:12,021
relationship with somebody where you can
create a symbiosis and merge your power 

2727
02:10:12,021 --> 02:10:15,861
together and you both want each other to
be successful or you're in a situation 

2728
02:10:15,861 --> 02:10:16,170
with someone where somebody wants to be 
on top.

2729
02:10:16,171 --> 02:10:21,171
Somebody wants to be at.
Someone wants to be literally on top in 

2730
02:10:21,171 --> 02:10:24,240
every single way.
And so if you're in a relationship where

2731
02:10:24,241 --> 02:10:27,540
somebody is trying to repress your 
creativity out of fear,

2732
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:30,390
then as a human being,
you have to,

2733
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:32,220
you have to get out of that 
relationship.

2734
02:10:32,221 --> 02:10:34,100
But it's not that easy.
You're in love with somebody.

2735
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:39,100
What do you.
What do you mean by what you were just 

2736
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:39,380
saying?
Someone that always wants to be on top,

2737
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:40,430
on top,

2738
02:10:41,330 --> 02:10:42,530
on top of the game,
on,

2739
02:10:42,990 --> 02:10:45,110
on top of you in every way.
Dominant.

2740
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,790
The dominant one.
The if,

2741
02:10:46,810 --> 02:10:49,490
if you're with someone who you've had 
that man.

2742
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:52,220
Oh yeah,
I would say you did want to hear

2743
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:57,490
that one's full on someone just 
constantly fucking with you.

2744
02:10:58,610 --> 02:10:59,120
Constantly.

2745
02:10:59,190 --> 02:11:00,540
Time for that.
Really,

2746
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:06,460
I think.
I think the important thing to realize 

2747
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,230
that she has a vagina is not a life of 
hell,

2748
02:11:08,231 --> 02:11:13,231
but it's true.
They're fucking shades of this that 

2749
02:11:13,231 --> 02:11:13,231
we're talking about.
There's shades of this and,

2750
02:11:13,231 --> 02:11:15,880
and I,
and the reason it's kind of a common,

2751
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:21,240
you know,
it's a common thing when you see in a 

2752
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,420
sitcom or a movie.
The theme of that got yes,

2753
02:11:22,421 --> 02:11:24,820
dear.
Whatever she wants is what goes.

2754
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
It's because we're talking about a some 
form of interaction that happens between

2755
02:11:31,090 --> 02:11:32,890
the masculine and feminine

2756
02:11:32,940 --> 02:11:33,810
energies.
Will,

2757
02:11:33,811 --> 02:11:35,010
you don't,
it's really interesting.

2758
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,000
Um,
you,

2759
02:11:36,001 --> 02:11:37,950
you've grown more.
It's true.

2760
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:40,740
You've grown more as a person.
I mean,

2761
02:11:40,741 --> 02:11:45,741
you,
you've always been a guy who's really 

2762
02:11:45,741 --> 02:11:47,670
pretty introspective and kind of 
brutally honest about yourself,

2763
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:52,730
pro or con.
But when you're in a steady 

2764
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:52,920
relationship,
I always feel like,

2765
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:55,050
especially like right now,
like you're in a healthy one,

2766
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:56,940
you,
you're in a,

2767
02:11:57,110 --> 02:11:59,280
you're in a way different place 
creatively.

2768
02:11:59,430 --> 02:12:03,420
Like you're able to express yourself 
without the burden of.

2769
02:12:03,450 --> 02:12:08,450
There's a lot of psychological fucking 
warfare that goes on and constantly bad 

2770
02:12:08,611 --> 02:12:10,830
relationships that really clouds up the 
mind.

2771
02:12:11,070 --> 02:12:12,720
And when you're in a healthy 
relationship,

2772
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:14,280
you know,
like you are,

2773
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:17,070
it allows you to think about things much
clearer.

2774
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:22,310
Your ability to describe reality just 
over the past few years,

2775
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:25,080
you've gotten so much better at it.
Man,

2776
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:27,150
you're,
you're writing's gotten better.

2777
02:12:27,151 --> 02:12:30,690
Your comedies gotten better.
You've always been a super smart dude,

2778
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:35,400
but I think that when,
when you're in a position where you,

2779
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:40,580
you find someone who doesn't try to 
fucking change who you are is so 

2780
02:12:40,711 --> 02:12:43,440
important.
So worst thing in the world,

2781
02:12:43,441 --> 02:12:48,441
is he one of your friends stuck in some 
situation where someone's trying to get 

2782
02:12:48,441 --> 02:12:51,771
him to be something that he's not right,
not encourage them to do what he wants 

2783
02:12:51,771 --> 02:12:51,771
to do,
but to get them to.

2784
02:12:51,771 --> 02:12:53,370
You're never going to make it as a 
comedian.

2785
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:54,180
Just give this up.

2786
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:56,980
Yeah.
The thing about you can write books.

2787
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:58,440
Yeah.
I get encouraged like that.

2788
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:03,460
Yeah.
It's a very cool relationship because 

2789
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:03,520
the income I get encouraged to go on 
stage more.

2790
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:06,150
You got to go on stage more.
You gotta go up all the time.

2791
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:07,970
You gotta work harder.
Why you get onstage?

2792
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:09,670
Do you had to do standup?
Go on the road,

2793
02:13:09,671 --> 02:13:14,671
get a headlining sets,
like a really good situation for sure.

2794
02:13:15,491 --> 02:13:16,550
Yeah,
but you know,

2795
02:13:16,551 --> 02:13:16,750
if

2796
02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:18,520
she was married to some square dude 
who's like,

2797
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:23,550
you know,
fucking accountant or something like 

2798
02:13:23,550 --> 02:13:23,550
that.
It's like,

2799
02:13:23,550 --> 02:13:26,941
you know her interests and needs and 
weirdness and probably be too much for 

2800
02:13:26,941 --> 02:13:27,250
him.
You know what I mean?

2801
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:29,800
It's like you guys meet at the perfect 
time,

2802
02:13:29,801 --> 02:13:32,220
your weirdness in your,
your creativity.

2803
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:35,070
She understands it.
She gets it.

2804
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:40,130
She gets what you're doing.
She gets that this is a gonna result in 

2805
02:13:40,130 --> 02:13:44,001
you killing on stage.
Whereas someone who doesn't see you as 

2806
02:13:44,001 --> 02:13:47,781
being successful enough things that they
can fix you and mold you and turn you 

2807
02:13:47,781 --> 02:13:49,350
into something respectable.
They can bring it parties.

2808
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:50,880
Oh,
this is my boyfriend Duncan.

2809
02:13:50,881 --> 02:13:53,790
He's a professor at Cornell.
What do you teach?

2810
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:54,510
Uh,
you know,

2811
02:13:54,511 --> 02:13:56,940
mostly ancient history,
but a philosophy.

2812
02:13:57,450 --> 02:13:59,460
Can I get you another tree,
you know,

2813
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,520
and you got those suede patches on your 
elbows and you're just thinking about 

2814
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:08,991
telling a great suck my cock joke and 
killing in front of a large crowd at the

2815
02:14:09,271 --> 02:14:11,970
comedy store on a Friday night,
a nice 10:00

2816
02:14:11,971 --> 02:14:16,971
spot.
You're crushing you thinking about that 

2817
02:14:16,971 --> 02:14:16,971
while you're hanging out with some 
dildos,

2818
02:14:16,971 --> 02:14:21,420
some stupid house where they eat French 
cheese had come in their pants.

2819
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:23,850
Wow.
The second part.

2820
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:27,780
And then you watch two monkeys,
fuck,

2821
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:33,050
I knew a dude from France and him and 
his wife became friends with them and 

2822
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:36,861
they had me over for some weird dish 
that they have with non pasteurized 

2823
02:14:36,961 --> 02:14:39,570
cheeses and he was like really adamant 
about that,

2824
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:44,780
that when they homogenized and 
pasteurized cheese in America fucks up 

2825
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:45,900
the flavor.
So he has to sneak this shit over.

2826
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:46,940
Illegal cheese.
Yeah.

2827
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:49,200
He actually sneaks it over.
Wow.

2828
02:14:49,250 --> 02:14:49,590
Yeah,
yeah,

2829
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,060
yeah.
He puts it in some,

2830
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:54,420
a container that says it's pasteurizer 
modular as they have people that will do

2831
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:57,060
it for them because it's stinks.
It was kind of was bacteria in it,

2832
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:59,860
you know,
but it's so good.

2833
02:14:59,861 --> 02:15:01,110
And that's what.
I'm sorry.

2834
02:15:01,111 --> 02:15:03,780
But that's what blue cheese is.
You look at those crumbles.

2835
02:15:03,781 --> 02:15:05,070
The blue cheese,
the blue part.

2836
02:15:05,071 --> 02:15:05,660
That's like fun.

2837
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:07,510
Can Mold.
Why would it be illegal though?

2838
02:15:07,511 --> 02:15:09,610
Just because it's considered like a 
poison or something?

2839
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:10,780
Good question.
Um,

2840
02:15:10,781 --> 02:15:14,170
I think it's a really good question.
I think just for public health concerns,

2841
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:15,370
when you,
uh,

2842
02:15:15,490 --> 02:15:17,770
when you like raw milk,
it's like real dangerous.

2843
02:15:17,771 --> 02:15:19,390
You can only keep it for a certain 
amount of time.

2844
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:20,470
Now,
how long is it good.

2845
02:15:20,471 --> 02:15:22,270
For me,
regular milk is good for like a month.

2846
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:27,600
Raw milk can be good for more than like 
seven or nine days or something like 

2847
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:27,600
that.
I would imagine.

2848
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,320
And you know,
people can get sick,

2849
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:30,790
you know?
I think that's,

2850
02:15:30,980 --> 02:15:35,980
that's some of the theory behind it is 
that it when you homogenize things 

2851
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:37,600
pasteurized and you can pick them,
keep them on the shelf longer,

2852
02:15:37,870 --> 02:15:41,080
but that's also how you apparently 
cooked the enzymes.

2853
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:44,230
That's one of the reasons why people 
have lactose intolerance,

2854
02:15:44,410 --> 02:15:47,980
but some people with lactose intolerance
can actually drink raw milk and not have

2855
02:15:47,981 --> 02:15:49,990
any problems with it.
Weird.

2856
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:52,060
Yeah.
But raw milk tastes delicious dude.

2857
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:54,670
Raw whole milk.
It's like really?

2858
02:15:54,730 --> 02:15:57,070
It tastes really good.
Like with cookies.

2859
02:15:57,130 --> 02:16:02,130
Oh it's the shit.
It's so like rich and creamy and you 

2860
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:06,271
know,
it seems so alive when you drink it as 

2861
02:16:06,271 --> 02:16:06,430
opposed to like,
you know when you drink regular,

2862
02:16:06,431 --> 02:16:07,870
homogenized,
pasteurized milk.

2863
02:16:07,871 --> 02:16:09,220
This is milk,
body,

2864
02:16:09,790 --> 02:16:11,770
dead milk,
water,

2865
02:16:12,550 --> 02:16:16,810
Whitewater thing.
It's not so weird but comes from a cow.

2866
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:19,180
This cheese that I got in Paris,
God,

2867
02:16:19,181 --> 02:16:20,740
you sound like a jerk when you talk like
this.

2868
02:16:20,741 --> 02:16:22,490
You sound like such a jerk.
But this cheese I had,

2869
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:25,000
it was like talk.
It was not,

2870
02:16:25,030 --> 02:16:28,090
it was not just like a little bit of 
mold.

2871
02:16:28,091 --> 02:16:29,710
Like you'll get cheesy and you'll see 
the green stuff.

2872
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:32,980
It was like flourishing more like when 
you leave,

2873
02:16:32,981 --> 02:16:37,981
like just rising above the cheese,
just like blowing with mold and it was 

2874
02:16:38,111 --> 02:16:43,111
so good.
You just ate the whole diarrhea or weird

2875
02:16:44,261 --> 02:16:47,860
feelings.
I don't even want to talk about.

2876
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:52,880
Really.
I don't even want to talk about what I 

2877
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:52,880
did do at June.
Why would you even eat that?

2878
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:56,740
You made so you had all this delicious 
food and you got mad diarrhea and you're

2879
02:16:56,741 --> 02:16:58,690
trying to get us to eat it.
It wasn't diarrhea.

2880
02:16:58,691 --> 02:17:03,580
It was something worse for it.
Did you do your girl get it to.

2881
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:04,780
No,
I don't think so.

2882
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:06,430
Did she eat the same stuff you ate?
Yeah.

2883
02:17:06,431 --> 02:17:08,110
If she got it,
she didn't tell me.

2884
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:09,310
Well good.
That's good.

2885
02:17:09,450 --> 02:17:12,640
That's nice.
You can wear that like this is.

2886
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,210
I don't want to tell us.
She's a good girl.

2887
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:19,320
I had it.
It was very intense what it did to my 

2888
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:19,320
stomach.
Dude,

2889
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:19,320
there's nothing wrong with a good shit 
story.

2890
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:24,000
I always in this jazz club in Paris and 
I have,

2891
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,820
first of all,
if you say that to the right girl you're

2892
02:17:28,821 --> 02:17:31,350
in.
Not when I followed up with this.

2893
02:17:31,370 --> 02:17:32,650
Okay.
I,

2894
02:17:34,190 --> 02:17:38,520
I like what I did to the bathroom 
because like when I got up,

2895
02:17:38,521 --> 02:17:40,500
after I'd finished,
I'm trying to make this as not.

2896
02:17:40,501 --> 02:17:44,670
When I was done with my shit and I 
looked back at the toilet,

2897
02:17:45,210 --> 02:17:48,510
it was like a shit bazooka.
Come Adam.

2898
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:52,680
It was like everything was just 
everything.

2899
02:17:52,930 --> 02:17:55,240
Like I like,
it was crazy where I,

2900
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:57,080
I panicked.
I was like,

2901
02:17:57,081 --> 02:17:57,980
Oh God,
I gotta get Outta here.

2902
02:17:58,010 --> 02:18:03,010
Get outta here.
Someone walks in here now I might get 

2903
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:03,010
arrested so much shit.

2904
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:10,200
They would arrest you for oversharing.
Look him in the clinic.

2905
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:12,710
Yeah.
Girls share poop.

2906
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:15,450
A pictures with each other.
It's just like guys don't really.

2907
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:17,360
They take pictures of their poo,
I would imagine.

2908
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:18,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

2909
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:20,330
This is a world.
Women should be allowed.

2910
02:18:20,331 --> 02:18:23,030
The freedom of shock.
Shocking people with a giant poops.

2911
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:26,470
I love him.
I wish I could put them online.

2912
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:30,310
I wish I could put my pictures online.
You can fuck Outta here.

2913
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:33,610
Nothing stopping you.
Just intelligence.

2914
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:39,230
Hey,
you're going to be in a New Orleans to 

2915
02:18:39,230 --> 02:18:39,230
see your shit man.
I don't want to get upset when.

2916
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:40,770
When I,
when I see people's Shit.

2917
02:18:40,771 --> 02:18:41,640
I don't know.
I'm going to see it.

2918
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:42,660
Yeah,
I'm going to be in New Orleans.

2919
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:47,690
Yeah.
You got to check out this restaurant in 

2920
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:47,690
New Orleans.
It's,

2921
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:48,330
it's crazy.
It's called oceans.

2922
02:18:48,410 --> 02:18:49,860
Uh,
when I tell you right now,

2923
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:51,690
I just started thinking about those 
catacombs.

2924
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:53,460
Ocean,
ocean,

2925
02:18:54,230 --> 02:18:55,440
ocean,
restaurant,

2926
02:18:55,441 --> 02:18:56,080
ocean.
It.

2927
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,470
I just saw the show on the woman CEO 
owns it.

2928
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:00,730
Tried to trick me.
Is it really,

2929
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:06,000
you know,
they were on that show I was talking 

2930
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,890
about once a kitchen nightmares and you 
got to watch a season for it.

2931
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:12,510
Last episode of season four,
but the guy on there is and almost tried

2932
02:19:12,511 --> 02:19:13,480
to beat up,
uh,

2933
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:15,410
the chef and then the,
the,

2934
02:19:15,440 --> 02:19:20,440
the kitchen man or the head chef had 
like some seizure thing going on with 

2935
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:21,360
his face and they fired him on the show 
anyways.

2936
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:24,480
They're completely crazy.
And so sometimes when people are on that

2937
02:19:24,481 --> 02:19:29,481
show,
I'll go on yelp to see if like their 

2938
02:19:29,481 --> 02:19:29,481
business is,
you know,

2939
02:19:29,481 --> 02:19:30,280
like in business and stuff like that or 
see what the reviews now or,

2940
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:33,350
and on their yelp right now it's like 
110.

2941
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:36,560
We came with 110 people were trying to 
negotiate the bill,

2942
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:41,180
like manager went psycho called cops on 
and start throwing things screaming.

2943
02:19:41,830 --> 02:19:44,810
And so you watch this episode and then 
you look at the yelp.

2944
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:47,870
This might be the craziest fucking place
ever to go to.

2945
02:19:48,050 --> 02:19:48,990
Wow.
You got it.

2946
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:51,500
And then you look at their website and 
it's like a friendly website,

2947
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:55,010
like the happiest thing in the world.
It's crazy.

2948
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:57,530
Have you ever been there before?
New Orleans?

2949
02:19:58,090 --> 02:20:00,250
Yes.
A long time ago I was there,

2950
02:20:00,251 --> 02:20:01,540
uh,
for a UFC.

2951
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:07,150
It was,
who knows God when nobody knew what the 

2952
02:20:07,150 --> 02:20:08,290
UFC was back then.
It was during the news radio days.

2953
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:10,690
Yeah.
I don't remember much,

2954
02:20:10,750 --> 02:20:15,750
man.
We'll put on some fights and left when 

2955
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:15,750
we were eight of the restaurant and 
people were saying,

2956
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:15,750
be careful.
It's dangerous.

2957
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:16,580
That's what I kept hearing,
Blah.

2958
02:20:16,690 --> 02:20:17,530
Be careful.
It's dangerous.

2959
02:20:18,050 --> 02:20:20,320
People kept saying,
be careful.

2960
02:20:20,321 --> 02:20:21,520
It's dangerous.
People get robbed.

2961
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:25,750
There's apparently a extraordinary 
amount of crime around New Orleans.

2962
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:28,760
My Dad would take me to New Orleans.
He'd go to a bar,

2963
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:34,150
he gave me like 60 bucks.
I get fucking drunk and wander down the 

2964
02:20:34,150 --> 02:20:36,410
street and just take nitrous oxide 
heads.

2965
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:38,870
Hold on a second.
How old are you?

2966
02:20:38,990 --> 02:20:42,440
I think I was like 16,
15.

2967
02:20:42,441 --> 02:20:44,590
I don't know what.
That's what I used to do.

2968
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:45,800
16 to.
Yeah.

2969
02:20:45,860 --> 02:20:50,860
I would go down the street and get.
Because you could buy nitrous oxide 

2970
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:51,100
balloons.
So I,

2971
02:20:51,130 --> 02:20:52,580
I,
I,

2972
02:20:52,581 --> 02:20:57,581
this is how bad kid I was.
I spent all my money on a stripper and 

2973
02:20:58,731 --> 02:21:01,640
all these nitrous oxide balloons and 
some booze.

2974
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:07,270
So I know it money that was supposed to 
last for a couple of days that my dad 

2975
02:21:07,270 --> 02:21:09,420
had given me and then I told my dad I 
got mugged him.

2976
02:21:09,610 --> 02:21:12,440
More money to spend on more nitrogen 
oxide.

2977
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:16,530
Is that crazy easy with corporation,
half of their profit is just from people

2978
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:19,580
doing balloons.
It's not crazy.

2979
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:21,310
Come on.
Half the profit that.

2980
02:21:21,311 --> 02:21:24,510
I mean that has to be.
I used to bike,

2981
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:27,620
but you were reading something online.
I'm sure man.

2982
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:31,230
I bet it's not even one percent.
No Way.

2983
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:31,910
No,
no.

2984
02:21:31,911 --> 02:21:34,280
Sixteen year olds.
Sixteen year olds do it.

2985
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:39,920
Out of 100.
How many people do you know that make 

2986
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:39,920
their own whipped cream?
Yeah,

2987
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:40,730
exactly.

2988
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:48,410
Awesome.
Here's some homemade whipped cream.

2989
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:50,660
Everyone enjoy.
I made this myself

2990
02:21:51,730 --> 02:21:54,110
couple of times and it is delicious.
I don't.

2991
02:21:54,111 --> 02:21:57,020
I think most people by the web stuff,
don't get me wrong,

2992
02:21:57,110 --> 02:21:59,520
but I've made it a couple times.
It's pretty bad.

2993
02:21:59,521 --> 02:21:59,600
Okay.

2994
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:04,850
Start.
You got to get one of those blenders 

2995
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:06,431
things was to whisks.
They spend with each other and you get 

2996
02:22:06,431 --> 02:22:06,690
it a bowl and you add all the 
ingredients.

2997
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:08,280
I've done it a couple times.
It's pretty dope.

2998
02:22:08,610 --> 02:22:11,070
Real whipped cream tastes better because
you know,

2999
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:14,000
just.
But you know,

3000
02:22:14,130 --> 02:22:15,390
come on man,
I ain't making this shit.

3001
02:22:15,970 --> 02:22:16,860
I don't have the time for that.

3002
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:21,750
But the stuff that's in the cans that 
doesn't taste as good,

3003
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:23,650
that doesn't care.
She's good as trump.

3004
02:22:23,870 --> 02:22:26,250
Like if you go to a real restaurant and 
get some real whipped cream

3005
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,030
with strawberries.

3006
02:22:27,830 --> 02:22:30,600
When I see a can of whipped cream to 
this day,

3007
02:22:31,230 --> 02:22:36,230
all I think about is how it comes to my 
mind when I see a can of whipped cream,

3008
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:40,530
when I will use to my.
I had a friend in high school introduced

3009
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:45,560
me to whippets and after that I don't 
know if my parents thought I was trying 

3010
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:49,470
to become a pastry chef.
What the fuck they thought in Ohio,

3011
02:22:49,471 --> 02:22:54,471
they sold it everywhere today.
So at video stores whip it's like you 

3012
02:22:54,471 --> 02:22:58,401
come in and go buy a cracker,
a balloon and the easy web at a video 

3013
02:22:58,401 --> 02:22:58,800
store.
That's how popular was in Columbus.

3014
02:22:59,350 --> 02:23:01,780
So what is it?
What is it?

3015
02:23:01,850 --> 02:23:02,920
There's no whip cream in it.
Done.

3016
02:23:02,921 --> 02:23:03,490
It's just the air.

3017
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:03,930
No,
no,

3018
02:23:03,931 --> 02:23:08,931
it's just the air that you use,
the screw on the machines that would 

3019
02:23:08,931 --> 02:23:08,931
pump the air out,
like to go,

3020
02:23:08,931 --> 02:23:10,950
you learn how to do it,
you don't shake it up,

3021
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:14,490
you buy it and you don't shake it out 
cause the gas rises to the top.

3022
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:17,400
So you just do it right off the top when
you first do it.

3023
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:22,970
I'm talking about these low content 
canisters that you put in like a thing 

3024
02:23:22,970 --> 02:23:24,540
and they put it balloons talking about 
cracking the whip cream.

3025
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:25,830
I never did that.
That's,

3026
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:28,440
that's,
that seems more like wasting your task.

3027
02:23:28,441 --> 02:23:31,230
So you're talking about just some 
nitrous oxide and sell.

3028
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:33,300
They sell easy whips.
Where is that?

3029
02:23:33,301 --> 02:23:34,500
What it's called?
Nitrous oxide?

3030
02:23:34,550 --> 02:23:36,720
No,
two nitrogen,

3031
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:39,390
I think nitric oxide.
But uh,

3032
02:23:39,391 --> 02:23:41,160
but yeah,
and they come in these little containers

3033
02:23:41,161 --> 02:23:46,161
and they come you and by the case in 
each balloon then you have that metal 

3034
02:23:46,161 --> 02:23:49,731
cracker that looks kind of like 
something like a camping gear thing 

3035
02:23:49,731 --> 02:23:50,610
where you unscrew it and you put it in,
close it,

3036
02:23:50,611 --> 02:23:55,611
you put the balloon on one side and you 
crack it and it just fills a hole 

3037
02:23:55,611 --> 02:23:55,611
balloon.
And then just take the blind.

3038
02:23:55,611 --> 02:23:55,611
Yeah.

3039
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:57,900
When I was a kid,
I worked at a,

3040
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:58,910
one of those,
um,

3041
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,930
ice cream place.
It's called newports creamery.

3042
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:03,540
Newport Krumrie.
They serve like cheeseburgers and shit.

3043
02:24:03,541 --> 02:24:06,990
I was a cook for a little while and I 
got fucking horrible zits from that.

3044
02:24:06,991 --> 02:24:07,920
That's the nastiest,
cyber,

3045
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:10,500
but also a scooped ice cream and made 
ice cream Sundaes.

3046
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:12,380
And we would have to go replenish the,
uh,

3047
02:24:12,381 --> 02:24:14,610
the containers because it would make 
their own whipped cream.

3048
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:19,720
Yeah.
So they had these giant fucking 

3049
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:19,720
containers of nitrogen and everyone was 
a burnout.

3050
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:21,330
They would all go back there and get it.
That's great.

3051
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,710
I only did it once.
I didn't like it.

3052
02:24:23,010 --> 02:24:25,290
That was my,
I was scared of drugs days.

3053
02:24:25,650 --> 02:24:27,750
That was all my martial arts.

3054
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:29,330
You know what that sound is,
don't you?

3055
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,650
Helicopter.
Is that what happens when you do the,

3056
02:24:32,651 --> 02:24:36,280
uh,
the nitric triple starts going in waves.

3057
02:24:36,590 --> 02:24:39,240
You hear the incident sounds like,
whoa,

3058
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:39,890
whoa,
Whoa,

3059
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:44,900
whoa.
Any truth to the fact that shit 

3060
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:45,180
instantly makes you retarded in my.
Yeah.

3061
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:52,390
It seems like it would fuck you up 
hardcore,

3062
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:54,730
but it's not as bad as as as dis 
cleaner.

3063
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:59,740
Like.
Like I also add when I couldn't find a 

3064
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:01,771
nitrogen,
I would get disciplined for keyboards 

3065
02:25:01,771 --> 02:25:01,771
and stuff like that.
That shit was way worse.

3066
02:25:01,771 --> 02:25:02,620
I remember doing that and going,
wow,

3067
02:25:02,650 --> 02:25:05,350
this is horrible.
Talking about anal nitrate.

3068
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:05,870
No,
no,

3069
02:25:05,890 --> 02:25:07,180
no.
He's talking about the spray,

3070
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:10,720
the spray that you spray on keyboards,
but I don't think they have any more.

3071
02:25:10,721 --> 02:25:12,640
I think an air now this shit.
Yeah,

3072
02:25:12,641 --> 02:25:14,590
I see that.
Oh No,

3073
02:25:14,591 --> 02:25:18,190
not get high for us.
Don't do that.

3074
02:25:18,310 --> 02:25:19,000
Don't do it.
Please.

3075
02:25:19,001 --> 02:25:21,370
I'll just kill.
I think that's just canned air.

3076
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:24,010
Yeah.
I don't

3077
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:25,510
think they'd make it anymore.
Maybe not.

3078
02:25:25,570 --> 02:25:27,700
I don't know.
Century duster.

3079
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:29,910
Maybe.
I kind of feel a little lightheaded.

3080
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:32,520
So what would that do?
Duty.

3081
02:25:32,521 --> 02:25:35,500
You did almost the same thing as 
nitrous,

3082
02:25:35,501 --> 02:25:37,930
but it was grocer,
like after you're done,

3083
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:38,170
you're like.

3084
02:25:39,290 --> 02:25:44,290
It seems like it's what you're 
experiencing is just oxygen being cut 

3085
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:44,290
out of your bloodstream and your body 
almost

3086
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:49,210
sky.
Thinking about how many different ways 

3087
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:49,210
people have sought to achieve altered 
states of consciousness,

3088
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:53,120
huffing paint themselves and jerking off
while they were at lingerie.

3089
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:54,140
Yeah.
How about that?

3090
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:58,760
I was watching the wonderful whites of 
West Virginia again on the plane and uh,

3091
02:25:59,030 --> 02:26:04,030
one of the things that they were talking
about was Jessica and how much gasoline 

3092
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:04,030
he sniffed that he huffed so much 
gasoline.

3093
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:06,200
He could tell the difference between 
regular and high test.

3094
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:14,200
He doesn't have to look at the time.
And he was talking about how you have 

3095
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:14,200
gasoline.
10.

3096
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:17,250
My strange addiction.
No,

3097
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:22,360
what does that show on Tlc?
And one of the episodes is a woman is 

3098
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:24,170
addicted to sniffing gasoline.
I wake up in the morning,

3099
02:26:24,380 --> 02:26:26,450
sniffed out.
She's like super hooked on it.

3100
02:26:26,451 --> 02:26:30,680
So at her house is just filled with like
old bottles of gas and she's,

3101
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:34,530
she spends all her money on gas.
Oh my gosh.

3102
02:26:34,610 --> 02:26:37,790
You just addicted to huffing gas.
She loves it.

3103
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:40,430
What the fuck is that?
Is that psychological?

3104
02:26:40,431 --> 02:26:41,170
It must be right?

3105
02:26:41,300 --> 02:26:42,320
Yeah.
Because she's like,

3106
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:44,240
I get addicted.
Yeah,

3107
02:26:44,241 --> 02:26:45,300
you can.
I mean Shit.

3108
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:48,080
Watch that episode.
She's addicted or she craves it.

3109
02:26:48,081 --> 02:26:52,280
Kinda like that disease where you crave 
and gas for 15 years.

3110
02:26:52,281 --> 02:26:52,850
You're crazy.

3111
02:26:52,850 --> 02:26:57,850
Yeah,
but what I'm saying is it become become 

3112
02:26:57,850 --> 02:26:57,850
physically addictive,
like they think that amy winehouse,

3113
02:26:57,850 --> 02:27:00,920
one of the speculations and amy 
winehouse died because she tried to quit

3114
02:27:01,010 --> 02:27:04,400
alcohol cold Turkey,
which can happen to people,

3115
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:07,670
but they know that happens.
Council found medication in a room.

3116
02:27:07,671 --> 02:27:09,650
Who knows,
but you're right.

3117
02:27:09,710 --> 02:27:14,710
It's very possible,
but my point is that it is possible for 

3118
02:27:14,710 --> 02:27:17,201
that to happen.
They know that that's a documentable 

3119
02:27:17,201 --> 02:27:17,201
occurrence.
When people just quit,

3120
02:27:17,201 --> 02:27:21,650
they need to wean yourself off the 
alcohol to stressing your system to just

3121
02:27:21,651 --> 02:27:22,670
quit.
You can kill you.

3122
02:27:22,730 --> 02:27:23,930
That's amazing.
Delirium,

3123
02:27:23,931 --> 02:27:27,120
tremens,
you're losing eight and you die and it's

3124
02:27:27,121 --> 02:27:32,121
probably.
It's probably several drugs and shit 

3125
02:27:32,121 --> 02:27:32,121
like that.
Very addictive drugs that are like.

3126
02:27:32,121 --> 02:27:35,010
There's antidepressants that if you get 
off of yield,

3127
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:38,830
you'll get vertigo.
Do have you seen the fucking commercials

3128
02:27:38,831 --> 02:27:42,250
for that Game Deuce?
Do something x than Walmart,

3129
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:45,400
like people cyborgs and it's a new video
game.

3130
02:27:45,401 --> 02:27:46,540
What the fuck,
man,

3131
02:27:46,541 --> 02:27:48,240
I watched that.
It's an insane.

3132
02:27:48,370 --> 02:27:51,570
Those x x think that's how you say it,
but yeah,

3133
02:27:51,571 --> 02:27:54,880
that's a really old game man.
And this is uh,

3134
02:27:54,900 --> 02:27:59,900
the newest version of this really old 
concept that was like a really wicked 

3135
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:04,611
game if I remember.
It was made by the same guys that made 

3136
02:28:04,611 --> 02:28:08,210
Dika Catana.
There was like this faction of ids 

3137
02:28:08,210 --> 02:28:09,480
software that broke off and there was 
this character,

3138
02:28:09,481 --> 02:28:11,870
I think his name is Romero.
And He,

3139
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:15,240
he started this company and they made 
two games.

3140
02:28:15,241 --> 02:28:20,241
One of them had all this hype behind.
It was called dikw autonomy and I 

3141
02:28:20,241 --> 02:28:20,241
thought it was pretty bad ass.
It was great.

3142
02:28:20,241 --> 02:28:22,340
Like death match style.
He was like a quake.

3143
02:28:22,341 --> 02:28:27,341
One Guy,
he was with quake from the very 

3144
02:28:27,341 --> 02:28:29,321
beginning,
but this other game they made this dose 

3145
02:28:29,321 --> 02:28:31,751
xx.
I'm pretty sure it's the same company 

3146
02:28:31,751 --> 02:28:31,751
and this game was apparently awakened

3147
02:28:31,751 --> 02:28:35,510
dude fucking commercial.
Have you seen the commercial with the 

3148
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:35,880
cyborgs begging?
Because they are,

3149
02:28:35,890 --> 02:28:37,540
they're on this drug that you have to be
honoring.

3150
02:28:37,570 --> 02:28:42,570
Your body rejects the cybernetic part.
So it's all these people with like 

3151
02:28:42,570 --> 02:28:46,371
Cyborg arms are like hookers with Cyborg
legs begging because they have to pay 

3152
02:28:46,371 --> 02:28:49,050
for this medicine that you have to take 
to keep the,

3153
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:54,590
keep your excel falive and it's got its.
I don't know what the game plays like 

3154
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:57,300
is.
This seems like just pure Cgi,

3155
02:28:57,301 --> 02:28:59,340
like movie making.
So I don't know what the game plan.

3156
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:02,510
Is this a,
is it an xbox game or a PC game?

3157
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:07,540
I don't know what game a dose X.
Do you have these Weird d,

3158
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:12,350
u e u x or d?
It's gotten checks in it.

3159
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:17,800
Yeah.
If you look up like I was a computer 

3160
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:20,561
game,
but I think they also ported it over to 

3161
02:29:20,561 --> 02:29:20,561
something.
It was a couple of years ago.

3162
02:29:20,561 --> 02:29:20,800
Yeah,
it was a long one.

3163
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:23,900
It's coming out this month.
The first one came out a long time ago.

3164
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:29,080
I'm,
I might be confused with linking it up 

3165
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:29,080
with the people from China.
Sorry,

3166
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:30,920
Uber nerds and Geeks.
If I've steered you wrong.

3167
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:32,660
Do you remember dying autonomy?
No.

3168
02:29:32,890 --> 02:29:34,640
It's pretty dope.
It was fun.

3169
02:29:34,641 --> 02:29:39,641
It was.
It disappointing to a lot of people 

3170
02:29:39,641 --> 02:29:39,980
because they thought that it was kind of
a derivative,

3171
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:41,570
you know,
a bunch of the games that existed,

3172
02:29:41,571 --> 02:29:42,980
but to me it was pretty fucking fun.

3173
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:44,780
Especially the death match was really 
fun.

3174
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:49,960
I don't need any other game.
Then starcraft you don't like like fast 

3175
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:52,520
twitch games like quake,
starcraft's who's fast twitch,

3176
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:55,630
got all defensive,
knows how you get.

3177
02:29:56,300 --> 02:29:58,130
Did you notice two V,
two Gold Lake?

3178
02:29:58,170 --> 02:29:59,480
They got a little defensive,
right?

3179
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:04,600
He did that game like starcraft,
who's fast twitch minute,

3180
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:08,390
constant argument with everyone over 
starcraft.

3181
02:30:08,391 --> 02:30:12,320
Two total dork was well for one playing 
video.

3182
02:30:12,321 --> 02:30:14,120
Playing starcraft.
Two is like they think I'm in.

3183
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:16,370
How much are you playing starcraft?
Two.

3184
02:30:16,610 --> 02:30:17,960
How often that?
As much as a Korean,

3185
02:30:17,961 --> 02:30:19,690
but not as much as the Chinaman.
Three,

3186
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:23,450
three,
three,

3187
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:25,320
three games a day.
Three days.

3188
02:30:25,321 --> 02:30:26,900
A lot of people right now saying that 
that's racist,

3189
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:28,490
but he's meanwhile ladies,
gentlemen,

3190
02:30:28,491 --> 02:30:31,190
listen to the context of using him.
He's saying it's awesome.

3191
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:32,810
Yeah.
Saying it's awesome.

3192
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:34,340
Yeah,
but let's be honest.

3193
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:35,960
Asians love that game.
They do.

3194
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:36,860
They do,
right?

3195
02:30:36,861 --> 02:30:37,880
Koreans love that game,
right?

3196
02:30:38,230 --> 02:30:39,170
Don't they have,
like they,

3197
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:43,490
we've talked about the other things,
it's the first time

3198
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:46,700
I feel like I've been able to watch 
something akin to sports,

3199
02:30:47,450 --> 02:30:52,450
really get excited about it because they
just had this big tournament and they 

3200
02:30:52,450 --> 02:30:55,811
have like famous players and it was 
really cool to watch these two famous 

3201
02:30:55,811 --> 02:30:55,811
players,
uh,

3202
02:30:55,811 --> 02:30:57,290
compete against each other and knowing 
the game,

3203
02:30:57,320 --> 02:31:00,800
having played it,
seeing the crazy tricks they're using in

3204
02:31:00,801 --> 02:31:04,970
the crazy control they have over so many
variables.

3205
02:31:05,150 --> 02:31:10,150
It's amazing to watch.
And then it's so funny because I was 

3206
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:10,670
thinking like athletes of the future are
all going to be fat,

3207
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:15,700
fat and Pale because like they cut to 
these guys who just played this insane 

3208
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:18,950
game that's like required so much brain 
power to control this.

3209
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:23,340
And since all they do is play computers,
they're kind of emotionless.

3210
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:28,580
Like you cut to like a UFC fighter after
each is knock someone out and it's like 

3211
02:31:28,801 --> 02:31:32,310
watching Julius Caesar March into a city
that each is defeated.

3212
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:33,870
It's fucking,
you're watching glory.

3213
02:31:34,050 --> 02:31:38,760
When you got cut to a starcraft two 
fighter player who's just won a game,

3214
02:31:38,761 --> 02:31:43,110
it just kind of like one of them took 
his shirt off because underneath that he

3215
02:31:43,111 --> 02:31:45,770
was wearing a shirt that was kind of 
insulting and he's like,

3216
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:50,820
eh.
Then walked over and shook the guy's 

3217
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:50,820
hand,
Oh,

3218
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:50,820
good job.
And that's it.

3219
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:54,400
But meanwhile they just did this crazy 
thing where they were controlled.

3220
02:31:54,401 --> 02:31:56,830
I've never played the game of watched 
the best,

3221
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:03,320
uh,
don't understand what's happening so I 

3222
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:03,320
can appreciate it is the greatest game.
It's like,

3223
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:05,010
it's like,
it's like Sim city in space.

3224
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:10,430
It looks pretty crazy.
It looks like you got to do a lot of 

3225
02:32:10,430 --> 02:32:13,551
different things and you're moving 
around a lot of different shit and 

3226
02:32:13,551 --> 02:32:13,551
you're setting things up all over the 
place.

3227
02:32:13,551 --> 02:32:18,380
You're building the ideas,
you're building up this economy by 

3228
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:20,010
gathering resources and while you're 
building this economy,

3229
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:25,250
you're also constructing an army that 
has to be based on what your opponent's 

3230
02:32:25,250 --> 02:32:25,290
doing.

3231
02:32:25,290 --> 02:32:28,410
So you can't just do the same thing over
and over again.

3232
02:32:28,411 --> 02:32:33,411
You have to like scout what your 
opponent's doing and from seeing what 

3233
02:32:33,411 --> 02:32:37,041
they're doing.
You understand what their strategy 

3234
02:32:37,041 --> 02:32:37,041
probably is and then you have to like 
create a perfect,

3235
02:32:38,030 --> 02:32:43,030
a perfect offense to what they're doing 
while building a defense that works 

3236
02:32:43,030 --> 02:32:47,451
against the type of troops they're 
constructing because it might not 

3237
02:32:47,451 --> 02:32:50,271
always.
You have to be completely reactive and 

3238
02:32:50,271 --> 02:32:51,420
you have to be able to do all of this.
Well.

3239
02:32:51,421 --> 02:32:54,270
It's like juggling.
You're juggling all these crazy balls at

3240
02:32:54,271 --> 02:32:59,271
once and you have to be able to do this 
and also instantaneously react to shit 

3241
02:32:59,271 --> 02:33:03,921
that you don't expect to happen.
Isn't it crazy that the most satisfying 

3242
02:33:03,921 --> 02:33:06,540
game is a virtual representative of war?
Yeah,

3243
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:08,760
totally.
Pretty much all our.

3244
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:10,230
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing?

3245
02:33:10,231 --> 02:33:15,231
Well,
that battlefield earth call of duty 

3246
02:33:15,231 --> 02:33:15,231
quake,
Mario Brothers,

3247
02:33:15,231 --> 02:33:16,230
unreal tournament.

3248
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:21,670
The Mario or some sort of a futuristic 
or you know,

3249
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:27,380
ancient or either like world war two or 
something like the words fucking 

3250
02:33:27,541 --> 02:33:29,040
futuristic something.
Yeah.

3251
02:33:29,041 --> 02:33:34,041
What the fuck.
You read that book war by Sebastian 

3252
02:33:34,041 --> 02:33:35,610
younger where there isn't a square.
He does is he describes what that's like

3253
02:33:35,611 --> 02:33:40,611
to be behind a fucking machine gun 
blasting people like he does this 

3254
02:33:40,611 --> 02:33:43,731
incredible description of it and the 
adrenaline that that creates is like 

3255
02:33:43,731 --> 02:33:48,560
amazing,
but I'll tell you something else that 

3256
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:51,111
creates adrenaline.
When I do attend pool rush into my 

3257
02:33:51,111 --> 02:33:55,071
opponent's face and my fucking speed 
links in circle is base and devour it.

3258
02:33:55,790 --> 02:34:00,790
Only she and then he has the audacity to
text me and say that I was doing cheese 

3259
02:34:01,561 --> 02:34:04,170
moves.
That's the greatest feeling ever.

3260
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:07,800
I see it and believe it and I think that
if I got into it,

3261
02:34:07,801 --> 02:34:12,801
I'd fucking love it too much and you 
would go there.

3262
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,570
Now I got a deleted it.
I'm deleting it tomorrow.

3263
02:34:15,571 --> 02:34:17,710
I think pool for me is a form of

3264
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,140
like a moving meditation.
When I'm running out,

3265
02:34:20,141 --> 02:34:21,100
when I played pool,
it's.

3266
02:34:21,101 --> 02:34:24,520
I'm using my body as well and that's one
of the things that I like about the most

3267
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:29,700
that I'm forcing my mind to control the 
exact amount of forest my body exerts on

3268
02:34:30,521 --> 02:34:35,080
a piece of wood that impacts a ball that
collides and into another ball and moves

3269
02:34:35,081 --> 02:34:36,430
around.
In order to do it right,

3270
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:41,640
I have to be in total tune with the 
amount of revolutions and causing this 

3271
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:45,991
ball to turn over a nine foot table.
I mean that's what I'm trying to 

3272
02:34:45,991 --> 02:34:49,381
control.
So to get like into that like real 

3273
02:34:49,381 --> 02:34:52,390
groove of being like dead stroke where 
you really feel the movement.

3274
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:57,600
It really is like a form of meditation.
So that's why I prefer it over video 

3275
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,630
games.
I had to pick my poison,

3276
02:34:58,810 --> 02:35:03,810
I had to pick like what thing am I 
allowing myself to be addicted to and 

3277
02:35:03,810 --> 02:35:06,400
that I think I get more out of the pool 
than I did out of the video games.

3278
02:35:06,401 --> 02:35:11,401
The Video Games was fun as fuck man,
I love him to this day but I can't play 

3279
02:35:11,401 --> 02:35:11,401
you.

3280
02:35:11,401 --> 02:35:14,920
We played any of the connect games like 
there's a game right now called child of

3281
02:35:14,921 --> 02:35:17,620
Eden.
Have you fucking smoke some good weed or

3282
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:19,690
take some shrooms and stand in front of 
that game?

3283
02:35:19,691 --> 02:35:21,850
You will fucking feel like you're doing 
virtual.

3284
02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:24,740
If I'm alone at home,
I'll fire up gears a war for a goof.

3285
02:35:24,741 --> 02:35:27,490
Just go on a fucking rampage because 
it's fun because it's just.

3286
02:35:27,491 --> 02:35:30,710
The graphics are so dope,
so wild.

3287
02:35:30,711 --> 02:35:32,570
Seeing these fucking monsters they've 
created.

3288
02:35:32,571 --> 02:35:34,130
I'll do that for fun on the big screen,

3289
02:35:34,130 --> 02:35:35,930
but yeah man,
you got to moderate it.

3290
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:40,990
That's a province so fucking addictive 
and it's so easy to lose your mind to 

3291
02:35:40,990 --> 02:35:41,380
get lost in it

3292
02:35:41,570 --> 02:35:46,570
really just lost,
but yet it's so fucking fun.

3293
02:35:47,850 --> 02:35:51,150
And what?
Who's to say that that fund is less real

3294
02:35:51,210 --> 02:35:54,620
than the fun that you get actually out 
there playing basketball then?

3295
02:35:54,621 --> 02:35:55,830
Oh,
I'll say it.

3296
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:57,300
Yeah,
me too.

3297
02:35:57,301 --> 02:35:59,220
I think it's less real,
but why?

3298
02:35:59,221 --> 02:36:01,970
What if you're in tune and dominating 
you?

3299
02:36:02,130 --> 02:36:02,940
Why?
Why?

3300
02:36:03,030 --> 02:36:08,030
Because when I get done with an 
addictive session of world of warcraft 

3301
02:36:08,030 --> 02:36:08,850
and I've been playing,
or I'm sorry,

3302
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:12,260
I used to be addicted to that.
You started to starcraft two.

3303
02:36:12,660 --> 02:36:17,660
When I get up after playing that game 
for like three or four hours straight 

3304
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:22,880
and walk outside,
I feel like I feel like I'm like a 

3305
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:26,320
mentally disabled.
I feel drained.

3306
02:36:26,340 --> 02:36:28,890
My sleep sucks when I fucking,
you know,

3307
02:36:28,970 --> 02:36:33,970
uh,
go to the gym or go jogging or do 

3308
02:36:33,970 --> 02:36:33,970
something like that.
I feel great for the rest of the day.

3309
02:36:33,970 --> 02:36:38,010
So video games are amazing and weirdly 
games that involve strategy,

3310
02:36:38,011 --> 02:36:43,011
I think you can extrapolate some 
information from that that you can use 

3311
02:36:43,011 --> 02:36:46,071
in real life,
but you got to do it in very small 

3312
02:36:46,071 --> 02:36:46,071
doses.
It's like that.

3313
02:36:46,071 --> 02:36:47,580
That seems like the responsibility of 
human beings.

3314
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:52,790
We've got this incredible brand new 
technology that's exploding in front of 

3315
02:36:52,790 --> 02:36:54,360
us.
The discipline is not to reject it.

3316
02:36:54,361 --> 02:36:56,580
Totally like those assholes.
When you hear,

3317
02:36:56,610 --> 02:37:00,030
I don't even have cell phone,
it's not to reject it.

3318
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:02,460
The idea is that moderate at learn how 
to use it,

3319
02:37:02,461 --> 02:37:03,780
like a tool.
How do you do it?

3320
02:37:03,781 --> 02:37:04,220
That's what every.

3321
02:37:04,310 --> 02:37:05,750
It's like when I said I was addicted to 
it,

3322
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:08,150
city of heroes,
I used to always fantasize about jumping

3323
02:37:08,151 --> 02:37:13,151
on from building the building just 
because I had been playing that video 

3324
02:37:13,151 --> 02:37:13,250
game so much and that was something I 
was doing repetitively

3325
02:37:13,710 --> 02:37:15,590
all day,
all night.

3326
02:37:15,740 --> 02:37:16,070
If you

3327
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:19,370
dropped me off in the middle of a castle
and they look like the scenes from quake

3328
02:37:19,371 --> 02:37:24,371
one,
I might start pretending I started 

3329
02:37:25,490 --> 02:37:30,490
talking like one of those quick cuts 
running down hallways with rocket 

3330
02:37:30,741 --> 02:37:34,130
launchers.
Talking as usual.

3331
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:35,480
Yes,
you're the best.

3332
02:37:36,550 --> 02:37:39,020
You're the best man.
You are those too much fun.

3333
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:44,380
Too Much to interesting and I'm going to
enjoy all the taped phone conversations 

3334
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:48,430
that the FBI will be tuning into myself.
Ideas here,

3335
02:37:48,470 --> 02:37:51,310
ready to get bored.
FBI conversations.

3336
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:55,010
My phone conversations suck.
Have Fun with that.

3337
02:37:55,700 --> 02:37:59,060
Thank you to the fleshlight for 
sponsoring the podcast.

3338
02:37:59,061 --> 02:38:04,061
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the 

3339
02:38:04,061 --> 02:38:04,061
flashlight,
enter the code name Rogan,

3340
02:38:04,061 --> 02:38:06,260
and you will get 15 percent off the 
number one sex toy for men.

3341
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:08,570
Thank you everybody who came out to the 
show in Milwaukee.

3342
02:38:08,571 --> 02:38:10,520
Thanks to everybody who's saying happy 
birthday.

3343
02:38:10,521 --> 02:38:15,521
To me,
that was one of the coolest things that 

3344
02:38:15,521 --> 02:38:15,521
I've ever had happened in my life.
It was pretty fun.

3345
02:38:15,521 --> 02:38:16,850
Uh,
Milwaukee was the shit.

3346
02:38:16,851 --> 02:38:18,370
I had a great time.
Next,

3347
02:38:18,371 --> 02:38:21,200
a big road gig is Denver,
Colorado.

3348
02:38:21,410 --> 02:38:26,410
September 23rd at the paramount theater.
And that's me and Joey motherfucking dee

3349
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:28,340
is not,
it's not a new orleans.

3350
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:32,690
Is New Orleans in between that September
23rd one is New Orleans.

3351
02:38:32,770 --> 02:38:34,850
Uh,
it is what I'll tell you right now.

3352
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:36,410
Do,
do,

3353
02:38:36,450 --> 02:38:41,450
do,
do the 16th of September a nine.

3354
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:44,740
16 to September.

3355
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:47,390
Okay.
So there nine slash 16.

3356
02:38:47,420 --> 02:38:49,430
Two thousand 11.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3357
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:52,070
I'll be at the house of Blues and New 
Orleans and this,

3358
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:54,740
some of the get there early because some
people are gonna have to stand up.

3359
02:38:54,741 --> 02:38:57,630
Unfortunately there was no other way I 
could get a show there.

3360
02:38:57,660 --> 02:39:00,670
There's another place you not get the 
standup states you will hate.

3361
02:39:00,671 --> 02:39:02,140
It sucks.
It sucks standing out.

3362
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:03,880
But I'll try to be as energetic as 
possible.

3363
02:39:03,881 --> 02:39:08,881
And I instituted a policy when Brian and
I went to see doug stanhope when we 

3364
02:39:08,881 --> 02:39:10,310
enjoyed the fuck out of Stan hope as 
always,

3365
02:39:10,311 --> 02:39:12,680
but it wasn't fun to stand and watch a 
show.

3366
02:39:12,890 --> 02:39:13,730
So I decided,
you know,

3367
02:39:13,731 --> 02:39:16,460
what I'm being brewed,
asking people stand and watch my shows.

3368
02:39:16,461 --> 02:39:18,620
Like from now on,
I'm going to make sure that every show I

3369
02:39:18,621 --> 02:39:20,180
do,
people are seated,

3370
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:22,640
but there was no places in town,
there was nothing I could do.

3371
02:39:22,641 --> 02:39:26,360
There was like small places that were 
like 50 seats or um,

3372
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:27,470
you know,
the House of Blues.

3373
02:39:27,471 --> 02:39:32,471
So we're going to do the house of Blues 
and it's a rare seating and standing 

3374
02:39:32,471 --> 02:39:32,660
show.
And that's September blonde,

3375
02:39:32,690 --> 02:39:35,060
blue eyed girl Joe Rogan dot map for 
details.

3376
02:39:35,490 --> 02:39:36,800
All right.
Can you provide some windows show?

3377
