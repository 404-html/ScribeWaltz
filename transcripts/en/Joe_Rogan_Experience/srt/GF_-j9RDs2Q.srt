1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,940
Well, we're doing it. Yeah.
Jesus, I'm not prepared.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Can experience is brought to you by
the fleshlight my favorite masturbation

3
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,390
toward the only one that I've
ever used ever in my life.

4
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:22,770
And if they hadn't sent me one, I probably
wouldn't have used it. But they did.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,850
And it is awesome, is way better
than beating off and let's be real.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,110
Everybody beats off. So do yourself
a favor and just give into reality.

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,780
Don't touch that thing. Everybody's
touched that. It's disgusting.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,200
Everybody's knowledge
it do yourself a favor.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,100
Go out and get yourself this
amazing beaten off and instrument.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,400
It's really a fantastic piece of
engineering and design designed by a guy

11
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:47,760
actually whose wife was pregnant
and he couldn't have sex, you know,

12
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:51,040
cause it was like six months in the
pregnancy and it gets a little sketchy.

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,730
You know, like what the fuck
am I doing here? You know,

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,050
I'll creep mind that I'm sticking,
you know, especially if you're,

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,900
if you're like just spending putting
your mouth, you know, she's pregnant.

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,630
She had the babies inside of,
are you just trying to get your load off?

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,440
You better off.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,740
You feel like you're supposed to be
beaten off shore from personal experience?

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,090
Like what's the cutoff point?

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,290
Misses Rogan well liked it all the
way up until the end, but oh wow.

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,540
To me I was like,
this is the deal.

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,900
You tell me when it's go time cause I
don't want to be the one that's trying to

23
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:20,730
fuck you while you're walking around
with a fucking 10 pound baby inside you.

24
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:25,320
It's just crazy. It's weird. Yes
they do. They get really horny.

25
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:29,490
They get really horny. It's supposed to
actually be good to actually helps uh,

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,990
the baby come out or something like that.

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,930
It helps dilate you or some crazy cause
he get like hotter to you as it moves

28
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:38,100
along. And they were like,
are you like, oh yeah, eight
months. This is very strange.

29
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,270
It is. I mean you can only imagine
it, you know, you don't know.

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,790
It becomes almost alien cause it's,
you know. Yeah. Because you know,

31
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,170
you're still horny.
You know,

32
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,740
everyone gets horny and she's
still an attractive woman. But the,

33
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:53,670
the issue is there's a baby in
the mix here and it's on her.

34
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:58,170
So it's a very different experience when
it's just a woman and her body and your

35
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,540
body. It's just sex. It's just fun.

36
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,870
It's just two people enjoying each
other's bodies and Lars did passion,

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,770
but when you got a baby inside a person,
but that's a totally different mix.

38
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,880
Totally different mix and knowing that
like eight months along that like it's

39
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,140
you doing that. That's a bay time
before. No, but it's a your swimmers,

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,520
so you know. Yeah. It's like
your own product is in there.
Yeah. It's very strange.

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,440
And it's also your, you are now acutely
aware of what the experience really is.

42
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:29,460
The experience of actually having a kid
actually the experience of making new

43
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,340
human beings. It is. You know, you,

44
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:36,840
you have been tricked into some ancient
mechanism that's designed to make

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,270
animals create more animals and you are,

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,200
most of your life moves in the
flows of these needs and wants,

47
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:47,040
whether or not you realize it or you don't
realize it. Once that baby comes out,

48
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,710
you are forced into a recognition.
It's a,

49
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,660
it's a real humbling experience
because you realize, wow,

50
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:56,010
this whole thing is way bigger than me.
You know, and you, you also realize, well,

51
00:02:56,011 --> 00:03:00,130
hey, now there's this person that I
love more than me. There's a little

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,851
tiny person.

53
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:04,450
I'm responsible for everything that
has to do with their life and their

54
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,830
education, their, their experience of the
guide them and protect them. It just so,

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,010
so while this is all happening, you're
trying to shoot a load into a check,

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,730
you know,
it's like you don't feel the same way

57
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,853
when you put it down.

58
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,640
Strange.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,320
So this gentleman invented something that
he could relieve his manhood with that

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,620
he didn't feel like waking up the wife
while she's about to throw up in the

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,130
morning and sticking his dick in her
butt. Tried to be nice. He's a nice guy.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,080
What about your book books? Little
pregnant. Pregnant? Sure. Yeah.

63
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,973
So anyway,

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,990
fucking Bro, I have to do that at some
point. Like I got to make a light.

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,150
You don't have to, but you know, but
the, the biological imperative is there.

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,450
Like I'm just starting to feel
I'm 35 and it starting to like,

67
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,290
it's starting to kick in and it's
terrifying and not the birthing part.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,130
That part doesn't scare me because I've
taken some huge shifts and I feel like I

69
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:59,130
could do that, but the growing
inside of me like an alien. Oh yeah.

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,520
Well your insights spread.
Yeah,

71
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,620
it's very psychedelic.

72
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,870
You know it's life becomes very
different than then it was anyway. Yeah.

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,180
If you went to in the code name
Rogan on the Joe rogan.net website,

74
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,200
is it a flashlight link?

75
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,190
You will get 15% off the number
one sex toy for a minute.

76
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:18,270
That was a commercial that was there you
guys. That's how it like commercials,

77
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,670
man.
This is the only way I can do them.

78
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,740
I listen to people do can commercials
on like other radio shows and I respect

79
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,750
what you're doing, but
God, that seems boring.

80
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:31,890
I'd rather really say something about it
every time I use it to fucking awesome

81
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:33,870
product.
Another awesome product is Alpha brain.

82
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,160
We were sponsored by [inaudible]
Dot Com and o n n I t.com.

83
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,310
And there's another thing that we've got
now called new mood and what new mood

84
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:41,521
is.

85
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:46,010
It's a five HTP supplement and a lot of
people like Neil Brennan turned me on to

86
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,020
this stuff first and five HTP actually
when you take it in allows your brain to

87
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,250
produce more serotonin.

88
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,040
It breaks down into Serotonin and
I actually makes you feel good.

89
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,350
It gives you like a nice
feeling of wellbeing.

90
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,010
And a Neil started taking it and uh,
he said he was taking like,

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,090
like three or four times where you're
supposed to take. And I was like,

92
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:10,410
is that like safe? He goes, I
don't know, but I feel great,
so fuck it. Um, but so he,

93
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,320
so I started taking it after he told
me about it and it definitely does

94
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:15,450
something,
gives you like a weird little,

95
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,040
a minor feeling of happiness is like
the best way to describe it. Very nice.

96
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,380
And this stuff,
this new mood stuff with this stuff.

97
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:24,040
What we'd done and we'd taken,
um,

98
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,520
five HTP n added l trip to
fan and l Tryptofan, uh,

99
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,100
actually breaks down. It's like one
of the building blocks for five HTP.

100
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:35,280
So He'd take the two of them together
and it gives you sort of like a time

101
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:39,300
release quality and it's just very,
they're very mellowing. I like it a lot.

102
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,870
It's a, it's really, uh, a good
calming supplement. And again,

103
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,210
like I say with all the,
uh, on it supplements,

104
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,610
if you think of are too
expensive or whatever,

105
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:51,000
you can definitely get it for cheaper,
just copied ingredients, man. Go Online,

106
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,700
find the,
find the ingredients,

107
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:57,610
they're readily available on [inaudible]
dot com go buy the stuff in bulk and

108
00:05:57,611 --> 00:06:00,230
you'll definitely save money.
And I, I'm happy if you do that.

109
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,550
I swear to God that is that like calming
in general or like calming before bed

110
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:06,710
kind of thing? Well, I take
it before bed. I take it,

111
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,940
I take two of them right before
going to sleep. But, um, uh,

112
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,930
some people take them during the day,
you know,

113
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,140
some people like to take them if they're
not getting enough sleep or extra

114
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,530
stressed out or something like that.
It's a real weird world,

115
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:22,790
the world of nootropics because it's sort
of just sort of being explored now and

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,160
just sort of coming into public
consciousness and there's a lot of

117
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,280
misconceptions about what
it does or what they do.

118
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,970
And I don't think each one
works for everybody there.

119
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:32,510
There's some that I'm not feeling them.

120
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,950
I tried them and it
doesn't do shit for me.

121
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,900
And there's other people
that swear by this stuff.

122
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,770
So you got out kind of just without me
getting into too much depth because it

123
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:41,930
would really take up
the whole of the show,

124
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,300
go look up nootropics and try a bunch
of different things. It's, it's,

125
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,170
it's fascinating, but I think
that they can enhance, uh,

126
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,050
the way your brain functions.
It makes it feel a little better.

127
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
It makes it work a little
better. And, you know,

128
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:55,940
there's a lot of arguments back and forth
about this stuff and for good reason

129
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,931
because a,
you know,

130
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,270
a lot of people when you're saying
that you can make people think better,

131
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:01,760
but that sounds a lot like big dick pills,
you know?

132
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,020
And people always say that to me.
Like,

133
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,610
how is what this is bigger than big Dick
Pills? Well, you know what man, it's,

134
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,200
it's better in that it actually
works and it might not work for you,

135
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:16,310
but it works for me and it works for
other people that I know and it's 100%.

136
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,200
It's not,
it's not like a placebo effect.

137
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,850
It gives me the most lucid dreams
that I've never had in my life.

138
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:27,590
And the big shift has been taking
this stuff. And um, as I said,

139
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:31,730
there's a bunch of different
ones available online in
a lot of different people

140
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,090
have written about them and you could kind
of create your own little concoctions.

141
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,840
It's a fun thing to get into. It's kind
of interesting. I believe in vitamins.

142
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,280
I take multivitamins, I take
minerals, I take amino acids,

143
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,390
I take fish oil.

144
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,520
I take a lot of different things
as well as like a juice every day.

145
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,230
And I drink like this Kale shake every
morning. I think I'm a big proponent.

146
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,440
Well I, you know, I try to be, you know,
I try to be as much as possible cause I'm,

147
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:01,220
I'm a big proponent of
taking care of your body.

148
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:05,390
I know when my body feels better, I know
when I'm, yeah, when you look terrible,

149
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:08,600
you look right now. Thanks
Ben. When you, when you, uh,

150
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,410
when it doesn't feel good to me.
When it's not working well,

151
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,820
nothing works well in my life.

152
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,130
I find that my life is always best in
order when I'm in shape because when I'm

153
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,320
in shape and I feel good that I
don't have to worry about that,

154
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,990
that's out of the way. So now I
don't feel like a lazy piece of Shit.

155
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
So since I don't feel
like a lazy piece of Shit,

156
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,280
all these other things seem
to fall in place much easier.

157
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,140
You said something one time to me that uh,
I thought about my bunch is um,

158
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,840
you said, I think if you better
yourself in one area of your life,

159
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,410
it has a residual effect on,
and I think that's true.

160
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,370
I thought about that a lot like that
when you are doing something to better

161
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:49,190
yourself,
it's not just like if it's working out,

162
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,840
the benefit is there's more, there's
a benefit that falls into like your,

163
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,180
they can fall into your creative stuff
or your work stuff cause you're bettering

164
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,020
yourself and it has that residual effect.
You know what I mean?

165
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,210
So cause we'll leave you work
out and you take it seriously,

166
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,900
which I've started to more,
even though I'm still lazy shit,

167
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,490
like I've started to more than you think
about things more like well I'm going

168
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:13,220
to work out like this. I
need to eat better. Yeah.

169
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,380
And then if I'm going to be
tired I need to rest more. Right.

170
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,020
And that then will better your
other aspects of life, you know,

171
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:22,710
you're going to feel more rested and it's
like you got to give yourself awesome

172
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:23,850
advice.
Yeah.

173
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,840
The real problem is getting yourself to
do what you would advise someone else to

174
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:30,150
do. That's where it becomes
difficult, right? You know,

175
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:33,720
when you try to tell
somebody, do something that
you don't do yourself, like,

176
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,950
hey man, you should work out me and
my fucking eat a cheeseburger. I mean,

177
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,070
a lot of people do that,
right?

178
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:41,070
There's a lot of people that do that
because they know someone in the back of

179
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:43,350
their head. They know the advice
that they would give themselves.

180
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,970
They're just for whatever reason,

181
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:48,750
not quite bright enough to give it or
not quite motivated or not quite clear

182
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:52,890
enough or too conflicted in whatever
way and whatever area, you know,

183
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:56,580
everybody's got their own thing,
their own confliction that allows them to,

184
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:59,830
you know, branch off into
passive distraction. But, uh,

185
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,650
I think the big key is balance. The
big key is a a balance act. You can,

186
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,490
you cannot only be work, you must
have fun, but you cannot be only fun.

187
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,040
You must have work.
There has to be things that get done.

188
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,130
There has to be information that gets
absorbed. Your brain and your body,

189
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,900
if not given a task, if not given a
purpose on this planet, starts to think,

190
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,410
what the fuck am I here for? You know?
So the only way to true happiness,

191
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,900
like ultimately it is silly.

192
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,930
Ultimately we are just one frame and an
infinite movie that goes on forever and

193
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,210
that this life might not be important,

194
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,890
but the only way to enjoy it while you're
here is to find things that you enjoy

195
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:42,210
inside of it and you, you can't totally
completely look at the big picture,

196
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:43,710
but ultimately you can't anyway.

197
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,440
Because even if you look at
the big picture with your
life and then you get past

198
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:49,020
that, you go, well, at least I
got past that. The fuck you did.

199
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,930
How about the big picture of the universe?
How about the big picture of the sun?

200
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,120
The Sun is only going to last another
few billion years and that bitch is going

201
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,260
to fizzle out and everything on this
fucking planet is either going to die and

202
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:02,190
some horrible explosion when it goes
supernova or it's going to freeze to death

203
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:05,190
first. Look, it's ridiculous.
It's all temporary.

204
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:09,120
Every fucking thing that's ever been done.
So you can get crazy like that.

205
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,300
But what I found is we're stuck here and
the only way to enjoy here is to find

206
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:20,070
stuff you like doing. Do that and have
a good time. Have a good time with here.

207
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:22,830
And one of the best ways to
have a good time. He says,

208
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:24,640
take care of your fucking body. Okay, you,

209
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,720
I think you're totally right. If you ever
read Heidegger, yeah, it's a little, okay.

210
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,600
Well he said it.
The meaning of being capital B,

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,690
the big picture is located in care,
meaning what? We attribute our care,

212
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,020
what we give care to.

213
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:41,500
So you could care for a pair of
headphones and that gives your life.

214
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,290
Inherit me like, I'm sorry. Life
is not inherently meaningful.

215
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,230
Are you talking?
It's meaningful when you care about,

216
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,720
so you attribute care to somebody doing
Brian. He's looking at the screen.

217
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,760
All right, well look at it yesterday.
It's preserved. It's killing.

218
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,883
What is it doing?

219
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,600
It's kind of just making, okay, but why
are you doing that when she's talking man?

220
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,620
Huh? I know I was making
this special effect. Okay.

221
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,960
But my indirect in her
conversation and you were bro.

222
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,660
That's what just happened. It's pretty
sweet. Okay. We don't care though, man.

223
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,640
This is, a lot of people are not
going to see this on Ustream.

224
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:15,280
So let her finish what she was saying.
She said something important.

225
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,130
I love when you scold Brian. Okay,
well that was really, it was,

226
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:20,590
he just interrupted you while you
were on a roll. So fucking desperate.

227
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,670
Some childish shit. Dare you.
Some childish shit. We love you,

228
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,050
but you're a little baby anyway,

229
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,510
but you're right. And it
is about attributing care,
cause life in and of itself.

230
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:32,730
I don't think life is inherently
meaningful. I don't think that, uh,

231
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,470
there is some magical wizard
behind the curtain that,

232
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,750
that created all of us and
we're also special and awesome.

233
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:43,310
I think it is what you make of it. And
um, I wish I exercise more as the point.

234
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,790
I'm very sorry I'm stuck in my head.
You know what I mean?

235
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,800
I've been this way since I was
a little girl. When little,

236
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,270
when everyone else was running around,

237
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,410
I was laying on top of the monkey bars
and I've always been super fucking lazy

238
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:58,090
and I wish I had this,
this design,

239
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,810
like I wish I had your athleticism or
just something about me that enjoyed

240
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:05,560
sweating. Like I fly. I
just fucking hate it. And I,

241
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,210
you don't have to love it.
Everybody's different.

242
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,640
It takes every type of people
to make this world go round.

243
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:12,470
But we're going to give you some
Alpha brain before you leave.

244
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,520
Maybe wants to take that.

245
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,640
It'll get your fucking head and
gear and you'll see the light.

246
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,860
Go to Joe rogan.net.

sweet baby Jesus.

257
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,090
The dynamic duo or are here ladies
and gentlemen, the funniest couple.

258
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:04,570
I know the only couple of
comedians worth a fuck. Wow.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,570
Wow. There's a couple other ones. I guess
Brian Duncan into Tasha are still have.

260
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,230
Yeah, they haven't pulled the
trigger. Made that shit legal.

261
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,210
Tom Segura and Christina Segura
who doesn't use the last name?

262
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:20,880
It's a girl on stage.
Why do you not?

263
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,270
Why did you not together you are more
strong. Do you want the real talk? Yes.

264
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,010
Legally.
My

265
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,150
name is Segora by stage
and because documents kid,

266
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,540
but because I uh,
my parents are Hungarian immigrants.

267
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,710
They escaped from Hungary
in 1969 went to Canada.

268
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:39,320
I was born there.
I moved to La in 1980.

269
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,530
So that stupid Polak Palicki name.

270
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,690
It's like my parents fought so hard to
get me here. And every time I see a club,

271
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:52,450
put it on the marquee, it makes
me proud. And it's a stick it to,

272
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:57,380
you know, I'm a fucking dumb Polak and you
guys can suck it. Yeah. That's who I am.

273
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,820
And uh,
you know

274
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,000
that's very, very admirable. Don't you
think they would like it more though?

275
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,260
If their name didn't hold
you back your fucking name

276
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,200
cause shit. Good luck
spelling that. Yeah. Good.

277
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:15,890
Let's finish you guys for all the marbles.
The other thing is at what point,

278
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:20,300
like if you've started, would you
consider like obviously you, you know,

279
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,300
20 years in or 10 or five,

280
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:25,490
but like after you've done a
couple things and you have your,

281
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,890
your name and then you change your name,
people who, who fuck are you, you know?

282
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,920
Yeah. You could, you could fuck
yourself up cause we learn from scratch.

283
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,060
You were what you were seven years
in when I already, whatever you do,

284
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:37,940
don't hyphenate that shit.
God damn cop out.

285
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,000
I knew a dude who hyphenated and
he took the wife's name last won,

286
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,090
somebody lost, somebody
failed. We're not doing it yet.

287
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,760
He was also a self proclaimed
feminist who was a male feminist.

288
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,910
Really leave that can exist,
but I don't know.

289
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,420
I feel like the concept of feminists
any more than I liked the concept of

290
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:02,690
masculine as don't have to concept
of someone's masculine centric.

291
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,230
That's ridiculous. Who the fuck
is more masculine centric than me?

292
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,270
I mean everything I do is meet,
had shit,

293
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,040
fucking cage fighting a choke
and people smoking weed.

294
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,410
He's talking about tags. Come on,
man, but I don't want to just be,

295
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm not only concerned with
men, I'm concerned what the
whole fucking human race.

296
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,280
As soon as you start going, oh me, you
like to dance. I danced my ass off.

297
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,260
I didn't take dancing classes of that
movie. I did a dance scene. A zookeeper.

298
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,600
That's awesome.
With the lovely Leslie Bibb,

299
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,110
the the gorgeous blonde woman
from Talladega nights. Yeah.

300
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,530
She played my who say cool.
Rarely.

301
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,010
Rarely get to act and that of my
scenes are with her and Rosario,

302
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:46,400
Doris Dawson and Kevin James. I
was like, ah, that's so cool. Yeah,

303
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,170
she was really funny. She's
hauling changes. All those scenes.

304
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,690
I could tell you some shit that
this chick would say, well,

305
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,710
we're hanging around like in between
scenes were in the van on the way.

306
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,600
She's fucking hilarious.

307
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:04,090
But at a respect for her and I would not
repeat anything she said. Sure, sure.

308
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,980
Oh, that must be really funny.
She's hilarious. She's like a comic.

309
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,510
She's like a female comic. That's
great. She's hilarious and cool as fuck.

310
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:14,900
You're very balanced. You, you
like these Alpha male things.

311
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,880
But I find you to be very
balanced and you appreciate. Well,

312
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:20,510
I still need the Alpha male stuff.
You know what it all, I mean,

313
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,140
I wouldn't say Alpha male stuff, just
masculine type things. I'd slept,

314
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:25,520
but I'd like, why? Why, why?

315
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:30,050
Why am I supposed to pretend that I don't
like something? I like loud mustangs.

316
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,450
I like when you rev the engine,
it's stupid. He goes, no,

317
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,410
I have a Mustang and I'd love, it's my
favorite car. It's the dumbest car. Hap.

318
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,470
Yeah. Well, you know what's good about
it? It's loud as fuck. And it's stupid.

319
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,000
And I like listening to Leonard Skinner
did music in that fucking loud and you

320
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,360
know, yeah. You can go look at her,
you fucking loser. I don't care.

321
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:50,070
That's that is what I liked.
I liked MMA.

322
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,920
I like playing pool until fucking
six o'clock in the morning.

323
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,070
These are the things I actually enjoy.
I mean I'm not,

324
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm not going to pretend that I don't,

325
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,670
cause I did for a long time in my
life when I was growing up though,

326
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,110
I always felt like there
was something wrong with me.
You know, like first of all,

327
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:07,350
I grew up in Boston,
which is a very pussy whipped town.

328
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,320
I mean it's a very manly town,
but there's not a lot of women there.

329
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,200
And especially amongst quote
unquote intellectuals, you know,

330
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:15,600
it's mean if you did hanging
around college people,

331
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,270
the amount of colleges per capita is
really high. It's like one of the, the,

332
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,030
the highest numbers in the country.

333
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,540
Then Boston one I think ridiculous.

334
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,260
And so most people are really educated.
Most people intelligence.

335
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,480
And when you get like a lot of educated,

336
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:32,460
intelligent people and they're
trying to impress people,

337
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:37,290
they tend to go towards the super liberal.
They tend to go towards the, you know,

338
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,710
the, there's something wrong with you.
You're a barbarian, you need to evolve.

339
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,240
They tend to get,
like you would tell someone that you,

340
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,790
you do martial arts and they would
look at you like you're insecure.

341
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,270
Like there's something wrong with you
for pursuing that and this is something

342
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,170
you need to get past.

343
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,050
Like I've had those conversations with
people where they judge you for the

344
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:55,650
things he enjoyed doing. And what they're
basically trying to do is they look,

345
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,880
no one wants to fucking run hills.
No one wants to, you know, beat a,

346
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:03,300
a t a tire with a sledgehammer.
No ones wants to do rounds on the bag.

347
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,930
No one wants to take class and fucking
strangle people for hours and hours.

348
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,570
But the only way to get good at
all that stuff is to do that.

349
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,160
So if you can persuade other people to
not get good at all the things that make

350
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:17,040
you uncomfortable, then you don't
have to feel as uncomfortable.

351
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,660
So if everybody was scrawny and sick and
smoked cigarettes and drank whiskey all

352
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,710
day, you wouldn't have to worry
about getting your ass kicked.

353
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,440
And ultimately that's one of the
reasons how, one of the things,

354
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:26,580
when the motivations for people,

355
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:30,810
when they do like get upset at people for
liking other things, you know, if you,

356
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:34,730
if you actually love, what
do you like hot rods, what's,

357
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,630
what are you doing stupid? You're
like hot rods and big dogs big here.

358
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,090
But the people that say that
are always the, the like the,

359
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,790
if they're that critical about what you
enjoy is because they're less happy.

360
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,640
It takes you a while
to realize that though.

361
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:51,060
I thought they were right and they would
be angry and critical with me about

362
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:53,910
things and I would think that they were
right and I would say, wow, you know,

363
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,820
maybe I'm a, and then I would then
eventually it took me a while ago.

364
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,040
Why do they care?
It took me a while to go,

365
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,110
why are they giving me a hard
time for things that I enjoy?

366
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,190
If I like listening to kiss, I
like kiss. Yeah, I'll be in my car.

367
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,100
Come on and sing along.
I fucking sing along as you think.

368
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,820
I think most people don't get to that.

369
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,830
I think it is something you start
to figure it out as you get older.

370
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,010
But then I was having this
thought literally earlier today.

371
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,750
Don't you ever look back and think about
people that like we're in high school

372
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:24,060
with you,
that you feel like had that clarity,

373
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,680
but you don't realize it til you're older.

374
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:30,320
You're like that person's disposition
and they're credible at like 15. Yeah.

375
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,870
I think it's their parents.
Yeah.

376
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,220
And if you grow up in an environment
where your parents or your parents don't

377
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:38,980
buy the bullshit, it's way easier to not
buy the bullshit, you know? You know,

378
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,780
my parents were very unusual. My
Dad is, uh, my stepfather Hippie,

379
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,830
and he was a computer program
and then an architect is a very,

380
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,740
very bright guy who was always, you
know, a pot smoker too when I was young.

381
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah. Tell you like him or would you
smoke with him or smoked with him?

382
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:55,834
When I was eight.

383
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,280
Hey.
Hey,

384
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,090
just once to see what it was like. Cause
I asked him, I'm like, what are you doing?

385
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,360
We guys are smoking pot. What does that?
And he goes, you want to try it? And I go,

386
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,600
can I? He goes, yeah, it goes
just a little, but you can
try it. And they gave me,

387
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,850
I don't remember the effects.
I don't remember what happened.

388
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,800
Probably fucked my brain up from life.
Yeah.

389
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,110
But I was taught or really early
on to don't don't believe the hype.

390
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,970
You know that there's a, there's a lot
out there that's bullshit, you know? Yeah.

391
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,200
A lot of laws that he like I would,
I would give it,

392
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,530
I got confused about something being
illegal. I'm like, but it's illegal.

393
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:29,350
This is illegal. And you know,
my stepfather was always like,

394
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,490
let me tell you something. That laws
that are not there to protect people,

395
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,730
they don't, they don't need to be there.
Those are, those laws are nonsense.

396
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,250
And it was a,
it was a really interesting way he put it,

397
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,570
the laws that don't protect anybody or
just bullshit laws. And I was like, wow,

398
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,110
what the fuck ever thought like hitting.

399
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,130
Then it really is when you really start
to think about like personal choice laws.

400
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,820
Like I remember in New York he couldn't
get tattooed, like tattoos were illegal.

401
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,773
Like for awhile,

402
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,870
back in the 90s I had to go to Connecticut
to get a tattoo and I was like,

403
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:59,950
how fucking stupid is this? You know,
this is the one I grew up in in Boston,

404
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,770
kickboxing was illegal. We used to
have to go to Rhode Island to fight.

405
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,020
We can fight in taekwondo
tournament's in Massachusetts,

406
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,520
but we had to go to Rhode Island
to find like why? What did,

407
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,690
the more laws there are,
the more problems there are.

408
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,490
Let people figure out what the fuck
they like, let them pursue it. Cool.

409
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,330
We got way too much.

410
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,260
We have way too many laws and we have
way too many people that have a career in

411
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,240
pro.
Not just protecting these laws,

412
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,730
but enforcing these laws
and building more laws.

413
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,130
It's like there's a whole business.
It's like, well, you know,

414
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:29,730
where are we says people always
say kill the lawyers first. Oh No.

415
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,750
It's like it's really is ridiculous when
they can catch little imperfections in

416
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:35,541
the text,
in the,

417
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,800
in the language of things are written and
they can exploit these things and it's

418
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:43,210
like why is everything so fucking complex?
It is.

419
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,480
Or the the lawsuit. Yeah to sue somebody
over. You know in Hungary there's a,

420
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:51,800
there's an amusement park that other
roller coasters made out of wood and it

421
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,880
doesn't even stop to let you on.

422
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,940
That was from like the Russian and it's
the most fun and scary as Shit fucking

423
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,970
die.
And how slow does it go?

424
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:06,920
Does it get on maybe like five down to
five and you literally like the people in

425
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:10,850
it jump off and then the fucking bar
doesn't even come down on your lap.

426
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:14,350
It's like this and you better hold
the fuck on cause you're going to get,

427
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,900
well you think anybody sues the
amusement park if they fall up? No.

428
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:19,510
It's your fault dummy.
Who wrote the,

429
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,920
I think you should be able
to sue for certain things.

430
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,100
I certainly think they should
fix the fucking rollercoaster.

431
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,340
That that's not what I'm saying.

432
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,390
What I'm saying is that there's a lot
of laws like that that are in place that

433
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:30,490
just don't need to be right.

434
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,540
Sometimes things are just common
sense and public opinion and you know,

435
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:39,380
it's common sense and not buy crack. If
you want crack, you can get crack. Yeah.

436
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:42,840
Cracks, illegal use. No,
there's no crack. Uh, uh,

437
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,580
people that are out the street protesting
why crack isn't legal. There's nothing.

438
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,250
You know, there's no crack advocates.
There's no crack legislators, you know,

439
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,110
but you can go get it. If you want
to go get it, you can go get it.

440
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,540
You want to really, do you want to
arrest the guy who's selling it?

441
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,400
That's poor fuck that's
running around selling crack,

442
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,520
which you need to do is make treatment
centers and need to do is find out what

443
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:04,250
the fuck happened on this poor kid
that he thinks it's okay to sell crack.

444
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,490
You know? I mean, that's the real
fundamental problem. Anybody look,

445
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:10,660
I don't know anybody. If I said,
hey man, I'm gonna, we're gonna,

446
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,900
we're gonna sell something that makes
your Dick fall off. You know they,

447
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:15,500
they know it's going to
make their dick fall off,

448
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,350
but we're going to sell it anyway. Are you
down? He went down and make some money.

449
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,340
I don't know a single person that would
go, what make people's Dick fall off?

450
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:26,870
Fuck. So why? Why? If you wouldn't
do that, and would you sell crack,

451
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,970
then would you sell something
that's going to ruin people's lives?

452
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,310
Of course you wouldn't.
There's no way you would do that.

453
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:34,430
You'd nobody would want that over their
head. And even if it was a lot of money,

454
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,430
man, you'd consider it because
you really do hate to be broke.

455
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,820
You don't want to do anything.
Ultimately, that ruins lives.

456
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,170
So that's the real issue.

457
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:45,080
The real issue is why are these
people willing to sell crack?

458
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,120
Why are these people willing to put other
people's lives and put themselves and

459
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,600
their wants and their selfish desires
ahead of all these other people's lives?

460
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,940
There's, that's the real
prosperity. Real world,

461
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,930
not the crack is legal so that
anybody would want crack the rib.

462
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,020
Real root of the problem is not
the cracks illegal. It's that.

463
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,630
Why would anybody want crack?
That's the real problem. The

464
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,690
real problem is who's who's educating
the children, who's raising them,

465
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:14,120
who was exposing them certain
things she was protecting them.

466
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,650
Who's making sure that you
develop a person that doesn't
have anger and hate and

467
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,010
selfishness inside them to the point
where they want to sell people poison.

468
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,530
There's poison that they're addicted to.
A lot of shitty parents,

469
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,270
a lot of shitty parents, man. That is the
real root of the issue. That's the real,

470
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,460
real root of the issue to everyday.
You see it in adults,

471
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,010
you go and you can tell right
away like you had a really bad,

472
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,640
but you see it when you have kids and
your kids or run other people's kids.

473
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,390
You see people fucking scream at kids
when you know where they learn that shit

474
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:45,290
from. You know, you see them angry and
hit each other with sticks and shit.

475
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,930
You know, you see weird shit
with kids that you know is from,

476
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,080
it's going on at home.
Did you see that video of that lady,

477
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,760
young girl getting beat by her
father was a judge? I saw that dude,

478
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,100
you don't even want to watch it.
It's horrendous.

479
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,810
She was 16 at the time and her dad is
a judge in Texas and he had a family

480
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:08,020
planning judge and he beat her with
a belt for downloading shit off the

481
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:11,280
internet. I think she downloaded
some illegal stuff off the internet.

482
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,860
Like you know, the songs was a
music. So she downloaded illegal,

483
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,690
he beat her with a fucking belt.

484
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:22,100
I mean beat her like full
blast whips and he's yelling,

485
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:24,680
I didn't get my Lickin,
I didn't get my licking.

486
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,920
And this is a guy who did not
know he was recording. Right.

487
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:29,090
And we're being recorded, right?
So this is what this guy's like.

488
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,110
That's when it's really terrifying
when you see people behind their mask,

489
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,280
you know, this guy is, uh, his mask is
that he's a judge and bit, by the way,

490
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,140
they're not even going to
pursue charges against this guy.

491
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,710
This is the same statute.

492
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:46,170
And talk about laws or statue of
limitations on that kid. That's insane.

493
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,710
That's a assault.
One of the David just beating your kid.

494
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,180
We used a weapon like I should be
in jail forever. Fuck him. You,

495
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,420
you pussy. You hit a little
girl with a belt because what?

496
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,570
Because your life is frustrating because
you're getting old cause your Dick

497
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:02,020
doesn't work anymore.
Which is it?

498
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,970
Which is it that causes you to pull the
trigger on beating your fucking baby

499
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,910
with a belt?
Oh my God.

500
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,510
I would never stop hitting
that guy if I saw that happen.

501
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,130
I would never stop hitting that guy.
I would never run out of one more.

502
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,010
I would just keep giving them one more.
Fuck you.

503
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,100
You want to beat a baby
with a belt of girl?

504
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,340
You fucking piece of shit that that could
even be argued that that guy's not a

505
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:33,150
plague. A blight on society.
You fucking shithead.

506
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,010
You could do that to your
daughter, man. Shun you. You Fuck?

507
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,040
You should live on a mountain now.
No one should talk to you.

508
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,620
You should be locked up in a fucking cage.

509
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,530
Fuck you mad if files too for that.
Yeah.

510
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,370
This fucking the Sandusky thing.
It's a joke. Paternal thing.

511
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,520
Holy Shit is this dark.
You know what's really crazy?

512
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:57,610
The guy who found him and turn him in,
his name is Mick Query.

513
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,020
It's almost like this is fiction.

514
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,520
It's almost like the world is becoming
more and more one becoming as 2012 comes

515
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:09,690
along, the story falls apart.
The plot starts to reveal itself.

516
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,790
The writing behind the script.
Look,

517
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,080
the guy named wiener was a politician
who was sending pictures of his dick to

518
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,250
girls online and thought he
could get away with it. I mean,

519
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,860
what rush limbo takes so many
oxycontin's. He goes deaf. Why?

520
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,620
That was the best writes.
What? And His guy,

521
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,740
Macquarie finds the most beloved football
coach ever is guilty of shielding

522
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,220
another beloved assistant coach from
fucking little boys for 20 years.

523
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,560
This guy was taking these kids on fucking
trips. They were staying with him.

524
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,510
He was bone, a little boys for
years, and they allowed him to,

525
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,250
they allowed him to. Wow. Yeah.

526
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,610
I mean, I don't know what the
solution needs to be killed.

527
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,950
You have to kill them that they've
destroyed lives. I don't think.

528
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,570
I think people would forfeit their
right to live, reparable, destroyed.

529
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,530
All those boys.
That guy fucked will never be the boy did.

530
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:15,510
They could have been without
getting fucked by that guy.

531
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,540
That guy owes a hundred lives cause he
owes more than he owes 100,000 lives

532
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,930
because he goes every live to these poor
fucked up kids are going to interact

533
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,990
with and perhaps molests boys
because of what happened to them.

534
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,120
But that happens with that. That's why
it happens in the first place. ABS.

535
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,830
So this guy,

536
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,610
this motherfucker called it caused a
ripple effect and this Macquarie Guy who

537
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:39,000
still has his job, even though he didn't
go running to the police, you know,

538
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,980
everybody wanted to keep
their job, it seems, it

539
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,701
seems like they were,

540
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:44,580
they were shooting this guy and
everybody wanted to keep the job,

541
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:49,210
but the guy who saw the boy getting fucked
in the ass should a rent straight to

542
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,240
the police.
But that's not what happened.

543
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,860
They weren't fucking just horsing around.

544
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,920
They were just sliding on the floor.
Guys story is,

545
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:04,480
they heard a rhythmic slapping and came
in to see a 10 year old boy with his

546
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:07,990
hands on the wall. Well, this guy
was fucking his little boy ass.

547
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,260
Whoa. Did you see the development
today as far as the email? No.

548
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,280
So McCreary sent out an email to friends
and they had excerpts of it on the news

549
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,190
that said that he said,

550
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:26,080
you guys know I didn't just turn
and run away like they're saying I,

551
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,070
you know, I had to make quick
decisions. I made sure it stopped.

552
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,750
So he was saying that because there was
make sure it stopped but fall fucking

553
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,970
pedophile suggested that he entered
intervened at that moment. Uh, intervene.

554
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,710
Well stopped it. In other words, the
first reports said that he walked away.

555
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,190
Right. He and his email is saying I
didn't just see it and walk away. I,

556
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,280
I stopped it from, I stopped
what was happening. Okay.

557
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,340
So his old version, did he say
why he didn't go to the cops? No,

558
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:01,810
cause it's just they just got a copy of
an email he sent to friends. It doesn't,

559
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,090
it doesn't go into these,
how did he not go to the cops?

560
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,910
That's the part that people are saying
that he went to his father and then the

561
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,080
next day he went to his father.

562
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,340
He went to his own father to tell him
what happened and then the next day he

563
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:20,341
went to Puerto Rico and then Pitino
told the athletic director and maybe the

564
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:25,150
president or the athletic director told
the president was that guy as a guy

565
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:27,260
who's trying to keep his fucking job,
and that's pretty gross,

566
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,250
grows with that guy supposed to do
is called the cops. Immediately.

567
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:35,251
Everybody needs that call is to the
cop and you don't let that motherfucker

568
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,330
leave. Yeah, you don't let
that motherfucker leave.

569
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:39,220
You beat that old man's senseless.

570
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:43,450
You leave her there and then you call
the cops. Then old fucking creep.

571
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,160
Fucking that 10 year old boy,

572
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,460
you're supposed to want to be violent
because if you have a tribe, okay,

573
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,970
it's a tribe of a few people that they
care about each other and protect each

574
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:54,400
other from all the other fucking
terrible things in the world.

575
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,250
When you find something like that,
that's God damn disease.

576
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,780
The real problem is that we have so
many people, there's so many people,

577
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:05,620
there's 300 plus million of
us on this one continent.

578
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,180
And because of that, not
even one continent, one piece
of the contract in America,

579
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,480
you know, and because of that
we've, we devalue each other man.

580
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,500
We don't appreciate each other and we
don't appreciate threats like that.

581
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:21,790
Threats become over there.
They're a threat over there.
We can separate from it.

582
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,200
I live in a gated community.

583
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,740
I closed my door at night and turn
on my alarm system. I have a gun.

584
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,250
I'm not worried. You know, we, we, we
need to get rid of all those problems.

585
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,181
And if you,

586
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:35,530
if you had a community and you had a
guy like this paternal fuck who allowed

587
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:39,950
this other fuck to bang little kids in
the asshole and didn't have him locked in

588
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:40,010
a

589
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,800
cage, you're supposed to tell
the both of them. You are not,

590
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,840
you're not looking after the community.

591
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,910
You guys were looking
out for your own asses.

592
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,230
All of you from the guy who caught
him, who didn't go to the cops, to,

593
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,790
to the paternal guy knew.
They all fucking know.

594
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,070
You can't be around a dude who's
banging kids in the ass and not, no,

595
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:02,020
you cannot. How this guy's taking little
boys on the road with them. I mean,

596
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,310
it's really dark. He had a fucking, yes,

597
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,390
he had a charity to help little kids
that were like underprivileged or in, in,

598
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:12,170
you know, troubled homes. And you know,
it's the craziest thing. But there was a,

599
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,070
some priests that had written
some stuff about finding boys.

600
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,040
It was really dark shit.
And it was, um, uh,

601
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,260
like shared emails back and forth.

602
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,870
But one of the things that
they were saying was that,

603
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,750
look for boys with troubled childhoods.

604
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,900
Look for boys who don't have a good
relationship with their parents.

605
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,880
And those are the ones they prey on.

606
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,120
The boys who are lost and alone because
they're vulnerable and they'll do

607
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,880
anything for love, you know, and
they don't even know while they're,

608
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,820
while they're having sex with a man,
they just know that they're happy,

609
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:43,340
that this man cares about them
because the people, the orphanage,

610
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:47,060
don't you know that this man is
buying them toys. So he would do this,

611
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:50,240
he would buy them toys,
he would take them to fucking to games.

612
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:53,660
He would do all these things and bone
them. It's like classic priests Shit.

613
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,740
It's the classic preciate it

614
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:00,650
the level, the level of planning
an evil like it goes into,

615
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,810
I'm going to set up a foundation,

616
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,700
a charitable foundation for troubled and
we're trying them and were convicting

617
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:11,060
them right here on the show. And I
know that's wrong. We can assume,

618
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,220
I know that's wrong,
but if that Sandusky guy isn't,

619
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,500
if he's not well arrested and that the
Macquarie Guy, how is he not in jail?

620
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,410
I don't understand that.

621
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,680
That tell you since Sandusky didn't
do himself any favors with that, uh,

622
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,860
that interview that he did on air
yesterday with Bob Costas at all because,

623
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,260
oh my God. When like there's just, you
get it. Can you get it Brian? Pull it out.

624
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,970
Let's see. Yeah, I mean there's the,
first of all, they're stuffy volunteers,

625
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,390
which if you have doubts, you should
probably have far less doubts. Laughter.

626
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,050
It was on NBC. It was on a rock
center, uh, with Brian Williams.

627
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,120
Dusky yeah. It's um, there's
certain things like if,

628
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,020
I don't know it, was it Matt Lauer who,
no, it was Bob Costas. Oh, Bob Costas.

629
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,170
He's even better. He's
tremendous cautious. A
brilliant man. Very smart guys.

630
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,300
His grasp of the English language really
makes you feel, yeah. He's a great guy.

631
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,330
I don't know words. He beat me. He
beat me up on news radio. He did. Yeah.

632
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,220
We had seen a fight scene
was radio and he flipped me.

633
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,960
He flipped me off the ground.
He's bringing by us. He's
a brother. Yeah, we had,

634
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,600
I got a chance to talk to him all night.
It was really cool. Very smart guy. Well,

635
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:24,800
there's just things like,
I mean,

636
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,170
I don't know if we're going to get the
interview or not, but like when you,

637
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,660
you know, when you're
asked a, are you a pet,

638
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,180
are you sexually attracted to young boys?
What do you think?

639
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:36,080
Like somebody who isn't, what would they
say? What's, no fuck no. Okay. Well,

640
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:39,870
what about am I attracted sexually?

641
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,303
I mean,

642
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,070
I'm not sexually define attractive.
Yeah.

643
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,800
Can I just bring up an
Oprah Winfrey thing?

644
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:53,380
I learned on the Oprah show
the web is buzzing of the cost.

645
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:58,381
This is telephone interview with Jerry
Sandusky speaking for the first time.

646
00:35:58,981 --> 00:35:59,814
Since then.

647
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,930
It is then it seemed like it's a right,
it's a report on this is, this is not it,

648
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,550
the interview. No, they're talking about
the interview. Yeah. That's not it.

649
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,900
Obviously just look for the
interview. Yeah, the audio
is amazing. It's incredible.

650
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,990
Molested and uh,

651
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,680
and she had this whole segment where she
brought pedophiles on the show and they

652
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:22,040
actually got to say how
they court these children,

653
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,690
why they do it in any way. Basically
they groom children, like you said,

654
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:27,560
the vulnerable ones.

655
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:32,590
They can tell which boys or girls or
psychologically fragile and they groom

656
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:35,570
them. So like you said,
that's what that's called,

657
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:39,620
where they give them the candy and the
courtship and actually family members to

658
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:40,760
my last a lot.
She's like,

659
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:45,410
if you have an uncle that like is
really into hanging out with your girls,

660
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:49,220
like how loosened on my lab or that,
that's actually how it happens.

661
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:52,790
It's the neighbor, it's the
uncle. It's not the stranger.

662
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:56,000
It's actually people that, you
know, what the fuck is Redman?

663
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,680
I think it's like a faulty
products, you know? Is this,

664
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,820
it sounds like it

665
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,323
innocence,

666
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,650
completely innocent and falsely
accused in every aspect.

667
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,000
Good question. Well, I could say that, you
know, I have done some of those things.

668
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:19,340
I have horsed around with kids.
I have showered after workouts,

669
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,610
I have hugged them and I've,

670
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,060
I haven't touched her leg
without intent of sexual contact.

671
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,530
But, um, so if, if you
look at it that way,

672
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,710
um,
there are things that

673
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,330
wouldn't, you know, it would be accurate.

674
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,080
Are you denying that you
had any inappropriate sexual
contact with any of these

675
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:47,550
under race?

676
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,630
Boy, yes. I am

677
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,580
never touched their genitals. Never
engaged in oral sex. Right. Wow.

678
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,440
What about Mike Macquarie,

679
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:01,441
the Grad assistant who in 2002 walked
into the shower where he says in specific

680
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:06,781
be 10 or 11 years old that his hands
were up against the shower wall and he

681
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:09,340
heard rhythmic slap,

682
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:14,110
slap slapping sounds and he
described that as a rape.

683
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,850
I would say that that's false.

684
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,410
What would be his motive to lie?

685
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,570
You'd have to ask him that.

686
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,700
What did happen in the shower the night
that Mike Macquarie happened upon you

687
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:28,844
and the young boy.

688
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,620
Okay.
And we will rush showering and,

689
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,790
and horsing around and he actually
all the shower's on and was,

690
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,460
uh, actually sliding
across the, uh, the floor.

691
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:46,390
And, um, and we were, as I recall,

692
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:49,090
possibly like snapping a towel.
Horseplay

693
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,610
in 1998 mother confronts you about
taking a shower with her son and

694
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,050
inappropriately touching him.

695
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,420
Two detectives eavesdrop on
our conversations with you
and you admit that maybe

696
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,620
your private parts touched her son.
What happened there?

697
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,560
Well, I can't exactly
recall what was said there,

698
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,180
uh, in terms of, um,

699
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,520
what I did say was that

700
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,400
if he felt that way then I was wrong.

701
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,390
During one of those conversations,
you said,

702
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,880
I understand I was wrong.

703
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,580
I wish I could get forgiveness
speaking now with the mother.

704
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,670
I know I won't get it from you.
I wish I were dead.

705
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,390
A guy falsely accused or a guy whose
actions have been misinterpreted doesn't

706
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:44,810
respond that way.
Does he?

707
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,080
I don't know.
I didn't say to my recollection,

708
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,340
I wish I were dead. Uh, I,

709
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,550
I was hopeful that we
call the reconcile things.

710
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,430
Shortly after that in 2000,

711
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,030
a janitor said that he saw you
performing oral sex on a young boy in the

712
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:10,550
showers, in the Penn state
locker facility. Did that happen?

713
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,663
No.

714
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,160
How could somebody think they
saw something as extreme,

715
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:20,660
as shocking as that when it hadn't
occurred and what would possibly be their

716
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:21,990
motivation to fabricate it?

717
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,630
You didn't have to ask them.

718
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,200
It seems that if all of
these accusations are false,

719
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,760
you are the unluckiest and most persecuted
man that any of us has ever heard

720
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:35,594
about.

721
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,240
What you want me to say?

722
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,220
I don't think that these have
been the best days of my life.

723
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,700
Sandusky's attorney Joseph Amendola insist
the charges filed by the Pennsylvania

724
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:58,470
girl pregnant. You got a teenager
pregnancy a few days ago. Come out,

725
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,250
he 49 now you can kill it. 49 years
old. He got a teenager pregnant. Yeah,

726
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,470
it goes on. It goes on.
It's a of the feather,

727
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,320
but like doesn't let you think he's not.
I mean like if you're like,

728
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,680
I think you're totally right that
you, that you shouldn't, you know,

729
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,910
convict somebody just when charges.
But then like if you did have your doubts,

730
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,620
does that make them fade away? That this
guy's a creep? No. No question about it.

731
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:26,340
That's not how you respond. I of
course not you people that are guilty,

732
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:30,720
that are pretending to not be guilty, it
never realize how other people see them.

733
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,070
They always just tried to, you know, stay

734
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,810
calm and keep it together.

735
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,440
You would be freaking the
fuck out if that was you.

736
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,780
And all of a sudden someone was saying
that Thomson [inaudible] has been

737
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:46,340
touching little kids. I'm blowing him
in a bathroom. You would go crazy.

738
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,300
You wouldn't be, you'd have to ask
them. You wouldn't. You wouldn't.

739
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,810
There's no fucking way you would leave
it at. You'd have to ask them now.

740
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,440
He could be like, I have no idea.
This is horrifying. I, you know,

741
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,970
this is not only that, it's, it's,

742
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,650
it's put me in this terrible position
where it'll never be erased from some

743
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:07,120
people's memories that have heard this.
It's a terrifying thing. You know,

744
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,400
if you think someone falsely accusing
you of being a child molester like this,

745
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:12,830
you know, if someone was really
falsely accusing you would be,

746
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,820
you would be trapped. It'd be
like raging. You'd be like,

747
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,520
I haven't done anything.
What the fuck is going on?

748
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,350
And people have been falsely
accused before for sure.

749
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:25,070
I would like to see how they react
because then it doesn't sound like that.

750
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,290
Do you know of any popular cases?
I just assumed.

751
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:34,760
Oh Brian. I just assumed that
people have been, I mean especially,

752
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,040
I mean I'm sure it's happened
and molestation and murder
ones that always like

753
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,440
it blows my mind when you see like DNA
exonerates somebody and they serve.

754
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,470
Like that person was in prison for 20
years of their life in the hardcore prison

755
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:56,090
for like murders and rapes and
the whole time he was like,

756
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:58,640
I didn't murder somebody.
Everybody was like sure I can asshole.

757
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:03,750
Like I'm sure you didn't. Did you
see that guy that fought under card?

758
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,590
Oh my gosh, she's got no,
it wasn't mean. It wasn't,

759
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:12,170
it wasn't like a week or two before.
It was this guy was 52 years old.

760
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:16,250
He'd just gotten out of jail where he
was in jail for I think 29 years for a

761
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:17,630
crime he didn't commit.
He got

762
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,000
sad,
so scary.

763
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:28,001
He was boxing champ like inside and he
be one is to come back by 52 years old

764
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,970
professional box and you actually look
really good for a 52 year old is in good

765
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:35,530
shape
to,

766
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,270
I saw a piece on him before the fight
and just how he wasn't wanting to kill

767
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,530
everybody in the world even though like,

768
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,420
I can't imagine the anger
you got to have that you got,

769
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:49,820
how long would it take him to
be saying again? You know, man,

770
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,050
how long would it take him to bounce back?
That's a, that's a long Goddamn road.

771
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,000
Like a great attitude.

772
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:59,310
Way better attitude than people who
haven't served 29 years. Incredible.

773
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,150
I wonder how he pulled it together like
that. I Dunno. I really don't know. Yeah,

774
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,190
it's really sad.
That's,

775
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:10,191
and that's the one reason why I'm not
100% for capital punishment for capital

776
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,880
punishment when you absolutely
know. But the reality is, man,

777
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,590
there've been bad cops just like there've
been bad postmen, like there's been,

778
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,780
don't you think people would,
uh, not be like, you know,

779
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:23,780
there's a segment of people who oppose
the death penalty for crimes you can

780
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:26,030
commit now,
don't you think people would be,

781
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,380
there'd be less people opposed to it
if it were for like child molestation?

782
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,160
Like if you're like,
that's a punishable by death crime

783
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,200
now don't think less,

784
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,050
but you'd have to prove that the
person was 100% if they weren't,

785
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,920
if they were approved 100% yeah, people
would probably, well, you know what?

786
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:43,230
I think it would be harder to get
people to pull the trigger for trauma

787
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:45,900
molesting because a lot of people have
creepy uncles that they love that are

788
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:50,070
probably did. So there's,
I think it's more prevalent

789
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,330
in our society than we'd like to admit.

790
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:55,810
And it really is a symptom and a side
effect of the sexual repression that we

791
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:58,120
all enjoy in this country.
You know,

792
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,470
they're wired that way.
If you're a kink, is that,

793
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,870
it's unfortunate because how do
you express that cat? I think,

794
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,600
I think at the root of a lot of really
fucked up deviant behavior is a lack of

795
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:14,470
sexual choices and a lack of uh,

796
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,660
sexual education and a,
that the fact that it's dirty,

797
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:20,250
the fact that sex is forbidden,

798
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:22,860
the fact that it's something that you
feel like you're getting away with when

799
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:23,694
you do it.

800
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,080
And then you add to that fucked up people
that molest kids and he throw that all

801
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:32,130
in a big batch together and then you
have these kids that grow up with this

802
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:35,710
fucked up memory and they repeat the
same behavior over and over again.

803
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:37,170
And what is the root cause of it?

804
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,270
I mean all of it has got to
be like shitty parenting,

805
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,410
shitty parenting and the kid
being the less right. That's,

806
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,330
that's the root of all of it.
But also, you know, it has to,

807
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,080
there should be a little bit
more knowledge. We, we should,

808
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,710
we should be a little bit more open
about what the fuck is going on sexually

809
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,390
with people like in high school.

810
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,450
Do you think they have classes where they
talk about people that are trying just

811
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,160
trying to fuck you.
Do you think they have

812
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,590
class like that where they say,

813
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,020
Hey look this guy with candy and the
open van who's just trying to fuck you so

814
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:05,900
you understand he may just
trying to fuck you in your ass.

815
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,980
Wouldn't it be great to tell like 10
year olds really should know right there

816
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,700
cause otherwise the first time they
get raped or like what the fuck

817
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,710
drug,
drug resistance education.

818
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,700
All it did was teach me what drugs I
wanted to do when I was old enough to do

819
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:24,110
them.
It didn't really teach me shit.

820
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:26,470
Remember when you had to pass
around the fake drugs that look like

821
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,120
actually was real stuff that the police
had confiscated and you're like sitting

822
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:35,930
there looking at real weed when you were
like 12 going wow this is cool looking

823
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,880
but I've never seen this plant so my
brother's gone wouldn't have been more

824
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,310
valuable if they were like, hey if some
guy tries to fuck you in a van run.

825
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,720
But there used to be,
don't ever trust any,

826
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,770
any adults by themselves and wants
to take you somewhere. Danger,

827
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,530
danger, danger. Don't talk to strangers.
Don't open the door if you're alone.

828
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,010
So there is every now and then

829
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,550
you'll see someone somewhere.

830
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:04,660
So I'm fucking sketchy looking
at person and you just,

831
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,190
but it is, I do think it is the,
uh, it is the like unacceptable,

832
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,290
unfixable kink. It is like,
I think it's like pro,

833
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,870
there's hard wiring and there
are some products that you like,

834
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:17,210
this thing was done fucking broken.

835
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,320
It's a broken person and there's really
no cause everything else. If you're like,

836
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:25,530
this is what arouses me there, you can
get your, but this is the one that's like,

837
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,070
I can't, sorry. Yeah, you can't. And it's
a psychological too. It's my, it might

838
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,550
not even be sexual. So like making them
impotent might not even do it. Right.

839
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,870
They might still want to touch the
kids and do, who knows? I don't know.

840
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:40,780
I don't know if it's psychological
or it's just purely sexual, you know?

841
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:45,130
I think it's a, it's a weird fucking
obsession. Yeah. Terrifying. Terrible,

842
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,600
terrible obsession. You know, and it's, it
needs to be fixed. It needs to, you know,

843
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,220
someone needs to figure
out a way to fix that.

844
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,860
I think probably there is a
way with psychedelic drugs,

845
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,060
but they haven't pursued it enough to
figure out like what's the right dose and

846
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:01,000
how to administer it correctly.
Like if you give someone like a,

847
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:03,700
if someone's like a child molester or
someone's done something fucked up and you

848
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:04,810
give them like a heavy,

849
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,520
heavy dose of Iowasca or heavy dose
of Ibogaine or something like that,

850
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,730
my guarantee you there'd
be so disappointed and
disgusted with themselves.

851
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,210
They do, they kill themselves
or they would never ever
do it again. Really? Yeah,

852
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,570
I think so. I think, uh, I think
that's true with a lot of people,

853
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,800
a large percentage of the population.
I think most people, you know,

854
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,950
like when a guy said he wanted to kill
himself, I wish I was dead, you know,

855
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,790
that's what they think.
That's what they think. They,

856
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,190
they don't want to live this way.

857
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,500
They're just stuck in this
goddamn feedback loop,

858
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,230
this horrible loop that they
got in as a small child.

859
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,670
That Sanduski guy's probably
molested Williams a kid. Yes, sure.

860
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:42,160
Probably by another football coach or
something like that that I saw a story

861
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:42,994
that uh,

862
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:48,220
his parents started like a home for kids
and he lived in that home growing up.

863
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,130
Oh, Bingo. Well there you go.
That's where he got it. Yeah. Yeah.

864
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:53,920
He got it either from one of those
kids that he went to in the home with,

865
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:55,420
cause a lot of those had been molested.

866
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,300
If you're going to share a home
with troubled children. Yeah.

867
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:03,100
A lot of their troubles or
sexual, you know, God damn it
man. Yeah. God Damn it man.

868
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,150
Yeah.
And you know what,

869
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,770
while this fucked up country is overseas
steel and heroin and minerals in

870
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:11,440
Afghanistan and pretending
that it's for our greater good,

871
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,470
they could be over here and trying to
fix the real problem in this country,

872
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:17,740
which is fucking the youth. The
real problem is, are the, the, the,

873
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,120
the quality of our fucking plants that
are growing, the quality of our seeds.

874
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:22,931
That had been planted,

875
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:25,480
the quality of the human beings
that are developing right now,

876
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,580
and for a good percentage of them,

877
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:31,810
it's a fucking mess and
no one wants to fix that.

878
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:35,800
Could you imagine if we had an entire
country of people that lived in a good

879
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:36,634
neighborhood,

880
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,940
the entire country of people that lived
in a place where you didn't have to

881
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:43,320
worry about your kids getting
fucked by some creepy man, you know,

882
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,170
in the Netherlands even
there. Awesome. Well sort of,

883
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,000
but even there that look
the Netherlands in Holland,

884
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:50,650
a lot of crazy shit goes on in Holland.

885
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,670
You know how is a dark place globe
trotters know enough about it. Yeah.

886
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:56,920
The Red Light district,
all those words just

887
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,670
for tourists.
I don't think that the native Dutch,

888
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:02,830
I was just there like a few weeks ago
and just stand up out there. Yeah. Yes.

889
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,320
For like some, some showtime thing and
there was, the natives were saying like,

890
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,700
we don't go to those places.

891
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:13,470
The Dutch were actually conservative
people socially or it's a business thing.

892
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:16,740
They realize that that's what
attracts us. Dopey Americans. Woo.

893
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:20,190
You can smoke dope in public and
we can fuck hookers. And it's so,

894
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,790
it's so crazy to us how we can have
sex and we can do all these things and,

895
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:28,100
and that's why we go over
there and do that. Or an

896
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,980
English boy hall is not an innocent
place though by any stretch of the

897
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:34,410
imagination run wild ass place to,
you know,

898
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,850
do you know that's where some of the
best kickboxing and the world comes from?

899
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:43,430
Is that Dutch? Yeah. Yeah.
Boy Tie in in Holland.

900
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,260
Is that some of the
highest level in the world?

901
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:48,500
A lot of fighters from other countries
go to Holland to train in kickboxing.

902
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,980
I had no idea. Yeah,
there's a great culture,

903
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,150
great culture of a kickboxers from that
part of the world that there was a few

904
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:02,420
guys back in the day and you know, there's
a bunch of them that came successful.

905
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:05,720
It's particularly this Guy Ramon Dekkers
who went over to Thailand and fought

906
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:09,320
like the best ties in the world.
And he was a small guy.

907
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:10,610
So he's the size of the ties.

908
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,630
And then there was a guy named rob
came in and rob came in was a larger,

909
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,810
bigger guy. You met rob, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a bigger guy.

910
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:20,510
It's like it would hurt. He's, he probably
the best kickboxer that ever lived.

911
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,950
Really? Yeah. And he's a
real super technical and he's
from, from Holland as well.

912
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:28,730
They're all crazy. They're wild wild
people, man. Yeah. To Fund people.

913
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,250
Did you see that sports science on
Bas Rutten's kicks? Oh yeah, yeah.

914
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,030
Ridiculous. They were like,
this is all wrong. All the
readings are off. He'll hurt.

915
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,970
And then he did it again.
Your insights are being traumatized.

916
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,310
Paint if you get kicked by this guy,
oh yeah.

917
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,760
Boss route and can kick fucking hard.
And he was one of the first guys in, uh,

918
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,640
in mixed martial arts fighting.

919
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,920
It was really fighting in an
organization called pancreas,

920
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:55,310
which was sort of a hybrid.
It wasn't quite mixed martial arts.

921
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:59,690
He had weird rules. You could kick full
blast but you couldn't punch to the face.

922
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,490
You could only slap to the face.

923
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:04,370
You get to like pull your hands
back and use open palm strikes.

924
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,150
But with boss route and figured out
how to do is pull his hands way back,

925
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,320
had like really flexible risks. So
really it was punching you with his palm.

926
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,720
So because with most guys
they were like slapping,

927
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:17,770
which doesn't have the same impact,
but boss was doing,

928
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,710
he was pulling his hands way back
like this and he was throwing punches.

929
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:24,500
He was the first guy to figure out that
he could throw punches with his palms

930
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:29,450
and he was fucking people up. You would
kick them and you would just go, whoa,

931
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:32,270
nobody kicks that hard. In
the, in this style of fighting,

932
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:36,440
he was kicking like a real powerful
Moy Thai guy would kick anybody who was

933
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:41,420
applying that in MMA. He was one of the
first guys. One of the first pioneers.

934
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,750
Yeah. It's a crazy God damn sport. The
sport of fighting. It's crazy to brag,

935
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:50,700
but I studied Kung Fu for two years,
Susan Griffith Park and I'm like, Gee,

936
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,670
I did. My teacher taught
us, says Muy Thai kicks,

937
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:00,250
and she said that they get like callouses
on their shins sort of deal. Yeah.

938
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,240
They get kind of numb. A lot of guys have
like bumps in knots and shit from me.

939
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,720
You know, you get like bloody spots and
bruises and the heal up and gets tough.

940
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:12,410
Eventually. Some guys even kick a
bamboo trees and shit. The cake,

941
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,030
banana trees and the kicker
just to kind of, you know,

942
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:19,670
it Kinda has some give to it,
but it's still pretty hard.

943
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,230
It does feel good to kick stuff hard.
God dammit.

944
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,830
Just dammit.
Just

945
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,700
do you think about Tom Mommy? It's
just, Oh yes. Whatever. No I don't.

946
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:31,830
I don't treat you like the enemy.
I don't have any.

947
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:36,110
How come you guys get along
so well as a couple as comics?

948
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,590
Because a lot of them like
you guys are genuinely happy.

949
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,900
Neither one of you guys just
like tortured, you know, and you,

950
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,700
you seem like better together.
You actually seen better together.

951
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:48,380
We all have the friend that when they're
with their other, they're different. Oh,

952
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:52,640
I know. Isn't that sad? Sad? I think
it's sad to watch. Yeah. I have a,

953
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:55,410
I have a buddy that can't do anything
right. When he's with his girl.

954
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:57,710
She's always, what are you putting
it there for? What? What does that,

955
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,820
why is it going to be here? Sit down.
What time is it? You are you ready? Yeah,

956
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:06,470
always. There's always a nag in there.
But you guys are like buddies. Yeah.

957
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,310
You know why though?
I think some women,

958
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,300
they make their spouse the enemy for some
reason they're unhappy with something

959
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:16,010
inside of them. But with
Tommy I think, I dunno,

960
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,660
I'm in therapy. I go to psychotherapy.
Yeah. When I work out my shit and I,

961
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:25,590
you know, I do it professionally and
also like, cause we're both comics.

962
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:26,430
Like I just did.

963
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,640
I think Tommy is way funnier than me and
I accept that and I like him commute.

964
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,220
I mean like I respect you as a
comic and I respect you as a person.

965
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,240
Yeah. So that's why, you know, as long
as he's the fucking man. Yeah. Dude,

966
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:42,690
it's awesome. Right? No. You Kiss,

967
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,430
you just kissing, all sang. Yeah. What
are you going to say? Maybe around man,

968
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:51,570
they just,
oh those are cute.

969
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,320
No,
but that was beautiful.

970
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,790
You know what other thing that people
ask me all the time, they're like,

971
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:00,540
are you guys a competitive?
And I'm like, what? No.

972
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,500
Like I guess cause comics sort of
inherently are competitive but like, yeah.

973
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,680
In a relationship that's way different.
Yeah.

974
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,740
Some people that's their whole thing,
their whole thing.

975
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:12,890
The female comedians are
considered novelty acts. Like I'm,

976
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,590
I think there's still enough sexism
in comedy where people were like,

977
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:20,670
are you guys ready for a lady comic?
And I'm like, the circus act right.

978
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:22,400
In a normal lineup. So, uh,

979
00:55:22,401 --> 00:55:25,720
my career and what I'm trying to say
is never going to conflict with Tommy.

980
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,710
He's like,
it's preposterous to think that

981
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:32,820
we're controlling for the
same. No one competes with
it. Right. And that too. Yeah.

982
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,030
You have to realize that
somewhere along the line that you,

983
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,470
when your friends do better, you do
better everybody together. But you,

984
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,970
y'all go grow together.

985
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,000
But everybody gets fucking selfish and
they don't want their friends. I mean,

986
00:55:43,001 --> 00:55:44,770
I know a lot of comics that,
I mean,

987
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:48,310
we all know a lot of comics that they
don't like the other people around them.

988
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,320
To be funny.
Oh sure.

989
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,720
You want to hold everything everybody
back because somehow or another they feel

990
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:55,390
like it makes them not funny.
You know?

991
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:58,380
Like I remember I had a conversation
with somebody and they were saying, wow,

992
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,320
fuck, do you take Joey d as in a row
with Umass? So funny. He's so funny.

993
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,900
He's ridiculous. I was like,
cause he's hilarious. Yeah,

994
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,110
we'll kind of stupid question is
that like, but to them it was,

995
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,630
there was ridiculous. Like what
they did, and this was a headliner.

996
00:56:10,631 --> 00:56:14,290
I was talking to a national guy and
what he does is take a fucking terrible

997
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:15,230
comedian on the road with them.

998
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,880
And a terrible comedian would go on there
and eat his own dick for 20 minutes.

999
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:19,900
And then he'll go out,
look,

1000
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:23,050
our goddamn hero who rescue
at the bar has been lowered.

1001
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,460
People are looking to laugh. So he has a
couple inferior comedians on before him.

1002
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:30,640
And then he goes out there and he looks
like a fucking Superhero, you know?

1003
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,260
But when they see someone doing well,

1004
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,570
they start thinking
these terrible thoughts.

1005
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:37,600
This person's gonna ooze usurped my power.
They're going to,

1006
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,770
people are going to be seeing them.

1007
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:42,370
I'm going to be opening them up for
him and they start thinking crazy, man.

1008
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,700
And it's crazy. It's stupid. It's
a dumb thing to do. It's a trap.

1009
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,500
You can never be jealous.

1010
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:51,340
You can only be inspired if you
want to feel any negativity.

1011
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:55,810
Just fucking push it aside, ignore
it, rejected, refuse it and just say,

1012
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:59,550
man, how awesome is that guy? I
wish I was that funny. You know,

1013
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,940
I'm going to write more. You
know, I want to go do this.

1014
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,440
I think that both Christina and I both
always been the type of person that likes

1015
00:57:08,111 --> 00:57:09,580
having funny people around.

1016
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:14,020
Like we genuinely enjoy funny
people and we never like,

1017
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,370
even when they're like huge personality,

1018
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:20,590
cause neither one of us has huge like
overbearing personalities. The people.

1019
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,770
So especially like offstage
when I'm around like,

1020
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:26,770
well I feel like when I'm
around like Joey Diaz,

1021
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,070
like a fucking movie is playing like
somebody who's pressing play on fucking

1022
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:34,620
funny movie. How am I not going to like,
I'm going to watch him. I said, I've,

1023
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,680
I've been at your shows were, um, were
backstage. I pull up a chair and I'm like,

1024
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,660
so have you ever been asked him a
question? Have you ever been to Phoenix?

1025
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:46,310
And he's like, Phoenix. And he starts on
us and we tell you something about it.

1026
00:57:46,311 --> 00:57:49,140
We were robbing us.
Guy Phoenix are like,

1027
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,410
[inaudible] don't want a cap gun and
fly on his ass. Yeah. Like, I mean,

1028
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,370
you ended up, my nose was bleeding
those up for three days. You know,

1029
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,920
this dog deposes gone. Not only
is it like, not threatening,

1030
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:04,090
it's like the biggest joy of a
night or you ask stupid Burke.

1031
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,583
Yeah.

1032
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,840
And he tells you, it's like,
he's like having a fucking TV on.

1033
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,680
How about a show going on? Constantly.
Yeah. That's how I feel about it though.

1034
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,200
We always, I always feel like Joey's
like a show that we bring with us.

1035
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:21,370
He brings the party, he brings the party.
That's why he goes up first to, yeah.

1036
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,890
I mean, he's a goddamn national
headliner. You know what I mean? Joey,

1037
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,630
Joey's one of the best comics in
the country. And he goes on first.

1038
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,610
And the reason why it goes on for,
cause he wants to,

1039
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:32,210
he wants to go out there dancing and he
brings a party, you know, and he likes it.

1040
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,480
And he also likes the challenge of
warming a room up. You know, it helps,

1041
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:39,290
it makes it material stronger.
Joey's really calculated about his comedy.

1042
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,490
You know, you would think that being
this wild, crazy guy that he, you know,

1043
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:47,130
he's Kinda just kind of wings it, but
he also thinks about it a lot. You know,

1044
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:50,120
he has a lot of thought behind
his comedy and he, you know,

1045
00:58:50,121 --> 00:58:52,880
he thinks that it's good for your
comedy to go up cold like that.

1046
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:56,210
He likes to do it for sure. You know what
I'm saying? He used to do it in Boston.

1047
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,870
Yeah. I was just talking to a buddy about
this. Like they used to do a a night,

1048
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:04,190
like they would do like dawn Gavin's
show and Don Galvin was a national

1049
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:06,560
headliner and one of the
biggest acts in Boston.

1050
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,330
And he would go on stage first and it
was his show and he would be the host of

1051
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:12,050
the show.

1052
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,870
And so he would bring up like if we did
like we're going to do Thursday night at

1053
00:59:14,871 --> 00:59:18,110
the icehouse again this week. So if
you're around, come on down bitches.

1054
00:59:18,111 --> 00:59:21,170
Cause it's a party. It's an
awesome show. It's a really,

1055
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:25,030
really intimate only 85 seats
and a it sold out last week.

1056
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,350
It'll probably saw it this week too.
And who else is doing it? Brian,

1057
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:31,070
I'm going to announce the whole lamp
tomorrow by John Reape is going to do it.

1058
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:34,880
Your friend Yoshi and I got some
other secrets to hilarious dude.

1059
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,310
It was a blast. So fun. So
cool. Yeah, this is awesome.
As crowd the best. Yeah. Yeah.

1060
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,820
Just the best. They're on board from
the first minute. Yeah. They're so cool.

1061
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,460
You know I, that's the, the,

1062
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,430
the greatest joy to me is that
whenever I go to comedy clubs,

1063
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,830
people always say how nice my crowds are.
That they're nice and generous.

1064
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:55,560
I hear that all the time. Everywhere. Like
they were so nice. They tip, they try it,

1065
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,860
they know how to drink, they fucking
keep it down and an amateurs. No. Um,

1066
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:03,230
so, but like you say, this show that
we're going to do Thursday night,

1067
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,990
if we're going to do it in Boston, I
would go on first, it would be like the,

1068
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:10,640
the Joe Rogan show and I'd go out and I
bring all these different people up and

1069
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,130
then at the end he'd do like 15 minutes,
20 minutes,

1070
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:15,740
whatever it is and close it out.
So that's what the guys would do.

1071
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,710
They would do a little bit
in the beginning and then
they would fuck around in

1072
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:23,530
between each act. They would fuck around
and do that Thursday, no way to do it.

1073
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:29,500
And does that take the steam
away from being a headliner men?

1074
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:30,820
I think it goes a little bit,
yeah.

1075
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,060
Awesome. I think it takes the steam away
from a set cause I want to see someone,

1076
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:37,390
when I see a guy, when it gets a Stan hope
or David towel or something like that,

1077
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:39,520
I want to see a 45 minutes set.
Plus,

1078
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:41,890
I want to say like an hour or
something like that. Because when you,

1079
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:46,110
when you see like a 45 minute set or an
hour set, then you see a real set. Yeah.

1080
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,960
You see the,

1081
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,960
you get to fully sink in the experience
of them shifting subjects and building

1082
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,640
momentum and changing gears. And it's
all this one thing. You know, it's,

1083
01:00:56,641 --> 01:01:00,070
it's like seeing an Avatar in
two chunks, you know? It's like,

1084
01:01:00,071 --> 01:01:01,840
you know what I mean? Like you
wouldn't want to do that. You'd want,

1085
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:03,790
it's a great movie,
but you'd want to watch the whole thing.

1086
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:07,510
It'd be just as good if it, I mean, you
probably enjoy it still if somebody,

1087
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:10,690
you know, put an Adam Sandler movie on
for 20 minutes in the middle of Avatar,

1088
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:14,800
but it wouldn't be the same. I'm not
ever calling my act Avatar, but you know,

1089
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:18,730
it's a, I think anything you
do where you're, you're fully,

1090
01:01:18,731 --> 01:01:22,270
wholly concentrated on that moment, you
know, I think it would make it better.

1091
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,630
Sure. So I don't, I don't
like doing it. Right.

1092
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:29,190
No thank you. Find that's the key. Like,
I mean, I, I, we always talk about this,

1093
01:01:29,191 --> 01:01:34,191
that how some comedians become
so well loved and so successful.

1094
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:38,220
Like Larry the cable guy, I love
shitting Dick Jokes. All right?

1095
01:01:38,221 --> 01:01:39,870
I'm not above any of that,

1096
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,130
but I think his fans and people that
love him just want to hang out with that

1097
01:01:44,131 --> 01:01:46,890
guy. Right? Like it's
friendly and it's, yeah.

1098
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:51,570
It's like you want to be around that
guy for 45 minutes in here and be in his

1099
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:56,010
world. It's not necessarily who's the
best craftsmen of the wording of the joke.

1100
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:59,540
It's your essence. It's, you know, that's
totally true. He was a human being, right?

1101
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,840
Yeah. And I've heard people say that he's
racist and I've heard people say, well,

1102
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:08,410
he has some jokes, racial jokes,
but what the fuck you, you know,

1103
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,520
this is the real issue.

1104
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:12,280
The real issue is why we live in a
world that everyone's so goddamn fucking

1105
01:02:12,281 --> 01:02:15,400
sensitive. You still a joke about
everything and anything, you know,

1106
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,590
especially these radical Muslim fucks.

1107
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,910
These guys have really got everybody
a corner because he can't even draw

1108
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:23,190
Muhammad. You draw Mohammad,
they want to stab you.

1109
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:27,580
Like really dude going to draw your guy
and he can't even draw and what have you

1110
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,930
drawn real good like this is,
you know,

1111
01:02:29,931 --> 01:02:33,540
it's like Leonardo Davinci wants to draw
Muhammad, he can't, you got to shoot him.

1112
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,540
Come on Bro. That's ridiculous.
You guys are being ridiculous.

1113
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,840
You should be able to tell when
you cut humor out of the equation,

1114
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:41,370
when you're your society's humorless,

1115
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:43,760
when there's things that
are off off subject you,

1116
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:46,500
you cut out all lines of inquiry,

1117
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,790
you cut out like real observing,
you cut you,

1118
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,480
and then you force everybody to sort of
subscribe to a predetermined pattern of

1119
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:58,080
behavior that's politically
correct because unless you
can tell jokes about shit,

1120
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,060
then I don't know.

1121
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:02,430
I mean you might tell a
joke about something that's
absolutely horrible and it's

1122
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:05,280
not funny at all.
But in trying,

1123
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,560
you test the waters and you know,

1124
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:11,400
sometimes there's some poor posture shit
going on and if you say people can't

1125
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:15,240
joke about it and then one guy does joke
about it and fucking knocks it out of

1126
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:18,510
the park and everybody's Howlin
guess what? That guy had joked about.

1127
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:21,090
It's got to a point and you might not
want to deal with that point because

1128
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:24,630
you're living in a fucking fantasy world
where you want everybody to not talk

1129
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:28,130
about your particular subject, you
know, whatever the fuck it is, what it,

1130
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:31,290
whatever it is, whatever taboo
you got going on inside your head,

1131
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,300
whether it's religion or sexual or
whatever, whether it's, you know,

1132
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:38,460
saying certain words or whether it's,
you know,

1133
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,740
saying you don't believe in
God whenever the fuck it is.

1134
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,940
If you say that someone can't
draw Muhammad and someone
can't make a south park,

1135
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,030
they couldn't even make a cartoon where
they pretended they were going to draw

1136
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:50,760
Mohammed. I mean, what was
the full extent hummus?

1137
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,040
Hamad was actually on South Park. He was
the early days early for this. Right.

1138
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,470
And then the second one, he was at
black bar. Then they stopped him from,

1139
01:03:58,471 --> 01:04:01,050
they stop them from putting
Muhammad on again. Right, right.

1140
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:04,920
And they made them do it
at like he, Mohammed was a
teddy bear. All right. Yeah,

1141
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:08,250
he was a, he was a weird look and tell
him. Yeah. Yeah. I can't remember.

1142
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:11,040
But it was some ridiculous shit where
they were when they were being threatened

1143
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:14,340
where they like, you know those guys?
Yeah. But I don't remember that.

1144
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:14,940
That was a while ago.

1145
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,420
They were being threatened and I know
that one people have been killed for it

1146
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,960
and it was at one woman that had to
change her identity because she tried to

1147
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:26,370
make a certain day draw Mohammed Day.
Yeah.

1148
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,181
You know,

1149
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:30,450
and she kind of went on and went deep
with it and thought she was being cute and

1150
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:32,850
they're like, bitch will cut
your fucking head off. You know,

1151
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:37,350
you want to play cute. My appeal to
my radical Muslim friends please.

1152
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,530
The Path that you're taking me cutting
people's heads off for drawing your guy

1153
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,360
is not that good one. Okay. You don't
need to concentrate on such silly things.

1154
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:48,300
This is a crazy way of doing it of course.
But the problem is man,

1155
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:51,290
that part of the world has
a lot of shit and it's in,

1156
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:56,100
it's in an environment that has been
there for 10,000 years and it's very

1157
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,570
difficult to change things.

1158
01:04:57,571 --> 01:05:01,870
The best way to change things like the
way America change things by moving move.

1159
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,220
Everybody moved here a few hundred
years ago from somewhere else,

1160
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:09,960
and then this was the, the the next stage
of change. Right. But if you go, you know,

1161
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:14,500
if you live in a place where there's not
that much physical change in, you know,

1162
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:17,750
and over the hundreds of
hundreds of years, it's

1163
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,240
the Middle Ages there.

1164
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:24,040
I was there in July and it's literally
just like shitty brick walls and just

1165
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:26,530
like mud huts and then
the woman in the Burka,

1166
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,270
and if your husband really loves you,

1167
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:33,250
he builds a wall around your backyard
so the wife doesn't have to wear a burka

1168
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:35,610
while she's doing chores in the backdrop.

1169
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,980
It's like it's the year 1300 they're very,
yeah,

1170
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,730
he said they catch a man fucking boys.
That's right. Yeah, that's what they say.

1171
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,710
That's the room. The oil rig, the oil rig.

1172
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:52,000
Oh yeah,
man.

1173
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:56,860
I did a show in between Iran and
Iraq on an oil rig oil platform.

1174
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,650
It was a mile long,
half,

1175
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:04,270
half Iraqi soldiers and half US marines
and the marines were teaching the Iraqis

1176
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:06,880
to guard their oil.
And uh,

1177
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:10,900
so I was sleeping on this tanker and it
smelled of gasoline all night and you

1178
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:15,310
would see the spot while they stink too.
Yeah.

1179
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:19,420
But uh,
you would see spy ships roll up anyway,

1180
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:21,900
I got to tour the Iraqi metrics.
Yeah.

1181
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,380
They try to black like Iran
would pull up their tank

1182
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,460
and they would have the word
Iran on the side of the boat,

1183
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,160
but then they would like black it out.
Like with black paint.

1184
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,340
We are not deer run.
I pictures,

1185
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,580
I will show you the pictures pull
up to this shit and we sold it.

1186
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:42,870
Yeah.

1187
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,530
So they're spying on us.

1188
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:49,531
Training the Iraqis and I got to
tour the Iraqi barracks and uh,

1189
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:53,170
it's first of all, I mean it's
just, it's completely, look, we're,

1190
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:56,830
we're really great at being military.
The Americans have that shit down.

1191
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:59,470
Like the Marine Corps is,
we're fucking real.

1192
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:04,330
And they're back throw just wires,
loose water bottles loose.

1193
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:08,890
They would take shits in over the
hang their ass over the oil platform,

1194
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,980
take a shit in the water
and then fish in the water,

1195
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:16,210
they just shit in and then eat
the fish and they a lot of water,

1196
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:21,260
I dunno man.
And as a seasoning,

1197
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,880
those guys eat it would probably taste
pretty good, but it's not bright to,

1198
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,390
to,

1199
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:31,390
to fish where you don't think they can
shit that much to have shooting a sudden

1200
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:35,380
they shit around.
Really thinking what else?

1201
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:39,120
Well,
here's another thing.

1202
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,650
Oh there's probably how many guys
were on the $50 hundred dollars?

1203
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,150
No more than 500.

1204
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:49,020
[inaudible] here's the thing too is like,

1205
01:07:49,451 --> 01:07:51,800
if like if you're,
if you shit,

1206
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,510
where'd you shit last night. Oh,
right here. A spot. Don't fish there.

1207
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,380
Okay.

1208
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,320
So I went to lick their there,

1209
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:09,240
the rent and they had mattresses
that were folded dirty,

1210
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:12,030
dirty mattresses up against
like this wall. And I was like,

1211
01:08:12,031 --> 01:08:15,030
what are the mattresses? Four?
And uh, the guy was like, well,

1212
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:19,040
it's a thing called man love Thursdays
because Thursday is there Friday.

1213
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:22,370
I forget what it is. And,
and he's, they say, what did
they put the mattresses down?

1214
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:27,530
And then the guys, they fuck each other
on the mattresses. And I know, I mean,

1215
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:31,220
who knows if that's just like a
speaking douche bags, I don't know.

1216
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:34,550
But he also said that he
broke up fights where one guy,

1217
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,700
like I'm saying like Americans being
like in the Rockies are a bunch of homos.

1218
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:43,930
Yeah.
And then,

1219
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:47,120
but then I had a commander telling me a
story where he had an Iraqi soldier like

1220
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:52,070
pound on his door at two in the morning
and the guy had bite marks in the back

1221
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,310
and on his back and he was
bleeding from these bite marks.

1222
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:57,920
And finally the commander to do that.

1223
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,090
He thinks some guy was trying
to fuck him and he, you know,

1224
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:05,050
wasn't allowing and the guy bit his back.
So you know,

1225
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,510
the homosexuality from my
understanding is that it's situational.

1226
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,840
Homosexuality were like,
because they can't date women and you,

1227
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,270
you have to just get married that,
you know,

1228
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,030
they choose men because of
the situation they're in.

1229
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:23,230
And it's not gay, it's not
considered gay. It's just like, okay,

1230
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,750
it's totally swollen.
They don't consider themselves gay.

1231
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:29,840
They can just consider themselves
really into fucking, yeah,

1232
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:33,300
you're just just whatever.
Yeah, whatever happened.

1233
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,400
Those who don't want it well,
yeah.

1234
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:42,080
In places like Saudi in there too, they,
yeah, I'm pretty sure it's prevalent.

1235
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,980
It's a really,
it is and it's so foreign and as a,

1236
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:53,150
as a Westerner and you really,

1237
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:57,050
I try to be open minded and wrap my
head around their culture and there are

1238
01:09:57,051 --> 01:10:01,060
certain ways they treat women that I'm
just like, Yo, I'm not really sure is

1239
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,860
that as far as we know,
and we'll, you know,

1240
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:07,080
there's a lot of debate about when
the beginning of civilization was,

1241
01:10:07,081 --> 01:10:11,880
but as far as we can tell it was there
as far as we can tell. There was in Iraq,

1242
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,870
Sumeria. Mesopotamia. Yeah,

1243
01:10:13,871 --> 01:10:17,310
and that's where the first
written language first
mathematics are attributed to

1244
01:10:17,311 --> 01:10:20,820
these guys. They're the first,
any, any knowledge whatsoever.

1245
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:24,450
It was strongly or astrology.
They had the constellations mapped out.

1246
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:27,510
They had a different astrological signs.

1247
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:30,480
They had 13 I believe instead
of the 12 is that correct?

1248
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:35,670
I think that's something
like that. Anyway, I don't
remember how many they are,

1249
01:10:35,671 --> 01:10:39,900
but what the point was with these people
like had this really amazingly advanced

1250
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:44,490
civilization 10,000
years ago and today it's,

1251
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,860
you know,
it's more advanced than it was then,

1252
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:52,050
but they still have like a really like
suppressive ancient style culture.

1253
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:56,010
And it's like you really kind of weird
to see this combination of like modern

1254
01:10:56,011 --> 01:10:56,761
technology,

1255
01:10:56,761 --> 01:11:01,170
extreme a wealth in places like Dubai
and the United Arab Emirates and extreme

1256
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:04,780
wealth, but also this
like weird, you know,

1257
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:07,650
with the modern stuff and
this weird ancient stuff.

1258
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,480
Know like the whole thing about, you
know, um, the, just the laws of Islam,

1259
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:16,710
the women wearing and all of that, that,
that crazy. I mean, when did that start?

1260
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,200
Well,
it's a theocracy.

1261
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:21,350
You have to understand that even in the
Gulf countries that are more progressive,

1262
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:25,520
like, um, you know, the United Arab
Emirates, where'd you buy is like,

1263
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,490
there's places you can
drink a beer for ex pats,

1264
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:31,130
not the Muslims because they
don't drink. Yeah. But I mean,

1265
01:11:31,131 --> 01:11:35,090
you'll be in a Mcdonald's and you'll
hear a call to prayer and the expectation

1266
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:38,150
is that you got to put down your mcrae.
Really? I'm dropping. Rolling. Yeah.

1267
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:41,810
Like you gotta get down. Who Calls
to prayer? Um, no, at the mosques,

1268
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:44,720
like you hear a five times a day.
Like the first time I heard it,

1269
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:48,350
I didn't even know what that sound was. It
sounds, it's like terrifying. It's like,

1270
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,200
ah, and you're like, what
the fuck is happening?

1271
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,630
So you could think of,
it's like the end of [inaudible].

1272
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,240
Yeah, you don't. And as it, you're like,

1273
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:57,870
it sounds like you just want to cover
your ears and just cry. And that's their,

1274
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,980
that's their call to prayer. So you just
don't know what the fuck's happened.

1275
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,050
Do you, you know, the,

1276
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,420
a lot of people saying that
there's something to having
some sort of an extreme

1277
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,100
discipline along those lines,

1278
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,540
that it does keep you billing line and
facilitates family and it facilitates,

1279
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,000
it's possible.
It doesn't always,

1280
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:17,010
obviously if they're fucking
little kids in the ass.

1281
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,070
Yeah. I don't know. Right now
people are that everybody across the

1282
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:25,330
board. But the idea that, uh, you
know, some intense form of study, like,

1283
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:29,830
like Islam or like Buddhism
or Christianity or like
anything where you're really

1284
01:12:29,831 --> 01:12:31,540
getting involved in the,
you know,

1285
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:35,510
the practice of some intense
discipline and some intense study of,

1286
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:38,280
especially if you have strict
enforcement. Yeah. That's that,

1287
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:41,530
that's the key right there, man.
When you have like a, you know,

1288
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:44,860
in Iran where they have the
religious police and in addition to,

1289
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:51,190
or if you go to Saudi Arabia, they have
that they have like religious police.

1290
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:51,461
Yeah.

1291
01:12:51,461 --> 01:12:56,461
We had somebody who was the old Soviet
Union was going to get arrested.

1292
01:12:56,990 --> 01:13:01,790
Oh, I almost, and Ramadan, I was there
during their, their holy month of Ramadan.

1293
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:05,450
I was in the back of a van
drinking a bottle of water
and the marine I was worth,

1294
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:08,600
it was like, what the fuck and
model out we're on the freeway.

1295
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:12,530
If someone sees you on the freeway
drinking water when the sun is still up

1296
01:13:12,531 --> 01:13:15,560
during Ramadan, the religious, they
can report you to the religious police.

1297
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:17,330
And as a Westerner,
they'll throw you in jail.

1298
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,490
And that's in the hip city of Dubai.

1299
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:21,343
Oh yes,

1300
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:26,540
and you get sent to jail for like two
months and it's like a $3,000 penalty and

1301
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,130
they all feed you.
They don't feed you,

1302
01:13:28,131 --> 01:13:31,520
so your relatives have to come and
feed you if you have the misfortune of

1303
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:34,310
getting put into jail in the Middle East.

1304
01:13:34,311 --> 01:13:38,140
So I don't know why they don't eat and
I don't know why they're plugging Dubai.

1305
01:13:38,141 --> 01:13:41,930
Is this like wild west? This like
Vegas of the Middle East? It's,

1306
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:44,270
it's still Muslim.
You guys like it's not it.

1307
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:49,220
It enraged me to see sex in the city,
to taking place in like Abu Dhabi.

1308
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:52,490
Like are you kidding me?
Like this is not a place for you

1309
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:55,830
slut. Yeah. Dot.

1310
01:13:55,930 --> 01:14:00,930
Don't old sled and really confused
thinking that sluttiness was acceptable

1311
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:08,230
and not sad. Oh, that woman's not
sad. She's all fucking panther.

1312
01:14:08,231 --> 01:14:11,800
She's out there having a good
time. She's hot. You go girl.

1313
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,850
And all these women with broken vaginas
lined up to see this fucking crap.

1314
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,320
You get them off the sloppy Ted's just
like Clint Eastwood had people thinking

1315
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:24,790
they can keep an orangutan as a pet.
Right? You can't fucking do that, man.

1316
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,550
I think I'll rip your arms off.
Stuffed them up your nose.

1317
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:32,160
Did you hear about that guy with the
hippo? You didn't hear about this guy.

1318
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,070
I saw something.

1319
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:37,630
It was a guy's famous on the Internet
for having a pet hippo that he rides.

1320
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,750
It actually rides this hippo.
He found it when it was a cub raised it,

1321
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:44,090
it's whole light waves that well,
it finally fucking chilled them.

1322
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,310
This poor fucking silly cunt

1323
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,150
was killed by the animal.
Shocker.

1324
01:14:53,151 --> 01:14:55,720
That kills more people
in Africa than any animal

1325
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:02,200
to be fucking oh yeah, dude.
Yeah. Tigers are actually in Asia,

1326
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:06,350
but um, they, they, they bite people
in fucking half, man. They're,

1327
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:08,080
they're actually like a tight,
well,

1328
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,120
I think there's somehow or
another like cousins to a pig. Uh,

1329
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,860
they used to think they were like really
closely related, but another thing,

1330
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,730
there's some just shoot and they're like,
but whatever it is,

1331
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:17,400
they're all this fuck.
Well,

1332
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:22,410
they are as a giant fucking animal that
is super aggressive and really mean and

1333
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,200
just bit the fuck out of this guy.

1334
01:15:26,201 --> 01:15:29,660
And they found this corpse
mauled in the water. Well,

1335
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,720
he thought it was cute that
he used to ride this thing.

1336
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:37,300
You can't grow up with an animal from
like from an early age that and it would

1337
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,880
not fall in love with you
that it would still do this.

1338
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:44,050
It's got a weird still in some ways I
think people get aggressive with people

1339
01:15:44,051 --> 01:15:45,160
and they hit people,
you know,

1340
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:48,160
like brothers and sisters hit each other
and they don't have enough strength to

1341
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:51,580
hurt each other, you know? But if
your brother was a fucking gorilla,

1342
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:55,060
an 800 pound gorilla and you were a two
month old baby and your brother got mad

1343
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:57,580
at you and just fucking club do you
in the head and he would kill you.

1344
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:00,250
The problem is, you know when, when
babies get managed or they're, well,

1345
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:03,220
they're both babies and they really
don't have much impact to their slaps.

1346
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,370
This is a completely different thing.
That's Hipaa.

1347
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:09,550
This hippo got mad like for a moment, this
guy's probably an annoying douche bag.

1348
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:12,310
Why is he riding his hipbone the
first place, right? They're fed him.

1349
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:15,070
This guy's fucking crazy.
He's a crazy person.

1350
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,420
This is not what you're supposed to do.

1351
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,350
What's everybody knows that you're not
supposed to fucking even make contact

1352
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,010
with these. There's this guy
bald, by the way, he's a big guy.

1353
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,310
What city was it was a marble.
I think there's a South Africa.

1354
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:32,770
Um, yeah. Why do people need exotic
pets? Why? Why must you see that?

1355
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:36,010
You saw that you guys saw the
guy in Ohio, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1356
01:16:36,011 --> 01:16:39,160
The crazy guy who had all those
animals who killed himself.

1357
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,860
Let all the animals free kill themselves.

1358
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:47,080
At least that guy had them in
cages, you know, and that guy,

1359
01:16:47,081 --> 01:16:49,630
they knew it was a fucking,
uh, who is a loose cannon.

1360
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:53,230
They said that he had threatened to do
that before they had an issue with the

1361
01:16:53,231 --> 01:16:55,000
cops.
It's like all like these fucking animals.

1362
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,790
It's crazy asshole.

1363
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,520
When I was going to say that was the
district of upon us might not even want it

1364
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:06,640
to kill him.
He might have gotten mad at him.

1365
01:17:06,641 --> 01:17:10,250
Like he would bite another hippopotamus,
like, get off me bitch. Stop writing me.

1366
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:14,420
I want to fucking rest. But when you do
that too, a little flimsy ass person,

1367
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:15,680
they break and they die.

1368
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:19,940
There's a video that Brian turned me
onto of lions trying to kill a hippo and

1369
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:22,040
it's the craziest thing ever.
They can't kill it.

1370
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,610
The jump on his thing bite then
it's kind of fucked up in the hip.

1371
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:26,480
I was just like getting
mad, like, get off me bitch.

1372
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:29,240
But they keep buying them and keep them.
They can't kill it.

1373
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:34,250
He's like armored and what they're doing
is biting through his spine slowly.

1374
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:35,180
That's how they're killing them.

1375
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:39,470
They're choosing to pick a spot on a
spine and they're pulling chunks of it out

1376
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:41,450
and he's like barely
noticing that they're there.

1377
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:46,790
That's not an animal you want to fuck
where no fuck worth. As human beings,

1378
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:48,950
we're actually quite
vulnerable in the wild,

1379
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:50,980
like the our only
protection is our brains.

1380
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,140
We don't have an exoskeleton or I
always say, think about a fucking house,

1381
01:17:57,141 --> 01:18:00,740
cat house Canada. If a house cat
wants to kill you, could you imagine?

1382
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,440
Could you imagine what that's like?

1383
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:06,280
Have you ever been around a feral
cat wildcat there? Scariest fucking,

1384
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:08,930
they're scary.
They're really terrifying.

1385
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,350
I've been over around feral cats that
I thought were going to attack me.

1386
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,040
And it is a dangerous moment like where
you like this thing can do some fucking

1387
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,860
damage. It can jump all the
way up to your face easily.

1388
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,790
A cat can easily jump right up to
your face and bite your fucking face.

1389
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,880
You imagine a wild cat claws.
Dig It into your head.

1390
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,730
Won't let go biting your face
and kicking with his back leg.

1391
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,820
That's absolutely frightening.
And they're tiny. They're tiny.

1392
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:33,590
You saw my little cat let us pass.

1393
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:36,020
And what does she wish she said
were like three pounds or something.

1394
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,980
But if she wanted to fuck me up,
that'd be terrifying. In Ball. Scary.

1395
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,820
I lived in Boston for a
summer one time and uh, my,

1396
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:46,870
I was staying with my friend on
a first floor apartment and they,

1397
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,130
I slept on the couch and the couch was
right next to the first floor windows and

1398
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:54,850
they would open the window and it had
a screen and there was a neighborhood

1399
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,220
Ferrell,
crazy maniac,

1400
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,430
fucking like emotionally unadjusted cat

1401
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:05,850
when I'm chilling, just laying there.
It would jump up onto the screen and go,

1402
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:10,380
like, I wouldn't show
up, I would levitate,

1403
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:15,360
like jump up off the thing and it would
just sit there and scream closet crazy.

1404
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:19,400
Looking at PSI, I would have
fucking near harder about that.

1405
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,700
Toxo plasma,

1406
01:19:20,701 --> 01:19:24,530
that parasite that a lot of
feral cats have in there.

1407
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,240
No, it's a, it's a rat parasite.

1408
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,600
It starts out in rats and it hijacks a
rat sexual reward system and gets these

1409
01:19:33,211 --> 01:19:36,240
rats attracted to the smell of cat piss.

1410
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:40,950
So like the rats go around the cats,
the cats eat the rats, the cats get it.

1411
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:44,040
And then the cats give it to
people usually from feces,

1412
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:48,390
from stepping in their shit or dropping
your food in there and you pick it up.

1413
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,080
Yeah. And it affects
human, uh, the human brain.

1414
01:19:52,081 --> 01:19:55,860
It affects the way people behave
and makes men more impulsive.

1415
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,790
It's a responsible for a disproportionate
number of motorcycle accidents.

1416
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:03,720
They checked people that are crashing
motorcycles and they find out that a lot

1417
01:20:03,721 --> 01:20:05,820
of them are infected with
this toxoplasma shit.

1418
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,130
And in Europe it's like
really prevalent anywhere.

1419
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,910
There's a lot of wild cats. It's really
prevalent like a Europe and France,

1420
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:16,410
80% of the people are in fact, it
would toxoplasma, yes, 80 in America,

1421
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:18,570
it's over 60 million.
It's really crazy.

1422
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,110
But that cat might've had that and
it might've been just, I'm not,

1423
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:24,180
I can't even describe to
how terrifying it was.

1424
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,730
I don't think they hear a
mapped out the behavior,

1425
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,410
the behavioral change that had,

1426
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,920
hasn't cats because I've only heard
about the behavioral change in humans and

1427
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:34,980
rats. So just really interesting
that I, I've never heard anything.

1428
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,910
There's a guy named Robert Sapolsky,
this the,

1429
01:20:36,911 --> 01:20:41,130
a the leading scientist on all this shit
and he's got some amazing videos on it

1430
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,020
and you know, he goes into
depth about how, uh, they,

1431
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:47,510
they really are just sort of wrapping
their head around this, the, uh,

1432
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,440
the extent of the infiltration of this
parasite into the, into human beings.

1433
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,820
I mean, it's like, it might be like half
the population of the earth are fact.

1434
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:01,350
It's really crazy. Yeah. I mean, because
in Brazil it's 60% and France, it's 80%.

1435
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:05,220
It's, it's like it's really high and a
lot of different places in South America.

1436
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:08,760
It's, it's like I said, over 60
million. That's the, the estimate.

1437
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:11,700
People don't even know, you know,
mean we always talk about it. Like we,

1438
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,520
you know what if I had it,
I was around a cat when I was young.

1439
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,880
I had a feral cat that I raised, you
know, and uh, Brian's been around cats,

1440
01:21:18,881 --> 01:21:22,100
Kansas whole live. Joey Diaz has like
11 cats. What would you tell him?

1441
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,300
He has 11 cats and a
lot of them were wild.

1442
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:27,120
He's to take wild cats in and
feed wild cats outside. Wait,

1443
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:30,750
what could that do to you though? We don't
know. Fucks with your brain, man. Yeah.

1444
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:31,081
You know,

1445
01:21:31,081 --> 01:21:34,470
your immune system is supposed to keep
most of it in check and if you have a

1446
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:38,000
healthy immune system, but they, they
don't know really. They don't, I mean,

1447
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:39,730
it affects people in different ways.

1448
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,470
Could you imagine everybody's just
racing that, hang around with cats.

1449
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:47,910
That's just gave me a huge, huge
ruthless dick. Imagine if like,

1450
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:49,720
it wasn't Viagara that you needed,
it was just,

1451
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:54,360
you gotta be around a lot of cat shit.
Joey's got a Bagel.

1452
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,820
This is, this is what happens,
bro. Here's, here's the good news.

1453
01:21:56,821 --> 01:22:00,000
Here's the bad news. The good news
is meant to Dick bigger and stronger.

1454
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,230
Okay.
What's the bad news?

1455
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:05,510
The bad news is you become a crazy person.
Yes.

1456
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,470
Eating itself. Your brain is like,
in fact, when the cat parasite,

1457
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,410
I heard a lot of people say
this cat person I saw that about

1458
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:17,480
if the positive was a dick got
bigger and was hard at will.

1459
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:21,210
If your Dick was like a Rhino Horn,
they can always call upon the, uh,

1460
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:25,190
that hippo story made me reminded
me of that asshole with the bears,

1461
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:30,880
grizzly man,
crazy theater.

1462
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:33,950
And we laughed so hard.
That kind of cemented our relationship.

1463
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,730
There was a moment and we watched,

1464
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:40,760
we watched that documentary in
the theater and there's probably,

1465
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:45,020
there's 40 or 50 people there and we kept,
we were the assholes.

1466
01:22:45,021 --> 01:22:47,960
They were likely to have fucking
done like the whole time.

1467
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,240
And then there was a scene,
well,

1468
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:54,590
I'll never forget where they interviewed
a pilot that would fly Timothy out

1469
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:55,424
there and uh,

1470
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:59,810
and the place is quiet and we're
sitting there watching and then they go,

1471
01:22:59,811 --> 01:23:02,210
what did you think when you
like would drop them off?

1472
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:05,320
And he told you he was going to be with
bears for months and the guy goes, well,

1473
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:07,180
honestly I thought he was retarded

1474
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:13,440
and we laughed so loud
and everybody in the theater

1475
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:18,150
and when we look at where did you guys
see it? We saw it in some dilemma.

1476
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:22,890
I saw that in Hollywood and
the whole theater was laughing.

1477
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:27,030
I saw it in a gray zone. Everybody
thought it was funny. Yeah.

1478
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:28,170
I think you started with Eddie.

1479
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:32,920
We were blazed. Of course. Every
moment of the movie was Hilarious,

1480
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,990
man.
We were laughing.

1481
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:37,230
It was like a God damn comedy
when he was playing with the shit

1482
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,580
out. He's like, no dude,

1483
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,390
it's stuck up there.
Shit. We were laughing

1484
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:50,690
so hard and that's, that place
felt like it was a dean of stuffy.

1485
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:55,380
I think Lemley crowd generally I
need to move to Pasadena. Yeah.

1486
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,970
Because the ice house get myself
a mansion up there. Shit. Yeah.

1487
01:23:58,971 --> 01:24:00,490
Dean is where it's at.
I liked it.

1488
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:03,990
It's what the San Fernando Valley intended
to be. I grew up in the valley. Yeah,

1489
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:07,190
but they wanted it to be like Pasadena.
Pasadena is better.

1490
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:11,270
Some hearts are got in the valley, but
summer, whenever we do the ice house,

1491
01:24:11,271 --> 01:24:13,640
they were like, people are fucking
really genuinely nice out here.

1492
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,320
It doesn't feel like La.

1493
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,130
It feels like a different type of
homeless people are all old ladies too.

1494
01:24:19,131 --> 01:24:22,220
There was no like homeless guys are old
ladies and they make these like tent,

1495
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:22,940
like these,

1496
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:27,500
these forts and they're so nicely folded
like blankets and cans are folded.

1497
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:28,640
Even sad shit dude.

1498
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:32,930
It's really makes me feel really bad
when I see some woman and you know,

1499
01:24:32,931 --> 01:24:36,370
I see her out there on her own. I don't
know why it kills me. I don't like those.

1500
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,870
It makes me, I feel like some
old guy like to carry, so still

1501
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:45,130
I see an older, I see an old, a woman

1502
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:47,770
and I feel terrible.
I don't you hate seeing old,

1503
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:52,570
like I'm talking to older people doing
like, like having like judge your garbage.

1504
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:57,610
Like can you see like, uh, like a seven,
uh, clearly somebody in their seventies,

1505
01:24:57,611 --> 01:25:00,970
like just having any job really. I feel
like sometimes they like that though.

1506
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:04,960
Like my mom retired and then went back
to work at a fucking Amish restaurant

1507
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:08,230
gift shop just because she was bored
out of her mind. That's different.

1508
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:11,650
He's like getting excited an hour.
You can see it on someone's face.

1509
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:15,900
You can see when they're like, ah, I gotta
do this to get the, you know. Yeah, yeah,

1510
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:17,620
yeah. That sucks. Well, you know,

1511
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:21,510
it sucks because you also imagine
yourself doing that. Of course,

1512
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,430
when you're tired and old and yeah,

1513
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,470
you really should be resting and
enjoying your last days on this planet,

1514
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:28,900
but for your fucking
transitioned into the afterlife.

1515
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,740
But now you've got to fucking
hat on. You're working at
Chuckie cheese, you know,

1516
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:35,440
hey kids, what do you want? You
want a special and you want pizza?

1517
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:38,440
Do you want to try it? That's why
they be done daily. Double Dose.

1518
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:44,620
This, my parents generation cause they
really got fucked in this recession.

1519
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:47,620
A lot of people that are planning
on retiring can't do that now.

1520
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:50,480
You worked their whole God
damn life and now what? Yeah,

1521
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:54,280
there's a guy who lives down the street
from me that was trying to build a house.

1522
01:25:54,281 --> 01:25:56,410
He had this whole speech,
he had a plot,

1523
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:59,920
picked out a really nice spot with a
beautiful view and everything and he was

1524
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:05,250
putting all his money towards this and
fucking stock market crashed and all the,

1525
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:10,100
all the bullshit went down the economy,
shit, the bed, he, he lost his,

1526
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:13,610
he lost his savings. He lost
everything. He lost the whole pile.

1527
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:19,640
Just has this lot is beautiful lot that
represents is his dreams that will never

1528
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:22,440
take place and he's an older guy man.
He's so,

1529
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:23,870
he's not going to be
around that much longer.

1530
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:29,220
That really tells me there are people
that retired at exactly the right moment.

1531
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:30,501
You know what I mean?

1532
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:33,770
Like there are people who got their
money out when it was at a peak and then

1533
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:35,610
there was people who like
were like literally the,

1534
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:40,180
it's like a like a cliche
like buddy cop movie.

1535
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:45,190
Like I'm retiring next year and you're
like that guy just from sticking around

1536
01:26:46,261 --> 01:26:47,780
like till may or whatever.

1537
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:52,781
It was like lost his net worth 50 60
completely changed his fucking life.

1538
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:57,740
Yeah, that crazy low. A lot of people
planned on, everything's staying the same.

1539
01:26:57,741 --> 01:27:02,420
They're like, we just got it. We're
just about to escape here and boom,

1540
01:27:02,421 --> 01:27:06,170
the floor falls out and not
only are you out of a job,

1541
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:09,230
not only do you no longer have
a pension, but oh, guess what?

1542
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:12,530
You can afford your house anymore.
Oh, well you were almost homeless. Oh,

1543
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:15,230
look at this. Now you're sleeping at
your friend's house. Like Holy Shit.

1544
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:17,710
You have your kids and your wife and your,

1545
01:27:17,711 --> 01:27:20,780
you're staying at someone else's house
and you were in their basement all huddle

1546
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:25,280
up together and you're like, holy
fuck, I can't find a job. Boom.

1547
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,760
That's what's happening to a
lot of people map. There's a,

1548
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:31,420
there's a lot of people out there
that it just stopped, like the, the,

1549
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,030
the machine stopped and everybody was
like, what's going on? Where are the jobs?

1550
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:39,960
There are no jobs. There's no jobs in
Ohio. I mean there's a few clubs in Ohio,

1551
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,940
like Toledo and Cleveland.
Yeah.

1552
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:47,270
It's so sad because there's
nothing for people to do Detroit.

1553
01:27:47,271 --> 01:27:49,680
You got to see it like, oh no
one talks about it. But like,

1554
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:54,110
I did Detroit twice this year and like,
uh, you know, there's, there's, uh,

1555
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:56,300
the club isn't actually improper
Detroit, but you, you know,

1556
01:27:56,301 --> 01:28:00,740
you fly in then harbor that club. No,
I did. Um, I did the comedy castle,

1557
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:04,880
which is a suburb of it or something.
But you drive through and like the,

1558
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,610
you know, the fucked up
part is, um, it's actually,

1559
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:12,611
I think seeing the industry places that
have closed that used to be this factory

1560
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:15,820
and then all the windows are
broken out. You're like, Holy Shit,

1561
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:19,250
that's a place that like 2000 people or
whatever you used to work at and it's

1562
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:23,720
just gone. You ever seen those
videos where they drive down hole?

1563
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:28,640
Huge. Just mile after mile of abandoned
houses. Yeah, it's like craziness.

1564
01:28:28,641 --> 01:28:32,720
And so it really does look like some
Mad Max Shit, you know? It looks like,

1565
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:36,800
like what? What comes next? You know,
what is this like? This is a large scale.

1566
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:41,720
It's Goddamn Detroit, Detroit rock city.
It's where mustangs come from. It's,

1567
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:45,110
we're Corvettes come from sort of
the Bowling Green Kentucky now.

1568
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:48,260
But you know what I'm saying? It's
like that's where, you know, cars,

1569
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:53,110
American cars were built,
really moved to Canada.

1570
01:28:53,111 --> 01:28:55,940
That was his first job at
Chrysler factory. It's,

1571
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:58,670
I don't know if is there anymore?
I don't know. Probably in Mongolia.

1572
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:02,190
I just heard this guy on NPR,
he wrote a book about

1573
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,270
how this generation of kids, you know,
your Momma always told you, be a doctor,

1574
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:09,210
be a lawyer, being accounting.
Because those jobs you'll all,

1575
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:12,570
you always have a job. Well not
now because you can outsource that.

1576
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,050
You want your taxes done cheap, you can
send them to a guy in India that can,

1577
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:19,500
that knows tax law. Same with
everything else. So this generation,

1578
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:22,560
they're going to have to get creative
in terms of like how they think,

1579
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:26,430
create their own jobs,
create their own way of making money.

1580
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:30,540
Like those those days are slowly
dwindling down those, those trade. Yeah.

1581
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:33,940
Yeah. We'll also, when you have the
Internet and you're sending files,

1582
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:36,700
it doesn't matter if you send a file to
the account accountant up the street or

1583
01:29:36,701 --> 01:29:39,440
if you send the file to a guy on the
other side of the world. Oh yeah.

1584
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,710
If he's willing to do it cheaper.
Yeah.

1585
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:45,820
It's if our fucking very
strange time and mechanics good.

1586
01:29:45,821 --> 01:29:49,990
The real problem is right now we
are slowly being forced to live.

1587
01:29:49,991 --> 01:29:53,290
The reality to the rest of the world has
been operating under for the past few

1588
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:56,800
decades. That's really what's
going on, you know? And
everybody was like, you know,

1589
01:29:56,801 --> 01:29:59,310
America is not a third world
country, you know? Yeah.

1590
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:02,440
Well when everything becomes
the same, guess what? Yeah.

1591
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:06,010
A lot of it is going to be like a
third world country because as we more

1592
01:30:06,011 --> 01:30:08,500
interconnect with the rest of the world,
you know,

1593
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:13,501
and as our facade of an economy
slowly evaporates into nothing.

1594
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:14,201
This,
yeah,

1595
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:18,730
we were really are forced into a situation
that looks eerily similar to what

1596
01:30:18,731 --> 01:30:22,110
Russia faced. It was really, yeah. It
looks like you're really getting better,

1597
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:25,560
uh, at, at many things in different,
you know, fields. Yeah. I didn't,

1598
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:27,010
I saw a thing about um,

1599
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:31,390
highways and freeways and
how like for a long time,

1600
01:30:31,391 --> 01:30:33,930
like we set the standard for light.

1601
01:30:33,931 --> 01:30:37,020
Like we were the first like massive
country to build like where you can you

1602
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:38,140
think about it.
We don't,

1603
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:39,730
we take it for granted that you
can get in a car and be like,

1604
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:43,410
I want to drive to Montana. You
just, any, any other city you want,

1605
01:30:43,411 --> 01:30:45,790
you want to go to Louisiana, you just
take this way. You know, it just,

1606
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:51,220
it's like that and we've had like the
best and like China is killing us in

1607
01:30:51,221 --> 01:30:54,370
highways and freeways
in quality in like uh,

1608
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:57,820
the number of them and then where
you can go in them killing us.

1609
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,770
Ordained says they kill us. The
cell phone coverage. He's like,

1610
01:31:00,771 --> 01:31:02,250
you're going over there.
Oh yeah.

1611
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:04,780
He said he can be over there and like the
middle of nowhere in the woods and you

1612
01:31:04,781 --> 01:31:07,330
got five bars. Goddamn. Yeah.

1613
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:11,640
Well I haven't been to China,
but I've been to South Korea and dude,

1614
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,070
their society is way more advanced.
They feel like

1615
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,180
their internet is way more advanced. Every
new phones are more advanced, cleaner.

1616
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:21,000
They're just have, I don't
know, they're way ahead of us.

1617
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:23,830
They're crushing it by a lot of shit
with their phones, but they're just,

1618
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:26,130
that's just starting to
come to the phones now.

1619
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:27,690
There's a thing called Google Wallet.

1620
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,220
Google wallet is an APP that
allows you to go up to a,

1621
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:33,990
when you go to the thing where
you scan your credit card,

1622
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:36,900
you could look at it and if it
has like sort of this logo on it,

1623
01:31:36,901 --> 01:31:41,420
this Google wallet, sort of a logo. Then
what you do is you take the application,

1624
01:31:41,421 --> 01:31:42,780
you pull it up on your Google phones,

1625
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:47,860
press it said put it right up to that
and it automatically pays for your,

1626
01:31:47,890 --> 01:31:50,850
your bill. So you don't even
have to swipe a credit card.

1627
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:54,390
You don't have to sign shit. He
just put in your code, put it,

1628
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,810
press your phone right up to it, Bang.
So you don't have to have a phone.

1629
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,970
I mean you don't have to have a wallet
with credit cards anymore. Eventually.

1630
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,550
Yeah. Eventually everything you'll
be able to buy with your phone.

1631
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,050
I don't know if Google Wallet exists.

1632
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:09,550
Do you know Brian with a
Google wallet exist for the
Iphone? I don't think so. No.

1633
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:12,800
I think it just takes you to, I think
you'd do it over a website though. Oh,

1634
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:16,790
over website. I don't know. No, that's
whack. You want to do it. That's one.

1635
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:20,380
One knock the Google phones have over
the iPhone if they have that because

1636
01:32:20,381 --> 01:32:22,240
that's pretty dope.
Once it comes into focus,

1637
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:26,200
once it becomes a really popular thing
that might make people shy away from the

1638
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,090
iPhone to the droid phones

1639
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,280
getting the new studio.

1640
01:32:29,281 --> 01:32:32,610
One thing I thought was really
interesting was that like home speeds for

1641
01:32:32,611 --> 01:32:36,180
internet or capped at around
what's the highest lately?

1642
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:39,480
Like 60 or is it even at 30
megabytes? I only get, I don't,

1643
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,540
I only get like 25 of 25 but uh,

1644
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,950
what I have to get a business account
because it's a business space that I rent.

1645
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:51,120
The internet speeds are like up to like
hundreds of gigabytes or even more.

1646
01:32:51,121 --> 01:32:54,120
Maybe like the upload
speeds are ridiculous too.

1647
01:32:54,121 --> 01:32:57,270
I think there were like five
megabyte uploads and stiff what?

1648
01:32:57,271 --> 01:33:01,380
I think I'm paying for two megabyte for
the fastest for a universe and it's like

1649
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:02,430
that's not even fair.

1650
01:33:02,431 --> 01:33:07,431
It's like I almost like if I am at home
and I went to play games or ba be able

1651
01:33:07,501 --> 01:33:08,970
to pay for something like this.

1652
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:12,900
I wish I would have to make my house
a business almost or something.

1653
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,900
I think you could probably do that if
you can make your house a business. No,

1654
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:19,290
I mean just like listed as a business.

1655
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,620
You would have to like
not live there though.

1656
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:26,160
I mean I don't think it works out what
you can, I don't know if it's the same.

1657
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:29,580
Like if you have a Home Office, I
think that's still a home. Right.

1658
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,330
I don't know though.

1659
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:33,090
I mean you're building might've
been wired differently too though.

1660
01:33:33,091 --> 01:33:35,310
You have to take that into account.
It's a building,

1661
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:36,870
you know that's a commercial building.

1662
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:40,260
I mean when they wired it they might've
Wa I don't know what the story is.

1663
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:43,860
What is keeping you from getting
the highest internet? You know

1664
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:46,150
that's weird though. It's, it's,
it's, it's weird that like,

1665
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:49,310
cause I live very close to it,
you know, and I've, I checked it.

1666
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,940
I wonder if it's something like
they can't offer it to that,

1667
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,850
that many people like the bandwidth
isn't there. Yeah, that's a good point.

1668
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,050
I mean that could be,
yeah,

1669
01:33:57,051 --> 01:34:00,340
because people will be just downloaded
a million movies all day. It,

1670
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:05,090
has anybody ever gone to jail
for stealing movies? Yeah.

1671
01:34:05,091 --> 01:34:07,550
What's that one movie?
The one the boring ass.

1672
01:34:07,551 --> 01:34:09,500
Maybe we were there like picking up bombs,

1673
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:13,050
whatever that movie was at won all those
awards where it's like there's that

1674
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,270
hurt locker,
the hurt locker there.

1675
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:18,920
Those guys like I guess when
after like tons of people,

1676
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:24,140
like 25,000 people or something ridiculous
like that and they just dropped a lot

1677
01:34:24,141 --> 01:34:25,340
of them the other day,

1678
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,490
so they're still getting suing
people that downloaded their movie.

1679
01:34:28,491 --> 01:34:29,340
I'll leave that.

1680
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,780
It's weird at the production company
actually is the one going after them.

1681
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:34,400
So the production company,

1682
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,990
they somehow or another find out who
is put these things on long and for

1683
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:40,510
download and then they, they
attract, they attack them.

1684
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:44,000
Yeah. They pretty much tell
like, you know, certain cases.

1685
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:47,450
Could they tell by who uploaded
it? Is that what it is? I guess,

1686
01:34:47,451 --> 01:34:49,790
you know what they do
is they can check the,

1687
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,820
the ips get from the
torrents and stuff like that.

1688
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,300
And then they would have to sue
like know charter or whoever.

1689
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,120
They made an out of some
kid a couple of years ago,

1690
01:34:59,121 --> 01:35:01,300
wasn't it like a kid and his
mom and they were like me,

1691
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,230
even though everybody
had downloaded songs,

1692
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,810
they went after some
kid and they were like,

1693
01:35:05,811 --> 01:35:10,370
you owe like $380,000 because this amount
per song. Yeah. But then they, you know,

1694
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,470
I think they settled with
the medical work, but it was,

1695
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,670
they were doing that clearly just to get
publicity for the case and make it seem

1696
01:35:16,671 --> 01:35:19,100
like, you know, don't you
dare dream of doing this.

1697
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:22,480
It is kind of weird, man.
It's such a weird gray area.

1698
01:35:22,481 --> 01:35:26,140
Whether or not something that you bought
and you paid for, whether you could

1699
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:30,640
distributed for music. It's really
interesting like how these paid,

1700
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:35,170
uh, the companies like Spotify and
rhapsody and stuff like that really in my

1701
01:35:35,171 --> 01:35:36,370
opinion,
have stepped in.

1702
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:40,750
And I don't really download music much
anymore because now I just pay 10 bucks a

1703
01:35:40,751 --> 01:35:43,990
month for Spotify and I fucking listen
to it as much as I want to. You know,

1704
01:35:43,991 --> 01:35:45,820
it's like a jukebox of everything.
Yeah.

1705
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,450
Does don't you have to
be online to get that?

1706
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:51,640
Uh, not all the time. I think you
can save songs to your device.

1707
01:35:51,641 --> 01:35:54,330
I haven't really fucked around with
it too much on that part, but uh,

1708
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,820
I think you could also save songs.
Like I said, if you pay $10 a day,

1709
01:35:57,821 --> 01:36:00,260
it will download it inside
the app and then it will off.

1710
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:04,360
It needs to at least connect to make sure
that you're a member still and then it

1711
01:36:04,361 --> 01:36:05,340
makes the,
all the songs were,

1712
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:08,830
that's annoying. That's too complicated.
I'd rather get things on iTunes.

1713
01:36:08,831 --> 01:36:10,650
I get my shit on it.
How do you feel about

1714
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:12,690
like your content though?

1715
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,210
You know what,
man,

1716
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:19,040
I think you know what I do
is very different because
first of all, as a comedian,

1717
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:20,750
when you're,
you know,

1718
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:23,660
when you're releasing your information
or when you're releasing your material,

1719
01:36:23,661 --> 01:36:26,000
rather if you like putting on
a CD or a DVD or something,

1720
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:30,260
you're essentially putting
out an advertisement and
you're essentially putting

1721
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:34,550
out a, uh, uh, an example of
your work that you're proud of,

1722
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:37,490
that you want people to see
and enjoy, you know? And Yeah,

1723
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:40,100
you want to be compensated for it.
Yeah. You want to make money for it.

1724
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:44,620
But the way I roll is it,
if I download,

1725
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:48,560
if I've ever downloaded
anything illegally, I've
always bought it if I liked it.

1726
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:50,930
Always really was. Yeah.
Well, and even bought,

1727
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:53,270
I've bought some things that I didn't
like just because I felt guilty because I

1728
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:55,880
couldn't,
couldn't get it legally when I wanted to,

1729
01:36:55,881 --> 01:36:58,430
so I had to get it some other way. There's
no way. Most people do that though.

1730
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,020
Yeah.
I have a problem.

1731
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:04,360
I can't litter if I drop something on
the ground is I have to get it. You know?

1732
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:07,350
I'll often after, if the fucking
wind is blowing, goddammit,

1733
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:09,260
off the fucking chase after
this little piece of paper,

1734
01:37:09,261 --> 01:37:12,050
it could be a gum wrapper. Really?
Yeah. I don't like, it's nice.

1735
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:15,800
I don't like leaving behind a
problem. It bugs me, you know?

1736
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:20,090
So when I look at the idea
of littering psychically,

1737
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,980
the idea of littering with your
consciousness that you, you,

1738
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:24,010
you take little thing,

1739
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:27,170
you do shitty little things and you
take them for granted and then you have

1740
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:29,600
these little things curled
up in a fucking corner.

1741
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,370
There's a little crumpled up papers of,

1742
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:35,420
of ideas and consciousness is littered
your fucking head. I don't like it.

1743
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,780
So if I, if a band is
good, if I buy, you know,

1744
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,890
if somebody sends me to a youtube link
and I go, wow, that's fucking badass song.

1745
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:45,290
And then there's a download link
somewhere on some site where you're not

1746
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:48,940
supposed to go to. And I download it and
I like it. I always buy it. That's great.

1747
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:52,610
I think you have to, I think
you're supposed to. I don't
really download anything,

1748
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:52,620
any,

1749
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:56,460
I mean everything I know.
Itunes, I mean, even then,

1750
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:58,380
I mean like say if I
found something illegal,

1751
01:37:58,381 --> 01:38:02,220
I'll search to find it illegally or
buy it on Amazon, you know? Yeah.

1752
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:03,820
You guys touching each other?

1753
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:10,490
It was accidental that I bumped it.
Sorry if you heard about Gene Simmons,

1754
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:13,820
Simmons Kid, uh, what
happened there was news. Uh,

1755
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:17,180
I read this morning one
of the beer. Yeah, sure.

1756
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:21,210
He's a comic book artist and Nicole One,
you want a cold?

1757
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:25,980
Oh Shit. Given another. The WHO?

1758
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:30,810
Who's this? Uh, Gene Simmons is kid. Yeah.

1759
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:34,170
And he does comic books.
He does a Manga,

1760
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:39,730
I think it's called a Japan
Japanese style Nma and thanks man.

1761
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:43,770
Yeah, it's real nice guy. I actually
met him once I at the Improv,

1762
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,280
but there's this, uh, they,

1763
01:38:45,281 --> 01:38:50,281
they outdid him for just completely
tracing a Japanese comic book artists and

1764
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:56,490
like they have these like lineups where
they showed like face on top of phase

1765
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:59,000
where they overlay it
and it's exactly him.

1766
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:05,790
How old is he? 19 or 20
isn't he? He's young.

1767
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:09,300
I don't know if he's 19 or 20,
but I don't know the whole story.

1768
01:39:09,301 --> 01:39:11,400
I don't know if like the comics,
like an old comic,

1769
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:14,490
because I know I used to
draw comics just for fun.

1770
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:16,410
I know that there has been
many times where I'd like,

1771
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,050
I liked like how Spiderman was
posing or something like that.

1772
01:39:19,051 --> 01:39:23,250
So I would like trace his pose.
You know, you learn how to draw.

1773
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,290
So I'm wondering is see an art student
or is he trying to sell these things?

1774
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:30,120
That's where it makes me think he sells
them. I think he's pretty successful.

1775
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:32,850
Kind of hard to get away from that one.
Like a trace the ship.

1776
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:37,500
So the Japanese artists on his
Twitter today, uh, you know,

1777
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:41,220
was confused at first,
but then he said something like,

1778
01:39:41,221 --> 01:39:45,630
I'm more surprised that Gene Simmons says
kid does comics or something like that.

1779
01:39:45,631 --> 01:39:49,200
I can't remember. But he knows about
it. He didn't seem that angry. Wow.

1780
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:51,690
How did it not seem angry
though? I don't know. You know,

1781
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:54,370
very polite Japanese people.
I have no idea.

1782
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:59,460
I always feel about stealing now is that
like, especially with jokes, it's like,

1783
01:39:59,461 --> 01:40:02,810
well I can always write another one.
It sucks to have your shit. Yeah.

1784
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:06,300
I could see it happening more in
comic books just for people that like,

1785
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:09,570
I guess he took a lot though
that the comic was called bleach

1786
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:15,290
a band for a little while. What does
he, yeah, yeah, I remember he on,

1787
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:18,240
I watched the show and
the on the reality show,

1788
01:40:18,241 --> 01:40:22,710
his band was playing somewhere and then
his father like flew a flyer out of a

1789
01:40:22,711 --> 01:40:27,480
plane I was showing it was son's
bands playing somewhere and you know,

1790
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:30,870
making a big deal out of
it. Wow. This is crazy. Wow.

1791
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:35,240
You seeing that? It's the kid
that's on that show. Yeah.
Side by side. Not Analysis

1792
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:39,680
is pretty fucking damning. Yeah. He's old
enough to know what I mean. It is. He,

1793
01:40:39,681 --> 01:40:43,340
he's, yeah, it's this is,
it's not just tracing it.

1794
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:45,850
I mean it's like a
straight up taking almost.

1795
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:49,550
Some of it is not tracing some of it.
This one's not tracing,

1796
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:53,650
but it's very obvious where the
idea came from. Yeah. This is bad.

1797
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:58,960
So sad. Yeah. Hmm. I miss the
Osborne through all your own stuff.

1798
01:40:58,961 --> 01:41:02,860
Everybody. It's weird.
I love that show. Well,

1799
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:04,720
some of them were a bit of a stretch.

1800
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:08,290
This is a few of them here that are a
bit of a stretch because that is a style.

1801
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:12,570
What did you look up? How do you
look it up? I just Google uh,

1802
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:17,560
Gene Simmons kid comic book. Okay. Trace.

1803
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,100
Well it definitely looks like pop up.
What day?

1804
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:24,730
There's no doubt about the idea
that he was influenced, you know,

1805
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:26,050
he's an unquestionably,

1806
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:29,170
he was influenced but there's a bunch
of these pictures that are real stretch.

1807
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,770
Did you see what that guy on your
message board said that he, he uh,

1808
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:35,530
for a living buys Google ads all the time.

1809
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:38,980
And we always joke about like how I
always put bottle at the end of Google

1810
01:41:38,981 --> 01:41:42,520
searches. So he was making it
targeting California for the words,

1811
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:46,480
but hole on the end of any kind of
sentence and it just says something like,

1812
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:47,260
hey ride man.

1813
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:50,740
Stop saying buy it whole or look
searching for [inaudible] as a Google ads.

1814
01:41:51,330 --> 01:41:54,710
Google took it down because they get,
he used the word butthole chance.

1815
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:59,450
Say butthole for Google for ads. You could
sell them missiles. Yeah. This, yeah.

1816
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,240
This is, this is crazy, man. This is weird
to watch. He really did trace this stuff.

1817
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:08,250
Yeah. Yeah, you can. I mean,

1818
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:12,280
they even show an overlay. They show
like, here's the original image.

1819
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:17,530
It says, look, trace to
throw it. That really sucks.

1820
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:18,880
It's fucking sad.

1821
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:22,240
This is something that's something
that's really hard to recover from.

1822
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,653
Well as that

1823
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:29,860
appears like he's just made a career
doing this. Like he's decided to try to,

1824
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:33,890
to make a career doing it this
way. Tracy. All right. Yeah.

1825
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:36,310
It looks like you're gonna have to borrow
some more money from dad for awhile.

1826
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:40,810
Well, I don't know man. You know, you want
to give people the benefit of the doubt.

1827
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:45,900
Who knows? It seems, it seems
pretty shitty though. Sucks.

1828
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:49,760
It sucks the air. Right.
Maybe he was fucking a guy.

1829
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:54,110
Maybe he was just horsing
around. You know, he's

1830
01:42:56,120 --> 01:43:01,060
just doing horseplay while, well, why
would people think you're plagiarizing?

1831
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:05,680
Don't have to ask them. Don't ask
me that. You'd have to ask them.

1832
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,990
How was your horsing around? Have
you heard the new fad, that team,

1833
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:13,210
that's the real problem in high
schools is that teens are using vodka.

1834
01:43:13,211 --> 01:43:18,050
So tampons to get drunk at
a,

1835
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:22,090
no, no, no. This is real.
This news stories about it. Go
ahead. Look up the new store.

1836
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,570
Girls are doing this in high school there.
They're soaking,

1837
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:30,720
they're soaking tampons with vodka and
sticking them in their pussy and they're

1838
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:35,650
inserting a beer bongs and they're
assholes and they're getting drunk.

1839
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:43,390
People are nuts. You gotta
go for it. Nuts. Apparently.

1840
01:43:43,391 --> 01:43:47,600
This is what this Vod Cup tampon thing.
You got gotta do it because you

1841
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:53,660
get the video teen chain using or vodka.

1842
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:57,800
So tampons to get drunk.
Teens using vodka,

1843
01:43:57,801 --> 01:44:00,620
soak tampons to get drunk and
you're listening. Go for it, man.

1844
01:44:00,621 --> 01:44:03,230
Try the whole bundle where you can die.
This is the problem.

1845
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,890
It's the alcohol is going
right into your bloodstream.

1846
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:10,220
It's like shooting ivy blood. You
know, you can take things rectally.

1847
01:44:10,221 --> 01:44:14,840
Like there's this girl, she goes
by the name of a neuro soup on, uh,

1848
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:18,830
on Youtube and she has like a
website called neuro soup I think.

1849
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:22,790
And she's like kind of a famous person
in the psychedelic community because at

1850
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:24,380
one point in time she
was living with this guy.

1851
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:28,280
There was this gigantic LSD dealer, like
the biggest l LSD dealer in the world.

1852
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:29,390
And she was a stripper.

1853
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:33,860
And this is a really interesting thing
on vice.com a video where they interview

1854
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:36,170
her and they talk about the crazy
times that she's been through.

1855
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:40,700
One of the things, one of our videos
online is her taking DMT Ainley.

1856
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:45,530
She takes DMT and sticks it in her
ass and trips for like an hour.

1857
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:50,540
Wow. Yeah. Wow. Indeed. That videos.
Yeah. She put the video out there.

1858
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:54,470
Good old fashion. The old fashion, I
guess she wanted to go for a longer ride.

1859
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:58,460
The old fashioned way, only lasts
for about 15 minutes at the most.

1860
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:02,330
What about LSD? You could put that up
your ass, but you can see my eyes. Well,

1861
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:04,980
Jimi Hendrix, the, the
little legend is the,

1862
01:45:04,981 --> 01:45:08,690
Jimi Hendrix used to put it on his Bandana
and as he was sweating and enter into

1863
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:13,700
the pores [inaudible] I've heard of it
being in socks and the people sweating

1864
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:21,080
into their sis like accidentally.
I don't know if that's true,

1865
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:23,870
but I'm sure it could happen.
Yeah, I'm sure that makes sense.

1866
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:28,100
Branding out a dead show is always
interesting seeing happen with, um,

1867
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:31,900
who is the creator of Lsd doctor,

1868
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:38,160
the one that was like, God dammit, I
can't remember his name and Leery. No, no,

1869
01:45:38,161 --> 01:45:43,070
no. [inaudible] I don't know. I forget
the fucking guys name. God Damn it.

1870
01:45:43,071 --> 01:45:44,900
But anyway, uh, I believe at first

1871
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:53,760
[inaudible] Albert Hoffman,

1872
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:58,490
I would often, and then Albert
Hoffman when he invented it,

1873
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:03,320
I believe it happened by accident.
And if I'm not, if I'm not incorrect,

1874
01:46:03,321 --> 01:46:06,920
I think he got it on
his hands or something.

1875
01:46:06,921 --> 01:46:11,380
I forget how he was initially exposed
to it. I forget the story, but, uh,

1876
01:46:11,381 --> 01:46:15,350
I'm pretty sure it, the first time it was
like he got it on something. I was like,

1877
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:20,020
what the fuck is going on on acid
before? No, I've never done it. I said,

1878
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:20,943
I've only done

1879
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:26,520
Salvia DMT,
Fyedka Tampon.

1880
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:29,270
Some of the craziest experience
I've ever had. US eating pot,

1881
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:33,880
some of the most intense psychedelic
experiences I've ever has eating cod.

1882
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,960
I've told her, I'm sure.
Just share some stories.

1883
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,470
You've heard it all when it comes to

1884
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:47,330
what teenagers are turning
to, to get that quick.

1885
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:51,360
It's, it's pretty scary. Was with Erwin
is here with a straight story. Oh boy.

1886
01:46:51,361 --> 01:46:53,490
Elizabeth, right. One I've got
to tell you. See and Catherine,

1887
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:58,491
two things I never thought would appear
in the same exact tampons and vodka.

1888
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:03,150
Do I have your attention? Good.
Because if you're a parent,

1889
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,000
you really still are tight.

1890
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:09,500
She's went home immediately stuffed
the whole bottle of vodka or asshole.

1891
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:16,700
Any city, Sally, I doing it right
now. Finance will open my asshole

1892
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:21,820
when we heard how kids are getting drunk.
No Way.

1893
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:26,680
So we hit up the experts to find out if
it's an urban legend or if it's legit.

1894
01:47:26,830 --> 01:47:30,370
There's been documented cases of people
going to the hospital with alcohol

1895
01:47:30,371 --> 01:47:32,790
poisoning just from utilizing it that way.
Utilizing.

1896
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:36,040
Thomas spends his days patrolling
the halls of a valley high school.

1897
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:38,890
He's heard firsthand how
kids are getting tipsy.

1898
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:43,460
What we're hearing about is teenagers
utilizing a Tampon. So Kumon Bod kippers,

1899
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:48,220
right.
Teens taking tampons,

1900
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:50,920
soaking them in vodka,
damn.

1901
01:47:50,921 --> 01:47:54,830
Teens and inserting them in.
They're posted there.

1902
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:02,410
She can't even say vagina. She says
there. That's a terrified we are.

1903
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:03,790
Anything sexual in America,

1904
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:07,790
it's unbelievable. Off is
definitely not there. No, no, no.

1905
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:09,400
They'll insert them into their rectum.

1906
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:15,870
Alright. And where she comes out
the same. So I'm, I've found the,

1907
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:19,620
uh, how acid was invented. Yeah, it
was an accident. While it's recent,

1908
01:48:19,621 --> 01:48:23,850
the sizing LSD Hoffman accidentally
absorbed a small amount of it through his

1909
01:48:23,851 --> 01:48:27,810
fingertips and serendipitously
discovered the powerful effects.

1910
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:31,470
He said this is his exact
words affected by a remarkable,

1911
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,720
remarkable restlessness combined
with a slight dizziness at home.

1912
01:48:36,721 --> 01:48:41,340
I laid down and sank into a non
unpleasant intoxicated like condition

1913
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:46,520
characterized by an extremely stimulated
imagination in a dream like state with

1914
01:48:46,891 --> 01:48:50,930
eyes closed, I found the daylight
to be unpleasantly glaring.

1915
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:55,290
I have received an uninterrupted
stream of fantastic pictures,

1916
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:59,550
extraordinary shapes with intense
kaleidoscope play of colors.

1917
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:03,930
After some two hours in this
condition faded away. Wow.

1918
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:08,250
So then he decided to take it on his own.
So this was by accident.

1919
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,430
And then what he did is he took it on his
own and tried to ride home on his bike.

1920
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:16,950
It was a little area
called him bicycle day.

1921
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:21,060
The Guy gave herself 25
[inaudible] 25 milligrams,

1922
01:49:21,061 --> 01:49:26,030
which is 250 micrograms. That's
how fucking actual threats.

1923
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:30,180
Threshold dose is only 20 micrograms.
Threshold dose. That means you feel it.

1924
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:31,830
You feel it at 20 micrograms.

1925
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:34,620
So that's the intoxication
threshold is 20 micro grams.

1926
01:49:34,621 --> 01:49:37,280
He takes two 50 [inaudible].

1927
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:41,780
I've never found it from anybody.
I trust I,

1928
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:44,910
I got some from this guy that was friends
with Andy Dick and he was out of his

1929
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:48,100
fucking mind, this guy, and he's
like really wanted me to come

1930
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,510
home and take it again? Nope. Now it's
going to ask you about going to happen.

1931
01:49:51,511 --> 01:49:53,800
It's getting liquid,
even getting liquid.

1932
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:55,600
You've got to know that you're getting it,
man.

1933
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:57,940
You've got to know that people
are taking it consistently.

1934
01:49:57,941 --> 01:50:01,750
It's really fucking have it tested. This
motherfucker really what it should be.

1935
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:06,550
His fucking legal. And there should be
LSD like institutes where you go and, Hey,

1936
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:10,240
do you want to really know who you
are? Sit down. You know what I mean?

1937
01:50:10,241 --> 01:50:14,980
It's all chemically simple. Are
chemically similar to, uh, to each other.

1938
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:17,560
Have you all like Dmt,
Lsd,

1939
01:50:17,561 --> 01:50:21,880
mushrooms are all really close to
exactly. Dimethyl. Here we go. Sorry,

1940
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:25,450
I don't know. I have Google on your phone.

1941
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:29,500
I did ask that as a kid in
math and he said, here we go.

1942
01:50:29,501 --> 01:50:33,590
Because there's a video of me talking
about at least got going in that,

1943
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:37,880
um, and we've talked about
it on the podcast a hundred
times, right? It's, it's a,

1944
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,200
it's a psychedelic chemical, but it's
one of your own brain. Makes Gotcha. Oh,

1945
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:45,280
I'm sorry. And all the really
powerful ones like Lsd, Lsd,

1946
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:49,420
and DMT and mushrooms, they're all real
similar. They're like chemical cousins,

1947
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:50,283
you know?
So it's,

1948
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:53,890
it's interesting that those are the super
potent ones and they're really close

1949
01:50:53,891 --> 01:50:55,010
to what your own brain may

1950
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:59,110
naturally LSD. I don't know man, because
I've taken that a lot in my brain.

1951
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:03,410
Does not function. Did you ever
take it through your ass hole? No.

1952
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:04,201
I took it out loud.

1953
01:51:04,201 --> 01:51:08,340
Blues I when I was 14 years old and I
was golf and I haven't got a hat on him.

1954
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:11,900
Yeah. I had to retain, I had
retainers and a velvet dress,

1955
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:16,250
shit and Susie and the banshees came on
and I did at the same time and I have

1956
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:20,830
through my retainers across the field
at Irvine Meadows and I had to leave and

1957
01:51:20,831 --> 01:51:25,480
that was the end of that. Did you
ever read about how the a scary CIA,

1958
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:29,260
we'd like you to test it. Yes.
The young people, short videos,

1959
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,980
the town in France where they dose the
whole town and put it in their bread,

1960
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:37,270
killed themselves, but I am the 1950s
and really are they doused a whole town.

1961
01:51:37,271 --> 01:51:40,690
They just experiment. And our town
in France. The Americans, yeah.

1962
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:45,530
Freedom of Information Act. It's all all
available now. There's a lot of cool read

1963
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:50,040
be shit they do. They're really truly
defines what the government is all about.

1964
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:50,581
Yeah.
It was,

1965
01:51:50,581 --> 01:51:53,460
a lot of people think the government
is just us working in a different job.

1966
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:57,150
It's not, it's the people that
have a history of being ruthless,

1967
01:51:57,151 --> 01:51:58,320
a history of being ruthless.

1968
01:51:58,321 --> 01:52:00,210
And that's how you get to that
position in the first place.

1969
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:03,370
But the experiments that they did
on, on people are just fucking, yeah.

1970
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:07,200
Horrendous. No. What was the
utility of LSD initially? It was,

1971
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:10,560
they thought was going to
be a true CEO, Sarah. Oh,

1972
01:52:10,561 --> 01:52:12,840
I thought it was to make sure
they wanted to use it. Yeah. No,

1973
01:52:12,841 --> 01:52:16,110
and that's why they didn't do, they
give them steroids for that. Oh, okay.

1974
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:17,250
Steroids and meth.

1975
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:21,930
Crystal Meth is something that the
Japanese invented that for getting fucking

1976
01:52:21,931 --> 01:52:25,340
planes to crash into boats.
Gotta be all messed up and do that.

1977
01:52:25,341 --> 01:52:27,510
And they all met up really
well. Yeah. Yeah. That's,

1978
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:29,340
that's where crystal meth a dream was.

1979
01:52:29,341 --> 01:52:31,710
It invented and now you can
just drive trucks on it.

1980
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,480
Have you ever been around
people that are on meth?

1981
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:40,580
Uh, in high school, I grew up here around
here actually in your neighborhood.

1982
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:44,900
And that was the drug of my generation
was meth and then rave culture.

1983
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:46,100
So was dropping tons

1984
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,990
of v and taking meth, cocaine,
not so much an LSD that,

1985
01:52:49,991 --> 01:52:53,330
that's my generation.
Once I tried it and I don't,

1986
01:52:53,331 --> 01:52:56,720
I don't like how like just just do coke.

1987
01:52:56,721 --> 01:52:58,400
Coke is so much classier.

1988
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:03,080
You fucking stay up for days making
collages and moving furniture.

1989
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:04,340
It's utter chaos

1990
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:12,710
because that's how I felt,
you know, because you're just
so fired up. You're like,

1991
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:15,890
oh, I'm gonna do something. But
there's nothing, at least for me,

1992
01:53:15,891 --> 01:53:19,870
I kind of be construct just once,
once like it,

1993
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:23,970
from what I understand,
Adderall cousins as well.

1994
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:30,410
Even when I did Adderall, I felt like
I was getting drips and like cocaine,

1995
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:38,740
whatever it triggered was the same
fucking neighborhood as drips come from

1996
01:53:40,491 --> 01:53:43,780
actually snorting.
It felt like it

1997
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:54,290
crush it up. And we know a guy who,

1998
01:53:54,291 --> 01:53:58,050
uh, was, uh, like I, I talk, I
tell the story now on stage of,

1999
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:02,150
of the guy who used to drive us
to the airport.

2000
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:05,120
This was our driver,
like a regular guy,

2001
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:07,950
cause we go to the airport so often
we use this, you know, we found a,

2002
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,770
like a cheaper car service.

2003
01:54:09,771 --> 01:54:13,720
It's easier than dealing with like
driving and parking and like he was uh,

2004
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:17,540
you know, like a cheap
ride, basically older guy.

2005
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:21,440
And I'm like all white hair. It was
really professional. And then like,

2006
01:54:21,441 --> 01:54:24,570
after like 10 rides, one of those
things where like, you know,

2007
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:28,430
when somebody like Mr Rogan, Mr and
you finally go, you can call me Joe.

2008
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:31,460
It was like that kind of thing where I
was like, it's Tom, he's like this Tom.

2009
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:34,280
I'm like, yeah. He's like, cool. Hey
Man, let me ask you something. Like,

2010
01:54:34,281 --> 01:54:37,550
everything changed. As soon as I said,
you don't have to be professional with me.

2011
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:42,080
And he goes, uh, he goes, can
I ask you something? And I
was like, yeah. And he goes,

2012
01:54:42,081 --> 01:54:46,370
do you smoke weed? And I was like, ah,
yeah, I mean, I guess, yeah. He's like,

2013
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:50,830
do you want to smoke some now? And
I was like, really? I was like,

2014
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,860
I was like, yeah. All right. And then
you said, Yo, right? Yeah. Okay driver,

2015
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:58,790
that's exactly what you're comfortable
with you in my life. And then he goes,

2016
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,300
he starts smoking and then he goes,
uh, I can't drive unless I'm fucked up.

2017
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:07,780
That's a quo [inaudible] God.

2018
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:16,130
And then Judd Apatow,
I swear to God,

2019
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:21,650
Shit
like seventies and then he goes,

2020
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:25,670
and then he's like this more like this,
particularly in his early, he drives fast.

2021
01:55:25,671 --> 01:55:28,160
He's like, one of these, I've
been driving 50 years in La,

2022
01:55:28,161 --> 01:55:31,220
we've got to take this street.
And I was like, you know,

2023
01:55:31,221 --> 01:55:34,010
I was basically like keep it together
man. And he was like, he was like,

2024
01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:37,100
I've been up since, you know, three.
And then I'm like [inaudible] shit.

2025
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:41,360
And I started asking him, I'm like,
have you done other drugs? He's like,

2026
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:45,630
aw buddy buddy. Like I've done all. And I
was like, really? He's like coke heroin.

2027
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:49,230
And he's like, there's nothing
like smoking rocks, swear to God.

2028
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:54,970
And I was like 17 and he is flying
through El Barrio through the old

2029
01:55:55,621 --> 01:56:00,450
neighborhood. So this is an El
Salvadorian neighborhoods. Like every,

2030
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:02,280
like we're going through
lights and he's like,

2031
01:56:02,281 --> 01:56:06,070
look at that little brown one right
there. Oh, that was a little brown guy.

2032
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:09,960
He was married to a Peruvian and then he
had like an El Salvadorian girlfriend.

2033
01:56:09,961 --> 01:56:13,320
He's like, I love these little brown
was at oh one on the side. Yeah. Well,

2034
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:17,070
and yet he was like five girlfriends and
they're all like 20 and they were all

2035
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:21,690
like 20th. So we drive to
the ghetto and he'd be like,

2036
01:56:21,691 --> 01:56:22,720
that's where I used to buy

2037
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:29,520
this neighborhood's good stuff.
God.

2038
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:34,790
So we're in the, we're driving around
and I go, uh, I go, oh, I go, what?

2039
01:56:34,791 --> 01:56:37,590
Can I ask you something now that we're
friends, I guess, you know? And he's like,

2040
01:56:37,591 --> 01:56:42,330
yeah, it's true. And I was like, what's it
like to smoke crack? And he goes, oh man.

2041
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:45,690
He's like, what I like to do
and when I smoked crack is like,

2042
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:48,570
I'll just sit in my apartment where,
wait, stop, stop. Don't say anything.

2043
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:54,930
Did he say porn? Who Watches porn? No,
no, go ahead. I'm sorry. He goes, uh,

2044
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:56,130
I like to,

2045
01:56:56,130 --> 01:57:00,840
I like to look through the people and I
look around at what the fucks out and I

2046
01:57:00,841 --> 01:57:03,470
think I see all the shit I think
about what's going to happen next.

2047
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:06,030
I see people walking by and I just
kind of fucking freak out, you know?

2048
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:11,580
And I was like, this sounds terrible
man. But he was, he was like,

2049
01:57:11,581 --> 01:57:12,900
as part of the rush,
that's the rush.

2050
01:57:12,901 --> 01:57:17,901
You know what the [inaudible] is
rush to stop you because yeah,

2051
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:24,630
everybody says everybody that I've
ever talked to him and smoked crack,

2052
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:28,070
he says they watch porn
when

2053
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:33,330
we fucked like animal.
Yeah. Yeah, he did say that.

2054
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:38,900
Sorry, say his last name. Henry the ape.

2055
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:42,990
So the best is like in
this sounds like it sounds,

2056
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:46,860
I swear this is exactly how it goes.
I go, so do you still do that shit?

2057
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:51,420
And he goes, Nah man, Nah,
no. He goes, well, you know,

2058
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,830
every once in a while,

2059
01:57:52,831 --> 01:57:56,220
but you know what they say if you
do something every once in a while,

2060
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:59,850
it's not that bad for you. And I go, I
think they mean that about like pizza,

2061
01:58:00,530 --> 01:58:05,530
like chocolate [inaudible] I swear to God,

2062
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,940
every once in a while we'll,

2063
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:12,750
do you remember when the
mayor of Washington DC got
caught smoking Marion Berry?

2064
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:17,790
Yeah. With an FBI agent or
an informant. A prostitute.

2065
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:19,530
Yeah.
You remember that shit?

2066
01:58:19,531 --> 01:58:22,170
He was smoking crack and
running the nation's capitol.

2067
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,990
And then when they ask people about it,

2068
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:29,850
the greatest thing was after
he got caught, this guy,
I remember this guy on TV,

2069
01:58:29,851 --> 01:58:30,151
they say,

2070
01:58:30,151 --> 01:58:33,180
what do you think about the mayor
getting caught smoking crack goes man.

2071
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:36,370
And by some, a little crack
of it now. And then he said,

2072
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:41,800
everybody smoke a little crack every now
and then this guy was on TV. It's like,

2073
01:58:41,801 --> 01:58:42,130
come on

2074
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:46,300
man, stop playing. You stop playing.
Who doesn't? Who doesn't vote crack?

2075
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:48,340
I smoked some great little now.

2076
01:58:48,341 --> 01:58:51,280
And then I was on Opie and
Anthony and he was in the hallway.

2077
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,430
We were in the serious
studios, you know, so there's,

2078
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:58,600
there's a big window you could see who's
walking down the hallway and Marion

2079
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,310
Barry was walking down
the hallway. So, uh,

2080
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:03,280
one of the interns from the opiate Anthony
show, or maybe it was, was it Eric?

2081
01:59:03,281 --> 01:59:05,950
Who Was it?
He went out and grabbed him,

2082
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:10,540
grab Marion Barry and brought him into
one of the most hostile radio shows in

2083
01:59:10,541 --> 01:59:14,170
the history of the fucking human
race because of the best. So yeah,

2084
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:17,140
he sits some area of barrier there and
we just started asking him questions

2085
01:59:17,141 --> 01:59:19,450
about getting caught with crack.
And one of the things he says,

2086
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:24,040
nobody knows what was in that
pipe. Oh, what? That's you,

2087
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:27,570
you were sweating and saying, I wasn't
doing that pipe. And I'm like, well,

2088
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:29,630
there was a video or
you smoking Craig isn't,

2089
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:34,000
nobody knows what was in that pipe like
we, wow. Wow. Still denying it political.

2090
01:59:34,001 --> 01:59:36,520
How political. Very.
He's still got a career.

2091
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:39,850
He's still out there making it happen.
He's out there.

2092
01:59:39,851 --> 01:59:44,680
He was running for something. Yeah. And
he also did become arrogant, but he also,

2093
01:59:44,681 --> 01:59:49,420
he ran for something during
the last elections. I forget
what it was. Maybe. Well,

2094
01:59:49,421 --> 01:59:50,141
you know what,
man,

2095
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:53,940
a lot of what being a fucking mayor is
about is not what you do with your freak

2096
01:59:53,941 --> 01:59:55,570
time.
It's about what you do with your,

2097
01:59:55,670 --> 01:59:59,560
the rest of the time they felt like
he was actually representing them.

2098
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:02,590
So he was out there just keeping it real

2099
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:10,810
by smoking, do a crack every now and
then. I'm there for you with that guy.

2100
02:00:10,811 --> 02:00:14,680
He wasn't annoying, man. Come
on with this. What is this now?

2101
02:00:14,681 --> 02:00:18,790
Since Ted Haggard? Yes.
Yeah. Not only is he back,

2102
02:00:18,791 --> 02:00:20,800
but he's brilliant and
the way he approaches it,

2103
02:00:20,801 --> 02:00:23,080
that everyone in his whole thing,
oh,

2104
02:00:23,081 --> 02:00:27,790
we have drug dealers and prostitutes
and everybody looking to be saved.

2105
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:29,770
You know,
it's like we've all lost our way,

2106
02:00:29,771 --> 02:00:31,900
but God is still there and I'm
still going to lead you to God.

2107
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:39,940
I'm still married, but he's
gay as fuck. Fuck. He's, uh,

2108
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,020
he's just, you know, he's, he's, uh,
he's just fighting it. That shit.

2109
02:00:44,021 --> 02:00:45,720
You just ran the gamut.
What? You watch that,

2110
02:00:45,721 --> 02:00:49,740
you watch that documentary and you see
him with his wife and they're like the

2111
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:54,100
drive and they're just trying to get the
car. But he's like, he's, as he's talking,

2112
02:00:54,101 --> 02:00:57,610
you're like, man, you would be so much
happier if you would just get up, be like,

2113
02:00:57,611 --> 02:01:01,000
I'm totally gay. I'll see you later.
Just go be happy man. Like you.

2114
02:01:01,001 --> 02:01:03,400
You don't have to be that miserable.
Well then there's that,

2115
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:06,820
but there's also the intoxication of
being a leader. Yeah. He loves it.

2116
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:11,470
He's addicted to that. Yeah. A lot
of the behavior is not genuine.

2117
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:13,620
A lot of what his behavior is,
his,

2118
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:16,670
he's behaving the way
he thinks people were,

2119
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:20,890
are going to accept the way
he thinks people are going
to find admirable and how,

2120
02:01:20,891 --> 02:01:23,290
you know, it's like his,
his real behavior. He like,

2121
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:27,000
he's not being honest with himself and
if he's not being honest with themselves,

2122
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:28,690
how the fuck could he be
honest with other people?

2123
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:33,170
He's gaining control and all these
other people's lives, you know, and,

2124
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:35,200
and fighting off the lack of control.

2125
02:01:35,201 --> 02:01:38,320
He hasn't at all know he needs
to be like a leader of a church.

2126
02:01:38,330 --> 02:01:40,400
Needs to be the speaking right.
He wanted,

2127
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:44,480
he's like praise the critical piece
of shit. You on your mind phobic.

2128
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:49,220
Meanwhile he's smoking meth
and again, gay huggers, Morris,

2129
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:51,530
kind of hypocritical
once all the congressmen,

2130
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:57,380
absolute all the guys that tell
you how to live and criticize you.

2131
02:01:57,550 --> 02:02:02,390
Cora, you live. Why? Why would you
care if if you look, I don't want to,

2132
02:02:02,391 --> 02:02:05,930
I might not want to live on Santa Monica
Boulevard while the fucking gay parade

2133
02:02:05,931 --> 02:02:07,040
is going on.
I don't know.

2134
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:13,010
I mean I don't want it to be so that I
can't drive it in my driveway without

2135
02:02:13,011 --> 02:02:16,640
tripping over dudes on my lawn.
I don't want it to be that bad.

2136
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:19,190
Can you mentioned tripping
over boners that'd be so weird.

2137
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,350
Cough out of the ground.

2138
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:28,370
That piece of human shit.
Who is that?

2139
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:31,280
He's running for the
Republican presidential.

2140
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:35,900
He's a huge homophobic piece.
It's probably good. He also,

2141
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:40,130
he also wants to, he wants to
make, not only is it really

2142
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:44,970
not just abortion, he wants to take
away birth control to control the Queen.

2143
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:46,640
Cause he said that's not what it's for.

2144
02:02:46,641 --> 02:02:50,050
If you're using birth control like
you're not there for few, well

2145
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:52,330
who the fuck are you?
Stupid. Well, you know, it's,

2146
02:02:52,331 --> 02:02:54,280
people with their priorities
are so out of whack.

2147
02:02:54,281 --> 02:02:57,890
Like why would you even be that good? Why
would that be what you want to consult?

2148
02:02:58,320 --> 02:02:59,890
You give a shit,
people having sex,

2149
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:03,550
you want to take a way birth control you
crazy answer. You want to make people,

2150
02:03:03,551 --> 02:03:07,900
it make it easier for people to get
pregnant accidentally because that's God's

2151
02:03:07,901 --> 02:03:12,550
will morons even care about what the
gays are doing because he wants some gate

2152
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,510
dick fighting off the gay chosen now.
Right?

2153
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:20,640
Real motherfucker all
day, all day, all night.

2154
02:03:20,950 --> 02:03:23,200
Clon off that gay trying to push it back.

2155
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:26,900
No.
Say Allen dates.

2156
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:30,490
It's a sad thing when you see these
poor fucking people suppressing people.

2157
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,190
You know, what do you think about
this occupy Wall Street shit,

2158
02:03:33,191 --> 02:03:36,090
I haven't talked to you about this.
What's your take on all of this? Uh,

2159
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:41,370
I think it's great that a group of
people want to like feel this way about,

2160
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:45,160
there's a lot of inequality.
I think it's, it's great,

2161
02:03:45,161 --> 02:03:48,340
like collectively the problem,

2162
02:03:48,370 --> 02:03:51,080
like the real flaw in
occupy Wall Street and he,

2163
02:03:51,081 --> 02:03:56,020
the things is that there's not a clear
set of what they're trying to achieve.

2164
02:03:56,021 --> 02:03:58,930
It almost like this, you know, uh,

2165
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:01,000
over like let's just do this
collectively as society.

2166
02:04:01,001 --> 02:04:05,290
We're making a statement about
being the 99% and you guys,

2167
02:04:05,291 --> 02:04:07,150
the 1% has and where the have nots.

2168
02:04:07,151 --> 02:04:12,151
But I think it would have
been more effective if they
had had like a clear list

2169
02:04:12,521 --> 02:04:15,640
of like this is what we want to
accomplish. And it was, it's more,

2170
02:04:15,641 --> 02:04:19,990
I feel like having watched
it from outside, I'm not an
expert on it by any means,

2171
02:04:19,991 --> 02:04:22,720
but it just feels like it's more
of a statement and you go, Oh yeah,

2172
02:04:23,170 --> 02:04:27,510
it makes people aware, but there isn't
really like, you know, course of action.

2173
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:32,080
They're not really
trying to figure that out for sure.

2174
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:34,210
So I think,
you know,

2175
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:37,150
it's interesting and I
think the message really,

2176
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:42,290
this if I feel like what I get from it
as if is if you really could get a lot,

2177
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:45,600
and I mean a ton of people
behind a certain idea,

2178
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:48,210
you can affect change.
We're not going to see,

2179
02:04:48,211 --> 02:04:52,050
I don't think we're seeing a lot of
change from the entire occupy movement,

2180
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:53,730
but the idea,

2181
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:58,260
it kind of lays out for you that like
they could take over a park or a square or

2182
02:04:58,261 --> 02:05:02,520
a street and disrupt that days,
you know, normal function.

2183
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:04,080
And if you were to magnify that,

2184
02:05:04,081 --> 02:05:07,350
if you were to multiply the number of
people there and you really had people

2185
02:05:07,351 --> 02:05:11,670
saying we are not going to stand for this,
it leads me to believe that you would,

2186
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:16,480
you could affect change. Do you know
what I mean? Sure. It's a whole culture.

2187
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:18,650
No, this is what's really
interesting is that this only,

2188
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:21,080
it's only been around for like what,
90 days or something like that. I mean,

2189
02:05:21,081 --> 02:05:23,900
how many days? Yeah. And you
know, they did a recent poll,

2190
02:05:23,901 --> 02:05:26,650
more than half of America supports
the occupy Wall Street movement.

2191
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:29,990
We're not going to participate
during the Vietnam War.

2192
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:32,930
It took five years to
achieve those same numbers.

2193
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:37,010
It took a long time of protesting for
people really thought that the war was a

2194
02:05:37,011 --> 02:05:38,300
bad idea.
You know,

2195
02:05:38,450 --> 02:05:42,890
people in the 1950s had convinced
everybody that communism was going to be a

2196
02:05:42,891 --> 02:05:44,120
real problem.
And you know,

2197
02:05:44,121 --> 02:05:47,480
we were looking for communists in our own
society and they were arresting people

2198
02:05:47,481 --> 02:05:49,820
during the McCarthy era and
stuff like that. You know,

2199
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:53,750
and I think during the 60s people
were a tad naive too. You know,

2200
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:56,390
how really fucked up and
creepy the government could be.

2201
02:05:56,570 --> 02:05:58,930
We had just gone a
couple of generations or,

2202
02:05:58,931 --> 02:06:01,790
or I mean rather a couple decades
from world war two ending.

2203
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,270
So I think a lot of people thought
that the government was, you know,

2204
02:06:05,271 --> 02:06:09,470
just in our army was strong and we fought
off the Nazis and we fought off the

2205
02:06:09,471 --> 02:06:13,550
jabs and we're fucking America and we're
not [inaudible]. And then this whole,

2206
02:06:13,730 --> 02:06:18,630
you know, the Gulf of Tonkin
incident happened and you know, we,

2207
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,260
we were brought into a ward there.

2208
02:06:20,261 --> 02:06:24,350
There's no fucking reason to be in
Vietnam for any, any American idea,

2209
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:27,770
for anything that any people here that
would have supported, they lied to us.

2210
02:06:27,771 --> 02:06:31,730
They lied to people they claimed were
attack when weren't they made up bullshit.

2211
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:33,530
So I think,
you know,

2212
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:38,480
the people are today or we are aware
of all these things in a much larger

2213
02:06:38,481 --> 02:06:39,860
numbers to,
to this day.

2214
02:06:39,861 --> 02:06:42,710
I bet a lot of people don't realize
that the impetus for us getting into the

2215
02:06:42,711 --> 02:06:44,600
Vietnam War was a hoax.
You know,

2216
02:06:44,601 --> 02:06:48,260
I bet a lot of people aren't aware to
this day of operation Northwoods or all

2217
02:06:48,261 --> 02:06:52,990
the plans, you know, there
was plans to blame, uh, if,

2218
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:55,370
if space program things went wrong,

2219
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:58,610
there was plans to blame it
on the Cubans and attack Cuba.

2220
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:01,940
There was a bunch of different plans to
blame things on Cubans and attack Cubans.

2221
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:02,781
Yeah. Yeah. There was a,

2222
02:07:02,781 --> 02:07:06,920
they were trying really hard to figure
out a way to go to war with cube cube to

2223
02:07:06,921 --> 02:07:10,010
the point where they were going to
fake attacks on American civilians.

2224
02:07:10,011 --> 02:07:10,700
They're gonna fail.

2225
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:15,490
They're gonna armed Cuban friendlies to
lob mortars at Guantanamo Bay and attack

2226
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:20,150
Guantanamo Bay. I mean, there's
some crazy shit. It really is crazy.

2227
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:23,540
Which by the way, Guantanamo Bay,
that's pretty fucking crazy too.

2228
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:25,130
When you think of these
people that are enemies,

2229
02:07:25,131 --> 02:07:29,090
one of them has a giant military base on
your fucking country. I've been there.

2230
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:32,300
I've been up to, how's
that like, dude? Um, well,

2231
02:07:32,301 --> 02:07:35,530
the first thing that strikes
you really is that it's

2232
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,180
so beautiful. Real, and that's
kind of the, the, you know, the,

2233
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:43,690
the thing that stands out to you
is your, you, you imagine like,

2234
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:47,020
I'm going to a military base
that also has the worlds,

2235
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:50,290
one of the world's most
notorious prison camps,

2236
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:54,990
and it's all in a underdeveloped,
uh,

2237
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:57,700
Caribbean waters because crazy rats,
well,

2238
02:07:57,701 --> 02:08:01,600
they do the banana rat fucking blow
your mind, but you got to look it up.

2239
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:05,080
You've got to look at it. They're
all over the, I look it up.

2240
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:08,890
They're all over the island and you shit
when you first see them. Really? Yeah,

2241
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:11,990
they have guys,
Holy Shit.

2242
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:17,110
God, they're all over the place. Yeah.

2243
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:21,620
The size of this fucking thing.
Oh,

2244
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:25,720
there's some really cool
stuff. Yes. That's kind of
cute for a ride. Take a banana.

2245
02:08:25,721 --> 02:08:28,180
Right? Then here's how.
Here's how bad the problem is.

2246
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:31,600
There's guys on base that are not like,
it's not even,

2247
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:34,120
they're not even military guys.
They got hired.

2248
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:38,890
They give them a 22 and their job
is at night. You just drive around,

2249
02:08:38,930 --> 02:08:43,420
you're shining up and you just show me
or they like,

2250
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:47,790
it's not the same as a nutria. Is it
there? They're not exactly the same. No.

2251
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:50,390
Look at this. Picture it there.
Right? Tell me when. Shoot that.

2252
02:08:50,730 --> 02:08:55,070
Shoot it when you shoot that thing,
dude, it weird things. I'm handsome.

2253
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,940
One seat your babies every way there
right now and I think wants to innovate,

2254
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:01,180
but you fucking Rad.
If you left it alone with the baby,

2255
02:09:01,181 --> 02:09:05,200
it would slowly eat its feet. Fuck yeah,
it would eat your baby's feet. So you see,

2256
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:10,360
you see the coastline and you see the
water and you see, it's basically what,

2257
02:09:10,361 --> 02:09:12,110
how much of the Caribbean
is underdeveloped.

2258
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:15,790
You basically see what the island
looked like. She's 500 years ago. Brian,

2259
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:20,190
look at this picture. You get a
better picture of this one. Yeah.

2260
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,420
You know that, um, they got me one night,

2261
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:26,830
they made me scream high pitch
scream this, uh, you know,

2262
02:09:26,831 --> 02:09:29,830
a Dan Smith, the comedian.
Dan Smith. Yeah. Uh, I was,

2263
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:33,970
I was there with him and a
couple other guys, Mel Hall
and uh, uh, what's his name,

2264
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:36,430
Patrick to gear. We
were all there. And uh,

2265
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:40,610
we get out of this pan and they
had talked about, uh, uh, we,

2266
02:09:40,611 --> 02:09:42,580
we pull up in the van, they're
like, there's a banana right,

2267
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:45,010
right there and the
lights of the van or on,

2268
02:09:45,011 --> 02:09:49,510
so we get out of the van and we all walk
kind of clothes. And they know that.

2269
02:09:49,511 --> 02:09:52,270
They told us, you know, they eat
vegetables or like the shrub there,

2270
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:56,740
they're not like predatory. So we
stopped, but it's still a gross, massive.

2271
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:59,440
So I sneak up and I'm kinda like,
you know,

2272
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:04,270
I'm still like six feet from it and right
as I squat down to like look and kind

2273
02:10:04,271 --> 02:10:08,590
of squint my eyes, Dan runs his fingers
up my, my neck like this and he goes like,

2274
02:10:08,650 --> 02:10:09,550
oh, there it is. And I go,

2275
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:13,330
I scream and like run like I'm
terrified at this fucking thing.

2276
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:17,740
It is the grossest looking for and it's
massive. It's like a fucking dog man.

2277
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:22,510
It's a rat. The size of a dog you
jump. I mean it's their gross. Oh,

2278
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:26,730
terrifying. And Gross Joe.
Stop masturbating willing.
Tom's Tom. I have to,

2279
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,490
I have to relieve myself.

2280
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:34,400
The fears,
the fears often Tara County

2281
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,910
and they had like, what do they have feral
that raccoons, you couldn't feed them.

2282
02:10:37,911 --> 02:10:40,910
They're just like everywhere. Really.
I don't know. Cause you know there's,

2283
02:10:40,911 --> 02:10:44,840
there's a military base there. I did.
I didn't know that they were dangerous.

2284
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:48,470
What was friend raccoons? I didn't,
I know growing up with raccoons,

2285
02:10:48,471 --> 02:10:51,680
I live in the La huge problem with
a raccoon. When I lived in New York,

2286
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:56,630
lived in new Rochelle. Where's that?
Michelle is right outside the Bronx.

2287
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:59,150
It's like a suburb.
When I moved to New York,

2288
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:02,180
I couldn't afford to live in the city.
You live in the city.

2289
02:11:02,181 --> 02:11:03,230
It's much more expensive.

2290
02:11:03,231 --> 02:11:06,500
So I lived in like the summers and I
drove and I needed a car anyway because I

2291
02:11:06,501 --> 02:11:11,010
drove to gigs and I had to have like a
place where I could park my car because I

2292
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:11,331
just,

2293
02:11:11,331 --> 02:11:15,020
no way I could afford to live in apartment
in New York and have us parking spot.

2294
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:17,630
Like you have to buy a parking spot
somewhere. It's fucking brutal.

2295
02:11:17,631 --> 02:11:19,490
It's really expensive. So, uh,

2296
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:24,080
I had to pull down this driveway and I
would stop my car right in front of the

2297
02:11:24,081 --> 02:11:26,660
garbage cans and when I
would come home at night,

2298
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:31,310
it was fucking terrifying cause he's,
raccoons were big,

2299
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:35,090
they were really big and they were
really well fed because they were just

2300
02:11:35,091 --> 02:11:38,300
fucking people's garbage cans up
left and right because you know,

2301
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:40,550
you're dealing with a house after
house after house and garbage can,

2302
02:11:40,551 --> 02:11:41,690
if the garbage can,
garbage can.

2303
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:45,350
So they're just eating constantly and
they know exactly what the food is.

2304
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:48,740
So they pull the tops off that bitch
throw that motherfucker on the ground.

2305
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:49,603
I mean they,

2306
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:54,850
they pull them to the restaurant and I
get out of my car and this mother fucker

2307
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:59,980
is looking at me like fucking backwards
up and shit and I'm thinking this thing

2308
02:12:00,261 --> 02:12:04,850
charges me. I'm fucked. I'm a
dad. So I got a blowgun and uh,

2309
02:12:04,851 --> 02:12:08,510
you know like with darts,
you know, logo, you

2310
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:14,210
get that at a gun show.
Went to a gun show.

2311
02:12:14,211 --> 02:12:16,220
That was the only thing you get if
you don't have a license for a gun.

2312
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:18,043
I got a blow gun.

2313
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:21,890
Did you ever say your can
these motherfuckers must
have known I had a blow gun.

2314
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:25,670
I swear to God he never came back.
Really? Yeah. The raccoon never came back.

2315
02:12:25,671 --> 02:12:28,550
It's almost like he has sensed
something predatory. He sends,

2316
02:12:28,551 --> 02:12:32,510
I was w laying a trap for his ass or he
just found some fat people down the hall,

2317
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:37,370
got some awesome garbage look.
Got their garbage every night.

2318
02:12:37,371 --> 02:12:41,870
It's pizza cross and flock. Yeah, we got
the spot. I never saw that raccoon again,

2319
02:12:41,871 --> 02:12:43,430
but he was fucking huge man.

2320
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:47,480
I know people in Florida that would go
hunting with a semiautomatic machine,

2321
02:12:47,481 --> 02:12:48,530
guns down raccoons,

2322
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:54,640
flashlights and then with like
ar 15 Florida is so crazy,

2323
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:59,760
Lord. It is not the south. No, it's
not the south and it's not the norm.

2324
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,600
It's the southern most port,
part part of the United States,

2325
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:05,460
but it's not considered the south.
Isn't that amazing? The south,

2326
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:09,140
does anyone have anything to do with
Florida? Really? Time to south ones.

2327
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:11,530
Anything to do with Florida
is when you go well learned.

2328
02:13:11,531 --> 02:13:16,030
Skinner came from Florida. You got me,
you got me. You got me like a hybrid.

2329
02:13:16,070 --> 02:13:18,410
It is like a strip mall.
The state

2330
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:23,150
dirty strip mall.
Vesty even the best parts of Florida,

2331
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:26,570
like whenever I'm in Miami, I loved
the people down there. They're fun,

2332
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:29,090
they're fun. I love, I love
going down there and do gigs,

2333
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:32,370
but I always put myself in a position I,
what if I had to move to Florida?

2334
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,190
What would I do? I'd be like, yeah,

2335
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:37,350
I just think about my kids growing
up in Florida and being raped.

2336
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:42,030
It's like a hopeless [inaudible] bro. I
know. It's nice. My parents lived there.

2337
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:46,090
My parents live in a real nice place.
There's something wrong with that state.

2338
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:47,430
It's not a coincidence.

2339
02:13:47,431 --> 02:13:50,550
It's so many fucking serial killers
and psychos come from that spot.

2340
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:51,630
That's also where you go.

2341
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:54,330
If you're like cycling and like
we're gonna fuck some shit off

2342
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,870
snow.
In my mind,

2343
02:13:57,871 --> 02:14:01,950
I grew up or I knew a lot of shady
people when I was a kid and everyone

2344
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:06,040
eventually went to Florida. They all went
down to Florida. They moved to Florida.

2345
02:14:06,050 --> 02:14:09,510
My fucking sister moved down to Florida
or shady husband moved down to Florida.

2346
02:14:09,690 --> 02:14:13,340
My fucking parents moved down to Florida
and they're attracted to it. It's like

2347
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:18,750
until the sky becomes a
fucking brick wall of rain.

2348
02:14:18,930 --> 02:14:19,950
Have you ever had that happen?

2349
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:24,390
You got to stop your car to stop the car
on the highway because you can't drive.

2350
02:14:24,570 --> 02:14:27,090
I don't think people understand what
kind of rain we're talking about.

2351
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:33,060
Eddie Bravo had a seminar in Miami.
We drove from uh,

2352
02:14:33,150 --> 02:14:36,780
from Fort Lauderdale down in Miami. It was
at like 15, 20 minutes. Not even right.

2353
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:41,760
We're on the highway. We can't go
anywhere. You literally can't drive.

2354
02:14:41,761 --> 02:14:44,280
And it feels like your
car is getting fucked up.

2355
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,640
Whooshing down. It's like a years
where the rain all in one blast.

2356
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:54,360
It's incredible.
I highway stopped dead all the time.

2357
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:58,020
That's not even know about that shit.

2358
02:14:58,021 --> 02:15:00,510
That type of rain too is
like you think like, oh,

2359
02:15:00,511 --> 02:15:03,060
that must be like a
tropical storm or hurricane,

2360
02:15:03,061 --> 02:15:06,970
which have given both of those and
they're horrifying and like crazy.

2361
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,170
You can't believe that it's just rain.
That's just an afternoon shower.

2362
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:11,070
That's just hard,
man.

2363
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:15,180
That ain't shit that the hurricane is
that times a million plus flying trees

2364
02:15:16,290 --> 02:15:20,310
hurricane yet. Ooh. I was at a
hurricane in Boston and I remember,

2365
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,590
I don't remember what year,
but by the time it got up to us,

2366
02:15:22,591 --> 02:15:26,130
everybody was just scared and huddled
in and now we were, we lived in Newton.

2367
02:15:26,131 --> 02:15:27,510
We were pretty far inland.

2368
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:30,480
The real people that had to worry where
like the people that are on the shore

2369
02:15:30,481 --> 02:15:32,670
and how wicked was the hurricane.
It's wicked.

2370
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:36,510
Pisser came in and talked
to every body sideways.

2371
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:42,840
It's crazy. It's just like a big
hurricane though. Is it like a three?

2372
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:45,240
If I had a choice between moving back
to Boston and live in in Florida,

2373
02:15:45,241 --> 02:15:49,920
I take Boston a fucking heartbeat.
Hit winters and all. Fuck. Yeah.

2374
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:54,570
First of all, they have a sense of
humor versus Florida. You'd pick, fuck,

2375
02:15:55,890 --> 02:16:00,060
no doubt about it. Are you kidding
me? Human beings and Boston.

2376
02:16:00,061 --> 02:16:03,030
It does not compare.
Just being around the human beings,

2377
02:16:03,031 --> 02:16:06,480
you'd have way more fun in Boston.
[inaudible] times more fun.

2378
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:10,260
I'll tell you way more fun way. The
further steps smarter too. In Florida,

2379
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:12,650
it gets crazier, more aggressive. Miami,

2380
02:16:12,651 --> 02:16:14,310
so you might as well be
in a foreign country.

2381
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:18,600
I haven't fucking passport to go to Miami.
Check you at the border.

2382
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:23,700
You guys are thinking of all the
bad parts of the Florida so much.

2383
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:27,540
Tommy and Tommy and I do. I mean,
I've done a bunch of gigs in Florida.

2384
02:16:27,541 --> 02:16:31,210
We did the Florida comedy festival. We
did theater down in Miami. We've done a,

2385
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:35,660
the Improv a couple of times.
We've done a bunch of gigs. Look,

2386
02:16:35,870 --> 02:16:37,800
it's fun.
I'm done with that,

2387
02:16:37,801 --> 02:16:41,950
but I caught that place out of my diet
and the early two thousands me and Joey

2388
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:46,640
Diaz used to go down there because Joey
knew the guy who was the original owner

2389
02:16:46,641 --> 02:16:48,310
is always like, let me get
a drawer. He and Julia,

2390
02:16:48,311 --> 02:16:51,670
that was back when Joey was in a dark
days and it would just get money and they

2391
02:16:51,671 --> 02:16:51,851
did.

2392
02:16:51,851 --> 02:16:54,550
The club owners would be reluctant to
give him money because he might disappear.

2393
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:58,810
Call you from Havana on a fucking rap dog.
I don't know how to got here,

2394
02:16:58,830 --> 02:17:02,770
but it looks like I'm stuck, you
know. And uh, we would go to these,

2395
02:17:03,070 --> 02:17:07,000
do these shows at the Miami Improv and
the whole crowd would break out into a

2396
02:17:07,001 --> 02:17:10,560
fucking discussion, like over
nothing real chatty. Yeah.

2397
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:13,690
I had a joke where I mentioned Oscar
de la Hoya. Somehow or another,

2398
02:17:13,691 --> 02:17:16,990
it was like a part of a joke that I used
to do something about getting punched

2399
02:17:16,991 --> 02:17:20,660
by Oscar de la Hoya and then
somebody goes, fuck Oscar de la Hoya

2400
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:27,130
and it, and then it was like, he's a
bitch. Julio, Cesar Chavez is the man.

2401
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:32,200
And then it became this fucking
crazy argument amongst apes.

2402
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:36,460
They might as well. They
might as well. Chimpanzees is,

2403
02:17:36,461 --> 02:17:37,540
someone taught how to talk.

2404
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:40,420
They were just the dumbest human
beings I've ever been around.

2405
02:17:40,530 --> 02:17:44,470
And the rest of the crowd was the people
who are forced to live around these

2406
02:17:44,471 --> 02:17:47,290
more on kids.
And so they would just like sighing,

2407
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:51,070
like shaking her head back and forth
like, oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, but it was a,

2408
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:54,400
it was a savage crowd. Like they,
they had not tamed that crowd.

2409
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:58,450
And because of that, the most unruly
of the unruly, the dumbest of the dump.

2410
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:01,450
We're drawn to that club and they
papered the fuck out of the room.

2411
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,740
Your original owner was,

2412
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:06,430
he was the GAC out hardcore
and he really wasn't doing it.

2413
02:18:08,910 --> 02:18:13,810
And so he wasn't, he wasn't taking care
of the place correctly. Apparently.

2414
02:18:13,811 --> 02:18:16,930
I don't, I don't know. Try it. These,
this is allegedly, this is all allegedly,

2415
02:18:17,050 --> 02:18:21,950
I'm not trying Miami and profits.
It's fun now. Fuck you. It's fun.

2416
02:18:21,951 --> 02:18:25,030
I remember the day where I was on stage
where there, this was breaking out

2417
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:30,880
and I stopped in the middle of my set.
I go, you people are way too dominant.

2418
02:18:30,881 --> 02:18:34,600
I'm never coming back here. I'm like,
this is ridiculous. Did you come out,

2419
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,730
you came out to to a comedy show and you
want to yell at out who's your favorite

2420
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:43,480
was like the, there was the impulsiveness.
It was like there was no discipline.

2421
02:18:43,630 --> 02:18:44,351
There was nothing.

2422
02:18:44,351 --> 02:18:48,880
I mean it was like literally like you were
around the brattiest kids ever bought,

2423
02:18:48,881 --> 02:18:52,050
they were drinking and that somehow
or another they were 21 yeah.

2424
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:55,990
You know the brattiest kids and just felt
like they could just yell things down

2425
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,010
and it's like, does anybody ever tell
you to shut the fuck ever? I know.

2426
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:01,930
Does anybody ever tell you to shut
the fuck up because this is nonsense.

2427
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:05,360
This is your, you have to be a crazy
person to come to a comedy club in.

2428
02:19:05,361 --> 02:19:06,430
It'd be this unaware.

2429
02:19:06,530 --> 02:19:08,300
Well, yeah. Can I ask you something?

2430
02:19:08,301 --> 02:19:10,880
Because this happened to me at
the comedy store on Saturday.

2431
02:19:10,881 --> 02:19:15,881
Like have you ever had someone just make
a comment in the crowd or just say some

2432
02:19:16,401 --> 02:19:18,410
shit to you that enrages you?

2433
02:19:18,411 --> 02:19:23,360
Like it hits a trigger and you so fucking
hard. That's what they're trying to do.

2434
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:27,020
Yeah. And you see red and you're like,
I'm going to fucking like I this guy,

2435
02:19:27,050 --> 02:19:28,010
big animated

2436
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:32,720
troll face that. That's,
that's what they have.

2437
02:19:32,721 --> 02:19:34,400
They won.
What did he say?

2438
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:36,160
What do you do?
It was so stupid.

2439
02:19:36,161 --> 02:19:39,790
Like I was talking about birth control
pill and how they market it and they

2440
02:19:39,791 --> 02:19:43,920
always say it's to regularly, it was a
dumb throw. It was a minute thing. Right.

2441
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:45,940
And I don't usually,
I don't talk about my period.

2442
02:19:45,941 --> 02:19:49,830
I know that's a fucking female
comic. Cliche. And I know, and he,

2443
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:53,380
he made an audible, ugh. And I fucking,

2444
02:19:53,650 --> 02:19:57,070
I went bonkers because he had a woman
with him and in my head I'm thinking,

2445
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:00,520
asshole, you're with a
woman. You fucked that woman.

2446
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,680
Put your mouth on her vagina.
Babies come out of that. But

2447
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:10,470
yeah. Why are you so offended at the,
at the just the sheer man? I don't,

2448
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:12,730
like I said, it wasn't a bit
about it. I didn't go into it.

2449
02:20:12,731 --> 02:20:15,670
It was a throwaway line I
had said and it immediately,

2450
02:20:15,671 --> 02:20:18,370
if for whatever reason I wanted
to fucking kill that guy.

2451
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:20,720
Well,
because your instincts are correct.

2452
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:24,830
The guys that Douche bag and what was
really going on was that the guy is

2453
02:20:24,831 --> 02:20:29,510
probably insecure and he probably wanted
to impress the girl by being more funny

2454
02:20:29,511 --> 02:20:34,511
than you or by criticizing you or
maybe came in with really close minded

2455
02:20:34,641 --> 02:20:38,740
expectation. Like chicks aren't
funny. His fucking truck up there, I,

2456
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:42,510
you know I did well, yeah, everything
after that. Well, you know, one,

2457
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:45,470
maybe he had a shut the fuck up because
he knew that he was going to get crushed

2458
02:20:45,650 --> 02:20:47,540
and then he was our, oh my
God, I'm getting no pussy now.

2459
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,770
I'm a lorry Merde a loser. Yeah.
You know, he'd probably pan out.

2460
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,430
That'll probably got a little cocky.

2461
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:57,860
You fucking just flex them and he panicked
and he went into a goddamn tailspin.

2462
02:20:58,210 --> 02:20:59,043
Yeah,
I see.

2463
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:02,320
But then like how do you deal with people
like [inaudible] say shit that makes

2464
02:21:02,321 --> 02:21:03,960
you like,
it just triggers your thing.

2465
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:08,700
You gotta be saying, look, it's all snake
poison. This is what it is. I need help.

2466
02:21:08,701 --> 02:21:12,030
Can you get bit when you get there by
snake, the first time you get fucked up,

2467
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:15,690
it's venomous. It's through tears.
You Up, you sick, you could die.

2468
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:18,600
But after those fucking guys
and handle snakes all the time,

2469
02:21:18,780 --> 02:21:20,700
when they get bit those mother fuckers,

2470
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:23,160
they're immune to the shed because they
give themselves injections of snake

2471
02:21:23,161 --> 02:21:24,570
venom. They do it on purpose. They fork.

2472
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:27,720
It's like a comic forcing themselves to
do a spot of the comedy store Tuesday at

2473
02:21:27,721 --> 02:21:30,150
one o'clock in the morning
giving yourself snake venom.

2474
02:21:30,151 --> 02:21:32,500
The only people there were
junkies are fucking a waste toy.

2475
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:34,410
Like it will work or you know,

2476
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:37,240
drunk tourists had just
wandered in from off the street.

2477
02:21:37,730 --> 02:21:40,970
It's not like it's a comedy kind
of sewer audience. Right, right.

2478
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:42,000
But that snake venom,

2479
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:45,360
they get a little snake venom in you and
after a while you become immune to it.

2480
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:48,480
And then when people yell things out,
then you can go, why are you yelling?

2481
02:21:48,570 --> 02:21:51,190
What's going on with you?
And then you,

2482
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:53,640
then you turn it on them and then
they become a part of the show.

2483
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:56,280
My issue with it is then it's
a different kind of comedy.

2484
02:21:56,281 --> 02:22:00,570
People enjoy it because they love off
the cuff shit. They love watching.

2485
02:22:00,571 --> 02:22:02,520
Hackles get destroyed.
People get a kick out of that shit,

2486
02:22:02,521 --> 02:22:04,620
but at the end of the day
it's a different show.

2487
02:22:04,621 --> 02:22:06,180
You're not doing your set anymore much.

2488
02:22:06,210 --> 02:22:10,350
What's much better is that you get
to do your set unfucked with, yeah,

2489
02:22:10,351 --> 02:22:13,170
I can do that, man. I do
question and answers why?

2490
02:22:13,171 --> 02:22:17,970
I'll do like an hour more and I'll
just let people yell out anything and I

2491
02:22:17,971 --> 02:22:20,160
talked to the people in the
crowd do that all the time,

2492
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:23,520
but that's after I've already done
my material. Man, don't interrupt.

2493
02:22:23,580 --> 02:22:26,010
That's gross and only
people that do that are

2494
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:29,100
idiots. You have to be an idiot
to yell at a movie theater.

2495
02:22:29,190 --> 02:22:31,260
You have to be an idiot
to yell at a comedy show,

2496
02:22:31,261 --> 02:22:34,470
to try to get someone's intention to
try to interrupt and inject your own

2497
02:22:34,471 --> 02:22:37,840
bullshit. I always tell the man, look, you
go to an open mic night, something hard.

2498
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:39,390
You could do it.
I know you do.

2499
02:22:39,391 --> 02:22:41,640
I know you're insecure and
this is the easy way to do it,

2500
02:22:41,641 --> 02:22:44,310
but really you want attention, you want
attention that you don't fucking deserve,

2501
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,620
and instead of going through the proper
channels to get this attention on,

2502
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:49,050
what you're doing is trying to usurp
it from someone who has achieved it.

2503
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:50,370
Here you are on the stage,

2504
02:22:50,371 --> 02:22:53,250
you've gone through the portal
part of getting hired by the club.

2505
02:22:53,251 --> 02:22:54,810
You've got television
credits, you're, you know,

2506
02:22:54,811 --> 02:22:57,300
you're established standup comedian,
seasoned by the road.

2507
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:00,870
You're on the stage and this person
literally wants to jump into your spot.

2508
02:23:00,871 --> 02:23:03,240
Like automatically,
like you serve your business.

2509
02:23:03,590 --> 02:23:06,190
They're essentially trying to
steal your bike. Yeah, yeah.

2510
02:23:06,690 --> 02:23:10,330
It's, it's so, yeah. I don't agree with
the mentality. I don't understand that.

2511
02:23:10,331 --> 02:23:12,500
I would never,
it's fucking crazy.

2512
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:17,440
I would say only losers do that shit.
You're not going to take a winner.

2513
02:23:17,530 --> 02:23:18,910
There's no winner in the world.

2514
02:23:18,911 --> 02:23:20,770
No person who's got their
shit together in the world,

2515
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:24,850
who wants to yell out and cause attention
to the south of the comedy show and

2516
02:23:24,970 --> 02:23:29,970
that's a sign of immaturity or just a
lack of objective analysis of their own

2517
02:23:30,130 --> 02:23:32,540
self and the way they own,
they behave. It's total that

2518
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:35,720
I was more mad at myself and
I let that guy sidetrack.

2519
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:40,380
But it's good for you. Ultimately
it's good for you. It is really,

2520
02:23:40,381 --> 02:23:42,490
you learn from that shit cause
then you're like, why? Yeah,

2521
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:46,710
fucking why did that trigger that in me?
I just wanted, I just wanted to kill him.

2522
02:23:46,770 --> 02:23:49,840
The worst is when they come up with your
herbs helping you out up there. Oh yeah.

2523
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:55,080
I'll bring you out. Would you show up? But
I brought you been heckled a lot, right?

2524
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:59,450
You get heckled, don't, yeah. No, no, not
really. I've seen you get gold. All right.

2525
02:23:59,550 --> 02:24:02,910
Do you not remember? No, it was a lot of
weird. No, I mean not nothing bad. Like,

2526
02:24:02,911 --> 02:24:05,270
maybe somebody will yell something
out, but nothing like, uh,

2527
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:07,680
like where they keep on going
the whole time. You know,

2528
02:24:07,681 --> 02:24:09,560
where it's like a real
heckle back and forth. What

2529
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:13,810
difference do you find in doing my shows
as opposed to doing just random shows

2530
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,940
on the road.
Your shows are just fine.

2531
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:21,530
Like cause they know me and that that
completely is awesome because they,

2532
02:24:21,550 --> 02:24:24,520
they already know my sense of humor. So
yeah, they already know you. Silly person.

2533
02:24:24,550 --> 02:24:28,030
Yeah. So it's already easy for you just
to start. You're totally different, right?

2534
02:24:28,031 --> 02:24:29,050
Yeah.
Isn't that cool?

2535
02:24:29,140 --> 02:24:33,520
That's the best when you have your own
audience you guys are going to have it.

2536
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:36,910
Look, you know your, your podcasts,
podcasts is fucking hilarious.

2537
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:40,840
And folks who haven't heard it, it's
your mom's house and it's on death squad.

2538
02:24:40,990 --> 02:24:44,380
So if you go to iTunes and if you want
to look specifically for there is look

2539
02:24:44,381 --> 02:24:45,210
for the desktop,

2540
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:49,800
that squad ones that say your mom's
house and that's Tom and the lovely Mrs

2541
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:51,790
Segura and a favor.
We have a lot of,

2542
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,250
a lot of fun to do a man
we really enjoy doing it.

2543
02:24:54,370 --> 02:24:58,060
And we're going to put the Ice House one's
folks for everybody who's been asking.

2544
02:24:58,061 --> 02:25:00,880
That is also now going to
be on death squad. So a,

2545
02:25:00,881 --> 02:25:05,590
what it's called is the
icehouse chronicles and we
have a full studio set up in

2546
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:08,250
Pasadena and it is fucking dope.
And uh,

2547
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:12,520
Brian has been doing all of his podcasts
out of there now and yeah, it's awesome.

2548
02:25:12,521 --> 02:25:14,200
We're going to do one out
of there this Thursday.

2549
02:25:14,530 --> 02:25:15,940
I'm not sure who's going to do it yet,

2550
02:25:15,941 --> 02:25:17,710
but then we're going to have
a show there a Thursday night.

2551
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:22,420
So that should be a lot of fun in a
Thursday night show is a 10:00 PM show and

2552
02:25:22,421 --> 02:25:24,040
uh, it's uh, get tickets

2553
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,270
from the Ice House,
ice house,

2554
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:29,740
comedy.com and get them quick cause it
will sell out. It's only 85 seats. Uh,

2555
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:31,930
we did it last week and it's sold
out and it was fucking awesome.

2556
02:25:31,931 --> 02:25:34,240
And then crowd is cool and shit,
man,

2557
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:37,960
this podcast fans are awesome.
This is the greatest,

2558
02:25:37,961 --> 02:25:40,750
smartest thing I've ever done.
And it totally happened by accident.

2559
02:25:40,780 --> 02:25:44,320
Can I ask your fans to come see me?
Where are you this week?

2560
02:25:44,321 --> 02:25:47,350
I'm going to be at the comedy mixed
in the great city of Vancouver

2561
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:51,760
Saturday at the comedy
mixed on Bernard Street.

2562
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:55,540
It's one of my favorites that
I play is down. That is, yeah,

2563
02:25:55,570 --> 02:26:00,420
that is the old Yuk Yuk Yuk
Yuks in Vancouver. Oh, it's the,

2564
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:04,090
it's one of the best set
up rooms in the country.

2565
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:05,260
Or I shouldn't say in the country,

2566
02:26:05,261 --> 02:26:08,830
cause Canada and not just the country
in North America. North America.

2567
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:12,610
It's a perfect setup. It's
low ceilings, tight seeding,

2568
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:17,050
great place. Nice crowd,
great owner, nice guy.

2569
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:20,710
Nice people that work there. It's great.
Yeah. Tommy and I did it last time.

2570
02:26:20,711 --> 02:26:23,470
We did it. We did a theater on fraud. What
did we do on Friday night where we go,

2571
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:26,350
uh, I forget the name of good here and
we did a theater on Friday night and then

2572
02:26:26,351 --> 02:26:30,220
Saturday night we, after the fights we
went nuts it anymore. Is that right?

2573
02:26:30,221 --> 02:26:33,340
I don't remember. And then after the
fights we went and did, it might've been,

2574
02:26:33,570 --> 02:26:36,610
and after the fights who went and did
the comedy Max? It's fucking great.

2575
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:38,440
What a great little club and I started,

2576
02:26:38,441 --> 02:26:40,930
it used to be Yuck Arcs we did as
young Alex back in the day. Right. You,

2577
02:26:40,931 --> 02:26:43,420
me and who else? Who helped
did it with us? Yoshi. Yoshi.

2578
02:26:43,421 --> 02:26:47,350
Did it going to be on the show Thursday
and Thursday night? Yeah, I did it once.

2579
02:26:47,351 --> 02:26:51,430
It's got to do more shows
with Yoshi. Yeah, I like
Yoshi. Alight. He's hilarious.

2580
02:26:51,431 --> 02:26:55,420
He's friends with Asa, Akira. This girl
that we had on that podcast yesterday,

2581
02:26:55,421 --> 02:26:59,710
by the way, have you guys watched
a porn video on your TV recently?

2582
02:26:59,711 --> 02:27:03,070
Like an HD,
like it's completely disgusting

2583
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:08,520
watching the hardcore open
up your ass hole punch.

2584
02:27:09,150 --> 02:27:11,230
I have a watch porn on it inside of these

2585
02:27:13,660 --> 02:27:15,600
terrible things for aggressive shit.

2586
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:20,610
There's lot of spitting
and you're watching,

2587
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:23,710
you're watching the race you're
watching right now. This guy was,

2588
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:29,160
he had like equal clause and he
was proud of [inaudible] vagina.

2589
02:27:29,201 --> 02:27:32,780
I don't like that.
Hold the club.

2590
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:39,970
I'm also not like, I mean I like watching
an aggressively done blowjob. Sure.

2591
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:43,140
But when, well to a certain extent,
but when it gets into like, wow,

2592
02:27:43,141 --> 02:27:46,240
I'm getting like stuff that shit.
I don't like it aggressive at all.

2593
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:50,960
I don't like confusing sex with rape.
I don't know. I don't mean violent.

2594
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:55,900
Very, very in touch with
my chimpanzee instincts.

2595
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:59,740
And I think there's probably some dark
reason why men are so much fucking

2596
02:27:59,741 --> 02:28:03,040
stronger than women and their hot probably
has a lot to do with nature wanting

2597
02:28:03,041 --> 02:28:06,140
us to hold you down and fuck the shit
out of you sometimes. Sometimes you,

2598
02:28:06,460 --> 02:28:09,340
sometimes you fight back and we
have to club you. Yeah. So I don't,

2599
02:28:09,430 --> 02:28:14,430
I don't want to ever happen to that
fucking primordial pool of being via the

2600
02:28:15,161 --> 02:28:18,780
aggressiveness coming from the girl.
I don't mean like a throat match

2601
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:23,480
you,
that's fun to watch for a little bit.

2602
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:28,240
And then when they go like they puke.
Yes. Dummy file on cock, isn't it?

2603
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:30,830
I'm not gonna lie. I don't
like it. That aggressive

2604
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:34,940
love Bella, Donna, because
she's very pro. Like I just,

2605
02:28:34,941 --> 02:28:36,830
I like her energy and
I like her as a person.

2606
02:28:36,831 --> 02:28:41,300
I got to meet her at Sam Tripoli's naughty
show, but when she puts a baseball bat

2607
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:46,020
up her ass and not,
not the thin and the other.

2608
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:50,460
And at the end you hold off on,
forget who sent me that.

2609
02:28:50,490 --> 02:28:52,800
I think it might've been Dunkin,
it was a long time ago.

2610
02:28:52,801 --> 02:28:56,760
Someone sent me that video and a,
the heading just said batter up.

2611
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,100
And so I open the email,
you know,

2612
02:28:59,101 --> 02:29:00,930
it's one of those things where
someone just sends you of the email.

2613
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:05,010
I opened the email and then she said,
I love people. Exclamation point,

2614
02:29:05,011 --> 02:29:06,270
exclamation point,
exclamation point.

2615
02:29:06,450 --> 02:29:08,280
And then this link and
I clicked the link in.

2616
02:29:08,281 --> 02:29:12,600
This girl has a bad up her ass joyfully
glow. I was like, well fuck man,

2617
02:29:12,601 --> 02:29:15,210
someone finally did the last
thing that there is to do.

2618
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:18,420
And then I thought about it. I'm like,
wow, I wonder how long it took to do this.

2619
02:29:18,510 --> 02:29:19,980
And then I said, well, how
many people have done this?

2620
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:25,070
So then I googled baseball bat up the
ass and there's like fucking twenty eight

2621
02:29:26,490 --> 02:29:27,330
thousand two hundred and eighty
four million fucking mean.

2622
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:30,810
Who knows how many goddamn results there
were. But there was, it was ridiculous.

2623
02:29:30,811 --> 02:29:33,060
It's like there's a whole genre of porn.

2624
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:37,400
Girls stick baseball bats up each other's
asses. Now. She didn't do it for it.

2625
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:41,460
They can't help but take it
to the darkest level possible.

2626
02:29:41,650 --> 02:29:45,720
Can you say that home had doubled, did
doubling, doubling imaginary joking.

2627
02:29:45,721 --> 02:29:47,500
In the interview I said
something about double badge,

2628
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:50,910
which is Trey Parker and Matt stone,
his band.

2629
02:29:50,911 --> 02:29:52,080
That's why I always say it as a joke.

2630
02:29:52,081 --> 02:29:54,350
I didn't think people actually
signed it and she goes, oh yeah,

2631
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:59,600
a giant that were really like the center
point of a kaleidoscope of male bodies,

2632
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:03,290
male bodies,
and then to Cox in her vagina and to

2633
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:08,310
do that physically,
physically stand.

2634
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:13,170
How does everybody find a good spot to
stand for Asians? That's not even good.

2635
02:30:13,171 --> 02:30:16,260
They'd have to be like, they would have
to be like Cirque de Solei dancers.

2636
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:19,380
There's video that she's in note
like really good every time.

2637
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:21,870
Who are we talking about?
Belladonnas I'll say Kira.

2638
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:25,590
Every video she went to or
every person she went to,

2639
02:30:25,591 --> 02:30:26,430
it just got bigger and bigger.

2640
02:30:26,431 --> 02:30:31,431
She was fucking his black dude where his
dick seriously was about the size and

2641
02:30:31,501 --> 02:30:33,150
from my knee cap to my foot,

2642
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:37,590
like an inch thick that thick and
she's just fucking any ass with that.

2643
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:42,990
It just slips right in and an
ADP and it's fucking great.

2644
02:30:42,991 --> 02:30:47,680
I put it on 3d and didn't help
anything is that they hurry,

2645
02:30:48,910 --> 02:30:52,680
hurry, get busy with it.
Yeah. It's like are you ready

2646
02:30:54,970 --> 02:30:57,770
gen?
No.

2647
02:30:57,940 --> 02:31:00,400
Like gentle slow.

2648
02:31:00,510 --> 02:31:03,420
Well you know what it is because you
know obviously there's some editing,

2649
02:31:03,421 --> 02:31:06,210
some professional editing where they're
giving you is only the most extreme

2650
02:31:06,211 --> 02:31:09,720
aspect of the fantasy but does a lot of
it of all men abusing the women. Yeah.

2651
02:31:09,721 --> 02:31:12,480
This guy who was dragging her
from one part of the house,

2652
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:15,840
the other party house by her hair so you
would like choke her and I was stomach

2653
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:18,000
bile foam and stuff like that.

2654
02:31:18,001 --> 02:31:20,160
Then he would have just
dragged across into the other

2655
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,730
room by her hair and throw in the ground
and then shove his hand in her pussy so

2656
02:31:23,731 --> 02:31:24,300
hard.

2657
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:29,300
It was just juicing everywhere and they
would smack her and she bit him in the

2658
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:34,410
hand at one point and he drew blood
and he's like, look what you did to me,

2659
02:31:34,411 --> 02:31:38,010
take this. And then he just put
his big cock and Hazmat is crazy.

2660
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:44,280
The incidence of rape
has gone down with this

2661
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:49,270
Japanese philosophy.
I don't know if it's true.

2662
02:31:49,271 --> 02:31:51,280
I don't know if it's makes sense.
Look,

2663
02:31:51,281 --> 02:31:56,281
I think sexual suppression is responsible
and then also the lack of xpression is

2664
02:31:56,861 --> 02:31:59,680
responsible for a lot of things that
people do where they act out and do

2665
02:31:59,681 --> 02:32:00,550
something fucked up.

2666
02:32:00,850 --> 02:32:03,340
But then are how many people are going
to be inspired by these videos to

2667
02:32:03,341 --> 02:32:07,770
actually do it, to get the ultimate thrill
and do it in real life. I don't know.

2668
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:11,850
Do you guys ever switch it up in
the bedroom? Like Tom Dresses up

2669
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:16,110
the woman and you dress up as the
guy, he'll whatever, whatever.

2670
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:19,100
Here's the shoes with the heels

2671
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:26,030
I put on her Wednesday, I go, well
let me ask you this time cause you're,

2672
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,240
yeah,

2673
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,200
you're a big sports fan.

2674
02:32:28,201 --> 02:32:30,480
What do you think about the whole
Oscar de la Hoya getting caught wearing

2675
02:32:30,481 --> 02:32:33,420
women's clothes where you just
know it just really admitted it.

2676
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:34,620
He caught caught a long time.

2677
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:38,250
I caught a while and he said it was
all Photoshop nonsense but he recently

2678
02:32:38,251 --> 02:32:41,730
admitted it because he said it's been
haunting him and apparently like this

2679
02:32:41,731 --> 02:32:42,670
other grant on him out,

2680
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:45,330
another girl had just came out and did
an interview and said that this was like

2681
02:32:45,331 --> 02:32:48,000
he would do, he would corner everybody
wouldn't let the girls leave,

2682
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:51,210
like intimidate them and he'd be like
wearing girls clothes and hang out with

2683
02:32:51,211 --> 02:32:53,130
them and talking like a girl.
I think.

2684
02:32:53,131 --> 02:32:57,090
I mean I totally buy it and I mean I think
it's quirky but I think you know when

2685
02:32:57,091 --> 02:32:59,370
you hear like a story
about somebody and you're,

2686
02:32:59,430 --> 02:33:03,060
your brain always does the assessment of
like, can I see this person doing that?

2687
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:06,450
When I heard that initially about
Oscar de la Hoya, I was like,

2688
02:33:06,550 --> 02:33:10,260
you get over the like the what? What?
What's the story? And then I was like, oh,

2689
02:33:10,261 --> 02:33:13,320
I could see that. I can, I
could see that. Like you said,

2690
02:33:13,380 --> 02:33:14,670
like Bernard Hopkins did it.

2691
02:33:14,671 --> 02:33:19,410
I'd be like not ever was a cross dresser
and he was sure j Edgar Hoover was,

2692
02:33:20,630 --> 02:33:23,640
my understanding of cross dressing is
that it is not necessarily related to

2693
02:33:23,641 --> 02:33:25,830
homosexuality.
That doesn't make any sense to me.

2694
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:27,660
Seems Pretty Queer from where I'm sitting.

2695
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:32,620
It might be a different flavor of queer.
I might not be your standard genetic.

2696
02:33:32,621 --> 02:33:33,700
I was born gay,

2697
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:38,490
queer, but it's still, I think, I think
it leads to something to it. Yeah.

2698
02:33:38,491 --> 02:33:41,310
There's some on and I respect
him. I look, I'm, by the way,

2699
02:33:41,311 --> 02:33:44,490
I have zero problem with any kink that
you have, right. If you want to wear,

2700
02:33:44,491 --> 02:33:47,340
I'm not criticizing him going anyway.
I don't want to get confused.

2701
02:33:47,341 --> 02:33:49,710
I respect that guy. I think he's
a great fighter, is great fun,

2702
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:52,090
interesting guy and a very
brilliant businessman.

2703
02:33:52,091 --> 02:33:55,140
And if he wants to wear dresses, I think
he's wore dresses. I don't give a fuck.

2704
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:59,820
You know, it's just weird. I
say that what it is to just fun.

2705
02:34:00,270 --> 02:34:03,610
He is fun. Guys like him. I
think he, um, uh, I think,

2706
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:08,910
I think if he were to, I don't know if
he's from here. He's still like, he uh,

2707
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:10,890
if you were promote fights in address,

2708
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:16,980
that would be, well, there's
a Japanese, I would go watch,

2709
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:18,010
I forget

2710
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:18,611
the guy's name.

2711
02:34:18,611 --> 02:34:21,320
I'll look it up real quick because I
don't want to end this on a bad note.

2712
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:25,020
There's a Japanese kickboxer
that's a crossdresser all man.

2713
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:29,770
Oh yeah. He comes into the, well, he
comes, it's part of his walk in entrance.

2714
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:31,490
He comes in to the,

2715
02:34:31,770 --> 02:34:36,280
it comes into the ring with the fucking
wig on and pigtails and dressed up like

2716
02:34:36,281 --> 02:34:40,390
a school girl. The fuck out
of people. I mean, he's a,

2717
02:34:40,391 --> 02:34:41,980
he's a bad ass kickboxer

2718
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:48,050
and a tech scene that's different guys.
We don't, we don't really, you know,

2719
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:50,020
it's like sort of cross dressing.

2720
02:34:50,021 --> 02:34:55,021
If I dress like a guys that aren't at
the most straight men don't have any

2721
02:34:56,351 --> 02:35:00,970
desire to wear a dress kilt.
Let your balls loose a little bit.

2722
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,960
That's about as far as
it goes, right? Yeah.

2723
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,220
I mean there's more utility
in me wearing pants. Yeah.

2724
02:35:06,230 --> 02:35:10,930
Then guys wearing a girl's Thong
before? No, it's really pointless.

2725
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:12,120
Why did you wear a song?

2726
02:35:13,150 --> 02:35:15,730
I spent the night at the girlfriend's
house recently and I didn't have any

2727
02:35:15,731 --> 02:35:19,750
underwear and I think given her own
words, she's like, I only have thongs.

2728
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:22,980
And I'm like, so I tried it.
It's pretty much pointless. Why?

2729
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:27,600
Why do you even bother? Because
you're like, I need underwear. Right.

2730
02:35:27,610 --> 02:35:28,960
As long as the only thing around stupid.

2731
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:33,880
What's your asshole bacteria on your
vagina to Euston facts in that way?

2732
02:35:34,470 --> 02:35:37,690
Yeah. You got to get some full
back cotton breathers like mommy,

2733
02:35:37,691 --> 02:35:41,470
where's you know that you are not supposed
to move your Dick from the dictum?

2734
02:35:42,650 --> 02:35:43,710
I didn't have for a while.

2735
02:35:43,730 --> 02:35:48,730
[inaudible] you know little girls,

2736
02:35:52,721 --> 02:35:53,710
I'm a little young.

2737
02:35:53,711 --> 02:35:57,910
Girls are oftentimes get sick because
they wiped their ass and correctly cause

2738
02:35:57,911 --> 02:35:59,380
they wiped their ass into their vagina.

2739
02:35:59,381 --> 02:36:02,590
You've got to teach them to wipe their
ass the wrong way or they can get septic.

2740
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:05,800
It's fucking dangerous, man. It's
like you can get really sick,

2741
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:10,270
like real bad and that's how sickening
get from going butthole to vagina. Yeah.

2742
02:36:10,271 --> 02:36:14,350
I never really had to deal with that. I
guess until recently. You in your mouth,

2743
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:19,240
Huh? You get shit on your balls
standing up with one leg on the

2744
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:24,550
front to back. Yeah. He likes his balls.

2745
02:36:24,610 --> 02:36:29,300
A shitty sort of a [inaudible] side
hurts less to the other side. Last,

2746
02:36:29,470 --> 02:36:31,720
what do you mean he abuses his ass hole?
Yeah,

2747
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:36,880
he uses plugs a lot while
we're searching. Also, David,

2748
02:36:36,881 --> 02:36:41,830
tell him to my brother paper towels a
lot to wipe you do not flush that shit.

2749
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:43,780
That will, that will destroy
your whole entire plumbing.

2750
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:47,920
Nagashima that's the dude. The
dude, his name was Nagashima.

2751
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:53,160
Nagashima is the Japanese gentleman who
dresses up like a girl and even in this,

2752
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:56,170
look at this. Check this out. What
does he take a look at? This? Yeah,

2753
02:36:56,171 --> 02:36:58,150
he's a bad ass and knocked out Shinya Oak.

2754
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:00,340
He's one of the best
MMA guys in the world.

2755
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:03,550
This is him with a wig
on dress like a girl.

2756
02:37:04,510 --> 02:37:06,950
This one's a blonde one.
He wears deadlines all the time.

2757
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:13,990
Shima voicemail. Oh Dude,
he's a, he destroyed Shinier.

2758
02:37:14,090 --> 02:37:16,130
The end of the ring that like cause yeah.
Yeah.

2759
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:18,170
That's how he's looking. Here's another
one of him. Look at this this way.

2760
02:37:18,190 --> 02:37:21,530
It's got a blue wig on and is dressed
like a girl. I love the Japanese

2761
02:37:23,610 --> 02:37:28,490
and he beats the fuck out of people.
In your opinion,

2762
02:37:28,491 --> 02:37:33,180
is that like he's gay? This is like I'm
taking my gay rage to the ring. I mean,

2763
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:35,870
I don't know for sure.
There's been some gay fighters,

2764
02:37:35,871 --> 02:37:40,410
but the no one's ever come out and he's
that guy. No, no. He might not be gay.

2765
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:44,750
Might just be just for
fun. Boxers, MMA fighters.

2766
02:37:44,970 --> 02:37:49,400
Am I gay boxers as well? And Bill
Griffith is a famous, a famous by the way,

2767
02:37:49,401 --> 02:37:51,320
champion. And He, uh, he, uh,

2768
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:53,990
there was a guy who taunted
him and the guy wound up dying.

2769
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:56,180
Bernie and [inaudible],
I think the guy's name was Brittany paret.

2770
02:37:56,210 --> 02:37:59,060
I forget the guy's name,
but he killed him in a fight in,

2771
02:37:59,061 --> 02:38:01,130
I believe it was in New York,
in a boxing match.

2772
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:05,000
And the guy had taunted him for being gay.
Yeah. There's, you know, there's some,

2773
02:38:05,910 --> 02:38:08,380
yeah,
there's gay.

2774
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:14,360
That's not smart that somebody
told me about a show in New York.

2775
02:38:14,361 --> 02:38:18,320
I forget at what club were one of the
comics was making like, I don't know,

2776
02:38:18,321 --> 02:38:18,921
gay jokes,

2777
02:38:18,921 --> 02:38:22,850
but like doing just like you know like
gay slurs and I don't know what he was

2778
02:38:22,851 --> 02:38:27,560
saying and there was a big like jacked
up dude and the audience who just came

2779
02:38:27,561 --> 02:38:32,561
onstage and just punched him like twice
knocked about Jesus Christ about comics

2780
02:38:33,710 --> 02:38:37,330
is that we don't become
serial killers or pedophiles.

2781
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:39,440
What about that rapist?
That was the,

2782
02:38:39,730 --> 02:38:44,000
the one guy was the cruise liner guy who
would go to colleges and shit and rape

2783
02:38:44,001 --> 02:38:48,740
girls. Asked him to pray for him who was
raped them and ask them to pray for him.

2784
02:38:49,230 --> 02:38:53,690
Yeah. Meal Griffith was widely known
as being a gay man and there were the,

2785
02:38:53,750 --> 02:38:54,680
he had a fight with this guy,

2786
02:38:54,681 --> 02:38:58,730
Benny Perrey in 1962 for the welterweight
championship and the guy had taunted

2787
02:38:58,731 --> 02:39:01,740
him about being gay and he'd
beat them to death. Jesus.

2788
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:06,400
He'd beat that fucking guy to death
other than that. But other than that,

2789
02:39:06,401 --> 02:39:09,890
there's a few and far between people.
People have been recognized as being gay.

2790
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:14,240
We told the story on the podcast about
this one guy who got caught in an MMA

2791
02:39:14,241 --> 02:39:15,021
promotion.
Well,

2792
02:39:15,021 --> 02:39:18,440
there isn't another guy who was a
out guy who fights in MMA fights.

2793
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:22,080
I forget his name right now. It escapes
me. Shane, Shane Smith I think. Um,

2794
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:23,710
but he's out.
Like they've done stories about him,

2795
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:28,580
The New York Times and Chad Smith,
that's his name. And um, this other guy,

2796
02:39:28,850 --> 02:39:31,700
they caught him because they researched
his name and they found out that another

2797
02:39:31,701 --> 02:39:35,130
guy with the same name and done a bunch
of gay porns and then he just vanished.

2798
02:39:35,131 --> 02:39:39,140
She just disappeared. Stop fighting.
But other than that, no one is there,

2799
02:39:39,190 --> 02:39:41,600
but no one's ever come out there up.

2800
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:47,000
Chad Smith character for a lot of
people. Do they tap into, yeah,

2801
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:49,220
for a lot of people it'd be a big deal.
Does it happen?

2802
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,440
Does that mean instead of tapping out,

2803
02:39:53,740 --> 02:39:58,220
oh, Brian, you silly goose.
And with that note, Oh,

2804
02:39:58,221 --> 02:40:02,640
I want to say thank you to Lorenzo
from the psychedelic salon podcast.

2805
02:40:03,230 --> 02:40:07,800

podcasts. I listened to the
desk squad. I listened to a,

and then the naughty show
and all these different ones.

2810
02:40:17,911 --> 02:40:20,400

make your marriage a lot easier.

You don't have to. That's
true. You can kiss each other.

2833
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,520
You could fucking bang right
before you go on the street.

2834
02:41:42,290 --> 02:41:46,310
You just shoot one into her and stage.
Send her up on stage dripping.

How about that? Oh yeah.

2836
02:41:50,511 --> 02:41:53,040
You should launch her onto
the stage with your call

2837
02:41:54,710 --> 02:41:58,810
and I could put, I could put DMT

consonants jammed up together in some

2859

strange soup of words that no one can.
I bet you can't even spell your name.
