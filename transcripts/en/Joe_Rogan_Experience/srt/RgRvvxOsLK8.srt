00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,223
Satisfying.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,890
I was in Vegas and I was sober and I ran
into this chick that I know you used to

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,360
be a ring card girl and she was super,

5
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,200
super drunk.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,873
Sloppy.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,430
You're sober and so when else is not,

8
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:14,701
and you're like,

9
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,210
hey,

10
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,870
how are you doing?

11
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,703
How are you?

12
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,510
And they just like,

13
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,050
oh yeah.

14
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,943
By the way,

15
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,580
if you see people outside of a
pink Floyd concert that you know,

16
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,400
please don't assume
that they're just fine.

17
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,510
You know?

18
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:27,920
Don't just say,

19
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,311
hey man,

20
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:29,100
I haven't seen you in awhile.

21
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,870
Just fucking say hi and walk away.

22
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,763
Fuck Golan.

23
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,190
Yeah,

24
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,820
no,

25
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,630
please.

26
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,360
What happened?

27
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,400
Which was people saying hi,

28
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:35,731
but it's like,

29
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:35,971
I don't,

30
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:37,050
I can't talk to you right now.

31
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,280
Going to be cool.

32
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,060
I thought you ran into somebody they know.

33
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,600
Fucking hippie.

34
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,240
Yeah.

35
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,730
It's a very embarrassing thing when
you're intoxicated and the other person

36
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:45,300
isn't.

37
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,721
Yeah.

38
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,471
You feel like it's a hassle.

39
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,340
It's such a loser.

40
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:49,080
Whether I'm drunk or whether I'm stoned,

41
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,010
I always feel like a real
idiot if I'm drunk or coked up,

42
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,790
I feel like an idiot.

43
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,030
Yeah.

44
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,900
If I'm stolen,

45
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,741
I feel baffled.

46
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:56,574
You have the person.

47
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,440
If it's two in the afternoon
and you ain't high,

48
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,290
go fuck yourself.

49
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,124
Go out on my face.

50
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,140
I want you around me like I want cancer,

51
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,730
my balls back and I'm saying you got to
come around here looking at me with Yo.

52
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,850
Fuck a wide eyes.

53
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,601
Pick up that.

54
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,890
You know how whenever
you I'm gonna Reform.

55
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:11,760
Go Fuck Yourself.

56
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,260
My morning starts at 5:30 AM either
you're there or your square and I'm saying

57
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,670
it's true.

58
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,040
That's my new signature on the row.

59
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:19,874
Good Board.

60
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,100
If it's two in the afternoon,

61
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:21,811
UAA high go.

62
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:22,201
Fuck you.

63
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,700
Fuck is a shame on you,

64
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:24,040
bitch.

65
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,873
You're slipping,

66
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,003
you're slipping.

67
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,661
You're escaping.

68
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,840
If you have a fucking date,

69
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,411
unless no,

70
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:29,490

71
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:29,581

72
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,090
no.

73
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,580
I want to give a shout out to the
American people out there that work.

74
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:34,560
They have to get piss test

75
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,330
I'm writing about that.

76
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm writing a bit about you guys.

77
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,700
I really do respect you guys.

78
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,571
I see people,

79
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:40,241
they come up to me,

80
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,990
it's so great to see you and
they like talk to me about weeds.

81
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:46,210
I asked him if you want to smoke and they
look at me with this pain of his soul.

82
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,180
Yeah,

83
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,360

84
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,220

Democrats that walk around all day.

00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:55,980

88
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:56,910
