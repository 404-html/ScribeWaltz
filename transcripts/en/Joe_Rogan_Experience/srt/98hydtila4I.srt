00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,020
Hello Freak bitches on the weekends,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,950
if I'm off the road,

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:09,270
I go to coffee places to sit and write
for hours and work on book manuscripts

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,710
and all by the small coffee like this
one and three and a half hours later I'll

5
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,430
leave and I just drop it in the trash
because it's still about three quarters

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,264
full,

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,700
so I don't drink a lot of
coffee in the wintertime.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,660
I'll drink a cup of tea in
the morning and have a cup,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,050
a part of a cup of coffee.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,430
I'll drink all of the tea.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,920
What,

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,990
what makes what?

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,300
What fuels you to be so prolific?

14
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,910
You know you're saying you write an
article a month for the La weekly was so

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,300
once a week.

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,330
A thousand words a week?

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,571
Yeah.

18
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,590
Which does not do that.

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,890
You write for rolling stone author
Australia once a month and then I write,

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,950
I try and write a thousand words a day
for myself and I have right now five

21
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,570
different books in various states of
completion and that's not some College Guy

22
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:50,490
Saying my manuscript,

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,170
these are,

24
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,130
they're done and I'm by day.

25
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,963
I edit,

26
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,231
I'm editing.

27
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:56,400
The next journal book,

28
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,980
Travel Book and then
at night I'm writing a,

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,480
another journal book and working on
one of two different music books.

30
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,570
I do a series of music books
called fanatic where I,

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,110
you know,

32
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,030
rare records and labels like music geek
stuff and so I work on those at night.

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,600
And you also host a radio show and I
have the weekly radio show I just filled

34
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:15,810
in.

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:15,991
Oh,

36
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,030
tomorrow in England and BBC radio six.

37
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,170
I'm filling in for iggy pop.

38
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,180
He took a vacation from his show,

39
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,330
so I filled in for him last
week and this week as well.

40
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,320
So I did those shows.

41
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,431
So I'm.

42
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:31,431
I'm always busy and so
stimulants would get in my way.

43
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:34,080
What powers me.

44
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:34,950
It's not money,

45
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,450
it's not ambition,

46
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,313
it's anger.

47
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,270
I'm one of those people.

48
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,960
I,

49
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,670
I wish there was a better way to say it,

50
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,550
but it's,

51
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,920
it's vengeance.

52
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,540
He laughed at me in high school,

53
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,230
man.

54
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,100
He said I was going to be
anything really like watch this,

55
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,191
like that.

56
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:53,010
Still pushing you in 56.

57
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:53,970
I hate to say it.

58
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,780
Oh yeah,

59
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,590
40,

60
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,280
40 years later.

61
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,581
Oh yeah.

62
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:57,180
All of it.

63
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,480
Like,

64
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,313
you know,

65
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,310
my dad,

66
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,521
you know,

67
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,780
he was a big money guy.

68
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,614
I'm like okay,

69
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,070
you love money so much watching me
outgrows you and your whole damn family to

70
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,570
combined and I don't,

71
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,700
I don't even care about it.

72
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:13,500
I just like achieving it and it's one
of the reasons when the agent goes,

73
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:13,831
okay,

74
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:15,090
five shows on one off.

75
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,361
I'm like,

76
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:15,661
oh no,

77
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,494
no man,

78
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:16,991
no,

79
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:17,120
no,

80
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,851
that's a day off.

81
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,960
You put a show in there.

82
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,100
Like why?

83
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,933
Because like,

84
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,870
screw that man,

85
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,180
watch me put two shows on that night.

86
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,530
What you think I can't.

87
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,383
I'm just,

88
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,091
like I said,

89
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,220
I set up adversarial relationships.

90
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,480
I'm not against you or anything.

91
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,020
I'm just saying like I have to
have something to push against.

92
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,530
Like a schedule that
is like the schedules,

93
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,440
like Godzilla.

94
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,950
Like you can't finish
this all like really man,

95
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:45,570
I'm going to serve you up and eat you
every day like a steak and I just have to

96
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,111
have that.

97
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,080
And so I'm getting back and it's A.

98
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,820
I think of all the people
I was in bands with,

99
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,690
I have to crush them.

100
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,850
Everyone grew up with,

101
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,530
I have to powderize them.

102
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,530
Why that's such a weird
motivation is it sucks immature.

103
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,120
It's like it's 11 year old sandbox.

104
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,103
Wow.

105
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,340
Like you're aware of it,

106
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,970
which makes it even stranger because
it's not something that you're just

107
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:11,950
operating under know it's controlling
you and you don't understand why I quite

108
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,784
enjoy it.

109
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,740
Yeah.

110
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,281
Like if I,

111
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:15,520
you know,

112
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,940
I,

113
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,780
I'm not an actor but I go for acting
parts on bike basically going in there and

114
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:20,860
winging it and I get,

115
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,630
you know,

116
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,000
I get to go up for like really big
parse this a little bit of trepidation

117
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,290
knowing I'm going in there.

118
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,040
But then I think like,

119
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,873
oh yeah,

120
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,163
Sony,

121
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,681
whatever,

122
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,280
man.

123
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,250
Line it up and almost
like run out of my car.

124
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,420
Like you know where you at Man?

125
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,280
And I'm not trying to impress you.

126
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,510
I'm a tough guy because I'm not.

127
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
I just need,

128
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,680
it just needs to be trying to
tell me I can't and I that informs

129
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,600
everything I do.

130
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,940
Like instead of just
dialing my radio show in,

131
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,280
I will work on that sucker
for like five hours.

132
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,900
It has to be all handpicked.

133
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,501
Know that song,

134
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,280
not that one,

135
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,960
this one,

136
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,290
and they make like three drafts of it.

137
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,124
It's intense.

138
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,750
It's one of the reasons why I live alone.

139
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,910
It's like I work all the time like,

140
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,570
hey,

141
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,880
come out on this week and
now it's 7:00 PM on a Friday.

142
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,210
I'm working like I'm not constant.

143
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,960
Yeah,

144
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,471
no,

145
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,670
I'm not fun to hang out with.

146
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,860
Do you vacation ever where you just chill?

147
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:14,740
I can't intellectually and existentially.

148
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:17,230
I can't understand the idea of a vacation.

149
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,920
I make a joke on stage and said I want
to come back 10 pounds lighter with an

150
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,910
internal parasite.

151
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,571
I,

152
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:27,130
I want to come back with a scar where
the spear kind of grazed me and eight

153
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:30,370
grade stories and a
dangerous insect in my bag.

154
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,460
I don't want to sit on the
beach and soak in the race.

155
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,390
I want to get sunburned by being
in the desert and you know,

156
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,440
figuring out how the sun
won't try and kill me by noon.

157
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
That's the Sahara.

158
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,280
And so that's how I go about it.

159
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,930
So part of your motivation is actually
the perception by other people,

160
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,773
what you're doing.

161
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,010
Like understanding that what
you're doing is so undeniable,

162
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,440
the volume that you're
putting out and the intensity,

163
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,341
the intensity,

164
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,360
so undeniable.

165
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,100
Like I'll show you motherfuckers.

166
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,250
Yeah,

167
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,060
absolutely.

168
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,451
Wow.

169
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,200
That's so weird.

170
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,430
Even with people who like me,

171
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:03,701
like,

172
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:04,511
Yay Henry's here.

173
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:04,691
I'm like,

174
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:04,901
yeah,

175
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:05,440
I'm here.

176
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,861
Check it out.

177
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,400
Pitch.

178
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,830
So here's a place you won't go.

179
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,910
And not that I have any
aggression towards these people.

180
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,744
I just,

181
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,020
I just want to burn brightly
and it's not about money.

182
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,520
It's not about I'm better than you
because I don't think I'm better than

183
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,354
anybody.

184
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,300
I just want to explode
as much as possible.

185
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,520
And I think to my audience,

186
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,080
it's to their benefit.

187
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,381
He's like,

188
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:32,020
that dude's gonna go out there to a place
I don't want to go and he's going to

189
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,800
come back with 10 grade photos and a
story about how we nearly lost his foot.

190
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,663
It's great.

191
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,320
And like put me in coach.

192
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,580
That's the game I want to play.

193
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,720
That's what I go for.
