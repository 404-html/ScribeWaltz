00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,830
Did you have amateur fights?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,590
Yeah,

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,920
I fought in the amateurs and dude,

5
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,350
there was a time when I thought,

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,251
you know,

7
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,440
and I think that's why I can,

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,113
you know,

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,100
deal with the fighters and I understand,

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,641
you know,

11
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,290
like dealing with the ultimate fighter,

12
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,990
there was a fucking time
in a day when there was,

13
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,600
the only fucking thing I
cared about was boxing.

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,150
That's why I literally walked out of that
place because I loved it so much that

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,720
that's all I fucking wanted to do.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,510
The problem is you go out
there and you start fucking,

17
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:36,700
you know that that's what I
wanted to do for a living.

18
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,900
And then the reality starts to
set in and I'll never forget,

19
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:42,640
I mean I've told this story before,

20
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:46,300
but I was in the gym one day and

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,900
there was this dude who
was a local fighter.

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,800
I don't say his name.

23
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,960
You would probably fucking
know him if I said his name.

24
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:53,651
I guarantee,

25
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:54,370
you know,

26
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,230
cause he was famous in the Boston area,

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,770
you know,

28
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,700
like a local guy.

29
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,570
And he came in one day and he was like,

30
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:03,670
he was in his early thirties.

31
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:05,500
He was like 31 or 32.

32
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,413
And uh,

33
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,500
he was fucked up.

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,640
You know,

35
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,750
he was punchy.

36
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,730
He fucking moping around,

37
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,990
kind of throwing fucked.

38
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,610
And I remember the day
that I looked at him,

39
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:15,881
I said,

40
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:16,714
fuck,

41
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,250
what if that happens to me?

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,550
And then the minute you fucking
start thinking like that,

43
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:22,721
you're,

44
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:22,961
you're,

45
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:23,261
you're,

46
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:24,430
you're not the real deal.

47
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:25,060
You're not,

48
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,940
no matter how much you think
you want it or you think you do.

49
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,160
It was the day I realized that I wasn't,

50
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,840
and it was fucking like,

51
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,674
wow.

52
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,820
So then you start going,

53
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:35,890
how the fuck am I going to
make a living doing this?

54
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,070
And me and this dude,

55
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:42,160
Peter Welsh from Boston started,

56
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,710
uh,

57
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,030
you know,

58
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,410
teaching people how to box
basically businessman and stuff.

59
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,770
Cause the,

60
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,500
the business model wasn't,

61
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,880
if for instance,

62
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:52,720
like martial arts,

63
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,730
if you want to take a martial arts class,

64
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,940
it's fucking 50 martial arts
studios anywhere in any city,

65
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,871
anywhere in the world.

66
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,340
And it has been since I was a kid,

67
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,583
right?

68
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,260
And he lack of martial arts schools around
your place when you were growing up?

69
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,153
No.

70
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,330
So if you want to buy,

71
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,440
but if you want to box,

72
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:10,340
you got to go and fight.

73
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,870
You got to go get your
fucking head punched in.

74
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,041
You know what I mean?

75
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:13,370
You know,

76
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:13,851
especially,

77
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,050
you know the places in Boston,

78
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,790
you had the Somerville Boxing Club,

79
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,140
you had the fucking place down at the
mcdonough down in South Boston and the

80
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,540
and,

81
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,373
and the,

82
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,690
the Petronellis down in,

83
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,170
uh,

84
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,170
Brockton and,

85
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,540
and places like that.

86
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,640
And you went in and they would fucking,

87
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,230
you'd get your dick knocked loose,

88
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,200
right?

89
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,180
If you came back,

90
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,710
maybe they'd fucking work with you.

91
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,921
Well,

92
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:34,910
even guys had lights.

93
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:35,541
You would do that.

94
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,230
Like I got,

95
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,730
I got trained by Joe Lake and that's,

96
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,630
that's what he did with me.

97
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,920
He just stuck me in with guys,

98
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:40,581
you know that box.

99
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:41,414
And they all do.

100
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,800
They all do.

101
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,633
Yeah.

102
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,230
They do it quickly too.

103
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,070
Like we're right,

104
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,000
right from the beginning.

105
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,530
Find out how much you enjoyed doing this.

106
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,470
Do you really want to do it?

107
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,590
They a waste of my time
here to exact the right.

108
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,930
I'm going to teach you how to throw
some punches and then we're going to put

109
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:54,830
your head gear on.

110
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:57,890
Let me put your fuck of wrestling and
your face and then they can show me what

111
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:58,221
you got.

112
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,530
The first time they ever went in the box.

113
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,150
They had me do fucking ring circles.

114
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:04,690
You know what those are right where you
go laterally around the ring fucking

115
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,310
coming in every day they
have to ring circles,

116
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:06,791
ring circles,

117
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,271
rank circles,

118
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,104
ring circus,

119
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,651
and I was like,

120
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,484
what the fuck?

121
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,760
I paid my dues yet.

122
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,040
Paid my fucking eight bucks.

123
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,874
You know what I mean?

124
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,900
Oh,

125
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,070
I fucked you got mad one day.

126
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:15,904
I said,

127
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,500
I came here and learn how to fucking box,

128
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:17,621
man.

129
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,190
I've been running around in circles
for fucking weeks and he's like,

130
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:21,281
Oh,

131
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,360
you want to learn how to box right?

132
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,120
I fucking like fucking gear you up man.

133
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,751
Love.

134
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:30,580
Yet they throw you in there and
they beat the fuck outta you.

135
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,970
Fucking dropped me 50
times with body shots.

136
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,120
Punching my fucking head in
the worst of the body shots,

137
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,133
when you first started,

138
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,490
you started taking some body shots from
a guy who knows how to throw him and uh,

139
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:42,910
you know,

140
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,230
you're fucking lips are bleeding,

141
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,110
your nose is bleeding,

142
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,963
you're fucked up,

143
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,983
you get out,

144
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,530
you're completely morally destroyed.

145
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,513
You know what I mean?

146
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,990
Because boxing is never,

147
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,540
or sparring is never what
guys thinks it's gonna be.

148
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,380
You know,

149
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,790
your watch too many fucking movies.

150
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,790
You go in there and you think you're
going to spar and you get shit kicked out

151
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:00,941
of you.

152
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,774
But then,

153
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,680
you know,

154
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,220
I went home that night and I remember
laying in bed thinking the whole night,

155
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,620
fuck I got my ass whooped that slug,

156
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:08,801
this,

157
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,460
that,

158
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,530
and I went back to the gym
the next day and that was it.

159
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,140
Then you start working with you.

160
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,880
Very few people actually want to fight.

161
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,170
They just want to kick someone's ass.

162
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:17,831
It's true.

163
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:18,790
They don't understand that.

164
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,020
That kind of kick your ass too.

165
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,210
Like this is not going
to be an even exchange.

166
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,890
And if you're not willing to go to war,

167
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,850
if you're not willing to take like big
shots and be in pain and push through,

168
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,680
you're never going to do this.

169
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,341
This is you.

170
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:30,660
You,

171
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,090
you have to figure out somewhere along
the line whether or not you willing to

172
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:34,924
take punishment,

173
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,040
whether it's totally true,

174
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,040
punished by some guys can't.

175
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,890
So that was what our,

176
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,900
what our business was based on.

177
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:41,530
You know,

178
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:41,891
Peter,

179
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:42,340
I,

180
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,491
yeah,

181
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,324
you could come,

182
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,620
you could come into the real gym.

183
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,880
We're real fighters trained and you learn
how to box just like white collar box.

184
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:49,130
Yeah.

185
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,180
So it was like you learn how to box but
you didn't get your ass kicked every

186
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,300
day.

187
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,081
But some guys,

188
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:53,914
you know,

189
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,890
start trained for so long and get to
the level where they want to start

190
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:57,724
sparring.

191
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,170
But you rarely ever have white
collar guys that start sparring.

192
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,350
I want to do it a fucking again,

193
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,700
cause you know,

194
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,630
like I said,

195
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,210
you get that first ass whooping and uh,

196
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:07,851
and,

197
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,930
and a lot of times what happens is
it breaks and breaks out into fights,

198
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,130
you know.

199
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,561
And,

200
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,394
uh,

201
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,190
we,

202
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,760
we had,

203
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,593
we used to,

204
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,130
we used to bring the inner city kids into,

205
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,371
you know,

206
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,190
we had this idea what we're going to
bring in an inner city kids and you know,

207
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,590
in southeast back then it
was still very segregated.

208
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,830
So we are going to bring in blacks and
Hispanics and all these other kids and

209
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,300
bring them together and you know,

210
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,740
we're going to do all the fuck.

211
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,040
We used to bring these kids in man and
we started training them and stuff.

212
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,840
And then as soon as guys
would start sparring,

213
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,531
you know,

214
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,710
how many fucking situations we had were
guys would come back and with bats,

215
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,570
like there'd be a bad spar and deal come
back with bats or they'd come back with

216
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:47,260
their brothers or some kind of
just every fucking day there was.

217
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,393
So that whole,

218
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:48,971
you know,

219
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,190
let's bring in the inner city
kids and fucking tried to work.

220
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,300
It didn't go over well.

221
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,051
Yeah.

222
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:56,800
That's playing that experiment
and then work to us a lot of work.

223
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,250
It's interesting to see

224
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,970
the uh,

225
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,840
the attitude,

226
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,141
you know,

227
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,420
that used to exist back then,

228
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,270
the boxing gyms.

229
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,000
And now that people are,

230
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,050
we're,

231
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,740
we're seeing this evolution in mixed
martial arts where the beginning,

232
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,740
we saw a lot of like gym wars,

233
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,920
like that would be like a really normal
occurrence in gyms where guys would just

234
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,530
beat the fuck out of each other.

235
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:22,160
And you hear about Fido is getting
knocked out in the gym left and right and

236
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:22,994
left and right.

237
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,580
But now I think people are
starting to realize like,

238
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:25,701
Whoa,

239
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:25,851
Whoa,

240
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,001
whoa,

241
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:26,121
Whoa,

242
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:26,340
whoa.

243
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,040
There's no fucking benefit in this.

244
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,030
Like what's going on here?

245
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,660
But we're gonna,

246
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,890
we're looking at a gigantic multi,

247
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,331
multi,

248
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:36,380
multimillion dollar business and this is
how we're treating our commodities and

249
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,214
our prospects.

250
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:37,630
We're,

251
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,430
we're throwing them at each other
and let them blast each other.

252
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,950
And dudes getting punchy
way before their time.

253
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,170
And we both know Jim's work guys,

254
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,960
they get Chiney way too quick and you go,

255
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:48,351
well what?

256
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,350
How's this guy like?

257
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,320
This guy had an iron
changes three years ago.

258
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:51,561
Well,

259
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,970
it's taking fucking gym wars.

260
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,980
He's going through Jim
wars on a regular basis.

261
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,390
That was shoot the box.

262
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:56,961
That was the deal.

263
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,051
It,

264
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,870
shoot the box and shogun
himself said like we realized,

265
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:01,130
you know,

266
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,260
after doing that for a while
we can't do that anymore.

267
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,170
I know.

268
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,850
I that's how it wasn't boxing too though.

269
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:06,210
When I,

270
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,980
when I was involved in boxing some of the
best fights I ever saw her in the jet.

271
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,833
Oh yeah.

272
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,150
Oh hell yeah.

273
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,660
One day,

274
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,410
one day I saw uh,

275
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,803
uh,

276
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Livingstone bramble and Roger Mayweather.

277
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,510
Oh fucking go at it.

278
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,550
Oh I had a fucking gym in Vegas.

279
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,300
Yeah.

280
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,133
Another time.

281
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,960
Why one of the gyms cause
cause we all worked together.

282
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,490
I worked with Mayweather,

283
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,290
I worked with Nick one kick,

284
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,453
um,

285
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,350
Floyd when Floyd was first coming.

286
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,900
I mean we all worked
together in these gyms,

287
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,033
you know.

288
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,970
And uh,

289
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,670
one time there was this dude,

290
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:42,361
he was a heavyweight,

291
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,720
his name is Tracy and him and Roger May,

292
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:45,960
whether fucking got into it,

293
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,410
he was,

294
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,790
Tracy was a young heavyweight,

295
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,110
24 year old kid,

296
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:52,570
heavyweight and Roger was fucking one 47.

297
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:52,890
Yeah,

298
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,790
in his forties.

299
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,620
She's like,

300
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:56,860
what you say mother fucker?

301
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,530
Just sit down at the fucking gate into it,

302
00:07:58,531 --> 00:07:59,630
both the back and forth and go,

303
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:00,464
Oh shit.

304
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,291
Here we go.

305
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,970
And they got in the fucking
ring and start a fight,

306
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,973
man.

307
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,680
Yeah.

308
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,430
They started fucking fighting and at
the end of the round when the bell went

309
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:09,000
off,

310
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,420
Tracy tried to stop and Roger
fucking lit him up and he goes,

311
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,231
no rounds,

312
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,064
motherfucker,

313
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,503
no routes.

314
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,850
So they just kept fighting straight
fucking through until fucking Tracy quit.

315
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,330
Oh my God,

316
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,420
you're fucking whooped his
ass and he fucking quit.

317
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,710
And forties.

318
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:25,980
Yeah.

319
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,400
And then,

320
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,330
and then when he quit,

321
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,830
Roger hit him another eight,

322
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:30,900
nine times after he fucking quit.

323
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,850
And He,

324
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,820
and it was basically like,

325
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:34,650
don't have a fucking mouth off to me.

326
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:35,340
And this gym,

327
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,431
uh,

328
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,810
one 47 pound,

329
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:37,580
40 year old.

330
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,890
Yeah,

331
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,620
but Roger Mamba.

332
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,160
Yup.

333
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,590
You know,

334
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,880
a lot of people don't know Roger.

335
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:42,601
You know a lot of people,

336
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:43,680
everybody knows Floyd.

337
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:44,514
But Roger,

338
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,590
his uncle in his time,

339
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,060
he was a bad mother fucker.

340
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,830
He had a piston right hand.

341
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,480
Yep.

342
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,410
He had a nasty jab and he would
fucking slam that right hand in.

343
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,980
He was a bad dude

344
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,970
for many a year.

345
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,420
I've seen some crazy shit happen
in fucking gym boxing gyms,

346
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:00,960
man.

347
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,731
Crazy Shit,

348
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:01,860
huh?
