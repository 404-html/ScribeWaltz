1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,080
So tell me what the fuck
happened with Tracy Morgan.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,360
I'll preface this.

4
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:09,780
I want to be safe and prefaces that my
buddy Jay Moore does tell this on stage.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,591
We have an agreement.

6
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,161
He's my friend.

7
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:11,820
He's not a thief.

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,091
Okay.

9
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:12,331
That's,

10
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,164
I just want,

11
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,900
I know that Jay is concerned about that,

12
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,060
but he told me he's not
telling the story anymore.

13
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,420
And it did happen to me as long as,

14
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,420
I mean this is a true
story is a true story.

15
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,313
It's a true story.

16
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,590
So as a young comic working
in at the Boston Comedy Club,

17
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,850
we're in the door in New York,

18
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,700
in New York.

19
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:27,900
Yeah.

20
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,900
And I used to party with all the black
comics because they well cause you like

21
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:34,004
to yeah.

22
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,310
And so we uh,

23
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,250
we used to have a good time.

24
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,890
And so then one night
Tracy Morgan comes in,

25
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,930
this is when he starts to get
back into standup after SNL.

26
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,560
So like when you were young comic in a
new celebrity coming you like had to see

27
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:47,820
that shit had to,

28
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,910
so I go in and I watched
Tracy set and it is not,

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,290
we have nothing in common.

30
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,610
He's doing observational material and
his observational material is like,

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,680
oh right you okay?

32
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,550
Okay,

33
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,230
who remembers Vinca fucking bout a
handball courts and I'm just like,

34
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,560
and he thinks that's a shared experience
like losing a sock in the dryer,

35
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,310
right.

36
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,740
Everyone else.

37
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,110
And then he walks you
through and he's like,

38
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,770
you would put that bitch
up against the wall,

39
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,541
just pussy pop.

40
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,880
That bitch wouldn't even kiss.

41
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:17,400
So put your arm and your own stank and
now you have a visualization of like

42
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,280
precious getting boxed
out at a handball court,

43
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,720
making eye contact with passer by just
getting her Bootsy blown out by Tracy

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,553
Morgan.

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,830
He goes on stage and he's like,

46
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,220
fucking,

47
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,030
yeah,

48
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,930
I hit that man.

49
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,440
I've got this new bit about
my dick being so pretty.

50
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,800
Or you can soak it with the lights on,

51
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,160
which is a genius statement.

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,530
I never had a blowjob in the light,

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,200
but he just didn't word it right.

54
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,870
Right.

55
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,703
So

56
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,450
exactly what the lights are.

57
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,401
So he,

58
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:49,641
um,

59
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:51,290
so he goes,

60
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:51,831
he,

61
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:52,520
uh,

62
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,353
so then he goes,

63
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,451
oh,

64
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:54,231
you want to get hot?

65
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:54,741
And I was like,

66
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:55,170
yeah,

67
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,120
and because I'm a grown up and so we
walk around the corner and he pulls out

68
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,530
this rack of a joint hands.

69
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:01,190
It to me,

70
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,940
hits it,

71
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,661
that gives it to me.

72
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,430
I hit it and it tastes like shit.

73
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,810
It tastes like sweat socks.

74
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:06,500
Like just,

75
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,333
just like,

76
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,181
and I'm like,

77
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,290
what the fuck is this?

78
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,070
And he's like,

79
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,221
oh,

80
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,720
you never smoked a sherm before?

81
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,411
And I was like,

82
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:12,681
what?

83
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:12,921
He's like,

84
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:16,580
show or baby angel does PCB
you've never smoked shown before.

85
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,300
And I'm like,

86
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,710
you just given me fucking like,

87
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,340
how did you know who ever
taught you how to get high?

88
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,110
So I panicked.

89
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,681
Bad,

90
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,850
like hardcore anxiety attack.

91
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,713
I go back to the club,

92
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,360
I'd go to this older black
comic who's was and still is,

93
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,260
one of my good friends.

94
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,130
And I go,

95
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,580
hey man,

96
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,110
Tracy just gave me PCP.

97
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,010
He's like,

98
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,670
Oh,

99
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,030
oh,

100
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,631
let me tell you something.

101
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:36,464
Shawty.

102
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,910
Tracy done smoked PCP.

103
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,260
He's not fees fucking with you.

104
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:39,801
I was like,

105
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:40,310
when he's up,

106
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,780
he's going,

107
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,660
he's just smoking pot.

108
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,560
He's fucking with you though.

109
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:43,580
He's just getting in your head.

110
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,121
And I was like,

111
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:44,241
no,

112
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:44,841
he smoked PCP.

113
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:45,351
I'm feeling weird.

114
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:45,800
And he goes,

115
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,990
whatever you do shoty
don't go to your house.

116
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,190
You hang out with us tonight.

117
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,770
So I'm like,

118
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,360
all right.

119
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,141
So I'd do my set,

120
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:51,591
I bomb.

121
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:56,150
We all go out and Tracy
is in downtown Soho,

122
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,630
like debt,

123
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,171
right on house.

124
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,350
Tim Wright and he's in a club that,

125
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,020
it's like one of those railroad
clubs where it goes all the way back.

126
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,980
You have to like walk down five spice,

127
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,940
a flight of five stairs to
get to and he's in the back.

128
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,060
He's been there like 20 minutes and he
is holding court with his shirt off.

129
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,690
Okay.

130
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,523
Shirt off.

131
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,680
Bottles of champagne covering his table.

132
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,720
There's other tables that
have champagne on it.

133
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,680
He's buying it for them.

134
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,050
I buy her a bottle of champagne right now.

135
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,160
I've got a pretty Dick,

136
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,050
like just Eddie Murphy gave me this,

137
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,170
whatever the fuck you saying
is like loud and boisterous.

138
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,930
So I sit at the table and
I'm thinking I'm on PCP.

139
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,580
And I started ordering Heinikin separately
from this wreck of a bar tab he has.

140
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,550
And so I'm getting Heinekens and
then the whole night goes through,

141
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,690
it's kind of an interesting,

142
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,800
bizarre experience,

143
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,180
but like two o'clock
in the morning and uh,

144
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,340
Tracy and the waitress comes up and she's
got the bill and she puts it in front

145
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,920
of me cause I'm going to
table with all black dudes.

146
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,530
So she thinks on their
agent or lawyer or coach,

147
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,364
whatever I am.

148
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,260
So she gives me the bill
and I see it and I'm like,

149
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:53,741
oh,

150
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,191
I can't.

151
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,140
And Tracy Morgan flips out and he goes,

152
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,651
oh,

153
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,730
what the fuck is that?

154
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,230
That's fucking racism.

155
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,250
You give it to him.

156
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,840
He works the God damn dog.

157
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,450
He doesn't new.

158
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,690
I not make any money on the
rich mobile fucking here.

159
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,070
I'm on TV.

160
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,851
I'm the ritual,

161
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,241
the fuck.

162
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:10,570
And he flips the bottle of
champagne table upside down.

163
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,433
Now the woman's like,

164
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,140
I'm sir.

165
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,610
And he goes,

166
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:12,851
hey.

167
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,370
And he takes his shirt
and throws it in her face.

168
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,780
A bouncer comes up and he's like,

169
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,770
excuse me sir.

170
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,090
And Tracy just wham lays the guy in the
biggest fight I've ever been in just

171
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,230
breaks out all over.

172
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,220
People are fighting,

173
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:24,910
jumping on,

174
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,200
and I think I'm on PCP.

175
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,510
So I walk out on Houseton
and I start going,

176
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,344
this isn't happening.

177
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,131
This is the imaginary.

178
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,240
This is not real.

179
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,160
People are flooding out left and right.

180
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,731
And they're like,

181
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:33,971
dude,

182
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:34,930
that shit's going off trees.

183
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,890
He's got like four dudes on him.

184
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,551
And I was like,

185
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,384
Holy Shit.

186
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,100
A minute later the doors kicked open
and Tracy Morgan is launched out of the

187
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:46,280
club by the back of his neck and a seat
of his pants just up onto the street

188
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,901
shirt on him.

189
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,130
No up on the street,

190
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,800
shirtless laying at my
feet on the sidewalk.

191
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,730
Doors close.

192
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,050
Second later door's kicked back
open and Tracy's shirt comes out,

193
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:59,200
end over end and lands on
his head and it's silent.

194
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,070
And we're looking at Tracy like,

195
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:00,760
fuck,

196
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,541
this is crazy.

197
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,560
All of a sudden he looks up,

198
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,311
stands up,

199
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:03,851
takes his shirt,

200
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,231
snaps it,

201
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:04,690
and he goes,

202
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,430
now that's how you get
out of paying a check.

203
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,450
This guy's crazy.

204
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,410
Like a Fox.

205
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,860
He fucking to walk in a $6,000 part,

206
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,220
Shit kicked out of the park.

207
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,430
It really did that.

208
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:22,970
That's awesome.

209
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,803
That's awesome.

210
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:23,961
I mean,

211
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,340
did he ever have to pay for it whenever?

212
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,174
I have no idea.

213
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,660
I never,

214
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,040
I did.

215
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,501
Here's the thing,

216
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,220
I don't limit.

217
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,680
Only met Tracy wants that.

218
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,260
You don't hang out with
a dude more than that.

219
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,070
Oh,

220
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,930
I would never leave that guy side.

221
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,023
I would have to be

222
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,540
all the time.

223
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,613
I never knew.

224
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,763
I never knew how to start.

225
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,881
I don't hear anything.

226
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:14,040
Brian.
