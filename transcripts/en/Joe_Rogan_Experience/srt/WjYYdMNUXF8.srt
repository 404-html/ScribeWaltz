1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,720
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,823
two,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,630
all the way from Tucson,
Arizona.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,650
Dr.
Weil,

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,090
how are you sir?
I am good.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,560
Thanks for doing this man.
I appreciate it.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,423
Pleasure.
You come highly recommended by many 

8
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,820
human beings that I know well.
I'm glad to hear it.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,310
How do you.
How do you get such a fine reputation?

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,233
Well,
I've been doing the same things for a 

11
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,060
long time.
Just putting one foot ahead of the other

12
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:29,061
and saying what I know to be true and 
push and Macho Macho.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,830
Who doesn't like Matcha tea?
This is your stuff.

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,610
Yeah,
but you know,

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,443
a lot of people know,
have only tasted really bad much 

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,810
enlighten me what's know?
It's powdered tea and it's very,

17
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:44,811
very finely powdered and it's very labor
intensive to prepare and it's got such a

18
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,280
huge surface area that it oxidizes very 
quickly.

19
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,710
So if it's not properly packed and 
stored,

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,870
it loses its brilliant green color.

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,430
It turns yellow,
green or gray green.

22
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,430
It gets bitter and loses its taste.
And I got to say,

23
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,030
most of the macho that I see served in 
this country is of that sort.

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,890
And many people have never had the good 
stuff.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,860
What's the benefits of Macho?
I know there's.

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,870
First of all it's been.
It's beautiful.

27
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,760
I mean I've never seen a green color 
like that.

28
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,920
It's just amazing.
And the flavors are amazing,

29
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:15,630
but it's the only preparation of tea in 
which the whole leaf is consumed and it.

30
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,623
It's grown under special conditions.
The leaves are shaded a deep shade for 

31
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,210
the last three weeks before harvest.
So the in response to that,

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,030
the leaves produce more chlorophyll,
more antioxidants,

33
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:27,864
more the good stuff.
So it's got a much more of the things 

34
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,150
that you want.
And this has like a pop top,

35
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,160
like pringles.
Yeah.

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,993
Is that so the marches and it's got to 
stay fresh and fun and you want to keep 

37
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:43,611
it in the freezer and freezer and you 
can sift it so it doesn't form lumps.

38
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,084
And then you whisk it with that 
traditional bamboo whisk or you buy a 

39
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,480
little electric whisker and you can 
whisk it in hot water or cold water.

40
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,650
And it's very yummy.
And w what,

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,990
what does it do for you?
Like,

42
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,340
what's the good.
Well you've got,

43
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,670
it's got caffeine of course,
so you get stimulated by it,

44
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,504
but it's also got [inaudible],
which is this relax and compound that 

45
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:08,361
modifies the effect of caffeine and 
produces a state of relaxed alertness so

46
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:11,010
it doesn't have the jangling effective 
coffee.

47
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,263
And uh,
you're getting all of these antioxidant 

48
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:15,590
benefits that are well documented in 
tea.

49
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,291
Anyway.
I love it.

50
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
It's a great thing.
Anytime you get one of these little 

51
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,070
whisks,
it's cool.

52
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,800
It's like a real bamboo made from one 
piece of bamboo.

53
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:25,530
It's a miracle of a Japanese 
craftsmanship.

54
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,320
It's beautiful and it's beautiful.
So,

55
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,580
um,
how often do you drink this stuff?

56
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,040
I have a bowl of it every morning and 
yeah.

57
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,040
And sometimes I have a glass of iced 
macho later in the day,

58
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,110
especially in warm weather.
You just so much a fiend.

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,910
I love it.
It's a good thing.

60
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:42,810
I first tasted it when I was 17.
I was an exchange student in Japan.

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,801
Uh,
19,

62
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:46,650
59.
I lived with a family outside of Tokyo.

63
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:49,320
We had no language and come and on the 
second night I was there,

64
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,154
the mother took me next door to her 
neighbors who practice tea ceremony and 

65
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,444
they did this thing for me and I was 
fascinated by that whisk and the color 

66
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,650
of the Macho and I thought it was great.

67
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,483
You know,
I never thought I'd be able to get it 

68
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,740
over here.
Yeah.

69
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:03,520
Well,
so you,

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,190
you import this stuff yourself.
Was that.

71
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,780
I started a company called Mochi,
Kaare.

72
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:12,620
We've got the URL [inaudible] dot com 
and I went to Japan to Eg,

73
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,503
which is a little town outside of Kyoto,
which is the center of the best tea 

74
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,380
production in Japan.
And I sourced really good macho,

75
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,253
you know,
there are many grades and launch of the 

76
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,490
most,
the highest are too expensive to use for

77
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:26,560
everyday use.
They're really phenomenal.

78
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,394
Alex,
like truffles are really expensive so 

79
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,163
I've tried to find the best Macia that 
is affordable and make it available to 

80
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,980
people here.
So like the highest level stuff.

81
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:42,630
How much would it cost for a cup of tea?
Hard to estimate for a cop,

82
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,810
you know,
it possibly.

83
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,683
There's a preparation called thick tea 
in Japan where they use three times the 

84
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,500
amount of powder and probably one bowl 
of that stuff,

85
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,820
which is shared by several people.

86
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,830
I don't know.
It could be a $100 a bowl.

87
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,090
Whoa.
Really?

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,790
Yeah.
Why,

89
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,600
why did it catch on in Japan like that?
It's always been,

90
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,434
you know,
it has been in Japan for a very long 

91
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,661
time.
And,

92
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,494
and uh,
this powdered tea preparation was 

93
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,770
originally taken up by Zen monks,
uh,

94
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,220
to help them stay awake during long 
hours in meditation.

95
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,054
It was also associated with a Samurai 
and became the tea ceremony developed 

96
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,674
around that.
Is there anything that is similar to it 

97
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,580
is like your Vermont Tay or Guarana or 
any other time?

98
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,710
These are all,
they're all caffeine plants,

99
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,220
but in my experience,
t I think,

100
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:30,054
and it's primarily because of that Elle 
fanning content of the effect is 

101
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:36,400
mellower of caffeine.
So you get stimulated,

102
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,234
you get alert,
but it doesn't have the jangling 

103
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,600
effective a lot of these other caffeine 
beverages.

104
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,880
Do you drink regular coffee as well?

105
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,200
No,
I've never drunk coffee.

106
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,123
Wow.
I think I was turned off because my 

107
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,830
parents,
when I was growing up,

108
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,693
drank really strong black coffee with no
sugar cream and I couldn't imagine why 

109
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:55,240
people would savages and those people.
There were different people.

110
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,820
Did you grow up in a northern climate?
I grew up in Philadelphia.

111
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,660
When it's cold outside people they drink
that black coffee makes you angry.

112
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,930
Yeah.
Dark black,

113
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,510
burnt coffee.
I like bright green,

114
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,493
shining Russia.
Isn't it interesting that things that 

115
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,590
are good for you?
Many things that are good for you,

116
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,550
like bell peppers or something like 
that.

117
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,400
They have a beautiful color to,
well,

118
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,030
you know,
all these,

119
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:22,864
uh,
the health benefits of fruits and 

120
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:24,664
vegetables.
A lot of them have to do with these 

121
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:29,230
pigments and the pigments the plants 
produce,

122
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,800
they're part of their own defensive 
system and they do good things in us.

123
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,663
And one piece of advice that I often 
give people is you should try to eat 

124
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:37,444
across the color spectrum and every day 
about what did you eat today that was 

125
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,380
red?
What was purple,

126
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,430
what was green,
what was right.

127
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:47,290
All of these have different benefits.
Is that a scientific perspective?

128
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,530
Absolutely.
Yeah.

129
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,090
These are categories of phytochemicals 
are protective,

130
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,943
phyto nutrients and a lot of them are 
these pigments that give a fruits and 

131
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,010
vegetables that are bright colors.
Do you think that people

132
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,390
should very those colors and in a given 
day or.

133
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,790
I think as as much as you can across any
day,

134
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,090
try to eat across the color spectrum.
That's a good thing to aim for.

135
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
Okay.
So just just get as many of them as in 

136
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,050
as you can.
Yeah.

137
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,943
Yeah.
So do you take this approach with 

138
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,460
fruits,
with all sorts of different things?

139
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,590
Yeah,
brightly colored stuff is good.

140
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,513
Do you eat meat or fish and vegetables?
Just fish and vegetables now when you 

141
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,633
did.
One of the things I'm super concerned 

142
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,614
with and I've been more concerned with 
the more pay attention to it as 

143
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:31,850
sustainability when it comes to fish.
Absolutely.

144
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,713
It seems like especially ocean fish,
we're human beings are just terrible 

145
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,250
monsters.
You know,

146
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,470
there's a famous oceanographer in this 
country,

147
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,720
Sylvia Earl,
who was the woman that held a record for

148
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,554
the deep dive and she came up to me at a
meeting once and pleaded with me not to 

149
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,960
recommend that people eat fish.

150
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,793
He said there just aren't going to be 
any in the future and that's probably 

151
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:52,604
true.
Probably the future is going to be 

152
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,440
farmed fish and that can be done in a 
responsible way.

153
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,430
You can get the good guides,
one is put out by the Monterey Aquarium.

154
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,293
You can get a wallet card that lists 
that lists fish and shellfish and rates 

155
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,930
them both by toxicity and 
sustainability.

156
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,630
And that's a good guide to follow.
Yeah.

157
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,230
Um,
mollusks mollusks I eat,

158
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,850
I eat,
I like oysters and scallops.

159
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,530
I eat them.
What is,

160
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,970
what has led you to not eat chicken or 
fish or beef?

161
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,970
It's been a long time.
And uh,

162
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:27,951
let's see.
I was,

163
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:28,784
I think 28 and I was interested in Yoga 
and people that I knew who were doing 

164
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:34,934
yoga had become vegetarian and I saw 
friends of mine that had become 

165
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:38,570
vegetarian.
I thought,

166
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:39,404
well,
I'll just try it for a little while and 

167
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,114
it agreed with me,
I didn't eat fish for a number of years 

168
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,730
and I found that made the international 
travel very difficult,

169
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:47,840
especially to Japan.

170
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,973
And,
and then I was reading about all the 

171
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:50,744
research on good stuff and fishing.
I started eating fish and that way of 

172
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:56,480
eating Greens with me real well.
Yeah.

173
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:00,380
Um,
it is a thing that agree with you thing,

174
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,214
right?
It really dependent upon the person's 

175
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,920
very individually.
So,

176
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,080
you know,
it's hard to give blanket rules except I

177
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,570
have no problem telling people to stay 
away from refined,

178
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,210
processed and manufactured food.
That's the bad stuff.

179
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,560
Yeah.
That's a really good,

180
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,380
clear thing that everybody can kind of 
apply in their life.

181
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,360
But as far as like,
what is gonna work for you,

182
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,560
there's a lot of trial and error 
involved isn't absolutely.

183
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:21,800
You got to do experiments,
pay attention,

184
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,240
see what works for you.
Yeah.

185
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,250
Now you practice.
What would you,

186
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,420
how would you call it?
Integrative,

187
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,790
integrative medicine?
How would you define that?

188
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,290
Well,
it's medicine of the future and uh,

189
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,153
you know,
the short answer and the future short 

190
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:34,934
answer is that's the intelligent 
combination of conventional and 

191
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,990
alternative medicine,
but really it's,

192
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:39,824
it's a system that focuses on the body's
ability to heal itself that looks at 

193
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,740
people as whole persons,
not just physical bodies,

194
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,903
uh,
that takes account of all aspects of 

195
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,270
lifestyle and understanding health and 
illness,

196
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,383
a values the practitioner,
patient relationship and makes use of 

197
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,010
all therapies no matter where they come

198
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,843
from that show,
reasonable evidence of efficacy and are 

199
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,680
not going to hurt people.
So I am absolutely convinced this is the

200
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,514
way out of the healthcare crisis.
I've been training doctors and other 

201
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,380
health professionals in it for many 
years now.

202
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,753
Now,
when you say the body's ability to heal 

203
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,424
itself,
how would you accentuate that with this 

204
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:16,440
to me is the thing that's most missing 
from medical education?

205
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,483
Uh,
I,

206
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,373
I,
I think the only time I heard the word 

207
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,220
healing used in medical school was in 
the,

208
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,103
in wound healing,
which in my first year course in 

209
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:29,670
histology,
to me the most marvelous thing about our

210
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,860
bodies is that they have the capacity to
heal themselves.

211
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,170
You'd get a cut,
you can watch it heal,

212
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:38,160
and that happens throughout the body.
Knew the DNA molecule.

213
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,580
This is just a big molecule on the 
border of life and non life.

214
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,800
It has within it the ability to know in 
quotes when it's been injured,

215
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,840
have a cosmic ray,
knocks a part of it out.

216
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,990
Instantly it begins to manufacture,
repair enzymes that,

217
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,513
that duplicate the missing piece and 
paste it in and you can see that same 

218
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,740
thing at any level of biological 
organization.

219
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,260
And to me,
that's where good medicine should start,

220
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,770
that the body has within them the 
ability to maintain equilibrium,

221
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,980
heal itself.
Now knowing that the body has disability

222
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,780
of what?
What do you do to accentuate that?

223
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,320
Well,
if I,

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,400
when I listened to a patient and hear 
their story at the back of my mind,

225
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm thinking,
why is healing not happening here,

226
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:20,040
but what can I do from outside that can 
facilitate that?

227
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:20,874
I can't put it into somebody,
but I can help it along by either 

228
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,550
supplying energy,
missing materials,

229
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,900
remove obstacles to it.

230
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,790
You know,
like you have a wound that doesn't heal.

231
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:34,020
Maybe there's a foreign body in it.
You remove that heals now.

232
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,943
Um,
when you have people that come to that 

233
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,373
have issues like saved,
someone comes to and they have a back 

234
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,644
issue.
Yeah.

235
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,570
Got a little bit of lower back pain.
Do you approach that from a,

236
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,460
in terms of like how they're eating,
how they're living their lifestyle?

237
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,060
First I would question them about 
lifestyle for sure.

238
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:51,660
But,
uh,

239
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,540
you know,
I'm a great follower of a,

240
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,350
a man who died recently named John Sarno
who isn't,

241
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,850
you know,
veterans work.

242
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,820
Sure.
Uh,

243
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,750
he has some great books,
mind over back pain,

244
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,090
healing back pain.
And his main belief,

245
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:03,924
which I totally agree with,
is that the vast majority of back pain 

246
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,003
is muscle spasm,
which originates in the mind and it may 

247
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:14,040
localize that an area of physical 
injury,

248
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,770
but the injury is not the cause of it.

249
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,620
You can live with a slipped disc and 
have no pain.

250
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,883
Uh,
you look at x rays it defined slip 

251
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,124
though.
What does that mean,

252
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,940
bulging or herniated?
That does not necessarily close pain.

253
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:28,923
Uh,
and unless there's associated 

254
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:31,644
neurological symptoms,
you don't want to do anything about 

255
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,770
that.
It's unless it's pressing on.

256
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,623
Exactly right now I'm John Sarno.
His idea was that it's a lot of stress 

257
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,803
and anxiety and a lot of different 
psychological factors that I'm sure he 

258
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,114
was some kind of incredible healer.
He required the people who came to him 

259
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,890
come to to evening lectures that he 
gave.

260
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:57,400
That's all many people who did that lost
their back pain forever,

261
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,800
just listening to him.
So other people have had that happen.

262
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:02,940
Just reading his book,
I've read a little bit of it's,

263
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,830
you know,
I've had like legitimate injuries.

264
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:08,110
So whenever I hear someone say,
Oh,

265
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,570
it's all in your head,
it's not all in your head,

266
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,810
it's in your head and your mind,
your box in your head and your muscles,

267
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,673
and then the problem of muscle spasm,
which shuts off blood supply and it's a 

268
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:22,870
vicious cycle that that'll localize at 
an area you've had physical injury,

269
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,210
but the pain is not coming from the 
injury.

270
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,043
It's coming from muscle spasm and that's
controlled by a greatly influenced by 

271
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,360
the mind.
So when you,

272
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,223
when your back is like seizes up,
that is a muscle spasm and it's 

273
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:39,280
incredibly painful and it's located in 
the area of the injury.

274
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:42,790
So it doesn't confuse you into thinking 
it's the injury that's causing you pain.

275
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,470
What leads people into getting physical 
interventions that may not be necessary?

276
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,620
Yeah,
I'm a big believer in waiting,

277
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,483
especially with spinal stuff.
Solutely absolutely always want to fuse 

278
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,120
you and cut you.
And if you look at.

279
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,013
Here's another interesting thing.
You can look at x rays of people's 

280
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:04,870
spines that looks so horrible.
You can't imagine that they can move and

281
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,370
they have no nothing,
no symptoms.

282
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,263
And you can look at other x-rays that 
looked perfect and people are disabled 

283
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:11,224
by pain.
So there's a very low correlation 

284
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:16,210
between physical findings and subjective
experience.

285
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,830
Now,
what is Sarno recommend?

286
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,200
I never really recommends going about 
your business.

287
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,083
Go nobody even ignoring it,
going about your business and if 

288
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,880
possible,
try to figure out what,

289
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,970
what message you know,
your mind descending down there.

290
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,750
But basically it's a reassurance that 
it'll go away on its own.

291
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,900
So when he does these lectures and he 
has people cures him of it is just,

292
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,690
he just reassuring them that 
everything's going to in this process of

293
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,030
how he calls the tension Myositis 
Syndrome.

294
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,310
And he explains the mechanism of how it 
works.

295
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,710
One friend of mine,
he was in his late twenties,

296
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,720
uh,
played basketball,

297
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,554
had a very serious herniated discs.
He was within hours of having the real 

298
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,820
logical surgery,
spinal surgery.

299
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:01,210
And I yelled at him to read this book 
and CSR News in New York.

300
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,980
And he said,
I don't believe any of.

301
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,350
That's all bullshit.
And I said,

302
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,140
go,
go see him.

303
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,200
So he went the same.
Oh,

304
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:09,160
it went through the evening lectures.
Thought this was nonsense,

305
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,750
uh,
went home,

306
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:13,090
was having dinner and realized his back 
pain was gone,

307
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,043
never had surgery.
She's really know Scott to be something 

308
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:20,471
to that,
right?

309
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:22,750
There's,
there's something to the placebo effect.

310
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
So if there,
if,

311
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,953
if that is a real thing,
if you can convince your body that it's 

312
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,754
got the medicine that it needs and it 
starts to heal even though there's no 

313
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,334
medicine,
there's got to be something that is 

314
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,950
working against you as well with the 
wrong mindset.

315
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,490
It's funny to me to hear people 
rediscovering the placebo effect.

316
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:42,130
Now,
I wrote a book in 1983 called health and

317
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,230
healing and had two chapters in there.
One Placebos.

318
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,363
And what I wrote is that the greatest 
problem is that we know when we talk 

319
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,980
about placebos,
it's in phrases like,

320
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,240
how do you know that's not just a 
placebo effect.

321
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,103
The most interesting word there is just,
or we have to rule out the placebo 

322
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,150
effect.
We shouldn't be rolling it in,

323
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,830
man.
That's the meat of medicine.

324
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:01,664
That's pure healing from within mediated
by belief on mixed up with the direct 

325
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,610
effects of treatment.
That's what you want to make happen more

326
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,483
the time.
It just is a mind fuck for a lot of 

327
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:10,754
people because they're like,
how am I trick myself into getting 

328
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,460
better?
Why can't I just do it?

329
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,840
Because that must have something to do 
with the structure of the brain that the

330
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,230
part of the brain in which our will is 
isn't,

331
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,123
doesn't connect directly to the 
machinery of the body to the autonomic 

332
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:25,784
nervous system.
So you have to find some way of getting 

333
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:27,704
around that.
One way is to project belief onto 

334
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,570
something external and then let it work 
for you.

335
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,493
Yeah,
but that's so strange that the mind 

336
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,230
works that way.

337
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,063
It would seem like,
wouldn't it be an evolutionary 

338
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,220
advantage?
Just have it at access,

339
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,054
you know,
like.

340
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,930
Sure.
That'd be nice,

341
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:42,890
but that's the same thing.
You know,

342
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:43,724
it's a similar problem to why can't you 
just get high without taking a drug the 

343
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,100
highest in your brain,
not in the drug.

344
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:52,940
The drug is a trigger that releases it.
Why can't we just sit down and say,

345
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:53,774
well,
I'm going to be high for the next 10 

346
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,730
minutes.
So the same thing,

347
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,420
we don't have access to those controls 
to.

348
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,720
It just seems like that one though.
Healing getting better.

349
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,840
That one seems like it's something that 
we should as a culture concentrate on.

350
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,070
Yeah,
for sure.

351
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,220
What we really concentrate on is actual 
medicine,

352
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,054
but one way to concentrate that is by 
giving people greater confidence in 

353
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:14,564
their body's ability to do that.
And doctors have great power to do that 

354
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,730
because patients project a lot of belief
on them.

355
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,330
I've had many patients over the years 
who said that the most important thing I

356
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:24,164
did for them was that I was the only 
doctor who told them they could get 

357
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,230
better.
I mean,

358
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:30,270
astonishing.
Yeah.

359
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,903
Is it because doctors had just seen too 
many patients and they're overwhelmed 

360
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:37,160
and they got legal bills and they have.
I think some.

361
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,600
I've thought about this a lot and 
there's also the negative side of this.

362
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,434
I've seen what a,
there's something called medical hexing 

363
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:45,074
in which Dr say things that actually 
interfere with healing or caused people 

364
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:49,724
to get worse.
And I think a lot of this is done 

365
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,810
unconsciously.
Uh,

366
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,580
so here's one of my thoughts in their 
training.

367
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,200
Um,
Dr,

368
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,123
see a very skewed sample of sick people.
They see very sick people in hospitals 

369
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,580
and in that group,
healing is less likely to happen,

370
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,670
but if you look at the total spectrum of
illness,

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,460
the vast majority of things get better 
on their own.

372
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,803
So I think observing in yourself for 
wound healing is a good one to start 

373
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,130
with,
to get greater confidence in your body's

374
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:21,320
ability to do things that's really 
valuable.

375
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,520
So this obviously you're not talking 
about catastrophic injuries,

376
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:26,354
you just talking about general wellness.
I think even in the case of a 

377
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,520
catastrophic injury,
this stuff operates.

378
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:35,480
I worked a lot with hypnotherapists over
the years and one of the,

379
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,760
one of my colleagues,
uh,

380
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,693
did a lot of work in training paramedics
to be really careful about what you say 

381
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:44,150
around unconscious people who've been 
massively injured.

382
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,321
Uh,
you know,

383
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:46,220
when the,
if a,

384
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:49,830
if a paramedic takes an automobile 
accident victim and they're putting them

385
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,240
in,
says this one's a corner.

386
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,403
That is a bad thing.
You know the unconscious mind on and on 

387
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,440
the other hand you say something 
opposite to a person.

388
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,363
You can see cases where you can stop 
bleeding in unconscious people severely 

389
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,250
injured just by giving them suggestions.

390
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,930
Whoa.
Yeah.

391
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,780
So when you're saying someone's a goner,
you trigger stress.

392
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:15,160
Are you trigger helplessness?
Like what happened?

393
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,170
A medically trained person tell you that
you're not going to live.

394
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:20,370
That's a.
that's a curse.

395
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,110
Yeah.
That's saying well hex.

396
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,003
How strange is it that sometimes your 
life is hanging on the border of you 

397
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,760
believing you're going to be okay and 
you believe in you're not going to be.

398
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,530
Oh,
so you want to be very careful about,

399
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,540
you know whose hands you place yourself 
in.

400
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,603
Yes.
Never want to stay in treatment with a 

401
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:39,040
doctor who thinks she can't get better.
A negative doctor.

402
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,253
Well,
doctors are just like every other 

403
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,413
occupation.
There's people that are really good at 

404
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,310
it and it really concentrated and 
focused and there's people that are half

405
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,173
ass.
Well the ones I trained through our 

406
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:50,731
University of Arizona Center for 
Integrative Medicine get it.

407
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:51,660
You know,
we're putting out.

408
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,523
We've graduated about 1600 physicians 
now from very intensive training there 

409
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,114
in practice all over the country.
Teaching other people's is a good thing 

410
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,810
now.
When you say integrative medicine,

411
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:01,644
when they're in practice,
are they essentially general 

412
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,333
practitioners?
We've trained people from all 

413
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,860
specialties and specialty you can name.
We've trained them,

414
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,670
so orthopedic surgeons and neurologists,
dermatologists,

415
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:15,660
anything you could ever do and so you 
try to tend to look at them.

416
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,970
We teach them all the things they didn't
get in medical school,

417
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:18,900
nutrition,
mind,

418
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,743
body interactions,
strengths and weaknesses of alternative 

419
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,100
medicine,
herbal medicine,

420
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:23,934
all that like say someone comes to you 
and maybe they have a bad case of 

421
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,590
psoriasis,
autoimmune issue like that.

422
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,603
Prime prime target for mind body 
medicine for traditional Chinese 

423
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:34,764
medicine,
which often works well and in that 

424
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,840
dietary change,
but people on an anti inflammatory diet,

425
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,300
use of natural products that reduce 
inflammation,

426
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,433
so there's a wide range of things to 
choose from and this does not reject 

427
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,340
conventional treatment.

428
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,250
You know,
we may use conventional medication,

429
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,790
but if you do,
I recommend using the lowest dose of the

430
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,624
least potent agent.
Start off with that and you can ramp up 

431
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,140
if you need to.
Well,

432
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:00,780
a lot of people and me,
I'm definitely guilty of this.

433
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,643
They hear terms like holistic or eastern
medicine or Chinese medicine to go 

434
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,470
bullshit.
Right?

435
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,630
Well I have a good bullshit detector too
and so I'm really careful about what I,

436
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,400
you know,
accept and what I know.

437
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,620
Um,
what,

438
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,483
what do you not buy into?
Like when you see your bullshit 

439
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,350
detector,
like what were you.

440
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,420
I'll give you an example.
I've,

441
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,150
you know,
I've,

442
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,983
I'm not,
I can't see any basis for crystal 

443
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,040
healing.
Crystal my pocket right now.

444
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,903
Exactly.
Alright.

445
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,080
Well,
too bad.

446
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,100
How about the colonic irrigation people 
tell you,

447
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,240
tell you that they see a watermelon 
seeds coming out and you haven't eaten a

448
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:41,190
watermelon in months.
That's bullshit.

449
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,053
The,
the lining of the Gi track sloughed off 

450
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,130
and is regenerated every 24 hours.
There's no way that things can get

451
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,440
encrusted there.
Yeah,

452
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,240
that's a weird one.
The colonic thing,

453
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:56,560
because your body has all this natural 
bacteria that you're supposed to keep in

454
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:57,040
there.
Right?

455
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,873
Not only keeping there,
we're finding out that that's like more 

456
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:02,140
and more really important determinant of
everything,

457
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,150
of general health,
of mental health to.

458
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,290
Fascinating.
Yeah.

459
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,390
Whose idea was it to start doing those 
colonics?

460
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,430
That muscular way back.
That's kind of like a wacky idea.

461
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,530
Pumps water up there.
See what's up.

462
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,930
Yeah.
And you have to stand there when it gets

463
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:18,010
it.
It's addictive too.

464
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,000
I see people get addicted to this.
Yes.

465
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,113
Yeah.
So out of all the things I won't go 

466
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:22,984
further into.
My wife had it done once and she was 

467
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:26,560
describing it to me.
I'm like,

468
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:29,020
yeah,
I'm going to pass some lady's looking at

469
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,300
the two and telling you what's going on 
in their life.

470
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,520
At some point the is like looking at 
your shit.

471
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,200
Right?
It started as early as 1500 BC evers,

472
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,103
pop piracy in ancient Egyptian medical 
document described the many benefits of 

473
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:42,934
colon cleansing in ancient times.
The practice of cleansing the colon was 

474
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:51,091
administered in a river by using a 
hollow reed to induce water to flow into

475
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,084
the rectum.
We don't want to drink downstream of 

476
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,320
that.
Yeah.

477
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,030
And,
and,

478
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,540
uh,
you know,

479
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,373
there's no need to do this.
What you want to do is make sure that 

480
00:21:58,571 --> 00:21:59,404
things are going through in the right 
direction regularly and it cleans 

481
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,510
itself.
That's how it's supposed to do it,

482
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:05,020
right?
Yeah.

483
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,280
Yeah.
Another big one.

484
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,290
I hear all these people that talk about 
detox,

485
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,140
detoxification and sell all these 
products.

486
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,213
The body has many natural methods of 
purifying itself and getting rid of 

487
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,790
things with.
The other one is through sweating.

488
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,470
A one is through breathing,
one is through urination,

489
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,750
one is through colonic elimination.

490
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,913
Uh,
the liver has an incredible capacity to 

491
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,600
detoxify.
It can take,

492
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,580
you know,
you put something into your body,

493
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,503
the liver within seconds of seeing a 
compound that has never seen before can 

494
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:41,740
begin making a specific enzyme to take 
that apart and get rid of it.

495
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,143
Wow.
And you can amputate half of the liver 

496
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,350
and it can regenerate within 36 hours.
What's?

497
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,740
Yes,
livers amazing.

498
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:51,930
Thirty six hours.
Yeah.

499
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,580
So I thought when you gave someone like 
half your liver,

500
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,030
if there was like a liver transplant 
issue that took a long time.

501
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:00,830
I know liberty can regenerate really 
quickly and there's sand.

502
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,713
There's a natural product that you can 
take that most doctors don't learn 

503
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:05,950
about.
Cold milk thistle,

504
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,190
you've probably heard of that.
That revs up liver metabolism,

505
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,010
so you know these are all simple ways to
increase,

506
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,873
but the first rule of detoxification,
I'm sure you can guess you stopped 

507
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,344
putting toxic things in,
cut it off at the pass and let it let 

508
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,230
the body get purifies all.
Yeah,

509
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,243
well,
what do you do when someone's a 

510
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:28,360
cigarette smoker?
You tell them to set a date.

511
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:29,194
The quit set a date.
That's the most important thing because 

512
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,780
each attempt,
it doesn't matter if you succeed,

513
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:39,730
it's making the attempt to quit,
goes into a reservoir of motivation.

514
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,100
That one day will be fallen off.
That it's easy,

515
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,920
and this by the way,
happens with heroin.

516
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,130
Addicts,
happens with cigarette

517
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,200
addicts.
I've seen many people,

518
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,770
lifelong cigarette addict struggled,
gave it up,

519
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,643
came back one day they wake up and they 
look at stain fingers or a dirty ash 

520
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,560
tray and they don't want to do it 
anymore and it's an easy.

521
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,120
There's no struggle.
Same thing with heroin addicts,

522
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,973
so it has to do with motivation.
You can't put that into another person 

523
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,913
in.
All you can do is arrange circumstances 

524
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,543
that maybe it'll happen.
So the most important thing is to help 

525
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:13,610
you to set a date to quit and it doesn't
matter if they how long they stick,

526
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:14,444
but you're saying there's actually some 
strength to be gained from failed 

527
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,630
attempts.
Yes.

528
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:21,300
It's making the attempt that you get 
credit for really interesting.

529
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,193
Yeah.
So the more like say if you're a drunk 

530
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,870
and you keep falling off the wagon,
if you just keep making these attempts.

531
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes.
No really.

532
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,080
So there's something ramps up in your 
mind that makes it more feasible for you

533
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:34,190
to quit.
Yes.

534
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,870
And when it,
when it happens,

535
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,240
there's no struggle.
It's not,

536
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,240
it's not an issue,
it just,

537
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,103
you don't want to do it anymore.
Now what do you do when people come to 

538
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:46,280
you and they're on antidepressants?
Well,

539
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,440
I have a book called spontaneous 
happiness,

540
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:51,710
which is about emotional wellness,
is a lot there about antidepressants.

541
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:53,060
First of all,
they don't work so well.

542
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,953
You know that sometimes they work.
Sometimes it's hard to distinguish them 

543
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:58,900
from placebos,
you know,

544
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,650
the popular ones,
the Ssri,

545
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,020
and now because they don't work so well,
you know,

546
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:07,040
what doctors do,
they added one psychotic drug.

547
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,250
Horrifying.
These are for major mental illness.

548
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:13,130
They're not things you just add on to 
make the antidepressant work better.

549
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,720
We've talked about that one ad nauseum 
on this podcast because it turned out to

550
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:21,320
be the most prescribed drug in America 
that I can't believe that.

551
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,000
That's just astounding.
Well,

552
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,060
the word is that 25 percent of women 
between 40 and 50 are on antidepressants

553
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:34,130
in 10 percent of adults in the country.
All right.

554
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:35,690
Now here's another.
That's a crazy number.

555
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,310
Well,
first of all,

556
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,143
the pharmaceutical companies have done a
great job of convincing people that 

557
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:44,810
ordinary states of sadness are problems 
of brain biochemistry,

558
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,220
that you have to be treated with the 
drug.

559
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,900
We're not supposed to be happier with 
them.

560
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,393
Secondly,
there's a big problem with a lot of the 

561
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:55,550
medications that we use in 
antidepressants are a good example.

562
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,460
Most of the medications we use are 
counteractive.

563
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,230
No,
they oppose some process in the body.

564
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,460
So when you do that,
the body pushes back against it,

565
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:06,040
that's called homeostasis.
You know,

566
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,470
an easy example you can relate to as if 
you have a stuffed up nose,

567
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,910
you spray a drug in it that decongestant
you miraculous,

568
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:14,744
right?
You can breeze and depending on which 

569
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:17,390
drug you use,
two hours,

570
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:19,250
four hours at lasts.
But when it wears off,

571
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,200
you have rebound congestion that's 
worse.

572
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:26,060
If you use another dose of the drug,
then very easy to slide into a Jamie,

573
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,960
very easy to slide into a state of 
dependence on it.

574
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,480
Same thing happens with many of these 
drugs,

575
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:35,180
antidepressants,
they raise serotonin levels,

576
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,680
neuro junction,
neural junctions.

577
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:41,210
So what is the body going to do?
If you force an increase in Serotonin,

578
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:44,490
it's going to make less serotonin and 
drop serotonin

579
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,323
receptors.
So if you stay on one of these for any 

580
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,604
length of time when you get off,
you're gonna be in worse shape than you 

581
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,950
were to begin with.
And this is now has a medical name.

582
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:53,784
It's called tardive dysphoria,
meaning lingering bad mood due to the 

583
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:57,714
drug.
So the drug actually prolongs or 

584
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,560
intensifies the depression,
you know,

585
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:02,281
maybe.
Okay,

586
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:05,070
for very short term use of very severe 
depression,

587
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:08,670
but these are not things you want to go 
on and stay on for a length of time.

588
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,683
What's fascinating to me is when I 
talked to people that are on them that 

589
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:13,314
want to talk to you,
like they're on some cancer medication 

590
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,280
or they're on something that cures 
polio,

591
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,243
like they make it seem like you're 
insensitive to the possibility that 

592
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:25,950
there's other solutions and there are 
many other solutions.

593
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,793
We have really good evidence for the 
antidepressant effect of physical 

594
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:30,540
activity.

595
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,880
Yes.
Both to prevent and treat.

596
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,433
We have very good evidence for 
supplemental fish oil for omega three 

597
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:38,304
fatty acids to prevent and cbds well and
the microbiome looks like it's involved 

598
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:45,480
in our mental states as well.
So you know,

599
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:47,910
there's so many different ways of cbd 
for sure.

600
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,773
So again,
gets back to inflammation and it gets 

601
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:52,164
back to in an integrative approach and 
not just relying on a single thing like 

602
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,240
a pharmaceutical treatment.
Yeah.

603
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:58,074
I've talked to intelligent people that 
are on Ssri in one form or another and 

604
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:02,544
even ones that have struggled were on 
one for awhile and then it stopped 

605
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:05,634
working and then they tried another one 
and they're combining ones and they're 

606
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,173
on this weird sort of chemical 
rollercoaster and they reject any 

607
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,900
possible notion that there's other 
alternatives,

608
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,270
especially when you bring up the 
exercise one,

609
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,130
I bring up the exercise one,
they go,

610
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,200
oh,
this fucking meathead exercise.

611
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,060
We just stopped and I'm like,
I'm telling you.

612
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,423
We did this thing with my friends called
sober October and what we did is we no 

613
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,790
alcohol,
no anything for the month of October,

614
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:36,390
but also we did this fitness challenge 
and we got really carried away and we're

615
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:38,490
all competing against each other with 
this heart rate APP,

616
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,890
so we're working out three hours,
four hours a day.

617
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:41,724
It was crazy,
but what was interesting about it to me 

618
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,513
was not just that your body sort of 
adapts when you force it to work out 

619
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,010
that many hours,
but that your mood is phenomenal.

620
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,190
I've felt so good.
Yeah,

621
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,780
and I was telling everybody if you could
take what I like,

622
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:57,930
I don't feel that good right now.
I mean I felt great,

623
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:58,764
but I don't feel as good as I did during
October because I was working out four 

624
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:02,184
hours a day.

625
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,060
It was if you could get that in pill 
form,

626
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,163
you would take it every day if there was
no side effects because it literally 

627
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,250
removed anxiety.
All the internal chatter,

628
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,530
all the negative chatter,
it was gone.

629
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,570
Everything seemed amazing.
True.

630
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:21,090
And there are side effects of physical 
activity are great.

631
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,890
You know,
it revs up immune function,

632
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,830
improves the gesture and sleep,
all that you mentioned,

633
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,590
the anxiety,
the by far in a way,

634
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,440
the most effective treatment I found for
anxiety is simple,

635
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,410
a simple breathing technique,
regulating the breath.

636
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:35,244
I've seen this work for the most extreme
forms of panic disorder and the drugs 

637
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,444
that we use for anxiety or the worst.
The benzodiazepines are highly 

638
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:44,080
addictive.
Mess with your mind.

639
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,183
Yeah.
I have a good friend who has an issue 

640
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:51,100
with anxiety medication and he takes it 
all the time and when he does take it,

641
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,890
apparently it has that rebound effect.

642
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,710
Exactly right.
He gets horribly anxious.

643
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,573
Well,
these are handed out like candy and 

644
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:00,850
nobody warns people how addictive they 
are.

645
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:03,580
It's a worse addiction than an opiate.
Addiction.

646
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,450
It xanax real well.
I did not know that.

647
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,090
Harder to get off of opioids.
Wow.

648
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,523
Now how do you feel about psychedelic 
interventions when it comes to 

649
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,423
addiction?
It's like it seems that we're hearing 

650
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:19,894
more and more about that.
I know you have a background in that as 

651
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,290
well.
Well,

652
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,110
we're especially hearing about the Boga 
and Ibogaine.

653
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,900
This is the African a psychedelic and 
there are clinics and people using this.

654
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:32,170
The claim great success.
I don't have firsthand experience.

655
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,540
I only know what I've heard and what 
I've talked to people,

656
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,120
but sounds good and I think that most of
the psychedelics are so nontoxic,

657
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,553
so safe and in the right hands.
I think there's many possibilities for 

658
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,143
good outcomes.

659
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,223
Yeah.
They've also had some pretty good 

660
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:50,620
results with cigarette cessation.
Yep.

661
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,410
With not just a Bogo,
but even with psilocybin.

662
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,150
Yep.
Apparently they had,

663
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,763
they did a study where they show the 
difference between someone taking 

664
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,633
psilocybin to try to quit smoking 
cigarettes and some really large number 

665
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:06,694
of people.
I think it was the neighborhood of 80 

666
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,554
percent quit and then over the course of
x amount of years they were still at 60 

667
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:14,560
percent.
So only 20 percent of those people would

668
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:15,430
come back.
That's great.

669
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,410
But with other methods that the number 
was much smaller,

670
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,860
somewhere in the range of 20 or 15 
percent after six years,

671
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:24,694
a lot of them just went back to it.
What do you make of the microdosing 

672
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:27,761
phenomenon?
I mean,

673
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,594
this is pretty astounding to see this 
actual pussies you scared to jump all 

674
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:34,540
the way and get it all into one thing.

675
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,350
Scary man.
Why you want to medicate every day?

676
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,250
That's kind of how I feel.
No,

677
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,350
I'm just joking around.
Uh,

678
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,330
I think,
um,

679
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,273
I,
I know people who have experienced some 

680
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,533
pretty severe benefits of it,
especially people that weren't doing so 

681
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:50,224
good health wise and you know,
we're just really kind of feeling down 

682
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:56,050
and depressed and all of a sudden 
outlook radically changed.

683
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,153
Particularly psilocybin microdosing.
I know a lot of people who are doing 

684
00:31:59,351 --> 00:31:59,820
that.
Yeah,

685
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,160
same.
I have a lot of hope that Oregon becomes

686
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:03,994
the first state to.
Sounds like it's close to legalize 

687
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:07,271
suicide.
I've been,

688
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:09,190
that'd be a big one.
It would be gigantic.

689
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,024
And I think once we realized that no 
one's dying and a lot of people are 

690
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,144
getting helped and a lot of people that 
are terminal are having some really 

691
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,513
amazing alleviation of anxiety and an 
understanding that it's going to be 

692
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,070
okay.
And just,

693
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:27,820
uh,
I think between friends and just the,

694
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,833
just the camaraderie,
it sort of when you have these group 

695
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,780
experiences together,
like there's some incredible benefits to

696
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,800
that in terms of reinforcing

697
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,250
community and civilization the way we 
feel about each other.

698
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,143
Now,
aside from the psychological and 

699
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:45,794
emotional benefits,
I think you would be fascinated by some 

700
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:48,314
of the things that I've observed and 
written about of real physical benefits 

701
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,290
of psychedelics.
And I'll just tell you a couple.

702
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,930
Uh,
I,

703
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,240
when I was in my late twenties,
I did a lot of experiments,

704
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:02,690
was in the seventies with lsd mostly 
with lsd.

705
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,660
Um,
I had a lifelong allergy to cats.

706
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,730
If a cat got near me,
my eyes would itch,

707
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,950
my nose would run.
If a cat licked me,

708
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:10,784
I'd get highs were looking at me.
So I always avoided them and didn't let 

709
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:16,220
him touch me.
So I took lsd with a group of friends on

710
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:18,650
a Spring Day because we get Virginia 
fabulous,

711
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,484
you know,
I was outside running around having a 

712
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:22,640
lot of fun.
And in the middle of this the cat jumped

713
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:26,240
into my lap and I had a moment of like 
trying to defend myself.

714
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,440
And then I thought,
this is silly,

715
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,630
you know,
and I relaxed,

716
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,733
played with the cat,
had no allergic reaction and never did 

717
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,230
ever after the disappearance of an 
allergy that had been there all my life.

718
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,463
What would it be?
The physiological mechanism for some 

719
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,700
time?
Well,

720
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,930
then clearly that's a very profound mind
body interaction.

721
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:45,764
Now we know that allergies are 
influenced by that because you can show 

722
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,500
a personal allergic to roses,
a plastic rose,

723
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,620
and they'll have an allergy.
So.

724
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,210
So there's a learned component to 
allergy that can be unlearned,

725
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,500
but have an instant.
Yeah.

726
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,341
Interesting.
Now,

727
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,080
all right.
This is even more dramatic.

728
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,690
Maybe a year later,
same thing.

729
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:03,524
It was LSD in the spring.
I had also grown up with very fair skin 

730
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,280
and was told I couldn't get tan and we 
used to go down to the Jersey shore.

731
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,250
I can't remember.
I remember innumerable times,

732
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,113
you know,
gets getting second degree burns sheets 

733
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,780
of skin peeling off knock Zima at night.

734
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,760
We didn't have sunscreen in those days.
Right?

735
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,751
So,
uh,

736
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:22,040
I just accepted that.
So it was,

737
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,270
you know,
I can't get 10.

738
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,370
So again,
high on LSD,

739
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,683
lying out naked in my great woods in my 
home in Virginia and the sun was up 

740
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:35,930
there and I thought this is ridiculous.
You know,

741
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,764
I should not be afraid of the sun.
The next day I got Tan and I have ever 

742
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:41,360
since,
well that's a little more,

743
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,520
I'm not quite sure of the mechanism 
there,

744
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,740
but it's pretty long.
Were you outside for though?

745
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,970
Because if you're going to get burned,
I was out in good time.

746
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,660
You know,
I wouldn't,

747
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,110
I wouldn't have normally have.
Yeah,

748
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:53,250
at least I would have had,
you know,

749
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,360
my usual reaction,
but then my skin got tan it never had in

750
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,194
my life.
So what are you suggesting happened 

751
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,980
again?
You know,

752
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:05,180
there must be a way in which the nervous
system influences melana sites,

753
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,340
which are the,
the cell,

754
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,253
the pigment cells in the body that can 
either extend their projections with 

755
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,583
pigment granules.
So the nervous system controls that in 

756
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,493
the mind connects the nervous system.
But what about someone who's like 

757
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,863
ridiculously fair,
like what about someone who lives in 

758
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,084
Scotland?
What I would do is when Dr Weil's 

759
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:26,080
psychedelic clinic opens,
I would have an open,

760
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,430
well we'll see,
but there'll be an allergy program,

761
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:30,320
right?
You'd go in on the first day,

762
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,570
you take a full dose of something and 
you're exposed to the allergen and magic

763
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:36,404
happens.
And then you come in for 10 sessions 

764
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,040
with a

765
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,980
decreasing those and at some point 
you're not getting,

766
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:42,930
you're just getting a placebo and you 
don't know when that is.

767
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,970
And people are trained to lose their 
allergies.

768
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:47,150
I think you can do the same thing with 
suntanning.

769
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,780
Maybe not with people from Scotland 
because they've got fewer pigment cells,

770
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,173
but I wouldn't rule it out.
I'll tell you one more also from this 

771
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,770
period I told you I was playing with 
Yoga.

772
00:35:58,771 --> 00:35:59,604
There was one posture,
I couldn't do the plow where you lie on 

773
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,740
your back and try to touch your toes 
behind your head.

774
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,203
I got to where I could get my toes to a 
foot from the floor and I had 

775
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:12,390
excruciating pain in my neck and I.
As much as I tried that,

776
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:14,970
I made no progress.
So I was on the verge of giving up.

777
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,650
I thought I was too old.
He was 28.

778
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,740
So again,
when in an LSD state,

779
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
my body was feeling totally elastic.
I thought,

780
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,040
oh,
I'll try that.

781
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,143
So I'm lowering my feet.
I thought I had a foot to go and they 

782
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:28,200
touch the ground.
I couldn't believe it.

783
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,970
I was raised it lowered.
Oh Wow.

784
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:32,190
Fantastic.
The next day I tried to do it.

785
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,580
I got within a foot of the ground and 
had excruciating pain in my neck,

786
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,450
but now I knew it was possible before 
that I didn't know was possible,

787
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,553
so knowing it was possible I was 
motivated to keep at it and then a few 

788
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,900
weeks I was able to do it.
If I had not had that experience,

789
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,213
I would've given.
So I think this is the magic of these 

790
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:51,240
things.
They can show you possibilities.

791
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,360
They don't necessarily teach you how to,
how to maintain them,

792
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:56,250
but they can show you the things that 
possible.

793
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,083
You'd never believe what didn't even 
seem like it was just showing you a 

794
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:01,530
possibility.
It was actually showing a capability.

795
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,603
You are capable of moving in a way that 
you didn't think you were before and it 

796
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:08,660
was because of your own tension and 
worry.

797
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,653
Probably learned patterns of tension 
that had built up all my life and maybe 

798
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,860
some because of the conscious or the 
psychedelic state rather.

799
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,070
There's some alleviation of tension.
My mind was out of the way.

800
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,770
Yeah,
hm.

801
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,993
Well you do,
you definitely sense that with 

802
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,510
marijuana,
particularly edible marijuana,

803
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,140
you can really get good stretching in 
with edible marijuana.

804
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:33,210
It's almost like you.
I mean,

805
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,044
I,
I hate to use certain terms to just 

806
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,930
trigger people's bullshit alarms,
but there's a,

807
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,770
you can see,
you can feel more of the muscle,

808
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,140
you can see more of what's,
what it's doing,

809
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,100
right.
Whereas,

810
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,160
you know,
I'm,

811
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:53,640
I've been involved in martial arts and 
athletics growing up my life,

812
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:58,110
so I have a good awareness of my body,
but it's way better when I,

813
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:58,920
yeah,
metal,

814
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,150
edible,
edible marijuana.

815
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,343
Like I feel,
I understand like I can practice moves 

816
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,170
better,
like certain,

817
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,013
like kicking techniques.
I'm better if I'm more in tune with how 

818
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:10,794
everything's working together.
Whereas sometimes I can do it if I'm 

819
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:15,240
sober,
but it's,

820
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm almost like there's a prophylactic 
between me and my body.

821
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,460
There's a number next to it that gets 
removed by edible marijuana.

822
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,210
One other I'm fascinated by,
this was with MDM,

823
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,270
a,
uh,

824
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,420
I was,
I lived in a ranch outside of Tucson and

825
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:35,421
I had pathways that had a sort of large 
gravel and I could not walk on

826
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,490
that barefoot.
It really hurt my feet and if,

827
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,410
you know,
if I stood in them,

828
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,170
you could see Denson,
my feet on Mtma.

829
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,250
I was able to like dance on those 
stones,

830
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,084
no pain.
But the interesting thing is there were 

831
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:48,514
no marks on my feet.
So the pain is easy to figure out how 

832
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,210
that happens.
But what's happening that you know,

833
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,760
you don't get a dent.
I mean,

834
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,540
it seems to me if your mind is out of 
the way,

835
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,403
maybe little muscles there can,
are free to press back with just the 

836
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,350
amount of force to neutralize the 
pressure.

837
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,380
It's like if your mind is not 
interfering,

838
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:10,750
I think the body has amazing 
capabilities.

839
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:11,883
Well,
I definitely think you can mind fuck 

840
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,280
yourself.
Right?

841
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,620
And you can definitely think,
ah,

842
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,670
Oh God,
this is.

843
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,740
You can start thinking it's worse than 
it is.

844
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:19,890
Yeah.
And if you can relax a lot,

845
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,733
oftentimes there's many situations where
you relax and things aren't nearly as 

846
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,780
bad as you are making them out to be.

847
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,693
So that could be some.
I'm with you on everything except the 

848
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,110
tanning,
tanning.

849
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,053
I experienced it.
That's one of those things like big 

850
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:36,194
foot,
like when you should just keep it to 

851
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:38,580
yourself.
If you see the clip,

852
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,380
you're supposed to just go,
I'm not going to explain it.

853
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,214
I'm not going to keep that to myself 
because I know when people tell me 

854
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:45,814
things that I have no experience of,
I'm always willing to entertain the 

855
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:50,974
possibility.
But then I got to experience it for 

856
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:53,224
myself.
I'm willing to entertain it dependent 

857
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:55,990
upon who I'm talking to.
Right?

858
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,943
Because there's some Kooky people out 
there and you will entertain the 

859
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:02,510
possibility after possibilities until 
you die.

860
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,050
You realize you have one big Dr Seuss 
book.

861
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,480
Some people are just crazy.
You know,

862
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,910
we have to accept that.
True.

863
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,410
Yeah.
There's no doubt about it.

864
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,244
But I,
I am absolutely aware that there's some 

865
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:15,094
component.

866
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,023
There's something about the mind and the
way the mind interacts with matter and 

867
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:23,860
with life that has a profound effect on 
your body and it would be really nice if

868
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:24,694
we were all better at controlling that.
One of the insights that I've had in 

869
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:33,790
psychedelic states is that everything is
conscious.

870
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,570
That consciousness permeates everything 
that you know,

871
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,300
like I,
I feel whatever in me,

872
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:44,320
that my consciousness is also in rocks 
and in plants and animals,

873
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:48,430
that there are some universal something 
out there and it's.

874
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,230
There are two really different ways of 
looking at reality.

875
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,363
One is the materialist one,
which is the consciousness is a product 

876
00:40:57,131 --> 00:41:01,000
of brain biochemistry and electricity 
and that is dominant in science today.

877
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,223
The other is that the brain is a 
receiving apparatus for consciousness 

878
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:09,850
and that consciousness is primary maybe 
existed before matter,

879
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,703
maybe organized matter into forms that 
are more and we're able to experience 

880
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:16,480
themselves.
I don't know,

881
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,370
I don't think there's a way to prove one
or the other.

882
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:22,330
It's just that for me,
the conscious is the primary one is more

883
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,164
fun and makes life more interesting.
I'm sure you're familiar with rupert 

884
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:27,040
sheldrick.
Oh yeah.

885
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,690
He's good friend.
Very,

886
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,733
very interesting guy.
He has an idea that everything has 

887
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:34,170
memory.
He believes that that

888
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,473
bill,
this would be like the reason I guess 

889
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:39,830
why some people would not want to live 
in a haunted house.

890
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,863
Right.
They would think that if someone was 

891
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:42,254
murdered in the house that it would 
retain some memory of these atrocities 

892
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,053
and that you would somehow or another 
interact with that if you were in that 

893
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:50,044
house.
So like spaces like my dad is not a 

894
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,140
very,
he's not a woo kind of guy,

895
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,363
but he went to Gettysburg and he was 
telling me that when he was at 

896
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:03,770
Gettysburg that it just,
he felt profound sadness.

897
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,013
He's like,
it just seems like it's just in the 

898
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:08,510
ground,
like the whole area.

899
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,460
He goes,
I don't know how to describe it,

900
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,900
but I wanted to get the fuck out of 
there.

901
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,003
Like just just being around this era 
where this battle had taken place on so 

902
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,360
many people that died.

903
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,770
I said,
you could feel it,

904
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:19,950
huh?
Yeah.

905
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,240
I don't know if I buy it.
I mean,

906
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,420
but he's not the Kinda guy that know.
Right.

907
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,560
But that's an example where somebody 
tells you something that is experienced.

908
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,230
I'm willing to entertain it.
I have to experience it myself,

909
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,030
but it also could be,
you know,

910
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:32,864
like he um,
he got lucky and didn't get drafted 

911
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:41,270
during Vietnam and that's probably in 
his head that if he did get drafted,

912
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,104
he might've died over there.
And for what reason he wouldn't have 

913
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:47,750
experienced this life know why,
what is the.

914
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:48,723
And then thinking about these young men 
that died in the same fashion for some 

915
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,010
war that didn't make any sense.
Like why the fuck are they even fighting

916
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:55,600
it?
Like who,

917
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,530
whose,
why,

918
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,403
why is this a.
and then having all these people die 

919
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:03,080
together in this one horrible battle in 
this one place.

920
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,750
And he could have been,
he was playing a game on his mind.

921
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:06,584
But now joe,
I want to talk to you about your 

922
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:10,940
language.
Why the fuck do you swear so much?

923
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,010
I don't know.
Have you read anything about the science

924
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:14,100
of swearing?
No.

925
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,010
Do you know that there is a science of 
swearing?

926
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,940
Escience?
Yes.

927
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:18,620
It's pretty interesting stuff.
Oh,

928
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,680
so the part of your brain that produces 
swear words is not the part of the brain

929
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,550
that manages ordinary language.
Really interesting.

930
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,541
Uh,
you know,

931
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,750
we have two language centers and our 
left frontal Cortex,

932
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,183
uh,
people that have strokes that damage 

933
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:39,650
them often lose language completely,
but they can still swear.

934
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,710
So swearing is coming from somewhere 
else.

935
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,560
It may be coming from the right 
hemisphere,

936
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,723
but it's also coming from deeper centers
in the brain that connect to the limbic 

937
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,470
system and the Amygdala.

938
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,560
And that connects to the involuntary 
nervous system.

939
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:59,150
So here's a couple of interesting facts.
Swearing is associated with sweating,

940
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,013
increased sweating,
so you should be dripping with sweat 

941
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,890
that much.
I'm a comedian also.

942
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:07,724
Interesting swearing,
a increases pain tolerance and there's 

943
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:12,584
an interesting experiment.
Know the standard way they do paint 

944
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,154
colors.
They have people stick their hand in a 

945
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:19,790
bucket of ice and water and you see how 
long they can keep it there.

946
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,650
That people who say fuck shit can keep 
it there much longer than people who are

947
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:27,260
not allowed to swear.
What about noises?

948
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:30,100
What if they just go?
No,

949
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,740
it was swearing specifically,
so they've tried noises and swearing and

950
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:35,130
so it may be,
you know when you,

951
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,380
if you're hammering a nail,
hit your thumb.

952
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,570
Yeah,
you use one of those words.

953
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:40,404
That's a good strategy.
That's interesting because I almost 

954
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:42,780
always do that.

955
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,613
If I heard something,
especially a finger slammed a car door 

956
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,520
the other day,
I don't want to.

957
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,250
So that's what that is,
but that's.

958
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:51,180
Yeah,
and it's interesting.

959
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,023
It's coming.
There's a different part of the brain 

960
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:56,520
that that manages that has different 
emotional content.

961
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,530
Yeah.
It flavors language.

962
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,810
Yes.
I live them.

963
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,880
I'm a big fan of this.
Whereas I'll leave you some papers about

964
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:04,540
the science of swearing.
It's interesting.

965
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,340
It's very interesting now what it will.
What would happen if they were no longer

966
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:12,210
taboo with the St Louis area?
I think they lose their power.

967
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,393
Yeah,
right.

968
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,500
The same areas of the brain wouldn't 
know.

969
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,380
I remember there was an episode of,
I don't remember what television show,

970
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:24,381
but it was on cbs and they had a line at
the end of the show and essentially they

971
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:28,800
were saying,
shit happens and it was a big deal.

972
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,673
I'll bet it was a big deal that they 
wanted to be able to say shit happened 

973
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,323
and apparently they pulled this off and 
they got it through and it was like a 

974
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:36,511
10:00
PM show,

975
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:39,060
so it was okay and it was 11:00
by the time they said Shit.

976
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,340
And I remember thinking like,
wow,

977
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:42,174
what a strange sort of like how many 
people were involved in this sort of 

978
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,770
dance.
Like how many lawyers and executives and

979
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:51,500
who.
It's very strange,

980
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:54,990
very strange that this one word would 
treat everybody knows the word.

981
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,650
It's not even that kind of game.
We all,

982
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,540
yes,
but so,

983
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,374
but you're saying this game is 
facilitated by one specific part of the 

984
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:08,630
brain and so that because like,
I don't know,

985
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,683
words are taboo words,
taboo words and often associated with 

986
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:17,400
things that we find offensive or with 
bodily acts that freak people out.

987
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,050
So,
but so there's both,

988
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,570
there's a psychological social aspect to
it,

989
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,490
but there's also a neurological aspect 
to it.

990
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,230
Now when the words like some some words 
for some people,

991
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:29,064
like I remember when I was a kid,
I lived in Florida for a little bit and 

992
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:37,550
I said Hell once and in Florida in the 
19 seventies.

993
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,830
Hell was a swear.
Like,

994
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:41,580
yeah,
I don't know.

995
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:42,414
I mean I came from New Jersey and then I
was in San Francisco and then also in 

996
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:47,640
Florida and I said Hell.
And they're like,

997
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,320
don't swear like that in this class.
I was like,

998
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,450
where the fuck are you people talking 
about?

999
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,450
Like it didn't make any sense to me and 
that I was like,

1000
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:55,284
you guys have different swears now.
If you had a word that was not taboo to 

1001
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,580
you,
would it be,

1002
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,080
would that same area of your brain?
I know this is,

1003
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,830
there has not been a lot of research but
it hasn't been taken seriously,

1004
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:14,700
but that's all interesting questions I 
should have studied because some.

1005
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,490
I mean if you're a really super 
conservative person,

1006
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,320
there's a lot of words that are off the 
table.

1007
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,960
Yeah.
But if you are a far more,

1008
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,680
which is loose with your language,
you could shit this,

1009
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,580
God damn it,
you know,

1010
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,090
that would be nothing like God damn.

1011
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,760
It would be just like,
aw shucks.

1012
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:31,900
Yeah,
yeah.

1013
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,003
But to someone,
God damn it would be like a really bad 

1014
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,460
deal.
Really big deal.

1015
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:37,923
So what would be different parts of the 
brain would be activated by that versus 

1016
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,430
if you said it,
it would be not that big a deal,

1017
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:48,240
but if someone was like super 
conservative and they said even more.

1018
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,421
Wow.
Yeah.

1019
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:50,350
Interesting.
What do you,

1020
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,450
do you think that that is a universal.
I mean,

1021
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:54,210
it seems to be,
seems to be universal.

1022
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:57,460
It seems to be universal.
Another finding that came across is that

1023
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:01,780
people who learn a second language that 
swearing in the second language does not

1024
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:04,510
have the same emotional impact that your
first language.

1025
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:07,450
Does that make sense?
That's why they're so fun when you learn

1026
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:11,500
Spanish.
Swears like you get a free ride.

1027
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

1028
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,230
That's interesting.
Yeah,

1029
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,453
that makes sense.

1030
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,650
Yeah.
And you can do them on television too,

1031
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,310
right?
You can say a lot of Spanish,

1032
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:23,680
whereas in English speaking TV and 
everybody just pleads ignorance.

1033
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,760
Do you.
So does every language has.

1034
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,390
They all have swears.
Every language has words,

1035
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,680
swear words.
It's universal.

1036
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,100
That is really interested in Asian 
languages,

1037
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:37,540
European languages.
All of them,

1038
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,100
Huh?
Wow.

1039
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,140
Huh.
So that,

1040
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,410
that would,
at least in my brain,

1041
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,080
seemed to indicate that there's some use
for that.

1042
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,950
Yes.
Well,

1043
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,600
probably many users.
One is this thing of modulating pain.

1044
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:54,940
What is a social bonding?
You know,

1045
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,560
forming some community.
Yeah,

1046
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:59,500
that's how I kind of use it.
I think when I swear in front of people,

1047
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,510
I'm testing them out.
Like you freaking out.

1048
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,344
If I say fuck you,
I can't talk to you like you too much 

1049
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:05,680
work,
you know,

1050
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,463
you don't know exactly what if you're 
talking to someone and every other word 

1051
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,380
like,
well I really wish you wouldn't use that

1052
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,170
language is there's so much work to do 
here.

1053
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,920
I can't hold your hand dance through 
this garden.

1054
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:18,843
Right?
Yeah.

1055
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,140
It's,
um,

1056
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,440
it's to me also like I hang around with 
a lot of people that swear a lot because

1057
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:30,310
I hang around with professional 
comedians and fighters and there's a lot

1058
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:31,144
of swash swashbuckling,
freewill and type of individuals 

1059
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:35,764
involved in those pursuits and now 
they're seeing that there's some study 

1060
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,060
suggesting that swearing is becoming 
more frequent in our society because,

1061
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:45,400
I don't know,
it's a trend.

1062
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:46,234
I'm not sure anybody knows why,
but I mean somebody would have been on 

1063
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:52,240
the air like you are 20 years ago.
That's true.

1064
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,340
Yeah.
Well that is specifically because of the

1065
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:56,110
Internet because there were like,
yeah,

1066
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,760
yeah.
But even that,

1067
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,130
it's like,
it's resisted in a lot of ways,

1068
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:00,964
like people are trying to figure out how
to modulate this and how to handle it 

1069
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:04,440
and they'll never handle it.

1070
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,810
It's like the genie's out of the bottle.
Right,

1071
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:07,644
exactly.
Yeah.

1072
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,003
Um,
I think ultimately you find what you 

1073
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,674
enjoy and the best way to find with what
you enjoy is people actually doing what 

1074
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:16,180
they want to do and then you figure it 
out.

1075
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,400
Exactly.
Yeah.

1076
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,570
I mean,
that seems to be what's happening in the

1077
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:21,910
world of the Internet and podcasting and
stuff like that.

1078
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,200
It's also the the access,
right?

1079
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:27,034
Like a person like you,
you could just put together a podcast 

1080
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,540
and if people find it interesting,
if it resonates,

1081
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,140
you could get a 100,000
downloads out of nowhere,

1082
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:39,020
like 100,000.
If she have a radio show,

1083
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,340
100,000
people listening.

1084
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,950
That's a lot of damn people.
If they'd be excited and be like,

1085
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:43,784
Hey Andrew,
we got the monthly in and you're doing 

1086
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,090
great.
You've got 100,000

1087
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:48,140
people a day.
They'd be like,

1088
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:50,840
Holy Shit,
this is a successful business,

1089
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,180
but you could be doing that just from 
your office.

1090
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,013
Just put together with a laptop and a 
microphone and no distribution 

1091
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:58,664
whatsoever in terms of like no string of
executives and gigantic corporation 

1092
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:03,974
behind you.
You don't have nobody telling you what 

1093
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,310
you can say.
Kansas.

1094
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,263
Yeah.
Well that's one thing you get out of 

1095
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:11,420
today that you never got out of before 
and you know,

1096
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,383
this is.
I've been involved in show business for 

1097
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:16,034
many years,
but only this kind of stuff for nine 

1098
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:23,860
from doing this podcast and what I've 
seen with this is like what's unusual.

1099
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:28,250
I think what resonates with people is 
that there isn't anybody else.

1100
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,820
There's no group of people that saying,
Andrew,

1101
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,063
could you stop saying this or let's,
let's concentrate on that and the polls 

1102
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:38,750
are showing that people like this and 
you know,

1103
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,440
you have breaks in between what the 
commercials are playing and they come to

1104
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:45,020
you with notes and they tell you all 
that stuff too.

1105
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,853
Seems to somehow or another ruin this 
natural interaction that we have with 

1106
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,090
each other.
Yeah.

1107
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,210
Yeah.
Now for a guy like you,

1108
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,373
the Internet is.
I would think that with some of your 

1109
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:59,780
more controversial ideas like this is 
the way you could really air them out in

1110
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:03,620
long form because if you like a lot of 
doctors,

1111
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:08,720
they don't want to open their mind to 
anything outside of what their,

1112
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,510
what their practice.
Yeah.

1113
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,840
I mean it's gonna be rough for you.
Right?

1114
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,990
But I've never censored what I say.
I've always put it all out there.

1115
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:15,943
Good for you.
Yeah,

1116
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,080
I've done that all my life.
But do you,

1117
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:23,000
don't you find that it's more not just 
accepted,

1118
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:26,540
but people are more interested in it now
because of the Internet?

1119
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,560
Yeah,
for sure.

1120
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:28,850
Yeah,
absolutely.

1121
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,160
Because I've heard about you for many,
many years,

1122
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,630
but it's sort of ramped up over the last
decade or so,

1123
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,760
right?
Yeah.

1124
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:38,970
Because of the Internet,
right?

1125
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,070
Because people have this,

1126
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,193
but you know,
I've been around.

1127
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,780
It's funny when I look at this stuff 
like,

1128
00:52:43,781 --> 00:52:46,560
you know,
all this stuff about pot and placebos.

1129
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,690
I was saying this stuff in the 19 
seventies,

1130
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,740
you know,
my first book,

1131
00:52:50,741 --> 00:52:51,574
the natural mind was published in 1972.
It argued that everybody has an innate 

1132
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:57,820
drive to alter their consciousness.
You know,

1133
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:59,980
drugs are one way of doing it.
Uh,

1134
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:00,814
I did the first human experiments with 
pot that we're ever done with a under 

1135
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,120
double blonde conditions,
but experiments.

1136
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:06,954
Did you do.
I gave marijuana to people in a 

1137
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:11,740
laboratory in 1968.
And would you test them for?

1138
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:12,723
Well,
we were just seeing people bet me you 

1139
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:15,880
couldn't do it.
Nobody had ever done this.

1140
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,280
You know,
the oldest marijuana was becoming such a

1141
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:20,740
big thing and nobody,
there were no experiments.

1142
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:21,931
Like what,
what,

1143
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:24,970
what kind of experience.
So we took the most basic stuff.

1144
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:25,823
I just wanted to show that you could 
give it to the human subjects in a lab 

1145
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:29,310
and get away with it because people 
thought,

1146
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,020
you know,
I mean,

1147
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,300
in terms of the ftes,
in terms of law,

1148
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:34,500
lawsuits,
everything.

1149
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:35,850
And uh,
one of the things I wanted to give it to

1150
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:37,590
people that never had it before to 
speak.

1151
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:41,220
So there'll be no expectations.
Everyone said this is terrible,

1152
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,054
you know,
they're going to turn it to heroin 

1153
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:44,490
addicts from giving them stuff like 
that.

1154
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,353
Anyway,
I just wanted to see basic stuff like 

1155
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,970
does it dilate the pupils of the eyes 
because cops were busting people,

1156
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,830
you know,
they'd say their eyes are dilated,

1157
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,800
must be high on marijuana and they'd 
searched,

1158
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,643
but marijuana doesn't,
it doesn't dilate the pupils of the 

1159
00:53:58,081 --> 00:53:59,690
eyes.
I took chat,

1160
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,533
tested blood sugar because people said 
the reason people get hungry is because 

1161
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,310
blood sugar drops has no effect on blood
sugar.

1162
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,563
Uh,
we showed that the people who had never 

1163
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,334
had marijuana before in a lab,
you could show slight decreases in 

1164
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:16,254
performance,
in motor function and cognitive 

1165
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:21,240
function,
but people who were regular users of it,

1166
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:23,330
you couldn't show that,
that they added that too.

1167
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:24,503
Yeah.
My take on that is that I think that 

1168
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,080
people that are not regular users are 
freaking out.

1169
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,303
Yeah.
And because their sensations and then 

1170
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:35,550
I'll do it and they just don't.
They don't know how to relax.

1171
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,333
I mean that's the big one to me with a 
physical movement because they want to 

1172
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,910
test drivers and all sorts of things.
For Marijuana.

1173
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:46,270
I'm like,
this is not alcohol.

1174
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,970
You're now in a completely different 
thing.

1175
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,470
If I had a choice of being a passenger 
with these drivers,

1176
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:53,304
I'll tell you which one I would take.
A person who had never used marijuana 

1177
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,900
had just smoked.

1178
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,590
A person who was a user of marijuana and
it just smoked it.

1179
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:04,620
It never driven high.
A person who was a user,

1180
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:05,454
a regular user of marijuana and practice
driving high and a person with any 

1181
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:10,980
amount of alcohol in their system.
I take the third as the best,

1182
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,250
best,
best.

1183
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,220
Yeah.
That guy's a wizard at bet.

1184
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,160
That guy drives high every day.
So He's used to it.

1185
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,170
I'm not going to show any effect on his 
performance.

1186
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,930
The experiences,
a novel experience.

1187
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,380
And if you're accustomed to it then it's
just like,

1188
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:27,030
here we go.
This is my normal world.

1189
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,980
And for many people you have to learn to
get high.

1190
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:29,814
You have to learn to associate the 
subtle physical cues with the altered 

1191
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,010
state.
That's a common thing.

1192
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:37,080
People could feel nothing the first time
they try it.

1193
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,840
Yeah,
you do hear that right?

1194
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,550
But I don't think they know what the 
fuck they're talking to.

1195
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,180
Throw your eyes.
Fuck.

1196
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,910
Now when you,
uh,

1197
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:45,983
when you did these experiments,
what did you have to clear these with 

1198
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:51,330
the FPA?
What did you would not believe I have to

1199
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:52,164
do?
I had to get permission from the FDA 

1200
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:54,504
which said that I couldn't do it unless 
I first got permission from it was the 

1201
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:59,820
old Federal Bureau of narcotics,
which was the treasury guys.

1202
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,223
The federal bureaucratic said,
we'll give you permission once the FDA 

1203
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,790
gives you permission.
So they played that off,

1204
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:09,390
then I had to get permission from the 
state of Massachusetts from two agencies

1205
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:11,750
there and there were two universities 
involved,

1206
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,830
Harvard University and Boston 
University.

1207
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,830
So coordinating all this stuff was 
unbelievable.

1208
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,930
And then once the old the approvals came
in,

1209
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,480
I had to get the pot and there was no 
legal source of it.

1210
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,700
So I,
I,

1211
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,220
the Federal Bureau of narcotics

1212
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,970
gave me confiscated pot that they had 
confiscated case in Texas.

1213
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,360
They brought it over.
They had delayed for so long.

1214
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:32,194
I didn't even know her that time to do 
the experiments because I was going to 

1215
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:34,594
graduate anyway.
They brought this stuff on a Friday 

1216
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,900
afternoon.
It was shit.

1217
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:38,734
I mean it was brown dry,
it looked like even sitting in a 

1218
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:40,924
warehouse for years.
So the first thing I did was roll up a 

1219
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:44,470
joint and smoke it no effect,
whatever.

1220
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:47,230
I called the,
the agent that I dealt with and I said,

1221
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:48,700
this stuff is no good.
And he said,

1222
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:51,010
how do you know you haven't had time to 
run any experiments?

1223
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:51,844
And I said,
I looked at it under the microscope and 

1224
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:53,644
there was no resonance on it,
so they grumbled and they gave me other 

1225
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:59,320
stuff which was passable.
But again,

1226
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,790
confiscated stuff.
Yeah.

1227
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,880
Because we always used to hear when we 
were kids about government,

1228
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:06,870
we'd the government lead was the good 
weed.

1229
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,140
Do you remember later?
That was later when that,

1230
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,323
when research got going and the US 
government started a pot farm in 

1231
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:17,500
Mississippi to provide proper research,
which was much better.

1232
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,890
And there was only a handful of people 
that were under these experiments.

1233
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,400
So they made it so difficult to conduct 
research as they have with psychedelics.

1234
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:28,450
No,
that's slowly changing now.

1235
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,380
Yeah.
Well,

1236
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:31,270
um,
you know Rick Strassman?

1237
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,020
Sure.
Yeah.

1238
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,420
When he was doing that book,
Dmt,

1239
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:37,600
the spirit molecule and he did all those
tests with those people.

1240
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:39,670
That was really groundbreaking stuff 
because,

1241
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:41,530
you know,
doing it at the University of New Mexico

1242
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:42,364
and doing my clinical conditions,
they were able to document the 

1243
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:48,880
similarities between all these people's 
psychedelic experiences and do this with

1244
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,820
government approval,
which I thought was really fascinating.

1245
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:52,770
Fascinating.
Yeah.

1246
00:57:52,771 --> 00:57:53,604
And the fact that they did it and the 
information's out and then there's been 

1247
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:00,250
very little movement in that direction.

1248
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,110
It's Kinda just like,
okay,

1249
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,670
now we know,
but look,

1250
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:06,030
everybody's fine.
A lot of benefit do,

1251
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,830
do we want to act on this?
Like,

1252
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,550
you know,
it takes decades,

1253
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,840
forever and flawless.
What research was done all along,

1254
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,110
it was February to look for negative 
effects.

1255
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,570
Uh,
no.

1256
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,900
Nobody who wanted to look for positive 
effects.

1257
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,360
Got Permission and funding.
That's interesting.

1258
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:25,810
So you have to kind of frame the 
proposal in a way that like,

1259
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,840
were these kids are fucking themselves 
up and we're gonna prove it sir.

1260
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:30,550
So that's changing.
But you know,

1261
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:31,384
the big stumbling block now we got to 
get a cannabis out of that federal 

1262
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:37,930
schedule.
That's like causing a lot of problems.

1263
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,853
Yeah.
There's been some noise about 

1264
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,510
decriminalizing decriminalizing it 
federally,

1265
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,480
which is like step one.
I guess that's a big stumbling block.

1266
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,314
I'll give you one example.
I'm involved with a group called Maui 

1267
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:53,950
wellness group.
I'm the chief science officer now.

1268
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:54,850
He Hawaii.
Yeah.

1269
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:58,330
We got the first dispensary license and 
growing operation over there.

1270
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:59,500
Oh Nice.
Very good,

1271
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:03,580
very good example in Hawaii for medical,
not for recreational,

1272
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:08,270
like how sick you have to be where 
they're getting a little you,

1273
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,333
but they're specified conditions.
Hawaii's not is more uptight than a lot 

1274
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:15,570
of other states it's happening,
but uh,

1275
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:19,270
our licenses for Maui County,
which includes Mallory Mold County,

1276
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:22,010
Illinois,
so people from all the time and I

1277
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,980
can come to Maui to buy product and our 
dispensary,

1278
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:28,460
but they can't take it back because the 
waters between the island or federal,

1279
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,660
they throw it still has to cross the 
water.

1280
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,070
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

1281
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,600
You know,
that's federal,

1282
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,730
that's a kind of as the kind of 
ridiculous situation.

1283
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,490
So better to be in Maui and not better 
to run.

1284
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,910
I got to go to Maui to get high.
That's great.

1285
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:43,744
What if you're really sick?
Like what have you have cancer or 

1286
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:46,100
something like that?
Well,

1287
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,260
on live,
on Lanai.

1288
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah.
Well you got to violate the law,

1289
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,850
but if you have it in Lanai,
you're okay.

1290
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,580
So can you grow it a.
no,

1291
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,200
you can only grow it if you have a 
license.

1292
00:59:56,201 --> 01:00:00,310
And the only licenses for Jesus Christ,
we got to change this.

1293
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,490
California was really ridiculous when 
they were doing medical look.

1294
01:00:03,491 --> 01:00:04,850
You can just basically go in there and 
go like,

1295
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,030
I can't sleep.
Then go.

1296
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:07,020
Okay.
Yeah.

1297
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,413
It was nothing.
Like I had friends that had like long 

1298
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:13,970
elaborate excuses.
They have planned out like,

1299
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:15,123
you know,
I was in a car accident while six and I 

1300
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,570
go to bed at night and I have these 
horrible dreams.

1301
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:22,270
The only thing that helps you is 
marijuana and I'm just trying to feed my

1302
01:00:22,271 --> 01:00:23,290
family and that they would go,
stop,

1303
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:24,124
stop,
stop.

1304
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,800
Okay.
I'm read this script and just give it to

1305
01:00:26,801 --> 01:00:28,210
you.
There was no resistance.

1306
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:29,163
If you.
My joke was that if you can't get a 

1307
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:32,164
license for marijuana,
you probably go to a hospital 

1308
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,620
immediately because you had a real 
problem.

1309
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,611
Like,
no man,

1310
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:37,730
you need an actual doctor.

1311
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,070
I'll tell you a story.
This is something that bothers me though

1312
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,870
I'm not.
I'm not a user of pot.

1313
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:45,920
And I was heavily in my earlier life.
A friend of mine,

1314
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:48,780
Dr.
Colleagues in San Francisco sent me some

1315
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:49,614
samples of stuff that had come from a 
medical dispensary in San Francisco and 

1316
01:00:53,101 --> 01:00:56,670
he wanted me to try them.
So one of them was a concentrated oil,

1317
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:57,504
it came in a little syringe and an ad 
had a very elaborate nicely printed 

1318
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:03,263
brochure with it that describe the use 
of this pain and it said you should 

1319
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:09,660
start with an amount the size of half a 
grain of rice,

1320
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,580
uh,
take it orally.

1321
01:01:11,581 --> 01:01:14,280
So yeah,
my friends had taken at bedtime,

1322
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:15,114
so this is a teeny amount and actually I
probably took somewhat less because I 

1323
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:20,040
was afraid of getting too high on it.
So I take it at bed time,

1324
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,143
went to sleep,
woke up about an hour later in full 

1325
01:01:23,821 --> 01:01:24,870
blown delirium.

1326
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:25,703
I mean,
visual hallucinations as strong as I've 

1327
01:01:28,501 --> 01:01:30,270
had on LSD.
I couldn't get out of bed.

1328
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:30,590
I,
I,

1329
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,680
you know,
I was immobile.

1330
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,030
Yeah.
I had burning thirst.

1331
01:01:33,031 --> 01:01:34,590
I couldn't get up to get a glass of 
water.

1332
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,280
I had a friends thing and a guest house 
I couldn't call for help.

1333
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:39,623
I laid there and it kept increasing.
Over four hours it got stronger and 

1334
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:45,720
stronger and when is it gonna end.
Anyway,

1335
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:46,554
it lasted 12 hours and uh,
for about 24 hours after my equilibrium 

1336
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:55,350
was really long and this stuff is being.
And it said,

1337
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,333
it said the direction said,
start with this amount and work up from 

1338
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,040
there.
People.

1339
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,900
I'm thinking there's people driving on 
the streets.

1340
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,850
This stuff is out there.
That scares me.

1341
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:06,923
Yeah.
There's people that support that whole 

1342
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:12,210
thing and their gullet right.
I'm sure you know.

1343
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:12,910
So

1344
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:13,743
No.
A lot of the edible world is a weird 

1345
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:18,040
world because of the,
the,

1346
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:18,973
the response.
The body is so much different than the 

1347
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:24,200
smoking.
Different drug as a lot of the,

1348
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,380
you know,
the long length of time it takes.

1349
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,620
So you know,
it's like lighting the fireworks and the

1350
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:30,970
fuse is down and you go back and try to 
light it again.

1351
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:36,040
And I'm sure you've heard the recording 
of the police officers who stole the pot

1352
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:40,600
from the kids and then ate it and then 
called nine slash 11 on themselves.

1353
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,690
No,
never heard it.

1354
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,720
Oh,
that's wonderful.

1355
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,060
I'll play it again because we played it 
too many times in this podcast.

1356
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:45,680
Okay.
I'll look it up.

1357
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,513
But this poor cops,
they ate pot brownies and they're 

1358
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:50,064
calling nine slash 11 like I think.
I think we're dying times moving really 

1359
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:55,740
slowly.
I think we're dead so stupid.

1360
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,640
So stupid.
It's,

1361
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,440
it's good for kids to hear because you 
realize like,

1362
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,710
oh,
cops are just people.

1363
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,780
Oh,
all right.

1364
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,623
Okay.
It's just,

1365
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,580
it sounds like my brother,
my brother got high.

1366
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:06,450
You know,
it's crazy.

1367
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:07,284
People that get high,
but the effect of the edible can be 

1368
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:12,960
pretty,
pretty fucking profound.

1369
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:13,794
And this area in particular,
like Hollywood has some pre imposturous 

1370
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,020
thc level.
Imagine.

1371
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:21,863
Yeah.
They're under different regulations now 

1372
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:26,280
that it's legal statewide instead of 
just medical,

1373
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:31,430
but when it was medical only,
you could get these insane concoctions.

1374
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:32,843
Stars of death.
You ever heard of a startup that will 

1375
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,990
hit you with a star at death stars,
they're like 1200 milligrams.

1376
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,270
They range anywhere from like 200 to 
three,

1377
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,163
400.
Each little star is hundreds of 

1378
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,370
milligrams and joey would eat like three
or four of them ate.

1379
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,550
He would just throw them down.
He's a,

1380
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:58,560
he's got an insane tolerance.
He just wanted these guys given all this

1381
01:03:58,561 --> 01:03:59,394
stuff.
However,

1382
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:04,180
I am delighted to see our society 
finally coming to better terms with this

1383
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:07,760
plant me to cannabis.
You know,

1384
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,594
the,
the,

1385
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,730
the word cannabis,
the same word as canvas.

1386
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,210
All canvas sales and rope used to be 
made from hemp.

1387
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,513
Uh,
the and the species name Sativa means 

1388
01:04:17,871 --> 01:04:18,980
useful.
It's useful.

1389
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,840
It's really useful.
You know,

1390
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:21,674
this is one plant that provides an 
edible seed and edible oil of high 

1391
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:26,780
quality fiber,
uh,

1392
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:30,530
medicine and an intoxicant that's a lot 
of ways for a plant to be useful.

1393
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:31,783
Uh,
we have been very stupid in our 

1394
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:36,830
relationship with that plant.
The cannabis,

1395
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:39,680
it's the equivalent of the dog in the 
plant world.

1396
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:43,370
Dogs long ago made a decision to co 
evolve with us.

1397
01:04:43,371 --> 01:04:45,950
They threw their evolutionary lot in 
with humans.

1398
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,203
Cannabis did the same thing.
You can't unravel the early botanical 

1399
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:53,120
history of cannabis because as far back 
in history as we go,

1400
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:55,490
it's always associated with human 
settlements.

1401
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,780
So that plant wants nothing other than 
to be with us at the service.

1402
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,913
And we have been so stupid,
we've led a billion dollar industry and 

1403
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:04,903
textiles go to China.
We've let a million dollar industry and 

1404
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,660
edible hemp products go to Canada and we
have ignored.

1405
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:12,920
That's potential for medicine.

1406
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,163
Well,
I'm really hoping that things are gonna 

1407
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,590
change in terms they will far 
cultivation hemp,

1408
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:18,803
you know,
I'm one of the owners of on it and we 

1409
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:21,484
sell hemp protein and one of the great.
We used to get our hemp protein from 

1410
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:25,750
Canada.
Yeah.

1411
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:28,420
We used to have to get it from Canada.
We sell it in America.

1412
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,160
We couldn't grow it here.
Stupid.

1413
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:33,400
Well that's going to change.
I'm so hopeful.

1414
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,660
It's good.
It does change.

1415
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:35,853
It is.
It's fascinating also how well the 

1416
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:40,024
propaganda worked against it.
And how long even defiance of all the 

1417
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,160
facts.
Now I have to tell you,

1418
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:45,994
when I did those pot explorers 1968,
I predicted that pop was going to be 

1419
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,240
legal in five years.
Boy,

1420
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:53,660
was I wrong.
I mean,

1421
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,200
I.
Oh,

1422
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,033
I thought,
I thought it was just a matter of 

1423
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:57,460
getting the truthful information out 
there.

1424
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:58,480
Well,
it wasn't.

1425
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,250
You know,
people believe what they want to believe

1426
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,260
and they don't believe what they don't 
want to believe in its root.

1427
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:03,700
It's totally irrational.
Well,

1428
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:08,701
it's also a really excellent example of 
the contradictions in our society.

1429
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:14,100
The difference between something that's 
accurate and something that's perceived.

1430
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:14,934
Yep.
And we have this perception of marrow 

1431
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:17,874
and,
and sometimes they have perceptions 

1432
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:22,450
based on experiences.
Like you might meet some really lazy,

1433
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:24,430
fucked up people smoke pot all the time 
and you go,

1434
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:25,810
oh,
this is what pot does to you.

1435
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,970
Also it was the associations of pot 
because back then you know,

1436
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:32,140
in the fifties,
sixties,

1437
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,440
it was associated with Mexican migrant 
workers with black jazz musicians in the

1438
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:42,340
south and then with radicals and hippy,
so all scary people to mainstream,

1439
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,980
you know,
middle class white society and of course

1440
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:46,923
all accentuated by William Randolph 
hearst and Harry anslinger and the 

1441
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:51,460
reefer madness films.

1442
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,120
Those are great.
They're great.

1443
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,003
Anybody hasn't seen those out there?
It's amazing how something that was 

1444
01:06:57,551 --> 01:06:58,384
terrifying to someone back then is so 
silly today when you watch the reefer 

1445
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:02,824
madness to.
It's really funny and at the same time 

1446
01:07:05,081 --> 01:07:05,914
we're living with the two most dangerous
drugs that are out there with alcohol 

1447
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:10,270
and tobacco.
Well,

1448
01:07:10,271 --> 01:07:11,104
how about fentanyl?
That one's cute shit out of me to just 

1449
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,180
keep wrapping that one up and making it 
more and more potent.

1450
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:17,014
Yeah,
just the idea that opioids weren't 

1451
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:20,104
killing people quick enough that we 
needed to make some ridiculously potent 

1452
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:24,394
versions of it and apparently now 
there's they're approving something 

1453
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:30,670
that's even more powerful like,
but why would you do that?

1454
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,920
But you know,
on a physiological level,

1455
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:37,921
opioids are not that bad for your body.
The worst effect of being addicted to an

1456
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:42,850
opioid overtime is chronic constipation.

1457
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:43,953
I mean that's annoying,
but that's not like cirrhosis of the 

1458
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:48,640
liver degeneration of the nervous 
system,

1459
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,680
but overdoses,
overdoses,

1460
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:51,514
of course,
that kills me by stopping your 

1461
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:53,074
respiration,
but there are many examples of people 

1462
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:59,260
who have been addicted to opioids who 
have been able to get legal supplies and

1463
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:02,170
he used them extensively.
They're healthy.

1464
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,393
I've heard about that when in terms of 
regular heroin use that I had a friend 

1465
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:10,450
who was a Longshoreman,
and this is like when I was a kid,

1466
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:11,284
he was explaining to me how this guy 
that he worked with would get a bag of 

1467
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:16,190
heroin every day at lunch

1468
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,353
and he would shoot it in his car and he 
would just sit in his car during lunch 

1469
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,010
hour and then when the time was up you'd
go back to work.

1470
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:22,910
I was like,
what?

1471
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,700
He said he would do that everyday.
I'm like,

1472
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,360
she's going to be dead in a week.
No,

1473
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:27,890
no.
He knows that if he knows the other take

1474
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:29,810
care of himself.
Apparently he did.

1475
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,830
Apparently he would do it all the time.
Right.

1476
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,743
I guess find a new vein and figuring out
how to do it and not famous historical 

1477
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:38,850
example.
That's great.

1478
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,733
There was a man named William holstead 
who was a surgeon at Johns Hopkins 

1479
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,413
University in the early 19 hundreds.
He invented a local anesthesia and so 

1480
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:49,403
get a great guy.
He started using cocaine and injected 

1481
01:08:53,211 --> 01:08:56,000
self-injected cocaine and not a good 
thing,

1482
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:56,940
and his,
you know,

1483
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,900
his behavior got really bad,
not good,

1484
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,033
so at some point his group of his 
colleague kidnapped them and took them 

1485
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:06,590
on a yacht for several weeks and he came
back,

1486
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,453
supposedly cured,
had a long life as a very successful 

1487
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:14,310
productive surgeon,
and only after his death was it revealed

1488
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:15,144
that what had happened on that trip was 
that they had gotten them off cocaine 

1489
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:21,320
and onto intravenous morphine for the 
rest of his life.

1490
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,153
He was an intravenous morphine user.
Did Not in any way interfere with his 

1491
01:09:25,251 --> 01:09:28,130
health or productivity.
I would assume that if you're doing that

1492
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:28,964
every day,
you're going to run into issues with 

1493
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:31,520
your veins.
Well,

1494
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:32,840
yeah.
Presumably,

1495
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:34,770
you know,
he knew how to rotate around that,

1496
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,280
that I wouldn't want to do that,
but there it is.

1497
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:38,223
Oh,
but the point is that it's a whole 

1498
01:09:40,401 --> 01:09:44,510
different game from alcohol and tobacco.
Yeah,

1499
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,430
a whole a whole different game,
but all problems,

1500
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:48,740
it's the.
It's the social toxicity of it.

1501
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:49,574
It's that it's that people are buying 
illegal impure materials and overdosing 

1502
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,290
and so forth.
That's not the,

1503
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:57,124
uh,
the nate pharmacological nature of the 

1504
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,294
drug.
What's been disturbing to me as a 

1505
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:01,970
person,
as an observer,

1506
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:04,920
is watching people who get injured,
get hooked on it,

1507
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:08,300
get it particularly pills yet it seems 
that,

1508
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:08,960
uh,
my,

1509
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:09,793
my good friend Brendan,
he had his nose broken and he got his 

1510
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:15,050
nose fixed and they put him on pills and
before he knew it,

1511
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:17,180
he was taking those pills everyday for 
months and months and months.

1512
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,013
And his friends eventually just took him
out of his medicine cabinet and they 

1513
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,590
just made an intervention.
So,

1514
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:24,171
you know,
this is,

1515
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:25,220
I think the,
uh,

1516
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,054
the opioid crisis that we've got in this
country is a fabulous opportunity for 

1517
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:29,624
integrative medicine because the 
realization is that you cannot manage 

1518
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:33,734
chronic pain solely with use of opioids.
So there has to be individualized 

1519
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:41,930
integrative treatment that use,
uses different modalities.

1520
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,210
It could be everything from acupuncture,
yoga,

1521
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:46,070
mind body stuff,
diet,

1522
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,133
and that all has to be the state of 
Oregon a couple of years ago passed an 

1523
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:53,900
integrative pain management initiative 
saying that all pain,

1524
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:56,870
chronic pain management had to be 
integrated and they listed the different

1525
01:10:56,871 --> 01:10:58,820
modalities.
They left out mind body medicine,

1526
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:00,530
which to me is one of the most 
important.

1527
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,070
Yeah.
Mind body medicine though on any sort of

1528
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,860
report that seems like that's when like,
okay,

1529
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:07,694
what kind of.

1530
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,080
But look,
you know I studied.

1531
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:09,761
I'm with you.
Yeah.

1532
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:10,594
I studied hypnosis after I got out of my
medical training and one of the most 

1533
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:18,480
interesting courses I ever took.
There's a well known demonstration in,

1534
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:22,290
in the literature on hypnosis.
You can take a person deeply hidden.

1535
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,133
Pfizer's got good trans capacity,
touch them with a finger that you 

1536
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:27,174
represent to be a piece of hot metal and
they get a blister and you can take the 

1537
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:31,584
same person that touched him with a 
piece of hot metal and tell them it's 

1538
01:11:33,601 --> 01:11:35,820
cold and they don't get a blister.
Wait a minute.

1539
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:36,683
Well,
yes.

1540
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:40,590
Well known phenomenon.
This is actually if you ever seen this.

1541
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:41,490
Yes.
Real life.

1542
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:42,323
Yes.
So someone's taken a hot piece of metal 

1543
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,790
and convince someone that did not going 
to burn it.

1544
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,090
Don't burn close too,
by the way.

1545
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:49,200
That the Suntan stuff.

1546
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,063
How long do you touch them with it for?
You know enough in an ordinary person 

1547
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:53,880
that up.
I call bullshit.

1548
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,890
I call bullshit.
So we'll try it.

1549
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,410
Let's try it.
I'll get you under cook your hand.

1550
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,710
Yes.
It's like it's hot.

1551
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,630
If it's hot,
it's gonna fuck you up now.

1552
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,470
Well I think if it's held there long 
enough so like,

1553
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:09,090
like it's one of those things like the 
walking on coals to.

1554
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:09,924
Absolutely.
Which I've done a number of times I'm 

1555
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:12,860
sure,
but if it's cold,

1556
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,960
you know this then that coles are not a 
very good conductor of heat,

1557
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:19,080
which is why you don't Cook Bullshit 
because.

1558
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,520
Yes.
I'll tell you what my experience was I.

1559
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,483
The first time I tried it a,
I was with a group of maybe 40 people 

1560
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:31,950
and it was a standard length of the 
firework was about 12 feet.

1561
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,260
It was a hot fire was mosquito.

1562
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,560
It was in my yard in Tucson and the guy 
came in,

1563
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,394
it was early in the days of firewalking 
and he had this long for our thing to 

1564
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:44,430
get people ready.
Uh,

1565
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,503
I was not in the right mental state when
I did it and my experience was it felt 

1566
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:52,530
fucking hot and then it got to the end 
of it,

1567
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,610
the condensed down to a number of points
that really burned.

1568
01:12:56,611 --> 01:13:00,630
And I had listeners the next day and 
most people that have walked that night,

1569
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,150
it looked like they were not in the 
right mental state,

1570
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:06,360
but I saw a few people who strolled 
across it that looked.

1571
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:08,340
They were in some interesting altered 
state.

1572
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,830
So I wanted to try it again next time I 
did it,

1573
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:13,650
I shouldn't have done it.
I was with a guy who was a real jerk who

1574
01:13:13,651 --> 01:13:17,010
thought of himself as a self styled grew
small group.

1575
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:21,000
It was a shorter maybe eight foot cooler
bed of coals.

1576
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:25,080
And I got significant burns from that.
So like an annoying guru.

1577
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:28,880
So it's really annoying saying no idea 
what he was like,

1578
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:29,723
this guy's a jerk off and then you're 
getting annoyed so you're out of your 

1579
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:32,820
mindset.
Right?

1580
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:35,250
And I burned my feet so I said I'm not 
going to do this again.

1581
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:39,440
And then a friend of mine was doing some
intensive workshop with Tony Robbins and

1582
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,733
Christ and it was going to end the last 
day they were going to do try to set a 

1583
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:46,740
record for the longest firewalk done in 
America.

1584
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,870
So he wanted me to come up.
So I went up there,

1585
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:50,760
I thought I'm going to watch,
I'm not going to do it.

1586
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:51,803
So it was a 40 foot bed of coals and it 
was really odd and he had like a troupe 

1587
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:58,710
of African drummers and people are 
dancing and drumming.

1588
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:02,850
It was like midnight and people were 
getting in line to walk and I said,

1589
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:03,684
I'm not going to do this.
Not going to be by family self going up 

1590
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:06,084
there.
And I was right there and he taps me on 

1591
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:08,130
the shoulder and says,
you're ready.

1592
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:12,400
It felt like walking through crunchy 
croutons.

1593
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,250
There was no sensation of heat.
I walked slowly,

1594
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:18,760
I kind of wiggled my feet in the things 
and when I got to the end of it,

1595
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,073
I felt so high.
It was like I want to ask that I had 

1596
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:25,480
energy rushes through my body.
I had nothing on my feet,

1597
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,390
so on a much shorter,
cooler walk.

1598
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:32,500
Those coals conducted just fine,
and then this one,

1599
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:33,423
it's a mind body thing.
It's not about the conductivity of the 

1600
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,690
Tony Robbins hitting you with some for 
gazy coals hot.

1601
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:42,420
I mean you could barely get at the edge 
of the thing.

1602
01:14:42,421 --> 01:14:43,500
Men,
the heat was amazing.

1603
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,373
He know the Tony Robbins one.
It's what's really interesting is 

1604
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:51,130
recently they've developed this issue 
with people trying to take selfies while

1605
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:53,440
they're walking across the coals,
burning their feet.

1606
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:54,933
It's become a significant issue because 
it didn't happen till like within the 

1607
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,320
last night.
Never heard of that.

1608
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,140
I think that would get you right out of 
the proper state.

1609
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:03,970
Yeah.
There was a big article about it.

1610
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:09,570
Article about these people really 
fucking their feet up well deserved.

1611
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:15,370
You really think that you have the 
ability to mitigate the amount of effect

1612
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:16,474
that fire and Cole hot coals.
I don't have any proof of this is my 

1613
01:15:19,991 --> 01:15:22,480
intuition.
I think what happens if your mind is out

1614
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:23,314
of the way you can take,
you can absorb energy and let it flow 

1615
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:28,924
through your body rather than getting 
blocked in the tissues where it causes 

1616
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:33,034
damage.
And I've seen this in other situations 

1617
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:35,944
as well and I think the problem is 
ordinarily our mind is in the way of 

1618
01:15:39,071 --> 01:15:41,680
that and does not let the body freely do
that.

1619
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,540
And I think that applies to things like 
getting hit really hard,

1620
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,240
uh,
heat getting hit really hard.

1621
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,074
How,
what do you mean?

1622
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:51,813
Getting,
letting someone hit you as hard as they 

1623
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:55,960
can with something that would cause 
damage and that doesn't.

1624
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,070
Oh,
that's crazy.

1625
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:57,941
No,
it's not.

1626
01:15:57,941 --> 01:15:59,540
I've experienced it.
Yeah,

1627
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,593
I'm sure you have.
But are there other real scientific 

1628
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:04,030
studies that show that nobody's studied 
it?

1629
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:06,350
I'd love to study.
Nobody's studied firewalking,

1630
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,233
you know,
the usual scientific explanations like 

1631
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,543
we probably shouldn't talk about this 
until they do do studies because it 

1632
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:15,100
seems so simple to do these studies and 
I'm not fighting for a second.

1633
01:16:15,101 --> 01:16:17,680
I think if I hit somebody,
they're going to fucking hurt.

1634
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,650
Right?
If you get deontay wilder to punch you,

1635
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:21,484
I don't give a fuck how much Tony 
Robbins talks to you and common 

1636
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:24,994
experience.
A drunk involved in car accidents don't 

1637
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:29,380
get injured.
Okay,

1638
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:31,720
but do you know why?
Because they're totally relaxed.

1639
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:32,554
Yes,
but that has nothing to do at some 

1640
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:34,504
altered state of consciousness is not 
allowing the injury to actually map out 

1641
01:16:37,811 --> 01:16:40,090
of the way and their body is totally 
relaxed,

1642
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:42,880
so that's the tension of falling you.

1643
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,880
You hurt yourself because you're 
defending yourself.

1644
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:47,630
You're right,
right you.

1645
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,473
Your body is better off giving in to the
old saying it's the same thing with the 

1646
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:53,860
fire,
but it can't be.

1647
01:16:53,861 --> 01:16:55,650
That's a different thing because you're 
not.

1648
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:56,943
It's on the surface of your skin,
which is causing the heat tense in your 

1649
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:02,014
nervous system,
which is not letting not able to absorb 

1650
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:06,790
that thermal energy and Brown.
We're going to do studies.

1651
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:11,210
Burn you anytime.
We'll try it,

1652
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,760
buy it.
It just.

1653
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:18,650
I think there's certainly you can 
mitigate the sensation of pain.

1654
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:23,330
I don't believe that you can do anything
about the actual physiological change to

1655
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:27,020
a hot piece of metal interacting with 
the tissue of your skin.

1656
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:30,530
I just think that like the steak does 
not know it's being cooked.

1657
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:33,050
It's just getting cooked.
You're going to get cooked.

1658
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:34,940
You are a meat.
I just don't.

1659
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,773
I don't buy that.
I'll show you some of these studies on 

1660
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:39,650
hypnosis.
There's doctors right now going,

1661
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:41,510
yes.
You tell them Joe Rogan.

1662
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,910
This is nonsense.
Well,

1663
01:17:43,911 --> 01:17:46,010
I believe hypnosis.
I do believe that,

1664
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:46,844
but I.
I absolutely believe you can achieve 

1665
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:51,860
different states of mind where you feel 
things differently.

1666
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:54,080
Your,
your concentration,

1667
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,980
your relaxation is in a different state.
Your mind set is in a different state.

1668
01:17:58,130 --> 01:17:58,963
I do not believe that you can change the
physiological nature of your body's 

1669
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:05,030
ability to absorb punishment like a 
punch or kick.

1670
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,240
I do that same thing of absorbing the 
sun.

1671
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,070
Let's set some studies up.
Sorry.

1672
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,210
How are we going to make these tests?
I don't know.

1673
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:15,280
I'll have to figure it out.
We'll talk.

1674
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,350
If they're doing this forever.
How do you not know?

1675
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,203
This should be.
You should have these studies already 

1676
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:22,710
done.
I want to talk about these things to do.

1677
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,593
I know,
but this is a significant icon rotation 

1678
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:26,383
point because if it's proven,
this is really huge and if you could 

1679
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:29,774
really take off hot metal rod that right
out of the fire and touch someone's 

1680
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:34,430
skin,
they're in the right state of mind.

1681
01:18:34,431 --> 01:18:37,220
You don't burn them.
That would be giant.

1682
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,770
Yes.
I am coming here with you.

1683
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:43,350
I'll send you some literature on 
hypnosis that shows this kind of.

1684
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,860
I'm sure that someone wrote some shit 
down.

1685
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:48,920
I'm sure I want to see actual real 
studies.

1686
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:51,290
I want to see and I want to.
I mean in this day and age,

1687
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:54,110
there's no reason not videotape,
but it's true.

1688
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:54,970
Come on.
All right,

1689
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:59,320
so a lot of stuff to do.
This is a big one though because this is

1690
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:00,163
something that will will people,
right healers and you know a lot a lot 

1691
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:08,550
of people like to bring up and when you 
press them on it there's no evidence for

1692
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:11,000
it and it's like,
well anecdotal evidence.

1693
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,833
Well I've heard,
well I work with a healer and he tells 

1694
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:15,080
me like,
okay,

1695
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:19,390
do you know what the literal meaning of 
anecdote is?

1696
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:21,770
No.
It means unpublished in Greek.

1697
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,070
It does not mean stupid,
not worth paying attention to.

1698
01:19:25,071 --> 01:19:27,410
Anecdotal evidence is often actually so 
and it.

1699
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,810
And it inspires you to do the 
experiments.

1700
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:30,644
So will you go ahead and do that?
I'll report that hot piece of metal on 

1701
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,380
your report back.
Yeah.

1702
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,710
And I'm going to go look at that burn.
I'll report back to you.

1703
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:40,603
Yeah.
I mean I'm not saying that anecdotal 

1704
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:45,680
evidence is always inaccurate.
It's most certainly accurate many times.

1705
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,820
Sometimes.
Sometimes.

1706
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:47,683
Yeah.
Just his likelihood that it's not that 

1707
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:52,490
it is,
but anecdotal enough is what gives you a

1708
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:54,110
hypothesis test.
Sure.

1709
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,973
But it's just not good enough to stay,
especially when something that doesn't 

1710
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:01,190
make sense chemically.
Physiologically.

1711
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:01,450
Alright.

1712
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:02,283
It doesn't make sense.
But I told you about my experience with 

1713
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,860
Sun Tan that.
Does that make sense?

1714
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:09,050
It the Europe trip and your balls off 
and.

1715
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,040
Yeah.
And something happened in my body.

1716
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:15,360
That would be interesting if that was 
some sort of interchange and your body's

1717
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:17,120
ability to produce melanin.
Yeah.

1718
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,560
Or what is it?
Melancholy.

1719
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,433
It's,
how do you say?

1720
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,330
Atlanta,
Atlanta sites sites.

1721
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:26,900
So your and they're controlled.
They're sites are related to neurons and

1722
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,450
they're.
They're influenced by nerve connection.

1723
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:32,284
So it seems to be perfectly possible 
that mind through the nervous system 

1724
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:36,114
changes the behavior Mylanta sites.
Sort of like how your body can ramp up 

1725
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:44,420
adrenaline or anxiety or any also can 
ramp up melana sites.

1726
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,323
Yeah.
That doesn't seem like outside of the 

1727
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:49,650
realm of possibility.
That seems like obviously some people.

1728
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:50,484
When I first told it to you,
you said it was outside the realm of 

1729
01:20:52,141 --> 01:20:52,830
possibility.

1730
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,570
Not outside,
but sounds crazy.

1731
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:55,863
Definitely sounds crazy.
But I mean it seems like that would be 

1732
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:00,210
something also that would really warrant
study.

1733
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,073
Absolutely,
especially those poor pastey ass 

1734
01:21:02,641 --> 01:21:07,260
motherfuckers out there on the beach 
turning bright red like,

1735
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:08,760
come man,
you just got to think about it the right

1736
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:09,594
way.
You imagine if you just told people it 

1737
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,610
was like a meditation and then you just 
get a nice Tan.

1738
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,230
Yeah,
good thing.

1739
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,873
It would be a good thing.
Now when it comes to like we were 

1740
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:22,290
talking about autoimmune issues.
Like I,

1741
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:23,580
I have video,
I go,

1742
01:21:23,581 --> 01:21:27,180
you see spots on my hands where I don't 
get any pigment.

1743
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,040
How do I fix that?
Fix that.

1744
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:30,930
My brain,
you know,

1745
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:31,764
all I can tell you is I would try to see
if you an influence through hypnosis or 

1746
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:37,950
through guided imagery to see if you can
change it in any way.

1747
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,020
I don't know.
Hypnosis and guided imagery.

1748
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,090
Yeah.
There are two mind body techniques.

1749
01:21:42,091 --> 01:21:47,091
I think it's worth trying.
I did read once that there was this,

1750
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,773
I think it was a young man who had some 
awful one of those awful war diseases 

1751
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,153
and there was one called theosis,
which is like the whole covered with 

1752
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:02,940
this callous,
tarred tissue and it went away.

1753
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,350
Hit Moses.
Yes.

1754
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:06,660
Yeah.
Over time I burned that case too.

1755
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,583
They told him that like his arm,
that one arm was going to be cured and 

1756
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:13,740
it just like,
I remember that lately.

1757
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:16,350
Eliminated all the warts on that one.
I remember that.

1758
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:17,633
Yeah.
And they couldn't figure out how or why 

1759
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,184
and they couldn't recreate it.
So the ward stuff that's very well 

1760
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:27,360
documented and work cures.
There's so many different work.

1761
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:28,800
Who are,
some of them are quite funny.

1762
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:29,730
Yeah.
Uh,

1763
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:30,563
you know,
you have to,

1764
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:31,850
you have to,
uh,

1765
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,093
uh,
a particular plant under the full moon 

1766
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:38,700
and Robin and barry above the falls off 
the next morning.

1767
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,300
And when you compare that to the way we 
deal with warts medically,

1768
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:43,830
we burned them off,
freeze them off,

1769
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:46,140
cut them off in most of the time when we
do that,

1770
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:48,980
they grow back and multiple clusters 
when they got,

1771
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,660
when the mind gets rid of them through 
this method,

1772
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,553
they're gone.
So we want to find out how to make that 

1773
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:55,920
happen more than fun.
Yeah,

1774
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:57,210
that's real,
right?

1775
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:59,890
I mean this is,
this is actual real documented science.

1776
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:04,350
That is what is so interesting to me 
about the placebo effect is that it is a

1777
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:05,184
real,
that your mind has this capability of 

1778
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:11,140
healing itself in this very,
very powerful way,

1779
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:13,990
but we don't exactly know how to turn it
on or off.

1780
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:16,660
Right?
And it can do the opposite too.

1781
01:23:16,661 --> 01:23:18,790
There's a phenomenon called Voodoo 
death.

1782
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,320
We're in societies where there which Dr 
Sherman's a malevolent,

1783
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:26,530
which Dr can curse a person and the 
person goes home,

1784
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:27,920
lies in bed,
stops eating,

1785
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,740
and over days or weeks dies will.

1786
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:34,540
So what more could you ask of in the way
of a mind body effect?

1787
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:35,374
Uh,
he put a curse on what was the 

1788
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,760
basketball team.
They were talking shit about them.

1789
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:43,870
Put a curse on them and they couldn't 
win a Goddamn game in a few times.

1790
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,870
Yeah,
he's put a curse on a few different to,

1791
01:23:45,871 --> 01:23:46,704
oh,
he's like a real,

1792
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:48,970
how would you say?
Spiritual.

1793
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:52,690
Very positive.
Mostly like real love oriented guy.

1794
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:56,500
But occasionally I'll put a hex on a 
dude and when he puts a hex on,

1795
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:57,334
you got a real problem on your heart.
Apparently it's been very effective and 

1796
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:04,580
people freak out when Lil B Hex Ism 
little b puts that hex on you,

1797
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,423
like dammit.
And then he releases the Hex is lifted 

1798
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:09,120
them.
He lifts the Huh.

1799
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:11,770
And when he lifts them,
everything goes back to normal.

1800
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:13,360
All right.
This is weird,

1801
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:14,194
man.
This is like a weird because everyone's 

1802
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:19,700
aware when he puts a curse on you and 
when,

1803
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:21,250
when he does,
people are gone.

1804
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,140
No,
I can't believe this.

1805
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,620
Like the idea of curses like a,
the,

1806
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,560
the Voodoo curse or a gypsy curse on 
you.

1807
01:24:29,561 --> 01:24:30,394
That is a.
well that's the negative side effects 

1808
01:24:31,741 --> 01:24:34,120
that it has a name.
It's called the no cbo effect.

1809
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,240
Noxious rather than pleasing.
Yeah.

1810
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,660
That is um,
that's a documented thing as well,

1811
01:24:40,661 --> 01:24:41,494
right?
That people can believe that something 

1812
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:45,030
is wrong with them.
And then they start mine.

1813
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,273
Yeah.
Fucking themselves into this terrible 

1814
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:50,200
state.
And then they start screwing things up.

1815
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,170
Yeah,
yeah,

1816
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,570
yeah.
Hot started.

1817
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,220
Here it is.
Kevin Duran says,

1818
01:24:54,221 --> 01:24:57,020
I tried to listen to little b.
my mind wouldn't let me do it.

1819
01:24:57,021 --> 01:25:00,770
I can't believe this guy's relevant.
Was like,

1820
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:01,723
okay bitch.
Kevin Durant will never win the title 

1821
01:25:04,061 --> 01:25:07,360
after he said Lil B as a whack wrapper,
the base,

1822
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:10,000
God's curse,
Hashtag the base.

1823
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:15,001
God's curse on direct and then he always
signs his tweets will be funny,

1824
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:19,810
but it works.
It works.

1825
01:25:19,811 --> 01:25:20,644
Kevin Doran is sitting at home right now
thinking of the millions that must have 

1826
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:23,633
cost is one now one now.
But he could have bought a house with 

1827
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:31,330
all that money lost those years.
A little be fucked over in a corner.

1828
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,130
But that.
I mean,

1829
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,310
I think the opposite is true too.
So somebody could put blessings on you.

1830
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:41,980
Like there was a fighter that we had in 
here the other day,

1831
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:44,350
deontay wilder,
he's the WBC heavyweight champion of the

1832
01:25:44,351 --> 01:25:45,184
world.
And he said that from the time he was a 

1833
01:25:47,111 --> 01:25:47,944
little boy,
his grandmother had him convinced that 

1834
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:50,464
he was like an anointed one,
that he was special and that she would 

1835
01:25:53,321 --> 01:25:55,570
always say that to his parents like,
you know,

1836
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:57,970
don't you hit him like this one's 
special,

1837
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:58,931
you know,
he's gonna,

1838
01:25:58,931 --> 01:26:01,990
raise everybody up.
And then he turned out to be like one of

1839
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:04,340
the greatest heavyweight champions ever 
in terms of like his record.

1840
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:05,174
He's 40 now with 39 knockouts and he's a
phenomenally successful fighter and in 

1841
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:10,154
his mind he believes that he has some 
like magic property or that there's 

1842
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:18,080
something to him.
He's a ridiculous knockout artist to me.

1843
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:21,110
Obviously there's a lot of physiological
aspects of that and he's a big,

1844
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:24,140
long,
tall guy with crazy knockout power.

1845
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:26,450
You can't fake power.
You either have it or you don't,

1846
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:30,260
but he's got it and he's got this weird 
confidence too.

1847
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:31,094
And you gotta wonder how much of them 
actually is operating under this idea 

1848
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:38,160
that his grandmother was right about him
having some magical properties.

1849
01:26:38,161 --> 01:26:40,070
And so he goes through life that this 
vision.

1850
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:41,840
Yeah.
Powerful.

1851
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:42,733
Yeah.
How you trick people into thinking that 

1852
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:45,314
way.
The whole nation full of a dlt while 

1853
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:49,843
there's a nation full of doctors are 
afraid of the placebo effect because 

1854
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:56,780
they think it's tricking people,
keeping them.

1855
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:59,690
And it's not.
It's like it's you know when,

1856
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:02,120
when you present a treatment to a 
patient,

1857
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:07,970
your belief in the treatment as a,
as a practitioner catalyzes the patients

1858
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:08,873
believe the best way I can do that as if
I give a patient something that I've 

1859
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:12,914
tried myself and I know from my own 
experience that it works and then I can 

1860
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:16,904
present it in a way with my confidence 
and that increases the patient's 

1861
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:22,460
confidence and increases the likelihood 
of a favorable outcome.

1862
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,430
Even controversial therapies.
Yes,

1863
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:26,264
and even Wayne example,
something you see when you give a 

1864
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,390
pharmaceutical drug to a patient,
I think there's,

1865
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:36,260
there's the direct effect of the drug 
and then there's a halo of belief effect

1866
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:37,483
and you know,
an interesting phenomenon is that 

1867
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:40,003
there's a famous saying in medicine that
you should use a new remedy as much as 

1868
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,500
possible before it loses the power to 
heal.

1869
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:46,783
And this is a common experience that 
drugs work best near the time of their 

1870
01:27:49,701 --> 01:27:52,150
introduction.
That's also the case with diets as well.

1871
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,200
Absolutely,
and the longer they're around,

1872
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:58,130
what I think what happens is people have
faith in new things,

1873
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:03,530
so there's a big halo of placebo effect 
over time that shrinks and it leaves the

1874
01:28:03,531 --> 01:28:05,660
stuff on its own which may not be very 
impressive.

1875
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:06,494
This is often the case when people take 
on a radical diet like on opposite ends 

1876
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:10,484
of the spectrum,
whether it's a carnivore diet and aware 

1877
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:16,820
that a lot of people swear it fixed 
Somalis Ales or Vegan Diet.

1878
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,430
Very similar effects,
obviously very different diet.

1879
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:22,280
Exactly,
so it's the mind.

1880
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:25,970
The mind to mind is where it's at,
how do we,

1881
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:27,163
how do we end?
The big problem in science and medicine 

1882
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:30,920
is that we don't believe in the mind.
No,

1883
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,140
that's what I was saying earlier when 
you were talking about mine.

1884
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,250
It's not material.
It's not.

1885
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,060
That's the problem when you're talking 
about mind,

1886
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:41,660
body interactions or work curious 
placebo effects,

1887
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,733
you're talking about a an nonmaterial 
cause of a physical event and that is 

1888
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:51,560
not allowed in the materialistic 
paradigm that science,

1889
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,710
when we observed a change in the 
physical system,

1890
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:59,950
the dog is the cause has to be physical.
When you talk about a nonphysical causes

1891
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,820
a physical event,
scientists to now,

1892
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,023
well that's really unfortunate because 
we know so much about how attitude does 

1893
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:09,270
shape the way your body reacts to 
things.

1894
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,890
Going back to the SAR,
no stuff,

1895
01:29:10,891 --> 01:29:14,370
you know that with back pain,
all that stuff.

1896
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:18,780
It's like you know that to me that the.
You can't separate the mind and body.

1897
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:21,480
There are two poles of the same thing.
Well,

1898
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:24,120
if the placebo effect is real and it's 
documented,

1899
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,373
it's documented,
so obviously something is going on with 

1900
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:28,344
the way you feel about things and think 
about things that it's having an actual 

1901
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:33,540
physiological effects.
There's something happening to your body

1902
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:35,760
because the way you're thinking about 
are happening to your body.

1903
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,623
Now,
one of the things that has made this 

1904
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,053
suddenly have interest in the medical 
world is that we now have these 

1905
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:46,200
techniques like functional Mris,
pet scans,

1906
01:29:46,201 --> 01:29:47,034
where we can observe living brains and 
you can show that the placebo response 

1907
01:29:50,811 --> 01:29:51,644
is associated with particular activity 
in certain brain centers that has made 

1908
01:29:54,421 --> 01:29:57,450
it real for people that otherwise didn't
believe in it.

1909
01:29:58,830 --> 01:29:59,850
Yes,
right?

1910
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,713
Like there's a medically documented.
There's something they actually get a 

1911
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,140
hook into.
Yeah,

1912
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,630
you can.
You can put it on a scale.

1913
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,471
Yes,
exactly.

1914
01:30:07,471 --> 01:30:08,304
Yeah.
What part of the brain is responsible 

1915
01:30:10,261 --> 01:30:11,640
for the placebo effect?
Well,

1916
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:12,474
again,
it's probably some of these deep brain 

1917
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:18,480
centers that the same ones involved in 
Sweden and wearing the same thing.

1918
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:23,130
It's coming from centers that connect to
emotional read to emotion.

1919
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,093
Yeah.
The ability to turn that on off 

1920
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,490
consciously and willingly.
This is tricky.

1921
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,540
Yeah.
You know,

1922
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,374
another thing I looked at over the years
was healing shrines in the world like 

1923
01:30:35,581 --> 01:30:36,414
Lord the.
There's two interesting facts about 

1924
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:40,980
that.
Over the years,

1925
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:41,814
the Catholic Church has accepted very 
few healings as genuine that or have 

1926
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:48,540
full medical documentation and some of 
them are quite spectacular,

1927
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:52,470
like miraculous disappearance of widely 
disseminated cancer.

1928
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:53,873
No native of Lord has ever been cured 
and the chances that a person that's 

1929
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,700
going to be healed there explained,
Lord,

1930
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,580
this is a place as a place in France 
where you know,

1931
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,670
a,
a,

1932
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,471
a,
you know,

1933
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:08,180
a child saw visions of the Virgin Mary 
and anyway,

1934
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,260
growing up into a,
there's a grotto and you know,

1935
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,273
it's now a major Catholic drawing and it
has a reputation for healing and 

1936
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:18,420
thousands and thousands of people over 
the years of going there.

1937
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:19,860
So as I said,
very,

1938
01:31:19,861 --> 01:31:20,694
you know,
there was relatively few reported 

1939
01:31:22,951 --> 01:31:25,200
healings that had been docked,
fully document medically,

1940
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:27,630
but no native of Lord has ever been 
healed.

1941
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:28,763
And the,
there's something called the Lord 

1942
01:31:30,391 --> 01:31:31,224
phenomenon,
which is fascinating that the chances 

1943
01:31:33,091 --> 01:31:33,924
that a person is going to be healed at 
Lord or a place like that is directly 

1944
01:31:37,261 --> 01:31:39,390
proportional to the length of the 
journey traveled.

1945
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,700
Yeah,
I have heard that.

1946
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:45,300
So the length of the journey is,
is an investment of belief,

1947
01:31:45,301 --> 01:31:46,134
right?
So you're projecting belief onto the 

1948
01:31:47,431 --> 01:31:49,920
plate place and then you get it back.
Yeah.

1949
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:53,340
That that seems like that could 
essentially work with any very,

1950
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,174
very difficult absolution,
quest types of experience that you're 

1951
01:31:56,971 --> 01:31:57,804
going on.
You're looking for something and you 

1952
01:31:59,201 --> 01:31:59,980
have to earn it.

1953
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,650
Yeah.
And you have to be fully invested.

1954
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,543
There has to be something going on in 
the mind that has you convinced this is 

1955
01:32:05,441 --> 01:32:08,560
a real effect,
but the power is not in the place.

1956
01:32:08,561 --> 01:32:13,210
The powers in here and you're projecting
it onto that.

1957
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,580
But man wouldn't be better if you didn't
have to go all the way.

1958
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,640
That'd be great.
And how do you,

1959
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:23,110
how do you get that going?
Like if someone said to you,

1960
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:24,520
okay man,
I don't want to go to the Lord,

1961
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:25,200
but uh,
what,

1962
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,980
what should I do?
Well,

1963
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,320
one is the acute.
Imagine you're going to Lord in.

1964
01:32:29,321 --> 01:32:31,690
That's taking advantage of this function
of visualization.

1965
01:32:31,691 --> 01:32:32,524
That's why these therapies like guided 
imagery seem to work that you can 

1966
01:32:34,871 --> 01:32:38,770
imagine something and have it become 
real guided imagery.

1967
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,360
Now is there a specific,
you know,

1968
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:42,490
like there's like transcendental 
medication.

1969
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:44,110
There's boots,
a formal,

1970
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:46,780
it's a formal system of therapy that 
people are trained in.

1971
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:47,800
Were you,
uh,

1972
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:48,693
you know,
you sit with a practitioner and they 

1973
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:51,123
help you explore your mental imagery and
a May give you specific kinds of images 

1974
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:58,510
to work with depending on the condition 
that you're dealing with.

1975
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:04,270
I would think knowing the fact that we 
were,

1976
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:06,550
we have real evidence that placebo 
effect works.

1977
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:11,230
Why isn't there more study done to try 
or more thought and more,

1978
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:12,723
more people that are trying to emphasize
disability of the talent and we're up 

1979
01:33:17,021 --> 01:33:17,854
against this problem that in the 
dominant paradigm in science and 

1980
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:21,874
medicine,
we don't believe in nonphysical 

1981
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:27,250
causation of physical events,
but that doesn't jive with me because we

1982
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:29,740
do believe in a placebo effect.
Like everybody says that,

1983
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,000
oh,
it's just a placebo.

1984
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,260
Right?
You said that earlier.

1985
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,660
People always say that,
but it still works.

1986
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,680
Right?
But,

1987
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,560
but we're not using it.
Right.

1988
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:39,880
We should be using.
It should be used.

1989
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:40,883
It's the meat of medicine.
We want to make it happen more at the 

1990
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:45,290
time.
God Damn it.

1991
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,280
It's just,
we're so flawed in our approach.

1992
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:49,114
It's really interesting.
It's like the human body and the human 

1993
01:33:51,821 --> 01:33:56,410
mind is such an incredibly complicated 
biological entity,

1994
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:57,040
right?

1995
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,920
Our ability to consciously be aware of 
our,

1996
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:01,930
our,
our life,

1997
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:05,440
our position in the world,
our mortality,

1998
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:08,260
the insignificance of us in the greater 
scale.

1999
01:34:08,261 --> 01:34:11,500
All those things are like they are right
now all the time,

2000
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:14,160
but you don't have any users manually.
Exactly.

2001
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,003
We have this incredible machine that can
invent nuclear bombs and satellites and 

2002
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,863
there's no union users manual,
no user's manual for the mind or the 

2003
01:34:22,631 --> 01:34:25,330
body,
especially not in how to manage the body

2004
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:27,820
with the mind.
Nothing figured out,

2005
01:34:27,821 --> 01:34:30,700
bitch wide open on your own because few 
people have got it.

2006
01:34:30,701 --> 01:34:32,350
You got to like find these masters.
Right?

2007
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:33,184
So if you think about the 300 and 
whatever million people we have in this 

2008
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:39,190
country,
how many of those people could guide you

2009
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,383
towards a,
a proper integration of mind and body 

2010
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,583
and a positive way of interfacing with 
reality that's beneficial to you 

2011
01:34:49,091 --> 01:34:50,860
physically,
mentally,

2012
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:53,510
spiritually,
not many.

2013
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:55,960
Is there a dozen?
Not many.

2014
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,003
Isn't it interesting with all these 
human beings and essentially most of 

2015
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:06,110
them trying to improve in some way,
even people that fail on diets,

2016
01:35:06,111 --> 01:35:09,350
but they'd like to get skinny?
Even people that fail at school,

2017
01:35:09,351 --> 01:35:11,000
while I wish I was smart enough to 
graduate,

2018
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:14,300
I wish I had enough discipline people 
people want to do better,

2019
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:15,493
so there's this vast need for coaching 
that would lead to improvement yet 

2020
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:25,030
almost mean nothing to speak of and 
certainly not nothing large scale in any

2021
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:28,760
city that has this approach where,
look,

2022
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:29,603
we're going to teach you how to better 
engage with the material world around 

2023
01:35:35,331 --> 01:35:38,510
you and the better engage with reality 
itself.

2024
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:41,060
That's going to leave you a more 
spiritually,

2025
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:43,490
physically,
emotionally fulfilled like that.

2026
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,380
It seems like that'll be a big business.
It would go.

2027
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:50,020
One way to teach this stuff is by 
example that if a person exemplifies,

2028
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:51,700
you know,
good mind,

2029
01:35:51,701 --> 01:35:54,320
body functioning,
they can inspire that and another person

2030
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:57,890
that seems like maybe the only way,
one strategy that I.

2031
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:00,170
If I can do this,
if I have a patient,

2032
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:04,610
if I can introduce that patient to 
someone who's had their condition is now

2033
01:36:04,611 --> 01:36:05,444
better,
that is a very powerful way to up their 

2034
01:36:08,871 --> 01:36:10,460
belief in the possibility of getting 
better.

2035
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,780
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2036
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:14,420
Which is why people love user 
testimonials.

2037
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,730
Right.
But,

2038
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,640
but better if you actually meet the 
person and show see for yourself,

2039
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,340
but use your testimonials are so huge 
for that.

2040
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:23,001
Raise your right.
You know,

2041
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:23,834
I was skeptical at first,
but then I tried it and boy he was 

2042
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:31,991
skeptical just like me.
It to me when I look at the giant number

2043
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:35,474
of people that are unhappy and displaced
and just seem like they're left out of 

2044
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:42,680
society.
I was listening to.

2045
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:43,603
Oh,
it was Johann Hari on Sam Harris' 

2046
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,633
podcast.
They were talking about the number of 

2047
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:53,840
people that are happy with what they do 
for a living.

2048
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,183
Happy with what they do every day.
And it was somewhere around 13 percent 

2049
01:36:57,881 --> 01:36:59,450
and long.
Yeah.

2050
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,480
And then the number of people that were 
just like,

2051
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:03,950
it's okay.
I just do it.

2052
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:05,180
Like,
I don't hate it,

2053
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:08,510
but I don't love it.
That was like in the 60 percent and then

2054
01:37:08,511 --> 01:37:11,450
the rest of the people fucking hated 
what they did.

2055
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:16,580
So the vast majority,
some ungodly number,

2056
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:17,443
you know,
like 87 percent of people hate what 

2057
01:37:20,061 --> 01:37:20,870
they're doing.
Oh,

2058
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:23,000
how sad.
Or if don't hate it,

2059
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:25,640
they don't want to be doing it and they 
do it all the time.

2060
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,830
Yeah.
That's crazy that,

2061
01:37:27,831 --> 01:37:32,540
that has to have a profound effect on 
all aspects of your life.

2062
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,374
Right.
I like what I do when you seem like you 

2063
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:36,253
do,
you have a twinkle in your eye when you 

2064
01:37:37,461 --> 01:37:38,294
talk about it,
but I mean it's got to give you some 

2065
01:37:41,241 --> 01:37:42,380
satisfaction for sure.

2066
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:43,100
Right.
Yeah.

2067
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,630
Help all these people.
Absolutely.

2068
01:37:44,631 --> 01:37:46,660
And also to see a lot of the things that
I've,

2069
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:47,494
uh,
you know,

2070
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,760
believed for so long,
becoming more mainstream.

2071
01:37:49,761 --> 01:37:50,720
It's good.
Yeah.

2072
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:54,710
And much more so now than ever before.
More so now than ever before.

2073
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,160
Yeah.
When you were doing those studies in the

2074
01:37:56,161 --> 01:37:56,994
19 sixties and you thought that 
marijuana is going to be legal in five 

2075
01:37:59,071 --> 01:38:01,050
years,
how could you have ever.

2076
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:01,943
First of all,
how could you have ever thought of the 

2077
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:03,751
Internet?
Right.

2078
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:05,910
That's the big thing.
The distortion of information.

2079
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,200
Sure.
Yeah.

2080
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,270
That's,
that's really the big one.

2081
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:12,130
The decentralized APP distribution of 
information,

2082
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:14,490
and that's by the way in medicine has 
really.

2083
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:15,324
It's one of the things that's most 
leveled the playing field between 

2084
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:20,790
doctors and patients sort of ended the 
authoritarian,

2085
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:24,450
paternalistic kind of medicine.
That was when I grew up.

2086
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:25,880
Well,
it's,

2087
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,180
it is a problem,
right?

2088
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:29,730
A patient comes.
They think they know everything.

2089
01:38:29,731 --> 01:38:31,230
Yeah.
But I had seen,

2090
01:38:31,231 --> 01:38:32,064
I have seen many,
many patients who have gotten exactly 

2091
01:38:34,471 --> 01:38:37,860
the information they needed and were 
able to take it to the doctor who didn't

2092
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:38,850
know about it.
I mean,

2093
01:38:38,851 --> 01:38:40,920
I think on the whole it's a really good 
thing.

2094
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:41,930
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2095
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,451
No,
no,

2096
01:38:42,451 --> 01:38:43,284
for sure.
I'm saying just like I get how doctors 

2097
01:38:44,821 --> 01:38:47,340
would be worn out by it all the time.
No less than I'm a,

2098
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,200
I went to school.
This is what it is.

2099
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:50,063
Well,
it's good for them to have to let go of 

2100
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:51,774
that.
Yeah.

2101
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,673
Well,
there's no way you could know 

2102
01:38:54,331 --> 01:38:55,260
everything.
True.

2103
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:56,173
And especially doctors,
they must know that they have a 

2104
01:38:57,841 --> 01:39:01,860
specialty for a reason because the human
body is so insanely complicated.

2105
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:02,963
There's no way anybody is a general 
specialist of every single aspect of 

2106
01:39:05,551 --> 01:39:07,350
medicine,
but we need more generalists.

2107
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,930
One of the problems that we've got too 
many specialists and there's.

2108
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,823
Yeah,
so someone like would you think of a 

2109
01:39:12,061 --> 01:39:15,210
generalist as someone who sort of guides
you towards various specialists?

2110
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:17,490
I'm a general practitioner and I'm very 
proud of it.

2111
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:21,660
There's good data showing that states 
that have a higher number of prime of,

2112
01:39:21,661 --> 01:39:24,540
of,
of a primary care physicians,

2113
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,433
family doctors have better medical 
outcomes than patients with a high 

2114
01:39:28,931 --> 01:39:30,740
percentage of specialists that the 
problem,

2115
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:34,290
some specialties pay more.
So we should be changing that.

2116
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:37,590
We should be providing financial 
incentives for people to go into general

2117
01:39:37,591 --> 01:39:38,580
medicine.
Yeah.

2118
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:41,070
Would also make sense to that.
By the time you get to a specialist,

2119
01:39:41,071 --> 01:39:43,110
usually you're really messed up.
Right?

2120
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:45,210
And if you're going to a back 
specialist,

2121
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:48,150
you might have like a real situation.
It's been bothering me for a long time.

2122
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:51,390
Whereas you go into a general 
practitioner for a checkup.

2123
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:56,090
This is my biannual checkup.
He just kind of giving you the once over

2124
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:58,800
making sure everything's okay.
How do you sleep and high eating,

2125
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:00,210
drinking,
smoking cigarettes,

2126
01:40:00,211 --> 01:40:03,050
what's going on?
Just get a sense of you,

2127
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,520
but they do they have enough.
Time is not a big issue.

2128
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:09,450
Like what time do you spend when you,
when you're working with patients?

2129
01:40:09,451 --> 01:40:14,451
I take an hour and in our clinics we do 
90 minutes on a first session.

2130
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:15,503
That's gotta be nice.
Ninety minutes you can get to know 

2131
01:40:16,951 --> 01:40:18,780
somebody,
but if you're getting in and out of that

2132
01:40:18,781 --> 01:40:21,420
office in 10 minutes he'd just,
here's a prescription.

2133
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:23,610
Get out of here next.
You know the,

2134
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:25,103
the has been studies on the amount of 
time in a medical encounter when a 

2135
01:40:29,611 --> 01:40:30,444
patient starts to talk,
how soon a doctor interrupts the 

2136
01:40:32,191 --> 01:40:35,130
patient.
Do you have any guess what that is now?

2137
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:36,540
Thirteen seconds.
You're right.

2138
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:37,381
Really?
Yeah,

2139
01:40:37,381 --> 01:40:38,214
13 seconds.
I used the same number of people that 

2140
01:40:40,921 --> 01:40:42,590
are happy with what they do.
Ha,

2141
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:45,000
there you go.
That's pretty good.

2142
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,220
Thirteen seconds.
Wow.

2143
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:48,850
Well,
on my.

2144
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:51,450
My foot hurts and I've been okay.
Here you go.

2145
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,990
Shut the fuck up.
You didn't take this.

2146
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:57,110
Take this opium.
Yeah.

2147
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:59,800
Have you ever eaten in a true food 
kitchen?

2148
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,600
What does that mean?
It's a restaurant.

2149
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,710
True food kitchen.
No,

2150
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:03,820
I don't know what that is.
Well,

2151
01:41:03,821 --> 01:41:06,600
it's a restaurant that I started and 
there's now 25 of them.

2152
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,773
He got two and two and out in La and one
in Pasadena where I'm going to go after 

2153
01:41:11,711 --> 01:41:14,550
the show and I'm in Pasedena tonight.
All right.

2154
01:41:14,551 --> 01:41:16,390
You want to go to a comedy club?
All right.

2155
01:41:16,391 --> 01:41:17,224
What time?
I'll be there for dinner if you want to 

2156
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:20,950
come over there.
True food kitchen.

2157
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:21,750
Yeah,
it's great.

2158
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:24,100
It's delicious.

2159
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:27,670
Healthy food.
It's wonderful food that conforms.

2160
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:28,504
The good nutritional principles.
It's anti inflammatory diet and there's 

2161
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:32,530
something for everyone.
There is like meat.

2162
01:41:32,531 --> 01:41:34,360
There's Vegan options,
vegetarian,

2163
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:36,100
gluten free.
It's very delicious.

2164
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:37,870
Food,
true food kitchen.

2165
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:40,720
It's become an incredibly successful 
restaurant concept.

2166
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:41,673
Well,
that's a great idea to be able to serve 

2167
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:43,864
people.
Things that you know for a fact are 

2168
01:41:45,101 --> 01:41:47,680
going to be healthy and nutritious.
Not just taste good,

2169
01:41:47,681 --> 01:41:49,180
but good for you.
Primarily.

2170
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:50,014
It's food that looks great and tastes 
great and happens to conform to good 

2171
01:41:52,601 --> 01:41:53,690
nutritional science.
Yeah.

2172
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:54,543
That is possible and that's a lot of 
people think you have to eat fried 

2173
01:41:56,561 --> 01:41:58,570
chicken and we'll come in there and try 
it.

2174
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,220
I would love to try it all right.
Definitely.

2175
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,193
How do you eat for the most part?
You said you eat fish and you eat 

2176
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:07,210
through the full.
I try to grow a lot of my own food.

2177
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:09,390
I love food,
fresh stuff out of the garden.

2178
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,340
I like to cook and I invent recipes 
which is,

2179
01:42:12,341 --> 01:42:13,174
you know,
a lot of the recipes and the restaurant 

2180
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:16,730
or mine a great.
So I,

2181
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:19,510
I like simple,
simple,

2182
01:42:19,511 --> 01:42:23,110
quick preparations that are really good.
Do you fast at all?

2183
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,513
I have been.
I've experimented with intermittent 

2184
01:42:25,451 --> 01:42:29,950
fasting and I haven't found a regimen 
that works exactly right for me,

2185
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:33,880
but I'm fascinated by it.
I do a 18 or 16 and eight.

2186
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:37,510
And how often do you do that?
I try to do it four days a week.

2187
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,860
Sometimes it's difficult when I travel.
Yeah.

2188
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:45,520
But uh,
even then I'm more accustomed to it than

2189
01:42:45,521 --> 01:42:49,750
ever before.
So if I eat dinner at 8:00

2190
01:42:49,751 --> 01:42:50,341
at night,
it's,

2191
01:42:50,341 --> 01:42:52,970
it's not hard to wait till she's back.
Okay.

2192
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,310
Yeah,
it's not hard.

2193
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:57,220
My body's just really used to it now.
How long have you been doing it?

2194
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:59,860
About a year or so.
Maybe a little bit more than that.

2195
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,140
Yeah.
I think that makes a lot of sense.

2196
01:43:02,141 --> 01:43:02,974
And uh,
continue to experiment with what I 

2197
01:43:05,591 --> 01:43:06,424
haven't done that I really have been 
thinking a lot about doing is doing a 

2198
01:43:08,951 --> 01:43:11,530
multiple day fast.
Just a water fast.

2199
01:43:11,531 --> 01:43:14,020
I've done that for the longest.
I've done it for three days.

2200
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:16,420
How was that?
The first day was difficult.

2201
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,150
Um,
or actually the second day was difficult

2202
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:20,500
the third day.
Fabulous.

2203
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:21,940
You know,
I felt energized.

2204
01:43:21,941 --> 01:43:23,800
Hi.
My mind working very clear.

2205
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:24,634
The problem that I have is how do you 
come off it because it's very easy to 

2206
01:43:29,021 --> 01:43:32,790
slide into eating pizza krispy Kreme to.

2207
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,070
Exactly.
Yeah.

2208
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,470
I think there's protocols in terms of 
like small amounts of fruit,

2209
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:39,304
right?
Like right when you're coming out of 

2210
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:41,980
blueberries,
which to me was.

2211
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:46,981
The tricky part was transitioning off it
go too fast with the buzzer.

2212
01:43:47,171 --> 01:43:50,170
Rang schools out for summer.
Yeah,

2213
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:51,093
I get it man.
I mean especially if you feel like you 

2214
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:54,740
earned it right,
you didn't eat for three days.

2215
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:55,720
You want that pizza.
Right.

2216
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,770
One of the things I found when I was 
doing it,

2217
01:43:57,771 --> 01:43:59,880
having a bowl of March,
I,

2218
01:43:59,881 --> 01:44:00,714
I normally my my pattern is I want to 
eat as soon as I get up so that those 

2219
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:06,610
morning hours are hard for me,
but if I have a,

2220
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:10,010
have my macho that helps.
Do you exercise?

2221
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:13,720
I do.
I swim mostly walk everyday.

2222
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:17,780
I find that once my body got used to 
fast to exercise,

2223
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:18,983
it became much,
much easier and it just became like 

2224
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:25,550
before I would almost have anxiety 
attached to it.

2225
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,500
Like God,
I can't work out without food.

2226
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,673
I have to eat.
And then when I started doing the 

2227
01:44:30,381 --> 01:44:33,500
intermittent fast and then I started 
doing fasted exercise,

2228
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:35,473
I think it was.
I'm sure I pr if you probably measured 

2229
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:40,244
me in terms of like a.
He did a bunch of like weight lifting 

2230
01:44:43,341 --> 01:44:44,174
exercises and measured my output.
I probably would be able to lift more 

2231
01:44:47,061 --> 01:44:47,894
weights if I had some fruit first.
I'm pretty sure I'd have a little bit 

2232
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:52,280
more energy,
probably measurable,

2233
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:53,293
but it's not difficult to have a 
vigorous workout in the morning when 

2234
01:44:56,841 --> 01:44:58,730
you're fasting.
You just kinda get used to it.

2235
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:03,830
And I often do either hot yoga or run 
first thing in the morning.

2236
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:06,980
Weight lifting seems to be a bit of an 
issue with weight lifting.

2237
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:07,814
I don't like.
I like to eat something before I lift 

2238
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:09,914
weights.
Huh?

2239
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,900
Yeah.
But swimming.

2240
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:15,320
But you ever fasted swim?
It's fine.

2241
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:19,010
No problem with it now.
Why don't you get off the pot?

2242
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:21,710
You know,
it changed for me in,

2243
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,673
in I,
I really used it regularly in my 

2244
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,900
twenties and thirties and when I first 
started using it,

2245
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,490
uh,
it was great.

2246
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:35,690
I mean it was like hilarious highs,
laughing a lot of them.

2247
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:40,080
Then it turned after several years more 
introspective and,

2248
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:44,000
and interesting.
I like creative writing for helping,

2249
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:44,834
writing,
stuff like that and then gradually 

2250
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:50,900
transitioned into making me groggy and 
not doing much for me.

2251
01:45:50,901 --> 01:45:52,300
And for,
you know,

2252
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,230
it took me a while to separate myself 
from it,

2253
01:45:54,231 --> 01:45:55,064
but in the last years of it it was 
groggy and sedated that I think I 

2254
01:45:57,831 --> 01:46:00,860
changed my body changed.
That's interesting.

2255
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:04,670
Have you ever tried different strains?
I have.

2256
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:07,010
First of all,
I don't like to smoke because I'm really

2257
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:09,520
into breathing and I just kept put smoke
in the oil.

2258
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:11,450
Right.
I've tried a vaping.

2259
01:46:11,451 --> 01:46:13,700
I don't,
I just don't like the effect of it these

2260
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:14,533
days.
Aping,

2261
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:16,240
I just don't like the effect,
you know,

2262
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,800
I don't like oral feels,
you know,

2263
01:46:18,801 --> 01:46:20,780
it's too strong for me.
Yeah.

2264
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:25,370
Well when you're talking about that half
of a half a grain of sand putting you on

2265
01:46:25,371 --> 01:46:30,371
Pluto for agreement sand that funny.
Imagine that at that would be like acid.

2266
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,240
Yeah,
it was.

2267
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,410
Felt like acid.
Yeah.

2268
01:46:33,411 --> 01:46:35,450
Well boy,
I'll tell you,

2269
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:37,220
um,
for me,

2270
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:38,143
the most profound and intense experience
I ever have in the sensory deprivation 

2271
01:46:41,631 --> 01:46:45,650
tank or edible marijuana.
Edible marijuana in that tank.

2272
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,570
That combination is just.
Whoa.

2273
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:51,440
Huh.
A real strong dose because you.

2274
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:53,130
Have you done the tank at all?
Yeah.

2275
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:55,080
But not with.
Not with pot.

2276
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:57,150
And psychedelics long time ago.
Yeah.

2277
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:58,103
Well even sober you have some pretty 
trippy experiences while you're in 

2278
01:47:00,661 --> 01:47:01,200
there.

2279
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:06,200
But there's something about the,
what I experienced with edible marijuana

2280
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,210
is that,
uh,

2281
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,220
when you close your eyes you get a lot 
of really cool visuals.

2282
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:14,790
Like I've had it before when I take pot 
and then get on a plane,

2283
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,650
like I'll,
I'll eat right.

2284
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:19,350
Right when I parked my car at the 
airport or when I'm leaving the house.

2285
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:20,880
Then it kicks in when you're on the 
plane.

2286
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,970
Like closing your eyes,
Huh?

2287
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:25,013
Something about closing your eyes.
The you have like really brightly 

2288
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:28,404
colored colored visuals oftentimes.
And I get that a lot inside the tank 

2289
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:35,290
with marijuana.
Huh?

2290
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:40,080
I had that with that real strong stuff.
I definitely had a lot of visual stuff.

2291
01:47:40,081 --> 01:47:41,250
Yeah.
That's what's weird about it.

2292
01:47:41,251 --> 01:47:43,680
Right?
It's like it does become a psychedelic.

2293
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,470
Yes.
Especially at high dose.

2294
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:50,790
Why are they making that stuff so 
strongly unnecessary when,

2295
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:52,800
how many milligrams did they say it was?

2296
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:57,450
I wasn't much because they've got these 
damn Chiba Chews.

2297
01:47:57,451 --> 01:48:01,110
They're like 500 milligrams for one 
little cake.

2298
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,880
One little thing like that bank,
500 milligrams,

2299
01:48:03,881 --> 01:48:08,380
like why do you need that?
Because you started out with 10 and then

2300
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:10,430
you worked your way up to $500.
I mean,

2301
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:13,110
I guess there's a tolerance issue which 
a lot of folks,

2302
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:13,944
right?
Yeah,

2303
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:17,040
yeah.
Do you,

2304
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:22,041
um,
do you regularly meditate or to do every

2305
01:48:23,191 --> 01:48:25,290
morning when I get up what kind of 
meditation?

2306
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:29,550
I first uh,
practices in and then I took some of the

2307
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:33,060
positive training and now I get up,
I sit down,

2308
01:48:33,061 --> 01:48:38,061
I do my breathing routine and then I 
just try to focus on body sensations and

2309
01:48:40,291 --> 01:48:45,291
the sounds in the room and when I'm 
caught up in my thoughts I just bring my

2310
01:48:45,751 --> 01:48:48,900
attention back to my breathing.
But,

2311
01:48:48,901 --> 01:48:49,561
you know,
for me,

2312
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:52,350
I think that the sitting sitting in 
meditation,

2313
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:53,340
that's fine.

2314
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:54,173
But I think the goal is to be able to 
carry that state and all of your 

2315
01:48:56,671 --> 01:48:58,780
activities.
Uh,

2316
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:02,850
so for me cooking is meditative,
chopping vegetables,

2317
01:49:02,851 --> 01:49:06,900
working with knives and uh,
that's very meditative for me.

2318
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:12,060
So when do you think that when you're 
having this meditation,

2319
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:14,250
whether it's Zen or whatever,
that your,

2320
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:19,290
you're resetting the way you're gonna go
through life for the rest of the day.

2321
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:20,363
Hopefully that's the goal is to carry 
that state throughout the day where you 

2322
01:49:25,771 --> 01:49:28,710
kind of have a responsibility.
Don't you agree?

2323
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:32,850
Like your guy who's teaching people how 
to live a more productive,

2324
01:49:32,851 --> 01:49:33,421
healthier,
live.

2325
01:49:33,421 --> 01:49:35,430
You kind of have a responsibility to 
live your own productive,

2326
01:49:35,431 --> 01:49:36,360
healthy,
live better.

2327
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:37,194
Right.
I wouldn't feel right doing that if I 

2328
01:49:38,431 --> 01:49:40,260
didn't practice it more slippery.
Right?

2329
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:42,930
Yeah.
But I don't tell people to do things.

2330
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:47,100
I don't do it myself.
When you have some thoughts about things

2331
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:47,943
like something like a Boga,
would you be interested in trying it 

2332
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:50,070
yourself?

2333
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,903
Sure.
Yeah.

2334
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:53,050
Yeah.
I haven't had the opportunity to do it.

2335
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,580
It's supposed to be ruthlessly 
interspective [inaudible].

2336
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,790
I've never done it either,
but I've had,

2337
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:00,340
I've had friends who had a pill problems
who,

2338
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:01,473
who did it and cured them,
but they said the ride is just 24 hours 

2339
01:50:04,991 --> 01:50:07,030
of like,
what in the fuck am I doing?

2340
01:50:07,450 --> 01:50:08,283
And then once it's over,
you have zero desire the way that it's 

2341
01:50:10,481 --> 01:50:11,770
used.
Traditionally in Africa,

2342
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:12,604
the root,
it's these tribes that user that's 

2343
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:20,930
hunters take it and they remained 
motionless for many hours on it.

2344
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:24,090
The animals come close.
I mean,

2345
01:50:24,091 --> 01:50:29,050
that always fascinated me.
That is fascinating.

2346
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,020
Yeah.
I wonder if,

2347
01:50:31,021 --> 01:50:32,470
uh,
taking it from the root.

2348
01:50:32,471 --> 01:50:34,130
I wonder if they have,
if it's,

2349
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:35,673
they're getting the exact same 
experiences they're getting in these 

2350
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:38,200
clinics.
I don't know.

2351
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:40,143
It just to me in terms of efficacy,
if you look at the recidivism rates of 

2352
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:48,580
relapse rather,
they're mean they're sir rubbery high.

2353
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:49,660
Yeah.
It's crazy,

2354
01:50:49,661 --> 01:50:50,290
right?
Yeah.

2355
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:55,290
How successful that stuff yet.
And yet nobody wants to talk about that.

2356
01:50:56,321 --> 01:50:57,154
These are all these clinics,
like it's crazy how many rehab clinics 

2357
01:50:59,311 --> 01:51:00,910
or are they?
We need you for six months.

2358
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:02,133
Really?
Mexico says they kill it all in three 

2359
01:51:03,611 --> 01:51:04,444
days.
I'd go down there and get into an in a 

2360
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:07,690
bogut clinic.
Yep.
