00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello Freak bitches.
What were some of,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,560
when you were treating patients in the
clinical pathology thing?

3
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:11,860
Like what were some of the patterns that
you saw that were,

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,670
you know,
really for some of the real challenges

5
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,800
that people face?
Like growing up,

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,870
you know,
like what were the main themes that were

7
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:22,480
the hardest,
hardest to deal with and bring into a

8
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:26,050
healthy adult life?
Trauma and disconnection.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,840
Disconnection from like what Joe was
saying in regards to mentorship and

10
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:34,360
having,
having a big brother or somebody in that

11
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:38,140
role that they could aspire to be like,
that could coach them through

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,170
challenging situations and going through
trauma because trauma is so rampant and

13
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:48,190
it's also our,
our representation in our

14
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:52,360
internalization of trauma.
Some people take that on as an identity,

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,630
that they've been traumatized or they've
been abused and,

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,290
and because it's not discussed,
it's in fact shamed.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,890
Um,
it's not really dealt with above board,

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,680
whether it's people being traumatized
sexually because the,

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,340
the perpetrator,
the person actually doing the traumatic

20
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:11,200
event,
they weren't integrated in their own

21
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,050
sexuality.
So it came out in a perverse way,

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,180
or it was the internalization of
something that seemed mild,

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,350
but because they didn't have the
languaging and the opportunity to

24
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:27,520
connect with somebody that it,
it held and seated over time.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Like if you see animals in the wild,
when they get traumatized,

26
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:33,220
like if you were driving a car and you
hit a deer,

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,610
the first thing that deer is going to do
when he gets to the side of the road,

28
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:41,200
it's going to shake it out.
It's going to just move that somatically

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,890
out of its body because trauma gets
imprinted into the sematic

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,720
infrastructure like,
but on,

31
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,900
he was talking about until the,
like the Fascia trauma gets fat,

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,350
kids gets programmed into the body,
it also gets trauma.

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,440
We'll change the genetic expression.
You actually see the DNA genetic code

34
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:01,660
change its expression at the time of
trauma.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
And that can be recapitulated
transgenerationally.

36
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,070
So from generation to generation to
generation,

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,700
I can still hold my parents' trauma,
my granddaughters,

38
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,020
an epigenetic phenomenon.
It's a transgenerational epigenetic

39
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,670
phenomena.
Right?

40
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,130
So that's so crazy.
It's so crazy.

41
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,290
So we we are,
and that's what the native Americans

42
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,220
talk about.
Like our,

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,090
our actions right now do affect seven
generations down the line because it

44
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,990
takes that long to bleed it out of the
jeans unless you clear it.

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,850
Yeah.
That's one thing that's weird about

46
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:36,250
opening for bands.
They will tune up while you're onstage.

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,500
Well,
on that level yet,

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,380
I mean,
when I work with Sherra was classy

49
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:41,810
because she was the one that,
that was the,

50
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:45,850
by far the best job I ever had an
opening for anybody because she knows

51
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,660
she had a great crowd.
She had transvestites and mothers with

52
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,750
the grandmothers,
with their grandchildren,

53
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,920
which is the audience.
Yeah.

54
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,260
You know what the security told me if
they ever saw a single straight guy

55
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,370
alone this thing,
any,

56
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,550
he looks straight,
they would,

57
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,250
they would track him all night because
no,

58
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,070
no guy along goes to a Cher concert of
his straight,

59
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,130
a gay guy dancing and happy.
No problem.

60
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,520
So if someone's going to be like a crazy
stalker,

61
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,260
it's going to be straight,
straight guy.

62
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,440
But she was fun though before.
Yeah.

63
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,770
You enjoyed working with her,
right?

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,730
Yeah,
I really liked her.

65
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,990
Do you ever feel like a friendship with
her?

66
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,490
Do you contact her?
I'm not anymore,

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,200
but you know,
she's,

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,300
she's very isolated,
you know,

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,010
she's a good person.
And she was like,

70
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,340
she used to ask me about the world,
like she wasn't really in it because she

71
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,500
wasn't really in it to go,
well what's it like?

72
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,920
And you know,
she asked me about people and one night

73
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,940
we went to,
I said,

74
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,040
I talked her into going out in Montreal.
I said,

75
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,780
look,
why don't you drop the outfits,

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,200
stop wearing a top hat and a cane.
And like maybe nobody will notice.

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,970
You know,
I could just fix her with the fucking

78
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,430
tales does lastly the dead,
the dead,

79
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,870
skipping back and forth.

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,660
And she is,
you know,

81
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,160
so we got to an ice cream place and some
like old,

82
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,260
I'd go in and look with French gut,
hey,

83
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,770
aren't you the famous one?
What's her name?

84
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,570
And that's all she had to hear it.
She goes,

85
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:14,620
yeah,
who could ever forget all,

86
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,710
what's her name?
So then now the validated that she can't

87
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:18,730
go out,
you know.

88
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,700
But one guy.
That's it.

89
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,150
Yeah.
But we had a good time.

90
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,700
You know,
we stayed with was a funny thing in the

91
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,100
casino we would meet,
uh,

92
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,310
when I like in the,
in the arenas I would do my act,

93
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,080
then they'd have a break and then she'd
come up.

94
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,450
So we'd never see each other except when
she had it,

95
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,700
like a team prayer.
And then sometimes I was in that.

96
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,140
But um,
when,

97
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,230
uh,
when she's,

98
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,380
we would cross each other one night her
grandmother and grandfather were there

99
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,390
and she said to me,
she goes,

100
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,480
you just did it.
Just joke with my grandparents there.

101
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,830
And I said,
by the way,

102
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,080
your answers out and your grandfather's
looking at it.

103
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,600
And she stopped the lift.

104
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,190
I got flagged for a while where I was
pulled every time I went to Vancouver

105
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,440
airport because one time I was leaving
is weird.

106
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:04,840
My wife had got me new bag.
It came with like,

107
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,420
she bought me some Cologne and then it
came,

108
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,190
it was a Calvin Klein bag late,
just a duffel bag that came with the

109
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,260
Cologne.
So I packed my stuff.

110
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,840
It was like a two day trip to New York.
It was when I was first doing the union,

111
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:16,780
I was looking for Cruz and I was
interviewing producers and stuff like

112
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:20,620
that and it was just a quick trip.
But then I came back and then they

113
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,600
pulled me aside and then they tested my
bag and they're like,

114
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,690
your bag is tested positive for cocaine.
And I was like,

115
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,560
what?
I was like,

116
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,461
bullshit.
I was like,

117
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,420
show it to me.
I was like,

118
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,210
I didn't know.

119
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,250
Understand at the time when they're
like,

120
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,570
we found cocaine all over your bag.
I'm like,

121
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:32,321
bullshit,
let me see it.

122
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,000
There's no cocaine in my bag.
And they said,

123
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,180
no,
no,

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,320
no.
Like we tested it.

125
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,750
There's particles.
Why would it be on there?

126
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,830
Do you do cocaine?
I'm like,

127
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,300
never in my life.
Not even tried it,

128
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,080
you know like,
well how is it all over your bag?

129
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm like,
I have no idea.

130
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,650
And then so we went in the back for
hours and they're like,

131
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,081
they're like,
Hey,

132
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,510
quit playing this game.
We talked to your friend.

133
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:49,841
I'm like,
good.

134
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:50,980
Well,
he would have told you the same thing.

135
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,900
So I was traveling with a friend and I
was like,

136
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:54,660
he would have told you the same thing,
good cop,

137
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:55,260
bad cop.
I'm like,

138
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,740
yeah.
He's like,

139
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:58,410
he told the drill and I was like,
wow.

140
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,351
Yeah,
that.

141
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,520
We went to New York,
we're looking at developing a

142
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,880
documentary and then it finally came
down to where I said,

143
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,530
okay,
like tell me how this particle thing

144
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,330
works.
Because I did the night deposit for my

145
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:09,980
nightclub the night before.
Right.

146
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:13,370
And they say a large majority of money,
especially in nightclubs and stuff.

147
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,300
I asked cocaine on it,
right.

148
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,940
People do a rail wipe their hand grabbed
the bill,

149
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,120
and I'd done the cash deposit for the
nightclub right before our flight.

150
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,700
I'd put it in that bag,
went to the night deposit,

151
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,830
put it in the bank,
and then I flew out to like six or seven

152
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,300
in the morning and like pack my gear
instead of,

153
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,690
so I said,
could it be that like cocaine was on the

154
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,340
money that was in,
in my bag that,

155
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,540
and they're like,
yes,

156
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,060
we can trace particles like that.

157
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm like,
well then there's your answer.

158
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,370
But then they looked at my club strip
club Cheetahs this night and then there,

159
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,930
then it was just like we were in there
longer and I was like,

160
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,570
ah.
So every time I came back and here's the

161
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,480
interesting thing is every time I came
back to Vancouver they flagged,

162
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,400
they'd pull me aside,
pulled me and finally I was so mad.

163
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,570
I was like one in the morning.
I was like,

164
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,430
please just don't pull me aside.
I'm so tired.

165
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,220
I got to drive to the outskirts of
Vancouver to stay at my buddy's place.

166
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:58,490
I just want to go to bed,
please go to the side.

167
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:59,990
I'm like,
so I was so mad.

168
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:02,420
I just laid on their metal counter.
I was tired neck cause you know they do

169
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,760
the thing where they put you over there
and then nobody comes for like half

170
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,870
hour,
just make you sit there.

171
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,490
So I just laid,
I started napping.

172
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:08,960
It was exhausted like one 30 in the
morning,

173
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,600
coming back from New York.
I laid up there and the girl comes to

174
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,560
get down.
I'm like,

175
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,820
I'm tired.
It's one 30 in the morning,

176
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:17,570
I'm really tired and I'm not playing any
games like she and I finally just said,

177
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,980
why am I getting pulled over all the
time?

178
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,600
I've never broken a law.
You can't like,

179
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,180
there's nothing every check your thing.
I've never done anything.

180
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,130
I've never brought over items that I
shouldn't,

181
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,780
I haven't meet.
And she's like,

182
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,670
well,
the big problem is is that one time your

183
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:29,660
bag got test.
And I was like,

184
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,370
I explained that and that should all be
in the notes,

185
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,151
right?
She said,

186
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,550
yeah,
but we always don't trust it when you

187
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:38,390
say you don't do the product right and
it's all over your bag because then we

188
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,350
think you're a smuggler.

189
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,630
She's like,
you're almost better to just say,

190
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,730
Yup,
I did some cocaine with friends or

191
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,770
whatever and we don't have any on me.
And I was like,

192
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:46,880
but I don't.
I don't do it.

193
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,380
I'm not going to say I did it.
And she's like,

194
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,120
well,
that's why they think you're maybe a

195
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,370
smuggler.
You're doing quick trips to New York.

196
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,590
It's on your bag.
Well,

197
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,320
it's like the guy who got in trouble for
structuring

198
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,150
you did it similar to what it is we're
going to take.

199
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,140
Your money was just cash.
They have a bunch of different

200
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:10,220
techniques that they teach these
knuckleheads to try to like recognize

201
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:13,100
shady people.
And so they like think they're fucking

202
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,150
spies.
They're like think they're detectives

203
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,010
staring at everybody.
But that Jamie Bern and look at his

204
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:21,760
face,
I saw a deceptive tips.

205
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,810
Her and I immediately pulled out of the
line.

206
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,270
I actually got the guy really pissed off
when it,

207
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,190
cause I used to get,
these were the Canadian guys and I'm a

208
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:28,971
Canadian stuff,
so I was like,

209
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,640
you can't kick me out of my own country.
So I battle with them a little bit

210
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,420
harder.
Right.

211
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,470
And the one guy asked me,
he's like,

212
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,450
have you ever done a narcotic?
And I was like,

213
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,201
no,
never done it.

214
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:36,711
Narcotic.
It's like,

215
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:37,850
if you never smoked weed,
I'm like,

216
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,550
that's not a narcotic.
Narcotic comes from the Latin word,

217
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,530
meaning narcosis causing asleep and do
state,

218
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,110
which is usually applied to opiates and
heroin and stuff like that.

219
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,363
I was like,
no.

220
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,650
I was like,
marijuana is a psycho tropical drawing.

221
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,410
I think he was just like,
you psycho tropic,

222
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,790
right?
That's a tropical.

223
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,080
It's like a,
it's part of the world.

224
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,010
And,
and uh,

225
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,210
and he was just like,
let's not get to the nitty gritty.

226
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:57,601
And I said,
no,

227
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,080
no,
no.

228
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,300
You're a border guard.
You're asking me questions.

229
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,610
I'm answering honestly.
So if you're going to ask me questions,

230
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,130
you make sure you answered that.
You asked me the right one and I will

231
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,840
give you the correct answer.
And he was like,

232
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,740
go,
you can go.

233
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,611
That's the difference.
You,

234
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:13,650
Canadians and Americans,
Americans,

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,710
Canadians,
more willing to admit the feet.

236
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,610
Excuse me.
Sorry.

237
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:23,710
Okay.
