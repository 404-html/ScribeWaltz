1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,860
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,950
I can just see him in his mind.

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:05,170
I mean,

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,250
he loves me and he doesn't,

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,650
it doesn't bother him until he did.

6
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,141
He did.

7
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,610
He doesn't get embarrassed,

8
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,503
but he has to,

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,700
but you can see them guarding his loins.

10
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:12,911
You know,

11
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:13,800
like God.

12
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,960
Did she just say that
freshman year's guard thing?

13
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:17,794
His lawyer,

14
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,270
his lawyer guard thing.

15
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,590
I don't even know what that means.

16
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,370
Gert thing.

17
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,760
What does Curtin good clip it.

18
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,320
I think you're the first
person on this podcast.

19
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,670
Ever say to me,

20
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,641
oh,

21
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,474
that's hilarious.

22
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,860
Gert Ding spelling.

23
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,010
Gerd,

24
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,580
Gerd.

25
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,300
G.

26
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,300
I.

27
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,300
R.

28
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,300
D.

29
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,300
I.

30
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,300
N.

31
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,300
G.

32
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,301
Jimmy.

33
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,061
You never heard that before,

34
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:41,700
have you?

35
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,310
This is the first time in all my years
I've heard girding girding your loins.

36
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:47,810
I would imagine be clenching.

37
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,600
Yes,

38
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,050
yes.

39
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,310
Yeah.

40
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,860
I just context put it together.

41
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:52,430
Occurred.

42
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,290
Here you go and circle
a with a belt or a band.

43
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,060
A young woman.

44
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,900
A young man was a,

45
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,470
wants to be girded with
a belt of knighthood.

46
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:00,771
Oh,

47
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:01,604
okay.

48
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,740
Cure up Scottish guard.

49
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,151
What makes sense?

50
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:07,100
Girding you're talking about constricting.

51
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,700
Girdy gird your loins lions.

52
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,993
Gotcha.

53
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,660
Get ready or gear up

54
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,721
your loins.

55
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:22,170
Wow,

56
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,741
that's a good one.

57
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,180
You're learning on this show.

58
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,014
This is a,

59
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,880
this is a show of it.

60
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,580
Mind,

61
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,660
there's plenty more where that goes.

62
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,030
Do you think the smartest coyote
is smarter than the dumbest person?

63
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,350
Yeah.

64
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,183
Whoa.

65
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,293
That's deep.

66
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,200
That's deep.

67
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,580
Yeah.

68
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:41,851
I mean,

69
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,601
they live in places,

70
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:43,800
but I don't know if I could live there.

71
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,290
Wow.

72
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,160
So now what city has,

73
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:47,340
uh,

74
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,490
is there any city in the country that
actually has a legitimate problem with

75
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,324
coyotes?

76
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,100
Depends.

77
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,770
Have you talked to,

78
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,340
I mean,

79
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,731
La,

80
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,050
we definitely have our issues,

81
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,381
right?

82
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,670
I mean there's been bites.

83
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,100
There's been other situations been bitten.

84
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,730
Yeah.

85
00:01:59,730 --> 00:01:59,941
Yeah.

86
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:01,410
Elysian park had some bites.

87
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,300
There's been bites down in Orange County.

88
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,010
It had some bites.

89
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,480
Are they biting homeless people?

90
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:06,901
Are they biting?

91
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,920
People would take naps.

92
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,430
What are the,

93
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,820
what do I do?

94
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,090
Um,

95
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,930
it's all over the board.

96
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:13,470
Usually it seems to be tied to people
been feeding it and so it's almost coming

97
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,200
up and biting like people on
the hands or people on the leg.

98
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,040
Um,

99
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,360
I don't think any of them know.

100
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:21,270
The ones I've heard had been like where
they're trying to take the person down

101
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,531
real type thing.

102
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,250
They've all been more like where
they're coming up and none of them,

103
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,370
none of them have.

104
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,750
Yes.

105
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,430
Do you heard about that woman
who was a folk singer in Canada?

106
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,830
They got killed a couple
of years back by coyotes.

107
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,041
Yeah.

108
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,530
I actually went up there a
couple of years after that.

109
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,730
They actually got a study going on,

110
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,541
coyotes up there.

111
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,510
They radio collared a bunch and I went
up there and helped him capture or the

112
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:42,480
first couple of animals to kind of see
what's going on and that's just a crazy

113
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,320
scenario up there.

114
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,090
It's way different than
what we see down here.

115
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,980
The coyotes first or
there eastern coyotes,

116
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:47,850
so they're a little bit bigger,

117
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,921
but they're also,

118
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,170
they,

119
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,640
they kind of,

120
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,620
there's very few food sources up there.

121
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,150
They're dealing with snowshoe hares,

122
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,280
which their cycles kind
of fluctuate up and down.

123
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,040
And so sometimes there can be tons of
food and other times there can be almost

124
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,770
none,

125
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,770
but they've learned that they can take
advantage of Moose during the winter and

126
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,350
they're actually killing
Moose in the snow.

127
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,890
What you'd think of this
little 40 pound animal,

128
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,420
take it on this huge moose,

129
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,441
but they're seeing it.

130
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,160
They do these snow surveys and they're
finding these dead moose that were very

131
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,360
clearly killed by coyotes.

132
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,141
Wow.

133
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,760
So a full grown Mousse.

134
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,630
Yeah.

135
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,740
That's insane.

136
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,220
Yeah.

137
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,860
A full grown moose is like
more than a thousand pounds.

138
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,320
Yeah.

139
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,640
Yeah.

140
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:24,911
I know.

141
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:25,101
It's,

142
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:25,780
it's amazing.

143
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,021
I mean,

144
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,760
obviously these moose in the winter,

145
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,600
the snow gets deep,

146
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,790
so there they're definitely,

147
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,450
they can get stuck in things and that
type of scenario would they know that it's

148
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,040
coyotes and killed them and not wolves.

149
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,330
There's no wolves there.

150
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,700
Wow.

151
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,420
Yeah.

152
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,620
That's crazy.

153
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,483
Yeah.

154
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,650
So I had Russian nurses running
from me and just crazy stories.

155
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,130
Like why were they trying to do to you?

156
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,790
Uh,

157
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,623
well,

158
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,190
this Russian nurse was in an allergist
office and she was giving wrong doses to

159
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,050
the kids and stuff of shots.

160
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,910
So I had all my documentation,

161
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,320
like these yellow pads that goes,

162
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,530
there's um,

163
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,451
we can see,

164
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:00,600
right,

165
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,433
I'm 22 years old.

166
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,700
You can see right here.

167
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,960
Then she tries to grab it.

168
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,670
Now it's a tug of war across a desk.

169
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,080
And I dunno what the fuck is going on.

170
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,580
And um,

171
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,780
she takes off and runs
down a hallway and I'm 22.

172
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:12,931
I'm like,

173
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:13,450
well shit,

174
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,900
I fucking run down the hallway afterwards
and she goes into a patient room and

175
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:17,041
10,

176
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,040
she locks the door and then I get the
door open and just somebody to unlock it.

177
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,980
And she's in there and she's
talking to her husband on the phone.

178
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:23,260
She goes,

179
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,591
Andrew,

180
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:25,980
there is a man here who's telling me lies.

181
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,070
He telling me lie,

182
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,940
I didn't want to tell you,

183
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:30,440
Lisa,

184
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,440
I am pregnant and I'm going to lose
the baby because of these moms that I'm

185
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,354
going

186
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,183
totally holy

187
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,073
freaking out.

188
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,370
So I teach a bunch of Vietnamese people
had a shit and it was one day I got away

189
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,000
a call.

190
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,833
Yeah,

191
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,920
I got a call from this guy.

192
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,870
Well they were her mungs.

193
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,740
Okay.

194
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,150
You know what Hmong is like this.

195
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,560
If you saw a Grand Torino,

196
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,300
that movie with Clint Eastwood,

197
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,500
I think the H is silent.

198
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,400
H.

199
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,401
M o.

200
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,030
U.

201
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,030
N.

202
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,863
G.

203
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,600
And then there are people without a land.

204
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,470
Yeah.

205
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,450
And then they all came to San Jose,

206
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,940
California to work in assembly plants.

207
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,540
So they're in this cable assembly pant.

208
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,460
A plant called Cable Co.

209
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,930
That was a big client of ours.

210
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,040
And I got a call from,

211
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:20,801
it's really cool guys.

212
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:21,634
And he was chip,

213
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,810
chip bronc because Al
you got to get down here.

214
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:25,890
You're not going to fucking believe it.

215
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,900
And I got a situation and I go,

216
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:28,261
what is it?

217
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,220
And it goes better.

218
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:30,054
You see

219
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,720
I want to go to the bathroom.

220
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,003
Shit everywhere.

221
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,580
What?

222
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,410
Cause they had never been used to toilets.

223
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,480
So they were standing on the toilet seats.

224
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,570
I found out that's what was going on.

225
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,610
They all had fake names like a,

226
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,940
the name is [inaudible],

227
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,470
but you can call me Keith.

228
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,651
Hey Keith,

229
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:50,191
fluke league.

230
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,210
Can you come here for a second?

231
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:54,720
Can I start with the shit everywhere?

232
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,651
Like on the ground?

233
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:55,771
Yeah.

234
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:56,604
They were missing.

235
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,120
It's a toilet seat is not
to fucking hold you up.

236
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,150
So they're waddling up there and they
were standing on the standing on the

237
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,083
toilets.

238
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,570
They were just used to like
shitting and shitting in holes.

239
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,381
Oh my God.

240
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,011
If they're lucky,

241
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:10,311
you know,

242
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:11,450
in the woods or whatever.

243
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,050
He said,

244
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,100
Jesus Christ.

245
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,480
So you're lucky.

246
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,550
Not Lucky where they hold it forever.

247
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,520
So yeah,

248
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,353
it is backed up.

249
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,670
Comes a brick.

250
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,480
Yeah.

251
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,991
So,

252
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,824
um,

253
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,431
anyway,

254
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,630
I gathered everybody around.

255
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,750
I just appointed a bathroom
monitor and oh my God,

256
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:27,860
a bathroom monitors.

257
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,170
So I had one of the guys
who was a supervisor,

258
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,250
I had a clipboard.

259
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,630
I put a lock on the map
room door and then she,

260
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:36,080
you become this corporate fixer.

261
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,280
That's what I was doing.

262
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,470
Story that didn't,

263
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,760
that we engaged in.

264
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:41,271
That's famous.

265
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,740
That's not about this journey.

266
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,450
I'll give you an example.

267
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,121
The protocol.

268
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:45,954
Sound

269
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,870
parable question seems religious
doesn't really make much sense.

270
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,933
Do you know the story?

271
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,551
Sure.

272
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:54,630
But why don't you lay it out?

273
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,370
So there's a father,

274
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,230
he has two sons and oldest son,

275
00:06:58,231 --> 00:06:59,064
the younger son,

276
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,420
and he says to them,

277
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,430
who wants to spend their inheritance?

278
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,530
The younger says me that
don't go and spend it,

279
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,390
and the youngest son takes all the dough
and he runs off and sniffs coke off

280
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:14,391
stripper's tits for a number of years
until he realizes this is getting pretty

281
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:17,400
boring and I'm in a lot of trouble.

282
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,080
He ends up feeding,

283
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,090
throwing food to pigs.

284
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,953
That's his job.

285
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,160
And he can't even eat the food
that he gives to the pigs.

286
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:27,090
At which point he says,

287
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:27,361
Dad,

288
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:28,320
will you take me back?

289
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,400
That then goes to,

290
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,353
they don't meet.

291
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,340
This somehow happens.

292
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,750
Not through telephones.

293
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,950
It just happens at which point that
goes to the fatty carbs has killed the

294
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:41,784
fatted calf.

295
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,290
Oldest sons hustled on that.

296
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,173
What's going on?

297
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,770
I've stayed with you since the beginning.

298
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I've been loyal to you and I hear the
stories of my younger brother coming back

299
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,870
who's been sniffing coke off stripper's
tits for the last topic on those how

300
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:57,840
many years and you're prepared
to kill the fatted calf.

301
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,300
W what's the SP that I want another story.

302
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:01,951
He says,

303
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:02,550
you're right son.

304
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,383
Don't worry about that.

305
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,980
You take a little side step,

306
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,791
a little step to the side.

307
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,421
You'll always be with me.

308
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,254
You're a good boy.

309
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,260
At which point he goes out
to meet the protocol son,

310
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,243
the wasteful son.

311
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,660
The waste will some returns and he says
you will awesome that you're found.

312
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,030
That's the end of the story

313
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,200
is quite hard to make sense
of that in a literal sense.

314
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,980
You go all dance was a bit unfair.

315
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:24,091
Me,

316
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:27,540
you should have been kind to the oldest
son cause he never ran off and did

317
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,374
anything.

318
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,110
But the essence of the story
is that you are the father.

319
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,400
You are enough.

320
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,540
Your oldest son is your intellect.

321
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,381
He says,

322
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:42,591
Oh,

323
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:43,071
don't do this.

324
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:43,904
Don't do that.

325
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,110
He's trying to reconcile,

326
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,690
make sense of a prosaic
and material world.

327
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,410
The younger son being the
wild feral entity that he is.

328
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,160
What's going out in the to
find out what it's all about.

329
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,310
Yeah.

330
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,060
So when he's recklessness
and sense of adventure,

331
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,060
he finds that he can't escape himself.

332
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,910
So we has to return to himself and at
which point he has to accept who he is,

333
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,130
which point the intellect is left out.

334
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,140
The equation pretty much is the older
brother because he can't understand the

335
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:23,010
significance of the journey
of the wasteful brother.

336
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,263
Any end,

337
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,660
you have to leave yourself to
understand the value of yourself.

338
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,930
You have to lose stuff before you realize
that all the stuff that you're losing
