1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
[inaudible],
we're back world,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,800
I used to say America,
but foreign people get upset for

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:10,860
bastards living in other countries.
Sad enough.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,820
It can't be grace on our patch of dirt.
Uh,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,370
I just had to explained to Cameron Hanes
that when your iphone,

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,750
when you use a bunch of Apps,
you double click on that bottom button

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,030
and then you,
it shows you all the apps that are

8
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:25,800
running in the background.
Most people don't know this.

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:27,450
Most people just use their phone.
Right?

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,580
But that's a fucking resource,
Robert,

11
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,414
right there,
buddy.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,470
You gotta.
Be careful.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,560
I learned something today.
I got to have to show people things.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,310
Now when I'm showing you tech tips,
you know,

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,220
you know your tech retarded.
I'm a little bit behind the curve.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,430
So what's happening brother?
How you feeling,

17
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:46,650
man?
You just ran 100 miles a week ago.

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,543
Yeah,
I did.

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,870
It was,
it was about a week ago,

20
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:49,440
right?

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,340
It was,
yeah,

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,670
it was last Saturday and Sunday.
So father's Day.

23
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,350
All in preparation for a 200 mile run in
August.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,360
That's right.
God Damn Dude.

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,180
Yeah.
We're talking about today,

26
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:06,810
like the mental games that your brain
starts playing on you.

27
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,240
Yeah.
And you were describing all the shit

28
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:11,250
that your brain starts doing to you
while you're running.

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,043
Yeah.
I always.

30
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,030
There's so many peaks and valleys when
you push yourself like that and it's uh,

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,500
you know,
I was thinking about all the ways I

32
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,500
could quit,
how I could come up with an excuse to

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,020
get out of this race and really I could
come,

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,110
I could say anything because who's gonna
who's gonna ever questioned it because

35
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:33,721
it's like,
okay,

36
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:36,420
how many people have ever run for 24
straight hours.

37
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,260
Right?
So you can,

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,250
you can't really question me,
but it's just I pushed myself.

39
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,560
So I mean I couldn't live with myself if
I quit the race,

40
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,540
but I'm not saying I wasn't thinking
about how nice it would have been

41
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,374
stopped running.

42
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,380
Well,
anytime you're working out,

43
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,660
I mean if you just think about a yoga
class,

44
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,610
which is only 90 minutes.
Yeah,

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,710
those last 20 minutes you totally
thinking about,

46
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,170
it'd be so nice to just get the fuck out
of this hot room.

47
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,050
Drinks cold water.
But you just power through now.

48
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:04,020
Multiply that times 24.
Yeah.

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,820
And way harder.
Yeah,

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,350
because you're running,
you're exhausted,

51
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,810
you're in pain.
I can't even imagine I'm saying all

52
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,400
these things and I'm just guessing.
It's like,

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,953
well,
it's,

54
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,470
you know,
I,

55
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,010
I teamed up with a pretty good runner,
Jo Johann to start the race.

56
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,990
He was getting a workout in.
Um,

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,960
he was pacing at the western states 100,
which was this last weekend.

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,750
And um,
so he,

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,820
he wanted to get a good workout,
so I was like,

60
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,040
oh cool,
I can knock off a bunch of miles with

61
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,560
him.
So we were running pretty fast pretty

62
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,910
fast for,
you know,

63
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,650
when you have to run for 24 straight
hours.

64
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,130
But we knocked off 10 miles quickly.
I remember I was running with him,

65
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,260
as you know,
after you run 10 miles,

66
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,210
you know,
you've done something and I'm thinking

67
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,660
to myself,
I got 19 more miles.

68
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,540
I felt like I had already got a pretty
good workout and I hadn't even got

69
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,540
started.
Really felt like you were done and you

70
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,110
had 90 miles left.
Yeah.

71
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,560
So it's uh,
it's,

72
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,573
you know,

73
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,280
you talk about mental strength and just
keeping,

74
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,880
keep hammering.
Yeah,

75
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,210
exactly.
He just had to keep hammering daunting

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,930
[inaudible].
And what is it like when it's over?

77
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,730
What is the feeling like when you cross,
when it's 24 hours at times up,

78
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,200
you look at your,
your distance,

79
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,660
102 miles.
What does that feel like?

80
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,100
It feels good most days,
and this is just me,

81
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,470
I can't expect anybody to be able to
relate to my screwed up mine,

82
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:34,180
but I mean me personally,
I can go run 15 miles,

83
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,750
get a good workout,
go home and an hour later I'm thinking I

84
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,000
could have done more.
I'm not satisfied.

85
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,530
So the big thing for me is when I've
done something like that for the one of

86
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:52,531
the few times throughout the year,
I feel satisfied that I gave what I had.

87
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,940
Wow.
So it's just so brutal that you never

88
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,020
feel like you could have done more.

89
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,221
No,
no,

90
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,461
no,
no.

91
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,770
I always think I could have been more.
No,

92
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm disappointed with myself.
Uh,

93
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,000
um,
just because in that race,

94
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,210
and I can,
I can try to have it make sense.

95
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,430
Um,
I can be logical about it and I could

96
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,830
say,
well I went out really fast because I

97
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:18,310
want it to be as miserable as possible
for as long as possible to prepare

98
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,920
myself for the big foot 200.
So I can say,

99
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,010
well I ran super hard for,
for hours hoping I was going to be

100
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,100
miserable for 20 and I knew my pace that
would,

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,170
would have been a,
would be slower and it'd be more painful

102
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:32,140
but in the big picture to help me.
Um,

103
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,120
but that's just words to me.
I'm thinking I had a,

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,850
I was in first place through 50 miles.
I was,

105
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,850
you know,
did 50 miles and in eight hours.

106
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,270
And so I was on pace for a lot of miles,
a second place at a 62 miles and I was

107
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,210
at 12 hours.
I had run,

108
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,080
I think 65 miles.
So I'm on pace for 130,

109
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,980
so I really died.
And Yeah,

110
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,770
you,
I can,

111
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,120
I can use words and say,
well,

112
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,740
is it,
it was a plan,

113
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,690
it was,
it was part of being miserable and

114
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,790
preparing myself for a greater
challenge,

115
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,930
but I also feel like,
you know,

116
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,440
I gave up,
I'm miles and I could gotten my most

117
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,440
miles ever and I should have got 120
plus miles.

118
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,520
And so yeah,
there's always the feeling I could have

119
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,880
done more even even though.
But I'm a little bit satisfied

120
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,330
now.
We're at the end of it.

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,500
So you're,
you're,

122
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,920
you're killing it at 50 miles.
You're in first place.

123
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,340
And then is it just simply a matter of
you just muscle fatigue and pain and

124
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,140
you're just saying for me can only push
so far?

125
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,170
Yeah,
I can't speak for anybody else probably

126
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,620
for some people it's fatigue.
Some people it's a just mental

127
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,630
exhaustion.
Um,

128
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,840
for me it's pain,
it's just I've run and I did my first

129
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:56,960
marathon in 2002,
so I've been doing this for whatever,

130
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,180
14 years.
Um,

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,450
multiple marathons every year back to
back.

132
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:07,451
Sometimes my body is not 100 percent,
so I can push,

133
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,120
I have a high pain tolerance,
but eventually,

134
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,800
um,
it adds up and so it's pain for me.

135
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,740
Is this a joint pain,
knees,

136
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,360
everything.
Is it just the whole body?

137
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,180
It's waste down,
hips,

138
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,280
knees,
ankles,

139
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,960
feet.
And how long does it take you to

140
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,670
recover?
Like you were telling me that your legs

141
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,830
are swollen.
Twice the size of normal.

142
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,050
Yeah.
Last year.

143
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,660
Last year was way worse.
This year I had,

144
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,280
I've put in a bunch of miles leading up.
I was running about a half a marathon a

145
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,490
day,
so my body was,

146
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,240
is pretty fit and pretty used to it.
So my recovery was much shorter.

147
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,340
I mean I,
and again,

148
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,960
people aren't going to understand this,
but the next day after I ran 102 I ran

149
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:00,620
13 miles and that was just because when
I run the big foot 200,

150
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,900
I'm going to have to be able to come
back after,

151
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,350
you know,
multiple days of being hurt and banged

152
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,840
up.
And that's the name of the game,

153
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,490
you know,
to cover 200 miles in a couple days,

154
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:15,170
like I want to,
I'm not going to be a hundred percent.

155
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,260
So I thought well I can't,
I can't know what it feels like to run

156
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:25,751
after I run 100 miles and less one.
I run a hundred miles and two,

157
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,220
I run the day after.

158
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,250
So you can't simulate that.
There's no way to simulate that.

159
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,210
So you ran 13 miles a day after you run
100,

160
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,230
two miles.
And what the fuck is that like a,

161
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,030
it'd be using the term loosely.
It was painful.

162
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:44,330
Slow.
I was hiking the uphills running would

163
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,020
be like,
it would,

164
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,120
I probably looked like a 90 year old man
trying to run it.

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,080
Fricken hurt.
And what are you legs?

166
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,490
Totally swollen.
What you doing this?

167
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,820
Yeah.
[inaudible].

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,393
Yeah.
My uh,

169
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,750
my ankles are swollen and calves that
don't really have an ankle.

170
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:07,751
It's the same size for my foot up.
And I mean it's not good for me.

171
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,330
I mean it's not in anybody who talks
about doing hundreds.

172
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,710
Hundreds aren't good for anybody.
So it's,

173
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,643
it's.
Yeah.

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,840
I know that what I do isn't in the best
interest of my body,

175
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,840
but it's just the name of the game is
what I do,

176
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,470
so what you do is not in the best
interest of your body.

177
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,840
You understand this,
you're very aware of this and you're a

178
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:34,841
professional bowhunter essentially,
but you have this thing in your head

179
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,480
where you have to push yourself as far
and as hard as possible to find out for

180
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:45,581
yourself to set goals,
to try to push past this pain and

181
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,950
endurance barrier that you have.
Is that what it all is?

182
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,220
I'm just trying to make sense of it
because it's not like you're getting

183
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,340
paid to do these.
No,

184
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,740
these are amateur race now.
Not Getting at all.

185
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,010
This

186
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,320
is just for me.
I used to think I was an idiot for

187
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,960
competing in martial arts matches for no
money.

188
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,040
Yeah.
You know,

189
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,890
but this is.
This is crazy.

190
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:07,740
Like you're.
You're doing this at 48 years old with a

191
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:10,360
family with a job.
Yeah.

192
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,360
And you're still.
Yeah.

193
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,194
It's just,
it's just,

194
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,410
it's just what I feel like I need to do
and I don't.

195
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,390
I don't,
you know,

196
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,760
don't know how long you're going to
continue to do this.

197
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,740
No,
but uh,

198
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,660
you know,
that people have told me when I started

199
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,870
doing marathons and running the mountain
back home,

200
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,060
like I said,
I don't know,

201
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,950
years ago,
15 years ago,

202
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,180
and people said then,
well,

203
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,340
if you keep running like this by the
time you're 40,

204
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,790
you won't be able to run.
And so here I am.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,990
They always say that.
Yeah,

206
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,130
I know.
So I just,

207
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,820
the point to point to that is I don't
really care.

208
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,670
I don't do it for anybody.
I don't do what I do for anybody else.

209
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,710
Just for me.
I feel like I need to do this.

210
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:56,400
I like pushing my limits.
That's why,

211
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,130
you know,
if I would have listened to people

212
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,640
telling me what I shouldn't do or
couldn't do or nobody could do,

213
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,950
I wouldn't have done hardly anything in
my life.

214
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,070
So the point is I don't care.
I don't care what anybody says,

215
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,050
I don't care what anybody thinks.
I just,

216
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,850
this is what I do.
I need to do it.

217
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,510
I like finding my absolute limit and
seeing how much I can withstand and this

218
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,240
is us offices.
Yeah,

219
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,250
that's a weird thing that people always
do.

220
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,000
They have you do that.
It's going to kill you if you have debt.

221
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,410
It's going to break it down.
What are you doing?

222
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:26,370
Lifting weights.
You know,

223
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,150
I've heard the people that lift weights
actually live shorter lives,

224
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,043
right?

225
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,270
There's always this,
these people that want to tell you to

226
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,780
not do that.
You know,

227
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,450
like I'm always like,
why are you doing it?

228
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,820
But I'm never going to tell you don't do
it.

229
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,560
I just don't understand that there's,
there's something to that mentality that

230
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,130
we're kind of talking about this earlier
today.

231
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,240
I think there's something in some people
when they see someone doing something

232
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:52,860
crazy that they can't do and they want
to figure out there's got to be

233
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,830
something wrong with you and they've got
to figure out a way to criticize you

234
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,060
instead of saying,
wow,

235
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:59,250
that guy's fucking crazy.
Or Wow,

236
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,640
that's a crazy commitment.
I,

237
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,230
I don't want to do it,
but I respect,

238
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,730
appreciate it.
Instead of doing that,

239
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,750
they try to like poke holes that may or
may not even be there.

240
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,770
They try to.
You're kind of admitting that it's not

241
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,200
good for you,
not kind of your 100 percent admitting

242
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,130
for you.

243
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,050
It's not,
but it is good for you in one way you're

244
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,060
like your mind desires this extreme
challenge and that keeps you very calm

245
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:30,600
and sane.
See as your.

246
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,010
You're the kind of guy where I feel like
if that didn't exist you would have like

247
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:39,570
real problems,
like just integrating and relating to

248
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,570
regular society probably.
I mean that's,

249
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,620
I dunno,
I dunno what I would be like without the

250
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:51,000
challenge that I take on if I,
but part of me feels like if I didn't do

251
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,680
it,
I would be a shell of myself as far as

252
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,930
I wouldn't be living up to my ability.
My whole thing is like if I'm able to do

253
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,760
it,
I need to attempt it.

254
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,170
I need to try.
I need to do it.

255
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:05,830
I mean because I just think that people
need to live up to their full potential.

256
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,820
That's what I'm doing.

257
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,950
Is there anything else though that you
think is interesting like in that way,

258
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:13,710
like this is,
it's a competitive thing in some ways,

259
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,360
like because you were saying,
you know,

260
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:17,400
hey,
I'm first place at 50 miles,

261
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:20,370
but at some,
somewhere along the line it becomes

262
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:23,250
more,
you're pushing yourself and it becomes

263
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:26,910
less of you in.
You're not really engaging with someone

264
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,470
else,
even if you're racing them,

265
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,660
you really kind of all in your own mind.
Right?

266
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:31,390
Is that.

267
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,400
Yeah,
it's uh,

268
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,630
yeah,
look,

269
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,630
I look at it more of just a competition
with myself than with another race or,

270
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,440
or,
or another person.

271
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,310
Of course if I'm running it would be
cool to be first,

272
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,080
you know,
I mean that's just,

273
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,510
I'm a competitive person.
There's no doubt.

274
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,260
But what I do,
my workouts are always by myself.

275
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,330
I'm,
nobody's pushing me.

276
00:12:55,331 --> 00:13:00,190
It's just me and setting the goals,
like to run big foot $200 or whatever.

277
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,660
That's just me,
you know,

278
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,230
I don't know if anybody,
I might not even see anybody during that

279
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,180
whole race.
So it was just like,

280
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,080
you know,
I think there's 75 or so people signed

281
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,090
up,
but it's going to be probably pretty

282
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:17,110
spread out pretty quickly just depending
on how fast people go out or do whatever

283
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,430
over 200 miles point to point.
So I could go,

284
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,820
you know,
to complete days and not see anybody.

285
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,821
So yeah,
it's,

286
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,520
it's not,
it's not really,

287
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,210
it's not like the Olympic 100 meter dash
where you're lined up against,

288
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,060
you know,
eight other guys and you see exactly

289
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,100
where everybody is at.
It's,

290
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,530
this is more about a test of a personal
will.

291
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,753
So,

292
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,370
you know,
we were talking today also,

293
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,840
we're a guy that we know who's a kind of
an expert and a lot of physical things

294
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,130
are saying,
well why don't you,

295
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,390
uh,
take epo,

296
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,310
all these people that you're racing
against,

297
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,800
you'd probably take an epo.
It's not like they're going to test you,

298
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,173
but you're like,
well,

299
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,400
[inaudible] probably not going to help
me with pain.

300
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,370
No,
I don't really know what EPA does,

301
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:05,371
but all I know is what,
what limits me is just that pain.

302
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,980
So unless something can like make me
mentally stronger,

303
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,660
I don't know if it's gonna help and uh,
and a race like that because it's not

304
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:15,430
like you're going super fast,
you know,

305
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,240
it's not like the pace is extraordinary.
It's just grinding.

306
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,900
Those ultra marathon guys are seeking
help with edible marijuana.

307
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,800
That's a big one lately.
And apparently it's a big with a lot of

308
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,801
these ultra marathon guys were just
reduces inflammation in some way that

309
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:37,490
they find very beneficial as opposed to
nonsteroidal anti inflammatories,

310
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,970
which we'll probably get into to.
It was talking about that because the

311
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,230
Rhonda Patrick thing,
but these ultra marathon guys,

312
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,340
you know,
now that it's becoming more and more

313
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,400
acceptable to use cannabis as people are
coming out and talking about it's,

314
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,503
you know,

315
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,190
it's uh,
it's interesting that it benefits them

316
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:59,420
in that way because a Jujitsu people
have been saying it for years that,

317
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:01,480
uh,
people always associate marijuana with

318
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,150
you being lazy.
But with a lot of Jujitsu guys,

319
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:08,510
they find that it makes them more
creative and more tuned into what

320
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:11,030
they're doing.
And also able to.

321
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,050
Jujitsu can be pretty painful too.
But although it's a different kind of

322
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,380
pain,
it's pain in,

323
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:20,450
in short,
short exchanges or painful that you

324
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,180
don't want to tap and you fight your way
out of a choke or something like that.

325
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,720
But the grinding monotonous pain of what
you're doing is kind of a different kind

326
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,090
of pain.
If I talk about what it would be like,

327
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,560
I'm just talking out of my ass.
Yeah.

328
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,410
Well here's what I.
here's what I will say.

329
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,470
If somebody would offer me some edible
cannabis at mile 80 last weekend you had

330
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,200
taken it,
I would.

331
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,890
I would have done almost anything to
make the pain stop.

332
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,280
But
I have a regular job.

333
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,590
I get surprised.
Drug tests at work so often they

334
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:58,190
surprised drug does to a god.
I don't even,

335
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,450
I don't know.
Probably.

336
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,390
I don't know.
Once a year.

337
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,640
And what are they testing for?
I don't know.

338
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,130
Just they just want your pee pee man.
Yeah.

339
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,920
I don't know what they do,
but I mean I'm not.

340
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,140
You know,
there's something fucked up about that

341
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:16,250
because it's one thing if you were doing
a terrible job like yeah,

342
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,610
like say if you were like a a guy who
handles heavy machinery,

343
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,140
you keep cutting off people's fingers
like,

344
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,210
Hey,
maybe we should test camp a fuck.

345
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:27,560
Is he up to camps high as fuck?
It's not that.

346
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,500
It's just they just decided like even if
your job,

347
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,820
if you're doing your job well,
they still feel like they can test your

348
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:39,821
body and find out what you're doing and
it's also one of the real problems is

349
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,440
it's rooted in ignorance because if
you're,

350
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,740
if you have this stuff in your system,
like say if you smoke pot on a Friday,

351
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,240
you get off work,
have a joint,

352
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
go play baseball with your son,
have a good time.

353
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,870
It's not like you're high on Monday when
you show up for it,

354
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,980
but it'll still be in your system.
Yeah.

355
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,830
So they're,
they're making sure you're not doing

356
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:00,410
anything that they don't like when
you're not there.

357
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,150
I don't know that part of it.
I don't really care personally because I

358
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:06,680
live a clean life.
I mean,

359
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,930
I don't drink,
don't smoke,

360
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,160
don't do whatever.
I mean,

361
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,400
so they can test whatever,
but I think part of it is uh,

362
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,680
um,
it's,

363
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,620
it's one of the best places to work in
the area.

364
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,600
So they figured that,
you know,

365
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,500
part of the stipulation of working here
is you're subjected to these drug tests.

366
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,570
If you don't like it,
you don't have to work here.

367
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,980
Right.
So,

368
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,730
oh,
I get it.

369
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,560
I mean it's,
I get,

370
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,040
and I'm not saying that they're probably
not testing for pot and thinking or I'm

371
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,070
sure they are testing for pot,
but I mean it's,

372
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,410
you know,
I think they test for alcohol.

373
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,170
I think metric test for alcohol,
I think they do.

374
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,140
You have to be drunk there.
Well,

375
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,740
you'd have to be drunk out of a job.
You don't have to have a drink at lunch

376
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,093
and then they keep up

377
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,090
to do that.
That's,

378
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,040
I'm not saying people do that,
but they could.

379
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,390
But you could get hammered on Friday and
Monday be clean as a whistle.

380
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,640
Right?
Yeah.

381
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:02,890
That when they always do it is they'll
call like it.

382
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,680
You know,
I start work at seven,

383
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,300
so it'd be like 7:15 he needed,
he needed to be to wherever and 15

384
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,780
minutes.
So I think it's just they don't want

385
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:15,000
somebody out hammered drunk at three in
the morning.

386
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,750
I'd probably still show up there at
7:30.

387
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,810
Right,
totally makes sense.

388
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,280
Yeah,
that totally makes sense because yeah,

389
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:25,281
you are compromised and even if you show
up and you're stoned at work for a lot

390
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:29,100
of people that are compromised,
I understand the idea that you would

391
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:32,790
want someone to not have a drug problem.
Right?

392
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,770
Because we all know people that have had
problems for me,

393
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:38,490
like the most disturbing one has been
people that I know that a big pill

394
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,970
problems like speed and things along
those lines because a lot of the times

395
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,580
they're functional but just a little
off.

396
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,460
And if you're dealing with important
stuff,

397
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,680
right,
you could be making critical decision

398
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,050
errors and because you're impaired.
Yeah.

399
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,860
So they might have hired you based on
your critical thinking and your

400
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:58,630
reasoning,
but then that's all being compromised by

401
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:02,130
a drug and there's only one way to find
out what the fuck is going on with you

402
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,790
testing.
Yeah.

403
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,020
Yeah.
That makes sense.

404
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,460
The problem with the cannabis things to
twofold.

405
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,910
One,
it stays in your system.

406
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,530
Your you can test for it for weeks and
weeks after it's psychoactive because

407
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:18,531
it's fat soluble and two,
because this assumption that if you use

408
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:24,111
something you abuse something is not,
it's not accurate and it's only applies

409
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,610
to losers.
So like if you say,

410
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,530
well look at all these losers,
they get high every day.

411
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,180
Well yeah.
Okay.

412
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:32,000
But there are also losers.
Yeah,

413
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,100
there's a lot of responsible people.

414
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,770
But when I say losers,
I don't mean if you get high every day,

415
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:39,660
you're a loser.
I know people that get high every day

416
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:43,230
and they're super successful.
Businessman it guys.

417
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,430
I know a lot of people,
I know people that micro dose Lsd all

418
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:51,540
the time and they run multimillion
dollar businesses and they do it all the

419
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,374
time.
Yeah.

420
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,480
But their personality is such that
recreationally,

421
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:01,530
they don't have an issue,
they can do things and doesn't overwhelm

422
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:03,660
their life,
but some people can't gamble.

423
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,190
You know what I mean?
Some people,

424
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,850
like if you play poker with some people,
they'll lose their fucking mind.

425
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:10,400
Next thing you know,
they're on a flight to vegas.

426
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,170
They're going crazy and they lost their
mortgage is a disease.

427
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,890
It's a legitimate mental disease,
but not in the sense that you catch it.

428
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,731
You know,
Oh man,

429
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:18,480
I didn't wash my hands.

430
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,710
I caught Vegas.
You know,

431
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:22,860
it's not like that.
But it's a legitimate disease in the

432
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:27,861
sense that it can fuck with your mind in
a way that is almost out of your

433
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:31,920
control.
Like a cold makes your physical health

434
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:33,900
out of your control.
Like when I have a cold,

435
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,330
I get upset at myself because I'm like,
you fucking dummy.

436
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,420
You let yourself get rundown or I know
you didn't get enough sleep.

437
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,201
You didn't,
you know,

438
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,660
whatever it is.
You traveled too much and here you are.

439
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,710
Now you feel like,
shit,

440
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,800
this is stupid.
Yeah,

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,100
well that's the sort of the same thing
that happens people when they get a

442
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,510
gambling addiction,
so it's not a substance thing.

443
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,420
It's not like saying,
hey,

444
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,250
you know,
cam,

445
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,230
we're going to test you for gambling.
Did you,

446
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:57,580
uh,
when you play poker with your buddies

447
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:59,140
over the weekend,
how much did you gamble?

448
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,160
Oh,
10 bucks.

449
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,560
Too much.
You know,

450
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,220
you can't,
you can't do that to people.

451
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,740
You can't.
I think there's a,

452
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:08,110
there's a real problem with that and you
know,

453
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:10,510
I mean,
I guess you could say if you,

454
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:13,660
if it's your,
you're the employer and you know,

455
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:15,000
this is the kind of people that you
want.

456
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,470
It's up to you.
I don't,

457
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,970
I don't fucking buy that.
Yeah,

458
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,350
I don't buy that.
I say if the guy's doing a good job,

459
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,320
there should be no issues.
Right?

460
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,070
Well,
I think,

461
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,950
uh,
and I think there are a fair employer.

462
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,200
So I think even if you did test for
something,

463
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,960
um,
and you were that good employee,

464
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,423
they're gonna,
you know,

465
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,860
they're going to work through whatever
issues you're going to make.

466
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,890
You go to Rehab,
but a bunch of losers maybe in sit

467
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,820
around talking about pot.
You imagine what it's like going to a

468
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,410
rehab.
If you smoke a little weed and you get

469
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:48,160
popped at work and you got to go to a
rehab with a bunch of stone cold

470
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,770
junkies,
they're all covered in scabs,

471
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,190
clonic,
fake spiders all day and or ultra

472
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:58,240
marathon runners
were talking about that.

473
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,600
Test me after the big foot.
200 places.

474
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,540
I'm going to get you so mad.
I'm going to get you a ton of it.

475
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
I take a couple months off work after
that.

476
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,940
I'm going to um,
there was a pre workout supplement that

477
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:12,490
we were talking about on the way up here
to where they pulled it off the shelf

478
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:15,750
because they found fucking meth in it.
Straight up meth.

479
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,970
It's like a meth,
like substance that had never been

480
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,630
tested on human beings and pull this
shit off the shelves.

481
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,110
I asked Joe what it was called
[inaudible].

482
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:27,000
You know that stuff would work
right?

483
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,010
That stuff.
People get super addicted to that

484
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:31,310
though,
you know,

485
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,810
it just didn't like coffee,
like I'm probably addicted to coffee.

486
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,520
I fucking love coffee.
I love coffee.

487
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,400
Tea or coffee?
Coffee is.

488
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,210
Is.
This is caveman coffee.

489
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,800
This is some delicious roast.
What kind is this?

490
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,560
Do you remember what roasted it is?
There?

491
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:45,880
Was that saber tooth,
was it.

492
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,670
Is it the same thing?
It was the end of one,

493
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,533
I think it was at.
Yeah.

494
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,200
Yeah.
God Damn,

495
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,060
that's it.
That delicious stuff with the silver

496
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:53,170
writing.
Woo.

497
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,670
That's good stuff.
Yeah,

498
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:58,690
it's really good coffee as far as uh,
right now I'm just trying to keep my

499
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:02,440
body is pure as possible.
I'm not even doing pre workout at all

500
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:04,980
because I'm so cognizant of what my
heart's doing is.

501
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,990
I'm pushing it so hard every day and I'm
always got my heart rate monitor on.

502
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,880
Even during that,
the ultra that I just did the 24 hour we

503
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:18,580
were running fast and never got above
141 or 42 beats per minute.

504
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,710
So I mean that when I take pre workout,
obviously it's going to ramp up my heart

505
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:26,770
rate and I just,
so my work definitely doesn't have to

506
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,580
worry about anything in me right now.
I'm just trying to stay calm,

507
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,780
stay a um,
like an efficient machine out there and

508
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,820
I'm feeling feeling good actually.
That's awesome.

509
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,040
Can you imagine if you took a pre
workout and you got pot from meth to

510
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,980
work and be like,
hey cam,

511
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,590
what the fuck you doing?
Eating healthy,

512
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,620
working out,
taking super jacked formula number six.

513
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,950
Oh,
let's test that meth head.

514
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,110
We have a real issue with that in the
UFC.

515
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,680
There a real issue with guys taking
these supplements.

516
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,770
Chad Mendez is a,
one of the latest ones take these

517
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,790
supplements that you buy from stores and
these supplements turned out to have

518
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:09,791
either steroids or hormone precursors or
different peptides that make your body

519
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:14,480
develop more testosterone or more growth
hormone or different things that are

520
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,930
banned by the U.
S,

521
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,980
Ada and a super common man.

522
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,520
Super Common.
And you know,

523
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,900
a lot of people like,
you know,

524
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,420
people online would love project.
Yeah,

525
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,420
that's what it was.
It was a tainted supplement,

526
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,610
but they're actually testing these
supplements.

527
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,770
When these guys get caught.
Like A,

528
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,240
for instance,
tim means he's a perfect example.

529
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:35,450
Like he was only suspended for a very
short amount of time.

530
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:39,020
They give him six months retroactive to
the day where he got caught.

531
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,690
He was supposed to have this fucking
amazing fight with cowboy serone.

532
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:42,860
That would have been an incredible
fight.

533
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,720
Yeah.
To me it was super,

534
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,000
super skillful.
So they take a,

535
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,860
Tim means,
uh,

536
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,670
he,
he tells them what the supplement was.

537
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,520
They go to a store independently,
take it off the shelf,

538
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,330
test it,
and they go,

539
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,060
she up.
Sure enough it has a steroid in it.

540
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,720
So there's a lot of this stuff that
people are buying that they think is

541
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:00,830
safe and easy.

542
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,780
If it works like that,
you know,

543
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,470
if it's like I put on 10 pounds and
three hours,

544
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,320
there's some shit in there.
Dude,

545
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,100
it's the stuff that works,
works a little bit where it's like a

546
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,570
little bit,
you get like a little bit of an

547
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,730
advantage,
like everything is everything that's

548
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:19,880
healthy and then legal that you could
use like creatine,

549
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,140
creatine works became like a little bit,
a little bit of a bump

550
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,320
and you can add a little bit of this,
a little bit of that and this stuff

551
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:29,630
helps that netapp helped ain't take this
before you go to bed,

552
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:32,780
it'll help your,
your growth hormone increase and that

553
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,160
stuff is like little incremental little
edges.

554
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,520
It works,
it all works but a little bit.

555
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,030
Yeah,
I did that with complete nutrition.

556
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:45,020
I think it was like 2011.
They had some of that stuff and as you

557
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:46,040
know,
did a,

558
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,160
taking a few different things and uh,
it worked,

559
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,510
it totally worked.

560
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,430
I definitely put on muscle and I was
like Dang,

561
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:54,710
this stuff is awesome.
So it got done,

562
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,430
went back in there like,
oh remember that stuff that is something

563
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,230
Nova or something like that.
They're like,

564
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,340
yeah,
they pulled that,

565
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,380
that's too strong.
And I'm like,

566
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,670
oh,
so that's it.

567
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:06,050
I mean,
it definitely worked.

568
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,720
The problem was a problem with that is,
you know,

569
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,690
like a young guys especially,
they'll take whatever,

570
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,480
but that stuff is hard on your liver,
you know what I mean?

571
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:17,450
Those supplements,
I'm going through your liver like that.

572
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,960
So it's uh,
it's also hard on your balls probably.

573
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,420
I took this stuff called Mag 10 bag 10
is the most powerful thing that I ever

574
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:27,230
took.
They pulled that off the shelf.

575
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,800
Oh yeah.
You used to take 10 clear pills a day.

576
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,330
You just looked like a total pill head.
I mean,

577
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:38,630
it's like a stack of these pills and
they're clear and they probably like

578
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,540
super toxic on your liver from God.
Damn.

579
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,320
Did I get dragged to.
Did it work?

580
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,550
Oh my God.
Yeah.

581
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,361
But it's,
you know,

582
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:50,240
you're manipulating your hormones.
Yeah.

583
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,610
And it's tricky doing that is tricky
because you have to really be concerned

584
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:58,611
with taxing your endocrine system.
Your endocrine system shuts down because

585
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,041
it's like,
well,

586
00:26:59,041 --> 00:26:59,970
this,
why does this guy have,

587
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,350
you know,
all this God damn extra testosterone.

588
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:03,540
A system.
I guess we don't have to make

589
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,610
testosterone anymore,
so balls crash.

590
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,190
So your balls take a break and when you
balls go on vacation then it takes like

591
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:11,750
a couple of weeks for them to get back
up to speed after you're up,

592
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,860
you're done.
Because if you're on that stuff,

593
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:15,960
like say if you're on for like six
weeks,

594
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:21,060
I think they say it takes like at least
three for your body to get back to

595
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:22,710
normal.
We bought it to let go.

596
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,620
Whew.
Okay.

597
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,320
Really looks like a,
you know,

598
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,480
it's like your balls are like a haunted
house.

599
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,360
Like everybody goes in and shines a
flashlight around.

600
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:30,860
We.
Okay,

601
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,170
we'll go back to business now.
What the fuck was going on in here?

602
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,750
Is this guy taking,
you know,

603
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:39,360
your body's not used to you taking
something.

604
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,420
It's processed through your digestive
system and it's testosterone and all of

605
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:46,110
a sudden you're like,
what is this?

606
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,060
Where's it coming from?
Why is it coming from the liver?

607
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,490
Right?
What is this shit getting absorbed by

608
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:55,380
your stomach and your intestines?
This crazy testosterone stuff.

609
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,210
You know,
it's better just eat elk.

610
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,400
That helps.
That does help.

611
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,280
Yeah.
There's a bunch of different foods that

612
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,250
are apparently,
um,

613
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,040
that,
uh,

614
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,400
that are high in or that make your body
produce more testosterone.

615
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,420
Here's an interesting thing that a lot
of people are finding when they're going

616
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:16,590
on ketogenic diets,
and this is several people including me,

617
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,630
that I have done this where once you
start going on these ketogenic diets and

618
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:24,180
you get your testosterone tested,
and this is people that are on

619
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:28,230
testosterone replacement and people that
are not on testosterone replacement.

620
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,580
I've had three different friends who
have similar results where your test

621
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:37,581
just gets Jack.
So what turns out that fats are one of

622
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:42,771
the most important things like healthy
fats and essential fatty acids and,

623
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,800
um,
and even saturated fats and cholesterol

624
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,840
is one of the most important things for
your body to convert to testosterone,

625
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,430
for your body,
to produce testosterone.

626
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,110
It needs those precursors and needs
those,

627
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,570
those important important aspects of
nutrition.

628
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,110
Which is really interesting because for
so long people thought that low fat

629
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:04,910
diets were healthy and low fat was the
way to go.

630
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,070
Low Fat will make you have more energy.
You'll be healthier.

631
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,530
But it turns out that's not necessarily
true and it's weird because like what

632
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:16,890
was like doctrine 20 years ago or 10
years ago,

633
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,720
right now,
like a wound that's not the case.

634
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,930
You know,
I was reading my kid a book Dr Seuss

635
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,830
Book and it was a nutrition pyramid at
the bottom of the pyramid.

636
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,650
Like the most important shit was bread
and it was like bread and grains like

637
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:31,630
that is not.
No,

638
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,750
no,
no.

639
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,710
Where's the vegetables?
Right.

640
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,760
Why is that fucking.
Why is the bottom useless?

641
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,950
Calories like pasta.
That's so stupid.

642
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,180
Yeah.
And that's exactly.

643
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,700
People just pound that stuff in the
evenings and wonder why they can't lose

644
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,460
weight.
Yeah.

645
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,730
You know,
that's the biggest thing is those late

646
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,580
night carbs aren't getting burned up.
Well,

647
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,400
it gets converted to sugar and it also,
there's the insulin,

648
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,470
that's the real issue is a giant issue
with your body getting this insulin

649
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:04,230
spike and it's just not good for you.
It's just not good to have that much God

650
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:07,000
damn sugar.
It doesn't exist in nature in that form.

651
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,870
So we have developed these very weird
bodies,

652
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,750
you know,
and ever since I've been on this

653
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,050
high fat,
low sugar kick,

654
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,720
I've always,
always aware that people are overweight.

655
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,850
So it's natural.
You see it everywhere,

656
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,890
no big deal.
But it's stunning when you really start

657
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,110
taking an actual,
like an inventory started looking around

658
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:33,430
at all these people I know,
belly fat and fat,

659
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,420
neck,
fat,

660
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,710
arm,
fat and we're capable of so much.

661
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,900
And then you see people who,
you know,

662
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:44,170
and I understand people are going
through things or challenges that have

663
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,240
different challenges in their life.
I get it,

664
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,520
but our bodies are so amazing.
They don't have to let them get to that

665
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,150
stage for sure.
It's uh,

666
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,400
it's unfortunate because it's so hard to
change once you're at that stage,

667
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,520
it's so hard and you feel terrible.
You feel.

668
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,190
And again,
this is me talking about marathon

669
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:05,530
runners and talking shit.
I've never gotten enormously obese,

670
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,790
but I would imagine I've gotten fat
enough for.

671
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,160
I'm disgusted with myself.
Yeah.

672
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,150
And that's like,
you know,

673
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,770
10 pounds overweight.
Right?

674
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,500
But I think it just,
it's,

675
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,390
they feel like it's too much work.
It's almost like the idea of running an

676
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,221
ultra marathon,
so.

677
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:21,640
Right,
losing 100 pounds.

678
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,370
So much work.
It's no different.

679
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,040
So when you run an ultra marathon,
you don't think about you're running 100

680
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,180
miles,
you break it down.

681
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,080
I mean,
and so that's the same thing with losing

682
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,480
weight.
You can't think about,

683
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,770
hey,
I need to lose 100 pounds.

684
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,220
They think about winning that day right
now.

685
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,450
What are you going to do today?
And then you can worry about tomorrow,

686
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:40,120
tomorrow.
But somebody asked me like,

687
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:45,121
how do you stay in that a cryogenic
chamber for three minutes at 250 degrees

688
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:46,720
below zero.
I said,

689
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,280
I just count the 63 times.
Yeah.

690
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,171
And they're like,
that's it.

691
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:50,621
I go,
yeah,

692
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:53,020
that's all I do.
I can't go one,

693
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,580
two,
three,

694
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,580
and I get to 60 and I go,
we're done with one one.

695
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:00,640
And then I do it again.
And then by the time I get to the third

696
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:04,170
minute of just I'm shivering,
but I'm just counting to 60.

697
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,850
It's not that hard if you play a little
game,

698
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,860
right?
Well it's no different.

699
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:11,050
So if you wanted to try to do 25 reps in
the gym,

700
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:12,940
you don't do 25,
you five sets of five.

701
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,130
Exactly.
So you just break that down.

702
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,990
Everybody has every,
you know,

703
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:19,510
people are different.
People break things down differently.

704
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,440
Um,
you know,

705
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:23,350
I've been thinking about this big foot
$200 raise and I'm thinking well maybe I

706
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:25,840
should break it into 50 mile races,
you know,

707
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,930
just break it down for fifties,
try to get it done.

708
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:32,870
So it's a logical gates,
whatever.

709
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,330
I do that when I do the Hindu squats,
I do 210 do squats and the way I do it

710
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,030
as I do them by tens,
I just just do it and I have a clicker

711
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,360
so I can't cheat because you will
fucking forget while you're in the

712
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:45,021
middle of that,
you're like,

713
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:47,120
what am I,
I'm 30 and my authority or have to look

714
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,740
at the clicker.
So I count.

715
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,290
And then at the end I checked the
clicker to make sure I'm right.

716
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,270
There you go.
But I break it down in tens.

717
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,900
I just do 10 and then I do 10 more.
Twenty and then,

718
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,280
uh,
do it like that.

719
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,190
I think of it as each one being,
uh,

720
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,110
a 10 squat increment.
So then I'm going to get through.

721
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:07,400
It doesn't seem so daunting that I do 10
squats and I have 90 or 192 go.

722
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,780
I think of it as just each little 10,
10 squat little event that I'm going to

723
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:13,880
do.
Here's another 10 squad.

724
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,100
Yvette,
here's not intense.

725
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:17,150
Quite event,
but that's nothing.

726
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,350
That's not paying well compared to what
you're doing.

727
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,930
Yeah.
Are also taking a fucking rock and throw

728
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,200
it into a backpack.
Running up the hill.

729
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,200
That's ridiculous to not not running,
but yeah.

730
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,680
No,
it's because you're doing that now

731
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:34,770
though,
you know,

732
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,050
a lot of guys are not with your rock the
way you do it,

733
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,410
but many guys are taking sandbags and
packing them down just like they would

734
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,933
like if they were trying to.

735
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,860
If you had a heavy backpack and you
have,

736
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,660
you know,
seven miles to go to get back to the

737
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,850
truck,
there's nothing you can do,

738
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:55,520
but walk those God damn seven miles,
that heavy backpack,

739
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,830
it's not going to get out on his own.
No,

740
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,773
no,
and that's,

741
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,500
that's the thing is like,
that's just hard manual labor,

742
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,020
that's all there is to it.
I mean when you start hunting elk in the

743
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,770
back country or even deer in the back
country or whatever your bear,

744
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,750
you got to get that thing back to the
truck.

745
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,790
And so some,
there's some guys who can just boost it,

746
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,310
who don't train,
who can just say,

747
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:19,460
well,
I'll take some time and I'll get it out.

748
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:22,640
There's a few guys who can,
who can do that and just one step at a

749
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,280
time type thing.
Most guys have to train to be in that

750
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:25,970
position.

751
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,050
You know?
Most guys.

752
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:27,950
Yeah,
without a doubt.

753
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:28,843
It's,
it's,

754
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,490
it's very physically taxing.
You went to,

755
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:34,100
you and I were in Colorado and we packed
out that bowl.

756
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:34,461
Did,
what?

757
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:38,150
Did we walk like maybe six tenths of a
mile?

758
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

759
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Mad most three quarters of a mile,
quarter mile at most records a mile and

760
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,820
you know,
we only had like 100 pounds on and

761
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,030
imagine like,
I think remy was the one who was talking

762
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:56,540
about it.
Remy Warren of the fabulous a show.

763
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,270
Apex Predator.
He was on the podcast talking about how

764
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:02,840
he had a pack or Moose out,
I think it was a moose seven miles.

765
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:06,230
Yeah.
And at the end he was just broken for

766
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,450
like months because his body was just
dead.

767
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,550
All I know it's it,
you know,

768
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:13,220
when I killed that Moose up in Alaska
with Roy,

769
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,820
you know,
our last time together a moose and that

770
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:19,670
was up over a big ridge into another
canyon.

771
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,730
It was four miles.
It wasn't seven like roomies,

772
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,930
but,
um,

773
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,460
it,
it was 600 pounds of meat.

774
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,610
So how are you going to get 600 pounds
of meat?

775
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,560
I mean,
it's going to be 100 pounds at a time

776
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:34,970
and up over the hill and Jesus Christ,
it's a grind.

777
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:35,804
But,
uh,

778
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,920
you know,
through snow down we walked,

779
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,280
really thought it'd be.
It was a better route just to go down

780
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:43,230
the creek,
like walk in the creek.

781
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,070
Yeah,
I,

782
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,550
I came up the,
the ridge.

783
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,310
He hadn't been in there that way,
up kind of up the ridge,

784
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,070
staying out of the creek.
He'd always come up the creek because if

785
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:55,890
you know,
really the hardest possible way to do

786
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:57,360
things,
that's how he wanted to do it.

787
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,830
So our first load out,
we were walking down the creek,

788
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,330
just feet,
you know,

789
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,990
if you ever mentioned walking into a
creek with 100 and some pounds on your

790
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:08,930
back,
you're the,

791
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,460
the elders are catching your backpack.
I mean,

792
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,080
it's exhausting.
So on the way back in,

793
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,933
I'm like,
dude,

794
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,860
we gotta stay up on that Ridge.
You're gonna,

795
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,440
you're gonna.
Love the ridge.

796
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,860
And it was just like,
probably five times easier.

797
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,950
Why would

798
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,950
walking in the creek be good?
The only thing I could think of is if

799
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,290
you were so hot from carrying all that
weight,

800
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,580
that it would cool you off a little bit,

801
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,110
but then you'd be wet now.
What his thought was,

802
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,100
uh,
you know,

803
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,480
there's so many,
so much.

804
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,900
The brush is so thick,
so if you're not fighting brush,

805
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:41,220
if you're in the creek,
you know,

806
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,890
usually the creek is pretty open.
He had cut,

807
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,330
he had cut it.
Um,

808
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,430
some of the brush has grown over the
creek out of the way,

809
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:50,580
so he sort of had a trail cut in there
and he came in there that the year

810
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:52,530
before he,
I think he killed a bull back in there,

811
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,540
so we sorta had a trail cut in there,
but the rocky walking in the creek with

812
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:59,820
the slipping and sliding and everything
else just,

813
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,863
it was,
uh,

814
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,980
it wasn't,
it.

815
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,620
We went on the road and he's like,
wow,

816
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:05,490
this is way better.

817
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,380
Reno is brother fucked as backup.
So bad that he had a by llamas.

818
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,680
Yeah.
He was carrying on an elk and apparently

819
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:18,970
he just fucked as backup.
Just Rinella in his brothers.

820
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,520
They're all savages.
They're all relentless.

821
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,920
Sure.
There are these fucking hill climbing

822
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:27,940
psycho goat people that just don't get
tired and they just push each other.

823
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:31,750
And I'm sure growing up they all pushed
each other like knowing Rinella and then

824
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:34,180
hearing the story about his brother.
I'm sure they're basically the same way.

825
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,290
And that I think he just said fucking
tough enough pussy.

826
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,990
And he kept going.
Just his back was just jacked.

827
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,370
So then he got llamas.
So now he takes these llamas in a van.

828
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,250
And when he drives,
he has these llamas.

829
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:49,900
Pack the meat out for them.
Yeah,

830
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,910
we hit me and really had llamas.
We bought Llamas for $100 a piece for

831
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,670
the exact same thing.
What is it like keeping a Llama?

832
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,380
You don't hardly have to deal with
anything real.

833
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:02,060
I mean,
when you pay $100 for them,

834
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,980
who cares?
So locked up,

835
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,990
falafel,
a poor slave lama.

836
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,850
No,
no,

837
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:14,110
but they're really hardy animals and
they can't pack,

838
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,420
you know,
they can't pack like a horse can pack.

839
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,780
But.
So if they packed 70 pounds and you've

840
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:20,770
got four of them,
well there's 280 pounds.

841
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:22,260
You're not packing on your back,
you know,

842
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,250
that adds up.
So that's all we had them.

843
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,170
And uh,
they would pack,

844
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,260
even if they didn't pack much meat,
they'd pack our camp and we could take

845
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:32,590
extra food and things like that.
So we'd go in the wilderness with our

846
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:37,170
four llamas and uh,
it was great and they just like hang

847
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:39,460
out.
Like they don't get cold now and they

848
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:41,530
don't need water either.
They're sorta like camels.

849
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,610
What?
Yeah,

850
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,810
you don't even have to worry about water
with horses when you have horses in the

851
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:47,644
back country.

852
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,820
A wrangling the horses is like a whole
different responsibility,

853
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,790
a whole extra responsibility.
You have to make sure they have water,

854
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,690
you have to,
you know,

855
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,580
feed,
they can kind of figure it out in the

856
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:59,890
high country,
but they have to get water every day,

857
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,260
you know,
so you can't be gone from camp with,

858
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,610
for an extended periods with llamas.
Who Cares?

859
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,350
Remy was on a horse hunt and they were
riding a horse and uh,

860
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,120
one of the guys was on the horse and the
horse fell and snapped his leg.

861
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,330
The horse broke,
his leg was broken,

862
00:39:18,331 --> 00:39:19,570
his leg.
And uh,

863
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,790
the guide just said,
all right,

864
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,680
well everybody back up.
Shoot the horse and so remy was like,

865
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,680
well,
this seems like it just kind of like

866
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,960
leave it here.
Yeah.

867
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,860
So he cut the backstraps off of it.
Off The horse.

868
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:33,694
Off The horse.

869
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

870
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,400
That have.
I mean,

871
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,690
thank you.
Cooked it too.

872
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:40,930
Did he say he cooked it?
I know I,

873
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,730
I had endorsed before.
Yeah.

874
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,190
I had horse.
Had An amazing restaurant in Montreal.

875
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,890
Joe Beef twice,
two different occasions.

876
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,640
They served as horse one time.
It was a.

877
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,493
You were like,
yeah,

878
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,000
no,
I wouldn't personally,

879
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:57,820
I wouldn't eat what I've seen horses
dead in the back country.

880
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,710
Same thing.
You wouldn't eat a horse.

881
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,600
Probably not.
Like if somebody,

882
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:04,870
if you went to a restaurant,
sucks super fancy restaurants like Joe

883
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,230
beef and they served you a horse
tenderloin,

884
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,890
I'd say,
Hey,

885
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,250
could I get that filet?
You wouldn't,

886
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,380
you wouldn't try it.
Probably not really to just try it.

887
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,220
I,
I was,

888
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,960
you know,
I grew up around horses.

889
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,250
I love horses.
Uh,

890
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,140
have written a lot.
And I remember I was hunting in

891
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:26,530
Australia with Adam Green tree and they
call them Brumby's back there.

892
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,740
So it's just wild horses.
And we were sitting there under a tree

893
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:33,610
is hot is,
I mean 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

894
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:36,220
It's crazy hot.
We're just sitting there boiling.

895
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,220
Here's this white stallion coming up
Rhombi.

896
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,880
And Adam's like,
oh that's,

897
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,430
that's a beautiful trophy and a this
whore.

898
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,500
What a beautiful trophy to shoot.
Yeah,

899
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,350
they shoot them.
But yes,

900
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,780
they're wild horses.
So was just a trophy.

901
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,210
What a weird way to look at a horse.
Well that's,

902
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,620
that's why people hunt,
right?

903
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,530
Is it for food?
I mean,

904
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:00,420
does he eat?
The horse

905
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,720
wasn't going to do with the horse I
shot.

906
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,750
People are going to be like fucking
psycho now.

907
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,730
The thing in Australia is all those are
feral animals,

908
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:11,380
so they need to be killed,
you know?

909
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,960
So there's no law that says you need to
take the meat off.

910
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,030
Whatever you kill.
They just want the animal's dead.

911
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,310
It was so strange.
There's too many of them.

912
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,640
I mean they'll,
they'll fly over a parks and just wipe

913
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,970
out the buffalo,
the water buffalo because they just

914
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,560
ruined all the water sources.
There's,

915
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,990
they don't get killed.
There's way too many of them.

916
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:33,800
They were introduced there from Asia and
so they need the numbers control.

917
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,920
They need them gone basically.
So yeah,

918
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:39,740
I mean a wild horse,
same thing.

919
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,850
Their um,
their sensibilities are so contrary to

920
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,340
ours.
When you think about what hunting is

921
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:48,050
over here and went hunting is over
there,

922
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,900
like for people that are like aghast
listening to this,

923
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,760
by the way,
Adam is fucking awesome.

924
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,220
I love this guy.
He's not a slight against him.

925
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,330
No,
he's amazing.

926
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:59,780
But his environment is very different
than our environment and this is what's

927
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:02,540
different.
Australia didn't have hardly any

928
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,840
animals.
I mean like Kangaroos and wallabies and

929
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:09,530
some weird shit,
but all the animals that they have there

930
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,180
have been introduced and they've made
some big mistakes along the way.

931
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,040
Yeah.
And one of the big mistakes was they

932
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:20,780
brought over foxes and they brought over
cats and uh,

933
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,740
this was a huge mistake because they
have wild cat everywhere.

934
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,970
Everywhere in Australia.

935
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,930
House cats,
right?

936
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,280
Regular.
Like house cats,

937
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:31,040
except they're wild as fuck.
And they kill everything.

938
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:34,940
They decimate ground nesting birds.
The ground nesting birds just go

939
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:36,070
extinct.
Like there's just,

940
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,800
they have no chance.
And cats are fucking murderers.

941
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,630
We've,
we've talked about this on the podcast

942
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:42,610
because we did this.
Uh,

943
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,640
we,
we read this study that was done

944
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,520
recently on how many animals cats killed
per year.

945
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,320
I have two cats.
I love cats.

946
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,300
They're awesome.
I've always had,

947
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,530
I've had cats my whole life.
I love cats.

948
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,180
So not a slight against cats.
Yeah,

949
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,580
they killed billions.
Billions.

950
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,840
I mean Bei Bei every year in America,
just in the US,

951
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:08,610
the fucking murderers and killed in
rodents and squirrels and birds.

952
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,820
They fucking killed everything.
So in Australian hunting magazines,

953
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,670
these guys are holding up cats.
Yeah.

954
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,600
Like with smiles on their face,
like they just shot a coyote or some,

955
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,690
you know,
murderous of willdabeast thing.

956
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,770
Not a wildebeest.
What's up?

957
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,270
Hold the piece.
Wouldn't be murderers,

958
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,040
some animal that you have to kill,
you know,

959
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,770
but they're,
they're holding up a fucking cat.

960
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:31,700
And you're like,
what?

961
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,660
Like he said,
he gave me one of his magazines while

962
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:35,750
these Australian Max.
Yeah.

963
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,600
I'm like,
this is cat killers incorporated.

964
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:40,190
Look what the fuck kind of magazines is
this.

965
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,620
A bunch of guys smiling with pictures of
cats.

966
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,050
Yeah.
But in their world,

967
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,820
right,
like this is a necessary thing,

968
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,900
like they have to kill these cats just
to keep the population and they're still

969
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,940
barely putting a dent in it.
Oh yeah.

970
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,890
Now.
And so the,

971
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,440
the end of my story is here comes this
white stallion,

972
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,900
20 yards.
Perfect.

973
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,080
And couldn't shoot it.
Yeah.

974
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,060
Couldn't do it.
Fuck that.

975
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,530
Can't kill a horse.
I mean,

976
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:07,364
I know.
Weird.

977
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,960
I haven't,
you know,

978
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,410
zebras are fairly close to horses and
appearance,

979
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:13,820
you know,
couldn't.

980
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,140
I've never hunted the zebra either.
I've been to Africa multiple times and

981
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,550
you know,
so anyway,

982
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:20,390
it's just,
you know,

983
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:20,710
I'm,
I'm,

984
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,540
I'm not trying to judge anybody for
doing it.

985
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,900
I'm just saying for me,
Rinella had a really good take on this

986
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:29,550
whole cecil the lion thing.
And uh,

987
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,340
one of the things that he was saying is
as a hunter

988
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,233
who?
Cecil,

989
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,640
that's that guy,
the dude,

990
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,710
he had a brother named Jericho,
but his take on it was that as a person

991
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:45,880
who goes out and takes a life and,
and,

992
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,870
and does this like in a sort of a public
manner,

993
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,660
like you have an obligation to consume
that animal.

994
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,310
And so I was saying to him like,
well,

995
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,410
if you go over to Africa,
and he's like,

996
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:57,690
well I've never been Africa and I don't
have a desire to go to Africa,

997
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:00,750
but if I did and I shot a line,
I'd eat that line.

998
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,980
I go,
you would.

999
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,351
He goes,
yeah,

1000
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,490
I'd eat that line.
Yeah.

1001
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,850
So he won't,
he won't shoot anything unless you eat

1002
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:06,480
it.
Okay.

1003
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,480
And he's um,
he's actually been on many grizzly

1004
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,443
hunts.
Yeah.

1005
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,320
But he won't haunt coastal grizzlies
because he doesn't want a grizzly that's

1006
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,220
been eaten fish.
He wants an inland grizzly.

1007
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,560
It would be brown bear when it's coastal
and inland.

1008
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,394
What's Grizzly?
Right?

1009
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,440
So he wants an animal that is,
you know,

1010
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,720
most likely eating berries or whatever.
So he can,

1011
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,670
he can actually eat it.
It's good.

1012
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,650
It's a good way to look at it.
Yeah,

1013
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:34,040
I mean he could still eat the coastal,
I mean,

1014
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,940
Holy Hell No.
I've eaten black bear that eat fish and

1015
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:39,780
they're okay.
You know,

1016
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,490
at Prince of Wales Island,
uh,

1017
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,270
those blackberry salmon,
just like a grizzly and totally

1018
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,210
different than like an Alberta black
bear.

1019
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,780
Uh,
Albert,

1020
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,660
Alberta black bear really good because
their grain fed,

1021
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,390
it's like a grin.
Grain Fed beef,

1022
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,440
right?
Um,

1023
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,980
but you know,
that's like a white tail deer that lives

1024
00:45:58,981 --> 00:45:59,960
near a farm.
Yeah.

1025
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,880
Like if you get white tailed deer that
lived near a farm,

1026
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,970
mean they're eating Monsanto,
GMO corn,

1027
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,970
right?
Yeah,

1028
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,540
just Kinda,
you know,

1029
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:09,480
look,
it's nature,

1030
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,730
it's nature,
it's organic,

1031
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,710
it's guaranteed.

1032
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,880
That's good meat.
It's delicious.

1033
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,720
But my buddy doug,
who's got a farm in Wisconsin,

1034
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:21,080
Doug during shout out to my buddy doug,
uh,

1035
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,390
his,
he has this amazing place in Wisconsin

1036
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:26,410
in the driftless area.
You know,

1037
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:31,540
where Cazenovia is.
I down about 90 minutes or so outside of

1038
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,880
a.
What is the Madison I guess?

1039
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,590
Yeah,
about 90 minutes outside of Madison,

1040
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,290
somewhere around there,
but just as stunning place.

1041
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,460
Beautiful.
And anyway,

1042
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:42,310
these deer,
they're,

1043
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,820
they're essentially almost like farm
animals.

1044
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,870
Yeah.
And they live in conjunction with people

1045
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:53,000
like their numbers have never been
higher and one of the reasons is because

1046
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,590
we have these enormous farm areas,
like if you,

1047
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,370
if it was like people who are not aware,
if you look at the United States,

1048
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,570
if you look at the areas that are known
for being agriculturally strong,

1049
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,670
like Kansas,
Iowa,

1050
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,620
those are where all the bucks are.
Yeah.

1051
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,200
That's where all the deer are.
If you go to those places.

1052
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:11,640
Great Habitat.
Yeah.

1053
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:16,140
I mean they live healthy and happy
because of these farms.

1054
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:19,350
Yeah.
So they're almost farm animals in some

1055
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:20,880
weird way.
A little bit.

1056
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,980
I mean there's no,
they're not fenced in now.

1057
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,590
Not fenced in,
but it's a lot of work.

1058
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:26,550
They're tuned in,
man.

1059
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:28,490
They're fucking ears are going left and
right.

1060
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,230
They're looking for everybody there.
Keep

1061
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,010
an eye on predators are notoriously
skittish.

1062
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:34,300
Yeah,
they're tuned in.

1063
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,970
They are very aware that their desired.
Yeah.

1064
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,930
Someone's trying to jack them to just
like in the really big ones.

1065
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,600
It's an interesting thing.
Um,

1066
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,190
they don't come out in the daytime.

1067
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,400
A lot of times they're only weaknesses.
The rut when it's breeding season.

1068
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,700
And so then that's when that's a chink
in their armor.

1069
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:53,840
So they're,
they want to breed,

1070
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:55,880
they want to find that hot,
that dough that's in the heat.

1071
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:57,590
It sounds like you in estrus

1072
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:58,980
and you too,
Jamie.

1073
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,350
I'm judging everybody.
It sounds like everybody.

1074
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:05,490
But when you point at somebody,
you know there's four fingers pointing

1075
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,370
back at you.
Not The way I point.

1076
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,590
I point gangster style.
Oh,

1077
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,680
this says all fire at Jamie and you at
some point I'm pointing to the devil.

1078
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:19,230
My thumb pointing to you with my finger
and my other fingers are going to Jamie.

1079
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,140
Well judge a way that makes you feel
better.

1080
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,030
It does.
It's weird how it works that way.

1081
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,790
It makes me feel way better.
They got better than people.

1082
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:31,730
I just like to not look at my own fault
at all and I just,

1083
00:48:31,731 --> 00:48:33,750
it makes me feel super comfortable.
Right.

1084
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,080
All I focus on is my fault.
So I'd like to.

1085
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,020
I'd like to try your noble.
So Noble,

1086
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,100
it seems like a lot of work,
but at these areas in our country that

1087
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:52,101
are primarily agricultural areas that
have these massive deer populations,

1088
00:48:53,101 --> 00:48:56,940
that is the number one most hunted
animal in North America as white tail

1089
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,670
deer,
most desired animal in America.

1090
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,710
It's interesting how a mule deer,
which are also spectacular animals,

1091
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:09,711
but conversely are almost totally wild.
These are mountain animals and nail the

1092
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,360
occasion to go into fields and stuff
too.

1093
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:15,700
And near farms for sure.
But uh,

1094
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,450
finding a lot of these animals,
like they're just totally,

1095
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:22,290
completely wild.
And for some people those animals,

1096
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:26,280
because of the fact they're wild,
become like a more desirable animal.

1097
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,600
Um,
it's like,

1098
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:31,210
uh,
the mountains are,

1099
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:36,100
I don't want to say Romanticize,
but people look at the mountains

1100
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:37,210
differently.
It seems like,

1101
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,760
you know,
just just being in the mountains is

1102
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:42,670
powerful in itself.
So when you're hunting an animal that is

1103
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:44,350
a mountain monarch,
so to speak,

1104
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,240
a big bull elk,
sheep,

1105
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,900
a very noble animal that lives
exclusively in the mountains and a

1106
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,250
mountain mule deer in bowhunters know.
Especially,

1107
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,470
you know,
I don't want to say I was going to say

1108
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:59,350
Western boners no,
but any bowhunter knows that tries to go

1109
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:03,420
after a mule deer and the mountains.
That's about as tough of a bow hunters

1110
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,210
you're going to get.
I mean because elk,

1111
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,480
for me,
I've killed most of my bowls.

1112
00:50:09,481 --> 00:50:13,090
Spa and stock.
I'm not calling them in and to stock and

1113
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:18,091
elk is pretty easy.
I'm just compared to a mule deer.

1114
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:20,210
Not Easy in general.
Just,

1115
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,450
you know,
not like easy as going to a store and

1116
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,430
buying a pop,
but easy,

1117
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,310
easy to get close to them.
Yeah.

1118
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,190
See,
compared to mule deer because

1119
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,440
they're.
They make noise themselves,

1120
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,740
so they're big animals.
Eight hundred pounds kicking rocks,

1121
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,530
break and branches,
so they're making noises so you can get

1122
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:40,760
away with some noise.
If a mule deer is laying up and it's bad

1123
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,450
on top of a rim rock,
all it is is laying there at the back

1124
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,210
protected because it's backed up against
a rock wall and it's looking down this,

1125
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,160
the winds coming up so it can smell
everything that's below him.

1126
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:55,850
Nothing you can get at them from behind
them and they're with their big ears,

1127
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:56,480
you know,
that's what,

1128
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,140
that's why they got the name mule deer.
They're uh,

1129
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,130
they're big ears.
They're just listening.

1130
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:05,990
All they're doing is observing,
smelling the wind and listening very,

1131
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:09,140
very hard to get in bell range of.
Yeah,

1132
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,310
that's a weird animal,
man.

1133
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,220
It's uh,
it's interesting how they move to they

1134
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:15,980
bounce,
you know,

1135
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:20,900
like a lot of animals are running deer,
white tail deer mostly Kinda run.

1136
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,010
But mule deer are literally bouncing up
in the air,

1137
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:27,620
like some sort of a cartoon rabbit.
Yeah.

1138
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,810
Point point.
I don't know.

1139
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,460
I guess I've never even,
you know,

1140
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:32,810
obviously I know that because I've seen
it.

1141
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,870
I've spooked plenty of mule deer,
but uh,

1142
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,560
I don't know if it's to get up and to
have a better view of what might have

1143
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:44,810
spoke to them or what danger might be
there to be high.

1144
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:47,270
I don't know.
I'd be interesting to find out why

1145
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,040
there's any theories on why they do
that.

1146
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,410
They kind of make sense.
If they live in fields,

1147
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,580
which a lot of them do,
there's,

1148
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,770
there goes one Boeing,
look at them go boing.

1149
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,000
Boing,
boing,

1150
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,650
boing.
What a weird animal.

1151
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,770
That's fucking weird is a Weirdo.
They do that.

1152
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,890
They this very strange look at the size
of his ears.

1153
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,410
Yup.
Have you never seen a mule deer before

1154
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:06,740
folks?

1155
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,440
They have ears that are just enormous.
Yeah.

1156
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,800
And he's bouncing,
pining towards a good book and they're

1157
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,060
huge.
Yeah.

1158
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:14,894
They.
Um,

1159
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:19,580
and that's actually so an achilles heel
of a mule deer is those ears if it's

1160
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:24,581
windy because all the hair in their ear.
So if the wind is really blowing and the

1161
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:28,370
grass where they're bedded is blowing
around or that even the wind is blowing

1162
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:30,260
the hair on their ears around,
they can't hear.

1163
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,430
So if it's windy,
you can get close to them.

1164
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,600
Uh,
if it's dead calm,

1165
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,340
Foxville,
it's not going to be easy.

1166
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,450
But if it's windy that's uh,
that's one way.

1167
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,890
You know,
if I'm bowhunting,

1168
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,600
if I had the wind right and it's
gusting,

1169
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,830
I feel pretty good,
pretty good.

1170
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,710
I can get in.
It is interesting too that these animals

1171
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:56,711
that are more difficult to get to,
and this is a one thing that is contrary

1172
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:59,210
to the way a lot of people think about
hunting,

1173
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,120
lease at the highest level,
the animals that are the most difficult

1174
00:53:05,121 --> 00:53:08,090
to get to in the hunts that are most
difficult or the most prized,

1175
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,510
and it's one of the reasons why people
like you gravitate towards bowhunting

1176
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:16,550
because bowhunting is far more difficult
than rifle hunting and then the animals

1177
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:20,810
that are the most difficult to bowhunt
become the most prized for a lot of

1178
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:23,930
people like wild desert,
bighorn sheep.

1179
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,190
They'll stone sheep,

1180
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,290
dall sheep.
When you have to go to these really

1181
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,380
crazy places that are really high up in
the mountains,

1182
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:35,700
very difficult to get there in the first
place and then good luck sneaking up on

1183
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:38,490
them.
Your wide out in the open on this

1184
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:43,491
gigantic mountain with all this shale
and rocks and I mean those are the

1185
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:48,621
animals that people prize.
In some strange way that these hunters

1186
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:54,030
like the difficulty of the hunt,
the tougher it is to camp out there.

1187
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,260
The difficulty in the conditions that
tough for those conditions are the more

1188
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:02,100
people sort of like pro like praise
those kinds of experiences.

1189
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,430
It's the challenge.
It's what it's why we bow hunt.

1190
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,960
Um,
and that's just a,

1191
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,770
that's just a prime example of the
greatest challenge there is,

1192
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,150
you know,
in the mountains in those tough

1193
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:14,580
conditions with a bow.
Um,

1194
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,530
yeah,
it's hard as it get.

1195
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:22,530
So we bow hunt because we like challenge
and we put those animals on pedestals

1196
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:25,020
because they're the ultimate challenge.
Yeah.

1197
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:27,950
And it's for people that don't hunt,
they don't,

1198
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,360
they probably are not,
not only they're not aware of this,

1199
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:35,361
but it might not even make that much
sense that this is one of the reasons

1200
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:37,860
why those animals are like people
saying,

1201
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:38,440
Oh,
you know,

1202
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,290
it doesn't like how many times do I read
this?

1203
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:41,910
It doesn't take any skill.
You know,

1204
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:45,570
what you're doing is horrible entirely.
It's one of the most difficult things

1205
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:49,590
you could do in the world if you want to
try to feed yourself with a bow and an

1206
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:50,590
Arrow,
a stick,

1207
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:52,380
and a string.
You want to try to feed yourself with

1208
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:53,100
that?
Yeah.

1209
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,030
Good luck.
Yeah.

1210
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,940
The people that say there's no skill
involved in bowhunting,

1211
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,010
haven't done it.
They definitely happen,

1212
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:00,860
but it's also,
it's,

1213
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,960
it's in a can in inconsiderate
convenient way of dismissing something

1214
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:12,270
that they don't agree with because of
their ideology and with a lot of the

1215
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:13,104
people.

1216
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,690
There are people that eat meat,
which is really weird.

1217
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,700
It's like you're eating meat and you're
dismissing someone who's doing one of

1218
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:22,790
the most difficult things in the world
with meat.

1219
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,813
Yeah.
Well,

1220
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,890
I guarantee you.
No,

1221
00:55:25,891 --> 00:55:28,020
I know there's people out there who
don't hunt who,

1222
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,700
um,
respect animals.

1223
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,223
No,
I get that.

1224
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,880
But those people could never have the
same amount of respect.

1225
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,960
I don't think as a hunter who knows what
it takes to survive up there,

1226
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,060
what it takes to outwit the animal up
there,

1227
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:44,410
what it takes to be successful and to
get that,

1228
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,730
that the meat off the mountain after
you've harvested one.

1229
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,540
The amount of respect.
That whole process builds in a hunter.

1230
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,630
There's no way.
Somebody who hasn't done it could

1231
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:59,520
appreciate or match.
I don't know whether or not they could

1232
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:04,350
appreciate it as much.
I just don't think they understand the

1233
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,860
experience.

1234
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:09,860
I don't think they understand the beauty
that some people find in that experience

1235
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:12,870
because I think in their eyes,
if you take life,

1236
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:16,050
this is a negative thing,
a terrible thing,

1237
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,350
but the way I always kind of look at it
like that,

1238
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,040
there's a storm going on out there.
Okay.

1239
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,240
Close Your door.
Watch game of thrones,

1240
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:28,120
sit in your air conditioned apartment.
Drink your soda and like,

1241
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,290
Oh,
life is beautiful.

1242
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,660
I don't know why anybody would go out
there and kill an animal.

1243
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,950
There's a storm of animals killing
animals out there.

1244
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:39,460
It's happening right now while we're
sitting in this beautiful air

1245
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:42,160
conditioned studio here in lovely
Woodland Hills,

1246
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:46,720
California.
There is a fucking storm or coyotes or

1247
00:56:46,721 --> 00:56:51,040
kill and deer and bears are killing each
other and that fucking picture that we

1248
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:54,490
posted that you showed me,
I said I was going to post later today

1249
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:57,010
of that polar bear carrying around that
cubs head.

1250
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,480
Yeah.
Fuck man.

1251
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,530
Real life that that's going on right now
and all you're doing is a hunter.

1252
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,680
Is you're choosing to not go the factory
farm route and to make this experience

1253
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:14,050
of gathering your food a massive
challenge and an incredibly rewarding

1254
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:19,051
experience and you connect yourself to
the wild in some really bizarre way that

1255
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:24,040
I never understood until I started doing
it.

1256
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,240
Once I.
Once I started,

1257
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,760
like I always thought,
well this is probably the better way to

1258
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:28,800
get meat.
Yeah,

1259
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,210
but once I started doing it this
logically,

1260
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:32,920
you thought it made sense,
right?

1261
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,783
Exactly.
Yeah,

1262
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,790
but I had no real connection now,
but when you get that spiritual

1263
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:40,870
connection with the animals that the
country,

1264
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:45,190
the challenge,
your own human spirit and what it takes,

1265
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,240
that's where the powerful,
how,

1266
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,280
how powerful hunting is really.
It's driven home.

1267
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,503
Well,
it's just,

1268
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:53,883
it's,
it's,

1269
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:57,640
it's kind of psychedelic in a way and
people had gotten mad at me because I've

1270
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,810
said this and this is what I mean by
Psychedelic,

1271
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,490
like the.

1272
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,540
I mean even hunting an animal and
looking in his eyes.

1273
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:08,380
It's psychedelic and some sort of a
weird way because it's,

1274
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,870
it's paradigm shifting and it's,
it sort of,

1275
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:16,871
it changes your view.
It like takes you out of perspective

1276
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,760
shifting thing because when you're
actually in this animal's environment,

1277
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:26,100
you're in this really quiet forest and
you're,

1278
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,310
you're sneaking up on this animal and
you,

1279
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,340
you,
you're pursuing it and you're hunting it

1280
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,160
and you lock eyes with this thing and in
this,

1281
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,890
this animal's world,
this animal doesn't know anything about

1282
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,140
culture.
It doesn't know anything about your

1283
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:43,141
traditions or your rules or your ideas
or your ethics or what you think should

1284
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:48,370
and shouldn't be done.
This thing is just trying to survive.

1285
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,730
That's it and some very strange way
where it is.

1286
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,480
Not only is it trying to survive,
it's trying to keep other things from

1287
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:56,710
doing what it wants to do.

1288
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,050
It wants to stab these other deer with
his antlers so that they can't fuck the

1289
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:05,830
girls that it wants to fuck.
He wants to pass on its genes in some

1290
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,630
incredibly primitive competition.
Yeah.

1291
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,610
This gene competition that's going on
and some sort of a way where they're

1292
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:13,241
not,
they're not.

1293
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:16,440
They're not intellectualizing it.
Now they're not thinking about it like,

1294
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,460
well,
what I want to do is pass on my name

1295
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:22,610
because my boys are going to be the
hanes boys and their hands boys never

1296
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:23,510
quit.
No,

1297
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,820
they are not thinking like that.
They're not thinking there.

1298
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:30,470
No nobleness it.
All it is is survival and and breeding.

1299
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:35,530
It's some sort of a nature mathematics
thing that's going on and you know this,

1300
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,550
this world is this savage,
primal,

1301
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:44,570
crazy world and what you're doing as a
hunter is entering into that world.

1302
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:48,320
Now,
what people who don't have don't seem to

1303
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:53,321
understand is that the people that do
hunt are responsible directly for the

1304
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:59,420
population increase of all these animals
and it's very contradictory in a lot of

1305
00:59:59,421 --> 00:59:59,720
ways.

1306
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,340
These people,
they don't like the people that,

1307
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,310
that don't like hunting,
but love animals don't understand that

1308
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,480
the numbers are where they are now
directly because of people contributing

1309
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:15,071
to wildlife preservation to habitat
preservation and to making sure that

1310
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:19,910
wildlife biologist manage these areas
properly and that's like,

1311
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,850
that's a hard pill to swallow for people
who love animals,

1312
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:27,851
but the people who are spending the most
amount of money to keep these animals

1313
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:30,020
healthy,
want to go kill them and eat them.

1314
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,570
Yeah.
It's a,

1315
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,080
it's like many things in life.
It doesn't necessarily add up the way

1316
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:37,910
you'd like it.
It seems contradictory,

1317
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:40,380
but hunters are why there's more,
you know,

1318
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:42,050
we looked this up last time.
More deer,

1319
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:45,260
elk bear Turkey numbers than there ever
has been in North America.

1320
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:46,420
So I mean,
um,

1321
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,590
I think elk is.
Elk doesn't occupy as much area as it

1322
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:54,500
used to be,
but that was because the assholes who

1323
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:57,800
were around in the 18 hundreds who came
along first or the 16,

1324
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,210
17 and 18 hundreds.

1325
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,600
They just shot the shit out of him know.
And they were doing it for me to stay

1326
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:05,170
alive.
A lot of it was also,

1327
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,590
uh,
Dan Flores,

1328
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,460
who was on Ronell's podcast,
if you haven't listened to that and the

1329
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,830
mediator podcast,
listen to this one because it's

1330
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,830
sensational.
He's a wildlife historian and talks

1331
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:20,831
about the history of wildlife in North
America and the same guys that killed

1332
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:24,140
off massive amounts of buffalo in this
country and all of sudden almost made

1333
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:27,350
them extinct.
They did the same thing with pronghorns.

1334
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,540
They did the same thing with elk.
They just,

1335
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:34,870
these were guys who came back from the
wars and they just had no skills other

1336
01:01:35,061 --> 01:01:38,720
than killing things.
And this was a way to make money for the

1337
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:41,090
market.
So they would go out and just slaughter

1338
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:44,720
wholesale slaughter of these animals
when they ran out of Buffalo,

1339
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:48,170
they turned to the antelope and for hide
and for all these other things.

1340
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:51,110
And you know,
human beings can be this incredibly

1341
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:53,560
thoughtless consumer.
And I think that that's,

1342
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:58,650
that's that connection for.
It's unfairly connected to hunting.

1343
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,070
Yeah.
And some sort of a way.

1344
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,180
Well now.
And that's,

1345
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:02,900
you know,
Hunter's,

1346
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,810
nowadays I think we're doing a good job
at driving home.

1347
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:07,940
The point hunting is conservation,
you know,

1348
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,800
rocky mountain now [inaudible] has
helped,

1349
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,920
uh,
they coined that term and it's true,

1350
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,320
you know,
hunters are out there doing,

1351
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,090
doing the work,
paying the money.

1352
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,183
Um,
yeah,

1353
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,790
we're killing animals,
but it's to the benefit of the animals.

1354
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:21,460
Also,
Ben.

1355
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,340
Oh,
Brian has an interesting take on that.

1356
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,260
Uh,
our friend Benno Brian who used to work

1357
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:28,440
at Peterson's and now I'm worse at Yeti
coolers.

1358
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,330
He says conservation is something that
comes along.

1359
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,920
It's a byproduct of it.
But really it's about hunting.

1360
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,050
Yeah.
And I think that's,

1361
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,830
that's the honest answer.

1362
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,693
Oh No,
I'm.

1363
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:45,030
When I'm out there hunting,
I'm not thinking I needed to be the best

1364
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:46,120
conservationists.
I can't.

1365
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,043
I mean,
no,

1366
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,880
I'm out there to be successful.
But that mantra,

1367
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:53,490
it gets kind of,
it's an argument mantra.

1368
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,300
It's like people that are hunting are
dealing with so much pressure from

1369
01:02:57,301 --> 01:02:59,340
people that are angry about hunting.
Right.

1370
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,230
That and then this is a different world
too,

1371
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:05,640
because you were saying when you grew up
that hunters were thought of as like,

1372
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:07,500
wow,
this guy provides for his family.

1373
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:09,540
He goes out and does this incredibly
difficult thing.

1374
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:12,450
It's very noble hunters were looked at
with respect.

1375
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,580
I mean,
you looked up to a hunter,

1376
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:15,803
you're like,
you know,

1377
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,880
if somebody was successful,
did you get your elk this year?

1378
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,080
Yeah.
Oh Man.

1379
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,210
You know that guy.
He's a stud.

1380
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,830
It's tough to do.
Tough to do.

1381
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:23,650
Went out and did it.

1382
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:27,690
So hunters were put on a pedestal when I
grew up in the town I grew up and where

1383
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:29,880
I lived and it was.
There was something,

1384
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,860
you know,
you had pride that you hunted.

1385
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,720
Well,
this is what I think is good about all

1386
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:36,990
this controversy that when you were
doing this,

1387
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:40,710
when you were young,
there was no social media and so you

1388
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:45,180
weren't engaging with people that
thought in a contrary way that thought

1389
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:47,940
different,
that we're upset by your actions and

1390
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:50,040
they weren't engaging with you either.
Right?

1391
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,820
They looked at hunters like elmer Fudd,
you know,

1392
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:56,850
they looked at him like some guy hunters
in a movie or always this drunk guy was

1393
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,730
out there shooting at anything that
moved.

1394
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,210
Bad Guy,
the bad guy,

1395
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,073
oh,
he's a bad guy,

1396
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,380
and that was their perception and your
perception was based on your environment

1397
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:10,920
where you're in an area that's pretty,
pretty rural,

1398
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,380
a lot of wildlife,
a lot of hunters,

1399
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:16,260
and it's a super normal part of the
environment,

1400
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:17,094
the culture.

1401
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:21,810
So these people that are urban,
that are just conditioned to thinking of

1402
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:26,520
animals as being pet that you love and
food is being something that gets you

1403
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:29,700
get from a grocery store.
Even the people that buy meat,

1404
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,820
they're not involved in any way,
shape or form in the killing of that

1405
01:04:32,821 --> 01:04:34,710
meat.
So they're completely disconnected from

1406
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:35,610
it.
So this,

1407
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:39,450
even though there's like this craziness
going on where these animal rights

1408
01:04:39,451 --> 01:04:42,300
people are saying,
I hope your mother gets raped and killed

1409
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:45,780
and murdered and gutted in front of your
children and all this crazy shit that

1410
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:49,560
I've seen these angry,
angry people that think of.

1411
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,350
Well,
I don't know if there's a lot going on.

1412
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:57,530
I don't know if they're actually angry
in as much that made it into like a

1413
01:04:57,601 --> 01:05:02,601
logical progression where it makes sense
or if it's just they feel like they have

1414
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:07,500
the right to go after you because you're
killing things and they're really just

1415
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,760
fucking imbalanced.

1416
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,290
There's a lot of that and there's a lot
of imbalanced people that do really good

1417
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:18,291
things because it allows them to be
really aggressive in their negative.

1418
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,150
They're negative behavior.
Like there's some people that love to be

1419
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:26,860
negative and they love to be aggressive
and they love to be shitty and insulting

1420
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:31,861
and and hostile and the way to ensure
that that behavior is not just accepted

1421
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:37,651
but actually rewarded is to be negative
and hostile and even violent for a good

1422
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:39,160
cause.
Yeah.

1423
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,620
Yeah,
and so they're masking their really

1424
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:43,850
psychotic,
fucked up behavior.

1425
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,520
It looks.
One of the things like people's like

1426
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,040
being a,
being an animal rights person or being a

1427
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:51,820
Vegan is about compassion.
Except when you're talking to people

1428
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,720
that don't agree with you and then
you're allowed to get fucking super

1429
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:59,200
hostile and super negative and violent
and self righteous.

1430
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:03,340
Call us murderers and say we deserve to
die and they would like to kill us.

1431
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:06,880
So they're tolerant until you know
there's a cause.

1432
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:11,970
A cause that you know is you have to
actually think to justify and you have

1433
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,240
to actually look at the big picture,
you know,

1434
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,820
but when it's easy and say,
Oh,

1435
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,560
you hunt,
you're a murderer,

1436
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:18,940
right?
I wish you were dead.

1437
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,440
That's easy.
Yeah.

1438
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:20,860
Well,
it's,

1439
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,690
it's in it.
I understand it,

1440
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,660
I understand it.
I understand where they're coming from

1441
01:06:25,661 --> 01:06:28,300
and I understand their perspective of
someone who actually does love animals.

1442
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:32,110
I understand that this contradiction is
very difficult to deal with and that's

1443
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:36,460
one of the things that I think is
important about this new age of

1444
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:39,970
interaction is that some people are kind
of getting the understanding.

1445
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:41,320
They're getting the message like,
okay,

1446
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,490
I thought that this thing was about
these people that hated animals that

1447
01:06:45,491 --> 01:06:50,140
went out and shot him and killed him.
But now I'm seeing that this thing also

1448
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:54,850
has a lot of different layers to it and
there's a broad range of these people

1449
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:00,360
and the noble ones are actually doing
not just a service to the wildlife.

1450
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,840
They're stewards of the wildlife and
stewards of the land and there are also

1451
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,720
up there getting their food.
They're getting the healthiest food that

1452
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:15,721
a person can eat right from the wild and
that this idea that you can somehow or

1453
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:21,400
another have no harm and do no harm to
animals.

1454
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,860
Well that's not true.
You can't do no harm.

1455
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:24,461
And we said,
well,

1456
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:27,430
you could do less harm.
Depends on what you think less harm

1457
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:30,040
means.
Because if you're talking about bugs,

1458
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:33,070
are bugs life.
If you're talking about rodents,

1459
01:07:33,071 --> 01:07:35,140
if you're talking about things that get
chewed up when they,

1460
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,190
when they processed grain,
right,

1461
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,460
you're not.
Animals are dying and if you,

1462
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,260
and if you procreate,
boy,

1463
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,710
that's a fucking ball of wax right
there.

1464
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:46,510
That's a bag of worms or whatever it is.
What is the expression?

1465
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,990
Bag of worms.
It was a bag of wax.

1466
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,340
I can wax.
If you procreate,

1467
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:56,520
boy your your you,
you are creating a beautiful little baby

1468
01:07:56,830 --> 01:08:01,780
human being that is going to consume and
it's gonna Cause waste.

1469
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:05,560
It's going to burn fossil fuels into the
atmosphere.

1470
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,360
It's going to promote global warming.
It's going to have plastic that most

1471
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:13,600
likely will wash up into the ocean.
It's going to be a consumer of all these

1472
01:08:13,601 --> 01:08:18,601
things and there's no way around that.
So if you love people like I do,

1473
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:22,910
I've hugged and love people.
People are destroyers.

1474
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,380
Yeah.
Dislike.

1475
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,660
You know,
just like bears eat cubs.

1476
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:29,300
People make a certain amount of waste.
Yeah,

1477
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,410
and hopefully we can figure out a way to
balance that out as people get more and

1478
01:08:33,411 --> 01:08:38,411
more complex in their ability to utilize
recycled materials and maybe even

1479
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:42,830
possibly turn some of the waste that we
pump out into the air.

1480
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,690
There was discussion about that,
about extracting pollution from the air

1481
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:51,110
and using it as fuel and there'd be some
way to do that.

1482
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:52,580
I don't.
I know that scientists are actually

1483
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:57,410
trying to come up with feasible methods
of taking places that are just like

1484
01:08:57,411 --> 01:09:02,200
really polluted and actually using that
pollutants are those pollutants and

1485
01:09:02,201 --> 01:09:04,640
turning it into some sort of a product
that we can use.

1486
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,660
They're smarter than me.
I know that me too,

1487
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,290
but I'm,
I'm,

1488
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,860
I'm help.
I'm hopeful.

1489
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,920
But what I'm saying is that we're all in
some way responsible for some sort of an

1490
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:21,791
impact on the world that we live in and
just like dog shit on the ground and you

1491
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:24,920
know,
cats kill every fucking thing they get a

1492
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:26,510
chance to.
That's their design.

1493
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:27,650
That's what they're supposed to do.

1494
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,920
There's nothing more friendly to a
hunter.

1495
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:31,200
I can tell you that,
you know,

1496
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,960
if you're talking about,
um,

1497
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,350
helping the environment,
getting out there,

1498
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:39,630
killing yourself,
processing it,

1499
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,050
bringing it home,
that's,

1500
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,230
you know,
that's about as good as it gets as far

1501
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:45,850
as ECO friendly.
And,

1502
01:09:45,851 --> 01:09:46,640
uh,
I think,

1503
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,290
I think we're getting that message out
there on the positive attributes of

1504
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:49,901
hunting.
I mean,

1505
01:09:49,901 --> 01:09:51,610
we've talked about this a number of
times.

1506
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,800
You've talked about it with other guests
number times,

1507
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,821
and I see,
yeah,

1508
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:57,370
I still see a lot of hate,
anger,

1509
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:00,730
misunder not misunderstanding,
but they don't want to understand.

1510
01:10:00,731 --> 01:10:05,110
It doesn't feel like.
But on the other side I get messages

1511
01:10:05,111 --> 01:10:09,040
from a lot of people who are saying,
I've never thought about hunting now way

1512
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:13,210
I'm interested in providing for myself.
I wanted to be self sufficient.

1513
01:10:13,211 --> 01:10:14,950
I'm trying,
I'm getting a bow.

1514
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:16,090
So I mean,
you know,

1515
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:18,660
we're doing good things also.
I mean I know we,

1516
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,130
we talk about the negative lot and we
focus on that.

1517
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:21,964
I mean,
you know,

1518
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:25,690
if you look at it,
if you look at my social media stuff,

1519
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,760
I do notice the negatives.
I'm probably too much so I mean I know

1520
01:10:30,761 --> 01:10:32,080
we talk about that,
but man,

1521
01:10:32,081 --> 01:10:33,610
there's a lot of positive out there too,

1522
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,920
is way more positive than there is
negative now,

1523
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:40,240
but it's all in what you focus on.
If you decided to focus on the negative,

1524
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:41,480
there'd be way more negative.
Yeah,

1525
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,210
I mean you can definitely find it.
Yeah.

1526
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,900
Just put Hashtag Vegan on all your posts
and watch what happens.

1527
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,350
That's what you do.
I only did it once.

1528
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,240
Oh my God,
I get so upset.

1529
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:53,980
And it was,
it was over a joke.

1530
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,270
It was a joke,
but it was,

1531
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,290
it had meat in it.
Can't handle jokes now.

1532
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,270
But I think that,
um,

1533
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,860
just these conversations,
they're,

1534
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,850
they're important.
It's also important for people that are

1535
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:11,050
there.
They're in chanted by maybe a more

1536
01:11:11,051 --> 01:11:15,930
radical,
a animal activist perspective and you

1537
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:17,100
know,
it seems to make sense,

1538
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,140
but sometimes the that needs to be
balanced out and you need to consider

1539
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:25,890
both sides.
And I think the hunting side is not

1540
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:28,470
represented enough in an intelligent
way.

1541
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:31,740
We're,
it balances out some of the more radical

1542
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:36,741
and also proselytizing like they're
trying to convert people into their

1543
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:40,530
world in a lot of ways.
Like a lot of people that are animal

1544
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:43,260
rights people were Vegan.
People are really actively trying to get

1545
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:47,970
people to do what they do and get super
upset when people find it unhealthy or

1546
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,450
no longer do it.
Yeah.

1547
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:54,790
It meanwhile,
95 percent of the world consumes meat 95

1548
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:57,450
percent.
But when people go back and that used to

1549
01:11:57,451 --> 01:11:58,920
be Vegan and they say,
I just fucking,

1550
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:00,720
my whole body's falling apart,
my hair's falling out,

1551
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:02,640
my skin is to dry,
have no energy,

1552
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,770
and this is a really common.
People say,

1553
01:12:04,771 --> 01:12:05,700
well,
it's because you're doing it wrong.

1554
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,720
Not necessarily.
There's a lot of aspects like you.

1555
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,350
I'm not saying you should or shouldn't
do it,

1556
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:14,310
but there's a lot of aspects that if you
talk to an actual scientist,

1557
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,300
real nutritionist,
people who are experts in human biology

1558
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:22,200
and the direct mechanisms of absorbing
nutrients,

1559
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:25,710
there's some real issues with plant
versions of many different things

1560
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:29,580
including vitamin B.
Twelve have a bunch of different fatty

1561
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:34,110
acids that although they are active in
some plants and seeds and oils which are

1562
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:37,430
probably good for you,
they're actually not nearly as bio

1563
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:40,980
available as fatty fish and you know,
Dah Da.

1564
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,960
And a lot of,
um,

1565
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,640
a lot of different essential fatty
acids,

1566
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:46,770
Omega threes and sixes and all these
different things.

1567
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:51,000
They're more,
more biologically available to human

1568
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:54,360
beings in animal form.
And this is just science.

1569
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,550
This is getting a forget about the idea
that you shouldn't do it because what's

1570
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,200
talk about like what is good for the
human body itself,

1571
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:04,530
but it's,
it's fucking hard to get the same stuff

1572
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:07,320
from plants and if it's important to you
and you want to do it,

1573
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:08,460
you can do,
you can.

1574
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,380
But my driver yesterday,
um,

1575
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,220
he,
he switched into was a Vegan.

1576
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,780
He's a Vegan now and um,
so he was telling me that actually since

1577
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:23,781
he started with his veganism,
he eats way less healthy because while

1578
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:28,580
he's not eating meat,
he's eating potato chips and he's eating

1579
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,220
all these carbs and all of these empty
carbs and there's just like,

1580
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:33,870
yeah,
so I'm not eating me,

1581
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:37,800
but man,
I feel terrible and I'm eating awful

1582
01:13:37,801 --> 01:13:38,670
Doritos.

1583
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:42,720
There's no meat and Doritos but not that
great for you as well.

1584
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:45,600
Sam Harris,
who was on our podcast recently,

1585
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:50,630
he recently can be converted to being a
Vegan as well because of the honest

1586
01:13:50,821 --> 01:13:53,820
concerns with factory farming and things
along those lines.

1587
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,310
And uh,
his blood lip,

1588
01:13:55,311 --> 01:13:56,700
it's,
we're all fucked up and he's like,

1589
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:58,740
I gotta figure this out because you
know,

1590
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,900
you're eating carbs all the time.
Your body just,

1591
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,780
your insulin spikes,
your blood sugar level spikes.

1592
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,670
It's just not necessarily healthy unless
you,

1593
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:10,830
you have to approach it the right way.
You got to eat a lot of like healthy

1594
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:14,230
things like almond butters,
really important nuts,

1595
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:15,610
macadamia nuts,
you gotta,

1596
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:20,260
you gotta find a way to get oils and
fats from your foods.

1597
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:23,110
And also the way that affects brain
function,

1598
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:25,180
it gets,
it's really important that you have a

1599
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:29,350
certain amount of Omega is to really to
have your fucking brain conduct

1600
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:30,160
properly.

1601
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,560
It's like having good spark plugs in
your fucking car.

1602
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,200
Well,
I ate a lot of meat and I feel pretty

1603
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:38,050
healthy.
But it's,

1604
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,750
it's also,
there's a debate where,

1605
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:41,261
you know,
you say,

1606
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:43,900
well,
someone who is a Vegan does less harm.

1607
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:49,090
And that there's definitely an argument
for that.

1608
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:53,740
If you accept a hierarchy of life.
And this is where it gets tricky because

1609
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:58,030
what they're saying is that you should
not think that a human beings life is

1610
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:01,270
more important that an animal's life
because that's speciesism.

1611
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:02,590
Right.
Have you heard that?

1612
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,640
This is new.
I said,

1613
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,030
well,
I saw a Kat von d put up a little thing

1614
01:15:07,031 --> 01:15:12,031
on her instagram and it had,
it had like a man at the top of the food

1615
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:18,310
chain basically.
And that was labeled as ego and then it

1616
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:21,740
had man mixed in with all the other
animals and that was ego.

1617
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:23,680
That's interesting.
Well,

1618
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:27,040
ECO is man mixed in with all the other
animals if you eat them,

1619
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,100
if you consume them the way they consume
each other.

1620
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:33,550
I like,
I'm not saying it's egotistical,

1621
01:15:33,551 --> 01:15:35,530
but I'm saying man is a top of the food
chain.

1622
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,100
Well yeah.
Duh.

1623
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:39,370
And I don't have,
I don't,

1624
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,890
I'm not hiding that fact.
I don't feel bad about that.

1625
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,790
Now I'm a big fan of people,
but also a Kat von d needs to consider.

1626
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:50,791
And I love cat.
Her tattoos are most likely not Vegan

1627
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:52,730
inc is made with animal products.
Yeah.

1628
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:53,231
Yeah.
I mean,

1629
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:57,520
that's a part of tattoo ink and they do
have some Vegan inks now,

1630
01:15:57,521 --> 01:16:01,330
but um,
the idea that all those tattoos that she

1631
01:16:01,331 --> 01:16:04,290
has are all Vegan dot.
Alright.

1632
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,710
Yeah.
That sounds rough.

1633
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:08,080
What's better?
It was Vegan Inc is good.

1634
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,270
Wonder if it's a one or if it's less
good.

1635
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,680
I don't know if it's like Vegan chicken.
Let me,

1636
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,200
I'm going to start protocols.
Taste.

1637
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,130
Yeah.
Um,

1638
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,630
but my point is the accepting the
hierarchy of life.

1639
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:24,631
Because if you buy commercial grain,
you're directly responsible for an

1640
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:29,851
industry that kills a lot of beings now
are the pesticides.

1641
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:33,910
Unless you buy everything organic from
fucking handpick farm when you

1642
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:38,740
absolutely know that no one had any,
absolutely no pesticides were done,

1643
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:42,190
no one had anything that they put into
the ground that's dangerous to any of

1644
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:44,740
the life that's not likely.
Now,

1645
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:49,770
keep the likely case is that if you're
buying pasta or if you're buying rice or

1646
01:16:50,081 --> 01:16:54,280
if you're buying any of these things,
you're buying these things from some

1647
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:58,420
sort of a farm that displaces wildlife,
kills,

1648
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:02,140
massive amounts of rodents and bugs and
all these different things in.

1649
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:06,370
Is a bug worth as much as the life of
NLC.

1650
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,160
We need to make this discussion.
This is an important.

1651
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,510
Is a mouse as worth as much as a white
tail deer,

1652
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,010
right?
I don't know if it is,

1653
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:21,100
but I know that millions of rodents are
killed in this country every year with

1654
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,990
green combines and with that
illustration where all the animals are

1655
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,140
mixed in with the man.
I guess everybody's equal,

1656
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:30,140
right?
So why would it be okay to have wheat

1657
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:33,080
harvested?
Buzzards flying all around that field

1658
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:36,140
because of all the carnage down below
and they're scavengers,

1659
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:39,470
so all the the road and saw the,
the rabbits,

1660
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:43,130
all the pheasants,
even white tail fawn,

1661
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:45,980
maybe all the animals that are killed
and they're.

1662
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,950
They're coming down to eat those.
So in the harvest of that wheat bread

1663
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,640
for that week or the week for the bread,
all of these animals died.

1664
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,290
Well,
if everything's equal,

1665
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,220
why is that okay?

1666
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,670
But hunting isn't,
it doesn't make any sense.

1667
01:17:58,671 --> 01:17:59,540
No,
but it's,

1668
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:04,590
it's a convenient way of looking at
things and it's also like bug spray.

1669
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,910
I used to live near an Ashram in boulder
and uh,

1670
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:11,590
the fucking lady who ran the restaurant
was poisoning nance.

1671
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:13,123
And I go,
Hey,

1672
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,580
what'd you do when she was using ant
poison?

1673
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,331
She's like,
well,

1674
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:19,700
we do what we have to.
Sometimes when we have ants would go,

1675
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,930
you're not supposed to.
You're a vegetarian.

1676
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:27,980
She's a Vegan and you don't believe in
killing life unless these conti bugs at

1677
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:33,280
that tried to invade your camp and then
you kill them in mass with toxic

1678
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:37,010
chemicals.
You spray from the sky in these

1679
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,030
canisters of death.
I mean,

1680
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:45,070
what a weird sort of a game you're
playing in your head about life and

1681
01:18:45,411 --> 01:18:50,411
death is an insect's life worth less
than a mammal's life.

1682
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:51,560
Well,
why is that?

1683
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,260
Well,
because an insect is not as much aware.

1684
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,690
You ever tried to Swat a fly?
Yeah,

1685
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,260
there's a reason why they get the fuck
out of the way.

1686
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:58,460
They don't want to die.
They know.

1687
01:18:58,461 --> 01:18:59,300
Okay.
So,

1688
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:03,020
but is an insect's life worth less than
a mouse?

1689
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,850
Some people would say yes.
Okay.

1690
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,200
Why is that?
Well,

1691
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:08,660
a mouse is a had as emotions and see.
Okay,

1692
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:09,710
okay.
Alright,

1693
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:13,190
well then we're accepting a hierarchy.
Well,

1694
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:15,470
these animals that can't communicate,
they're not as good as people.

1695
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,210
Okay,
so we're going to eat them because it

1696
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,590
makes you healthier.
That's,

1697
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,630
I mean,
is that we accept in this.

1698
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:21,260
No,
we're not.

1699
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,150
Well then you got to stop eating grain
man,

1700
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,230
because you're,
you're,

1701
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:26,840
you're a part of wholesale slaughter.
You have to.

1702
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,000
Well,
I think it goes back to,

1703
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,980
uh,
there's a lot of hypocritical people

1704
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,930
there,
but they're prostitize.

1705
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:35,630
This is where it gets really weird.
I was watching this guy give this

1706
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:39,260
argument about how human beings are not
designed to eat meat.

1707
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:43,160
That's why we can't kill an animal with
our hands and our teeth and we have to

1708
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:46,370
cook it in order to process it.
That's the only way our body consumes

1709
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:47,480
it.
Well,

1710
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:48,650
guess what?
Fuck face.

1711
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,440
Try eating wheat.
Yeah,

1712
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,700
try pulling rice out of the ground and
eating that.

1713
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:54,270
We process everything,
man.

1714
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,720
We process.
We process rice,

1715
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:01,310
we process many grains and beans.
We process a lot of shit because we're

1716
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:04,310
smart.
We figured out how to use tools a long

1717
01:20:04,311 --> 01:20:05,121
time ago.
Yeah,

1718
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:08,310
we figured out how to burn things.
It makes it compatible and your body

1719
01:20:08,311 --> 01:20:11,100
adjusted to the fact that you were
cooking off the bacteria and these

1720
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:13,410
things all the time.
Your gut flora changes.

1721
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,420
There's a whole process going on,
man.

1722
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:20,040
There's a whole evolutionary process
involving tools and fire and that's why

1723
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:23,340
we have cities and that's why you have a
fucking youtube account where you can

1724
01:20:23,341 --> 01:20:25,080
make these ridiculous claims in the
first place.

1725
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:29,400
It's all designed by people overcoming
the wild environment because I don't

1726
01:20:29,401 --> 01:20:31,350
know if you checked,
but we're fleshy.

1727
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:34,530
Little water balloons of blood.
That's what we are.

1728
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:36,210
We're.
We're really vulnerable.

1729
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:40,500
Without all these tools and all these
houses and all these fucking people that

1730
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:44,370
figured out fire and metal and all this
shit long before you were alive.

1731
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,600
The reason why you're alive today is
because really ingenious,

1732
01:20:48,601 --> 01:20:51,750
inventive,
industrious people figured out how to

1733
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:56,751
survive in a world where we could shit.
We're weak and vulnerable and the

1734
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:00,660
animals come in and just her jack and
things left and right,

1735
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:03,000
and we're out there with their little
baby in this world.

1736
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:04,740
Did you hear about the fucking 15 year
old kid?

1737
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:08,670
They get pulled out of a fucking tent by
a Hyena by his face.

1738
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:12,420
He got yanked out of a fucking 10 by his
face.

1739
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,310
Oh,
we're going to go on a happy camping

1740
01:21:14,311 --> 01:21:17,340
trip.
This kid is just hanging out in the

1741
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:20,550
natural world.
I love animals because they love you

1742
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:21,450
too.
You Fuck?

1743
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,000
They love to eat.
You look at this boy.

1744
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:27,900
15 had his face chewed by a Hyena as he
slept in a tent next to it.

1745
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:31,450
Carrots in the Kruger National Park.
Yeah.

1746
01:21:31,451 --> 01:21:34,030
That's.
That's the real deal that his bones were

1747
01:21:34,031 --> 01:21:36,640
crushed.
Like a packet of crisps.

1748
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,890
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1749
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,230
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1750
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:46,270
Hyenas are brutal.
Teen was conscious throughout the attack

1751
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:50,220
and now undergoing surgery.
Oh Huh.

1752
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:55,430
Only saved when his uncle heard him
being dragged like a blanket Hyena was

1753
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:58,630
looking for food had been seen in the
week before.

1754
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:01,950
The attack.
If you've ever seen a Hyena hose,

1755
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,450
things are.
I mean they're killers.

1756
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,250
Yeah.
Well that's why they're there.

1757
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,740
That's why they're there.
Nature has this very efficient system.

1758
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:12,400
All they do is kill and they don't care
what it is they're killing it.

1759
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,940
Well,
Africa in particular is so fascinating

1760
01:22:15,941 --> 01:22:17,890
to me.
I was going to go on vacation there with

1761
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:19,840
my family this year,
but I found out we'd have to get a bunch

1762
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:21,700
of shots.
You went to Tanzania,

1763
01:22:21,701 --> 01:22:22,840
did you get a bunch of shots?

1764
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:28,720
I'm not giving my six year olds some
crazy shots so they can endure Zika,

1765
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:32,140
that Orient Malaria.
That's a big one.

1766
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,600
How much did you have to.
What kind of shots did you have to get?

1767
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,450
I don't know.
I got like I think four different shots,

1768
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,290
but you know,
when I was in camp there,

1769
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:43,870
there was uh,
one of the workers there had malaria.

1770
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:47,080
It's not what you want to get.
And what was the,

1771
01:22:47,081 --> 01:22:50,170
what was it like a,
he's just weak and you know,

1772
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:54,160
sick and given him antibiotics,
I don't know what they're doing.

1773
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,700
Yeah.
I wonder if they even have antibiotics

1774
01:22:57,701 --> 01:22:58,690
and a lot of places.
Right?

1775
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:01,450
I don't know.
I mean it's a lot different than here,

1776
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,330
but it's a,
it's a brutal place.

1777
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:05,223
Well,
life is

1778
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:09,820
in this weird cycle.
We are so soft here.

1779
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,240
I mean,
I just think we're getting weaker and

1780
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:14,660
weaker.
Um,

1781
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,420
but yeah,
over there,

1782
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:19,150
if you're a week,
you're gone.

1783
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,770
Well,
everywhere where it's hard.

1784
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,480
When,
when things get rough,

1785
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,810
when things are not rough,
that's when people can relax.

1786
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:27,610
And that's one of the beautiful things
about cities.

1787
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:31,810
We figured out a way to put up these
concrete structures that nothing can get

1788
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:32,471
in.
No,

1789
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:34,420
no wild things can get in and you can
take a break,

1790
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,340
relax and eat chips,
get fat.

1791
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,860
But I hate it here.
I like it.

1792
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:42,850
I like it in the mountains where I am
vulnerable,

1793
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,190
where,
you know,

1794
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,590
hopefully my training and my experience
and whatever keeps me alive.

1795
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:53,220
But also there's a weird sort of
electric feeling to that world,

1796
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,660
this like a,
I want to say electric,

1797
01:23:55,661 --> 01:24:00,661
but it's stimulating feeling to that
world when you're walking around in that

1798
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:05,110
world and you're acutely aware that you
are now part of this system and that you

1799
01:24:05,111 --> 01:24:07,780
could turn the wrong corner,
run into a fucking grizzly bear.

1800
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,480
You could turn the wrong corner and run
into a mountain lion.

1801
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:12,910
It doesn't happen a lot,
but it could happen.

1802
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,470
You could fall,
you know,

1803
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,600
like your friend Roy.
So it's,

1804
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:17,590
uh,
yeah,

1805
01:24:17,591 --> 01:24:18,610
I mean,
that's where,

1806
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:21,730
I mean,
that's where I feel most alive

1807
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,200
obviously,
because you have to be,

1808
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,060
you know,
if you're not in tune,

1809
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:28,480
um,
who knows what happens.

1810
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:33,870
It seems like also that there's some,
some reward systems that are built into

1811
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:38,650
being a human being.
They get like little switches that gets

1812
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:41,250
snapped on when you're out there that
you didn't,

1813
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:46,500
I didn't even know existed.
And it's what I've seen with many people

1814
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,130
who are very smart people who become
hunters,

1815
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:53,890
who then they start talking about it.
They articulate really similar thoughts

1816
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,190
that it becomes a,
the the,

1817
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:02,540
the act of consuming becomes very
different when you acquire it the hard

1818
01:25:02,981 --> 01:25:03,250
way.

1819
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,930
Yeah,
same as.

1820
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,930
There's a feeling that you get is a much
more muted version of it,

1821
01:25:07,931 --> 01:25:11,650
but it's a really good feeling that you
get when you grow a salad and you're

1822
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:13,910
eating that salad grew in your own yard.
Yeah,

1823
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:16,840
but that's a much more muted.
It's a,

1824
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:18,880
it's a beautiful feeling.
It feels nice.

1825
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:21,280
It feels satisfying,
but it's much more muted.

1826
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:23,700
Like when I cook an elk steak.
Yeah.

1827
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,190
That's something that I,
I,

1828
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:28,180
I was there for the entire time,
you know,

1829
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,180
when it got shot,
helped cut it up and carry it out.

1830
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:32,143
Yeah.
There's a,

1831
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:37,410
there's a memory attached to that.
There's a primal satisfaction attached

1832
01:25:37,631 --> 01:25:39,820
to that and there's also this feeling
like,

1833
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,720
I know that thing wasn't penned up.
I know that thing didn't get stuffed

1834
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:46,660
full of hormones.
I know that thing didn't get tortured

1835
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:51,040
before it died.
I know it wasn't corralled into this

1836
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:54,040
area and then they shoot a fucking
piston into its brain while it's

1837
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:54,640
watching.

1838
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,180
All of his friends die in the same way.
Yeah,

1839
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,310
I know it.
I don't know if they know.

1840
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:01,720
I don't know if they have friends
though.

1841
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:05,480
Debt buddies to hang out.
They have a pit in the pin.

1842
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,930
They hang out until,
until pussies out like many other

1843
01:26:08,931 --> 01:26:11,000
friends.
Then the backstabbing begins.

1844
01:26:11,001 --> 01:26:13,730
Literally.
They stab each other in the back with

1845
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:16,730
their antlers.
It's brutal out there.

1846
01:26:16,731 --> 01:26:17,564
But yeah,
I mean I,

1847
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:21,920
that connection a hunter has with it
with the animal and,

1848
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:27,340
and just be able to bring that home and
cook it up and sit around the table.

1849
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,480
That's just with your family.
I mean,

1850
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:32,570
that's how it's always been.
That's how it's always been since the

1851
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:36,260
beginning of time.
Being a provider is a powerful thing and

1852
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:39,110
I wonder if this new trend away from
the.

1853
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,200
I wonder what's going on with human
beings and uh,

1854
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:46,700
if it is just a natural progression of
creating structures and safety and

1855
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,970
society in the sense of civilization,
the way we think of it today,

1856
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:55,160
I wonder if it's a natural sort of
progression to slowly but surely move

1857
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:58,610
away from that world,
that wild world,

1858
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:03,290
and to get more and more accustomed with
the idea of us creating our own food

1859
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:07,610
from some other way,
like by detaching from how you grow your

1860
01:27:07,611 --> 01:27:09,890
vegetables,
by detaching from where your meat comes

1861
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,980
from,
that were like setting ourselves up to

1862
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:17,300
go further and further down this road of
not really being an animal anymore.

1863
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:21,140
Being some new kind of weird thing.
I'm not going that way.

1864
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:22,150
You're not going,
well,

1865
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,220
you're not going that way,
this,

1866
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:24,470
this,
this life.

1867
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,890
Now in this life,
you're,

1868
01:27:25,891 --> 01:27:28,550
you're in this sort of a transitionary
stage.

1869
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:31,070
Or the culture is our society as a
demon.

1870
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:32,900
Ends are.
You're digging and digging in as a,

1871
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,600
as a hunter.
You're going old school staying old

1872
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:38,210
school,
but it me as a person who like halfassed

1873
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:41,330
scientist who tries to study human
beings trying to figure out what the

1874
01:27:41,331 --> 01:27:43,100
fuck I'm doing.
I wouldn't even use the word scientists

1875
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:44,720
loosely,
something else,

1876
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,910
whatever I am,
but when I look at it,

1877
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:49,070
I'm always like,
what is going on here?

1878
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:54,460
Because there's clearly something going
on with human beings as an organism.

1879
01:27:56,050 --> 01:28:00,230
Like there's something going on where
we're moving away from the natural world

1880
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:02,960
with cities.
We're moving away from the natural world

1881
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:05,150
with our ability to control our
environment.

1882
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:09,290
It's hot as fuck outside right now and
you and I feel great.

1883
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:10,160
How are you feeling,
jamie?

1884
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:10,994
Field?
Great.

1885
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,230
Ace is nice,
right?

1886
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:15,470
It's beautiful.
So we figured out a way to live in these

1887
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:19,880
harsh environments with no consequences
whatsoever except on in the environment

1888
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:21,460
itself.
It's consequences about the.

1889
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:26,240
But there's also this detachment from
the concerns of the world and it's one

1890
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:30,440
of the things that I've always said
about La is that La is one of the most

1891
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:34,970
unnatural places in the world because
not just because everyone's full of shit

1892
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:37,250
because they're trying to get you to
think there's something they're not.

1893
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:41,510
So you put them in a TV show or a movie,
but also because it doesn't rain here.

1894
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,160
Yeah,
it's always perfect.

1895
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:47,930
You could sleep outside and you're fine.
There's not that much wildlife worry

1896
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:49,520
about.
There's so many mountain lions,

1897
01:28:49,521 --> 01:28:51,500
they killed all the deer.
You don't even get in car accidents

1898
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:54,350
against deere.
Like our connection to wildlife is like

1899
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:56,060
fucking nil.
Yeah.

1900
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:58,970
I,
I don't think being comfortable all the

1901
01:28:58,971 --> 01:28:59,870
time.
I don't think,

1902
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,070
you know,
La and cities

1903
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,880
like La.
I don't,

1904
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,340
it's not good.
I mean it's not good to,

1905
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,720
to uh,
eliminate all the challenges of being a

1906
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:10,770
human.
I mean,

1907
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:13,590
that's why.
That's why I like getting out there and

1908
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,430
just being immersed in challenge because
I don't know.

1909
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:19,680
I mean,
how do you appreciate how good you have

1910
01:29:19,681 --> 01:29:22,470
a when you never have it hard?
That is a big point.

1911
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,600
That's a big point.
It's a big point.

1912
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,080
That was hammered home for me when I
came back from Prince of Wales.

1913
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,880
From unsuccessful hunt.
Yeah.

1914
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:32,250
We're out there for five or six days I
think,

1915
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:36,150
and it was pouring rain every day.
It was cold as shit.

1916
01:29:36,151 --> 01:29:39,300
Every day your fingers are pruned up and
you're freezing your dick off and you

1917
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:43,410
just can't wait to get back home and
when I got back home to La,

1918
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,970
my God,
it was glorious.

1919
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,920
I called up or now I go,
dude,

1920
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,450
I don't think I've ever been happier in
my life.

1921
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,090
Everyday was like so nice.
I.

1922
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:54,750
It felt so good,
like it was so nice to see my friends.

1923
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:59,340
It was so nice to to see the sun.
I called up Callan and he said the same

1924
01:29:59,341 --> 01:30:00,420
thing.
He's like,

1925
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:01,980
dude,
I feel great.

1926
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:07,350
I just feel so thankful to be back.
I feel so thankful to be in a city where

1927
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:09,040
I don't have to worry about where my
food comes from.

1928
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:10,560
We don't have to worry about starving to
death.

1929
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:14,400
Yeah.
It makes you appreciate this weird thing

1930
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:18,090
that we've gotten and I think when you
don't experience both things,

1931
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,680
that's when you take it for granted.
Yeah.

1932
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:21,390
Yeah.
So if you never would have went,

1933
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,970
you never even had those feelings.
You know,

1934
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,200
and I,
I think it's important.

1935
01:30:25,201 --> 01:30:30,201
I think it's an that's why I like when
people want to take on the challenge of

1936
01:30:30,661 --> 01:30:32,370
hunting,
want to learn more about it.

1937
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:35,190
Um,
the byproduct yet we've talked about the

1938
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,150
positive byproduct is you're
conservation is another byproduct is

1939
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:42,310
you're going to realize what,
what it's like to be uncomfortable and

1940
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:43,144
then,
you know,

1941
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,870
conversely you're going to realize how
good we have it and um,

1942
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:50,900
how you appreciate being able to walk up
to the tap and fill up a glass of water.

1943
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:54,330
I mean,
I've been on a lot of haunts were just

1944
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:56,520
getting water was like,
okay,

1945
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:59,040
here's the focus of the day.
I need to find water.

1946
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,480
Yeah,
that's it.

1947
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:04,140
Well,
you were drinking buffalo piss water.

1948
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,400
Yeah.
When you guys weren't.

1949
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:11,440
This is a crazy story because it also
involved crocodiles when you guys were

1950
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:16,290
in Australia and you decided you and
crazy fucking Adam green tree decided

1951
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:20,550
let's bring no food.
Go out into the Bush where it's 120

1952
01:31:20,551 --> 01:31:22,550
degrees.
We'll definitely shoot a buffalo and

1953
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:23,460
we'll just eat that.

1954
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:24,271
Yeah,
yeah.

1955
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:24,770
We're,
we're gonna.

1956
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,910
We're gonna live quote,
live off the land.

1957
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:30,240
And uh,
that's probably just happy he found

1958
01:31:30,241 --> 01:31:32,560
someone dumb enough to do that with them
Saturday night.

1959
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,130
I can't believe you listened to me,
mate.

1960
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:36,510
Everybody else has me to fuck off.
Yeah,

1961
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:40,320
it hit him.
And a Owen Strano was there too.

1962
01:31:40,321 --> 01:31:42,120
But uh,
and Owen,

1963
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:45,270
I think he might've brought man.
Did he,

1964
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,990
would he have maybe a,
some kind of a,

1965
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,150
a bar?
I don't know what he had.

1966
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:54,960
I had half of a trail mix thing that I
bought at the airport,

1967
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:55,770
you know,
and that,

1968
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:57,540
that was like gold,
but yeah.

1969
01:31:57,541 --> 01:31:59,530
So we're going to live off the land and
uh,

1970
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,633
yeah,
it was,

1971
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,140
it was miserable.
But,

1972
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:04,180
uh,
so did he talk you into this?

1973
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:05,830
Was it your idea or his idea?
Like who?

1974
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:06,780
It was,
his idea,

1975
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:07,390
of course.
No,

1976
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,223
it's great.

1977
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,450
No,
I thought sounded awesome.

1978
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,700
He's out there shooting the horses and
cats should go.

1979
01:32:12,701 --> 01:32:13,810
Come on.
Let's live off the land.

1980
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,380
No,
I thought it sounded great.

1981
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:19,930
I mean it was fine.
It was,

1982
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:21,370
you know,
I'm used to being miserable.

1983
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:23,560
A little food would have been nice
because as you know,

1984
01:32:23,561 --> 01:32:28,270
like I said today I need to eat like
every hour because you run so much.

1985
01:32:28,271 --> 01:32:30,220
Actually I'm starving right now.
But uh,

1986
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:33,880
that's uh,
well before we launched the new Cameron

1987
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,560
Hanes podcast,
which we will this afternoon.

1988
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,180
I,
we'll get you a protein bar.

1989
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,290
There you go.
Alright.

1990
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:40,330
I saw I saw a quest bar back there.
Yeah,

1991
01:32:40,331 --> 01:32:42,550
there's a lot.
We've got boxes of shit back there.

1992
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:44,650
Plenty of I'm going to steal.
But yeah.

1993
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:47,440
So just,
just living off the land took on a whole

1994
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:51,580
nother challenge to a hard hunt already.
And so I was down for sure.

1995
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:56,050
So you guys were eating only things that
you had shot and then drinking water

1996
01:32:56,051 --> 01:32:59,560
that you found in the water that you
found was all filled with buffalo piss?

1997
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:00,910
Yeah,
because again,

1998
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:02,830
too many buffalo,
I mean,

1999
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:05,020
when you say too many,
if you,

2000
01:33:05,021 --> 01:33:09,070
if anybody's ever watched any of the
videos on the numbers of buffalo from

2001
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:10,540
Asia,
these are enormous.

2002
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:12,130
What do the Cape Buffalo,
whatever they know,

2003
01:33:12,131 --> 01:33:14,860
these are water buffalo water buffalo
and North Cape Buffaloes.

2004
01:33:14,861 --> 01:33:16,530
African won the fight the lines.
Yep.

2005
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:21,560
Enormous giant beasts that are videos on
that.

2006
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,470
Jamie.
Huge,

2007
01:33:23,471 --> 01:33:25,450
huge herds of these things.
Yeah.

2008
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:28,240
No,
but they're pretty wary still.

2009
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,250
I mean they're big animals,
but uh,

2010
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,440
they're not quite,
not quite as worried as a Cape Buffalo,

2011
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:37,520
I don't think because they don't have
lions hunting them,

2012
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:39,670
you know,
but when they're around water,

2013
01:33:39,671 --> 01:33:41,380
they're used to,
the crocodiles been in there.

2014
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:43,960
They definitely are,
are used to,

2015
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:45,730
uh,
looking out for themselves.

2016
01:33:45,731 --> 01:33:47,980
So they're huge animals.
Um,

2017
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:51,130
they can be dangerous because just
because they're so big.

2018
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,370
But uh,
it's their survivors for sure.

2019
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,950
If that's another weird animal to hunt
in Australia,

2020
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:59,680
they hunt domestic cows.
Yeah,

2021
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:01,990
call him scrubble scribbles.
Yeah.

2022
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:05,800
And what a scrub Boulez is a domestic
cow that got loose,

2023
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:06,401
you know,
many,

2024
01:34:06,401 --> 01:34:11,401
many generations ago and now have become
completely feral and you're dealing with

2025
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:16,630
bowls and you know how like when you
ride bulls folks that they buck and kick

2026
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:20,170
and you know how the matador stands in
the middle and the bull just fucking

2027
01:34:20,171 --> 01:34:21,340
charges him.
Tries to kill him.

2028
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:24,370
Yeah.
That's what bulls do in the wild times

2029
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:27,610
10.
So you have these wild for hyper

2030
01:34:27,611 --> 01:34:31,750
aggressive masses of muscle.
And this is a video,

2031
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:33,490
it says cams raw.
What does it say?

2032
01:34:33,491 --> 01:34:35,170
What does the net cams.
Raw and uncut.

2033
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:37,920
Ozzie water buff heart shot.
Yeah.

2034
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:42,370
And this is you sneaking up on this
massive animal.

2035
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:45,000
You've got to walk super slow.
Yeah.

2036
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:48,130
The thing about it is a,
they'll pick up movement,

2037
01:34:48,131 --> 01:34:51,970
but as he's feeding there,
I know I can move so I just go very

2038
01:34:51,971 --> 01:34:54,160
slowly.
I had my range finder up near my face so

2039
01:34:54,161 --> 01:34:57,800
I don't have to reach for it and,
and do a bunch of extra movement there.

2040
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,390
But if you,
uh,

2041
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:00,770
how far away is he?
Right here?

2042
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,780
Probably 50 yards now with the animals.
Is that big?

2043
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:08,600
Why did you decide to keep walking
towards him?

2044
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,880
Closer is better with a bow.
Right.

2045
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:13,790
So you,
you felt like you could get closer so

2046
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:18,050
you might as well just keep going until
you realize that you have to draw.

2047
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:18,880
Yeah,
he,

2048
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,490
uh,
when he.

2049
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:22,610
I'm waiting for them to get broad side
because it's an animal that big.

2050
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:25,220
Um,
you have to,

2051
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:27,410
you just have to wait for a good
broadside shot.

2052
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:31,070
And so here I am arranging them as I
walk and now he's getting ready to go

2053
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,020
broadside.
That's an important point,

2054
01:35:33,021 --> 01:35:35,360
man,
because shot placement is something that

2055
01:35:35,361 --> 01:35:38,720
people that don't understand hunting
don't know how difficult it is to not

2056
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:41,990
just have a shot on an animal,
but have an animal be in position to

2057
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:42,824
take the shot.

2058
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:47,540
I was watching a television show on guys
that were hunting water buffalo with a

2059
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:50,120
bow and Arrow and I saw a guy take a
frontal shot.

2060
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,333
So He's,
he's,

2061
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,990
he's not feeding,
so I'm not moving because he's.

2062
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,840
His head's up with this peripheral.
He could see me.

2063
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,300
So he thinks something's going on here.
He's not.

2064
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,240
He probably caught something.
I mean his ears covering his eye right

2065
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:04,100
there.
You've got to be that focused.

2066
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,410
So I know he's not looking at me right
now,

2067
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:09,980
but he had,
he might've thought he saw something so

2068
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:12,410
he just kind of chilling out.
June is cut.

2069
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:14,870
And how hard is it to stay still here?
It's,

2070
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:15,980
it's all right.
But I need,

2071
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,850
I need him to go broadside.
I need that close leg to go forward

2072
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,770
because if I just draw back and shoot,
you know,

2073
01:36:21,771 --> 01:36:25,130
without that guaranteed going to be
unsuccessful.

2074
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:27,710
So I need that,
that lady to go forward that close like

2075
01:36:27,711 --> 01:36:31,130
right here now that opened up his
vitals.

2076
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,400
Boom.
Perfect.

2077
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,520
Right in there.
And how far away was that?

2078
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:41,340
That was 39 yards.
So their,

2079
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:45,950
their heart sits a.
I mean that you see that blood coming

2080
01:36:45,951 --> 01:36:48,670
out right now.
The heart sits like right next to it.

2081
01:36:48,671 --> 01:36:49,080
It's,
it's,

2082
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,030
it's fine,
right?

2083
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:54,470
It's forward.
It's forward from an elk would be a

2084
01:36:54,471 --> 01:36:56,750
little more back.
But basically you have to go right

2085
01:36:56,751 --> 01:36:59,180
through that front leg.
And uh,

2086
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,280
I shot it really heavy Arrow and 90
pounds,

2087
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:04,630
that's a 90 pound weight right there.
And you can see he's,

2088
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,980
he's already week,
so it's only been,

2089
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,080
you know,
maybe a minute and he's,

2090
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,530
he's about done.
So you have to actually shoot through

2091
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:16,280
the leg itself to get to the heart
unless he's quartering away from you.

2092
01:37:16,281 --> 01:37:17,180
Maybe.
Yeah,

2093
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:19,190
quarter in a way.
The problem is they're so big,

2094
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:24,191
so if it's too to quartering away their
stomachs big and it's full of grass.

2095
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:29,540
So that could essentially be like for an
Arrow to go all the way through a bunch

2096
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:31,550
of grass,
wet grass.

2097
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:35,570
I mean probably not going to happen.
And you're shooting through ribs that

2098
01:37:35,571 --> 01:37:37,700
are as thick as two by fours,
right?

2099
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:41,120
So what a crazy animal he's about bled
out right here.

2100
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:43,130
And,
and the thing with a bow,

2101
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:48,370
I mean these things fight each other.
So he has no idea what happened.

2102
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,960
I mean,
he's just like no clue that he's used to

2103
01:37:50,961 --> 01:37:54,890
getting jabbed with horns or tree
branches or all sorts of stuff.

2104
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,040
All he knows is he's

2105
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,940
lost a lot of blood and boom,
it's over crazy.

2106
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:02,160
Yup.
Now you guys,

2107
01:38:02,161 --> 01:38:05,940
when you went there and you didn't bring
any water with you,

2108
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,150
you have to filter that piss water
somehow,

2109
01:38:09,151 --> 01:38:10,200
right?
Yeah.

2110
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:11,880
What are you,
what do you filter it with?

2111
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:15,320
We had a water filter and we had a
steripen.

2112
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,030
What's that?
It's just like ultraviolet light.

2113
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,060
You put in the water,
you hit it with the ultraviolet light

2114
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:25,980
and then it supposedly disinfected water
supposedly is a key world.

2115
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,520
The only reason why I throw out that is
because we filtered it.

2116
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,190
We stare a pendant,
we poured it through a shirt and it

2117
01:38:33,191 --> 01:38:36,320
still smelled like buffalo pis.
Well,

2118
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:39,450
it is buffalo pis.
We drank paralyzed buffalo pet.

2119
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:43,260
We drank it and we didn't die.
I saw something online the other day.

2120
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:46,800
They were trying to figure out how much
of the ocean is whale piss.

2121
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,670
Like how many?
How many whales are there?

2122
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,070
How long had they been peeing in the
ocean?

2123
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:54,270
Right.
How much of that?

2124
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,090
Where does it go?
How much of the ocean as well pissed and

2125
01:38:57,091 --> 01:38:59,490
we should protest them doing that.
Was dirty,

2126
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,790
stinky wheels.
Yeah.

2127
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,030
So selfish.
I saw a sad thing though,

2128
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:05,310
man,
where this whale died in.

2129
01:39:05,311 --> 01:39:06,144
When the,
uh,

2130
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,720
blue whale was beached,
they examine the contents of its stomach

2131
01:39:09,721 --> 01:39:14,700
and it was filled with fishing nets and
plastic bags because apparently whales

2132
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:19,350
eat a lot of squid and they get confused
at that stuff,

2133
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:21,990
like plastic bags and things along those
lines.

2134
01:39:21,991 --> 01:39:26,580
And they think that it's food and then
they got an intestinal blockage.

2135
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,550
So it died by being backed up.
Yeah.

2136
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:32,490
That's a rough way to go.
That is too bad.

2137
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:35,550
They don't have whale doctors either in
the ocean where they go,

2138
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:38,040
Hey doc,
I'm not feeling so good here.

2139
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,110
So something's going on.
I haven't shaved in a week.

2140
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:43,070
I'm going to check you out.
Yeah,

2141
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,820
no,
my whale is coming out.

2142
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:48,480
Bloody good.
The world,

2143
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:53,100
the world of harsh nature.
We live in that world.

2144
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:56,580
We just don't think we do because we've
created this super cool thing called

2145
01:39:56,581 --> 01:39:58,980
cities.
Yeah.

2146
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:02,250
I don't think it's so cool,
but we definitely created it.

2147
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,170
You're crazy.
You're wearing clothes that was created

2148
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:06,590
in cities.
You're going to watch those creating

2149
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:07,800
cities,
your,

2150
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:09,610
uh,
your bow was created in the city.

2151
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:11,880
I have a fit band.
I don't have that same thing.

2152
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:13,860
It doesn't tell you the time.
I think it does.

2153
01:40:13,861 --> 01:40:14,790
Yeah.
Come on.

2154
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:18,030
It's got to tell you the time it says I
got all time.

2155
01:40:18,031 --> 01:40:20,850
Record seven hours and 49 minutes sleep.
Oh,

2156
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:22,860
that's an all time record.
Well,

2157
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,580
congratulation recently.
Congratulations is in order.

2158
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:28,080
It is.
That's what happens is you get to stay

2159
01:40:28,081 --> 01:40:30,350
in a hotel to work that day.
Yeah.

2160
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,500
No,
it actually does have the time.

2161
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:32,430
Sorry.
There you go.

2162
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:37,050
So you've got to watch a car that you
have to drive around to get to these

2163
01:40:37,051 --> 01:40:42,051
hunting spots that's all created in a
city or you gotta go all this technology

2164
01:40:42,511 --> 01:40:45,630
created by people in civilization that
we're allowed to relax,

2165
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,090
not worried about being eaten by wolves.
And they said,

2166
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:48,810
hey,
uh,

2167
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:51,390
these regular bows that we're using are
kind of bullshit.

2168
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,620
We need some cams and these things,
right?

2169
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:54,040
Like as

2170
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,500
you pull it back,
it lets off at a certain weight and then

2171
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:59,620
it's got more power going forward.
And a bunch of engineers went to

2172
01:40:59,621 --> 01:41:01,750
schools,
they wrote things down on paper and

2173
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:03,820
uncover all that stuff created in
cities.

2174
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:08,470
Yeah.
So like the city and the transition that

2175
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:13,210
some organisms are going through from
wild to civilize actually makes it

2176
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,790
possible for you to exist in the wild
world.

2177
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,890
Again,
just like they'll hunting is

2178
01:41:17,891 --> 01:41:20,110
conservation thing.
How ironic

2179
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:24,370
is something positive to a city?
Is that what you're saying?

2180
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,350
Oh,
100 percent.

2181
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:27,790
One hundred percent.
Listen man,

2182
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:31,750
I'm not into working at a factory for 16
hours a day making iphones,

2183
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:34,900
but if somebody wasn't,
I wouldn't have an iphone and I wouldn't

2184
01:41:34,901 --> 01:41:37,540
be able to tell you that you've got to
press that button twice or shut off your

2185
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:39,890
apps.
I did learn something today like you.

2186
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,070
We all need each other as awesome.

2187
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:47,090
And for a guy like you who is so
invested in living in the wild and

2188
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:49,360
having this challenge of being in the
wild,

2189
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:53,710
you need your nice under armour clothes
to keep your comfy and warm and drive

2190
01:41:53,711 --> 01:41:56,350
and you're out there.
You've got your under or boots that were

2191
01:41:56,351 --> 01:42:00,640
made in some sort of a factory and
designed by some sort of an engineer and

2192
01:42:00,641 --> 01:42:01,480
you got your,
uh,

2193
01:42:01,481 --> 01:42:03,880
your watch tells you what altitude
you're at,

2194
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:07,900
all that stuff is,
is a part of your experience in this

2195
01:42:07,901 --> 01:42:09,130
wild world.
You know,

2196
01:42:09,131 --> 01:42:13,660
you got your gear and you got your sat
phone so you could call home,

2197
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:14,381
you know,
hey,

2198
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:16,630
I just shot the biggest pool of my life
out here in the wild.

2199
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:20,620
I'm talking to you from a fucking
satellite under miles in space.

2200
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:23,860
But that's one reason why I'm not the
greatest when they send me stuff to try

2201
01:42:23,861 --> 01:42:26,770
out because um,
I like being miserable.

2202
01:42:26,771 --> 01:42:29,770
I'm not the greatest for feedback.
So how it perform,

2203
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:31,810
I'm like,
you like being slightly miserable.

2204
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:33,610
Otherwise you'd go out there naked.
Right,

2205
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:34,211
right.
You know,

2206
01:42:34,211 --> 01:42:37,180
because that's one of the,
that's one of the big arguments that the

2207
01:42:37,181 --> 01:42:39,420
non hunters will use against the hunter.
Like,

2208
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:42,760
you're a real man.
Why don't you go kill the fucking oak

2209
01:42:42,761 --> 01:42:43,940
with your wounds?
Right.

2210
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:45,460
Why don't you go out with your hands?

2211
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,000
Well,
that's not the way to do it.

2212
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:51,010
Dummy things,
because you're not going to kill any of

2213
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:52,180
them.
You won't kill them.

2214
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:53,620
That's not how you killed them.
Right?

2215
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:55,330
You know,
just like a rattle snake doesn't kill

2216
01:42:55,331 --> 01:42:58,030
you unless it uses poison.
Rattlesnake just tried to,

2217
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,730
if they didn't have any poison and
wanting to fight me,

2218
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,270
are we going to do.
You're going to stab me with you.

2219
01:43:02,271 --> 01:43:04,300
A little stupid needles.
You know what I'm going to do?

2220
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:06,100
I'm going to crush your fucking head
with a rock.

2221
01:43:06,101 --> 01:43:07,690
Stupid because I have an opposable
thumb.

2222
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,280
So after you stabbed me with your
needle,

2223
01:43:09,281 --> 01:43:11,860
that doesn't have any venom in it
because you want to play fair.

2224
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:13,750
Oh look,
I grab you by your head.

2225
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,000
I smash it with a rock.
I wind dummy.

2226
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:17,290
Wait,
that makes sense though.

2227
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:19,900
Dang it.
Well,

2228
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:23,410
it makes sense because I'm a human being
and I come from a long line of human

2229
01:43:23,411 --> 01:43:26,710
beings and human beings had been
thinking and more importantly we've been

2230
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:27,610
communicating.

2231
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:30,160
We've been communicating with language
and uh,

2232
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:32,440
we,
we remember things that we learned and

2233
01:43:32,441 --> 01:43:36,130
we pass it on to others.
So I think what's going on now,

2234
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:38,800
even though it seems negative and it
seems weird,

2235
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:43,801
and the world of wildlife and hunting
and hunters versus people who don't

2236
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:46,720
hunt,
I think ultimately it all balances out

2237
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,300
really well because it all balances out
in an honest way.

2238
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:52,160
There's going to be people that don't
agree with things no matter what,

2239
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:55,250
just like there's gonna be people that
don't agree with a lot of different

2240
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:56,510
things that a lot of people think are
fun.

2241
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:00,430
There's going to be disagreements,
but in those disagreements we're going

2242
01:44:00,431 --> 01:44:02,960
to find arguments that make sense and
arguments that don't make sense.

2243
01:44:02,961 --> 01:44:07,961
We're going to find people that are
disingenuous and that are not being

2244
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:12,770
totally honest with scientific facts
about nutrition,

2245
01:44:12,771 --> 01:44:16,530
scientific facts about whether or not
humans are omnivores or herbivores.

2246
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:18,350
Uh,
there's a lot of dishonesty because

2247
01:44:18,351 --> 01:44:21,260
these debates are not debates about
facts and reason.

2248
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,050
There are debates about ideology and
they only,

2249
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:29,120
they only promote and subscribe to ideas
that benefit their ideology.

2250
01:44:29,121 --> 01:44:30,950
That's it.
And you get it on both sides.

2251
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:34,390
That's one of the problems with the
hunting is conservation hunting's

2252
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,330
hunting.
Yeah.

2253
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:37,250
Ben O'brien's.
Got It right.

2254
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:42,050
Funding to conservation is a byproduct
of hunting and hunting.

2255
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:45,080
Even if it wasn't conservation,
it was just.

2256
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:48,020
It was just something you do to eat.
It's still.

2257
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:49,850
It's still good.
Yeah.

2258
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:51,380
Yeah.
Still good.

2259
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:53,690
No.
This conversation is important though.

2260
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:57,740
Yeah.
People will talk to for your hunting.

2261
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,750
That's a big one man.
He goes,

2262
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:00,590
dudes.
Joseph Toy.

2263
01:45:00,591 --> 01:45:02,180
You're hooting.
Yeah.

2264
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:04,880
It's true.
Just communication.

2265
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:06,860
Yeah.
About something that,

2266
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:09,140
you know,
I read your fucking instagram.

2267
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:10,790
Yeah.
It's important.

2268
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:12,050
It's A.
Yeah.

2269
01:45:12,051 --> 01:45:13,160
I mean that's,
I don't,

2270
01:45:13,161 --> 01:45:15,710
I try not to engage in the,
in the negative stuff on that,

2271
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:17,150
on instagram,
but I do.

2272
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:19,590
I do talk about the positive attributes
of hunting.

2273
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:20,870
I show,
you know,

2274
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:24,700
skinning out bare.
I show my fees,

2275
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:29,000
freezer full of meat.
I show working hard to be the most

2276
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:31,220
effective ethical hunter I can be.
So yeah,

2277
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:32,660
I try to share all of it.
Yeah.

2278
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:34,280
But you also have people that back you
up.

2279
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:35,960
That's kind of interesting that people
know that,

2280
01:45:35,961 --> 01:45:39,050
so you don't have to really engage in a
bunch of campaigns.

2281
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,540
Soldiers out there.
Guys,

2282
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:45,260
you're fucking instagram page the
battlefield whenever you put some animal

2283
01:45:45,261 --> 01:45:46,190
up,
all my goodness,

2284
01:45:46,191 --> 01:45:51,191
and it's a lot of Europeans ally now
it's that they're the most detached

2285
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:54,200
because they have the fewest percentage
of hundreds over there.

2286
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:56,150
Yeah,
I mean I always get stuff from over

2287
01:45:56,151 --> 01:45:58,610
there.
They just have no concept or people.

2288
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:00,110
Even Brazil,
you know,

2289
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:02,750
you get just.
Brazil's a big one.

2290
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:03,623
Yeah,
that's a big one.

2291
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,120
Yeah.
A lot of hate from there.

2292
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:06,441
Um,
yeah.

2293
01:46:06,441 --> 01:46:08,780
Someone was talking to me about that the
other day.

2294
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,450
Someone was saying like,
how many people get upset about it

2295
01:46:11,451 --> 01:46:12,980
might've been shamed.
Was it Shane Dorian?

2296
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:17,340
Um,
but there's what you,

2297
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:21,430
when you hear the Robin Hood Story,
like when people think about Robin Hood

2298
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:23,090
Robinson and bridge and gives to the
poor.

2299
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:27,530
What people don't understand is that was
originally about food.

2300
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:31,790
It was about him being able to hunt on
private land that the king owned because

2301
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:35,210
people are starving.
That was the original story of Robin

2302
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:37,400
Hood.
It's about Robin Hood going out and

2303
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:40,910
shooting these animals and bringing meat
back to people.

2304
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:46,120
Because in Europe,
in a lot of countries you are only able

2305
01:46:46,371 --> 01:46:50,070
to hunt on private land because there is
no public land.

2306
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:55,320
We are incredibly lucky in this country
in that I was in yellowstone this

2307
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,120
weekend,
told you I went up there and fucking

2308
01:46:57,121 --> 01:46:57,960
amazing man.

2309
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,870
What an amazing thing and that's a non
hunting thing,

2310
01:47:00,871 --> 01:47:01,830
right?
Yellowstone.

2311
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:05,670
You can't hunt there,
but this concept of public land,

2312
01:47:05,671 --> 01:47:07,770
this concept of more than a million
acres,

2313
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:10,590
I don't know how many millions of acres.
Yellowstone is a big,

2314
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:15,030
big chunk of property,
credible place that they can't build

2315
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:16,980
things on.
You can't replace it,

2316
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:22,160
can't put them all there and it's just
wild and natural and it's ours.

2317
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:28,160
It's by an act of Congress.
Back before they had fucking cars wrap

2318
01:47:28,381 --> 01:47:31,290
your head around that.
They figured out before they had cars,

2319
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:31,821
they're like,
Yo,

2320
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:34,530
we gotta do something about this place.
This is too good.

2321
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,140
Yeah,
we can't let anybody corrupt this and

2322
01:47:37,141 --> 01:47:39,660
this is what was wrong with where we
came from,

2323
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,150
where we came from.
Everybody owned all the land.

2324
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:45,840
It was all private and no one.
You didn't have a place where you could

2325
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:49,620
just go backpacking and just camp out.

2326
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:54,030
We have all these designated areas,
designated areas that are all public

2327
01:47:54,031 --> 01:47:58,650
land owned by the taxpayers of the
United States and whether you appreciate

2328
01:47:58,651 --> 01:48:02,040
hunting or whether you just appreciate
camping or hiking or any of those

2329
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:04,830
things.
We have a beautiful thing in this

2330
01:48:04,831 --> 01:48:09,320
country.
Whereas the wild world that we're the.

2331
01:48:09,321 --> 01:48:13,770
The actual beautiful environment of
these forests and most of the areas are

2332
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:17,160
in a lot of the areas.
All the areas designated as public land.

2333
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,830
They're ours.
They're yours there.

2334
01:48:19,831 --> 01:48:21,450
Jamie's there.
Everybody that's listening.

2335
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:23,370
All every,
all the people that live here and even

2336
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:25,320
if even if the listeners aren't gonna
hunt,

2337
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:29,550
which fine not everybody has to hunt,
but I would say get out there to

2338
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:32,730
yellowstone or there's some national
forest here in California,

2339
01:48:32,731 --> 01:48:35,730
some great.
Just get out there and experience life.

2340
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:37,920
You know?
I mean because living in the city isn't

2341
01:48:37,921 --> 01:48:39,210
experiencing life well.

2342
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:42,210
It's experiencing life in the city.
It's life that's.

2343
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:45,780
But it's not.
It's almost like you have a TV that only

2344
01:48:45,781 --> 01:48:48,510
shows three different colors.
You get a little bit of red,

2345
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:49,740
a little bit of why?
A little bit of black.

2346
01:48:49,741 --> 01:48:50,730
That's it.
So you get.

2347
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:53,250
Yeah,
and you don't know what it looks like if

2348
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:57,260
you're watching like Avatar and a
beautiful four K tv and you're like all

2349
01:48:57,270 --> 01:49:01,140
the beautiful magical colors and wow,
you've never seen it before.

2350
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:06,480
You're experiencing a muted connection
with your food and a very muted

2351
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:11,280
connection with wildlife that sometimes
it's fucking uncomfortable and scary.

2352
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:12,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

2353
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,940
But it's also real.
It's bulk.

2354
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,130
Yeah.
You know,

2355
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,300
I've had some,
I've had some great hunts.

2356
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:21,240
Marble Mountain wilderness up in
northern California.

2357
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:22,830
Where's that?
What part?

2358
01:49:23,410 --> 01:49:25,710
This is just south of Oregon.
Oh yeah.

2359
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:27,540
Where were you?
What'd you do up there?

2360
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:30,330
A deer hunt killed a nice black tail
buck.

2361
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:34,110
Was it like up there?
A mountains dense?

2362
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,700
Yeah,
it's a timber.

2363
01:49:36,210 --> 01:49:37,740
It's great country.
Big,

2364
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,290
big country.
I'm pretty rugged.

2365
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:42,120
Yolie,
bullied wilderness.

2366
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:44,970
Huge area.
Whereas that same area,

2367
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:46,170
so little little,
uh,

2368
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:47,980
um,
it's near

2369
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,830
Marble Mountain wilderness.
Another giant area.

2370
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,490
So many bear.
There's,

2371
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,520
you almost seemed more bear than deer up
there.

2372
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:57,550
Really [inaudible] why is that?
I don't know.

2373
01:49:57,570 --> 01:50:01,420
It's great habitat so you can go up
there and you can buy a deer tag and a

2374
01:50:01,421 --> 01:50:04,020
bear tag when I went there about 160
bucks for,

2375
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:08,260
for non state resident or a non resident
of California out of state,

2376
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,290
um,
hunter and a,

2377
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:13,270
for a resident of California,
probably super cheap,

2378
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:14,283
you know,
um,

2379
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:16,870
but great hunting.
So you can go up there and hunt deer and

2380
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:19,180
hunt bear.
Same same time.

2381
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:22,210
A camp out.
Survive

2382
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:24,910
sees the stars and their natural way.
Yeah.

2383
01:50:25,290 --> 01:50:26,200
Yeah.
All those things.

2384
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:29,460
It opens up a,
like Megan mid August.

2385
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:32,240
Well,
there's just an appreciation for this

2386
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:36,260
strange planet when you.
You're viewing the lifeforms on it.

2387
01:50:36,261 --> 01:50:39,230
What does this Jamie picture at marble
mountain.

2388
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:40,580
Wow.
God.

2389
01:50:40,581 --> 01:50:41,510
Damn.
That's beautiful.

2390
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,510
So pretty.
Is that why it's called Marble Mountain?

2391
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:46,880
Marble Mountain?
It looks like it's made out of marble.

2392
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:50,370
Does look like raw marble.
Yeah.

2393
01:50:50,371 --> 01:50:51,590
Is it,
is it made out of marble?

2394
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:55,250
Is that what the Rock is?
People go there to make countertops.

2395
01:50:55,910 --> 01:50:58,400
They're stealing from the land to make
someone's counter.

2396
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:00,530
Yeah.
But isn't that amazing?

2397
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,090
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

2398
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:05,100
Um,
when I was in Montana this past week and

2399
01:51:05,101 --> 01:51:07,250
went to the yellowstone thing,
I mean,

2400
01:51:07,251 --> 01:51:11,300
you just be driving and you would just
drive and just look down the street and

2401
01:51:11,301 --> 01:51:12,134
go,
fuck,

2402
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:14,450
this is crazy.
This place is crazy.

2403
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:16,790
This,
this view is like,

2404
01:51:16,791 --> 01:51:18,410
um,
it's like a drug,

2405
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:23,720
like you're taking in this incredible
mountain side covered in trees and the

2406
01:51:23,721 --> 01:51:28,460
sunlight is hitting the trees and it had
just got done raining and everything was

2407
01:51:28,461 --> 01:51:31,640
a vibrant and green and you're like,
this is a drug.

2408
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:34,730
Like I'm getting an eyeball drug by
staring at this thing.

2409
01:51:34,731 --> 01:51:36,860
Like it's doing something to me
physically.

2410
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,400
Will you just go,
wow.

2411
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,750
It makes you feel good to see it.

2412
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:44,550
Well,
when I'm at Marble Mountain Wilderness

2413
01:51:44,551 --> 01:51:45,900
district,
I mean that's public land.

2414
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:49,260
Anybody can go there,
you can go there anytime you want.

2415
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,990
And uh,
when I'm there,

2416
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:55,230
what I feel like when.
So if you were at that exact same place

2417
01:51:55,231 --> 01:51:57,030
that,
that Jamie just had a picture of,

2418
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,960
you feel small,
you feel the countries big,

2419
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:05,880
you feel insignificant really compared
to how grand the country is.

2420
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:08,430
And for me personally,
for,

2421
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,020
I think for everybody,
it's good,

2422
01:52:10,050 --> 01:52:13,290
it's good to feel small.
Sometimes people elevate themselves,

2423
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:15,840
people make themselves more important
than they really are.

2424
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:17,760
That's a real.
I mean,

2425
01:52:17,761 --> 01:52:21,960
that puts you in check back there
because you realize if anything happens

2426
01:52:21,961 --> 01:52:24,000
back here,
does anybody even know.

2427
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:25,080
I mean,
they'll find out,

2428
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:30,150
but I'm just another not too much
different than an ant back here.

2429
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,040
If I die,
nothing's going to change.

2430
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:34,180
The wind's going still blow.
Um,

2431
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,480
you know,
that lions are still going to try to

2432
01:52:36,481 --> 01:52:38,850
kill deer.
The elk are still going to try to breed

2433
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:40,950
nothing changes.
So it's good.

2434
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:45,000
I think it's good to have that feeling
every once in a while to realize,

2435
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:45,913
know what?

2436
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:48,580
I'm not that special.
Yes.

2437
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:50,150
That's why I love the wilderness.
Well,

2438
01:52:50,151 --> 01:52:54,660
there's an inescapable understanding
when you're,

2439
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:59,570
you're faced with the enormity of nature
is like everything to the left you

2440
01:52:59,571 --> 01:53:01,710
everything to the right and everything
as far as the eye can say.

2441
01:53:01,711 --> 01:53:05,660
He doesn't give a fuck.
And it's all been this way for who knows

2442
01:53:05,661 --> 01:53:07,880
how long.
And it will be this way for who knows

2443
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:11,450
how long after you're gone.
This is just this life factory and it's

2444
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,700
all going on all around you and it
doesn't care about you.

2445
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:18,530
Now you were just an entrance.
You're an entrant in this weird sort of

2446
01:53:18,531 --> 01:53:23,180
a race that's going on where things are
trying to get by,

2447
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:26,660
things just trying to get by,
by eating all the grasses the grasses

2448
01:53:26,661 --> 01:53:29,450
are trying to get by,
by producing some sort of a chemical

2449
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:31,250
that discourages these things to eat
them.

2450
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:34,280
The animals are trying to run from the
other animals that are trying to eat

2451
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:35,430
them.
And,

2452
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:39,980
and we're all just hanging out watching
or participating but in,

2453
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:44,300
you know,
in regular life and everybody's so

2454
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:47,930
worried about people's feelings and
people being,

2455
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:51,450
um,
fairly treated or people,

2456
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:52,700
whatever.
And it's just like,

2457
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:53,720
it's,
it just gets.

2458
01:53:53,721 --> 01:53:56,000
So I get it.
I want,

2459
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:57,860
you know,
everybody should be treated fairly.

2460
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:00,590
But I like when it's just black and
white.

2461
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:04,160
I like when I'm in the mountains,
I don't have to worry about or even

2462
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:09,190
think about everybody's cause cause of
the day or I don't know.

2463
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,233
I mean,
it's just,

2464
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,750
it puts it in perspective,
it does put it in perspective and I

2465
01:54:14,751 --> 01:54:18,230
think it would be good for everybody,
including people that are really

2466
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,580
invested in these causes to experience
this because I think it broadens your

2467
01:54:22,581 --> 01:54:24,140
perspective.
And again,

2468
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:26,210
even if you're just hiking out there,
like I said,

2469
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:29,270
my,
the hunt that made me feel the most

2470
01:54:29,271 --> 01:54:30,830
thankful was an unsuccessful one.

2471
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:32,720
So while we were doing was hiking with
guns.

2472
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:35,660
So we went hiking with guns for five
days in the rain.

2473
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:37,750
Yeah.
And I came back and I felt so goddamn

2474
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:38,600
good.
Yeah.

2475
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,540
And not just good about like the ability
to have food,

2476
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:43,700
um,
to not have to go out and hunt and kill

2477
01:54:43,701 --> 01:54:46,310
it because we were unsuccessful.
But that,

2478
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:49,230
this is a,
this is a really cool thing that we

2479
01:54:49,231 --> 01:54:51,320
figured out how to do to escape that
world,

2480
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:55,970
that world of harsh,
brutal nature that the tooth thing and

2481
01:54:55,971 --> 01:54:59,780
claw world.
But you're not going to appreciate that

2482
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,820
unless you go in there and there.
Yeah.

2483
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:04,430
That in there though,
that's where it gets hard.

2484
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:08,360
It's hard to convince people like it's
hard to convince fat people to get off

2485
01:55:08,361 --> 01:55:10,120
the couch,
you know?

2486
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:14,160
It's hard.
It's hard to convince people that it

2487
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:16,310
probably would benefit them to be
uncomfortable.

2488
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:18,020
Yeah,
that's.

2489
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:23,060
We're addicted to comfort for sure.
You're addicted to being uncomfortable.

2490
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:27,440
Just makes you real fucking weird.
Your captain uncomfortable.

2491
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,640
That's your new name.
That's your podcast name.

2492
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:31,070
Oh,
captain uncomfortable.

2493
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:33,350
So let's talk about that because we're
gonna.

2494
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:37,550
We're gonna end this soon and we're
going to start the first episode of the

2495
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:39,830
Cameron Hanes podcasts,
but we have to have a name for it.

2496
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,980
What did we come up with?
Keep hammering is a good one.

2497
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,480
Yeah,
I liked that.

2498
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:48,720
You know why?
Because that's the first thing that I

2499
01:55:48,721 --> 01:55:52,560
ever heard from you or about you.
I might even heard that before I met

2500
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:53,394
you.
Yeah.

2501
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:55,140
And I was like,
look at this fucking dude out there

2502
01:55:55,141 --> 01:55:56,450
working and his,
his,

2503
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:58,840
his,
his constant catchphrases.

2504
01:55:58,860 --> 01:55:59,710
Keep hammering.
It might.

2505
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:02,400
Yeah.
That's a good thing to think of.

2506
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:05,500
If you're thinking about quitting,
like if you think about every year even

2507
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:07,650
like I'm going to run five miles a day
and then that third mile I'm like,

2508
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:08,850
fuck,
I want to do this,

2509
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,250
and you just say,
God fucking keep hammering.

2510
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,390
Yeah.
I'm going to keep hammering.

2511
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:17,490
The mindset of pushing yourself forward
is is a good mindset?

2512
01:56:17,491 --> 01:56:20,970
It's a good mindset to have because God
damn comfortable.

2513
01:56:20,971 --> 01:56:25,971
Soft das water balloon full of blood
body wants you to take breaks.

2514
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:29,100
Yeah,
that bitch ass body does.

2515
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:32,130
It's begging for a break bitch ass body.

2516
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:33,420
We have.
What do you think,

2517
01:56:33,421 --> 01:56:34,380
Jamie?
Keep hammering.

2518
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,080
Yeah,
that's sounds like a great one.

2519
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:40,830
Or filthy skills.
Filtered skills as confusing though.

2520
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:42,630
It's.
It's a little inside joke.

2521
01:56:42,631 --> 01:56:45,060
A little bit.
That's why might be better for a shirt.

2522
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:47,220
It's like if I call this podcast,
let's get lucrative,

2523
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:50,770
filthy sluts and go lots of ways.
Right?

2524
01:56:50,771 --> 01:56:52,530
So could be.
Could be grossly.

2525
01:56:52,531 --> 01:56:54,890
People think dirty porn,
right?

2526
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:57,840
I think filled these skills might be
better as a shirt.

2527
01:56:58,090 --> 01:57:02,400
Okay,
so a hanes world,

2528
01:57:02,490 --> 01:57:04,800
like Wayne's world.
Somebody had one.

2529
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:07,860
They made a poster right there.
I make an online thing,

2530
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:09,110
so last week.
Yeah,

2531
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:10,860
look,
but you need a sidekick.

2532
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:13,440
Who would you be?
Would you be the Mike Myers or would you

2533
01:57:13,441 --> 01:57:15,870
be the Dana Carvey?
Garth.

2534
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,130
He'd be good.
Wayne was Wayne.

2535
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:20,910
Wayne,
Wayne and Garth was A.

2536
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:22,400
Garth was Dana carvey.
Yeah.

2537
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:27,300
Kinda like garth better.
You like garth better than the Wayne lot

2538
01:57:27,301 --> 01:57:28,134
better.

2539
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:31,680
Well that's my boy.
I don't have a sidekick though.

2540
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,500
You know you don't have a sidekick.
You just sidekick dude.

2541
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:37,310
Who'd we get?
We need a.

2542
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:41,520
You need a,
like someone to argue with you like some

2543
01:57:41,521 --> 01:57:45,300
vegan sort of nick tooth type character
to do battle with.

2544
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:47,460
That's a whole different show.
I don't know,

2545
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:49,350
but I'm just trying to like be in a
network.

2546
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:51,510
I'm like a negative network network
executive.

2547
01:57:51,511 --> 01:57:53,490
Trying to fuck up your original idea.
We need.

2548
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:56,460
We need drama.
We need a wacky neighbor.

2549
01:57:57,730 --> 01:58:01,260
You're showing you the gay neighbor
who's a Vegan.

2550
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:03,070
Who gets mad at you,
right?

2551
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,020
Yeah,
yeah.

2552
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,730
Yeah.
It takes your meat out and he throws it

2553
01:58:05,731 --> 01:58:09,990
out in the outside and it goes bad to
punish you for killing animals.

2554
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:10,990
Okay,
well that's,

2555
01:58:10,991 --> 01:58:14,430
that's episode one will have to put out
a feeler for that.

2556
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:17,070
Just plenty of those dudes out there.
You can find them.

2557
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,740
Just go through your instagram comments
and pluck them out.

2558
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:21,840
You got to get them to come here from
Europe though.

2559
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:24,250
Yeah,
well I know.

2560
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:29,470
I know one guy who shared a picture of a
bear I killed on on his site and he

2561
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:33,810
brought me a lot of hate mail.
Maybe he'd be my side kick.

2562
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,460
There's a lot of those dudes.
Yeah,

2563
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:37,470
there's a lot of those.
A lot of them are like Vegan

2564
01:58:37,471 --> 01:58:38,980
bodybuilders.
Just really interested.

2565
01:58:38,981 --> 01:58:39,960
That's the guy.
Yeah,

2566
01:58:39,961 --> 01:58:42,310
well there's a bunch of those steroid

2567
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:43,300
users.
By the way.

2568
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:47,860
Steroid users now does anything wrong
with steroids,

2569
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:50,200
but you motherfuckers on talking about
that.

2570
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,150
I see the size of your muscles.
I see your diet and that doesn't make

2571
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:57,670
sense to me.
You're not taking in enough fat to

2572
01:58:57,671 --> 01:59:00,190
produce the kind of testosterone that
you need to develop those kinds of

2573
01:59:00,191 --> 01:59:01,870
muscles.
You're just not,

2574
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,710
and you guys are lean as fuck in.
Your muscles are massive.

2575
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:07,270
I see it.
I know what you're doing.

2576
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:12,271
You're on dirt roads and by the way,
a lot of those steroids aren't the and

2577
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:19,330
they require bacteria.
They were acquired dead life in order to

2578
01:59:19,331 --> 01:59:21,260
create.
Some of it's vague,

2579
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:24,060
they actually make testosterone for wild
yams.

2580
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:25,750
Hmm.
Interesting.

2581
01:59:25,751 --> 01:59:26,880
Right?
I didn't know that.

2582
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,840
Um,
but uh,

2583
01:59:28,841 --> 01:59:32,170
either way you got this like some
hypocritical horseshit going on.

2584
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,510
There's also a lot of like weird
posturing going on.

2585
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:37,780
The part of the reason why they're doing
it is because they want to appear to be

2586
01:59:37,781 --> 01:59:41,560
very noble and it's what's called
Michael Sherman calls it a virtue.

2587
01:59:41,561 --> 01:59:46,561
Signaling Schermer is a very famous
skeptic and intellectual and uh,

2588
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:48,860
he's like,
this is what they're doing.

2589
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:50,770
Like there was signaling to the people
around them,

2590
01:59:51,130 --> 01:59:53,960
sort of like when an elk bugles is to
let all the other elk.

2591
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:55,630
No,
he's a bad motherfucker.

2592
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:56,473
I.
Well,

2593
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,940
by having all these anti hunters,
which is a,

2594
01:59:59,941 --> 02:00:02,560
like you're gonna if you have an anti
hunter post,

2595
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:06,130
you're absolutely going to have a bunch
of people to take your side.

2596
02:00:06,131 --> 02:00:07,330
Yeah.
Fuck those people.

2597
02:00:07,331 --> 02:00:09,580
Right.
But they also get to see how good your

2598
02:00:09,581 --> 02:00:12,040
six pack looks.
So you say fuck those people,

2599
02:00:12,041 --> 02:00:15,340
but you're also oil down and you're
talking about,

2600
02:00:15,341 --> 02:00:17,170
you know,
cruelty free,

2601
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:20,590
you know,
awesome life and healthy living while

2602
02:00:20,591 --> 02:00:23,260
you're like overhead pressing a lot of
weight,

2603
02:00:23,261 --> 02:00:26,680
you look sleek and you probably get some
pussy that way and that's what these

2604
02:00:26,681 --> 02:00:27,370
guys are doing.

2605
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:30,520
There's a lot of that going on.
It's not a coincidence that some of the

2606
02:00:30,521 --> 02:00:34,900
contest fucks are also some of the ones
who are the most into their physiques.

2607
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,610
Right?
I see what you're doing.

2608
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:40,600
I know what you're doing.
I guarantee you if you got those guys

2609
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:43,660
alone with no one watching and he had a
conversation with them,

2610
02:00:43,661 --> 02:00:46,390
they would fall apart.
I guarantee you their arguments would

2611
02:00:46,391 --> 02:00:49,030
fall apart.
Their motivations would fall apart if

2612
02:00:49,031 --> 02:00:50,860
there's no one there to cheer them on or
help them.

2613
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:53,260
He actually got to see them as a human
being.

2614
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:58,110
Having a communication with you as a
human being about why it is that you're

2615
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:01,720
spreading this kind of hate and then you
get into the very specifics of this and

2616
02:01:01,721 --> 02:01:06,721
you realize this argument is long and
vast and super complex.

2617
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:10,300
You guys are trying to make it look like
it's not trying to make it look like you

2618
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:12,130
eating that salad.
You're the best ever.

2619
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:13,750
You're super awesome.
Yeah.

2620
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,360
You're better than us as hunters.
Exactly.

2621
02:01:16,370 --> 02:01:19,900
That's why you're better than people who
don't do what you do.

2622
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:21,520
Even though you just started doing it
four months ago.

2623
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:22,583
Exactly.

2624
02:01:24,670 --> 02:01:27,520
So irritated.
Did you see the video of the dude who

2625
02:01:27,521 --> 02:01:30,790
was a eating a pizza?
It's got cheese in it and he fucking

2626
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:33,340
freaks out.
He's a Vegan and he's talking about how

2627
02:01:33,341 --> 02:01:37,060
awesome it is to be Vegan and then
realizes in the middle of the video that

2628
02:01:37,061 --> 02:01:39,800
the,
the pizza has cheese and sauce with it

2629
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:41,330
and he goes ballistic.
Yeah.

2630
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:43,790
Yeah,
because there's a long video.

2631
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:45,590
Oh,
and it's just.

2632
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,730
He throws his phone.
He screamed and yelled.

2633
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,470
He's so angry.
And in the,

2634
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:54,290
in the video he's talking about like,
you can't say that you're a good person

2635
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:57,650
if you're not vegan.
You can't say that you're a person who

2636
02:01:57,651 --> 02:01:59,630
tries to be a good person.
Well,

2637
02:01:59,631 --> 02:02:01,040
if that's the case,
why aren't you Vegan?

2638
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,040
Like,
boy.

2639
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,330
Well,
you fucking nailed it.

2640
02:02:05,331 --> 02:02:06,910
You made it so simple.
Yeah.

2641
02:02:06,911 --> 02:02:10,910
Well his mom ordered the pizza,
so it was just a misunderstanding.

2642
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:13,700
It's very hilarious,
but this is a guy.

2643
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:17,010
It's like we'd have to play this band
done.

2644
02:02:17,011 --> 02:02:18,440
Oh No,
I don't want to shit on this guy.

2645
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:21,430
You can go find it if you want folks.
I don't want to play it or shit on this

2646
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,940
guy.
He's just a young kid.

2647
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:26,120
He's got his ideas and maybe in his mind
he's right,

2648
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:31,630
but I just found the folly and watching
him freak out over some cheese.

2649
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:35,060
I get it.
Cows or look,

2650
02:02:35,061 --> 02:02:37,220
man,
if you want something to be upset about

2651
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,300
rather than hunters,
it is absolutely the fucking dairy

2652
02:02:41,301 --> 02:02:46,190
industry and agricultural gag laws.
These AG gag lungs that don't allow you

2653
02:02:46,191 --> 02:02:49,850
to film these chicken factories where
these things are stuffed into these

2654
02:02:49,851 --> 02:02:52,490
horrible conditions or pig factories or
factory farming.

2655
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:56,630
I'm 100 percent with you.
I think it is one of the worst aspects

2656
02:02:56,631 --> 02:03:00,140
of civilization.
The way we acquire our protein and

2657
02:03:00,141 --> 02:03:02,570
here's,
here's another real problem and a

2658
02:03:02,571 --> 02:03:04,700
contradiction and for guys like you and
I,

2659
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:06,470
we don't really have an argument against
this.

2660
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:11,180
Not Everybody can hunt and if you want
to eat meat and you want to do it in an

2661
02:03:11,181 --> 02:03:14,180
ethical way,
you you have a real dilemma that they

2662
02:03:14,181 --> 02:03:16,940
are pointing out.
I think that by point,

2663
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,990
by going against hunters though,
they're,

2664
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:22,010
they're missing.
They're missing the mark in a big,

2665
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:22,940
big,
big way.

2666
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:25,580
You're missing the mark in a giant wet.
We're not the enemy.

2667
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:26,493
No,
definitely.

2668
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:29,690
But I mean if you do want to eat me and
you,

2669
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,000
you don't hunt,
there are place.

2670
02:03:32,001 --> 02:03:36,560
I mean my buddy Adam La Roche owns a
three ranch and that's a free range.

2671
02:03:36,830 --> 02:03:37,640
Yeah,
you can do it.

2672
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:40,940
It can be done,
but it's expensive and you're not going

2673
02:03:40,941 --> 02:03:45,050
to get it at Mcdonald's and it's.
If you want a quick cheeseburger and you

2674
02:03:45,051 --> 02:03:46,580
want to pull into that Wendy's drive
through,

2675
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:48,890
boy,
you got to put those fucking those

2676
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:50,350
ethical blinders on.
Yeah.

2677
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:51,370
You have to.
Yup.

2678
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:54,620
And they're in that sense.
Take a break from ethics that day.

2679
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:56,270
Yep.
And in that sense,

2680
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:00,470
all these vegans are right in that sense
when they're talking about how animals

2681
02:04:00,471 --> 02:04:02,990
are being treated,
where we're getting our milk from and

2682
02:04:02,991 --> 02:04:06,260
our cheese from it.
And in most of these large scale

2683
02:04:06,261 --> 02:04:07,680
factories,
they're there,

2684
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:09,200
right?
They're 100 percent right?

2685
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:12,080
And I'm with him.
I just think that this whole

2686
02:04:12,081 --> 02:04:17,081
conversation is really about human
beings and civilization itself and our

2687
02:04:18,321 --> 02:04:23,321
ability to diffuse responsibility,
our ability to detach ourselves and just

2688
02:04:25,161 --> 02:04:27,980
like we're talking about these people
that consume grain and don't think about

2689
02:04:27,981 --> 02:04:29,570
the consequences of life.

2690
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:32,900
These people that consume all sorts of
vegetables that are used,

2691
02:04:32,901 --> 02:04:34,940
that pesticides are used,
that are killing off bs.

2692
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:37,650
This is a huge issue that you contribute
to.

2693
02:04:37,651 --> 02:04:38,830
I do all,
all the,

2694
02:04:39,190 --> 02:04:42,930
all the people that we know that eat
fruits and vegetables most likely having

2695
02:04:42,931 --> 02:04:47,220
some way contributed to the large scale
death of a lot of different insects and

2696
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:49,470
animals is just a part of being a
person.

2697
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:53,520
And you can't deny that.
If you try to deny that and say,

2698
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:55,230
well,
I'm trying to do the least harm

2699
02:04:55,231 --> 02:04:56,520
possible.
That's great.

2700
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:58,890
That's like trying to say like,
I'm a serial killer,

2701
02:04:59,070 --> 02:05:02,820
but I only like to kill once a month.
I got this fucking guy argued with me

2702
02:05:02,821 --> 02:05:04,170
and one of the things he was arguing,
he's guy,

2703
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:06,030
I'm 90 percent vegetarian.

2704
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:09,310
Oh,
what does that me,

2705
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:12,100
it's fucking ridiculous.
But that's the same thing.

2706
02:05:12,170 --> 02:05:14,830
That's the same thing as saying you're a
Vegan.

2707
02:05:14,890 --> 02:05:18,640
I am to six hours and I'm sleeping total
vegetarian.

2708
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:21,580
So what is that?
That's 25 percent.

2709
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:22,840
Yeah.
You're not eating at all during that

2710
02:05:22,841 --> 02:05:23,410
time?
No.

2711
02:05:23,410 --> 02:05:24,750
You're an Eriterian,
right?

2712
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:26,830
So I'm like,
I'm better than him,

2713
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,260
but if you can,
if you contributing to death,

2714
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:32,680
then you really can't say anything and
everyone's contributing to death.

2715
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:35,620
If you live in a house,
if your house was made out of wood,

2716
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:40,950
if trees were fell to build your house,
animals died.

2717
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:43,060
Do you know what Michael p dot?
Absolutely.

2718
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:46,000
And their habitat was displaced.
And do you know what Michael Pollan

2719
02:05:46,001 --> 02:05:47,710
says?
He's the guy who wrote that book,

2720
02:05:47,711 --> 02:05:48,910
the Omnivore's dilemma.
Very,

2721
02:05:48,911 --> 02:05:52,810
very fascinating guy.
He said that they have done research

2722
02:05:52,811 --> 02:05:57,811
where they have played the sound of
animals eating leaves and plants next to

2723
02:05:59,591 --> 02:06:04,591
plants and somehow or another the very
sound of those animals eating plants

2724
02:06:06,370 --> 02:06:10,000
causes the plants to excrete defensive
chemicals.

2725
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:12,700
So somehow or another,
these plants,

2726
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:15,610
they're not just feeling that someone's
eating them,

2727
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:20,020
they are hearing it and they're aware
and they're reacting to sound.

2728
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:25,200
And so I'm sort of a strange way that is
commensurate with the way an animal

2729
02:06:25,571 --> 02:06:28,300
reacts to danger in some sort of a
strange way.

2730
02:06:28,330 --> 02:06:32,170
He also says that they produce some
human neurochemistry chemicals like

2731
02:06:32,171 --> 02:06:33,650
Serotonin and dopamine.
They,

2732
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:36,820
they produce commensurate chemicals and
we don't know why.

2733
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:38,530
We don't know what's going on.
Then.

2734
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:42,400
Crazy fucking nuts,
nuts.

2735
02:06:42,530 --> 02:06:44,020
Um,
I had to read it like three or four

2736
02:06:44,021 --> 02:06:44,741
times.
I'm like,

2737
02:06:44,741 --> 02:06:49,741
wait a minute.
They played sounds of animals eating

2738
02:06:49,871 --> 02:06:52,000
plants next to the plants and the plants
are.

2739
02:06:53,670 --> 02:06:55,500
That's actually a pretty barbaric to do
that.

2740
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,090
It's rude.
Yeah.

2741
02:06:57,270 --> 02:06:58,000
Either one,

2742
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,970
don't eat them.
Don't torture them.

2743
02:06:58,971 --> 02:07:01,160
First it's like,
you know,

2744
02:07:01,161 --> 02:07:03,860
you wouldn't kill cows,
but before you kill them,

2745
02:07:03,861 --> 02:07:05,660
you play this horrible sound.

2746
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:08,620
Yeah.
Other cows getting killed?

2747
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:09,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

2748
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:12,130
The bad news for Vegetarians,
plants can hear themselves being eaten

2749
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:15,910
and become defensive.
When attached attacked researchers from

2750
02:07:15,911 --> 02:07:18,490
the University of Missouri found plants
respond to attack.

2751
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,660
They discovered that the sound of
caterpillars eating made them more

2752
02:07:22,661 --> 02:07:26,800
defensive and plants that heard
caterpillar sounds released more mustard

2753
02:07:26,801 --> 02:07:30,460
oils which are unappealing to
caterpillars and thus ward them off.

2754
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,680
Wow,
wow.

2755
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:36,610
But plants that heard the wind,
despite having similar acoustic sound,

2756
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,040
knew not to waste their defensive
capabilities.

2757
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:43,960
Although this suggests that plants are
able to identify sounds in their

2758
02:07:43,961 --> 02:07:45,880
environment.
That makes sense,

2759
02:07:45,881 --> 02:07:48,070
man.
Most people don't give it a second

2760
02:07:48,071 --> 02:07:50,080
thought when they're tucking into a
plate of salad,

2761
02:07:50,081 --> 02:07:53,260
but perhaps we should be a bit more
considerate when chomping on lettuce.

2762
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:55,060
Now,
scientists have found that plants

2763
02:07:55,061 --> 02:07:57,810
actually respond defensively.
You just need to accept the fact that

2764
02:07:57,811 --> 02:08:00,190
life eats life.
Life eats life is to it.

2765
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,650
Well,
that doesn't allow you to be

2766
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:05,770
sanctimonious or,
or to take the moral high ground.

2767
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:09,460
So I'm going to have to say you're full
of shit in a piece of fucking human

2768
02:08:09,461 --> 02:08:12,670
garbage and you're out there raping the
world with your filthy skills.

2769
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:14,170
By the way,
you can get this filthy skills,

2770
02:08:14,171 --> 02:08:16,720
tee skills with a z.
like the young kids are doing these

2771
02:08:16,721 --> 02:08:19,300
crazy kids.

All right,
we're going to come back in this time.

2776
02:08:24,510 --> 02:08:26,100
Cam's going to do all the talking
because I can't,

2777
02:08:26,101 --> 02:08:28,240
I can't.
I can't shut the fuck up too much

And uh,

2779
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:31,920
we're going to come back with a cameron
hanes podcast at.

2780
02:08:31,921 --> 02:08:34,450
Won't be on Youtube.
Maybe he'll eventually get it set up

2781
02:08:34,451 --> 02:08:36,880
where it's going to be on youtube,
but I'll tweet it,

2782
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:38,920
he'll tweet it,
will put it on facebook and everything

2783
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:41,050
like that.
And you'll be able to download that

2784
