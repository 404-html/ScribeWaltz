1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,661
Do Do,
do,

2
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:02,670
do,
and four,

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,730
three to spillover fell out.
What's going on?

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,470
See Ya.
Good to see you too.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,300
Thank you very much for taking me up on 
that flight.

6
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:13,134
I'm gonna.
Tell you what legitimately you changed 

7
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,390
the way I think about La.
It's really small,

8
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,370
isn't it?
It's way smaller than you think.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,740
It's a different thing when you fly over
it.

10
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:24,450
You Go,
oh,

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,740
this ain't that big.
Yeah,

12
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,570
that's here.
This is the cause what it is.

13
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,130
I remember when I was still getting my 
license and I was doing a night flight.

14
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,810
Right?
Which is insane.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,610
Totally different ballgame.
Imagine.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,720
And uh,

17
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,770
yeah,
because when you're on the ground you're

18
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,011
like,
wow,

19
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,500
it'd be really easy to see everybody 
because you're looking up and all you've

20
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,820
seen is the backdrop of the dark sky.
Right?

21
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:44,160
Right.
But when you get up there,

22
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,430
if someone's below you,
they disappeared into the city.

23
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,680
So that's what.
Yeah,

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,140
yeah,
yeah,

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,661
yeah.
So anyway,

26
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:52,290
so we were flying back and I trained 
down in Long Beach,

27
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,140
so we were going along the seven,
10 and I just see like all these,

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,450
these lights and it was like,
right?

29
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,730
Them like going up and I go,
what's that?

30
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,010
He goes,
I got a pilot over.

31
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:02,341
He goes,
oh,

32
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,520
that's the uh,
that's the fireworks from Disneyland.

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,073
And I was like,
fucking Disneyland is right there 

34
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,220
because in my head it took like two 
hours to get there,

35
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,390
hour and a half going down the five.
But it's just like,

36
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,293
because you don't look at miles,
all you do is look at time when you're 

37
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,860
out here because there's so much 
traffic.

38
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,600
But it's literally like,
oh,

39
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,450
that's like 40 miles.
It's not even.

40
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,333
It's like from Hollywood,
like I would think it can even be more 

41
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,250
than 15,
20 miles away.

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,470
Like Anaheim.
He's so fucking close.

43
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,320
But I just,
it's just like Irvine Comedy Club,

44
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,440
that's all I think of it.
Just fucking way to fuck down there.

45
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,693
And then you get up in a helicopter and 
you're like there and like 11 minutes 

46
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,310
going like this.
This is ridiculous.

47
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,320
So,
um,

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,940
yeah,
yeah,

49
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,100
that's awesome dude.
It was awesome.

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,113
Yeah,
it was a Malibu when you landed on top 

51
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:53,960
of that little hill there with a picnic 
table.

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,780
Dude sat it down.
Nice.

53
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:57,561
I was a little nervous.
I'm like,

54
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:58,220
all right,
don't,

55
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,860
don't fuck this up with joe here because
he's going to be like Ed Burger.

56
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,960
No,
it's all right.

57
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,803
When he was flying,
when he was the big part when you went 

58
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,050
to land,
he wasn't that good,

59
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,180
but I was smooth and then the apocalypse
now.

60
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,530
Shit,
we're going through the canyons.

61
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,230
John.
That was awesome man.

62
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,560
That was so I get it.
That was a fun.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,740
It's a uh,
it's a lot of fun in the,

64
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:18,574
you know,
I fly mostly with an instructor because 

65
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:20,684
I got the kit and everything,
but every once in a while you got to go 

66
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,990
out by yourself just so you know,
you can do it.

67
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,850
But um,
I also,

68
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,210
um,
I'm actually over to overdue to do it,

69
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,044
but I always go out and I do like the 
auto rotations and he'll just sort of 

70
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,170
chat on flying along.
He'll just chop throttle and like,

71
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,690
it's just,
it's just rolling the Rpms.

72
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,370
I mean rolling the engine down at the 
Rpm,

73
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,310
the engine down and then you immediately
have to pick a spot,

74
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,140
you know,
when sometimes you know,

75
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,380
the lower you are,
you know,

76
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,130
it becomes literally what you,
the first place you look is where you're

77
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,330
putting it.
It's really crazy.

78
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:49,060
But um,
where you would,

79
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,810
where you would point what you're 
talking about.

80
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:51,644
You mean crash landing,
that's an auto rotation means it'd be 

81
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:57,260
basically if you had some sort of 
failure problem,

82
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,340
your engine failure,
whatever.

83
00:02:58,341 --> 00:02:59,980
So like when you're flying along in

84
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
the engine's working,
it's drawing air into the disc and 

85
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,450
that's what creates lift.
But when,

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
uh,
when you go into an auto rotation,

87
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,940
um,
it's,

88
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,840
it's the air rushing.
You're using gravity,

89
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,970
bringing the,
uh,

90
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:15,340
the helicopter down,
using that air,

91
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,010
like almost like a fan to keep it going.
So,

92
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,910
and there's a critical point where if 
you let the main rotor go too slow,

93
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,180
that's why the low rpm horn comes on,
which is just a nausea and sound.

94
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,013
If you let it go too low,
that when it gets to a point where if 

95
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,100
it's spinning too slowly,
no matter how fast you drop,

96
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:33,934
you can't get it going again,
fast enough to create and you're 

97
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,234
basically at that point,
you're in something that's no longer 

98
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,620
able to fly your,
uh,

99
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,190
your instructor,
skylar,

100
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,450
skylar a pointed out something that I 
didn't know that they have to Redo those

101
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:47,140
things.

102
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,300
Like every x amount of miles,
they rebuild every hours.

103
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,930
Yeah,
yeah.

104
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,641
It's a,
well,

105
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,474
they have like,
there's all this maintenance along the 

106
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,604
way.
They're incredibly maintained because 

107
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,720
I'm sure you noticed if you read the 
comments,

108
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,240
all people talk about is dying and 
aviation.

109
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,140
It's like,
oh,

110
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,060
that's how entertainers die.
It's like,

111
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:04,541
no,
it isn't.

112
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,374
They overdose.
If you really looked at the graph there 

113
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:08,554
on the ground,
completely safe overdose car accidents 

114
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,480
always overdose ranking.
Yeah.

115
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,180
And Shit like that.
And it's just like,

116
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,043
that's mainly how you die.
Like the amount of people that are up 

117
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,810
there every day and then nothing 
happens.

118
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,800
It's,
it's,

119
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,060
you know,
but there is the,

120
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:25,720
you know,
the,

121
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,553
the fly in the ointment is that this,
there are particularly at the private 

122
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,144
level,
there are knuckleheads out there like 

123
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,754
this.
People like I think every time I get in 

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,260
I'm always thinking like,
am I gonna you know,

125
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,070
I don't want to die today.

126
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,900
So I,
I,

127
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,510
I go over all of the,
a whole bunch of shit and you know,

128
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,300
especially if I'm going to fly solo,
I have the whole flight,

129
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:50,230
I have all my options on,
you know,

130
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,480
where I could land,
you know,

131
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,700
if I had a problem,
like that's what you're supposed to do.

132
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,130
I look at weather reports,
I do all of that shit.

133
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,233
And what happens is guys get more and 
more confident and their preflight is a 

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,350
kind of look,
oh,

135
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,010
it looks pretty clear.
And then they go out there and uh,

136
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,031
you know,
this,

137
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:07,770
you know,
this,

138
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,603
this,
there's people who go up knowing that 

139
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:10,894
they can die.
And then there's other people out there 

140
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,130
who just like magnum Pi and they want to
fly by waterfalls and shit.

141
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:19,570
I mean those guys have more fun.
But it's,

142
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
you know,
there's definitely,

143
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:21,994
um,
those are the people that you're 

144
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,850
supposed to fly.

145
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,683
There's like two envelopes.
You supposed to fly within the envelope 

146
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:27,994
of what you're flying and then you know,
your skill set so you don't fly into 

147
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,090
shit this like,
you know,

148
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,080
like if,
if it's too windy or whatever,

149
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,690
I'm just saying I'm not going.
Even if I could handle it,

150
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,910
it's like I'm not going to have fun up 
there fucking,

151
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:41,320
you know,
riding it out and just,

152
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,154
you know,
let the wind do what it wants to do and 

153
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:44,680
don't fight it.
And you know,

154
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,514
make sure,
you know,

155
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,950
you're not flying to fail.
You do is slow down,

156
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,020
you know.
Um,

157
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,440
but you know,
it's there,

158
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,283
there are elements of that.
But like if you look up there versus 

159
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:58,160
what's going on down below when fly,
I always say this,

160
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,740
when you drive on the highway,
it's like you're flying in formation,

161
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,010
you're in the blue angels with a Bun 
with nobody talking to anybody.

162
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,750
You have no idea what anybody's going to
do.

163
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,480
People are texting,
they're on medication,

164
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,710
they're fucking hung over their 
suicidal.

165
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,870
What the fuck they're doing,
you know,

166
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,733
and then the Saturday you've got to look
out for the guy splitting lanes and the 

167
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,164
motorcycles and shit.
It's pretty amazing how few accidents 

168
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,940
are actually are there.
It is,

169
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,800
it is.
And what I fly the Robinson,

170
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,693
they get a bad rep saying they're not 
safe because they look at the amount of 

171
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:27,090
crashes that they've had.
But it,

172
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,933
it's,
it's because it's a helicopter you can 

173
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:30,734
afford.
So it's inherently a low our pilot and 

174
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,580
if you look at it,
it's,

175
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:37,680
most of the time it's not,
it's not the,

176
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,590
the helicopter,
it's the,

177
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,390
it's the person flying it,
which is why you really have to be on it

178
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,690
like you,
you can't.

179
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,470
Um,
it's,

180
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,930
it's just not something,
uh,

181
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,010
uh,
uh,

182
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,930
I don't know how to explain it.

183
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,920
It's this weird thing where your level 
of enjoyment is way higher if you're,

184
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,080
if you're riding in it,
you know what I mean?

185
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,910
If you're the person flying the whole 
time,

186
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:01,640
you have your life and other people's 
lives enhance so that you're not really,

187
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,623
oh,
look at that.

188
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,411
Oh,
look at that.

189
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,140
I'll get that.
Yeah.

190
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,060
So like,
you know,

191
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,870
thinking things of like,
you know,

192
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,630
when we were flying through that Canyon 
Unit,

193
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,400
you've done that.
I think in that shit.

194
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm looking,
you know,

195
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:17,120
no one where the wires are and where the
road is because that's all fucking tree.

196
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,180
So it's going to be the road.
So there's those,

197
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,140
you know,
when you're kind of going around a bend,

198
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,974
you know,
this certain altitudes and stuff just 

199
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,400
it's,
it's boring,

200
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:28,930
but it's just stuff that you're always 
thinking that um,

201
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,470
you know,
I imagine like when you fight this,

202
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:32,241
that,
you know,

203
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,890
I know with a lot of it's like instinct 
and stuff,

204
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,510
but this,
these things that you just don't.

205
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,900
Do you know what I mean?
I don't know anything about finding.

206
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,743
I was her in boxing.
You don't lead with an upper cut that 

207
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,170
just,
it's just fucking things you don't think

208
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,850
you see.
A lot of guys when they go to take off,

209
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:46,220
they do this fucking thing.
Like the nose down attitude.

210
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,880
Like I was taught not to do that because
they do that because it looks cool.

211
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
I don't know why they do it.
I mean,

212
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,030
you're supposed to,
like I was taught,

213
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:56,900
you're supposed to keep it level so that
way if you have a problem,

214
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,140
you know,
you,

215
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,330
you're already in the right attitude to 
just immediately enter,

216
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,223
enter an auto.
Like now if I'm fucking nose down and 

217
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:07,340
from too far to the ground,
I'm just gonna fucking go right into the

218
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,840
ground.
Um,

219
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,793
I dunno,
but I mean I'm still like totally a 

220
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:11,650
novice.

221
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,730
I'm coming up on 200 hours so I don't 
know a lot,

222
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:14,870
but I'm super,
super,

223
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,480
super,
super fucking cautious.

224
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,700
And uh,
I,

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,370
I make sure I don't go too long without 
doing auto rotations.

226
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,280
I used to hate them and now I actually 
really liked them.

227
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,613
Um,
it was sort of the way it was explained 

228
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,500
to me.
I didn't get it until one day.

229
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,334
I just thought about it and then I got 
it and I was able to lock into it 

230
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:34,694
because it's,
it's the same inputs if you were going 

231
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,674
in for a landing,
but they broke it down to like four 

232
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:41,420
steps.
Like it was low Rpm,

233
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:41,961
you know,
lower,

234
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:44,360
collective,
gentle aft cyclic,

235
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,490
you know,
a look at your trim strings,

236
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,430
you know?
Yeah.

237
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,610
Was a trim,
trim,

238
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,110
airspeed,
Rpms,

239
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:53,800
and just fucking doing all of this.
And the reality is,

240
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,070
is just like it's the right pedal.

241
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,630
Jesus Christ,
I forgot that right pedal.

242
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,553
So it's all the same.
It's all the same input if you were 

243
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,300
going in for a landing.
So all I do,

244
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,134
anytime I hear the low rpm is I just do 
that and then I'm locked into it and 

245
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,070
then I'm just watching my.
Then I can just watch my rpms.

246
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,570
And at this point I've flown enough 
where I kind of know where I'm in trim,

247
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,240
which basically means you're not like 
crabbing and you kind of go and straight

248
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,120
and then he can kind of like pick out 
your spot and then it becomes fun.

249
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,250
And what's cool is you can do like one 
80 autos.

250
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,084
You can turn around.
And what I do like about it is when you 

251
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,640
come down to the ground and you can 
bleed off all of your airspeed,

252
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,730
that forward motion that's going to 
fucking kill you.

253
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,923
And as long as you don't fuck up and 
flare and go back up and then drop like 

254
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:34,164
a,
you know,

255
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,063
you know,
it's Kinda like a hockey stop was the 

256
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,430
way it was described to me.
Just level it out and running shoe going

257
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,080
to drop.
You pull like that.

258
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,000
And these guys land.
I'm like daisies and stuff.

259
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,260
It's,
it's really amazing.

260
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,930
I'm not as good as that.
But like I,

261
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,680
I will do it where,
you know,

262
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,510
worst case scenario,
you know,

263
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,700
I might like,
oh fuck,

264
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,200
like get a little bit of a bump.
Yeah.

265
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,850
But I'm going to be all right.
So,

266
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,530
um,
yeah,

267
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,453
I don't know.
Now there's probably a bunch of people 

268
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,620
saying I don't know what the fuck I'm 
talking about,

269
00:09:58,621 --> 00:09:59,454
which admittedly,
you know,

270
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,800
I still think there's a lot of shit I 
need to learn about standup.

271
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,050
So as long as you go into things like 
that,

272
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,110
um,
you know,

273
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,453
well,
the fact that you're doing it and the 

274
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:11,360
fact that you learn in a new thing 
that's really difficult to learn,

275
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,520
don't you think that that's good for 
your brain?

276
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,230
Now I am a big believer in constantly 
learning.

277
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:21,950
It's why I like you as a person cause 
you're constantly,

278
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,760
like you're not the Joe I knew three 
years ago in a good way.

279
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,650
You're like,
you learn all of this.

280
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,120
You know,
I first met you.

281
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,250
You weren't hunting,
uh,

282
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,830
you were a marsh.
That was the,

283
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,550
you a two dimensional,
you will,

284
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,380
which was amazing because everyone was 
just a community.

285
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:39,980
You will this taekwondo champion,
a stand up guy.

286
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,443
And then,
and then since then you've added all 

287
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,884
like the guests that you have on and the
fact that you're able to like talk to 

288
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,620
them and stuff is because you've 
continued to,

289
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,300
you know,
um,

290
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,511
you know,
it's,

291
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,344
it's the same thing with like a comic 
who writes his first hour and then just 

292
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,124
sits on it for like eight years and all 
of a sudden two presidents goes by and 

293
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,120
it's like,
why aren't they laughing anymore?

294
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:00,950
It's like because you're just stuck in 
time.

295
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,410
So,
um,

296
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,201
I,
I,

297
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:03,990
yeah,
I believe in that.

298
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,830
I also believe in

299
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,103
cards,
card games and stuff is good for your 

300
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,460
end in any games they say in video 
games,

301
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,050
you know,
people like the shit on video games,

302
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:16,160
but they say video games have a positive
cognitive effect on kids.

303
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,900
Yeah.
That's calculating and move it.

304
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,220
You're thinking fast.
Yeah,

305
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,840
they're hand eye coordination is like 
insane.

306
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,750
I guess if some of those games,
if you play them,

307
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:24,584
I guess,
I don't know.

308
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,010
Well you think about the amount of hours
they're putting into their thumbs.

309
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,790
Just how often do you really use your 
thumb and like detailed ways.

310
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,653
Very rarely,
but kids didn't have ridiculous thumb 

311
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,650
dexterity.
I tapped out a grand theft auto three is

312
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,450
when I stopped,
which was about 2003,

313
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,790
2002 or something.
I just,

314
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,090
they were just too amazing.
And ours just like,

315
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:47,290
like

316
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,590
I am nowhere in my career right now.
And this is just dude.

317
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:53,590
I was walking around was living in New 
York at the time and I would playing the

318
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:57,970
game and I would be walking down the 
street thinking about it like what?

319
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,860
I walked into the subway,
you know,

320
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,753
like not thinking about jokes,
thinking how I could beat this next 

321
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,390
level.
I remember I played this,

322
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,460
um,
metal of honor game and uh,

323
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,790
they had this thing when you hit the 
sniper button,

324
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,250
like the scope would go like that and x 
would go like that.

325
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:13,084
And I,
and I played at one day or one week so 

326
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,660
much that when I walked out on the 
street,

327
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:20,160
I was looking at people cross the street
to unlike that at x on my face.

328
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,350
I was just like something about like,
I already,

329
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,600
uh,
I'm not the brightest guy.

330
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,370
You know,
when it comes to like school and shit,

331
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,980
so it's just like I was like,
this is doing something to my brain,

332
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:30,814
so I kind of,
I remember I came home and I just 

333
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:36,370
unplugged everything but really quickly 
took everything off because I knew I was

334
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,650
never going to figure it out and I 
didn't have any instructions anymore.

335
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,730
I just stuck it in the back of the like,
well that's it.

336
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,710
I did the same thing with video games 
with quake.

337
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,653
I,
I had a real problem when I was playing 

338
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,393
eight hours a day,
10 hours a day sometimes I had a t one 

339
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:52,424
line installed in my house just so I 
could play with a faster Internet 

340
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,200
connection.
This is like 1998.

341
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,640
Yeah,
it was crazy.

342
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,950
I mean there was slow Internet where I 
was so I said,

343
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:01,784
well what's the options?
And so one option is they chew up the 

344
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:06,200
street and put this fucking crazy fat 
business line.

345
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,540
Cost me a shit load of money.
And I was like,

346
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,374
let's do it out of fucking business line
that we use at the time you'd use for a 

347
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,134
large building.
And I had it just for my house and I 

348
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,780
would play video games online all the 
time.

349
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,560
And you can play online against people 
for the last 20 years.

350
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,850
Oh yeah.
I didn't know that.

351
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,743
We play online teams.
We'd have teams of guys like me and 

352
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:30,674
three of my friends would play against 
four other guys and we'd meet at a 

353
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,250
certain server and you know,
you could chat and talk to each other.

354
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,150
All right,
you ready to go?

355
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:38,671
Alright,
let's go.

356
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:39,111
And three,
two,

357
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:42,350
one go.
And then the game will start and then we

358
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,990
have these matches.
And it was fun,

359
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,100
man.
It was really fun.

360
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,160
It was really exciting too because it's 
all happening in real time.

361
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,170
But uh,
I reached a point,

362
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,663
uh,
somewhere around like the year 2000 

363
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,990
where I know one day I played until it 
was sunlight until the sun came up.

364
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,140
And you know,
I'm fucking 30 years old and I'm sitting

365
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:04,310
there.
My hands are sweating.

366
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,313
I'm all fucking caffeinated up.
I've been drinking a mountain dew for 

367
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:10,340
the past eight hours.

368
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,361
And I realized,
I'm like,

369
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:13,820
what am I doing like this,
you know,

370
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:18,170
I'm not where I want to be as a comic,
I'm not where I want to be with my life.

371
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,273
And uh,
I'm just sitting here playing video 

372
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,670
games all the time and there's no future
in this.

373
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,080
I've been stuck in things where there's 
no future before I know what that is.

374
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,440
I felt like that with fighting,
I was when I was 21,

375
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:31,910
there was a point in time where I was 
like,

376
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,103
there's no future in this.
Like I'm just going to keep getting hit 

377
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:38,210
in the head and I'm going to get dumber 
and more brain damage and more crazy.

378
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,860
And I'm like,
this is dangerous.

379
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,750
And I realized I'm,
I gotta stop.

380
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,430
I gotta stop.
There's no future in this.

381
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,230
There was no money in fighting back then
either.

382
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,660
And then I got there with pool.
Same thing with pool.

383
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:49,790
Like my manager called me up and he 
said,

384
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,310
I think you play pool too much.

385
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,570
He's like,
he's like,

386
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:00,290
I think that you seriously think about 
pool more than you do your career.

387
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,133
And uh,
I respect him and he's a very good 

388
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,290
friend of mine,
so I had a really,

389
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,520
really poor.
I didn't,

390
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,050
you know,
I didn't take it lightly.

391
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,030
I had to take a deep breath and I was 
like,

392
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,864
fuck.
He's right.

393
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,430
He's right.
I played pool all the time.

394
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,860
It was playing every day.
I have a,

395
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,560
I have a real addictive personnel too.
I do too.

396
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,310
So I get like a,
like how many hours I want to get flying

397
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,233
and then like a things I want to learn,
playing drums and stuff and then it 

398
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:24,161
becomes,
I,

399
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,930
I've had to learn to be like built.
These are hobbies.

400
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,813
Yes,
yes.

401
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,810
Dad First.
And you're a comedian.

402
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,723
Let's sort of priority.
Like the world isn't waiting for you to 

403
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,710
know how to play good times,
bad times.

404
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,300
That can sit back a little bit.
But the fact that you're doing that kind

405
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,520
of stuff I think is great.
I love it.

406
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,383
I really identify with you and a lot of 
ways when you do that well you get 

407
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,240
fucking crazy about drums.
Are you going crazy bro?

408
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,843
Everything.
I just.

409
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,240
Can I just,
I go down,

410
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:56,230
like I got to learn all about,
like everything came out here.

411
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:58,810
I got into old cars and then all of a 
sudden I was watching this guy,

412
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,860
Eric,
the car guy.

413
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,700
I found him most fascinating because he 
would work on like cars of today.

414
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,223
Will you just open the hood?
It's like what is everything and where 

415
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:11,770
the hotter you get it and he's just 
taken off all this plastic shit and just

416
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,660
dig in all the way down and he's just 
like,

417
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:14,494
you know,
if you can't remember just video tape 

418
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,110
it.
Just remember how it all goes together.

419
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,393
Dude.
One time I forget what the hell he was 

420
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:19,984
changing,
but he had to take the whole front end 

421
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:25,770
of this car off to change something that
I used to be able to change on,

422
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,880
like my fucking 83 Ford Ranger.

423
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,650
I know that guy.
I know what you're talking about.

424
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,380
Yeah,
yeah.

425
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,670
It's in,
it's like he does every electrical.

426
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:36,700
He doesn't fucking everything and I 
would just sit there.

427
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,983
I watched all of that.
I watched all the way back to people 

428
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:40,684
rebuilding like Flathead v eight s and 
what made it a flathead and I never got 

429
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:46,510
any electrical that always seemed like 
magic to me.

430
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:49,570
Like I never got into that shit.
I was scared like,

431
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:50,404
Oh,
you touch it and you get fucking 

432
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:55,210
electrocuted.
But I got all into like watching like,

433
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,030
like somebody rebuild an engine,
like just from the bottom to the top.

434
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,630
And that just wasn't a lot of stuff,
right?

435
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,753
It was like the crank shaft and then 
there was the shit that held on the 

436
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:06,664
Pistons.
You put the drop to Pistons in and that 

437
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,030
the.
Then there was the intake,

438
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,970
the intake manifold and then the other 
was the um,

439
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,260
uh,
the big thing,

440
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:17,170
the valves gapping the valves that 
seemed like our man,

441
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,360
if you fuck that up,
this thing isn't going to run right.

442
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,870
And um,
and just knowing that the firing thing.

443
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,883
And I got into like Torque wrenches and 
I learned how to change brakes on like 

444
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,330
a,
a,

445
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,640
like old school,
like shoe breaks and stuff like that.

446
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:32,080
I got all the right wrenches and all 
that.

447
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,910
Um,
I don't know how to adjust them.

448
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:34,744
I know where you do this,
this little slit in the back of the 

449
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:38,500
wheel and I thought you just put them 
close to it.

450
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,650
It's right up against the drum.
You supposed to put them on.

451
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:44,140
And I got totally into fucking breaks 
for awhile.

452
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,843
I tried to rebuild the carburetor,
failed miserably because it was really 

453
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,580
old and I took off too parts.
It was like warped and shit.

454
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:52,860
So was that your dodge?
The truck now?

455
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:53,740
Ford.
Ford,

456
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,950
yeah.
Ford a black.

457
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,731
It's black.
Yeah.

458
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:57,100
Yeah,
yeah.

459
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,370
The thing was brown.
I don't know what years.

460
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,300
Alex.
60,

461
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,310
68.
It was made.

462
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,000
I looked up the vin number.
It was actually made in Canada.

463
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,880
Crazy.
March of [inaudible].

464
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:08,714
Sixty eight,
I want to say Toronto or something like 

465
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,261
that.
Like they,

466
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,340
I guess they had a,
a,

467
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,310
a factory up there or whatever.
So in March of 19,

468
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,144
68,
that thing rolled off and I think it 

469
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:18,540
spent most of its life down south,
like in Georgia.

470
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,670
And you swap the breaks off or 
dyspraxia?

471
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,530
I did a,
I,

472
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,250
Chris Titus was the one who helped me 
with that.

473
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,780
Uh,
he put a,

474
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,930
I did one side,
he did the other,

475
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,953
he did the other,
but he showed me I was just doing what 

476
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:35,400
he told me to do,
so I had all drum brakes and I wanted to

477
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:38,340
keep it all original,
but you know,

478
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:42,300
people were pulling out in front of me 
like I had disc brakes and I'll tell you

479
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,950
what,
it's fucking hilarious.

480
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,083
When I only had drum breaks,
I locked him up one time in front of a 

481
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:52,690
bunch of millennials and they've never 
heard that sound fucking.

482
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,600
And they all,
they all went like that.

483
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,770
And all I was doing,
I just,

484
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,390
you know,
the light turned yellow fast.

485
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,150
Yellow lights are out here.
I was kind of an east coast mindset like

486
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:00,901
I can make this.
No,

487
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,100
I can't.
And I just fucking.

488
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,993
I didn't even think I hit him that hard.
I kind of went a little sideways and 

489
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:08,490
then it was fucking hilarious.
It's like this outdoor cafe and they all

490
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,950
looked over and then I just had to 
fucking sit there.

491
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,620
It was almost like that already lang 
movie,

492
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:14,454
when he fucking moon,
he moves the crowd and the guy gets out 

493
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:17,760
and just leaves him there.
He's like,

494
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,370
oh,
he was.

495
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,203
He was supposed to keep going.
That's what I felt like I was actually 

496
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,420
embarrassed.
I'd probably waved and said sorry.

497
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,660
Those breaks are terrible.
It's amazing.

498
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:27,494
Nobody died or more people didn't die.
Rather those bricks are used to have a 

499
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,260
1970 barracuda that,
those kinds of breaks.

500
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,333
Oh yeah.
No,

501
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,323
just was 71 when I was in high school 
and you'd hit the brakes and it would 

502
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,270
just skid.
I mean,

503
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:44,180
there was everything locked up inside 
lock breaks.

504
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:45,780
One of the greatest inventions.
Ms.

505
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,420
fucking incredible invention.

506
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,743
No,
I used to drive my truck before I had 

507
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:50,934
power steering.
I've got put power steering in an air 

508
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:53,214
conditioning.
It was just basically a farm truck and 

509
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,430
it was like no power steering three on 
the column,

510
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,930
which I still have because I think 
that's cool.

511
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,333
And I used,
I got stuck in the teeth of the one 

512
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:05,640
night,
like the fucking,

513
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,493
uh,
you know,

514
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,660
traffic always say it stuck driving 
through the teeth of it.

515
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,563
It'd be like between five and seven,
I was coming from Santa Monica driving 

516
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:16,680
over to the fucking laugh factory.
And I literally,

517
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,050
by the time I got to the laugh factory,
I was tired.

518
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,820
Man.
I know I'm an older guy,

519
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,130
but just like shifting and like,
you know,

520
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,993
like when you,
when you're at a dead stop and you just 

521
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:26,634
turning the fucking wave of that and 
it's this giant steering wheel to give 

522
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:31,620
you like leverage.
That's why the fucking thing is so big.

523
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,020
And I was just like,
oh my God,

524
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:34,620
like I,
you know,

525
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,453
do an,
a three point turn in that like my 

526
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,910
triceps would be burning.
Not In the best shape,

527
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,990
but I'm just saying it's like I got to 
make my life a little easier.

528
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,680
My little

529
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,513
car,
that little red car that I have that 

530
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,220
doesn't have any power steering.
And when I,

531
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:48,850
when I turned thing,
that car is so light and tiny,

532
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:49,684
it's fucking hard to turn though.
Like when I have to pull into the 

533
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:52,294
parking lot at the comedy store and I 
have to back it up so that I could get 

534
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:55,280
out of there quick.
Yeah.

535
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,283
It's a pain in the Dick.
Three point turns are not three point 

536
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:00,520
turns.
So like four or five points.

537
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,350
Yeah.
I wonder if back in the day,

538
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,180
because those,
those original cars,

539
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,130
they had those little skinny bike tires 
on it.

540
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:06,964
It was,
it was just easier to turn in as they 

541
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:11,170
got like heavier and wider.

542
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,621
Well,
you know,

543
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:14,200
my corvette has that modern suspension 
on it,

544
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,690
that 65 corvette and it has really wide 
tires,

545
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:19,450
like the big old steam rollers.
Just for a goof.

546
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,670
I had the power steering taken off.
I'm like,

547
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,410
let's see what it's like to have the 
power steering.

548
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,370
It's fucking horrible.
It was horrible.

549
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,210
You'd get a forum workout just driving 
around

550
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,020
driving on the street.
Yeah.

551
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,680
You're bouncing around.
It was too much

552
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,450
and change it back.
Yeah.

553
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,593
I love old cars though.
There's something about the idea that 

554
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:38,204
you could fix it.
You could go in there and with a good 

555
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:42,380
book or a good video,
you can actually fix it,

556
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,300
you know,
I know a lot of guys will fix things.

557
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:45,980
I know guys who have changed their 
transmission,

558
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,980
they've gone in there and swap their 
transmission now for a new one

559
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,460
balls to take it apart.
And then the patient's like,

560
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,483
I know you gotta ask for help.
And like I just found like it was just 

561
00:21:59,191 --> 00:21:59,880
like,
and like,

562
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,350
ah,
I need what tool?

563
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:03,820
I don't have that fucking tool.
Then you have to order it.

564
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:06,660
It was really frustrating.
And um,

565
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,530
that was a quick sort of like rabbit 
hole I went down.

566
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,364
So I like,
now that I kind of understand how the 

567
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:14,330
whole thing comes together.
Um,

568
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,383
but like,
yeah,

569
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,340
I guess that gets back to the whole,
uh,

570
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,203
going down the rabbit hole,

571
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,063
there's a guy who's got a great video 
that you would love and it's on 

572
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,350
petrolicious and it's the video called,
I think it's called a car,

573
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,580
one car for everything.
And is this guy,

574
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,180
he's a fiction writer,
writes screenplays and shit.

575
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,660
Never worked on a car in his life.
Decided you want to buy an old porsche,

576
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,690
so he bought like a 1971 porsche and 
didn't know Jack Shit about cars,

577
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,630
so he starts learning one called car to 
do it all.

578
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:48,464
That's it.
So this guy puts together this car and 

579
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:53,864
then starts working on it and then takes
his fucking garage and turns his garage 

580
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:01,370
until like a professional workspace,
digs a hole in the ground,

581
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:04,370
puts a lift in,
in the floor of his garage,

582
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,930
like blaze cement does everything.
This guy married A.

583
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:09,764
I don't know,
it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem 

584
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:16,240
like.
But he's got that old car.

585
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,380
This is the car.
A beautiful car.

586
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:20,300
Look at that thing.
I'd love those.

587
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:21,320
Oh and that's,
you know,

588
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,180
my

589
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,960
71,
it looks like in 19,

590
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,330
late seventies to me.

591
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,363
No,
it's a flat.

592
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,040
No flat hood.
The long hood rather.

593
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,510
The long hood models are like 68,
67,

594
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:36,090
68 to [inaudible] 73.
That's the name Jack Olson.

595
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,403
It's a really fucking cool video because
this is a guy that didn't have any 

596
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:41,880
background in it.
That's his fucking garage.

597
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:42,714
He built all this.
He built the whole garage and he 

598
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,760
decided,
look,

599
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:50,330
I just slowly get into it and understand
it and he has different Arrow,

600
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,164
like see that giant wing that's Arrow 
that he puts on only when he's at the 

601
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,550
race track so we can unbolt it and do 
it.

602
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,150
He uses his car for everything.
He uses his car to go get groceries.

603
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,400
That looks like fucking beautiful car.
Those cars are so light to that car.

604
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,400
Cars like 2010.
He flared out the fenders though,

605
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,270
right?
No,

606
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,193
no.
The RSR from that era had flared 

607
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,023
fenders.
Yeah.

608
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,290
Wow.
Yeah.

609
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,124
Well they had to have fat rear fenders 
and fat rear tires because the engine's 

610
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:23,654
in the back and those things snap around
when you take in turns because the 

611
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:27,764
balance is way off.
Like the engine is hanging out behind 

612
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:33,080
the rear wheels.
It's not a mid engine car.

613
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,390
It's a rear engine car,
which is extremely rare,

614
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,410
like only porsche really does it and so 
you get something called lift,

615
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,550
throttle,
oversteer.

616
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:43,460
When you're in a turn,
you have to keep the pedal on.

617
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,920
You have to keep the gas going.
When you're in a turn,

618
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,783
if you let off the turn,
your rear end just pops out and you get 

619
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:52,640
oversteer you'll spin around in a 
circle.

620
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,990
So they used to call the turbos widow 
makers because the way they used to have

621
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:57,824
those old cars,
they used to have those really shitty 

622
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,244
tires like that.
Like he's got new modern compound tires 

623
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,630
on that thing,
so it probably sticks like glue,

624
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,780
but the old tires were dog shit.
They were terrible.

625
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,090
So you'd have this super powerful 
engine,

626
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,320
the weird dynamics where the engine's 
hanging out behind the axle.

627
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,300
I never thought about that.
Yeah.

628
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,760
So much fun to drive.
There's so much fun to drive.

629
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,790
So engaging.
I love taking it to the store because by

630
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,310
the time I get to the store,
like my brain's firing,

631
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,790
it's like pop in because I've been 
shifted and it's all mechanical.

632
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,420
It's air cooled,
you know,

633
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,583
and it's not a very.
Like that red car is not a very fast 

634
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,910
car.
Like a modern car.

635
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:38,510
Like a tesla is way faster than it is,
but it's what it is,

636
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:41,150
is a lie.
It's like you feel the gears,

637
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,690
like when you shifted,
put that sucker in a second.

638
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,550
It's very visceral,
you know?

639
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,110
Yeah.

640
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,140
I drove a buddy's tesla one time.
That was fucking ridiculous.

641
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,750
It fast.
Yeah.

642
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,380
No,
my head was Tanglin,

643
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,214
like I said,
blood rushing to the back and he just 

644
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:03,650
had the one motor and every guy I know 
that has a tesla,

645
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,000
the handful,
a handful I should say.

646
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,820
Uh,
they all got invited to the factory when

647
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:08,654
they got the motor on the front wheel 
and the back wheel and all of them said 

648
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:12,680
no to that car going,
dude,

649
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:13,514
I would fucking die if I got that.
It was like almost like super bike 

650
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,470
motorcycle fast.
Like a,

651
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,260
like a,
like a racing motorcycle level fast.

652
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,590
It's zero to 60 in like two point 
something seconds.

653
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,350
And then they have that new one,
that roadster that's coming out.

654
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,270
That's one point.
Something seconds.

655
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,150
One point something seconds.
Zero to 60.

656
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,071
Yeah.
You're,

657
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:36,240
you're in a missile.
I,

658
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,790
it's the only way to put it.

659
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,330
Like God forbid somebody's foot slips 
off the brake onto the gas.

660
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,000
You're going to obliterate a street full
of people and that's fucking crazy.

661
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,050
It is crazy.
It's bad enough.

662
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,893
Somebody does that on a bike.
You can do that on a car with all that 

663
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:51,330
weight and those tassels.
I heavy as shit because of that battery,

664
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:52,200
I guess.
Which I didn't really.

665
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,260
I think I would think because there was 
no power train or anything that it would

666
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,094
be lighter,
but I guess that is like super heavy 

667
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,600
shit and they don't make any noise,
which is even weirder.

668
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:02,100
So they're coming at you.
You don't even know.

669
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,720
Yeah,
they're kind of lost and I don't know.

670
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,850
I don't like the front end.
There's no grilling.

671
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,610
The front end's boring.
It is kind of boring.

672
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,473
Kind of boring.
Like the new one isn't the roadster 

673
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,690
roadster that pull up the.

674
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,540
Can I promote that?
That roadster.

675
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,870
Can I promote the portrays thing?
Fuck you.

676
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,820
Uh,
what,

677
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,660
what do we to February 19th.
The.

678
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,600
What would this look at?
This eighth annual Tesla's new emissions

679
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,050
testing mode will produce loud nasty 
farts on demand.

680
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,240
It makes fart.
Added a fart app this week.

681
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,620
Oh,
that's so ridiculous.

682
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,140
It's got seven different parts or six 
different fart sounds,

683
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:34,974
and then one automatic.
You can set it to like different 

684
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:37,500
buttons,
turn signal,

685
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:41,760
and so it makes sounds and it makes 
smell to no smell.

686
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,130
It's just the sound emissions.
Oh,

687
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:44,880
okay.
Okay.

688
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,580
That's just stupid.
Anyways,

689
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:48,414
to patrice o'neal Fart.
When is the February 19th at the New 

690
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,990
York City Center.
And uh,

691
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,640
what do we got here?
I shut off my damn phone.

692
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,440
We got um,
Michelle Wolf.

693
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:00,330
Michelle Wolf.
Jim Gaffigan.

694
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,970
Uh,
I got it here.

695
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,410
Had I already forget.
I'm SIFA sounds myself.

696
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,750
Rich Vos.
It's all coming back here.

697
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,490
Big J.
Big Jay Oakerson.

698
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,810
Gary Goldman.
Chris read a.

699
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,703
that's a fucking hell of a line.
We're going to try to add a couple more 

700
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:20,080
people to it.
It's at the New York City Center.

701
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,690
Tuesday,
February 19th.

702
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,833
Uh,
all proceeds go to his family and it's 

703
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,650
been such a great thing like his,
um,

704
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,493
his mom's been able to get a condo and 
everything just total because he was 

705
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,173
taking.
We basically with that thing we take 

706
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,200
care of everybody that he was taking 
care of.

707
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,133
[inaudible] believe the mission was 
basically all his family should have to 

708
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,230
deal with is the grief Brent,
you know,

709
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,083
I always think that that's enough.
And the reason why we continue to do 

710
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:46,020
whatever year is because his family 
members are still,

711
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,370
you know,
alive.

712
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,170
And I always hated that when somebody 
died and says,

713
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,460
hey,
we do one time,

714
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,840
it was a sack of money trying to make 
this last for the next 30 to 60 years of

715
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:55,674
our lives,
you know.

716
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,870
And uh,
and then also because,

717
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,783
you know,
he was the best standup that I ever saw 

718
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:01,080
live.
And uh,

719
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,000
just keeping his name,
you know,

720
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,010
I always think that when,
anytime somebody says,

721
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,720
oh,
you're one of the top blah blah,

722
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:06,991
blah,
blah,

723
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:07,351
blah,
blah.

724
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,091
And I always think,
well,

725
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:08,924
you know,
if Patrice and Hedberg and all of these 

726
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,320
fucking guys do Freddy Soda,
what he would've done.

727
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,773
Just thinking about Freddy,
I was just thinking about that when you 

728
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:18,500
said that,
that maybe we should do one of those for

729
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,650
Freddy's family.
Yeah.

730
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,900
Freddie was like,
he was a brilliant.

731
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,930
Oh,
when he was,

732
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,580
where he would imitate his dad and shit.
Cardless.

733
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,080
Oh No,
it was like,

734
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,000
it was like,
yeah,

735
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,530
he would like hurt the crowd.
It was like,

736
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,000
he was like,
oh my God.

737
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,430
Stop.
Stop fucking guy too.

738
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,090
Yeah,
he was.

739
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,850
Every time you saw Freddy Soto is all 
about hugs.

740
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:39,960
Oh,
there's a good dude.

741
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,920
I last time,
last time I saw him,

742
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:42,040
we

743
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,920
were working in a number,
the aspen comedy festival.

744
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,030
Yeah.
I remember that.

745
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,830
And I didn't see him the last couple of 
years.

746
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:48,664
Maybe I saw him out in la,
but that was the time that I remembered 

747
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:52,330
because we were kind of in the same 
group,

748
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,420
Group B,
Group A or whatever.

749
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:55,254
So,
uh,

750
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,120
yeah,
he was walking around,

751
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:59,790
I think it was buying something for his 
wife or his kid or something like that.

752
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,600
I,
I,

753
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,590
that one.
Jesus,

754
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,410
you know,
you heard so many out of all of them.

755
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:07,230
He was when I was just like Freddie,
Freddie died.

756
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,123
I couldn't believe the sleep apnea.
Apparently sleep apnea and pills to go 

757
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:12,880
to sleep,
you know,

758
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,700
take ambien.
If you have sleep apnea,

759
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,680
you lock up and you just stopped 
breathing.

760
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,430
Sleep apnea is a real fucking problem.
I have it,

761
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,440
I took a mouthpiece mouthpiece in at 
night when I go to sleep,

762
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:25,800
but it keeps my tongue from falling back
on my throat.

763
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,420
A lot of athletes have it.
The bigger your neck gets,

764
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,430
the more muscle tissue you have in your 
neck,

765
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,980
the more closes off your air hole.
When you go to sleep,

766
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,843
like there's a lot of meat in there,
most stuff filling the night shift and 

767
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:39,114
dude,
what do you do when you got to get a 

768
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:45,651
barbell and just tied to the side of 
your fucking head effective working out.

769
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,220
You just get a big no one can straggle 
you.

770
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,380
That is what it is for real like,
well,

771
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:53,760
someone could definitely still strangle 
you,

772
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,240
but it helps a lot.
Like if you get ahold of a regular neck.

773
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,321
Regular.
Next,

774
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,370
just comply.

775
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,200
Please call your next special regular 
neck.

776
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,450
I guarantee no one's going to try and 
accidentally take that

777
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,840
title.
Regular neck,

778
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,700
regular neck,
Joe Rogan,

779
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,950
regular neck.
It's hard coming up with a good name for

780
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:15,930
a special.
Are you?

781
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,983
Somebody told me you were doing.
Are we saying that you're going to do 

782
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:19,300
your next one?
Independent,

783
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:20,440
you're going to do it independent?

784
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,900
No,
I don't know how I'm going to do it.

785
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,390
I'm,
I'm exploring all the options and all of

786
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:25,780
that.
I'm,

787
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,810
I'm trying.
I was trying to figure out a way to uh,

788
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,753
you know,
because it's just a ton of specials out 

789
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,130
there.
We're just trying to figure out a way.

790
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:35,050
But I mean,
you know,

791
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,770
when was the last time you filmed a 
October?

792
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,410
Twenty 16.
So,

793
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,723
um,
do,

794
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,221
um,
do.

795
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:43,054
Um,
but it's like,

796
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,650
am I do?
I Dunno.

797
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,730
I Dunno.
Like I don't,

798
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:46,564
I don't.
Uh,

799
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,670
it's,
it's what it is.

800
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:51,610
Is the special has changed since you and
I started.

801
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,500
Yeah,
a special was special.

802
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,693
Now what it is,
is it's just kind of an on hour long 

803
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:57,544
advertisement letting people know that 
you're still out there and it's like 

804
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:03,010
this just doesn't have documents your 
stuff though.

805
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,580
Yeah,
it does,

806
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,413
it does it.
But there's just such a sheer amount of 

807
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,010
stuff to see to have like an impact the 
way like I was trying to think maybe the

808
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,200
last one that really was just like whoa.

809
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,410
And I would say it would be like maybe 
Dave chappelle killing them softly.

810
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:24,220
Certainly Chris rock bring the pain 
where it was just like,

811
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,953
you know,
I'm not saying there weren't ones that 

812
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,230
like,
like people talked about,

813
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,580
but like just that thing where like,
do you remember when we were kids it was

814
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:34,810
just like,
you know,

815
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:35,740
Friday,
Hey man,

816
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:38,740
see you on Monday.
And then somehow on Monday everybody saw

817
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,790
or everybody saw dice or everybody saw 
Sam kinison on,

818
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,110
on the,
um,

819
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,591
the,
uh,

820
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:46,424
the dangerfield thing.
And it was just like no one was talking 

821
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:50,210
about it.
And then just like,

822
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:51,044
there was only so many channels and that
thing just caught enough people's eyes 

823
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,290
and you came to school Monday and 
everyone was just talking about it.

824
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,180
Like,
um,

825
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,011
you know,
I'm,

826
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:03,740
I'm still getting fucking tweets from 
people saying,

827
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,390
Hey,
I finally got around to watching,

828
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:09,890
breaking bad,
you know what I mean?

829
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,140
Or like I was talking about the wire one
time,

830
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:12,681
they were like,
dude,

831
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:13,670
you,
you could've said,

832
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:14,504
spoiler alert.
It's like that fucking went off the air 

833
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:18,110
in like 2006.
Like,

834
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,540
how much time do I have to give you to 
watch it,

835
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,890
you know.
So,

836
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,530
um,
I still haven't seen the water due.

837
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:25,790
My Buddy,
his uh,

838
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,040
his son,
the number one thing that he,

839
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,420
he,
he watches.

840
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,003
Is he on his phone?
He's watching one of these guys that 

841
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:33,854
gets paid to play video games.
He watches this guy on his phone play 

842
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,170
video games.
Everybody does that.

843
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay.
So yes.

844
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,170
So now that's another thing to watch 
exact.

845
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,450
Forget about online porn and fucking me 
watching Eric,

846
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:49,250
the car guy and all that.
Trying to,

847
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,173
trying to like find like where you can 
like drop the pamphlets of your career 

848
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:57,800
basically to be like,
hey man,

849
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,660
I'm still around.
I think

850
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,650
there's definitely more content now than
ever before,

851
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:05,050
but for,
in terms of the amount of standup that's

852
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:05,884
available,
there's never been more great standup 

853
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:09,520
available to watch.
Yeah.

854
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,890
Like think about how many specials there
are now.

855
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,550
I mean,
it's fun.

856
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,770
It's fucking crazy.
It really is.

857
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,620
It is.
Um,

858
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,440
it's,
yeah.

859
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,480
So they're not really specials.
They're not specialists.

860
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,343
They're not specialists because because 
it used to be specialist used to be the 

861
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:26,894
top comics,
now arguably it was basically the top 

862
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,194
white male comics.
So the fact that they fixed that is a 

863
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:33,700
great thing.
But now

864
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,240
though,
I mean Chris Rock,

865
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,490
Dave Chappelle,
Damon Wayans,

866
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,860
there was a lot,
there was a lot of white guys.

867
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,620
There was a lot of white guys with a lot
of great black guys too.

868
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,980
Really the real problem was women.
There wasn't very many women.

869
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,670
Like women are like

870
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,600
three stations.
There's Apaches,

871
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,830
there's other people out there doing 
standup specials.

872
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,570
There's got to be anyways.
But what I'm saying was,

873
00:34:57,571 --> 00:34:59,460
but it was the best,
the best,

874
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:02,970
where now it's just everybody.
It's everybody,

875
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,141
right?
So,

876
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:08,640
like I remember when I remember when it 
was changing when I was doing a club and

877
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,513
uh,
the feature act was complaining that he 

878
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:13,860
didn't get a half hour special on one of
these networks.

879
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,130
And I'm thinking like your feature act 
and like,

880
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:17,930
what are you,
what are you going to,

881
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,763
you're going to do your whole act and 
you're still a feature and you want to 

882
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:25,530
document that.
And it's just like they used to give out

883
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,363
half hour specials when I started out 
and it was to like guys who had been on 

884
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:32,070
the road for like 15 years and they will
pick it up from there,

885
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,380
headlining our,
uh,

886
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:35,214
they will take half of that,
like the best bits from an and then you 

887
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:38,904
know.
And that's somehow through time just 

888
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,450
became a feature going up and doing his 
whole act.

889
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,880
Well,
Netflix is doing that now.

890
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:48,240
They have the degenerate special.
They have a big J did one.

891
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,880
Joey Diaz did one.
Christina Palicki did one.

892
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,943
Um,

893
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,140
I'm not saying it's bad,
I'm just saying it's changed,

894
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,280
right?
So because it's,

895
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,114
it's even changed since my last special 
that I put out my last advertisement 

896
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:05,000
that I put out a hour long advertising.
Um,

897
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,053
so you just try to figure out,
because everything's just fucking 

898
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:09,654
changing so fast.
You just trying to navigate like where 

899
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:14,440
can I put this in all of this,
right?

900
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,250
That it's going to blink enough that 
someone's going to stare at it.

901
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:18,510
And maybe like,
watch the thing.

902
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:20,250
I just noticed you fucking lights with 
the sky.

903
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,390
That's pretty critical,
right?

904
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,283
Yes.

905
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,660
She was the company that makes those 
octo lights.

906
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Shout out to octo lights.
Gavigan did an interesting thing.

907
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:34,000
He decided not to put his newest one on 
Netflix.

908
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:37,630
He puts it on everything.
It's on Hulu and Amazon.

909
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:40,420
You can get it on itunes but not 
netflix.

910
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Yeah,
he's a smart guy.

911
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,570
Well he just took a chance,
I guess,

912
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:44,404
you know,
just decided to see what happens if you 

913
00:36:46,181 --> 00:36:48,280
just make it available everywhere 
instead.

914
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,620
Yeah,
I'd like to talk to him,

915
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:52,030
see how successful that was.

916
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,353
Yeah.
I love because I'm still working out my 

917
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:57,230
straight.
I'll talk to you off air because I don't

918
00:36:57,231 --> 00:37:01,730
want because it fucks with my ability to
make something happen.

919
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:04,340
So I'll,
I'll tell you what my idea was,

920
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,770
but that got nixed.

921
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,960
I've thought about doing it and just put
it right on youtube.

922
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,080
I've thought about doing that before was
not getting paid for it.

923
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,780
Just shoving it right on youtube.
Just see what happens.

924
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,130
Yeah.
And Youtube.

925
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:17,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

926
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,773
Just paying for it and just sticking it 
out there because if it is an 

927
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:23,970
advertisement,
what's the best way to get it out there?

928
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:24,804
Well,
the best way would just be to put it on 

929
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:26,274
youtube and then to segment it into like
little chunks so that people can digest 

930
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:33,210
it in.
People wind up doing that.

931
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,373
I don't think netflix takes them down.
I think when you have a bits up that 

932
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,940
like from specials that,
that go up on Netflix,

933
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:43,670
I think Netflix just let them stay up.
It

934
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,500
just depends on what your,
uh,

935
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,340
what your contract is because you can 
work that in.

936
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,570
We did a special with Paul all things 
comedy network.

937
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,750
We did a special with him which was,
did phenomenal,

938
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:59,950
like broke all their online streaming.
Uh,

939
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,023
um,
records and it was great because he was 

940
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:05,790
a guy that they don't really give 
special.

941
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,561
Right.
Right.

942
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:07,130
Now,
you know,

943
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,470
who did he do the special for?
Comedy Central.

944
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,060
Oh,
uh,

945
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,580
so the streaming version was really 
successful.

946
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,590
Yeah.
I mean he,

947
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,830
he did well on well now trying to get 
people to actually just fucking sit down

948
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:22,100
and watch television.
Like everybody tape you tape shit,

949
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,420
right?
That's just how it works,

950
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:25,190
which is now if you watch like NFL 
Games,

951
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:26,024
they have this thing now where the 
game's going on and all of a sudden the 

952
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:29,354
game slides to the left and then there's
two boxes and the advertising boxes 

953
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,570
bigger because they know everybody's 
taping games and they're blowing through

954
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,404
it and advertisers somehow can tell if 
someone fast forwarded through and then 

955
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:44,050
that they,
the nfl doesn't make as much money.

956
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,883
So now they're,
they're running like this is where they 

957
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:47,784
take these two things.
So you don't really have to look at the 

958
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:49,504
commercial,
you can just sit there looking at the 

959
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,244
game,
but then they're telling you about 

960
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:55,060
fucking whatever at the same time.
Yeah,

961
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,230
it's weird.
That's gross.

962
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,320
It's gross,
but isn't.

963
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,730
I mean that's how I make money off 
advertising.

964
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:01,840
It's like my thing,
what,

965
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:05,520
what's gross is,
is how your uh,

966
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,400
what,
you know,

967
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,980
if you're dumping shit in the water 
supply,

968
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,410
if you got like all kinds of like,
you know,

969
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:14,370
I mean I think they all have some sort 
of labor fucking issues.

970
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,293
I would like that still.
I would like to be able to pay to not 

971
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,650
have that.
Like if I could Amazon one click,

972
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:20,484
I'm like,
how much I got to give you for each 

973
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:23,364
game?
Well,

974
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,890
don't have to see that.
Yeah,

975
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,440
but they'll give you.
But what the advertiser will do is their

976
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:31,500
pockets are deeper and they're going,
they're going to go.

977
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,533
They're going to find like.
What's funny is when the Internet 

978
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:34,984
started out,
all of a sudden you went from watching 

979
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:37,204
seeing all these commercials to like 
nothing to now seeing way more than you 

980
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,130
ever saw.
Yeah.

981
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,020
Like my,
the worst is when you watch an hour long

982
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:48,090
youtube video and then all of a sudden 
it just stops and you know,

983
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,933
they try to make,
make a nice break and then you just 

984
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:51,880
watched this and it annoys me.
But I'm like,

985
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:53,350
well,
I do advertise on my podcast.

986
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,000
How upset about this can I get?

987
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,440
Um,
you know,

988
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,341
I don't know.
When you see,

989
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:03,270
when you look at the line and you see 
those little yellow lines on the youtube

990
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:04,910
video,
we know that's where the fucking ads are

991
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:06,670
going to pop up.
No,

992
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,610
I didn't know that.
Isn't that how it works?

993
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

994
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,560
I mean look,
advertising is what it is.

995
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:14,394
I mean it's either that or you do like a
Patriot type deal when you have people 

996
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:20,970
contribute like Sam Harris does that,
right?

997
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,073
It doesn't,

998
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,930
you know,
there's a million ways to do it,

999
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,910
but like I don't get mad at advertising 
because like I said,

1000
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:28,550
a standup specials me advertising,
then I'm going to be out on the road.

1001
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,130
You say that,
but it's not,

1002
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,500
it's entertainment.
It's people that watch it.

1003
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,270
They can enjoy it.
Like thinking about it

1004
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,520
that there's a way also to do 
advertising entertainment like way back.

1005
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:39,354
Those less filling tastes.
Great Bud Light Miller lite commercials 

1006
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:42,894
were fucking funny.
They were great and you wanted to see 

1007
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:47,640
them and you love them or at least I 
did.

1008
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,170
So yeah,
there's ways,

1009
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,030
there's ways to do everything.
They still have some,

1010
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,863
some good commercials.
Like what's that insurance lady who's 

1011
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,700
always in those commercials.
What does that flow flow?

1012
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,260
She's,
she's fucking funny.

1013
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,780
This funny commercial still,
but it's,

1014
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,860
you know,
it's hard.

1015
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,023
I know Seinfeld was actually thinking 
about opening up an insurance agency at 

1016
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:07,830
one point in time because he apparently 
likes writing,

1017
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:11,790
stuff like that and he was literally 
thinking of an advertising agency.

1018
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,653
When I say insurance advertising,
he was thinking about doing that at one 

1019
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:16,290
point in time.
Yeah,

1020
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,810
but making ads that he was probably 
like,

1021
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:20,250
wait a minute.
I don't want to have a real job.

1022
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,630
It was like,
how much money do I need?

1023
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,780
Time guys like that make me feel normal 
with like car collecting.

1024
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,060
Like when I went to Jay Leno's place,
he's got 11 buildings filled with cars.

1025
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,710
I'm like,
oh,

1026
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,370
okay.

1027
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,960
I see where this goes.
Yes,

1028
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,440
I got to give my son.
He has a.

1029
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,720
He is,
I've never been over there,

1030
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:39,554
but he has,
he has enough cars to start his own 

1031
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,374
traffic jam on the.
He could fill up the four or five one 

1032
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:44,594
side of it.
I would think he could fill up the 

1033
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:48,230
Pasadena rose bowl.
He can fill up the fucking parking lot.

1034
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,880
It's ridiculous.
I'll take you.

1035
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,350
You want to go?
Yeah.

1036
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,980
But does he have been your truck?
Does he have more?

1037
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,860
Uh,
uh,

1038
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,990
cars then days of the year.
Oh yeah.

1039
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,660
Because I know he also has like 
motorcycles.

1040
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,180
He said he's got that.
That's another one.

1041
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:07,790
That's another one.
I went down the rabbit hole is a.

1042
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,570
was it Jay's garage?
Yeah.

1043
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,710
Yeah.
Great show.

1044
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,690
Oh yeah,
I loved it.

1045
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,021
No,
I,

1046
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:13,970
I,
yeah,

1047
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,860
I got into all the gas monkey garage.

1048
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,250
Jay's garage getting that gas monkey gun
on the show.

1049
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,810
Oh,
Richard Rawlings.

1050
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:22,160
Yeah.
I just got an email yesterday.

1051
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,250
He asked me,
that guy's a love guy's a fucking right.

1052
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,760
I love that guy.
Ask him about my favorite episode,

1053
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,990
my favorite fucking episode of that 
because he always,

1054
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:34,310
like,
I watched that show so much.

1055
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:37,400
I knew the number was going to come at.
They'd be like,

1056
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:38,450
okay,
what do you want for this gun?

1057
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:40,700
And he always get them to say it first 
and then you're like,

1058
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,600
ah.
I mean I was,

1059
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,220
I was thinking like a five grand and 
then he'd be,

1060
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:47,990
oh,
five now man,

1061
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:48,800
I can't.
I mean,

1062
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,990
I mean I,
I could do,

1063
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,470
I could do like $2,700.
Right?

1064
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,333
And then the fucking guy would then go 
down to four grand and he would come up 

1065
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,960
like,
like 300 bucks and he didn't ever get in

1066
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:01,910
the car for like three grand,
like whatever the fuck you want it.

1067
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:02,743
Right.
So one time he went out and he busted 

1068
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,290
this guy down on like a,
a,

1069
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,840
an old trans am or a firebird.
Assam Shit.

1070
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:12,620
I forget what the guy sells it to him 
for like fucking,

1071
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,710
he wanted like 18 grand or something.
He sold it to him for like 11.

1072
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:17,923
So he fucking gets the car over there.
He's talking about he's going to do 

1073
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:23,090
about with it and all of a sudden the 
guy's brother calls up and says,

1074
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:23,924
Hey,
that guy didn't have the fucking right 

1075
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:27,350
to sell that car.
That's also mine.

1076
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:28,640
You got to,
you know,

1077
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,950
I'm going to come down and go,
I got to buy it back from you.

1078
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,580
So the guy comes down and he's,
you know,

1079
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,880
asked him what he wants for it in 
Richard's just.

1080
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,260
I mean I was thinking like 20.
And the guy goes,

1081
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,340
he goes,
dude,

1082
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,390
you bought it from my brother.

1083
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,310
I know what you paid for it.
He actually got embarrassed.

1084
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:44,180
He's like,
Oh man,

1085
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,530
that's the only time I ever saw him get 
like embarrassed.

1086
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,750
He wasn't,
he just went into like his,

1087
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,280
his thing and like,
I swear to God,

1088
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:53,114
like watching that show,
like you get better at negotiating and 

1089
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:58,580
like,
uh,

1090
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,340
and like occasionally he does like these
sketches to where he,

1091
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,533
he'll do like a character imitating like
an old school used car salesman and you 

1092
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:08,670
just how good he does it.
Cause you know,

1093
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,250
it's like he's a performer or an act or 
anything.

1094
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:12,110
How good he does.
It's like this guy is like,

1095
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,660
this is just in his blood.
He's just been a car guy.

1096
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,130
He's been flipping cars.
I'm trying to,

1097
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,013
I'm seeing the show in a minute.
But like he used to talk about how he 

1098
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,130
uh,
uh,

1099
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:24,830
you know,
by the time he was 19 he was on his 30th

1100
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:25,730
car or something.
Like,

1101
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,380
he was just like,
I like that car,

1102
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:28,580
I'm gonna buy this car.
Like that one.

1103
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:30,350
And even just every month would just 
flip them.

1104
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,430
Those cars.

1105
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:37,430
There's something about those shows that
if those an auction shows or anytime,

1106
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,580
like a pawn shop shows that something 
about wanting to know how the deal plays

1107
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:44,950
out,
you know,

1108
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,940
that is so compelling for people.
There's something like,

1109
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,100
and I'm a moron,
I'll just sit there staring like,

1110
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:52,530
how much are they going to get?
How much they're going to get for that?

1111
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,540
Yeah.
Who that civil war coins,

1112
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,330
what are those worth

1113
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,130
and how much they busted down and just 
like,

1114
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:57,964
yeah,
that Guy Richard is probably the best 

1115
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:00,394
I've seen.
He's the most entertaining because he's 

1116
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:04,720
like a fun guy to watch.
It's a performance.

1117
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:05,580
Yeah.
He's like,

1118
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,760
ah man,
I man.

1119
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,410
I was thinking,
Oh man,

1120
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:09,550
I don't know.
Yeah.

1121
00:45:09,551 --> 00:45:11,680
And then he goes up there and he pulls 
out this giant Wad.

1122
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:12,101
It's like,
dude,

1123
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:13,750
you had it,
you had the money.

1124
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:15,670
They look.
I asked to sit there and watch it.

1125
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,800
Then he kind of makes fun of him 
afterwards,

1126
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:19,843
you know,
we can kinda make like a funny way or 

1127
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:22,450
whatever.
But um,

1128
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,110
it's a funny thing to that how appealing
that is to men.

1129
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,243
Like I bet if you looked at the number 
of women who watch those car shows 

1130
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,203
versus the number of motor trend has a 
channel now they have their own channel 

1131
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,553
and I guarantee you that 97 percent 
dudes and three percent women 

1132
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:43,250
complaining three percent women going,
what the fuck are you watching?

1133
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,200
Like if you looked at the actual 
numbers,

1134
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:49,190
like what is it about cars?
Like girls can drive cars,

1135
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,830
girls drive cars all the time.
Girls liked cars.

1136
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,750
They don't like cars with guys like 
cars.

1137
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,130
It just.
Most of them.

1138
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:56,030
Generally speaking.
Yeah.

1139
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,730
Outside of like Danica Patrick and few 
psychos.

1140
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,890
Yeah,
I met her one time.

1141
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,430
I saw a picture with you.
She did.

1142
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,790
She took me around the Indianapolis 
Motor speedway

1143
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,000
coming down that straight away and 
seeing like you know,

1144
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:08,843
where they have the leaderboard and 
everything was iconic and I've been to 

1145
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:13,910
that race a couple of times so it was 
crazy fast.

1146
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:15,580
Were you going.
She ended up,

1147
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,820
she only went like half the speed of 
what the car,

1148
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,160
how fast they would be going to 
somebody,

1149
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:21,994
and we got up to maybe like 1:40,
but we were like going around turns and 

1150
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:24,874
like my face is doing this,
but what I loved about her was she had 

1151
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:31,870
like a test pilot vibe.
Yeah.

1152
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,680
Like she came up and was just vice,
like,

1153
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,610
handshake and shit.
Beast.

1154
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,990
Yeah.
It was pretty.

1155
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:39,970
Uh,
you guys are.

1156
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,550
Yeah.
She was just totally like,

1157
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,580
a little different than her sunglasses 
in my sunglasses.

1158
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:47,590
I definitely,
I've passenger sunglasses.

1159
00:46:47,591 --> 00:46:49,270
You know what he's talking about?
They look the same.

1160
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,111
No,
no,

1161
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,944
no.
Those are like right off the fucking 

1162
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,770
shelf.
What's wrong with your sunglasses?

1163
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,570
Verse Hers,
like you'll see it.

1164
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,590
I tell him the details.
Come on man.

1165
00:46:57,591 --> 00:46:59,830
That's like me.
I probably,

1166
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,673
you know,
your crescent kick probably looks the 

1167
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:03,510
same as fucking some guy.
A strip mall to me

1168
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:08,110
literacy's a crescent as one of the 
rarest kicks anybody ever pulls off.

1169
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,150
It's leftover from the eighties,
whatever.

1170
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,150
Um,
but that's kind of legit.

1171
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,430
Crossing kicks,
kind of legit.

1172
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:18,650
I thing about Mika is after awhile it 
just all becomes like shelby toxins.

1173
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,550
Yeah.
And Hammy,

1174
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,573
Hammy Kudo.
We get a Hemi cuda coming up and plum 

1175
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,750
crazy.
Those fucking things are too much.

1176
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,940
Do you buy those things for a million 
dollars?

1177
00:47:27,941 --> 00:47:29,980
And when the car came out was like 20 
grand.

1178
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,083
I mean not even,

1179
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,980
but I like,
I like weird shit.

1180
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,583
I like,
you know,

1181
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,473
I want to get a 76 GMC rv.
That's what I want to go on the road 

1182
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,660
with.
And then they had,

1183
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:43,150
this thing was,
I think it was called Palm Palm,

1184
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,630
desert green or something like that.
It was like this total Ron Burgundy.

1185
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,570
If you click on the interior and that 
thing was way ahead of it's time,

1186
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,150
it's time.
It's amazing.

1187
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,270
Look at that fucking piece of shit.
That's not a piece of shit.

1188
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,360
That's fucking tremendous swivel.
Oh my God.

1189
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,483
Tell take something.
You walk off stage and get on that 

1190
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:09,340
fucking thing.
You feel like a king.

1191
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,400
You got a driver.
What do you give a fuck?

1192
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,163
You don't give a fuck about anything.
I can be on the road forever and that 

1193
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,700
just making eggs on that little stove 
top.

1194
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,220
Now you're in there drinking.
You're doing what you want.

1195
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:23,320
You watching goodfellas or fucking 
anchorman.

1196
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,360
That is pretty beautiful.
It's so.

1197
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,670
Well it's an experience to your riding 
that thing.

1198
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,880
That's a retro experience as not just a 
truck.

1199
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,780
Yeah.
That thing I,

1200
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:35,790
you know,
my wife Nixed it.

1201
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,190
What are you going to put her in the 
fucking drive and we'll keep it.

1202
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,280
I don't need it.
She was right.

1203
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,910
My wife's always.
Not always,

1204
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:46,310
but mostly women don't like when you 
collect shit,

1205
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,160
like where are you going to put that?
They don't like that.

1206
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,263
You get too many things.
I have the reason why I got this place 

1207
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,100
collection here.
Oh yeah.

1208
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,310
Nobody could say nothing.
The spot on says nothing.

1209
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,060
No,
but then it becomes.

1210
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,500
You spend more time down there.
Then you don't though.

1211
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,220
I got it.
I got it nailed.

1212
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,800
I figured it out.
Get up early.

1213
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,060
You're being such a jerk.
That's why they don't have a point.

1214
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,103
I don't.
I actually,

1215
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,410
I can actually refute your opinion,
your point or whatever.

1216
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,450
It's so universal too.
All we would have that response like,

1217
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,340
the fuck is wrong with you,
and they.

1218
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,860
We had a highway.
That's it.

1219
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,833
Well,
imagine being them watching you imagine 

1220
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:32,190
being a woman have taken care of your 
children.

1221
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,270
You know,
you give birth.

1222
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,133
You had this little tiny infant and then
financially you're relying on this 

1223
00:49:37,201 --> 00:49:41,070
fucking maniac,
so they're flying helicopters and fixing

1224
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:43,500
cars.
I know playing drums all day.

1225
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:44,680
He's like,
what are you?

1226
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,370
As long as the money keeps coming in,
they can't say anything,

1227
00:49:47,371 --> 00:49:49,260
but they're like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1228
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,970
The end of the day,
you married an eight year old,

1229
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,010
wouldn't marry a comedian.
Oh,

1230
00:49:56,011 --> 00:49:57,740
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1231
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,190
You're lucky.
We're not drug addicts.

1232
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,730
Yeah,
yeah.

1233
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,410
No,
I'm,

1234
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:04,190
I'm,
I gotta.

1235
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,540
I gotta work on myself,
man.

1236
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:06,620
I got fucking,
you know,

1237
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,533
I,
I just,

1238
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,200
I am a difficult person to live with.
Evidently.

1239
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,543
I didn't realize it,
but like I'm now looking at it honestly 

1240
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:17,060
stepping back and look.
I go,

1241
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:17,894
yeah,
I can see that.

1242
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,330
I can fucking see that.
I've thought about it.

1243
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,150
I'm definitely difficult,
but if you don't think about it,

1244
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:24,440
that reminds you about it.
Yeah.

1245
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,540
Imagine relying on me.
I mean I'm reliable.

1246
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,030
Like I want to be responsible.
If you,

1247
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,510
you could have married the me that 
worked in a fucking warehouse,

1248
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:37,040
that I would have been the same thing,
you know,

1249
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:40,460
and we would be in a studio apartment.
Here's the deal though.

1250
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,930
One that married yet they would've found
someone better.

1251
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,393
Yeah,

1252
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,620
yeah,
yeah.

1253
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,240
If you were just fucking off,
never got your shit together,

1254
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:52,460
you know what it's about.
Limit to is their ability to move on.

1255
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,850
Yeah.
Like I've,

1256
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,760
I've always said like if I have a 
fucking died,

1257
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,130
how quickly all my clothes will be at 
down at the goodwill,

1258
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,030
you know,
and she'd just be like,

1259
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:00,864
you know,
sell the house that's just burned some 

1260
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,490
sage.
That was interesting.

1261
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,910
Alright,
well next step to the plate.

1262
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,250
All my discussions with biologists and 
people who study like w what's Gad,

1263
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,900
sadly,
what is his discipline?

1264
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,220
Behavioral Psychology.
But he studies Gad said,

1265
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,030
is that his last name?
It's his fullness.

1266
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,610
A D,
g,

1267
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:26,090
a d.
that's his first name.

1268
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,270
Gad S A,
a d is his last name.

1269
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,870
Is it?
Does it rhyme?

1270
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,520
Does it also Ronnie's Canadian 
evolutionary behavioral scientist.

1271
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,320
Brilliant guy.
He was so in Lebanon.

1272
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,720
Does his name still rhyme?
That's a good question.

1273
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,050
Is there anywhere he can know me?
My name is.

1274
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:44,810
Gad said.
Now he calls himself the Godfather.

1275
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,330
He's great.
Oh,

1276
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:50,030
so he just steered into it.
He's a great guy.

1277
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,760
I can imagine these 13 but brilliant.

1278
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,960
I last talked to you about why would you
name me

1279
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,340
Gad?
Sad.

1280
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,320
I don't think sad means the same thing 
over there.

1281
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,330
You know,

1282
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,520
different language.
The end of the day it rhymes.

1283
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,910
There's no country you can be on.
You can be on that fucking little island

1284
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:07,744
with a shot.
That guy with the arrows and they get 

1285
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,461
they're gonna.
Make Fun of.

1286
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:11,960
You should probably kick you off the 
island can.

1287
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,320
You can't name.
You see some of these celebrities.

1288
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:15,760
Some of the fucking names.
They named their kids.

1289
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:17,950
It's just like,
don't you remember school?

1290
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,500
But you don't remember how fucking mean 
kids were.

1291
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,903
Why are you giving the plate?
Painting a fucking by getting your 

1292
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:26,540
creative.
Yeah.

1293
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:30,040
Have a meditation room.
Fucking don't do that with the name.

1294
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,200
Oh,
give them a nice bill name.

1295
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,800
William.
This is folding chair Johnson.

1296
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,953
People need to express themselves.
They do it through the naming of their 

1297
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:42,280
tools.
Children.

1298
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,440
My other favorite thing that what they 
do is when they fucking,

1299
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:49,030
they put their political agenda on them 
like the kid doesn't even have a fucking

1300
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:50,290
chance.
Like this whole thing,

1301
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,124
like gender roles.
They bs by the way that my little 

1302
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,860
experience being a dad,
going to kid birthday parties,

1303
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,113
they.
Those kids are not old enough for that 

1304
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:05,350
behavior to be learned through.
The kids come.

1305
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,070
The boys show up.
It is fucking brave heart.

1306
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,030
They come over the fucking hill.
The girls are social.

1307
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,953
They're sitting there.
That kind of that taking things in in 

1308
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,830
our kids.
Boys come in,

1309
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:22,831
they fucking dude.
We were at one on Saturday and there was

1310
00:53:22,931 --> 00:53:24,610
this.
This kid was hilarious.

1311
00:53:24,611 --> 00:53:26,580
He looked like A.
Bobby Hurley is a point guard,

1312
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:29,070
right,
and he was playing this game.

1313
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:30,890
He had like this ball and he was using 
his.

1314
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:31,743
His,
his forums is a bat and he was hitting 

1315
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:33,570
it.

1316
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,310
Then you would catch it,
then he would throw it between his legs.

1317
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:38,340
He was doing all this other kid hand eye
coordination was great for his age,

1318
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,443
so over in the corner where I was 
sitting with my daughter was these 

1319
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,833
little like sort of like cushions that 
someone had put together like three 

1320
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:47,010
piece thing and made it into like a 
little chair for.

1321
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:50,400
So an old person like me could sit down.
So I stood up because I was worried that

1322
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:51,970
ball was going to hit,
so it's kind of guarding that.

1323
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,740
So he went over and got the ball at one 
point and just seeing the chair there,

1324
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,390
you know,
all built like that.

1325
00:53:57,391 --> 00:54:00,180
He just saw it and just kicked it,
just destroyed it.

1326
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:01,530
And then continued on.
I was thinking like,

1327
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,700
why did he do that?
Because he's a boy.

1328
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,691
He's a boy.
Yeah.

1329
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:06,920
We like ruined shit.

1330
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,193
Well you got a lot of energy.
Little kids like need something to do 

1331
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,980
that's physical.
The little bodies have the little little

1332
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:16,570
batteries overflowing with energy.

1333
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:22,310
That shit was all about like grabbing,
throwing,

1334
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,990
breaking,
breaking.

1335
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,440
Yeah.
Do you remember being a kid?

1336
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,600
Yeah,
I already did that.

1337
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,840
This whole thing of like,
like,

1338
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,250
well women aren't aggressive like that 
because you know,

1339
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:34,080
a slow standards.
Yeah,

1340
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:36,470
I think it's,
they're aggressive in la.

1341
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,403
I think that they,
they literally from like just survival 

1342
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:40,020
shit.
They are looking at like,

1343
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,730
all right,
that's what I have to compete with.

1344
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:42,564
And there are,
you see them looking at the boys who 

1345
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:47,034
appear to be dominating and what they 
are is they're actually showing all of 

1346
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:51,354
their carts and the little girls are 
already taken and in breaking them down 

1347
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,093
knowing,
well I can't get physical with this 

1348
00:54:57,121 --> 00:54:57,954
person.
I can't like dominate this person 

1349
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:00,510
physically.
This is definitely.

1350
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,733
And they just immediately stuck on,
like that's why they're fucking smarter 

1351
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:04,710
than real,
I think.

1352
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:11,020
No,
did I lose you somewhere in there?

1353
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,770
I don't necessarily think they're 
smarter

1354
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,863
going on is that uh,
men have different DNA in the genes or 

1355
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,683
aggressive

1356
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,840
men are to be doing reckless shit.
Right.

1357
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,560
That's,
I'm just saying it's nice to run society

1358
00:55:27,561 --> 00:55:31,640
didn't sit down and watch three cereal 
commercials and then be like,

1359
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,010
oh,
I need to be fucking this.

1360
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:34,933
I just think that's,
that's just some bullshit that adults 

1361
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:42,060
come came up with and judge

1362
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,770
as adults,
it's almost always women.

1363
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,723
It's women that think that there's 
something wrong with the way men are 

1364
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:48,084
raising their sons.
They think there's something that like 

1365
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:50,863
this idea of these men raising these 
kids and these kids being aggressive is 

1366
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:56,520
because of the way they're being 
coached.

1367
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,443
That's not true.
It's just that's just a part of being a 

1368
00:55:58,801 --> 00:55:59,634
boy.
This is a shit ton of studies of people 

1369
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:04,680
wanted to actually look at the science.
I mean if you leave boys alone with toys

1370
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:05,723
and girls along with toys,
boys will gravitate towards trucks and 

1371
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,750
fucking,
you know,

1372
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,643
things that they can hit and smash and 
girl sit down there with little teacups 

1373
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,390
and they play with dogs.
It's natural.

1374
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:19,980
Just a 100 percent natural.
There was a documentary on babies.

1375
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,900
You know what they.
Bees are gender neutral,

1376
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,010
raising their kids

1377
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,920
gender neutral,
so they don't call them a boy or a girl.

1378
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,200
And my thing with that is there's no 
way.

1379
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:30,034
You're not saying to your son,
you're sure you don't want to wear the 

1380
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:32,584
dress.
And then the kid wants to fucking have 

1381
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,450
wants to parents' approval.
Yeah,

1382
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:42,190
I didn't want that football.
I guess I wanted the dress and it's just

1383
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:43,120
like,
like I said,

1384
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,340
you know,
my kids barely two.

1385
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,300
So what the fuck do I know?
I'm just saying my limited experience at

1386
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:54,301
kids' birthday parties is not even how 
it was ever even questioned that.

1387
00:56:55,481 --> 00:57:00,340
Like they're too fucking too young.
The fucking year and a half,

1388
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:04,020
two years old.
Like you're telling me that society has,

1389
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,950
they have,
it's ridiculous.

1390
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,533
But it's,
it's usually women that want to push 

1391
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,530
this.
And men who are pitches.

1392
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,500
It's like these,
these men that don't like,

1393
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,080
they don't like aggressive man.

1394
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,870
They don't like manly men.
And so they,

1395
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,733
they push it as well.
It's not because they're aggressive and 

1396
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:24,460
they're controlling and they want to run
shit.

1397
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:25,294
And that's because that's the thing 
where like if you really look at their 

1398
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:28,024
agenda when they say the future is 
feminine that's not inclusive and 

1399
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:32,170
they're.
And they're all about,

1400
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:33,550
I'll make this more inclusive.
It's like,

1401
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:34,384
no,
let us in so we can take it over and 

1402
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:36,604
then we'll push you down.
Is is the psychology of the kind of 

1403
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:43,540
person that goes after that?
Someone that's after like power.

1404
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:45,160
I'm not saying the average woman is like
that.

1405
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,830
My wife is a feminist and she's 
intellect inclusive shit,

1406
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,963
but like people who are spearheading 
stuff like those people are wired the 

1407
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:53,820
same way.
Like you know,

1408
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,970
I mean a dominator is.
Yes,

1409
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,240
yes.
And there's gonna be no room for you.

1410
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,073
It's gonna be like think the way,
like a lot of that that's so called 

1411
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:06,700
progressives.
Extreme left is think the way we think.

1412
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:07,780
Save what we say.
Oh,

1413
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:08,614
we will fucking destroy you.
Pull up that tweet that I retweeted 

1414
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,550
today.
The David Pakman retweet.

1415
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,970
David Pacman's is liberal progressive 
guy.

1416
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,983
This woman posts on twitter,
she would never vote for a man or a 

1417
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:24,250
white,
a white man or white person,

1418
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,240
white male.
Why?

1419
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:31,180
Someone is white or male.
He says that's racist and sexist.

1420
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,680
It is.
So she blocks them on twitter today.

1421
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:36,514
She called Boston College demanding that
they not have him back as adjunct 

1422
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:42,880
faculty.
It's crazy.

1423
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,360
So this woman post this and he points 
out that it's racist and sexist,

1424
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,650
so she blocks them and she tries to get 
him fired.

1425
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,813
Okay,
this is why that whole thing is fucked 

1426
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:53,591
up.
Okay.

1427
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:57,370
Because he's acting like white people 
exist on an even plane,

1428
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,200
which is,
which a lot of people try to do.

1429
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,033
So it's like he's not necessarily he 
just saying that what she's saying is 

1430
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:03,754
racist and sexist because she's 
determining which is going to vote for 

1431
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,960
based on tire on the race.
But there's other elements involved like

1432
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:13,300
the level of that white people.
Not saying all white people,

1433
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:15,940
but white people have fucked over people
who are not white.

1434
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,040
Forget about poor white people who they 
fucked over.

1435
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,200
So you understand that.
But they're both.

1436
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:22,723
Right?
But then like the fact that she then 

1437
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:29,180
takes it to the point that because he 
had the audacity to have a difference of

1438
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:30,014
an opinion,
that that's the thing now in that now 

1439
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:33,560
we're going to destroy you and you can't
be on this thing.

1440
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:34,394
And then the other level of that is how 
the corporate entities are so afraid 

1441
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:39,584
that one fucking nickel is gonna roll 
out across all of this shit is just a 

1442
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:48,380
paper tiger until you get the big 
behemoth to listen to you and this,

1443
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:51,920
all of these,
these fucking things from award shows to

1444
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,950
this bullshit that someone just needs to
be like,

1445
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:56,500
listen,
this guy already apologized.

1446
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,750
This is,
this is an old fucking thing or a look,

1447
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,880
you just had a difference of opinion 
that,

1448
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:02,714
you know,
this isn't the first time you're going 

1449
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,840
to say something and somebody's going to
disagree with you.

1450
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:08,060
That doesn't mean that this guy can't 
come back.

1451
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,250
Um,
you know,

1452
01:00:10,251 --> 01:00:11,084
and you obviously because of some shit 
that's happened to you have an extreme 

1453
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,400
opinion about this guy because of the 
color of his skin.

1454
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:22,510
It's like there's so many fucked up 
elements to that that.

1455
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:25,730
But for some reason you can't,
like if you address that on any level,

1456
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,610
um,
then you're part of the problem.

1457
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:31,180
And it's not just part of the problem 
that she's trying to get him fired.

1458
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:35,100
She's trying to get him fired for 
pointing out that something is racist.

1459
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:37,150
I'm saying if you say what I just said,

1460
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,980
try to look at it three 60.
Oh yeah.

1461
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:40,814
And as much as I can,
which is why I love South Park is 

1462
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:44,320
everything that they do.
They do at three 60.

1463
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,360
Right.
And uh,

1464
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,350
so I learned a lot from that show by the
way.

1465
01:00:48,351 --> 01:00:50,810
They look at stuff like that because I 
don't fucking know everything,

1466
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,000
but even just to try to be like,
well,

1467
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:53,601
hey,
you know,

1468
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:54,480
you know,
insulted,

1469
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:57,260
salted them a little bit.
I understand what you're saying and blah

1470
01:00:57,261 --> 01:00:58,094
blah blah.
You can't fucking do that anymore 

1471
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:01,430
because then something you all part of 
the fucking problem.

1472
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,640
And no,
it's really good.

1473
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,590
Crazy crazy.
Got to the point like,

1474
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:07,100
I've seen like a name names,
but I've seen like a tweet from a fellow

1475
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:11,510
comic telling comics what jokes you 
shouldn't talk about this topic.

1476
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:12,763
It's like who the fuck are you?
Let's say there's already been enough 

1477
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:17,090
people doing that.
You're going to do like cannibalism now.

1478
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:21,260
Have you ever seen comics say real 
comics?

1479
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,930
Uh,
yeah.

1480
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,623
I mean,
everybody has their opinion on somebody 

1481
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,730
fucking act,
but I mean,

1482
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:29,870
yeah,
yeah,

1483
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,880
that's ridiculous.
That's not a real comic.

1484
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,111
Um,
well,

1485
01:01:33,111 --> 01:01:34,580
I wouldn't say that they are a real 
comic.

1486
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:36,920
They just have an opinion.
I don't agree with thinking fuck off.

1487
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,103
I mean,
I mean trying to have less 

1488
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,010
confrontations.
I understand in my life here.

1489
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,900
That kinda shit drives me crazy though.
What,

1490
01:01:47,901 --> 01:01:50,240
what drives me most crazy is this 
bullying,

1491
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,510
what she's trying to get him fired.
She tried to get him fired for having an

1492
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:55,310
opinion on something that she publicly 
stated.

1493
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:56,203
One of these,

1494
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,450
the,
somebody running one of these things has

1495
01:01:58,451 --> 01:02:00,040
to be like,
you know,

1496
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:00,973
and it can't just be private.
It has to be a public tweet to say that 

1497
01:02:05,081 --> 01:02:05,914
this is,
it's just going too far in this fucking 

1498
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:12,070
thing where you have a difference of an 
opinion now and they're just gonna,

1499
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:16,390
you know,
take your fucking job away.

1500
01:02:16,391 --> 01:02:17,860
You know,
I ran into this shit,

1501
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:18,850
you know,
when,

1502
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,390
you know,
uh,

1503
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,890
when the,
me too stuff first started coming out,

1504
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:24,450
people would try to like,
you know,

1505
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,760
you know,
you had to tweet the right fucking thing

1506
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:28,950
and if,
if you said anything sort of,

1507
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:30,810
oh it's,
let's look at the evidence,

1508
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:31,644
God forbid you fucking said that.
It just became like this whole part of 

1509
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:37,620
the problem.
Then they would try to take you down or,

1510
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:39,630
or,
or someone you were,

1511
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,960
you were friends with or doing a show 
with a represented by.

1512
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,610
They would try to do like that pressure 
to try in.

1513
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:49,260
And it was just like,
you know,

1514
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:49,891
I have to say,
I was like,

1515
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:50,820
no,
I'm not doing that.

1516
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:53,970
And then it just goes away because you 
don't have to fucking leg to stand on

1517
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,130
people that are doing it.
It's a small percentage of

1518
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,520
unbelievably small,
unbelievably small.

1519
01:03:00,521 --> 01:03:01,354
And the comics,
it's like we're literally running for 

1520
01:03:04,211 --> 01:03:05,044
office.
We're out there campaigning for this 

1521
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:09,220
election that never happens.
And you're going through red states,

1522
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:10,930
blue states,
you going through fucking everything.

1523
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,870
And the general consensus of people is 
like,

1524
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,621
like,
dude,

1525
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:17,230
that was fucking crazy like that.
That doesn't make sense,

1526
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:21,490
but no one wants to say it because 
they're going to get steamrolled.

1527
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,100
And

1528
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:22,933
I saw what happened to Matt Damon.
Matt Damon said we have to make a 

1529
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:28,430
differentiation between the Harvey 
Weinsteins in the world.

1530
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,300
And then someone who like Aziz Ansari,
he goes on a bad date,

1531
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,890
there's a big difference between those 
two.

1532
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,710
And they attacked him and they tried to 
get them pulled off of that movie.

1533
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:37,544
Ocean's eight.

1534
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,940
Yeah.
And they were acting like that,

1535
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:40,774
like killing somebody versus stealing a 
car versus walking like literally the 

1536
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:50,971
whole judicial system is based on what 
you did is your punishment.

1537
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:52,930
Your parents do that.
Right.

1538
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,300
You know what I mean?
You're bad was what you did.

1539
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,160
Yeah.
That's all.

1540
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,380
That's what that sounded like.
That.

1541
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:00,570
Yeah,
exactly.

1542
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:05,140
We live in a world now where I have to 
be measured in the way that I say that.

1543
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,970
What he said,
you know,

1544
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:11,880
affected me how I heard it.
And then also this is just a template,

1545
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,480
gold fucking bald,
white male.

1546
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:14,920
And they,
did they go in that route,

1547
01:04:14,921 --> 01:04:15,754
it's like you,
you literally sound like what the fuck 

1548
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:21,050
you're against and it's,
it's a,

1549
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,053
it's not gonna last and I feel like it's
like the end of the winter and people 

1550
01:04:26,231 --> 01:04:28,390
want to go outside and get some sun on 
their face.

1551
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:30,370
And you didn't like.
No,

1552
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:31,653
no,
like taking people by the back of their 

1553
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:36,184
fucking neck and fucking shoving their 
face in the shit that you can't sustain 

1554
01:04:40,991 --> 01:04:41,824
that.
No,

1555
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,930
you can't sustain.
It doesn't,

1556
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,813
it doesn't work.
You don't get people to change by 

1557
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:48,180
yelling at them.
It doesn't work.

1558
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,650
Bombing them like what the fuck we're 
doing with like,

1559
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,593
yeah,
that's not all you're doing is you're 

1560
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,870
just building up resentment and more 
people want to fucking take you down.

1561
01:04:55,871 --> 01:04:57,030
So that's.

1562
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,663
They don't understand psychology.
So what they think is this is their 

1563
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,240
time.
This is their time to get back at men is

1564
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:05,074
there their time to yell at men,
this is the time to where the future is 

1565
01:05:06,771 --> 01:05:07,604
feminine tee shirts.
There's a time to take their stand and 

1566
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:11,870
they will say,
did you not see the women's March?

1567
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:13,870
I saw a bunch of people walking.
Right?

1568
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,713
Listen,
I'm not saying the points that they're 

1569
01:05:15,861 --> 01:05:18,130
making don't need to be made.

1570
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:21,580
I'm not saying that their complaints are
not just.

1571
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:23,740
It's,
it's the execution of it.

1572
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:24,574
Yes.
Where it's like you're going to go 

1573
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:31,120
through intimidation and destroying 
people like exactly people's careers and

1574
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:32,650
people.
You have to publicly

1575
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,240
apologize.
It's so.

1576
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,330
It's like that's bullying people.
Yes.

1577
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:42,310
Some of the biggest bullies right now I 
can't believe it because I'm a lefty are

1578
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:43,144
on my side of the fucking fence and you 
know when someone's on your side of the 

1579
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:50,320
fence and you'll looking at him like you
sound like a fucking crazy person.

1580
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,090
That's when you've entered.

1581
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,540
What was your special strange times?
Weird.

1582
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,670
Yeah,
like it's like it is strange.

1583
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,173
It is strange because it's,
it's they feel like they're justified 

1584
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:04,120
because they feel like with the maniac,
like trump in the office,

1585
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:07,630
that they have to do what they have to 
do to change the world,

1586
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,150
but you don't change the world by 
yelling at people.

1587
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,013
It doesn't work that way.
And there's this real points to be made 

1588
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,140
is real points about.
I couldn't imagine being a woman working

1589
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:19,660
in an office with a bunch of guys trying
to fuck you all the time.

1590
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:23,440
It's got to be a goddamn nightmare.
I can't imagine having a bunch of bosses

1591
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,080
that literally tell you,
you suck my Dick.

1592
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:28,760
I'll give you a race that happens.
Yes,

1593
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,070
fucking.
It's got to be hell.

1594
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,430
I get it.
I mean,

1595
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:36,420
you got to be like an eight though.
Eight on up to deal with that everyday.

1596
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,600
I mean,
let's be fucking honest.

1597
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:38,421
You know what I mean?
There's really,

1598
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:40,600
there's really six is out there that's 
really good.

1599
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,140
If you've got a lot,
got a nice ass.

1600
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,830
Just say it.
You know,

1601
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:50,140
it's just like some of that shit is 
fucking,

1602
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,370
you know,
it's,

1603
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,240
it's.
I always viewed it like,

1604
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:59,780
like you ever watched like the behind 
the scenes of like a prison in the first

1605
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:00,614
thing every guy thinks is like,
how the fuck would I not get raped in 

1606
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:06,620
their exact women have to think that 
just fucking walking down the street.

1607
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:09,230
So that's how I wrap my head around to 
be like,

1608
01:07:09,231 --> 01:07:10,070
wow,
okay.

1609
01:07:10,071 --> 01:07:12,290
Like what they're saying is like,
because I don't

1610
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,070
like,
like

1611
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,080
one of the arguments,
not like that doesn't make sense.

1612
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:23,380
What doesn't make sense to me is the 
children of the corn torches burning and

1613
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,480
just go like,
um,

1614
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:31,250
the way that,
I mean a lot of people,

1615
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:34,400
they do that with like a,
our foreign policy.

1616
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:40,130
Like this whole fucking thing is 
bankrupted this country every August now

1617
01:07:40,131 --> 01:07:40,964
that just shut down the government which
has just become normal and all they do 

1618
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:45,770
to,
to make it like,

1619
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:46,903
okay is they just raised the level of 
debt that we legally can take on or 

1620
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:51,500
whatever.
And it's like,

1621
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:53,330
all right,
let's do this for another year.

1622
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:54,763
And if you question any of that,
that means you don't support the troops 

1623
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,520
and you're a fucking piece of shit.
You need to get the fuck out of here.

1624
01:08:01,521 --> 01:08:04,190
And it's like so much stuff doesn't make
sense to me.

1625
01:08:04,191 --> 01:08:05,460
Like I just saw,
um,

1626
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:06,423
Michelle Obama,
they had this fucking tweet of her 

1627
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:13,100
wearing these glitter thigh high boots 
and said sets twitter on fire with their

1628
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:15,170
$4,000
fucking boots.

1629
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,900
And it's just like,
you know,

1630
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:21,170
the top question where she got that 
money,

1631
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,800
the president makes 500 grand a year.
She blew four grant and thigh high boots

1632
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:31,210
and don't even talk to me about the 
fucking book deal and all of that shit.

1633
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,430
That fucking guy.
His first like to,

1634
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,520
you know,
public speaking engagement,

1635
01:08:36,521 --> 01:08:40,110
things were like with major banks and 
you go out on the road,

1636
01:08:40,111 --> 01:08:41,860
thousands of dollars and all these guys 
are like,

1637
01:08:41,861 --> 01:08:42,694
fuck it.
All these fellow Americans are upside 

1638
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:46,120
down in the house from those fucking 
banker comes who did not get,

1639
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,460
did not get punished in 2008.
They all see me.

1640
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:53,200
We'll talk about like people who should 
have their fucking lives burned down.

1641
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,650
Those people and these guys that they're
in,

1642
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:58,510
they have their faces in the same 
fucking pig trough.

1643
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:02,710
It's the guys with the red ties and for 
whatever reason,

1644
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:04,780
like

1645
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,490
I don't.
And I don't know why.

1646
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:10,060
Like they get a pass.
Exactly.

1647
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,790
It doesn't make any sense.
And then more serious shit.

1648
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,440
Like drone strikes,
more,

1649
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,840
more innocent.
Civilians were killed with drone strikes

1650
01:09:16,841 --> 01:09:18,490
during Obama's administration.
I know.

1651
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:20,260
And that's why they're telling me you 
fighting terrorism,

1652
01:09:20,261 --> 01:09:21,094
why you're creating more of it,
because all I would want to do is just 

1653
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:24,640
get revenge.
Exactly.

1654
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,500
And uh,
you know,

1655
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,620
I have

1656
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,390
plastic ways of how to get the fuck out 
of there.

1657
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,790
How do you do it?
Well,

1658
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:31,624
I mean,
I'm not saying the air would be cleaner 

1659
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:35,180
because I don't know what,
like when you throw a tesla battery into

1660
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:36,770
the fucking ocean,
what that does to it.

1661
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:37,604
I'm sure it's fucking horrible,
but I know that there are a one stop 

1662
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:42,920
shop over there in the Middle East.
They got oil and that's it.

1663
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,873
You know,
I always compare them member that kiosk 

1664
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,060
and like the South Shore Plaza in 
Boston,

1665
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:49,760
that was something,
it was a place called wickson sticks.

1666
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,500
All they did was sell candles,

1667
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:54,563
which just seemed like a really 
vulnerable business or pewter pot first 

1668
01:09:57,871 --> 01:10:01,450
they just sold muffins and then they 
started doing full breakfast.

1669
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,930
Well they'd like a pewter pot that just 
selling muffins.

1670
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,410
So if we stopped buying muffins and we 
had enough oil here,

1671
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,333
if we switch to solar power and all that
shit and all the windmills are ugly and 

1672
01:10:10,471 --> 01:10:13,320
I know it's probably just as much 
fucking bat on the environment,

1673
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:14,363
but what it does is it gets you out of 
there in bankrupts them and then they 

1674
01:10:17,461 --> 01:10:20,320
don't have the money to funnel through 
the Mos to,

1675
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,900
to,
to fund the terrorists.

1676
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:24,240
Well,
the United States is exporting oil now,

1677
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,690
which is crazy.
I mean we,

1678
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,060
we,
we have a lot of oil,

1679
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,830
right?
And especially through,

1680
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:30,203
you know,

1681
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,300
I'm just saying.
But if you ever suggested that.

1682
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,250
Yeah.
Which I think I just did,

1683
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,143
I think then for some reason I don't 
love my country and I'm trying to solve 

1684
01:10:39,181 --> 01:10:40,140
it.
I'm a frugal guy,

1685
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,290
you know,
I don't fucking know.

1686
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,480
I don't spend beyond my means and you 
know,

1687
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,850
uh,
I don't like debt and that type of shit.

1688
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:51,270
I don't know how the fuck these guys.
I think that's why the president ages so

1689
01:10:51,271 --> 01:10:53,120
much,
um,

1690
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,250
well then don't go to sleep.
The pressure you imagined,

1691
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:57,810
the dead bodies,
everything,

1692
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,660
all of that.
A pitch is knowing how everything really

1693
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:01,690
works.
Oh yeah.

1694
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,130
Trump doesn't seem to mind.
He just takes an extra adderall.

1695
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,083
Keeps on trucking.
He doesn't seem like he's all the 

1696
01:11:08,311 --> 01:11:09,144
scandals.
That guy seems completely because I 

1697
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:12,150
think he,
he's,

1698
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:16,960
he's a certain sick mentally that it 
doesn't.

1699
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:21,000
It doesn't get.
It doesn't get in because he hasn't aged

1700
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:21,834
at all.
Now granted he's got all that white 

1701
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:25,370
stuff around his eyes and he,
you know,

1702
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,000
I don't know what he's doing with the 
hair,

1703
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,550
but the hair is usually the telltale 
sign,

1704
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:32,880
but I think it's one of the only 
presidents that,

1705
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:33,714
you know,
it's like half of that shit's probably 

1706
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:35,634
from a doll,
like who knows where that got enough 

1707
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,450
money to do like a transplant at this 
point.

1708
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:39,600
Right.

1709
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,490
You can't do a transplant on that thing.
It doesn't have any.

1710
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,373
He doesn't have any donor area.
What do you mean he's got it all in the 

1711
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:45,840
back.
That's.

1712
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,520
No,
he doesn't ever see what happens when it

1713
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:49,260
flies up in the back.
When the wind hits it,

1714
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,680
the back's all balled.
All because he probably did the original

1715
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:53,514
plugs and they didn't take.
Who knows what he's got going on back 

1716
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:58,140
there.
He's got chaos going on back there.

1717
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,360
You ever seen it?
Yeah.

1718
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:03,060
I mean he's the president and his hair 
flops up,

1719
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:04,303
but you ever seen the video of him?
It looks like he's a guy wearing a 

1720
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:09,540
demon.
The demon mask.

1721
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,070
It's very wispy wispy like it's missing.
Look like,

1722
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,750
look like,
you know,

1723
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:18,780
it'd be nuts if he gets a second term 
and he shaves his head,

1724
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:19,823
that would be nuts and he would just 
look like the most evil fucking do 

1725
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:22,674
whatever.
Like that would be like if you've got a 

1726
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:24,684
second term shaves,
his head starts doing intermittent 

1727
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:28,350
fasting,
lifting weights gets on steroids,

1728
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,700
drops down to about a buck 90 jacked.
Yeah,

1729
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:33,563
I mean that would be.

1730
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,250
I think yeah,
it's definitely A.

1731
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:39,663
I don't know.
That's why I'm trying to just in my own 

1732
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:41,814
little fucking world,
I'm trying to chill out more and I'm 

1733
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:47,430
trying not to fucking uh,
there's just,

1734
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,013
there's enough yelling.
I don't think that they need it from me 

1735
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,324
now.
I think more mocking and laughing than 

1736
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:55,290
yelling for sure.
But when you see enough of those,

1737
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,083
the future is feminine tee shirts and 
you see enough hypocrisy and you see 

1738
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:00,504
enough people trying to take people out 
for commenting on what's sexist and 

1739
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:04,824
racist and trying to get people fired.
Like it's a time of outreach across the 

1740
01:13:07,891 --> 01:13:10,950
board and you have to respond a little 
bit.

1741
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,690
You have to let people know,
hey,

1742
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:14,780
this is fucking ridiculous.
Like there's.

1743
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:15,614
There's a certain obligation,
especially comedians have as a social 

1744
01:13:20,131 --> 01:13:20,964
commentator.
You see some stupid shit if you're not 

1745
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,350
commenting on it,
they're skewed.

1746
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,670
Choose to go that route.
Some people just like,

1747
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,103
I'm just going to let you forget your 
whole work week and I'm just talking 

1748
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,190
about a bunch of shit.
Small stuff,

1749
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,650
like a Seinfeld type stuff.
Yeah,

1750
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,130
I mean some people don't comment on 
anything that's controversial.

1751
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,380
Some people,
they'll go their entire career.

1752
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,040
But what I've always loved about 
Seinfeld is like if you really listen to

1753
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,300
him,
he has contempt.

1754
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,433
I said this on the comedians and cars.
He has contempt for like 90 percent of 

1755
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:51,450
the things.
This anger underneath this shit.

1756
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:52,284
Brian Regan's like that to Brian Reagan 
used to do that fucking bit about the 

1757
01:13:55,081 --> 01:13:56,700
cattle prod,
you know the walk,

1758
01:13:56,701 --> 01:14:00,820
run a walk stand line on the,
on the bucket,

1759
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:02,283
the moving sidewalk at the airport.
When he would act out the cattle prod 

1760
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:06,300
that he wanted to fucking do.
I was just like,

1761
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:07,800
there it is.
There it is.

1762
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,760
He's one of the nicest fucking guys 
ever.

1763
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,610
Brian Regan,
he is so nice.

1764
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:20,790
He's an unbelievable.
Just decent a fully formed human being.

1765
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:25,280
He really is a great guy.
He also knows when to get onstage,

1766
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,190
when not to get onstage.
If he's drunk,

1767
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:29,770
you won't get on stage.
The other day it was at the store.

1768
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:30,604
He was hanging around.
I had my show in the main room and I 

1769
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:32,681
said,
Brian,

1770
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:33,514
you went to a set.
He's like,

1771
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:37,600
thank you,
but I've had too much to drink.

1772
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:41,260
It was in the back bar.
Little bit split up and he just said,

1773
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,760
I just don't think it's a good idea.
Especially because he's got that squeaky

1774
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:47,110
clean act.
If he goes up there,

1775
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:49,390
there's fucking conc hey,
can't.

1776
01:14:49,391 --> 01:14:50,224
You just can't.
I've only twice in my life I've been on 

1777
01:14:52,491 --> 01:14:55,060
stage drunk once was an Ireland.
Oh,

1778
01:14:55,061 --> 01:14:56,430
that's a good place to be drunk.
Yup.

1779
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,420
And then the uh,

1780
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,680
that's not doing the kilkenny festival 
long time ago.

1781
01:15:00,681 --> 01:15:03,950
And then another time I had gone to a 
red sox yankees game,

1782
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,773
got drunk at the game.
I thought it was sober and somebody 

1783
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:09,530
texts me as I got back to the city 
going,

1784
01:15:09,531 --> 01:15:10,520
hey,
you want to do a spot?

1785
01:15:10,521 --> 01:15:12,080
You know,
I got off the subway one do a spot.

1786
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:12,914
It was like,
yeah.

1787
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:13,940
And I thought I,
you know,

1788
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:15,680
you know,
when you're so drunk that like,

1789
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:19,610
just drunk fill sober.
And I got on stage and I was just like,

1790
01:15:19,611 --> 01:15:22,940
oh shit.
And I really had to slow down.

1791
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:28,180
I was like slurring fucking always gone 
on people immediately.

1792
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,780
Everything I've learned as a comedian I 
was like,

1793
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:36,010
I like opened micro energy and the whole
crowd reacted that way and I had to kind

1794
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:38,690
of slow down and get it going.
I don't even think I did my time.

1795
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,330
I was like fucking sweat and my mouth 
was dry.

1796
01:15:41,331 --> 01:15:44,290
It was just like,
alright,

1797
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,420
that's it for me.
That was my closing bit.

1798
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,540
That's it for me.

1799
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,550
Yeah.
So I never did that again.

1800
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,140
Yeah,
it's a,

1801
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:55,470
anything that slows your brain down,
it's not the best.

1802
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,180
Yeah.
But a little buzz.

1803
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,730
It doesn't hurt anybody just a little 
bit.

1804
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,580
Uh,
I don't drink you like one drink.

1805
01:16:03,581 --> 01:16:06,030
You don't drink.
I know you don't like anything?

1806
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,750
No,
I don't actually,

1807
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:08,603
I have like a rule that I used to.
We used to have like a drink before you 

1808
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:12,560
go.
Never ever.

1809
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,370
Not even adult drink.
Nope.

1810
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,473
Never.
Did I think you did no confusing you 

1811
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:19,200
with somebody?
Maybe so.

1812
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,370
I know.
I'm like,

1813
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:22,770
I'm kind of just,
I don't know.

1814
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,150
I was,
I drank too much,

1815
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,163
you know,
I was just drink too much and then I 

1816
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:26,704
just take some time off.
So I'm just taking time off from booze 

1817
01:16:27,991 --> 01:16:31,170
and right now I know you got on a big 
diet kick for awhile.

1818
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,460
You've got down pretty light.

1819
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:33,703
Dania,
you go pretty heavy and then you lost a 

1820
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,320
ton of weight and he developed abs 
again.

1821
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,200
I got four out of the eight.
I got halfway there.

1822
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,380
Good.
I got halfway there and then uh,

1823
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:47,040
then I had a six week run on the road 
and it just fucking sucks,

1824
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:48,660
man.
I ate perfectly.

1825
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:52,010
I wasn't drinking for like two months 
now,

1826
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:57,050
almost three months and then six weeks,
six weeks and you just fucking,

1827
01:16:57,631 --> 01:16:59,370
you know,
it's just,

1828
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:00,720
it's just,
it's just not fair.

1829
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:01,763
It's not fair that there's no way in a 
healthy way to really lose like five 

1830
01:17:05,461 --> 01:17:07,830
pounds a week.
But you can easily put on six.

1831
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:10,280
No problem.
No fucking problem.

1832
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,320
Especially in like New York.
You could just fucking,

1833
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:13,723
you could do it.
You can lose five pounds a week if you 

1834
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:16,304
really have the weight to lose.
I was going to say like I was going to 

1835
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:20,080
say 10 because I knew you were going to 
debate.

1836
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,390
That sounds rough.
10 tenured dehydrating yourself,

1837
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:26,840
but you can lose five.
But I mean like not losing muscle mass,

1838
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:29,300
like just doing it the right way and 
you're going to keep it off.

1839
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:30,134
I'm not talking about some celebrity 
crash diet or I gotta make weight for 

1840
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:33,230
this fight.
I mean like,

1841
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,180
like legit.
Just how easy it is.

1842
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,083
Fucking New York City.
He had a couple slices of pizza every 

1843
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,520
fucking night.
After a night of drinking,

1844
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,380
you're of a certain age.
That's it.

1845
01:17:42,381 --> 01:17:43,214
Five pounds.

1846
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,650
All of a sudden you fucking slacks 
aren't fit in the way.

1847
01:17:46,651 --> 01:17:50,200
This boosting.
Yeah,

1848
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,310
I do.
You ever do intermittent fasting?

1849
01:17:52,311 --> 01:17:54,050
You know what that is?
Yeah.

1850
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,360
You ever try that?
Yeah.

1851
01:17:55,361 --> 01:17:56,194
It's called sleeping.

1852
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,240
I haven't eaten for eight hours.
It's supposed to wait 16 breakfast break

1853
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:05,970
fast.
Now I can do that.

1854
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:07,680
That's not.
Fasting isn't that hard.

1855
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:08,543
It's just the.
If you start at four in the afternoon 

1856
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:12,063
and then you know by the time you wake 
up the next morning you'd gone so long 

1857
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:17,550
that you're not even hungry anymore and 
then you kind of find and it's just that

1858
01:18:17,551 --> 01:18:20,490
first night and then you're already.
I know a buddy of mine does it.

1859
01:18:20,491 --> 01:18:20,940
He goes,
dude,

1860
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,290
I still work out.
I don't do anything.

1861
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,153
Goes.
I have this ridiculous amount of energy 

1862
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,370
and all this shit.
And I was just like,

1863
01:18:26,371 --> 01:18:28,620
I heard when you're fasting,
you're not supposed to do that.

1864
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:29,640
And he's like,
it's all bullshit.

1865
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,070
It's all bullshit.
You heard when you fast,

1866
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,460
you not supposed to.
What exercise?

1867
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:33,503
Yeah.
Like you're supposed to fucking be 

1868
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:34,854
chilling.
Nah,

1869
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,940
no,
you can exercise.

1870
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,283
You can definitely are.
Especially in a second non doctor to 

1871
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:42,270
tell me that I could do that.
So I'm waiting for someone with at least

1872
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:45,720
has a lab coat Halloween costume to tell
me that.

1873
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:49,680
I'll get dom d'agostino.
He's a guy that gets sad.

1874
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:50,820
Glad God said.

1875
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:56,670
We have a guy that's been on fasting.
I'd be like,

1876
01:18:56,671 --> 01:18:57,600
I'm sorry,

1877
01:18:57,601 --> 01:19:01,110
Rhyme.

1878
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,780

1879
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:04,550

If you name your kids,

1881
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:11,660

It's just,

1882
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:14,300
it's just not fair to you.
And she'll get zoucks is not a bad name.

1883
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,220
It's Kinda cool.
God zoucks.

1884
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:19,240
Remember that?
People would say that God souks.

1885
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,030
I was like a comic book type thing.
Like when people were stunned,

1886
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:26,940
I'd sit say [inaudible].
I would say steep.

1887
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,813
Yeah.
Lebanon.

1888
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,920
Common male.
Arabic name.

1889
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,890
Given the means a felicity.

1890
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,640
I know,
but do they fucking.

1891
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,430
If you're last name is sad,
do you have to name your Kid Gad?

1892
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,130
I just can't picture a part of the 
world.

1893
01:19:41,131 --> 01:19:41,964
Will you name fucking rhymes and you 
don't have to deal with that every time 

1894
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:44,851
I get.
Yeah,

1895
01:19:44,851 --> 01:19:45,900
I get it.
It rhymes.

1896
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:48,240
Can I have my fucking falafel?

1897
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,800
You want to talk to him?
He'll show.

1898
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,000
He'll do a show.
He's funny guy.

1899
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:53,823
You talked to him about that.
I don't have smart people on my podcast 

1900
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,150
ever.
You've never done it right?

1901
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,190
I did it once.
You did do it once.

1902
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,830
I make an exception that we did it at 
place.

1903
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:10,860
Okay.
Has it been that long?

1904
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,721
Yeah.
Yeah,

1905
01:20:11,721 --> 01:20:12,554
yeah.
Yeah.

1906
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:13,760
Well we did it.
No,

1907
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,800
we didn't do it at my house.
We did it at the studio if I recorded it

1908
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,173
or something like that.
Yeah.

1909
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,013
Okay.
Yeah.

1910
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:24,720
I like how you do a dump.
I T,

1911
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:26,360
I keep telling comics saying,
look,

1912
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,750
look,
Bill does.

1913
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:30,180
He doesn't need anybody.
He doesn't need anything.

1914
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,490
He's got a fucking recorder and he just 
rambles.

1915
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:33,563
Yeah.
That's great.

1916
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:35,700
Yeah.
That's because of my childhood,

1917
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:40,560
the way you just said that.
Anybody has anybody needed anything?

1918
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,700
He doesn't need anything.
Yeah.

1919
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,520
That's where I went and that was my 
protective place.

1920
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:46,710
I went mentally.
He just started talking to yourself.

1921
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,603
No,
I was just like,

1922
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,800
fuck everybody.
I don't need anybody.

1923
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:50,910
I don't give a shit.
I don't care.

1924
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,380
Which wasn't true.
I did care.

1925
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,360
I did care.
But you just say,

1926
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:56,100
I don't care.
I don't give a fuck.

1927
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:57,900
That's a pretty common thing amongst 
comics,

1928
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,950
don't you think?
No,

1929
01:20:58,951 --> 01:21:00,070
I think I'm unique.
Oh,

1930
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,133
interesting.
Now I guess it is a few guys that are 

1931
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:05,460
doing that now.
Like you though,

1932
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:08,310
like Theo von does his podcast,
very similar to the way you do it.

1933
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,150
He just rambles,
you know,

1934
01:21:10,151 --> 01:21:11,520
uh,
Dalea does it.

1935
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:12,960
Very similar.
Just rambles.

1936
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:13,794
But that's a great.
It's got to be a great way to develop 

1937
01:21:15,631 --> 01:21:16,710
material.
Like,

1938
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:17,544
come on,
try not to take too much shit from 

1939
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:21,420
there.
Uh,

1940
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,550
you know,
I answer questions and shit.

1941
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:25,970
I had my little fucking tent poles.
I got to get me through.

1942
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,910
But uh,
I,

1943
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:29,243
um,

1944
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,773
I don't know.
I guess it just started out as a way to 

1945
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:33,450
promote my dates and I would just talk,
Hey,

1946
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:35,360
what's going on?
I'd make a couple of jokes.

1947
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,290
I'm going to be with the punchline in 
San Francisco,

1948
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:38,011
but blah,
blah blah.

1949
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:38,844
And it was only like a minute long or 
two minutes long and then it just got a 

1950
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,840
little long and long.
I would tell some stories.

1951
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:47,160
I used to call in a service is how I did
it and it would record me on the phone.

1952
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:49,770
So I had my little flip phone and I will
remember those.

1953
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:50,613
Yeah,
like at an airport and talking on the 

1954
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:53,154
phone,
it was like a phone call and I will be 

1955
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,760
making fun of fat people and Shit.
They were walking by.

1956
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:00,600
How long were those then?
Those started to get to be 10 minutes,

1957
01:22:00,601 --> 01:22:02,720
15 and a half hours to the point it was,
you know,

1958
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,470
I,
I noticed I was talking on a cell phone,

1959
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:05,820
like my head felt like I was getting 
cooked.

1960
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,423
Um,

1961
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:11,320
and then,
you know,

1962
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:12,111
and then I started like,
oh,

1963
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:12,810
I need.
Oh,

1964
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:14,600
I'll answer questions.
And I had to think for a while,

1965
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:15,830
overrated.
Underrated.

1966
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:17,633
Um,

1967
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,820
then I had a segment,
is it racist?

1968
01:22:19,821 --> 01:22:21,800
But then somebody said tosh point.
Oh,

1969
01:22:21,801 --> 01:22:23,720
had something like that.
So I had to get rid of that.

1970
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:26,570
Uh,
yeah,

1971
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,100
just kind of did that.
Now I just,

1972
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,083
I dunno,
I just sit down sometimes I forget that 

1973
01:22:30,531 --> 01:22:31,364
I'm fucking

1974
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:32,783
talking to anybody.
Almost all those years had just been on 

1975
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:36,690
the road just talking to yourself in the
car.

1976
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:40,410
You talk to yourself on the road and 
your car.

1977
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:42,510
Really?
I listened to music.

1978
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:46,080
I fucking fantasize about being in the 
band as a big thing.

1979
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:46,914
When I listen,
I listen to music when I listen to a 

1980
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:50,453
music,
like you pick any fucking song and I'll 

1981
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:55,620
tell you who I am in the band during it.
Like I know you an hour Smith guy.

1982
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:57,600
Right?
So try and kept rolling.

1983
01:22:57,601 --> 01:23:00,810
I'm Joe Perry when he's fucking playing 
the guitar.

1984
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:03,540
And then when Steven sayings,
I'm Stephen,

1985
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,430
I'll do the whole fantasy.
I'm just like jumping around like,

1986
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:08,060
fucking I'm in Star Trek,
right?

1987
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,253
Uh,
and then when Joey Kramer does the 

1988
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:12,820
fucking,
the drum roll in the middle,

1989
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,940
that I'm joey and uh,
yeah,

1990
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:18,250
I just crush it.
It's just a whole fucking fantasy of me.

1991
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,350
Have you ever met those guys?
I met Tommy Hamilton.

1992
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:27,160
Joe Perry did my podcast.
He's a great guy.

1993
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,590
Great guy down to Earth.
Yeah.

1994
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:30,513
Ridiculous with them.
You like forget this is one of the 

1995
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:34,240
greatest guitarists of all time.
Yeah,

1996
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,430
all the riffs.
He wrote a regular dude.

1997
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,260
Steven Tyler.
I'm at one time.

1998
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,553
Yeah,
just all.

1999
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,510
Yeah.
I always like,

2000
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,510
um,
you know,

2001
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,353
just that whole band experience is very,
a lot like standup where in the 

2002
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:55,930
beginning you're doing these impossible 
gigs and you get like this,

2003
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,720
you know,
it's like you against them and even like

2004
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:00,850
as you came up as an open mic or the 
band was kind of the,

2005
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,110
the,
the class of open,

2006
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:02,944
Mike occurs and you'd go up there and 
you don't have to crowd got the better 

2007
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:06,880
you,
you'd like if you know,

2008
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,820
if your buddy told that person to shut 
the fuck up or whatever.

2009
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,500
I just liked that whole thing.
You know,

2010
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:12,810
like when I read that,
you know,

2011
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:13,733
when those guns and roses books about 
how their first Gig was in Seattle and 

2012
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:17,764
they had this van or something in a 
broke down and they just kept going and 

2013
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:22,264
they just were thiamine and they just 
somehow fucking got there at the last 

2014
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,430
second.
They just did the Gig.

2015
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,320
Um,
you know,

2016
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:31,121
I just,
and I also,

2017
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:31,954
I just would think it would be,
I think it was great feeling as a 

2018
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:34,774
comedian to turn the room around,
but to actually be in a band and 

2019
01:24:37,481 --> 01:24:38,314
fucking,
you know,

2020
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,273
you did it with somebody else.
You could actually share it with 

2021
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:43,540
somebody as opposed to you fucking doing
it by yourself.

2022
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,040
And then going back to the super eight,
you know,

2023
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,940
I love that you do those gigs where you 
get together early with Dean del Ray and

2024
01:24:49,941 --> 01:24:50,774
you guys play music and he sings.
Dean del Ray can sing his fucking ass 

2025
01:24:55,641 --> 01:24:56,271
off.
Dude.

2026
01:24:56,271 --> 01:24:57,820
He's good.
Like,

2027
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:58,580
he's really good.

2028
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,413
God,
he has all the fucking rockstar moves 

2029
01:25:00,771 --> 01:25:01,970
and shit.
He's fucking.

2030
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:04,960
Yeah,
we had a great time.

2031
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:06,680
Uh,
the clips he was showing you that was at

2032
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:08,000
the forum and then

2033
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,140
whole lot of rosy.
Yeah.

2034
01:25:10,141 --> 01:25:11,550
I was like,
Holy Shit.

2035
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:12,930
Yeah.
Like that is,

2036
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,790
he's got a fucking voice

2037
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,240
and we didn't tuned down.
A lot of times,

2038
01:25:17,241 --> 01:25:18,860
like when you go see a band you don't 
really notice,

2039
01:25:18,861 --> 01:25:19,694
but they tuned down half a step or a 
full staff and sometimes people can get 

2040
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:26,090
whey the fuck down on certain songs.
But he still,

2041
01:25:26,091 --> 01:25:27,920
I saw guns,
[inaudible] roses recently.

2042
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,770
Actually.
Give me some volume on acts.

2043
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:51,730
Here we go.
Debit on base.

2044
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:19,420
Awesome.
Cover might be a little slump,

2045
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:21,903
like you're a fun band together,
but you've got a legit professional 

2046
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:27,254
singer.

2047
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,310
Well,
that guy on base plays in whitesnake.

2048
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,233
That's Mike.
Devin.

2049
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,450
She's a Massachusetts guy now.
He's a fucking beast.

2050
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:34,743
He's a beast for some reason.
Everybody looks like they're playing 

2051
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:36,683
lefthanded there.

2052
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,880
I had a girl I did once.
It got in a car accident with her.

2053
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,490
Some old man ran a red light and slammed
into us.

2054
01:26:41,491 --> 01:26:42,720
And uh,
I uh,

2055
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:43,683
cargo total.
So they're taking the car away and I 

2056
01:26:45,331 --> 01:26:46,164
have a box in my cassettes in the car 
and she sees the white snake cassette 

2057
01:26:48,991 --> 01:26:51,000
and she fucking threw it away.
She's like,

2058
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:54,100
why are you still listening to this 
letter?

2059
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:56,310
I let it throw it away.
She must spend beautiful.

2060
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:58,740
She's pretty hot.
She was older than me.

2061
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:03,990
That's why 1988 chucked my fucking white
snake.

2062
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,930
Checked it out.
So sad.

2063
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,340
And because of that,
somebody sent me one.

2064
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:10,380
Is this still here?
Where is that?

2065
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:13,530
Somebody sent me a fucking white snake 
is set right in your office.

2066
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:18,780
Fucking told the story and set.
Sit around here somewhere.

2067
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:20,810
Someone's Wednesday here,
dude.

2068
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:23,680
I feel bad.
Oh yeah.

2069
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,240
That was first relationships.
The shit you fucking with

2070
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,790
tolerate.
It's amazing.

2071
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:30,620
I know,
I know.

2072
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,420
But sometimes a woman.
That was the thing.

2073
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:37,370
I was still kind of a boy.
She was a woman now she was 25 and she's

2074
01:27:37,371 --> 01:27:39,800
on her own for quite a while.
Oh yeah.

2075
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:42,500
I remember when I was 23,
I dated a 30 year old.

2076
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,670
That was not a.
That was not the way to go.

2077
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,790
Dave.
I think they treated you like a toy.

2078
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,730
Yeah.
And it was like,

2079
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,123
you know,
she had been through a bunch of 

2080
01:27:54,071 --> 01:27:57,520
relationships so she knew how to put up.
She knew how to post up in the thing,

2081
01:27:57,521 --> 01:27:58,450
so I was just like,

2082
01:27:58,510 --> 01:27:59,690
yeah,
he was ready for Ya.

2083
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:02,063
Yeah,

2084
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,390
it was fun.
She was cool and everything,

2085
01:28:04,391 --> 01:28:05,320
but it was just like,
yeah,

2086
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,000
it didn't work out.

2087
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:08,230
Yeah,
obviously.

2088
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,090
Yeah.
I felt like I was a dog.

2089
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:12,300
Like I was like,
I was like,

2090
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:13,360
she got a dog.

2091
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:17,420
No,
no chicks get a German shepherd.

2092
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:19,220
No.
Yeah,

2093
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:24,220
you were a German shepherd psycho.
Crazy back then to,

2094
01:28:24,781 --> 01:28:26,150
this is what I was.
I was still fighting,

2095
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,470
so it was like

2096
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:32,470
I was 21 and she was a graduated from 
college.

2097
01:28:32,601 --> 01:28:35,480
Grown woman,
had a job and a career

2098
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,690
like cds and she's like,
Oh fuck,

2099
01:28:37,691 --> 01:28:38,980
you know,
cassette tapes,

2100
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,533
cds in the car is in [inaudible] 88.
Did they know they did because I 

2101
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:44,890
remember a buddy of mine ate a buddy of 
mine.

2102
01:28:44,891 --> 01:28:47,470
He had the first one.
He had a Volkswagen.

2103
01:28:47,471 --> 01:28:49,540
Sure Aco that we thought was amazing.
Right.

2104
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:53,230
That was like a sports car and he had,
this might've been 89 though.

2105
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,610
80 nine or 90?
I can't remember.

2106
01:28:54,611 --> 01:28:57,040
That's kind of a blur back then so long 
ago.

2107
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,950
But he had like the uh,
they would like mountain,

2108
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:00,813
like you had almost like a man.
It wasn't like in the dashboard and it 

2109
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:07,830
would just sit on like the little 
console in the middle.

2110
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,800
So then the thing if you went over a 
bump it would skip.

2111
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:11,723
Ah.
And then they had like the big suitcase 

2112
01:29:14,311 --> 01:29:18,990
they'd put in your trunk in that way it 
holds like 18 fucking cds.

2113
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:20,130
Ed Changes.
Oh,

2114
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,990
look at this.
Is that it?

2115
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,810
Oh,
okay.

2116
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,170
Dad Discs and 84.
Wow.

2117
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,840
Well we were just out of high school so 
he didn't have the money.

2118
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:33,870
We thought he was rich.
He had a Volkswagen Scirocco oh,

2119
01:29:33,871 --> 01:29:37,140
it's in his car in 1984.
Wow.

2120
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,630
You know they had car phones back in,
like the sixties,

2121
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:42,890
that phones and cars.
Oh yeah.

2122
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,910
He had to be like the presidential 
level.

2123
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,740
Yeah.
Super fucking rich guy.

2124
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:47,913
Yeah.

2125
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,060
I'm surprised you don't have a flip 
phone.

2126
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,260
So I would do it.
I mean,

2127
01:29:55,261 --> 01:29:56,710
I don't,
but I like,

2128
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:02,010
I played my card games of spades and gin
rummy and shit like that.

2129
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,970
Whenever I'm in traffic now if uber or 
something,

2130
01:30:04,971 --> 01:30:05,804
that's how I get through traffic and I 
don't flip out because I just fucking 

2131
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:08,874
stare at my phone.
You don't listen to books on tape or 

2132
01:30:10,411 --> 01:30:12,240
anything like that?
No,

2133
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,060
I can't do that.
You can't listen to books on tape.

2134
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,253
I've never tried.
I just can't what would annoy me 

2135
01:30:19,651 --> 01:30:21,930
listening to the person trying to make 
it sound interesting,

2136
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:25,590
you know,
with the influx,

2137
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:31,700
with the inflections in the voice and 
stuff because I'm defensive.

2138
01:30:34,491 --> 01:30:36,080
I like,
this guy thinks I'm a fucking moron.

2139
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:38,943
And in 18,
62 data that happened that and just 

2140
01:30:43,031 --> 01:30:44,080
talking like that,
I'd just be like,

2141
01:30:44,081 --> 01:30:46,180
all right dude,
just fucking read it,

2142
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,630
read it,
read it like a bailiff,

2143
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,230
dude.
I remember,

2144
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:55,380
you know,
I have that reference because um,

2145
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:58,940
when I got busted for drunk driving,
the bailiff goes,

2146
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:01,220
this is what he said.
The good guy goes,

2147
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,770
pulled the defendant over approximately 
blah blah blah blah,

2148
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:05,750
you know,
chasing through two towns,

2149
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,501
you know,
whatever.

2150
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,570
And uh,
which I,

2151
01:31:08,571 --> 01:31:10,550
which was bullshit,
I anyways,

2152
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,580
I had a fucking 83 Ford ranger and the 
bailiff read the thing.

2153
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,520
He said,
uh,

2154
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:15,383
the arresting officer asked the 
defendant where he was coming from and 

2155
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:20,840
he stated fucking Boston.
And it was just like,

2156
01:31:20,841 --> 01:31:22,520
that's not,
that's what I said,

2157
01:31:22,521 --> 01:31:25,440
that's not the way I set it.
I was fucking wasted.

2158
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:26,780
He,
I was trying to remember.

2159
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:28,580
He said,
where'd you come from?

2160
01:31:28,581 --> 01:31:30,020
I was like,
fuck it,

2161
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:36,010
Boston fucking Boston.
I didn't want to get out of the car.

2162
01:31:37,331 --> 01:31:38,050
And I was like,
yeah,

2163
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:41,110
I wasn't a jerk.
But when the guy did the read,

2164
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:42,130
right,
he goes,

2165
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:43,840
we asked him where he's coming from.
He said,

2166
01:31:43,841 --> 01:31:46,430
fucking Boston.
And then I looked like a like,

2167
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:47,891
oh,
it's funny,

2168
01:31:47,891 --> 01:31:49,960
I was standing there,
there's was all these people mug people.

2169
01:31:49,961 --> 01:31:51,040
And they were like laughing,
like,

2170
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:51,903
oh,
this guy,

2171
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,560
this guy's sticking it to the man.

2172
01:31:59,640 --> 01:31:59,980
I got

2173
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,110
pulled over for drunk driving once,
but I wasn't drunk.

2174
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:04,720
I dropped my phone,
dropped my phone in the highway,

2175
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:08,090
reached down and grabbed my phone and I 
wiggled a little bit right.

2176
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:12,580
And I wasn't even reading my phone,
this is my phone was a treat my legs and

2177
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:13,414
it fell and I thought it was going to 
get underneath my accelerator and they 

2178
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:19,750
pulled me over and they made me do all 
kinds of crazy shit and I did it.

2179
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:21,520
I'm like,
I'm doing all of it.

2180
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:22,363
I'm like,
look at me.

2181
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,283
I'm sober.
And then they wanted me to take a 

2182
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,480
breathalyzer.
I'm like,

2183
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,063
okay,
why do you want me to take a 

2184
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:28,500
breathalyzer?
Like I don't,

2185
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,670
I don't want someone to trust your 
equipment.

2186
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:32,880
He just got done doing all the tests.
Like,

2187
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:33,730
look,
I'm doing,

2188
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:36,970
I'm on one foot and fucking pounds.
What do you need me to do?

2189
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:37,990
I can,
I can do it.

2190
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:39,420
Set up some cones.
Like,

2191
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:42,910
do you want to know if I'm drunk?
I'm not drunk.

2192
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:44,740
So why do you want me to blow in your 
bullshit?

2193
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:47,650
Like what's going on here?
And the cops,

2194
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,180
they greeted with me,
they let me go,

2195
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:50,381
right?
I said,

2196
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:52,120
look,
I'm a big supporter of police officers,

2197
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,313
big supporter of law enforcement.
I donate a do benefits whenever they 

2198
01:32:56,351 --> 01:32:59,620
come up and I'm sober and I'm sober,
you know,

2199
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,830
the best sec.
All my most of my friends,

2200
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:04,210
we all got busted for drinking and 
driving.

2201
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,044
The best one was a buddy of mine.
They read his practically four in the 

2202
01:33:09,461 --> 01:33:11,560
morning.
We noticed a Maroon VW,

2203
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:14,140
Fox blowing its horn,
trying to pass on the right.

2204
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:18,290
We pulled the defendant over afterwards

2205
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:21,070
repeatedly asking the defendant to stay 
in the car.

2206
01:33:21,071 --> 01:33:25,840
He got out of the car,
threw his keys at my feet and repeatedly

2207
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:27,130
stated,
lock me up.

2208
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:32,131
I'm fucked up.
And it was funny was my buddy was a good

2209
01:33:35,741 --> 01:33:40,741
looking guy and the judge was a,
was a woman and when the guy read that,

2210
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:45,880
you know,
locked me up and fucked up and he wasn't

2211
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:47,380
the brightest guy and he just Kinda,
when he went,

2212
01:33:47,381 --> 01:33:48,214
like,
he put his head down like that and he 

2213
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:50,354
was,
you know,

2214
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,470
little pound puppy fucking looking dude.
And she,

2215
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:54,304
uh,
she,

2216
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:57,220
she gave him like a lighter sentence 
because he was good looking.

2217
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:59,410
I think so,
yeah.

2218
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,293
I mean that all plays in it.
My ugly people are complaining so much 

2219
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,550
they won't take the time to develop a 
fucking personality.

2220
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,470
Right?
Some jokes do it.

2221
01:34:11,471 --> 01:34:14,410
The rest of us have to do like,
I don't get mad at Brad Pitt,

2222
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:15,733
you know,
have it be fucking because he's fucking 

2223
01:34:17,141 --> 01:34:17,974
beautiful.

2224
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:19,623
I'm a fucking bald redheaded mail.
I know where I am in the pecking order 

2225
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:23,773
and some of these fucking people who are
complaining right now who are mad that 

2226
01:34:28,601 --> 01:34:30,970
beautiful people get treated 
differently.

2227
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,510
I understand racially speaking,
but you're not going to do the beautiful

2228
01:34:34,511 --> 01:34:35,344
thing.
And then then that's another thing they 

2229
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:38,500
tried to say,
well society tries to,

2230
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:40,690
you know,
they're the ones that fucking dude like,

2231
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:42,640
you know,
like I love when there's a supermodel,

2232
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:43,474
like did this is like an impossible 
standard of beauty to try and live up 

2233
01:34:46,511 --> 01:34:47,344
to.
Yeah,

2234
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:48,970
yeah,
yeah.

2235
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:51,040
That's why she's on the cover of a 
magazine.

2236
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:52,023
She's that level beautiful.
And you're going to try and sit there 

2237
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,980
and tell me that that was learned.
But here's the

2238
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,910
thing that's only women,
because when you see Jason Momoa playing

2239
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:03,123
Aquaman,
you don't hear men say that's an 

2240
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:07,180
impossible standard of beauty that we 
have to.

2241
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,770
No,
I just make fun of that fucking stupid.

2242
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:10,604
That trying to hang onto.
I don't care how much you can kick my 

2243
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:17,210
ass.
That is the dumbest.

2244
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,970
She should be on a fucking serial box.
It's a change.

2245
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,820
For years they had a problem like with 
aqua man,

2246
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:26,210
it's like he's in the ocean.
Human beings are on earth.

2247
01:35:26,211 --> 01:35:26,791
Like,
what do we like?

2248
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:29,810
I have to see that fucking movie.
What are they going to be?

2249
01:35:29,811 --> 01:35:32,230
Is it going to be like Japanese people 
like fitting?

2250
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:35,120
He's sharp.
He goes under water.

2251
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:38,060
Is that a skin like.
Well the bumps.

2252
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:39,290
What is that?
Is that a suit?

2253
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:44,120
Doesn't water getting the gloves have to
be all one piece.

2254
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:44,954
Right?
It would be annoying as shit is any 

2255
01:35:46,131 --> 01:35:47,660
worse than water and your glove.
So look,

2256
01:35:47,661 --> 01:35:49,700
it looks like it catches them like a 
water catcher.

2257
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:53,000
Like not just like water gets in the 
gloves.

2258
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:53,834
It's like a funnel.
He looks like a stripper at a 

2259
01:35:55,191 --> 01:35:57,780
Bachelorette party.
Does a good one.

2260
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,110
She pays money.
You got a good one.

2261
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:02,470
Guy dieted down for that.
Um,

2262
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:05,810
yes he did and he got all the abs so 
he's been better than I am.

2263
01:36:05,811 --> 01:36:07,040
Oh,
you hit the button that says this is the

2264
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:08,010
fall.
Look for one.

2265
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:11,780
Yep.
This is when he's in the black seat.

2266
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:13,850
You know what I mean?
He wants to fucking gets cold.

2267
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:15,260
Yeah.
Did you see

2268
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:17,710
so going on in the UK,
the UK is banned.

2269
01:36:17,711 --> 01:36:22,711
Advertisements that feature unobtainable
bodies is a,

2270
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:25,570
I,
it recently,

2271
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,280
the way they eat fish and chips over 
there,

2272
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:30,790
that's going to be most of advertising.
Well they had these ads for summer

2273
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:31,551
bodies.
You know,

2274
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:35,450
you see a girl in a bikini and they're 
now making it illegal to

2275
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,353
aspire to that.
Like I look at that aqua man guy that 

2276
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:41,730
makes me want to go to the gym and I'll 
be like,

2277
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:43,270
Ooh,
he's good.

2278
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:44,393
Full head of hair.
Look like you got to make me feel 

2279
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:48,420
better.
It's because the people that complain,

2280
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:50,430
who are the people that are complaining,
that people to complain to,

2281
01:36:50,431 --> 01:36:52,830
the people that don't want to work to be
that lady,

2282
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:55,440
they don't want to work to get that kind
of a body and they want to.

2283
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:58,080
They just want to not see it.
They don't want any.

2284
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,340
They don't want to go to the subway and 
see a body that they never got it.

2285
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,050
Yeah.
I saw,

2286
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:04,670
I saw an actress complaining one time 
because the studio total that she needed

2287
01:37:04,671 --> 01:37:09,500
to lose 15 pounds and like you can't 
drop 15 to star in a movie.

2288
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:10,590
I mean,
what,

2289
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:13,400
what Karen.
Can they specifically carrots?

2290
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,533
Some veggies in your diet.
What do they have to dangle in front of 

2291
01:37:17,091 --> 01:37:18,980
you to go to the fucking gym?
Like the rest of us,

2292
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:21,350
like I literally like because I say,
Oh guys not to deal with that.

2293
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:21,651
It's like,
yeah,

2294
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:22,760
we do.
Of course.

2295
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:24,170
Yes,
we do have to deal with that.

2296
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,033
I gained 20 pounds to forget about him.
If just having five lines in a fucking 

2297
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,233
movie.
If I am north of 171 72 pounds to 

2298
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:34,520
fucking tweets,
I get a belly booze bag.

2299
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:38,450
Hey Billy Bitch tits.
Hey Fat,

2300
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:39,284
freckles.
All of this shit that I get like I know 

2301
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,950
like they,
they sit there and they had like a.

2302
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:45,243
they're acting like,
like fucking preteens where everything 

2303
01:37:47,871 --> 01:37:51,830
is just everything's about them and the 
whole fucking world gives a shit.

2304
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:53,143
Celebrities what they're fucking 
political views is the funniest thing 

2305
01:37:55,561 --> 01:37:56,100
ever.
It's like

2306
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,000
all you're,
you're not,

2307
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:00,540
you're not making anybody changed their 
mind politically.

2308
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,910
I think that any of that back in up,
it's like,

2309
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:03,744
no,
you can't have the spotlight on you 

2310
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:05,694
enough.
That's all you're doing because all 

2311
01:38:06,751 --> 01:38:08,880
you're doing with that bullshit is your.
First of all,

2312
01:38:08,881 --> 01:38:11,490
you're alienating half the fucking 
people that are going to go see whatever

2313
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:13,500
the fuck you are in.
And then secondly,

2314
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:14,423
you're just getting on the radar of 
lunatics in white vans with two seats 

2315
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:20,760
that are looking up how to fucking build
pipe bombs like that.

2316
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:22,410
That's,
that's the fallout.

2317
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:26,370
It's like a jerk when he goes to average
run of the mill,

2318
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:28,380
son of a bitch.
And already picked Steve Martin,

2319
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:31,630
the idea that a girl shouldn't be asked 
to lose weight,

2320
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:33,850
to look hot for movies.
Fucking crazy,

2321
01:38:33,851 --> 01:38:34,684
because that's what you're playing.
You're playing a hot woman and there's 

2322
01:38:36,871 --> 01:38:37,540
part of the job

2323
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:39,550
and there's millions of everybody's in 
shape.

2324
01:38:39,551 --> 01:38:41,500
I remember fucking CNI still a bit about
this.

2325
01:38:41,501 --> 01:38:46,501
I saw a Ben Stiller in,
in meet the fockers or something.

2326
01:38:47,591 --> 01:38:50,230
There was a scene where he had to have 
his shirt off in the pool.

2327
01:38:50,231 --> 01:38:54,430
He had fucking abs.
Then a comedy because that's because you

2328
01:38:54,431 --> 01:38:56,770
were seeing the influence of,
for the fucking Internet.

2329
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,790
You know what I mean?
It's like,

2330
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:00,520
you know,
he gets in your head,

2331
01:39:00,521 --> 01:39:04,000
people just fucking trash and you like,
I already knew I was unsightly,

2332
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:04,834
but I didn't realize how many things 
that people didn't enjoy it until I got 

2333
01:39:08,171 --> 01:39:08,921
on the Internet.
I was like,

2334
01:39:08,921 --> 01:39:11,110
wow,
I never noticed that about myself.

2335
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:12,510
So,
um,

2336
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:14,200
yeah,
I don't have a look.

2337
01:39:14,201 --> 01:39:16,810
If somebody really has like a fucking 
eating disorder,

2338
01:39:16,811 --> 01:39:17,890
you know,
I feel like fucking obese.

2339
01:39:17,891 --> 01:39:19,930
I have separately for those people.
But you 15 pounds,

2340
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:24,730
20 pounds fucking and you know,
did he drink some fucking smoothies?

2341
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:28,290
These women that are playing these roles
have to understand first of all,

2342
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,153
that part of the reason why you got that
role is not just because of your acting 

2343
01:39:31,051 --> 01:39:32,610
ability,
but also because you're pretty.

2344
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,920
You have a beautiful face,
you were born with it,

2345
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:35,783
you didn't even work at it,
and then on top of that you're supposed 

2346
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:39,810
to be playing a beautiful person in the 
movie.

2347
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,280
They would like you to not be fat.

2348
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:42,843
Well,
there's also discrimination is millions 

2349
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:45,673
of dollars at stake there could be lost.
So I always feel like your job is even 

2350
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:52,700
if you look like me,
is to show up on time knowing your lines

2351
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:56,400
in the best possible shape you could get
yourself in that.

2352
01:39:56,401 --> 01:39:59,290
That's the role that I.
even if I'm just fucking playing

2353
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:01,260
Lang,
what if you're already laying in the.

2354
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:02,094
You're supposed to play the guy that 
smoking cigarettes and you're the 

2355
01:40:03,641 --> 01:40:05,200
brother in law that's drunk all the 
time.

2356
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,960
Then your job's to look that way.
Jobs look that way.

2357
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:10,990
Her job is looking at the hot woman that
everybody wants to fuck.

2358
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:13,360
If they're telling you you have to lose 
weight and you're,

2359
01:40:13,361 --> 01:40:14,194
you're a beautiful woman,
it's because they want to make you more 

2360
01:40:15,731 --> 01:40:18,310
attractive.
It's not like discrimination.

2361
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,740
There's a reason they want a better 
product and you want to make money.

2362
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,083
What?
I try to get a better product and I'll 

2363
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:28,510
tell you nothing to like really those 
both male and female,

2364
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:30,250
like those beautiful people at that 
level.

2365
01:40:30,251 --> 01:40:32,310
It's like they're fucking aliens.
Like I,

2366
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,380
I've done a couple of movies.
I did a movie one time and I remember,

2367
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:36,303
uh,
it was a scene we were in a car in the 

2368
01:40:38,621 --> 01:40:41,110
star of the movie was holding onto the 
steering wheel.

2369
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:42,400
And I was like,
like,

2370
01:40:42,401 --> 01:40:44,470
I never thought this ever bought a 
woman.

2371
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:46,990
I was like,
her forearms are gorgeous.

2372
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:52,690
I was looking at me like I was like,
those forearms are,

2373
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,350
but I didn't make me.
When I went to Stockholm,

2374
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:58,870
Sweden,
how beautiful the people were that I was

2375
01:40:58,871 --> 01:41:00,880
running down the street pointing guys 
with my wife.

2376
01:41:00,881 --> 01:41:02,320
Go near,
look at that guy.

2377
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,910
Look at that.
That fucking guy,

2378
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:06,700
like he's like an accountant walking 
down the streets like does he know if he

2379
01:41:06,701 --> 01:41:07,534
fucking came over here,
he'd be starring in movies and that's 

2380
01:41:10,271 --> 01:41:11,104
not all the Sweden by the way.
That's like just when you're in 

2381
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:14,230
Stockholm,
that's like their Manhattan,

2382
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,890
so all the beautiful fucking people.
But I mean I went into a couple.

2383
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:17,733
I went to this magnet pipe,
went and bought like a magazine or 

2384
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:21,184
something like that when I was over 
there and the woman behind the counter 

2385
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:28,450
was like a fucking 11 here,
but she was working at a magazine stand.

2386
01:41:28,451 --> 01:41:30,130
So that was her energy.
Like,

2387
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:31,050
hey,
how you doing?

2388
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:35,950
I'm working in a magazine stand.
My dream hasn't come true yet.

2389
01:41:35,951 --> 01:41:38,210
And you just look at him like you.
You could sign

2390
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:41,270
the WHO's that big model or agents?
Yeah,

2391
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,133
like that all.
Like Cindy Crawford and all them are 

2392
01:41:43,221 --> 01:41:45,050
with back in the day,
the Vikings,

2393
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,680
it's Viking blood.
They the best looking people.

2394
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:48,543
They,
they went over there and raped and 

2395
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:52,130
pillaged and all that good DNA is left 
there.

2396
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,770
They cut the best women that kept them 
alive.

2397
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:56,540
Killed everybody else.
Oh,

2398
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:57,590
is that what happened?
Huh?

2399
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,210
I don't know what happened.
Biking,

2400
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:03,170
so that's why they're so big.
Beautiful.

2401
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:04,661
Oh yeah.
No,

2402
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:06,650
that's super helpful.
That's one of the funniest things ever.

2403
01:42:06,651 --> 01:42:10,010
When you go over to like the,
what do they call those?

2404
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:13,280
The Nordic in Scandinavia is within the 
Nordic countries.

2405
01:42:13,281 --> 01:42:15,260
I always have to remind myself that like
you'd go over there.

2406
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:17,510
It was the funniest fucking shit because
it's so god damn tall.

2407
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:22,640
There would be kids almost my height 
whose voices hadn't changed yet and they

2408
01:42:22,641 --> 01:42:24,620
had the mentality of like an 11 year old
and a like,

2409
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:30,650
except they was speaking that aged out 
if we're talking to boys that and change

2410
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:33,210
that.
And I was just sitting there laughing my

2411
01:42:33,211 --> 01:42:35,340
ass off because he's like fucking.
Yeah,

2412
01:42:35,341 --> 01:42:36,400
they like,
everybody was like,

2413
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:36,540
like

2414
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,530
a,
like six,

2415
01:42:38,531 --> 01:42:39,520
three,
six,

2416
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:41,530
four,
six,

2417
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:44,580
five,
like rail thin with their fucking shit.

2418
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,140
European pants.
Um,

2419
01:42:47,141 --> 01:42:48,450
I'm actually going over there.
Come on,

2420
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:51,940
I'm stuck Stockholm next year,
but I'm going over to Europe.

2421
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:53,950
I got that.
I got to run a 10,

2422
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:57,790
10 days over there.
So you're doing a European tour when you

2423
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:58,624
do that with three legs of three legs.
So you do three separate trips of 10 

2424
01:43:01,271 --> 01:43:02,350
days.
Wow.

2425
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:03,603
Yeah.
Just because I meeting the family or do 

2426
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:06,040
you just go solo?
Uh,

2427
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,933
I'm going to bring the family on one of 
them and then the other ones I'm only 

2428
01:43:09,161 --> 01:43:09,994
gone for a little over a week,
which is a really long time when you 

2429
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:14,080
have a kid and it.
And it's not something that uh,

2430
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,423
I look forward to doing now.
But it's something that it's also gives 

2431
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:20,670
my kid a great life.
So that's how I justify it.

2432
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:21,513
So then I also,
I had to move some shit around to work 

2433
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:25,950
less in other areas.
But um,

2434
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:28,450
that's a good balance.
I'm glad you approach it that way.

2435
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,190
You know,
I have friends that don't,

2436
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:30,820
they,
you know,

2437
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:33,830
they're on the road all the time and 
they have kids and you know,

2438
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:36,250
there are ideas that this is what I got 
to do to make a living.

2439
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:39,250
I'm like,
I guess so,

2440
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:42,340
but you know,
30 days in a row it's kind of crazy.

2441
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:45,940
I put my kid down for a nap and like,
I'll be downstairs for like 20 minutes.

2442
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:46,721
I looked at my wife,
I'm like,

2443
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:47,554
dude,
I miss her.

2444
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,570
It's just,
it's so quiet.

2445
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,190
She's hilarious.
She's hilarious.

2446
01:43:52,191 --> 01:43:55,070
So it's just like a,
you know.

2447
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,060
Um,
yeah.

2448
01:43:56,061 --> 01:44:00,080
And she's an unbelievable sense of humor
and uh,

2449
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:01,940
yeah.
And like she would love it.

2450
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:05,180
Yeah.
And I always wanted to be and I just was

2451
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:07,190
afraid of commitment and all that shit.

2452
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:09,650
So I waited.
I waited too long.

2453
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,060
I did wait too long.
So,

2454
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:14,660
which is why I'm going to take a fucking
sauna with you at the end of this.

2455
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,140
We'll take us on now.
Yeah.

2456
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:17,750
And I want to learn all,
you know,

2457
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:18,773
ge would be really be great if there was
a company out there that could somehow 

2458
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,180
let me know.
I get a sauna in my house.

2459
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,820
Um,
well sauna people out there.

2460
01:44:25,821 --> 01:44:29,750

2462
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:33,494
Okay.

2463
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:38,570
do something in my fucking house in this
asshole.

2464
01:44:38,571 --> 01:44:40,880
Drop the ball and it's not returning 
emails anymore.

2465
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:46,450
So I need a new sonic company to.

2466
01:44:46,451 --> 01:44:48,260
Where's the fucking sauna?

he hasn't gotten back to us.

2469
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:53,870
Let me get the fuck them two weeks.
Should we get back to him again twice?

2470
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:57,400
Got Back to this guy like trying to get 
the fucking song installed in the house.

2471
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:58,860
I love all those guys.
Stuff like that.

2472
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:01,340
They like Comedians,
like they don't want a real job.

2473
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:02,270
Contractors.
Oh yeah.

2474
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:05,180
Oh the gate guy that's on a guy that,
this guy,

2475
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:07,100
that guy,
they all got their little fucking in the

2476
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:09,530
handyman guys.
Um,

2477
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:10,813
well I grew up with those guys because 
my dad was an architect so I did 

2478
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:16,940
construction from the time I was in high
school all throughout the summer.

2479
01:45:16,941 --> 01:45:17,774
I was always doing side jobs.
I always had jobs on construction sites 

2480
01:45:20,961 --> 01:45:23,510
as a laborer.
Carpenters assistance.

2481
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:25,670
I was always around those guys.
I tried to do that.

2482
01:45:25,671 --> 01:45:27,600
I lasted eight days.
I just,

2483
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:28,483
with my fucking fair skin.
We were doing roofing and July and it 

2484
01:45:31,341 --> 01:45:31,760
was just.

2485
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,170
I just remember my job was I was putting
in the scaffold and going around,

2486
01:45:36,171 --> 01:45:38,000
you know,
when you fucking drill the hole,

2487
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:41,060
then you put the triangle thing and then
you fucking put the bolt on.

2488
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:42,560
This Irish guy kept going,
billy,

2489
01:45:42,561 --> 01:45:43,394
you must work quicker,
you much more quickly because what kept 

2490
01:45:44,811 --> 01:45:47,990
saying to me and I finally stuck my head
out the side of the house.

2491
01:45:47,991 --> 01:45:48,561
I was like,
dude,

2492
01:45:48,561 --> 01:45:51,380
I've done this for three days.
If you want me to fucking go quicker,

2493
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:52,813
you know,
we would like literally three stories 

2494
01:45:54,021 --> 01:45:55,730
up.
And he finally shut the fuck up.

2495
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,640
He must be a non union guy.
Uh Oh yeah dude.

2496
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:00,470
I remember there was a fucking guy on 
the site,

2497
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:01,304
I swear to God,
he wore the same fucking jeans everyday 

2498
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:05,130
with like no underwear.
Right?

2499
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:09,890
And it had a fucking giant fucking hole 
right here on his thigh.

2500
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:11,983
So I'm in fucking working in the house 
and I just remember he stepped over 

2501
01:46:15,441 --> 01:46:19,280
something with this left leg in the 
whole fucking whole moved,

2502
01:46:19,281 --> 01:46:21,680
right?
Just like flashed his fucking junk.

2503
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:25,850
I was just like.
And I did not stand up to people.

2504
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:27,163
And Plus Elsie and I was the new guy on 
the thing and I just was wanting to be 

2505
01:46:29,871 --> 01:46:31,040
like,
buddy,

2506
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:32,443
how about you put on some fucking boxers
or something so I don't get to look at 

2507
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:36,230
your fucking job.
First of all,

2508
01:46:36,231 --> 01:46:38,600
he's walking around with like a Goddamn 
nail gun now.

2509
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:42,620
Like boxers could stop that,
but any extra layer of clothing that you

2510
01:46:42,621 --> 01:46:43,454
could have.
This guys literally like his fucking 

2511
01:46:44,961 --> 01:46:45,461
Shit,
you know,

2512
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:46,910
like an hour.
We'll look it out of a tree

2513
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:55,290
and it's burned into my head.
I could pick his junk out of a lineup.

2514
01:46:57,070 --> 01:46:59,110
That was the first time I ever 
encountered alcoholics.

2515
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,333
I didn't know really know about 
alcoholics until I started working on 

2516
01:47:02,321 --> 01:47:05,680
job sites and I realized that there was 
guys that just had a drink your drink at

2517
01:47:05,681 --> 01:47:08,080
lunch that was drinking all the time and
they were always trying to quit.

2518
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:09,910
I remember one guy who was like,
I'm quitting,

2519
01:47:09,911 --> 01:47:11,260
I'm done.
And I remember thinking,

2520
01:47:11,261 --> 01:47:12,970
that's good.
You got your shit together,

2521
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,930
you know,
I was 15.

2522
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:14,411
I was like,
oh,

2523
01:47:14,411 --> 01:47:15,730
that's awesome.
Yeah,

2524
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:18,820
two weeks later,
fucking can of beer on the job.

2525
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:20,130
I was like,
oh,

2526
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:21,510
I just remember I couldn't.
Yeah,

2527
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:24,260
I couldn't eat enough.
I was always hungry.

2528
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:27,570
Pack two sandwiches,
three sandwiches and he just put like,

2529
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,440
like you were the most real world 
content.

2530
01:47:30,441 --> 01:47:32,060
Yeah,
that's what people used to do.

2531
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:34,400
No,
those were like those guys.

2532
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:38,390
I mean I would come home like it was 
like I went to football practice.

2533
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:39,440
It was just,
it just,

2534
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,370
I,
I,

2535
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:42,260
I,
if I stuck around for another month,

2536
01:47:42,261 --> 01:47:44,330
I could've gotten construction workers 
shape.

2537
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:46,400
I was,
but I just sucked at it.

2538
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:47,293
I just didn't have it.
And then that was one of the things how 

2539
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:51,464
I was able to figure out what I was good
at was one of my best attributes is I 

2540
01:47:55,221 --> 01:47:59,030
knew when I sucked at something like 
take playing drums and I wanted to be an

2541
01:47:59,031 --> 01:48:02,120
abandoned anything.
I just went to too many music stores and

2542
01:48:02,121 --> 01:48:02,954
I'd see some seven year old kid and just
him starting to play or picking up a 

2543
01:48:06,501 --> 01:48:07,334
guitar.

2544
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:08,570
I just knew it.
I was just like,

2545
01:48:08,571 --> 01:48:10,940
I don't have that.
I don't have that gift,

2546
01:48:10,990 --> 01:48:11,823
you know?
Even if I played better than just the 

2547
01:48:12,891 --> 01:48:15,170
ideas that they were already coming up 
with,

2548
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:16,413
um,
speaking of which do I should have 

2549
01:48:16,731 --> 01:48:17,564
called you the other day,
I saw Dave Nevara does this thing with 

2550
01:48:20,091 --> 01:48:20,924
his band royal machines.
It's like they just do this Christmas 

2551
01:48:23,091 --> 01:48:24,480
show every year.
And uh,

2552
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:27,200
and went with Ben Bailey the other night
at the El Rey.

2553
01:48:27,201 --> 01:48:29,750
Do what a fucking show these guys put 
on.

2554
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:32,900
Like Sebastian Bach came out and sang 
highway to hell,

2555
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:35,540
fucking murder.
Do Juliette Lewis,

2556
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,500
you know,
from fucking American.

2557
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:39,610
Uh,
uh,

2558
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:40,690
what the fuck was that?
All the,

2559
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:41,693
all the edits,
the serial killer movie with Woody 

2560
01:48:44,930 --> 01:48:45,763
Harrelson.
Know what the fuck was that after going 

2561
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,220
natural born killers.
Although you know,

2562
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:50,930
all of those fucking moved dude,
you know,

2563
01:48:50,931 --> 01:48:53,390
some people like I'm a comedian who 
happens to play drums.

2564
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:54,223
Dude,
she's a fucking Rockstar who happens to 

2565
01:48:56,511 --> 01:48:57,640
act really?
Dude.

2566
01:48:57,710 --> 01:48:59,450
Oh my God.
Really?

2567
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:02,900
Oh my God.
It was so ridiculous.

2568
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,270
I was just laughing how fucking amazing 
she was.

2569
01:49:05,271 --> 01:49:08,570
She sang like Van Halen aint talking 
about love.

2570
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,613
And then she sang dirty deeds and it was
all just in the wheelhouse of Shit that 

2571
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:13,844
I listened to and I want to say she did 
one more and then in the end she did 

2572
01:49:16,911 --> 01:49:20,420
like a fucking forward somersault into 
the fucking crowd.

2573
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:22,460
Whoa.
It was just fucking.

2574
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,980
Is there video this?
Um,

2575
01:49:24,981 --> 01:49:26,330
I dunno.
I was,

2576
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:29,330
you know,
the band was so fucking good.

2577
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,690
And then the drummers they had,
I was Josh Freese,

2578
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:35,210
Chad Smith and Brad Wilk,
like,

2579
01:49:35,211 --> 01:49:35,850
so,
you know,

2580
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:36,683
if you're into dramas,
that's just recent fucking play with 

2581
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,790
everybody.
Literally everybody,

2582
01:49:40,850 --> 01:49:41,683
uh,
Brad Wilk was in rage against the 

2583
01:49:45,681 --> 01:49:48,100
machine and uh,

2584
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,083
and Chad Smith is in the chili peppers 
and those guys would just fucking 

2585
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,940
destroying.
And um,

2586
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,330
who they had steve Stevens for,
billy idol's band was out there.

2587
01:49:58,331 --> 01:49:59,740
All these fucking guys.
It's just like,

2588
01:49:59,741 --> 01:50:00,440
wow.
Yeah.

2589
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,860
If you get a chance they will kind of 
talk.

2590
01:50:01,861 --> 01:50:03,460
And like it was the last year they were 
going to do what?

2591
01:50:03,461 --> 01:50:04,294
I hope it isn't.
But Mark Mcgrath also was there who was 

2592
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:09,070
fucking hilarious.
He sort of like the like,

2593
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:09,910
you know,
you know,

2594
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:13,450
he sings the songs great,
but he's also like sort of the emc slash

2595
01:50:13,451 --> 01:50:14,770
comedian.
He's a really,

2596
01:50:14,771 --> 01:50:17,500
really naturally like funny guy.
Like he,

2597
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,720
I would say with another comedian,
he was cracking us up.

2598
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,060
He went on to be like an entertainment 
reporter.

2599
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:22,930
Right?
Yeah.

2600
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:25,680
Well the thing about him is he's like,
he was either,

2601
01:50:25,681 --> 01:50:29,470
I feel like he was always like a self 
deprecating.

2602
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:30,280
Yeah.

2603
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:33,130
Like he was writing hit songs,
like who the fuck can do that?

2604
01:50:33,131 --> 01:50:36,610
And he nicknamed an album like 1459,
like making fun,

2605
01:50:36,611 --> 01:50:37,444
like my 15 minutes are almost like he 
was like roasting himself while he was 

2606
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:43,630
just writing one hit after another,
after another.

2607
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:46,110
And uh,
I've gotten to meet him a couple times.

2608
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:49,930
He's like one of the fucking great 
people that I've met in this business.

2609
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,920
Yeah Dude.
And he's a fucking riot.

2610
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,600
He's a fucking funny.
Yeah.

2611
01:50:55,601 --> 01:50:57,070
So if you get to see guys like that and 
you go,

2612
01:50:57,071 --> 01:50:57,904
why don't you just do stand up?
Why do you want to work these fucking 

2613
01:51:00,071 --> 01:51:02,710
gigs?
Working for entertainment television,

2614
01:51:02,711 --> 01:51:04,900
pretending to give a shit about some 
stupid sitcom.

2615
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:06,640
Just go do it.
Well,

2616
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:08,830
how much of a chance when people give 
them because Oh,

2617
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:11,140
you're the sugar ray guy.
Me Probably got enough shit,

2618
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:14,860
you know,
like he's just one of those really like,

2619
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:19,890
uh,
just this finally found some doing rage.

2620
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:25,703
That was funny.
So there's Navarro that I think that's 

2621
01:51:32,121 --> 01:51:33,470
Brad Wilk on drums,
whatever.

2622
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,530
But he was making fun of himself before 
he came out there because I forget who's

2623
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,940
following these go like,
I know,

2624
01:51:41,941 --> 01:51:42,774
I know now you got to listen to the 
Douche from sugary so it just totally 

2625
01:51:45,541 --> 01:51:46,374
makes fun of himself and his love is.
Then he goes up and he fucking murders 

2626
01:51:50,191 --> 01:51:50,770
it.
Wow.

2627
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:52,090
So it's just kinda like,
ah,

2628
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:55,030
I'm like,
he just reminded me of like a,

2629
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,893
like a comedian or whatever.
So you get to hang out with Juliette 

2630
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:59,670
Lewis?
Um,

2631
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:00,291
no.
I,

2632
01:52:00,291 --> 01:52:01,530
I,
I have before.

2633
01:52:01,531 --> 01:52:03,060
She's cool as shit.
I want to meet her.

2634
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:04,570
Oh,
she's cool too.

2635
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:06,930
We've gone back and forth online 
together.

2636
01:52:06,931 --> 01:52:10,170
I was trying to get her on the podcast a
few years ago when I dropped the ball.

2637
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:11,873
Oh,
well.

2638
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:12,813
I was always worried that people like 
that would worry that I just want to 

2639
01:52:15,601 --> 01:52:18,790
harp on scientology because she,
you know,

2640
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,570
she's like a crazy scientologists I grew
up Catholic,

2641
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,900
but what the fuck they did and still 
doing.

2642
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:26,670
Yeah.
No,

2643
01:52:26,671 --> 01:52:27,504
listen,
I hear you,

2644
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:31,950
but I think she's still active to get 
sensitive about that shit.

2645
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:34,410
I was thinking of going back to church.
Really?

2646
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,960
Yeah.
Just in my own way.

2647
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:39,240
How you can do it.
I'm going to go,

2648
01:52:39,241 --> 01:52:41,130
but I'm not going to listen to anything 
and I'll,

2649
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:43,050
I'll,
I'll stand up and sit down.

2650
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,130
You're to get mad if they use certain

2651
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:46,963
inflections.

2652
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,210
No,
but I'm just going to kind of go there.

2653
01:52:49,211 --> 01:52:50,410
It's just a place.
I don't know.

2654
01:52:50,411 --> 01:52:50,910
I,
I,

2655
01:52:50,910 --> 01:52:51,743
I went last year with my mother in law 
because she goes every weekend when we 

2656
01:52:55,331 --> 01:52:56,164
went for Christmas mass and they had 
like this New Orleans band and I was 

2657
01:52:58,481 --> 01:52:58,781
like,
dude,

2658
01:52:58,781 --> 01:53:00,880
if I had this every fucking week as a 
band sounded great.

2659
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:02,760
I would go.
But like I,

2660
01:53:02,761 --> 01:53:04,690
I did,
it just sort of reminded me of like,

2661
01:53:04,691 --> 01:53:07,720
I used to be a better person.
I was so jaded,

2662
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:09,340
you know,
I used to go every fucking week.

2663
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:13,300
You think you're jaded from not going to
church or just.

2664
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:15,500
I think you jaded just from knowing too 
much.

2665
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,240
Yeah.
And just,

2666
01:53:19,950 --> 01:53:21,790
you know,
it's just certain things just get out of

2667
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:22,331
control.
You know,

2668
01:53:22,331 --> 01:53:25,660
what it is is when you become an adult,
you have to be your own parent,

2669
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:27,101
which is weird.
Like,

2670
01:53:27,101 --> 01:53:28,600
hey bill,
it's time to go to bed.

2671
01:53:28,630 --> 01:53:31,210
Hey Bill,
lay off the booze and just the um,

2672
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,240
you know,
just certain things just kind of get out

2673
01:53:34,241 --> 01:53:35,500
of whack,
you know,

2674
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:37,270
almost like the mixer you life,
you know,

2675
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:38,133
something's up too high or too low.
And I just felt like going there 

2676
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:43,140
reminded me,
you know,

2677
01:53:43,141 --> 01:53:44,980
so it's a nice reminder for the week,
like,

2678
01:53:44,981 --> 01:53:46,060
hey,
you know how,

2679
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:48,250
but you're not be a for the next couple 
of days.

2680
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:50,560
That's what I get out of it.
I don't get like,

2681
01:53:50,561 --> 01:53:53,820
you know,
this guy walked on water and you know,

2682
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:55,450
this is the right thing,
you know,

2683
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:57,220
if you believe this,
you got to go to heaven.

2684
01:53:57,221 --> 01:53:59,320
And if you know,
if somebody believes something else that

2685
01:53:59,321 --> 01:54:00,560
go into all of that stuff,

2686
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,480
just silly.
That's the way you put it,

2687
01:54:03,481 --> 01:54:06,360
as a good way of putting it,
that you have to be your own parent when

2688
01:54:06,361 --> 01:54:08,910
you become an adult.
That's a great way of putting it because

2689
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:09,923
one of the things that you get from,
whether it's god or any kind of 

2690
01:54:13,111 --> 01:54:13,944
spirituality,
so you get this idea that something's 

2691
01:54:15,721 --> 01:54:17,820
bigger than you.
Something's higher than you.

2692
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,683
There's a higher purpose and you think 
about that instead of being selfish and 

2693
01:54:21,571 --> 01:54:22,100
just thinking about

2694
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:25,100
that's what it is.
You can get like a,

2695
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:27,590
you know,
being a comic,

2696
01:54:27,591 --> 01:54:30,290
not selling tickets is one of the most 
humbling things ever.

2697
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:34,060
And then once you start selling tickets,
you know,

2698
01:54:34,061 --> 01:54:34,894
you can kinda keep,
can kind of float away a little bit and 

2699
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:37,730
just like,
you know,

2700
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:40,790
like all the fucking bullshit that you 
had to go through,

2701
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:42,763
you know,
finding a flight you can afford and how 

2702
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:44,830
am I,
you know,

2703
01:54:44,830 --> 01:54:45,663
what fucking dirty cat hair car they're 
going to pull up in to take them to the 

2704
01:54:48,471 --> 01:54:50,540
comedy condo that was always cat hair,
right?

2705
01:54:51,330 --> 01:54:54,920
And then all of that goes away and then,
you know,

2706
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:55,754
you just have this free time and like,
what are you going to do with it and 

2707
01:54:59,001 --> 01:54:59,834
this free time and this privilege that 
you have and you can really go roman 

2708
01:55:03,201 --> 01:55:07,840
empire with it and fucking eat and drink
and smoke and be a f,

2709
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:09,770
you know,
and just be a jerk,

2710
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:12,680
um,
or you can,

2711
01:55:12,681 --> 01:55:14,000
uh,
you know,

2712
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:19,380
you can still be who the fuck be as much
as who you were or whatever or trying to

2713
01:55:19,381 --> 01:55:20,460
help somebody out.
I just,

2714
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:21,803
that's what it makes me think of when,
when I went like I was because I got so 

2715
01:55:24,361 --> 01:55:26,610
caught up in like,
this is bullshit that never happened.

2716
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:27,473
They made that up,
this is just people writing this book 

2717
01:55:28,531 --> 01:55:31,740
and I went totally the other way.
So now I'm coming in the middle.

2718
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:36,750
Like there's a reason why people do this
beyond trying to control people and make

2719
01:55:37,021 --> 01:55:39,210
money and power and all that.
There is,

2720
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:42,870
there is something to it.
So there's a benefit for the people that

2721
01:55:42,871 --> 01:55:43,660
have.
Yeah.

2722
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:44,493
Yes.
So

2723
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:47,220
that's kind of what I was going there.
It's humbling.

2724
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,220
It's kind of like what I left La and I'm
like never spoken to view again.

2725
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:53,610
And then I started going back and they 
felt it pulling me back like,

2726
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:54,390
hey,
you know,

2727
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:55,440
this isn't that bad.
I'm like,

2728
01:55:55,441 --> 01:55:55,891
ah,
fuck,

2729
01:55:55,891 --> 01:55:56,724
I kinda like it.
So I went back to church with my mother 

2730
01:55:59,101 --> 01:56:00,570
in law and I was sitting there going 
like,

2731
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:04,850
there's an aspect of this that I liked.
I liked the sense of community.

2732
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:07,620
Um,
you know,

2733
01:56:07,621 --> 01:56:10,200
I didn't mind the little pep talk that 
the guy gives her whatever.

2734
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:11,110
It would be nice

2735
01:56:11,110 --> 01:56:11,943
if I didn't,
didn't think if I wasn't suspicious of 

2736
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:15,634
them.
The problem with church is the problem 

2737
01:56:17,861 --> 01:56:20,170
with anybody that gets in any sort of a 
position of power,

2738
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:23,260
it's easy to abuse it.
So the have a guy who,

2739
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,153
a pastor that's not a creep,
that really cares and is really a good 

2740
01:56:28,121 --> 01:56:31,660
person and really wants to care about 
the community and really wants everybody

2741
01:56:31,661 --> 01:56:32,494
to do better and get better with life,
but isn't trying to buy a fucking Rolls 

2742
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:38,710
Royce like Joel Olsteen and live in a 
giant mansion.

2743
01:56:38,711 --> 01:56:39,460
It's like

2744
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:41,080
mega church.
It always goes.

2745
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:41,993
It always goes south.
It's absolutely love about Joel Osteen 

2746
01:56:44,761 --> 01:56:48,270
is he's an arena act as a preacher.
He's um,

2747
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:51,540
he bought the old place,
the old arena where the,

2748
01:56:51,541 --> 01:56:53,340
uh,
the Houston Rockets used to play.

2749
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,600
He bought it.
Yeah.

2750
01:56:54,610 --> 01:56:57,060
That's so much money that guy has.
And then he fills it up.

2751
01:56:57,350 --> 01:56:58,920
Yeah.
Well that was one them,

2752
01:56:59,010 --> 01:56:59,843
when the hurricane came,
people criticized him because he didn't 

2753
01:57:01,261 --> 01:57:04,980
open up his doors to all the folks who 
were displaced from their homes.

2754
01:57:04,981 --> 01:57:05,814
I was teasing them about that.
It's like you saw that electric blue 

2755
01:57:07,621 --> 01:57:08,880
carpet he put on anything.
What do Yo,

2756
01:57:08,881 --> 01:57:13,440
you fucking guys getting it all wet?
No,

2757
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:16,620
he does.
He has a sick ass look at that place.

2758
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,900
Maybe it's the curtain that I thought.
Yeah.

2759
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:22,920
I mean look at that fucking place.
Holy Shit.

2760
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:23,803
Yeah.
That looks like a dice clay special and 

2761
01:57:25,501 --> 01:57:28,500
all those people is thrown down.
All those people are paying to be there.

2762
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:29,873
Okay.
Is want to somebody out there scalping 

2763
01:57:31,771 --> 01:57:33,610
tickets.
I got to buy the alter.

2764
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:34,583
It was two ways

2765
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:35,543
it right.
One is these getting all those people 

2766
01:57:36,891 --> 01:57:39,050
together and there's a sense of 
community amongst all of them.

2767
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:43,820
And two is that guy's making a fuck load
of money and he's got so much power.

2768
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:45,730
No,
you and all those people just at your.

2769
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:48,190
But it doesn't mean you're necessarily a
bad.

2770
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:50,230
That doesn't necessarily mean he's like,
what?

2771
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:51,083
What can you do with it?
Which is getting the reason why I'm 

2772
01:57:52,871 --> 01:57:53,704
thinking,
uh,

2773
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,460
you know,
stopping in every once in a while.

2774
01:57:57,550 --> 01:57:58,383
Good spot.
Like they were doing that rock and roll 

2775
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:02,080
church thing for awhile.
There was a,

2776
01:58:02,470 --> 01:58:04,870
I remember one of my friends who's a 
producer,

2777
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:07,060
his assistant was,
she was lost.

2778
01:58:07,061 --> 01:58:07,894
She,
I think she,

2779
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:12,140
I want to spiritually or she was lost a 
lot of ways,

2780
01:58:12,141 --> 01:58:15,220
but she was doing this.
What's going on Jamie?

2781
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:20,480
Price for what?
Four thousand $950 for the author to.

2782
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,730
Do you want to go?
What the fuck?

2783
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:25,490
Yeah,
we could do that with 1,400

2784
01:58:25,491 --> 01:58:26,021
bucks.
No,

2785
01:58:26,021 --> 01:58:26,240
no,
no,

2786
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,073
no.
Four thousand $950 ticket for two 

2787
01:58:29,451 --> 01:58:30,910
tickets.
Right.

2788
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:33,280
Sanction for row row.
Dod.

2789
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:34,460
Dude.
For Grant and what?

2790
01:58:34,461 --> 01:58:35,294
That guy fucking.
That's not even if I catch the 

2791
01:58:37,311 --> 01:58:41,950
handkerchief when he's done fucking 
preaching how much I get for a row to or

2792
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,080
not available.
Not available.

2793
01:58:44,081 --> 01:58:46,410
So now he's a resale tickets to know 
what it is,

2794
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:48,100
man.
They got fucking season passes.

2795
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:51,310
People probably buy season passes to 
Joel Olsteen says to tour.

2796
01:58:51,311 --> 01:58:52,510
This was for this.
Florida stopped.

2797
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:53,493
Well,
I saw there was a place that I was at 

2798
01:58:54,941 --> 01:58:58,690
that he was coming to one of them.
One of the big spots I was at.

2799
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:02,420
He does these arena tours and he does 
vegas too.

2800
01:59:02,421 --> 01:59:04,450
We does the fucking t mobile arena in 
Vegas.

2801
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:08,310
I want to see a picture of him up there.
His eyes open,

2802
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,050
smiling and shit.
It's crazy.

2803
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:14,620
It's a lot of money that guys make.
I used to say he's so full of Shit.

2804
01:59:14,621 --> 01:59:16,030
He can't look at the crowd.
That's eyes.

2805
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:21,060
Eyes are still here.
Are they still believe in this ship when

2806
01:59:23,231 --> 01:59:25,930
you lie in eye contact is the toughest 
fucking thing ever.

2807
01:59:25,931 --> 01:59:26,850
But whatever.

2808
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:27,763
He's.
He's making people feel good and he's 

2809
01:59:28,631 --> 01:59:30,160
making fuck.
He's in show business.

2810
01:59:30,161 --> 01:59:32,730
I want to see the show though.
He's in the God show Biz.

2811
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:33,623
You have.
You have to respect an arena act I 

2812
01:59:35,171 --> 01:59:36,640
think.
I think there's something to that.

2813
01:59:37,190 --> 01:59:41,860
There's something to do that.
It's a girl that was talking about.

2814
01:59:41,861 --> 01:59:46,861
She was lost and I think she was Jewish 
or maybe she converted to Judaism later,

2815
01:59:47,021 --> 01:59:47,854
but anyway,
for one point in time she was going to 

2816
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:50,670
the rock and roll church.
She was like,

2817
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:51,880
she was a sweet kid.
She was like,

2818
01:59:51,881 --> 01:59:53,680
you should go.
You would really like it.

2819
01:59:53,681 --> 01:59:55,180
I'm like a guarantee.
I wouldn't like it.

2820
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:56,100
I'm like,
wait.

2821
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:59,440
Some young hip guy probably sing songs.
Probably tries to fuck women,

2822
01:59:59,770 --> 02:00:00,980
like get Outta here with that.
Right?

2823
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:03,370
Like a yoga class.
It's like David Koresh.

2824
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:05,670
Waco got started.
How did it get started?

2825
02:00:05,670 --> 02:00:09,460
Get started with one guy with a guitar 
and he brought that message of Jesus and

2826
02:00:09,461 --> 02:00:12,300
he had some really profound things to 
say and people really,

2827
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:14,290
really helped them feel better.
Resonated with them.

2828
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:16,900
Then he started banging people's wives 
and that's what happens.

2829
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:18,990
It always happens.
Yeah.

2830
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:22,150
Well those rock and roll alternative 
churches,

2831
02:00:22,151 --> 02:00:23,980
there's a few of the.
Like the Justin Bieber Guy?

2832
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,230
No,
the guy that a justin bieber has,

2833
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:28,270
he's the one that told Justin to get off
the road,

2834
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:29,350
get off the road.
Justin,

2835
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:32,270
come back home to Jesus like he's 
getting.

2836
02:00:32,271 --> 02:00:34,960
He gets these guys to do a basketball 
player.

2837
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:37,380
Stopped playing basketball to play with.
No,

2838
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:37,780
no,
no,

2839
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:38,021
no,
no,

2840
02:00:38,021 --> 02:00:39,700
no.
That guy's not doing the road anymore.

2841
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:40,813
He goes back and forth.
It took a little time off or something 

2842
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,013
like the end of this tour.
Canceled his tour because of the 

2843
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:48,470
preacher told him it's when.

2844
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:50,530
Maybe he's right though.
Let's be honest.

2845
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:51,573
First of all,
bieber probably has a fucking billion 

2846
02:00:52,721 --> 02:00:53,554
dollars in the bank and maybe he was 
frayed around the edges is losing his 

2847
02:00:57,041 --> 02:00:59,110
fucking marbles.
The kid's 21 years old.

2848
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:02,800
He's about as famous as a human being.
Could possibly he only 21.

2849
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:05,200
He's young.
There's the preacher will go,

2850
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:05,770
Whoa,
Whoa,

2851
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:06,510
whoa,
Whoa,

2852
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:08,980
whoa.
What the fucking Dick Route.

2853
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,380
Hold up.
See what.

2854
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:13,420
See what's going on with his fucking 
shorts.

2855
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:15,250
Brow.
No,

2856
02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:16,091
no,
no,

2857
02:01:16,091 --> 02:01:16,601
no,
no,

2858
02:01:16,601 --> 02:01:19,690
no.
Any guy who show and Dick Route.

2859
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,120
You know what I mean?
Like the base of your cock.

2860
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:24,940
You're pulling your shorts down to base 
your cock like that.

2861
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:26,650
You're doing that because he's trying to
get laid.

2862
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:31,060
Stop.
Pull your shorts up to a normal height.

2863
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:33,970
Those things should be five inches 
higher.

2864
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,230
I know what you're doing.
Your,

2865
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:37,420
your cock is slapping against your 
thing.

2866
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:39,500
You probably don't even have underwear 
on you fucking creep.

2867
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:43,010
Jesus does not want you dressing like 
that.

2868
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:45,560
No.
Look at them.

2869
02:01:45,561 --> 02:01:46,940
It's got abs,
big old,

2870
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:47,793
handsome guy.
He probably Dixie chicks down for the 

2871
02:01:49,611 --> 02:01:50,570
Lord,
right?

2872
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:51,883
Dick's Dick's,
some down for Jesus and it's really 

2873
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:54,980
them.
Big Old,

2874
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:56,330
handsome,
charismatic guy,

2875
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:00,230
taking them down for Jesus.
Apparently he's a very.

2876
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:02,150
He's a host.
Good Daniel with Oprah.

2877
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,410
So you know he's legit.

2878
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:09,220
They're all in the same business selling
homes.

2879
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:12,290
I hope you enjoy.
Hey,

2880
02:02:12,350 --> 02:02:13,660
maybe he's good at it.
You know,

2881
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:15,800
maybe he's got something.
Maybe helps people.

2882
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:19,040
I'm suspicious.
I'm suspicious because of his shorts.

2883
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,113
Just that alone.
That should be on the wall all over his 

2884
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:23,510
church.
This is me at my worst.

2885
02:02:23,730 --> 02:02:24,440
Well,
the worst thing you did

2886
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:28,220
do what is an adult is to go out and try
and find parents again.

2887
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,880
That's the quickest way to end up in the
trunk of somebody's fucking car.

2888
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:34,130
It's fine.
Find someone to take care of you.

2889
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,280
Yeah.
Well you see,

2890
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,830
if you didn't see your parents didn't 
pay attention to or overly coddled you,

2891
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:41,603
I think.
Then you go out and you start looking 

2892
02:02:42,501 --> 02:02:44,870
for a mom and a dad,
a mom and a dad and a mom and a dad,

2893
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:46,490
and you just give away all this fucking 
power.

2894
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:47,703
I don't give power away to someone who 
shows Dick route when they pulled her 

2895
02:02:51,121 --> 02:02:53,460
shorts down to the base of their cock 
like that.

2896
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:57,180
Like as far as you can legally get your 
shorts down without showing your Dick.

2897
02:02:57,181 --> 02:02:59,610
As long as the pubes are trimmed.
I don't think it's okay.

2898
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:01,050
It's all right.
That's interesting.

2899
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:03,900
Right?
It will be a problem.

2900
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:06,810
Cause chaos down there and he pulled it 
out.

2901
02:03:06,811 --> 02:03:09,330
You could see the chaos,
like basically that's,

2902
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,193
that's.
There's a lot of pubes that you could 

2903
02:03:11,401 --> 02:03:13,530
see right there.
You could see a lot of pubes,

2904
02:03:13,650 --> 02:03:16,440
but if you did it would be a real issue.
Isn't that interesting?

2905
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:20,040
The same exact area is okay if you're 
only seeing skin,

2906
02:03:20,670 --> 02:03:22,230
but if you saw pubes right there,
you'd be like,

2907
02:03:22,231 --> 02:03:24,030
hey man,
what in the fuck?

2908
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:26,160
What are you doing that is so

2909
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:30,840
not acceptable in public that like that 
is a.

2910
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:31,703
that's almost like the male version of a
thong guy could wear a thong but might 

2911
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,400
be worse.
But it's funny though,

2912
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,710
Lisa,
if you have a thong on you just a freak,

2913
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:41,890
right?
I'm a freak.

2914
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:43,090
Oh No.
I,

2915
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,630
to be honest with naked guy,
always funny.

2916
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:47,260
It's pretty funny.
Naked.

2917
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,660
Sure.
It depends.

2918
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:50,450
Depends on the central guy.
Well,

2919
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,710
if you're alone and somebody jumped out 
of a Bush,

2920
02:03:52,711 --> 02:03:54,600
I mean that's fucking.
That's not a funny naked guy,

2921
02:03:54,601 --> 02:03:55,434
but he went back in the day when 
streaking when a guy would jump out and 

2922
02:03:59,251 --> 02:04:02,160
run across a football field.
It was the funniest.

2923
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:07,140
It was just the funniest fucking thing 
to tackle.

2924
02:04:07,141 --> 02:04:07,974
The guy now he's had it.
They always had a silly hat and they 

2925
02:04:10,081 --> 02:04:11,940
would just start fucking running across

2926
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:13,890
and I would always get me the fee.
I would.

2927
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:14,773
I would tense up when I'd see them 
tackle them because I would think about 

2928
02:04:16,371 --> 02:04:19,030
his dick is raw.
Dick's smashing into the

2929
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:20,030
dirt.
I saw guy,

2930
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:24,170
I saw a guy when I was at Boston 
University terriers game.

2931
02:04:24,171 --> 02:04:28,040
They don't even play soccer anymore.
Nickerson field and my fault.

2932
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:31,280
My Godfather took me to the game and we 
were sitting in this fucking.

2933
02:04:31,281 --> 02:04:32,114
Elliot was abandoned on and he was 
streaking across the field and we will 

2934
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:37,860
fucking crying.
Laughing.

2935
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:39,023
Insecurity was chasing was really fast.
He had a Bandana and like these fucking 

2936
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:45,720
like a date as dragons.
It was way back in the day,

2937
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:46,554
right.
Getting ran across and he tried to jump 

2938
02:04:49,831 --> 02:04:53,430
over this fucking concrete thing and he 
didn't land with this junk.

2939
02:04:53,431 --> 02:04:58,050
It was his inner thigh on the other one.
He got over and he and as far as I know,

2940
02:04:58,051 --> 02:04:59,690
he got away,
but I mean dude,

2941
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,890
it was just,
it wasn't even like,

2942
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:05,820
it wasn't a nice concrete.
Was that rough unfinished shit.

2943
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:08,940
And he tried to hurdle it and he got a.
He got his junk.

2944
02:05:08,941 --> 02:05:11,250
You got everything over and it was that 
other let other leg.

2945
02:05:12,290 --> 02:05:13,123
Nice fucking raspberry.
It's amazing how vulnerable your Dick 

2946
02:05:16,191 --> 02:05:17,960
is.
Dick and balls.

2947
02:05:18,370 --> 02:05:23,370
Just just simple,
simple trip with no pants on and slammed

2948
02:05:23,571 --> 02:05:25,290
down on your Dick and he horrible.

2949
02:05:25,690 --> 02:05:28,160
You would think there'd be some sort of 
junk rib cage

2950
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:35,900
to try and to try and protect it,
but it just started a turtle shell.

2951
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:37,020
No,
it is.

2952
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:39,590
It's just fucking just out there.
Just out there.

2953
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:40,533
Yeah.
It's a terrible design and that's why 

2954
02:05:43,341 --> 02:05:44,420
the function is.
I mean,

2955
02:05:44,421 --> 02:05:48,020
it has to go.
In no case you didn't notice because you

2956
02:05:48,021 --> 02:05:49,280
haven't been using your Dick,
you know what?

2957
02:05:49,281 --> 02:05:50,114
It's for it.
So it's something that someone has got 

2958
02:05:51,041 --> 02:05:52,040
it.
Something's got to be vulnerable,

2959
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:53,653
you know,
like the death star because your 

2960
02:05:55,390 --> 02:05:56,870
temperature,
that's what it's for.

2961
02:05:57,410 --> 02:05:59,060
Temperature.
Your body heats up too much,

2962
02:05:59,130 --> 02:05:59,963
kills your sperm.
So if your balls were internal and you 

2963
02:06:02,571 --> 02:06:03,404
were running around exercise and you'd 
cook all your sperm so their balls are 

2964
02:06:06,141 --> 02:06:09,710
hanging low on the outside.
Oh well why can't it go like in and out,

2965
02:06:09,711 --> 02:06:12,110
like one of those electric antennas?
Maybe in the future.

2966
02:06:12,111 --> 02:06:12,944
It will.
Yeah,

2967
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:13,913
maybe.

2968
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:16,540
Yeah.
People keep evolving.

2969
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:18,290
You find a way to suck it up into your 
body.

2970
02:06:18,291 --> 02:06:19,640
That was the thing that we always hear 
about.

2971
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:23,000
[inaudible],
which was a very particular hardstyle.

2972
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:25,690
Karate and guys would literally get 
kicked in the balls.

2973
02:06:25,691 --> 02:06:28,160
It would kick each other in the balls.
And the idea was that,

2974
02:06:28,161 --> 02:06:31,220
uh,
an under some dubious instructors.

2975
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:32,323
The idea was that these guys could 
actually suck their testicles up into 

2976
02:06:34,491 --> 02:06:35,324
their body.
Like they would train to pull their 

2977
02:06:36,411 --> 02:06:37,244
testicles up into their body.
And one day I talked to a doctor and 

2978
02:06:39,351 --> 02:06:40,430
he's like,
that's not possible.

2979
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:41,210
No,
it is like,

2980
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:42,830
no.
But they think they can,

2981
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:48,020
but there's some guys can develop the 
ability to take a shot to the nuts.

2982
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:51,200
Like there's been studies done on it.
There was a one of those,

2983
02:06:51,201 --> 02:06:53,780
a sports science shows.
Well these guys,

2984
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:54,673
they measured like the amount of force 
that a guy's throwing it at this guy's 

2985
02:06:58,371 --> 02:07:01,670
Dick when he punched him in the Dick and
the I stand in it like this.

2986
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:03,313
He lets people just fucking straight up,
punched them right in the balls and he 

2987
02:07:06,651 --> 02:07:11,651
can take effect his dad.
It's definitely not good.

2988
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:14,000
There's a trick to it.
There's certainly a trick.

2989
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:15,073
The trick would be that even though you 
are definitely making contact with the 

2990
02:07:17,841 --> 02:07:18,674
balls,
really most of the forces in the taint 

2991
02:07:20,511 --> 02:07:22,850
and the back of the ass because as you 
know,

2992
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:24,290
you're kicking somebody,
right?

2993
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:28,250
Your foot is extends past where your 
Shin is,

2994
02:07:28,251 --> 02:07:30,530
right?
Your Shin is here,

2995
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:31,483
your foot is here.
So if your foot is slamming into the 

2996
02:07:33,531 --> 02:07:37,060
guy's ass and taint,
it's really not.

2997
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:38,740
A lot of them.
I have,

2998
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:43,660
I've been kicked in the balls at least 
100 times hard by grown men who know how

2999
02:07:43,661 --> 02:07:44,494
to kick butt like black belts.
I've been kicked in the balls so many 

3000
02:07:47,531 --> 02:07:48,364
times because when you're sparring,
you get kicked in the balls all the 

3001
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:51,700
time.

3002
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:52,533
I mean,
all the time you'll probably just get 

3003
02:07:53,441 --> 02:07:55,600
used to the pace.
I thought before I had kids,

3004
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:58,060
I thought I'd probably put my fucking 
balls are probably totally useless.

3005
02:07:58,480 --> 02:07:59,830
I'm like,
I'm shooting blanks for sure.

3006
02:07:59,831 --> 02:08:04,210
I just thought of all the times I've 
been slammed into the balls I've.

3007
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:08,200
I mean I've had.
I've worn every fucking cup there is.

3008
02:08:08,201 --> 02:08:09,034
Especially back when I was competing.
They didn't like now they have some 

3009
02:08:10,631 --> 02:08:11,464
pretty sophisticated cups with like 
diamond mma is this cup that's got a 

3010
02:08:14,321 --> 02:08:15,154
compression short and it sucks down into
you and it's really hard rubber on the 

3011
02:08:18,251 --> 02:08:19,084
outside and you can actually take a good
shot to the balls and it's not going to 

3012
02:08:21,521 --> 02:08:23,440
kill you.
But back when I was doing it,

3013
02:08:23,441 --> 02:08:24,274
he would get those jocks who just be a 
cup that fits in a jock strap and you 

3014
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:31,330
pull them up and then eventually they 
made some for martial arts where it just

3015
02:08:31,331 --> 02:08:34,870
curved under a little bit more and the 
cup went back to your taint.

3016
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,620
And the,
the downside of that was it,

3017
02:08:37,621 --> 02:08:38,880
it was,
there was a lot of uh,

3018
02:08:38,930 --> 02:08:40,900
abrasiveness.
When you're throwing kicks,

3019
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:43,390
it will like rub against your inner 
thigh.

3020
02:08:43,391 --> 02:08:45,430
And there was no compression shorts back
then either.

3021
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:50,740
But I have absolutely been fucking bet 
everything I have,

3022
02:08:50,741 --> 02:08:55,450
I've been kicked in the balls 100 times.
A No question about it.

3023
02:08:56,510 --> 02:08:59,780
They should take like a fucking,
you know,

3024
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:00,614
like they do like a mold.
They should do a mold of your junk 

3025
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:03,763
custom.
They should remember that group of use 

3026
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:09,230
of like a mold of like all the rock 
stars,

3027
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:14,780
Dicks,
like a fleshlight for porn stars.

3028
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:18,470
You can do that.
So they would secure.

3029
02:09:18,700 --> 02:09:19,900
Yeah.
I don't know.

3030
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:23,560
A gross look on your face and I just.
Yeah,

3031
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:24,200
I,
I get,

3032
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:27,410
I get weirded out by.
I get weirded out by that shit.

3033
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:29,970
Flashlights.
Yeah.

3034
02:09:30,110 --> 02:09:33,240
Like once this,
the non human element in gay,

3035
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:35,540
you want to fuck this thing that isn't 
alive.

3036
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:37,340
There's just something like,
you know.

3037
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:38,870
Yeah.
That's just fucking.

3038
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:42,200
This is my asshole is a rubber version 
of my asshole.

3039
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:42,720
I.
Yeah.

3040
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,630
I always,
I always,

3041
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:45,473
yeah.
Going back in the day when you had 

3042
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:48,680
wanted to get porn,
you had to go into a store.

3043
02:09:48,681 --> 02:09:50,300
I just,
this stuff always,

3044
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:54,830
it just seemed serial killer,
like body part type dehumanizing.

3045
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:59,220
It's very effective though with the 
flashlight was a sponsor for awhile when

3046
02:09:59,330 --> 02:10:00,680
I remember the days.
Yeah.

3047
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:01,843
Those things were great.
I stopped using them now even though 

3048
02:10:05,690 --> 02:10:10,690
like I try it,
I had to try it after awhile.

3049
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:12,490
The listeners.
Oh yeah.

3050
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:15,650
That's it only for the list.
It's very effective.

3051
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:18,190
Okay.
You know about this?

3052
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:20,420
What's that?
It's called ankle.

3053
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:24,200
What?
Oh,

3054
02:10:24,201 --> 02:10:25,520
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

3055
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:32,320
how do you not like become like,
how does that not do brain to fuck that?

3056
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:38,600
Oh Jesus.
That's so disgusting.

3057
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:39,463
Can you.
You think it's bad getting caught 

3058
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:43,490
jerking off.
Can you imagine if you swam in this foot

3059
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:45,200
and 10 fucking.
First of all,

3060
02:10:45,201 --> 02:10:49,040
it looks real enough that you fucking 
killed somebody and now you fucking.

3061
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:51,050
Oh my God,
you could fuck a whole leg.

3062
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:53,900
That it's crazy how realistic that 
looks.

3063
02:10:54,230 --> 02:10:56,110
It looks like she's hanging from the 
ceiling through.

3064
02:10:56,130 --> 02:10:56,963
This has like the skin of her heel.
It looks like it's kind of mushy a 

3065
02:11:00,531 --> 02:11:01,311
little bit.
Right?

3066
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:02,144
Like it's moving around because I want 
this site might get a little weirder to 

3067
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:06,770
this as you can build your own mannequin
here.

3068
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:11,050
So let's just get the fuck outta here.
Yeah,

3069
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:12,700
we are a.
we're like,

3070
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,300
what are you doing?
I'm in synthetics.

3071
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:16,920
That's what that's called.
Synthetics.

3072
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:21,060
Like parachutes and stuff.
Something like that.

3073
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:22,560
Something,
something like that.

3074
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:27,360
What is it?
A a one hour fucking elbow get.

3075
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:29,010
No,
here's my business card.

3076
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:35,403
I Dunno.
That's when I think you buy that in a 

3077
02:11:38,050 --> 02:11:39,670
few weeks later,
you buy a giant freezer.

3078
02:11:43,180 --> 02:11:46,010
Just think you're going down that road.
Yeah.

3079
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:47,870
It ain't good.
That's not good.

3080
02:11:47,871 --> 02:11:48,704
Which I honestly think like there's so 
many people that had tendencies that 

3081
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:54,740
never when you're just living in log 
cabins and shit,

3082
02:11:54,741 --> 02:11:58,060
like he just never were able to explore.
And I,

3083
02:11:58,210 --> 02:12:00,890
I feel like the same way,
you know,

3084
02:12:00,891 --> 02:12:01,724
I can watch all these people building 
cars and stuff or you can tap into some 

3085
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:09,410
dark shit about yourself and uh,
you know,

3086
02:12:09,710 --> 02:12:10,543
the thing opens the coffin lid and sits 
up and then that's in your fucking 

3087
02:12:13,731 --> 02:12:14,760
personality.
Now it's,

3088
02:12:14,770 --> 02:12:15,920
it's a very,
it's a very,

3089
02:12:15,921 --> 02:12:17,240
uh,
I don't know.

3090
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:19,340
I,
I try to stay away from shit like that.

3091
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:20,203
Well,
especially if your kid has been abused 

3092
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:23,570
that I think that's the real trigger.
Real triggers.

3093
02:12:23,571 --> 02:12:24,404
Kids that get abused,
they get abused young and then they
