1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,730
Well,
hey fuckers,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,970
ha ha

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,880
the shows on right now.

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:15,230
We're live tweeting at the
same time he bitches sweet,

5
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:18,170
sweet pitches. When I say bitches,
I mean that would no disrespect.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,960
Some of my best friends are bitches.
Matter of fact,

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,940
all of them at one point in time
I've called a bitch. If I don't,

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,280
if I don't like call you
a bitch at one point,

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,240
bitch please or come on bitch.
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,270
If I don't say that at least once in our
relationship, I don't feel close to you.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,410
Do not see him talking, then we are
really tight. We're tight as fuck dude.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,783
Bitch.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,620
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by legal zoom.

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,190
If you have a situation like
you want to become incorporated,

15
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:53,570
do you want to become an LLC?
You want to make a will. Uh,

16
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:56,510
you want to handle some
standard legal stuff.

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,720
Most of the time you got to go to a
lawyer, you got to make an appointment,

18
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:04,190
go somewhere, sit down, talk
to some dude or a woman,

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,720
give them a ton of money.

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,630
And it's very frustrating that you
can't handle that stuff on your own.

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,930
Legal Zoom though allows you to handle
most of those types of transactions.

22
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:19,070
Like will's like, uh,
becoming yellow, an LLC.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,160
All those things you can do online. Naked.
Okay? You don't even have to be sober.

24
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,900
You could be playing with yourself.

25
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,080
You could have your cock in one hand
and a mouse and the other and no one can

26
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:34,550
stop you. Man. They can't tell you
what to do. They don't own you. Okay?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,170
But if you go to,
there's silly little legal box,

28
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,970
the legal box, we have to say, hi,

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,060
the lady that sits at the desk and
once to fucking jump off a bridge,

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,880
you have to say,
how did that check bored out of her skull?

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,130
And then you have to give
up credit card information,

32
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:50,900
your address and your this and your that.

33
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,840
And then you wait for the guy to
let you in and then, oh Jesus.

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,370
And then somebody cops on you as SARS.
Oh, Brett Dunkin. That's not what happens.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,210
Anyway, legal zoom.com go there
and check it out. Use the code.

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,320
J R e and save yourself some
money. Is it January? No.

37
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:09,190
Legal Zoom is rogue again.
Which ones? Jerry? Uh,

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,640
they really should all be universal
stamp dot coms Jerry. Yeah,

39
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,560
use a code name Brogan and save yourself
some money. It's an excellent service.

40
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:19,280
Brian is actually used it, although
I, you know, I wouldn't really

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,920
and really bring that up,

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,200
but they can do things for you and
they can also get you in touch with a

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,350
legitimate independent attorney if you
get like along the process and you know,

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,600
I've done this before with
certain things where you're a,

45
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:39,590
you're going over some fine print of
something and you're like, oh, okay,

46
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:41,630
I got to stop here.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing this.

47
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,650
This shit just got deep. I just
wanted to deep water. Well if you,

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,740
if you feel that way,

49
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,630
legal zoom can connect you
with an independent attorney
and a legal team is not

50
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:51,500
a law firm.

51
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,000
They just offer you legal services
online that you could do yourself.

52
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,640
They will guide you through it.
But if you get confused,

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,070
they hook you up with an attorney.

54
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,200
Use a code name rogue and
save yourself some money.

55
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,180
We'll also brought to you by stamps.com
if you've ever been in those desk squad

56
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:11,290
kitty cat shirts at Brian red band cells
and there's a new one on the way out.

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,310
Uh, it's available right now for
presale. If you go a death squad.tv,

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,330
it's my favorite yet.

59
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,680
It's pretty dope malicious and it's a
much higher quality than the other ones

60
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,511
with uh,
the,

61
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:26,350
the ink is like printed into the shirt
itself instead of being like a plastic

62
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:30,730
decal. They're very cool. Brian
Cells, all of those himself does,

63
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:34,810
it makes them himself hasn't printed and
then actually sends them out himself.

64
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,550
So if you get a box from Brian, read
Ben, it's been touched by his DNA.

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,290
It might, it's, it's healthy. I mean
it's not, it's on dangerous DNA,

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,971
but you know you,

67
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:48,130
you could convict him or something if
you wanted to like take this box and he

68
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,870
licked things on there and you could say,

69
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:53,260
this motherfucker licked my ass and
just stick it on your ass and then go

70
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,590
directly to a doctor and then they swab
your ass with the cute. My point is

71
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,680
stamps.com is a simple way of sending
things through the mail with just using

72
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:04,210
your own personal computer and a printer.

73
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,060
Instead of going to the post office
with a box of shit that you're trying to

74
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:10,450
sell and have it all laid out,
you could do it all at home.

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,460
You also have a wonderful
opportunity to save some money.

76
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,230
If you click on the old school,

77
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:22,090
you microphone in the upper right
hand corner and use the code j. R.

78
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,090
E you get $115 value,

79
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,450
which is includes a free digital scale
and a $55 of a of postage postage credit.

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,090
It's an excellent service and it
makes things fun. It's a fun, hi.

81
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,380
It's fun to get stamps. Yeah,
yeah. Print it all up on your, uh,

82
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,300
your printer. That was Duncan
Trussell. He's, he's strange,
but I love him. Anyway,

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,310
you use the code j r e@stamps.com and
save yourself some money and excellent

84
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,570
service one that we fully endorse here
on the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

85
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,870
This episode is also brought to you by
on it. And this is the last sponsor,

86
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:03,730
I swear to the baby Jesus. Um,
on it. Makers of Alpha brain,

87
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:07,480
the cognitive nootropic subst.
Well,

88
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,150
I don't know if most people don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

89
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,160
When you say new tropics,
when nootropics are,

90
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,150
is essentially vitamins that enhance
the way your brain functions.

91
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:20,880
It gives you all the fuel that you
need to create neurotransmitters,

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,660
the building blocks, if you will, a
very controversial stuff. Read up on it.

93
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:29,320
But one thing that I can tell you with
utmost confidence now is we've already

94
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:33,790
done the first in a series of double
blind placebo tests and had excellent

95
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,020
results with Alpha brain.

96
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:38,800
So that was a big relief because you
take something and even though you read a

97
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,510
bunch of shit that says
it does a really good,

98
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,690
and even though you're read all these
positive results and even though you read

99
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,130
even peer reviewed evidence about the
actual ingredients that are in Alpha brain

100
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,070
until you get your own
double blind placebo study,

101
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,100
people don't give a fuck about you.
Unfortunately it was only,

102
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,920
we did it with 20 people
and four dropped out.

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,830
It's enough to to have like a full blown
study. So we're going to do another one.

104
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:05,210
But the point is the results were
positive and it was done the correct way.

105
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:09,500
Double Blind Placebo Style and a,
it showed improvements in memory,

106
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,650
improvements in cognitive function.
We'll explain it all once the uh,

107
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:13,700
the piece is published,

108
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,520
but it's a huge weight off my back
and a lot of the people's back because

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,780
rightly so,

110
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,650
whenever someone comes out with something
that says that it's a brain enhancing

111
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:22,460
supplement,

112
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,910
people start thinking about all those big
Dick pills that you see and those porn

113
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:28,680
ads don't really work. You
start thinking about, oh,

114
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,800
a lot of other snake oil type situations.

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,370
I personally have been using
nootropics though for a long time.

116
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,460
I started out with a Roman
house skis neuro one. It's a, a,

117
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,920
a common atory a thing like this that
you mix it, you make a drink out of it.

118
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:46,640
And I, uh, I read about it and Bill Roman
[inaudible] who was a football player,

119
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,140
he started making that stuff,
uh,

120
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,250
and using nootropics after dealing with
head injuries from concussions from

121
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:53,084
football.

122
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,890
It's a fascinating topic that most
people are kind of ignorant about.

123
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,720
But if you're,
if you're interested in it,

124
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:03,320
I suggest you pursue it because there
is definitely some fruit at the end of

125
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,910
that tree. Um, we're also, um,

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,570
can I pipe in for a second?
Yeah.

127
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,140
I'm not sponsored by
on it for some reason.

128
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:15,250
I don't know what I did do
it Venda on it company. So,

129
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,690
but I can honestly say because I have
no financial stake at all. In fact,

130
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:24,130
I've been rejected by
the company that I love.

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,790
I take Alpha brain and what Joe won't say,
is it speed?

132
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,260
It's just, it's good speed.
It's like low level Adderall.

133
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,060
I don't get that at all. I don't get
that at all. It's not, that's not what

134
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,120
the function of the nutrients inside of
it or, or you know, like designed to do.

135
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,210
Yeah, it gives me a very good,
when I say speed, I don't mean bad.

136
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,420
I mean that's good.
It's like a nice buzz.

137
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,730
You take it and you feel awake.

138
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,810
I like taking it a all day when I have it.

139
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:58,070
I go through the jars within three
days. They're just gone. Well,

140
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:01,390
it gives you weird
dreams. Oh fuck man. My,

141
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,550
I took a nap today that was like Jacob's
ladder taking Alpha brain and I swear I

142
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,104
was in it,

143
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,670
an airplane sucking on
the feet of this woman.

144
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,270
She was flying the plane. Yeah. And I was
like laying on dirt, sucking her feet.

145
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,060
I had an offer for

146
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,770
brain dream the other day. Uh, I tweeted
about it. It was about Bobby Collins.

147
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:30,210
The comedian was doing a talk show out
of his apartment and in the opening

148
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:35,211
montage of his talk show is Sam Kinison
his comb over and it's flying around the

149
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:39,110
air, getting pelted by meteors
while it's flying around,

150
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,800
just like explosions.

151
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,580
His comb overs flying around in the sky
and the meteors are hitting his comb

152
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:49,470
over. It was the most nonsensical,
ridiculous. You can't make this up dream.

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,310
And I woke up in the middle of it because
my alarm went off and it was one of

154
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,730
those where it's like, you're right
in the middle rem sleep and you'll,

155
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,890
your alarm wakes up and you're like, what
the fuck? Yeah, that is good. I don't,

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,320
I think that was one of the best
pieces of at least anecdotal evidence.

157
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,910
Alpha brain actually was working
that was doing something was the,

158
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,960
the uniformity of the reports of people
saying that it affected their dreams in

159
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:16,140
a very radical way. Why are you
making everything Paul Pink? Uh,

160
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,430
go to [inaudible] dot com it's a lot of
the shit we sell, including Kettlebells,

161
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,970

or kettle bells with a awesome
designs carved into them.

163
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,990
We hired a special effects designer
to make an angry, angry chimp.

164
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,640
We've got a gorilla coming out soon.

165
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,700
We've got a a bunch of a really
cool designs in the future.

166
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,000
We sell a bunch of healthy shoots
that's tossed around. We sell powders.

167
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,340
It enhances your body's ability to
produce testosterone. All of these things.

168
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,230
Also,
all these controversial things.

169
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,960
They're all explained with science and
references on on [inaudible] dot com use

170
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:48,810
the code name Brogan.

171
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,820
Save 10% off Duncan trussell's here
and were fin to get our free gone.

172
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,430
Hello.
Hey pitches.

173
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,920
Oh,
good experience.

174
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,720
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
Ooh,

175
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,510
Nice. So that worked all
day. Did the show all day.

176
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,340
And this never feels like work. This
always feels like, ah, the podcast,

177
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,210
the podcast. It's nothing. It's not work.
I mean, it isn't. It isn't. It's never,

178
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,960
I mean,
if you start thinking this is work,

179
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:24,460
there's going to be a lot of coal miners.
You think your toxic

180
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,790
Duncan Trussell on TV today. Oh,
crazy. Yeah. Kind of freaking out it.

181
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,250
I thought you would handle it well,
but you're not. You kind of tricking,

182
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,563
tweaking a little bit.

183
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm excited. How do I not be
excited about this? I'm just fine

184
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,840
with, you know, you're
handling it very well. I mean,

185
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:50,320
it's exciting and it's like a thank
you for getting me on the show.

186
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:53,770
Thanks for doing it. You may
of that. That's a cool thing.

187
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:58,570
Manda usher uh, your friends into
something like that. Cause it's,

188
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:02,620
it's, so, it's been such a freakish
year for me, man. You know,

189
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,020
it's like in the beginning was fucked up.

190
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:09,970
Balls snipped off for folks who don't
know, you got cancer of your balls,

191
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,110
ball got snipped. They took one of
your testicles home. They threw it. Oh,

192
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:17,380
I always wonder where it is.
It's going to cat's litter box somewhere.

193
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,480
But it's great because the year culminated
in being out in the Pacific northwest

194
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:26,944
with you.

195
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,190
Hi.
As a fucking

196
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,630
watching hunting for Sasquatch,

197
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,300
it really was like, well this is great
man. This is like a one. This is,

198
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,200
this is definitely one of the coolest
years of my life. That was so fun.

199
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,690
It was so fun. It really is. It's like

200
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,040
we've sort of, we've made this
life inside of a simulation.

201
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,210
Like it doesn't make any sense.

202
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,610
Like when you actually have
a job where you get to go.

203
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,130
Like we went Utah last week looking

204
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,900
for Ufos and giant bulletproof wolves.
These people,

205
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,070
they see wolves that turn into messed
and disappear and the fucking show up on

206
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:07,330
top of barns. The size of a horse. Yeah.
Bulletproof wolves. The size of a horse.

207
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,180
We're, we're having so much
fun. It's so ridiculous.

208
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,410
Like we're talking to so many crazy
people and so many really interesting like

209
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,600
sciencey people too.

210
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,330
Yeah. It's so fun to be
around, that's for sure man.

211
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:20,460
It's definitely spun me
around in a lot of ways.

212
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:24,310
It's helped me understand how
religions starts. It's helped me.

213
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,060
I go stand delusion.
Yeah.

214
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,230
It's helped me understand that part of
myself that is delusional or the part of

215
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:35,910
myself that uh, is either too
eager to disbelieve something,

216
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:39,670
are too eager to believe something. Like
that's where my pendulum swings. Right?

217
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,520
Like, and in that middle place, people
don't like that middle place places. Yeah.

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,480
People don't like it there, you know?
Cause that middle place is the mystery.

219
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:53,160
People don't like that feeling. That's
why I live. Yeah. That's my spot. Yeah.

220
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:56,710
I think it's cool to get there, but God
dammit, it's like that's no fun. I mean

221
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,620
be there with my life too though. I like
to be there with my life. I like to be,

222
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,100
that's one of the reasons why I do so
many different things. At the same time,

223
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,080
I don't like to be comfortable that much.

224
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,320
I mean I like too comfortable
in friendships and I
like to be comfortable in

225
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,140
relationships. But as far as like
work stuff and life stuff and and,

226
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:16,260
and my pursuits,
whether it's a competition or exercising,

227
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,970
I don't like to be comfortable.
I think that's, that's the enemy.

228
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,410
I like to be plenty comfortable when
I'm at home and I'm lounging, yeah,

229
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,020
I'm chilling with my family or
I'm hanging with my friends.

230
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:29,890
I love being comfortable then.
But other than that I don't like it.

231
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,240
So like when it, when it comes with an
idea, like an idea of what is or isn't,

232
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,410
what is or isn't possible, that middle
spot of the pendulum where it's all weird.

233
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,020
That's my favorite spot because I like
when you're in a situation and people go

234
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,710
big foot, you believe in big foot and
then you bring a guy like Jeff Meldrum,

235
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,450
that guy that we talked to,
the anthropologist who is,
you know, you've got a phd,

236
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,340
an expert in human movement.

237
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,150
And he starts explaining things like the
metatarsal break that you find in these

238
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:01,210
footprints that indicates it's
built like a gorilla's foot,

239
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,790
not like a human foot because
human beings don't have,

240
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,020
and then you see this break
and he demonstrates it and
then you start going, huh,

241
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,900
you're talking to a fucking smart dude.
The believes his shit. Like this is weird.

242
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,850
Yeah. And then we asked him if we'd be
willing to cut off a pinky. Oh yeah. Toe.

243
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,350
I, yeah. Got Weird. You have
to watch the show Dunkin.

244
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,460
I can't have to wash the shaking
and watch myself on TV. Oh, you can.

245
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,580
You were great. Uh, the, uh, the,

246
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,470
that place is a very zen
place, man. That's like,

247
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,700
why this a Zen Roshi I met when
I went on this Rom doss retreat.

248
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:39,760
That's what she kept saying again,
again, is live in the mystery.

249
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,210
That's where we belong, is in the
mystery. It's, you don't, you can't,

250
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,570
you're not going to know
what happens after you die.

251
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,830
You're not going to figure that out.

252
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,490
And the place of like the Zen place or
the Buddhist or the nonattached place to

253
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,180
be as a place where you are,
it's not that you don't know or do know,

254
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,980
it's some other state of just,

255
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,630
I guess being at the crest of the wave
of the universe articulating itself and

256
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,620
as you,

257
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,180
yeah, and what's important when I say
that I like to be in the ministry, what I,

258
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,240
what I really mean like that about that
is if it's a mystery and there's some

259
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:17,750
shifts, it's not a mystery at all.
And that's also a part of the thing.

260
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,550
It's recognizing what is an actual
ministry. And when you do find it,

261
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,690
like the nature of reality,
if you get to one of those weird ones,

262
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,840
the possibility of a universal power
that's controlling the world and moving it

263
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,640
into a certain direction.

264
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,680
The idea that this is all some sort of
a mathematical program and that good and

265
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:43,460
evil and sex and love and all
this different shit, good and bad,

266
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,440
all sort of make sure that this thing
keeps moving. That's the real mystery.

267
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,430
It's not chem trails. Okay. You know
what I'm saying? Like it's, it's not,

268
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,880
it's not ghosts. The real me.
There's plenty of mystery.

269
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,200
The real mystery is does every decision
that you make literally branch off and

270
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:03,140
start a whole new reality and a
whole universe that you live in?

271
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,750
Because sometimes it feels
like that and I'm not sure,

272
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,100
and I don't think you're sure either.

273
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,120
When someone tells me they're sure or are
shorts not, are they sure there? Sure.

274
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:15,590
It is either one of those. It's
unacceptable because you can't be sure.

275
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,000
There's things that you can't be shoring.

276
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,450
Those things are really weird and it's
hard to get comfortable in those things.

277
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,480
It's hard to get comfortable,
like holding on,

278
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,720
holding on to those ideas and like and
pondering them because a lot of them,

279
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,250
the implications they, they, they
transfer through your entire life.

280
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,180
The implications are, well if you really
are building up a career and bill,

281
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:35,871
but you're,
you're,

282
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,890
you're just a part of the ether and you're
part of like some sort of a gigantic

283
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:42,500
super organism. Like why are you
concentrating so much on yourself?

284
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,040
Like why are you twisting your
mustache at the end with wax? Why you,

285
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,260
why you doing this? Why
you buying, you know,

286
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:51,830
$2,000 shoes that you hope somebody
notices? Why are you, you know,

287
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:54,770
what are you doing? W what,
what is going on? Yeah.

288
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,230
Are those things distracting
you from the mystery,

289
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,330
you know? Well, I mean

290
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,110
it seems like there's two parts
to a person, which is the, the,

291
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,130
the part that is the personality that
conditioning everything you've learned,

292
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:14,400
all the, all the tricks that
you've learned from other
people. A lot of imitation,

293
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,860
you know,
a lot of observing things in the,

294
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,380
imitating them and forgetting
that you imitated them.

295
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,550
There's probably personality and
components in us that we picked up in the

296
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:27,840
fourth grade from some kid we thought
was cool and just forgot about it and it

297
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:32,280
stuck inside of us. And so then there's
this idea that we're kind of like, uh,

298
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,580
the human body itself is a hive and it
is a hive that within which dwell all

299
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:42,570
these different bees and the bees
are all the different aspects of our

300
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:44,940
personality.
We're not one person.

301
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,150
We're a harmony of personalities that
are always sort of through cause like if

302
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:54,060
you think of the you and you're really
pissed off whenever you're yelling at

303
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:58,560
someone or in a state where you find
yourself in a confrontational place and

304
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,350
then you think of the you and you're
chilling at home with your family,

305
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,080
that's like two different people,
you know.

306
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,700
And so that's the idea is that there's
all these different parts of us that are

307
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,530
rolling through all the time,

308
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:15,531
always rolling through and that we
are constantly working to uphold the

309
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:20,350
continuity of being by acting
in certain ways all the time.

310
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,150
And quite often you'll hear us like if
you're in a relationship or something,

311
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:27,210
someone will say like,
I don't know you anymore.

312
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,320
It was this person you know and it's
because really what they're seeing is the

313
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:32,640
other one something,

314
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:35,880
one of the other dominant personalities
that lives inside of you that starting

315
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,470
to poke its head out every once in
awhile and people that don't have a good

316
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:42,000
transition between those.

317
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,980
Those are the people we call multiple
personality disorder people. Yes, exactly.

318
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,760
And how many, how many Abby's are
in there with you Abby? Yeah man.

319
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,730
That's what it is and when those,
when those in and you see are,

320
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:58,731
when people say that they're channeling
or when people are demon possessed,

321
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,940
really what's happening is one of these
personalities that is gotten shoved way

322
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:07,200
deep down in the dark part of the hive
is managed to claw it's way out and it's

323
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:10,020
so different than all the other
ones that people are like,

324
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:15,000
this guy has got a demon in
him when really the truth
is we're just this cluster

325
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,360
of of selves that are all sort
of like the way it's been. This,

326
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,040
I heard there's this mystic
named Gurdjieff who described
it as like a mansion

327
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,350
where all the servants are running amok.

328
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,800
So it's a mansion where all the servants
who were supposed to have certain jobs

329
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,040
and certain areas where they work in the
mansion of just lost and forgotten what

330
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:35,970
they're supposed to be doing.
They're all going crazy.

331
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:40,950
And so then modern person is wandering
around with this kind of constant,

332
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,450
chaotic stream of personalities
that aren't disciplined in any way.

333
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,410
And so the beginning of spiritual
life for the beginning of discipline,

334
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,490
martial arts, whatever the thing is, is
where the master of the house returns.

335
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,280
And that's considered the
personality that develops.

336
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:59,460
Once you control all those
different facets of the self,

337
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,120
and that's what you become is the
master of the House who's gone away.

338
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,940
And while he was away,
all of the servants went nuts.

339
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,450
That's what happens when you get drunk
like gay, the mass design here. Woo.

340
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,870
Yeah. There were over your
face [inaudible] tags.

341
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,140
Yeah. Where's my keys? Yeah.

342
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,570
And it's also why you have to
be compassionate to people.

343
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,640
If someone around you
has been a dick to you.

344
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,330
So you know some really stupid people
when someone's addicted them will never

345
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:32,030
forgive them for the rest of your life.
You'd be like,

346
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,520
you remember the time you said that to
me? Oh, you know, and it's like, well,

347
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:38,310
that was just a part of me that came out.
That's not me.

348
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,810
That's not the totality of me.

349
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:43,690
That's just somebody made who managed
to get to the window and scream,

350
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:47,100
scream something. That's a real problem.
Those people that want to bring up,

351
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,280
that happened a long

352
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,370
time ago over and over and over again.
Oh.

353
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,850
And just always use it as a button to
get sympathy. Like, that's not good.

354
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,730
That's not healthy for you.
It's not healthy for them.

355
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:01,790
It's not healthy for anybody. Like people
that can't let certain things. I mean,

356
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,580
there's certain things you
shouldn't let go. You know?

357
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:06,520
Like if you were in a concentration
camp and Hitler killed your family,

358
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,510
you'd be like, Hey Dick,
you know my family.

359
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,630
But if you're like,
you know,

360
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,020
if you yelled at someone because he didn't
want to get up and take out the trash,

361
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,460
like let's you know,
let that go.

362
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,060
Yeah, you got to let it go. Mostly you
gotta just let it go if you can. It's,

363
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,490
it's hard though man.
I mean I,

364
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,160
I ruminate over shit that people
have done to me sometimes.

365
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,460
Like I'll find myself from ruminating it,
which is such a waste,

366
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,820
such a waste of time.
Dude, I had Graham Hancock,

367
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:37,330
I skyped with Graham Hancock on my
podcast today. Oh that's beautiful.

368
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,560
Blew my mind man. He like,
that guy is so God damn smart.

369
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,630
He's got a book out now, a fiction
book called War War War Guy. Yeah.

370
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,120
And he's really excited about it

371
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,500
when he starts talking about history.

372
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,040
It's amazing cause you feel like you're
with somebody who is actually lived

373
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,740
during that time when he was
describing like a Mayan sacrifices.

374
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:05,310
When he starts talking about that, it's
not like reading it in a history book.

375
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:10,070
Like when he talks about the jagged
Flint tools to slice open the chest.

376
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,620
I'm not even doing it. I get why? Don't
know what acronyms, terrible accident.

377
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,050
But he, yeah, the thing he
was talking about today, and
it was, I, it was, you know,

378
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,710
inspired from talking about his
book is this idea a gnostic idea,

379
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,900
which is,
uh,

380
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,150
gnosticism is this weird philosophy
that believes that the god that everyone

381
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:34,110
worships currently, uh, and, and all the
different religions, the Christian God,

382
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,810
the, uh, Muslim God,

383
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,900
any God that's being worshiped is actually
an evil force known as the demiurge.

384
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,890
It's something that
is, uh, actually Satan.

385
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:51,090
So the thing that the Christians are the
thing that whispers in the Christians

386
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:55,860
ear, that it's time to go to war or the
thing that convinces some uninstall omic

387
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,150
terrorist,
a strap,

388
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,320
plastic explosives to his chest
and go running into a cafe.

389
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,480
It's like an evil force
that's been controlling the
planet and manipulating the

390
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:10,860
people on the planet by pretending to
be a god and causing them to do insane

391
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:14,030
things. Where's this concept come
from? Not, it's called gnosticism.

392
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,440
Well, I know at Gnosticism is,
but this concept of that is from,

393
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,500
yeah, and that's the demiurge
and the demiurge created humans.

394
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,110
So humans are all the
children of the demiurge.

395
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,790
Humans are the children of this force,

396
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:32,430
which is kind of the spirit of matter
that is all about dominance and fear,

397
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,010
right?

398
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,670
Troll what a crazy idea.

399
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,930
And that's why people like
overwhelmingly throughout human history,

400
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:43,440
there's never been a period of time
where no one's done anything evil ever.

401
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,100
There's never been a period of
time as far we can tell as far

402
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,933
as written history,

403
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,030
there's never been a period of time
where nobody controlled anybody.

404
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:52,940
Nobody hit anybody, nobody murdered
anybody. And then we stole anything.

405
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,130
Nobody raped anybody,
nobody beat their kids.

406
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,670
There's never been one time where like
nothing happened bad for like a year.

407
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,070
Everybody was just hugs
and love and kisses.

408
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,700
But yet we hold on to this idea that well,

409
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:08,400
people were mostly good.
We're basically good. Yeah,

410
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,750
peaceful in their hearts.
All people are basically good.

411
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,600
But if you look at the totality of the,

412
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,630
the behavior of human beings and you
factor in the time of utmost piece to time

413
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:22,190
of ultimate peace,
it's a zero.

414
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,470
There's 0% ultimate peace in
the totality of the human race.

415
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:31,400
It's never happened. Yup,
that's right. You occasionally
get that in the household.

416
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,090
You occasionally get that in a community
where there's just a mild disagreements.

417
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,210
They tried to keep it to a little bit
of Shit, talking behind people's back,

418
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,270
you know? But then as you spread
out and he'd get into cities,

419
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,440
there's no cities where nobody gets
robbed. No, they don't exist in religion.

420
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,380
Communities want to talk about
some fucking stink holes. Dude,

421
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,270
I'm reading this book by Jon Krakauer
called under the banner of Heaven,

422
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,310
which is about fundamentalist Mormons.
Do you know about this? No. Whew.

423
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,970
Holy Shit. Does that like the
Jeffries Guy? Yeah, there's it.

424
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,910
I think so. The Jeffries,
which was the Jeffries Guy,

425
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,770
was the guy that goes, just got
arrested. He was the polygamists.

426
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,710
Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. It's, so
here's the way it works. There is,

427
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:15,690
in this book it talks about,
I can't remember the town,

428
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,960
but there is an area that
is run completely by a guy
named Uncle Ruan or was run

429
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:26,970
by this guy named uncle rule on who
is a Mormon fundamentalist. This,

430
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:29,860
these are, these people
are rejected by the, uh,

431
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,050
mainstream Mormons because the
government came in at one point and said,

432
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:38,190
you guys can't be polygamous.
It's illegal. And so they
had to renounce polygamy.

433
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,800
And this was something that
according to this book,

434
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:44,040
Joseph Smith said was
the essence of Mormonism.

435
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,600
It's still one of the most deepest,

436
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:49,050
most important parts of Mormonism
is that you have multiple,

437
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:53,870
or what they call a plurality of wives,
morality. That's good learning. So,

438
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,070
and here's the thing.
This is why you need a bunch of wives.

439
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,620
If you are a fundamentalist Mormon,

440
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,790
you are only supposed to have sex
with your wife when she's ovulating.

441
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,600
Which means if you only have one wife,

442
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,600
you're not only going to have sex
a few times a month, once a month.

443
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,350
I don't know how women ovulate
once a month. If you have 15 wives,

444
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,270
you can fuck every night.

445
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,780
So it's very important to have as many
wives as possible because then you could

446
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:21,240
have sex with them all the time.
And they're always humping.

447
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,740
And a lot of these guys have so
many children. They, one of the,

448
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:27,870
I can't remember which one it was.
It might've been uncle Ruan.

449
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,080
I can't remember which one had so many
children that they named them according

450
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,950
to the year. So if you were born in like
1979 you are, your name would have an ae.

451
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,050
So it'd be like an about Angus Ari.
And then you would,

452
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,940
what year your kid was born in by
the first letter of his name. Wow.

453
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,270
That's how many kids are having.

454
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,380
So then you have girls and your girls
get to be the age of 14 and you've got a

455
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:56,730
pal. Like if I had a 14 year old kid
and I was a fundamentalist Mormon,

456
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,710
I feel like, Joe, why don't
you marry my daughter Laurie?

457
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:06,270
She just started bleeding and then I
would give her to you and you would

458
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:07,950
immediately start fucking her.

459
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,670
And so that's what they're
doing out there. It's like,

460
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:16,671
it's just like just herds and packs
of pregnant teenagers that have been

461
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:22,410
impregnated by these older
dudes who have so many wives.

462
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:25,440
And this shit is, I think it's
still going on today, man.

463
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:30,060
There's whole communities dedicated
to this polygamist lifestyle,

464
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:34,410
which is a lifestyle that Joseph Smith
said was one of the most important

465
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:38,790
aspects of Mormonism according to this
book. The other thing about Joseph Smith,

466
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,810
do you know what he did before
he found he founded Mormonism?

467
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,810
What he was what was called like a
treasure seeker and so you would use magic

468
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:53,391
stones to peer through to that would show
you our secret treasure was buried and

469
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:54,181
he,

470
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:58,260
there was a huge lawsuit against him
because he convinced all these people that

471
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,190
he could find Berridge pressure.

472
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,920
That was also what he said about the
golden tablets. Yeah, that was it.

473
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,290
He could use a seer stone and
see it through a magic rock.

474
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:10,800
That's how he could read the golden
tablets before he was doing the seer stone

475
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,160
and the angel a mower Moroni before
he's using the seer stone and the Angel

476
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,090
Moroni came to him. He was
actually getting work convincing
people like, hey look,

477
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:25,650
I've got a magic rock and there
and I can find your silver for you.

478
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,620
Because there was like a guy who hired
him because he knew that there was some

479
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:32,580
silver hidden up in the hills somewhere
and Joseph Smith went around with like

480
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,890
wards looking through the courts and
finally after like three months of hiring

481
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:41,370
him by the month, they took him
to court and they're like, hey,

482
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:45,600
this guy can't really find
treasure with that. Rock me. Well,

483
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,310
he's out there looking every day.

484
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,260
Wouldn't you have loved to seen like a
video of him talking of Joseph Smith,

485
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:56,850
like talking and explaining his strategies
and what he does and you know what

486
00:28:56,851 --> 00:29:00,670
Mormonism is all about. Yeah,
man. I mean, exactly. I just love,

487
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,870
I just love that idea of like,
uh,

488
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,890
that here's a man who was, look, come on,

489
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,490
let's just admit it.
Here's a man who's like,

490
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,350
just basically like a classic
con artists. Come on, man.

491
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,380
You're really telling people you
can find treasure with a rock.

492
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
No one's ever found treasure.

493
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:25,710
That's something like when I was in the
third grade that I would lie about to a

494
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:30,270
kid in the playground or something,
but this guy was making money off of it.

495
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,630
It's just very interesting to
see something grow roots and,

496
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:39,780
and flourish in the way that
that Mormonism has when,

497
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:44,300
when just with a very simple
investigation end of the, uh,

498
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,770
you've got lawsuits, there's written
records against Joseph Smith. Yeah.

499
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,490
Cause he was taken to court for lying.

500
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,910
No, no, no, no, no. But the angels really
did take the golden tablets. He really,

501
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,500
he really is the, the one he really
did find the loss work of Jesus.

502
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,210
He really can look at
it with a magic rock.

503
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,930
And for him it was always a magic
rock. Yeah. Magic rock. That was his,

504
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,670
that was his angle. It magic rocks.
But meanwhile, when we were in Utah,

505
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,740
we were in Utah the other day and
docking and I show up and when we arrive,

506
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,600
there was these hordes of people that
were waiting for these elders and the

507
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:27,600
elders of the young kids that
go away on a mission. Yeah.

508
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,110
All Mormons when they're
young or they're old,

509
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,260
they're supposed to go on these recruiting
missions as elders where they go,

510
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:36,960
they wear a suit and tie and they go to
third world countries or wherever they

511
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:41,520
go. Some of them go to third
world countries and they
recruit people and so these

512
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:46,110
guys were returning from their missions
and they were all like dolled up in

513
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:50,100
their finest suits and what their ties
on and when they showed up people just

514
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,600
scream and cheer and it was for Dunkin.

515
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,020
I was so strange because we were like
these weird heretics that are walking

516
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:01,050
through them were high.
We've got coffee in our hands.

517
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,620
They're not even allowed to drink
coffee. And so by the way, by the way,

518
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:05,220
by the way,

519
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,220
they're also one of the highest per capita
users of antidepressants because the

520
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,890
fact they're not allowed to drink
and not allowed to take coffee.

521
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,440
They are allowed to take
prescription medications. So weird.

522
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,110
They just chomped at shit.

523
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,990
Isn't that weird? Yeah, it's really weird.

524
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,500
Especially when when like sober people
like people who are like really into

525
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,570
being into sobriety or like chomping
on like Xanax and shit. And it's like,

526
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:31,210
what's the why? What's the difference
between that and booze? Really?

527
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,570
I know a woman who criticizes pot on
a regular, but she's very ignorant.

528
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,110
She Criticizes Pod, she takes his
Xanax every night to go to sleep.

529
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,300
She cannot sleep without a Xanax.

530
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,210
She'll take a Xanax and
that's how she goes to sleep.

531
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,380
Yeah, man, I, it's a really confused,
that's a very confusing issue.

532
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,310
Drugs are bad. I, that's why I love
Terence Mckenna's breakdown of that,

533
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:53,761
where he's like,

534
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:58,761
come on every morning we
are brewing a fucking drug.

535
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:04,101
We wake up every morning and we haven't
machines designed to extract alkaloids

536
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:08,970
from coffee beans that we put into our
bloodstream before we go to work every

537
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,090
morning. And that's not looked down
as strange at all. And not only that,

538
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:17,091
every labor contract is negotiated
with a break for this drug in it.

539
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,600
The coffee break. Yeah, but that doesn't
count. So when you tell people like, wait,

540
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:21,841
no,

541
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:26,841
really the entire planet or this it
North America wakes up slurps back a drug

542
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,660
every morning just to get ready to
go to their jobs and then they take,

543
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,320
what are they called?
Coffee breaks and coffee breaks.

544
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:36,570
If you were telling me like, Hey,
I'm going to go take a cocaine break,

545
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:41,000
do you mind if I call you gotta you
gotta fucking problem. Well, how about

546
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,670
fact that they're taking Xanax to go
to sleep and then they get drunk on the

547
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:44,840
weekend?

548
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,470
Well, yeah, you add on top of it that
they're getting drunk. They're taking, uh,

549
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,250
Xanax and pets. Very popular
nowadays. It's very popular.

550
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,840
I understand why it's, have you done
it? Yeah. What's it like? It's awesome.

551
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:01,820
You just like go to instantaneous,
like an instant relaxed. I'm trying to,

552
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:05,690
okay. Like, let me, I'll try to
think of a description of it. Okay.

553
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:10,550
Think about a night when you've had a
really good show and you wake up the next

554
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,900
morning and you're laying in bed, you've
had a good sleep, you're not hung over.

555
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,980
And it that dawning realization like,
man, that was a good show last night,

556
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:22,640
but you're still relaxed and
laying in bed and you're like, ah,

557
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,290
that's what Xanax does. Fau. Yeah,

558
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:29,220
just it's like the opposite
of any kind of anxiety or uh,

559
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,660
any kind of like tightening up.

560
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,070
You might have it gets rid of
that, but I've noticed that, uh,

561
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,880
there's a bit of a residual effect
with it. It's not a clean drug.

562
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:44,120
At least it hasn't been for me where
like a couple of days after you take it,

563
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:47,720
you feel kind of greasy and weird.
And when I've taken Xanax,

564
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:50,920
I've gotten the hiccups,
which is really strange. Yeah.

565
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,230
I'll start like having like Xanax hiccups.
The way I've heard it

566
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,700
bribed is that you, it, it, it
alleviates a lot of your anxiety,

567
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:02,330
but then it's almost like a rubber band.
It like snaps back.

568
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:06,680
It gives you more anxiety than you had
before. Um, my friend who takes it,

569
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,860
he tells me he has,

570
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,630
he takes it almost every day and
he can't get along without it.

571
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:14,660
He needs it like for anxiety.
He tells me when he gets off of it,

572
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:15,770
he gets really freaked out.

573
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,380
What the fuck is anxiety, man?
I, that's the reality. Yeah.

574
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:25,440
The reality of your life, the reality
of your body. This guy who, uh, is uh,

575
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,090
addicted to it, he takes
it every day. He's also a,

576
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,170
he's also overweight and he
also drinks too much. Right.

577
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,430
He's got issues and so he, I don't think
he likes to address those issues. Right.

578
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:40,640
And so instead of addressing those issues,
he says he has anxiety.

579
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,300
Man. There are certain things though that
were where anxiety is unavoidable, man.

580
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,200
I like,

581
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,030
I just think there's certain times that
emerge in your life where anxiety is not

582
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,890
all a lot of the time it's an
indication that you're fucking up. Yes.

583
00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:00,460
But sometimes it's just a natural
reaction to life. It's so high.

584
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

585
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Life itself. The inevitability of your
demise. There's no getting around it.

586
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,720
You know, the, the,

587
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,170
the ruthlessness of the day to day
grind can also give you anxiety.

588
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:13,740
The idea that even though it's Friday
and you're off of work, oh my God,

589
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:16,230
I'm going to have to go back there on
Monday and I'm gonna work eight to nine

590
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:18,970
hours, whatever I have to
do, including overtime,

591
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,850
and then I'm going to do it again
on Tuesday and then on Wednesday,

592
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:22,230
and then on Thursday,
and then Friday again,

593
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,970
and then I'm gonna get
a little break again.

594
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,890
And during that break I
got a lot of shit to do.

595
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:29,820
So it's not really a break and that just
that alone, as it accumulates over time,

596
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:30,654
then you start to,

597
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,610
you start to accumulate bills and you
start to accumulate responsibilities,

598
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,320
social responsibilities, responsibilities,
and the pressure of all that. Ken,

599
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:44,940
for Rick, you the fuck out
because it's a never ending.

600
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,680
Just a, a line of ants that goes on for
millions of miles. They're all tasks.

601
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,530
Every, every ant that you see
in front of you, every dot.

602
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,040
Every just like a million pages
is all things you have to do,

603
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,570
things you have to read. And it never
ends. If you have a job, a regular job,

604
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,260
especially, that's one of the reasons why
you should never, if you can avoid it,

605
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,070
never have a job. I mean, if you
need to have a job, get a job,

606
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,340
but if you could find something that
you love to do, you don't have a job,

607
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,500
then what you are is a lucky fuck. Yeah.
And then what you have is a cool gig.

608
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,131
You know,

609
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:21,510
like whether if you're a comedian or a
chef or a carpenter or something you love,

610
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,990
you know, a guy who builds motorcycles,
he loves it. He goes to work on grammar.

611
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,210
Yes. Anybody who loves
doing what they're doing,

612
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,350
that truly is the key to this life. And
everybody's just going to be different.

613
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,800
Your love is going to be different
than my love. You can't really judge,

614
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,380
can't judge what people like,
what they don't like.

615
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:39,750
You can judge what you like
and don't like, but you know,

616
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:44,280
it's like music tastes or tastes in food
or anything. Things are weird. You know,

617
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,770
things are weird and we vary wildly.
But yeah.

618
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,870
Yeah. The, the, the uh,
what I want to mention,

619
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,410
the idea I've been thinking about of uh,
um,

620
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:59,140
uh, it's called a temporal,
temporal peripheral vision,

621
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,030
temporal,
the temporal periphery.

622
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,950
So like humans develop peripheral vision
to deal with the predators so that it's

623
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:08,680
something to two at the, to our
side we could see a Predator coming.

624
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,220
And so we have this kind of like
side view that helps us out.

625
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,650
It's a very important thing.
Some animals don't have that.

626
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,410
They can only look straight forward,
right? But we have a, we're,

627
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:21,220
we can see off to the side a little
bit and that's a super important

628
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:25,310
evolutionary trait. Well, we also have
the exact same thing in the sense that,

629
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,940
but it's a temporal
peripheral vision where are,

630
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:31,180
we can think about the past and
we can think about the future.

631
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,250
And anxiety is always related to things
that we're looking at in the temporal

632
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,300
periphery. Nine Times out of 10, if
you come into the present moment,

633
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,490
you won't feel anxious.

634
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,790
You could be sitting in a doctor's
office about to go get your cat scan.

635
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:51,130
And if you could really pull yourself
just into the moment and what's happening

636
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:54,730
there, you wouldn't be,
you'd be 90% less afraid.

637
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,830
But the moment you step past that
sliver of the present moment,

638
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,400
that light beam and end of
the darkness of the future,

639
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,450
that's where the anxiety
pounds your fucking ass, man.

640
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:12,370
It's like touching an electric fence.
It's because things are always fine.

641
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,860
If you really look at it,
things are always fine.

642
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:18,760
Up until the Zombie rips your
intestines out of your stomach,

643
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,620
things are generally pretty
okay. You know that. That's the,

644
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:28,030
so that's the real conundrum. And
I think that's the, uh, the, um,

645
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,380
the thing that is so perplexing about
it being a human being, as you know,

646
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:35,140
that you're carrying around with you.
The ultimate,

647
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,940
which is the present moment,
but you can't stay in it.

648
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,760
You don't have the discipline
to stay there fully.

649
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,610
You're always wandering
off into the future,

650
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,570
always wandering off into what you
have to do, what's coming tomorrow,

651
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,320
what's coming in the next few minutes.
You know what I mean? It's so curious.

652
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:56,890
That right there in front
of us is the ultimate Xanax.

653
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,860
Well that's why the the shallow
feelings of materialism, you know,

654
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:02,060
what is materialism?

655
00:39:02,061 --> 00:39:07,061
Well it's fixating on objects to fill
up your attention span for fixating on

656
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,480
them instead of all the other shit that
you could be thinking about instead of

657
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,470
you. You're your own designing your
own personal philosophy for life,

658
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,980
finding out what you like and don't
like about your past behavior and

659
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:22,100
incorporating it into the present.
Living in that moment,

660
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,050
being aware of what's
happening and managing it
correctly. All that's too much.

661
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,580
So you start thinking about the future.

662
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:32,330
I'd love to have a house that's like
6,000 square feet and I want to have 50

663
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:35,780
acres of land. I want to be on top of a
mountain and I want to have gun ports,

664
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,800
you know, start, you just start counting
points. You know what I'm saying?

665
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,160
You start like thinking about shit.
Cause if those motherfuckers come,

666
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:40,920
I'm going to be ready.

667
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,260
And instead of like being like right
there in that moment or you start thinking

668
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:48,710
about you know what a piece of shit you
were when you were a little kid and he

669
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:49,580
used to yell at your mother.

670
00:39:49,581 --> 00:39:52,580
You mean you could start thinking about
weird shit and it could fill up your

671
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:57,581
present and it's part of being a human
being is managing the thought that that

672
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:02,990
you hold on to managing what you,
what you gravitate towards.

673
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:06,740
It's so hard to do if you
just got fired from a job,

674
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:11,450
it's very difficult to see the silver
lining you like shit. You just,

675
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,170
that feeling of getting just fucking
kicked out of a job and someone doesn't

676
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:19,430
want you work. Then when you are a failure
you failed and you're like, Oh God,

677
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,650
it's so hard to go. Come on,
let's go and have a good time.

678
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,020
Like you don't want to have a good time.

679
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,370
You feel fucking terrible
that much because it's also,

680
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,040
there's a dance going on, a
balancing act, if you will.

681
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:36,041
And that balancing act is you got to
learn from the fuck ups and the only way

682
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,990
you really learn is to
feel like shit and you,

683
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:43,460
it's best if you feel like shit for a
while because then it really sinks in.

684
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:45,560
The can't show up an hour late every day.

685
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,930
You can't smell like whiskey
after your lunch break.

686
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,330
You can't yell at your boss
because you're, you know,

687
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,310
you've got to have a hangover
and you're crabby that day.

688
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,860
You can't do those things
because you can get fired.

689
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,680
And when you get fired at fucking sucks.

690
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,950
But every time I've ever gotten fired
in my whole life, why fucked up?

691
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:05,270
And I got fired. I made like an
evolutionary jump as a person after that.

692
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,090
Absolutely.
Yeah.

693
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:10,740
Every stupid thing that I've ever done
that's resulted in disaster has always

694
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:12,330
made me a million times better.

695
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,280
And why is that?

696
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,420
Because you have a terrible feeling
and you don't want to have that feeling

697
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:21,530
again. So it's forcing you to really
focus on whatever the hell it is.

698
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,670
Well, this is the, this is the, this is,

699
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,650
I mean it's something that you
don't want to accept. You know,

700
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:29,431
you want it to be,

701
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:34,130
you want the universe to be
something that's more or something

702
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,980
that's that that's more compassionate,

703
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:41,390
but it really does seem
like a huge portion of what
makes people great is their

704
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:46,391
ability to overcome internal difficulties
or external difficulties andF and

705
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:51,830
failure and, and, and that's something
that wouldn't, you're failing.

706
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:56,180
It won't give you any, it won't help you
when you're failing thinking like, oh,

707
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,100
this is,
I guess this is helping me.

708
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:01,160
I guess it does relieve some of the
pain of the thing when you realize that

709
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:03,700
you're in a kiln and you're
the failures that heat,

710
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,990
that sort of transforming
you into something.

711
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,400
Yeah. There's, I think that
it's, the feelings are there,

712
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:16,401
are they have they serve
like an evolutionary purpose
or a purpose that's in

713
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,170
line with progress.

714
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,320
A purpose that's in line with moving
forward and taking things to a next level,

715
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,810
which is why where we
always feel at at our best.

716
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,290
I always find that one of the reasons
why I try to like do like a lot of things

717
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:35,940
at once as cause I like figuring things
out and I like when things get better.

718
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,610
I like when a joke that I'm
working on becomes better.

719
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,620
I like when it grows and becomes real.

720
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,590
Not like when you write something down
then you add to it and then it becomes

721
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:48,090
better. I like getting better at a
skill, like a martial art or a game.

722
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,680
I love getting, I love getting better at
video games. It's a great feeling. Yeah,

723
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,690
and if you're not getting
better at things, if you're not,

724
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:57,330
if you don't have some sort
of improvement in movement,

725
00:42:57,331 --> 00:43:00,660
if that's not the general trend
that you find your life in,

726
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:06,030
I find that I don't feel happy. I find
that that greatly affects my happiness.

727
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,140
And I also find that's one of the most
difficult things to achieve if and when

728
00:43:10,141 --> 00:43:14,730
you have a job that you don't
enjoy because the majority
of your time and focus

729
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:18,530
during the day, they take all your best
hours. Man, you think about what a job is,

730
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:22,110
a nine to five they take the
hours that you are the most awake,

731
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,700
the most tuned in, the most aware
of, the most focused on the world.

732
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,340
So if you want to figure out
how to get out of your job,

733
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,430
you got to take your weakest time.
That's all they give you.

734
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,640
They give you your time where you're
the most tired and most likely to sit in

735
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:39,180
from the TV and the most likely to just
have a beer the most likely to take a

736
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:41,820
nap. They give you those
times and they say, all right,

737
00:43:41,821 --> 00:43:44,370
you want to get out of this
fucking system. Here's your time.

738
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:44,911
Well,

739
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:49,500
this is why I like chanting and I think
chanting is a fantastic tool that you

740
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:54,501
can use in those times because chanting
something that you can do at work to get

741
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:58,770
fired. No, you do it in your
mind. You don't say it out loud,

742
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:01,940
but in your mind you can
start doing a mantra. Um,

743
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,590
you definitely don't have
to say mantras out loud.

744
00:44:04,591 --> 00:44:08,970
You could just say it in your mind
so that, uh, in the midst of, uh,

745
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,500
when stress comes,

746
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,160
you can actually start training yourself
to start doing a mantra inside of your

747
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:17,160
mind and said, cause normally can't
do that if you're working. Sure.

748
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,710
If you have to interact with people
and you have a good deal while you're

749
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:23,370
talking to people, I'm doing it right
now. I could do it right now. My mind,

750
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,010
I can definitely write down how are
you doing that if you're going to

751
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:30,380
concentrate on what you're doing because
it's something. Yeah. Can you give Audis?

752
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,200
Yeah. Can you, can you what,

753
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,340
which Duncan, am I talking to
you right now? Can you, um,

754
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,500
do you think you could give
something your full attention,

755
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:40,290
like a job while you were chanting in
the back of your head at the same time?

756
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,260
Honestly, the next time you find yourself
in the midst of like working, you know,

757
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,290
doing some mundanity and of your
whatever it is, right? Watch,

758
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,740
become mindful and you will see that
some percentage of us focused on the task

759
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:59,890
at hand. But then another part of you
is always thinking, always thinking,

760
00:44:59,891 --> 00:45:01,130
always processing,

761
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,960
always a whole other conversation is
always going on in people's minds.

762
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:08,380
It's an inevitability, you know, and some
people have more focused than others,

763
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,960
but in general there's always that,
uh,

764
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,770
that part of the mind that's like
an electric wire and a puddle.

765
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:19,090
There's just sort of skipping around
and spraying out random thoughts.

766
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,460
Well that's the part of your bind,
that chance,

767
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,420
that's the part of your mind
that you begin to train to
start doing it. A mantra,

768
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:28,780
which is like a simple mantra.
So that that thing, if you can,

769
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,090
instead of it being like,
ah man,

770
00:45:31,091 --> 00:45:34,630
what the fuck got out of the cat scan
doesn't mean I have cancer. Jesus Christ,

771
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:39,300
man, I wish my ges was wider. I fucking
hate that song or whatever. Whatever.

772
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,580
Here you, whatever your mind
is stupidly spraying up,

773
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,070
you start training that when you can.
They would go

774
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,230
rom mom, mom, mom, mom,

775
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,360
and you read it. It's like throwing a
dog. A bone. What? What? Why Rom Rom Ron.

776
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:56,490
Was it just a sound? Just bad? It's
a mantra that people recommend.

777
00:45:56,491 --> 00:45:58,110
It's cause it's got the on minute,

778
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:01,530
but it also has this nice
little are that you can wrong,

779
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,380
wrong,
wrong.

780
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,270
Do you think that people who have
like ADHD or isn't Ada, which, which,

781
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,510
which is the one that the guy on his
deathbed said isn't real? Is it Adhd?

782
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,740
Like add is real, but the guy who
created the Adhd said it was bullshit.

783
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,900
I don't know. Yeah, that's it's
Adhd is that one? Yeah. What did,

784
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,810
what was exactly what happened? He
was on his deathbed. He's like, ah.

785
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,950
I was just bullshitting.

786
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,980
Yeah. I wonder if he was being serious
about it or if it was just because he was

787
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:29,140
crazy. How is fucked? Right, right.

788
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,910
Yeah.
What,

789
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,440
what is the difference to add his
attention deficit disorder and Adhd,

790
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:39,240
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
isn't it? How much of the, I mean, how,

791
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:43,560
how accurate is their prognosis
or the diagnosis of add?

792
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,660
Because so often they're dealing
with kids and kids are bored as fuck,

793
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,330
you know,
and it's not because they have a disease.

794
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,240
It's because you're making them
do something boring as fuck.

795
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,520
Like I know because I have children,

796
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:59,520
I watch how how they
develop as like little,

797
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,770
little people sort of learning
how to get through things.

798
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,310
It's difficult for them to sit down.
They got fucking energy.

799
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,890
They want to dance and play and have fun.
They want to throw things and,

800
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:12,240
and wrestle with each other and play.
When you make them sit,

801
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,560
even if they're 10 or 12 there's
still juiced up with life.

802
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,430
And if you make them sit and just
do things, they get fucking bored.

803
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,710
And they know that what they're
doing is not as fun as baseball.

804
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,290
They know what they're doing is not
as fun as the video game that they're

805
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,243
addicted to.

806
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,320
They know it's not as fun as playing
with their friends when school's over so

807
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:30,010
they can't wait to get the

808
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,410
fuck out of there. And then you say,
well this boy has got a disease. Well,

809
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,750
no they don't.
You're,

810
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,080
you're offering them shit sandwiches and
they're not hungry. Yeah, no shit. I,

811
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,330
and that's why I think it's a funny term,

812
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,340
attention deficit disorder because these
kids, there's no deficits in attention.

813
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,770
There's uh, there's uh, maybe a,

814
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:52,750
it's a attention control disorder in the
sense that they can't control what they

815
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:53,950
focus their mind on.

816
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:59,190
I know I have an attention control this
order because I can be sitting on my

817
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,550
porch and then like look down at my phone
and not look up for another 15 minutes.

818
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,350
Okay,
but stop right there because you don't,

819
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,250
because if it's something that
you really love, like starcraft,

820
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,640
you can fucking lock on
to that shit for hours.

821
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,080
You can tune in with 100%
of your being for hours.

822
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,820
That's not an attention deficit disorder.
What you have is a love of starcraft,

823
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:26,970
which you have is you find the one thing
that you do just fucking really vibe on

824
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,660
and you chase after that five on
sounded very seventies. No, it's true.

825
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:36,280
Mantle family on everybody. But I think
that it's a, I, if I had my, if I could,

826
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,600
I would much rather, and maybe this
is an impossibility or fantasy,

827
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,820
but I'd much rather have the ability to
lock my attention on anything I wanted

828
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:50,170
to with the exact same level that
gets locked on to things that I enjoy.

829
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,930
Because I think if I could do
that, then I would be able to. Uh,

830
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:59,290
but you can, if you actually enjoy
it, if you actually enjoy it, you can.

831
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,940
Yeah. But certain things like books, uh,

832
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,010
like especially like really long novels.

833
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:10,430
Like I'm just listening to the stand,
the Stephen King audio, but Stan,

834
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:14,350
or it's good, but I'll tell
you the first like two hours,

835
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,650
there's a lot of shit in
there that doesn't involve
people coughing up sprays of

836
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:25,231
thick briny plague mucus and wandering
through an apocalyptic wasteland.

837
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,500
There's just a lot of character
development. That's not that fun, right?

838
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:30,131
But you need,

839
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:34,120
you need to focus on that because it
brings the characters to life more a

840
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:38,920
Kendall's the fire of the story. So
it's like sir, you know, and also,

841
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,350
uh, running, you know,

842
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:46,351
and I go jogging the first 30 minutes
or 20 minutes aren't exactly a blast.

843
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,040
Like my mind is going everywhere.

844
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,890
But then this thing will kick in
where suddenly you're like, ah,

845
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,300
this is fucking amazing. It
feels so good. But to get there,

846
00:49:55,301 --> 00:50:00,010
you need to get through the first 30
minutes or however long of not enjoying it

847
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,810
or fucking Jujitsu. And I was taking
Jujitsu with Eddie Bravo, man,

848
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:06,760
that wasn't my mind was everywhere.

849
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:10,690
And like I know if I just had the
ability to focus on that for a year,

850
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,870
then that would have
radically transformed my life.

851
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:19,050
So that's why I say I wish that I could
figure out a way to make my mind become

852
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,930
immersed in anything that I want it to
instead of what it wanted to get immersed

853
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:28,190
in it. You still can,
not only can you still

854
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:28,911
do it, you, you,

855
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:33,470
what you described is the very difficult
aspects of things that you really enjoy.

856
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,050
It's a,
a subset or a,

857
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:41,051
another aspect of how you like find
what you enjoy and make what you enjoy

858
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:45,830
better. And that that involves doing
things that you don't enjoy at all.

859
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,150
It involves work.

860
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,590
And that's the weird sort of thing that
happens to kids when they learn a sport

861
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,150
or they learn a martial art or you know,
you,

862
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,310
you try out for the wrestling team
or something when you realize like,

863
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,260
I love wrestling,
but to get really good at wrestling,

864
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,090
you gotta go through wrestling
practice and that's a mother fucker.

865
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,220
And that's like this thing that
you learned in life. But you know,

866
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:10,040
when you're dealing with something
that you want to describe as attention

867
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:14,600
deficit disorder, that I don't think that
applies to that. I think all that is,

868
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:19,601
is a conditioning of discipline and a
recognition that discipline is like a mode

869
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,080
that you can put your mind
into and that you can achieve.

870
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,660
And it's also one of
those things where if you,

871
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,400
you have a characteristic that
you cultivate on a regular basis,

872
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:35,700
then it becomes a part of who you
are. If you get used to, uh, an act,

873
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:36,700
do you get used to have it?

874
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:40,550
All you have to do is do something for
90 days and that will become who you are.

875
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,600
You say, I'm going to take yoga every
day for 90 days. It seems impossible.

876
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,340
People had been doing it for years.
You can do it.

877
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:49,820
Just get up every morning at eight
o'clock whenever the fuck the class is and

878
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:51,140
take it for 90 days.

879
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,980
You will be a fucking Yogi
by the end of those 90 days.

880
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,000
That will be who you are, right? But
how many people ever actually do that?

881
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,510
That's the,
the discipline that that life requires.

882
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:06,560
And that's one of the lessons that
you learn once you apply yourself to

883
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:09,500
something. You learn how to
develop your human potential.

884
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,340
And one of the ways of developing
is a force yourself into and through

885
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:17,570
situations. But you're, you still
love the things that you love,

886
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,000
like video games,
like doing standup comedy,

887
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,000
things that don't require
the discipline at all.

888
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:26,210
You still pursue them and
have this passion for them.

889
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,420
It's just there's other stuff
too that's not on the surface.

890
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,430
You just have to work to get to it.
Got To get good at Jujitsu.

891
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,460
Fucking sucked when I
first started doing it,

892
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,020
but I knew that these guys were way
better than me and they were an immortal.

893
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,460
There were just people who practice more,
right? So in getting killed, I realized,

894
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,460
Ooh, if I just keep doing this, I can
eventually do that to someone else.

895
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,320
And when I first started playing quake,
same thing. I was getting crushed.

896
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,710
I would go online and spin around in
circles and dude would shoot rockets into

897
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:56,870
my face.
It was a terrible feeling.

898
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,380
And then I've learned how to
get really good at it because

899
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:04,300
I know, yeah, same was star craft.
Man tries starting that shit off, man.

900
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:07,210
You'll get your ass handed to
you. I still do. By the way,

901
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,400
everybody starcraft people out there,

902
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,320
I should make this very
important announcement.

903
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:16,710
This Friday at 1:00 PM I
will be a live streaming,

904
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,640
a match between me and Pendleton ward,

905
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,040
the creator of adventure time.
It was a play.

906
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,060
Starcraft kicked my ass
the last time we played.

907
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:32,210
We're having a rematch and it's being
cast by our tosas and Jeff Robinson who

908
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:36,960
are these like professional starcraft
casters and there's a caster.

909
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:38,940
What does that mean?
It's like what you do for the UFC,

910
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:41,840
but they do it for Starrco,
a broadcast, a broadcast.

911
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,230
So when you're playing starcraft,
they will do commentary on your strategy.

912
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,550
And me and Pendleton suck so bad.

913
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:53,580
So it'd be like you casting a UFC with,

914
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,380
with like me to go in Ra fighting.
Yeah, it'd be, yeah. It's like just,

915
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,700
we're not good at all,

916
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:04,020
but it's cool to get these two like
super professional casters to do it.

917
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:07,380
So that's at 1:00 PM Pacific Time.

918
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:10,230
I think it's going to be on twitch TV,
but I'll tweet about it.

919
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:12,990
For those of you who like star craft,
you can watch us flail.

920
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,650
Don't get an as eating, drinking the
mountain dew and eating no Doritos.

921
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,040
He's slowly,
I could imagine a cat thing.

922
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:24,180
I think that game is like one of those.
I think starcraft,

923
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:27,130
like you have to be on the ball all
the time. Correct me if I'm wrong.

924
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,510
You have to be the whole time. You
can't be like eating chips, right? No,

925
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:34,980
you can't eat fucking chips if you're,
if you're going to play a real game of,

926
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,030
sorry, you got to eat your cashews and
drink your coke and then he start playing.

927
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,260
You might be able to take some swigs of
water and the first four minutes or so

928
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:45,520
when you're building up your
army and your little circle,

929
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:47,730
things are just beginning to grow,

930
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:52,020
but you got ten six
basically. It's all time, man.

931
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,230
I'm not going to get an a starcraft.
I was with Dunkin in Utah.

932
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,750
We had a long drive to and from location.

933
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:01,890
It was like two hours from the airport
and we got into a starcraft conversation

934
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,310
and the passion in his voice,

935
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:09,000
when he describes
starcraft, it's like, man,

936
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,950
if you put that much effort into
anything else in your life, it becomes,

937
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,850
this is a real problem is that those
things don't pay off. You know,

938
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:21,210
they don't give you anything back.
No, I get really awesome at them,

939
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,450
but then at the end of the
day you don't have a car.

940
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,780
You don't have a house to show that
you're the best tennis player. No Man.

941
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:32,130
Pete Sampras like that guy has a
giant ass house. But like you know,

942
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:35,070
if you become like the motherfucker
had starcraft, how much can you make?

943
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,240
What are the best pro star
craft guys make $40 dude,

944
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,030
I have no that.
I think they make real money.

945
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,790
I know they can make you can make
real money. I think I'm wrong.

946
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,280
If you go to team liquid,
I,

947
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,950
I've saw somewhere there was a listing
of like how much like in fact when the

948
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,083
Pete,
when they,

949
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,780
when players start playing in
tournaments as part of their credits,

950
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:57,420
they will show the amount of money that
they've won over the course of their

951
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:01,810
career play. Wow. So you could see
how much money these people want,

952
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:05,100
but it's look professional.
Starcraft as a young man's game.

953
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:10,101
This is for somebody who's neurology
hasn't been frazzled by countless hits of

954
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:14,820
LSD and nitrous oxide.
It's like you've got to have like quick,

955
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:18,960
quick fucking what's called APM,
which is actions per minute.

956
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,670
Will they love this stuff?
By the way,

957
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,160
Alpha brain would definitely go over well
with some of these people who play the

958
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:27,670
game. I play the game just
for just for fun. I mean it's,

959
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:32,850
but I do recognize the time suck that
it is an inevitably when I'm playing,

960
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,460
I'll look at my watch and think,

961
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,050
why were you not writing
for the last two hours?

962
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,240
We just been running purple things
all over a screen for two hours.

963
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,800
Doesn't do anything for you. It
gets you, it does do something for,

964
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:53,640
I shouldn't say that because it has been
proven that it has a positive effect on

965
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:57,190
cognitive function. Okay.
It strengthens your, uh,

966
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,900
strengthens your decision
making abilities. Yeah.

967
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,810
And it makes your brain fire at
a rapid pace. They, for real,

968
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,190
they've figured this out with video games,
right?

969
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:10,230
That you're dealing with intense series
of things going on and you're managing

970
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:12,090
them and it's like an
exercise for your mind.

971
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:17,220
I just think it's a drug and I think that
it's like some drugs have benefits and

972
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:20,710
I think that it's a digital drug
and I think that when you're,

973
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,590
when you're playing so that,
you know,

974
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,290
when I'm playing a video
game for a long time, uh,

975
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,640
for a really long time, like if it's,
when I was addicted to world of Warcraft,

976
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:32,980
which I'd, I'm not anymore,
I don't play anymore.

977
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,930
But when I was due to
the world of Warcraft,

978
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:36,820
which was a true video game addiction,

979
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,740
and I think about spending a couple
of days playing that game is the main

980
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,150
activity in my day.

981
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,210
I don't really see much of a difference
in physical activity between me and

982
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:54,211
somebody who just got on the spike
and shot some heroin into his veins.

983
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:58,090
You know, I, he's going to be sitting
on the couch nodding in and out.

984
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:03,460
I'm going to be sitting on my chair
focused on a fantasy world and clicking

985
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:07,600
buttons. But our caloric, we're
not burning a lot of calories.

986
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,420
We're just kind of sitting in
a, in other words, if that team,

987
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:15,421
if my monitor was turned off and I was
just sitting there doing the same thing,

988
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,130
I might as well be,
it's like heroin,

989
00:58:18,131 --> 00:58:20,620
except that I don't have a chemical
inside of me. So it's a drug,

990
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,220
it's a fucking drug.
And when the rift comes out,

991
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,790
when these new oculus rift, yeah,
man, when that shit comes out,

992
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:31,300
people are going to have to accept the
fact that we found another way to get

993
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,134
high.

994
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,200
That's as easy as addictive and
potentially life destroying is any other

995
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:38,584
hardcore narc.

996
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,270
Well, you keep hearing about these people
that abandon their babies because they,

997
00:58:42,271 --> 00:58:44,970
uh, they've been playing a video game
and they let their kids starve to death.

998
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:49,170
You hear about that shit all the time.
It's happened several times. And you know,

999
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,520
these, these video games are only
getting more and more powerful.

1000
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,810
So their impact,

1001
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,040
what you're getting now is way stronger
than anybody ever got from monopoly and

1002
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:03,360
Pong. You know? And then when Pong
became, you know, the PAC man,

1003
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:07,140
and then when pac man became, when you're
dealing with now something that's way,

1004
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:11,220
way, way, way, way more powerful.
And the question comes up is,

1005
00:59:11,221 --> 00:59:14,760
are we really designed to handle
that kind of stimulation? Right?

1006
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:19,820
Our brains are set up for a whole series
of rewards that we get for finding

1007
00:59:20,551 --> 00:59:22,040
food. You find a rabbit, you shoot it,

1008
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,490
then you get to eat. You know, there's
that thrill of catching it and eating it.

1009
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,530
Well,
it said of rabbits,

1010
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:30,620
you're doing swords or whatever the fuck
you're doing and you're serving your

1011
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:35,290
deserves. You're sending your troops over
this three d mountain range. You know,

1012
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,650
you're setting a trap.

1013
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:40,640
On the other end and they retreat so you
can attack from the back end as well.

1014
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:44,480
Yeah, it'd be evil, evil to
touch it. I don't want to
fuck with you. I love it man.

1015
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:47,480
That's exactly what you just described
as a great strategy and that's part of

1016
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:50,360
the fun of the game is like you
start learning new strategies.

1017
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,550
There's cheese strategies
is what they're called,

1018
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:55,910
which is like leave out a trout when
you attack within the first six minutes

1019
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,320
it's like, oh or four minutes. There's
lane, it's lame and cheese is lame.

1020
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:03,800
So like Ah, there's, there's
like some like you can,

1021
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,550
instead of spending your
time building a giant army,

1022
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,990
if within the first five minutes you
can build a very small army and get that

1023
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:13,370
into your enemies base,

1024
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,820
taking them by surprise and they
haven't built up any defense,

1025
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,900
then you can sometimes defeat your enemy
within the first five minutes of the

1026
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:23,390
game because they weren't
prepared for what's called a rush.

1027
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:28,400
And that's called a cheese attack and
it pisses people off and it's so fun to

1028
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:29,600
Piss people off when you're playing.

1029
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:33,050
Cause then they'll chat to you
like you fucking new piece of shit.

1030
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:33,911
What are you doing?

1031
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:37,410
Cause they get really mad cause
it's lame cause it's just a lie.

1032
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:41,060
Is it lame though? It seems like it's
an option. Well it's lame because it's,

1033
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:44,540
it's it and I used to not,
I used to think,

1034
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,720
I used to think like you think and because
I would love to do cheese attacks and

1035
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:50,560
I thought it was funny but
you don't do it anymore.

1036
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,730
You want to be taken seriously.
I don't want to be taking seriously.

1037
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:55,100
I enjoy the game more
when I have bigger armies.

1038
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:58,640
It's more fun when you like have to
deal with more variables and you let the

1039
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:02,570
thing expand to like the,
the game is divided into phases.

1040
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:06,530
So it's like mid game and game and the
beginning of the game and each of these

1041
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:07,340
phases,

1042
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:10,460
there's different strategies that you
employ according to what your enemies

1043
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:13,160
doing. It's kind of boring
looking though, you know,

1044
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:16,610
I mean I won't argue with that. A little
dudes are like, there are no big deal.

1045
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:17,900
They're not very distinctive.

1046
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,980
I like how they explode when you
shoot out him and still back to that.

1047
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,710
What was that?
So look what we have here is I can't,

1048
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:29,390
I can't see very well, it appears that we
have Taryn, these are Terrans attacking.

1049
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:32,900
I can't tell what those fucking,
they turn into like little red puddles,

1050
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:37,000
the explode when you shoot at some odd
Dunkin Zombie Mod. Oh, it's a Zombie.

1051
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,780
Oh Wow. Starcraft Zombie mode. That looks
fun. So that's Terrans attacking zombies.

1052
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,060
There are zombies that
are actually in the game,

1053
01:01:44,061 --> 01:01:47,860
but I've never seen those zombies before.
I wish it was um,

1054
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,100
more first person.

1055
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,450
I wish you have the opportunity to go
first person and then above just for the

1056
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:56,350
visual enjoyment of it kind of cooler.
Really cool.

1057
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,420
I keep praying that blizzard releases
some version of it where each member of

1058
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:05,300
the armies can be somebody
else playing like halo styles.

1059
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:09,710
So each of the armies are
like each individual troop
is being controlled by some

1060
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:14,280
other players somewhere else. Oh Wow.
Fucking awesome. That be crazy. So you,

1061
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,400
you literally would be an army of people.

1062
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:18,740
How many people would you get
it into a game then? Well, you,

1063
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,380
you can only get a maximum of 200 units,
so or,

1064
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,050
or 200.
Not 200 units,

1065
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:29,400
but it's like 200 supply is what
it's called because for every, uh,

1066
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:34,710
every unit requires like for uh,
the Zerg to create units. You,

1067
01:02:34,711 --> 01:02:36,780
you'll Max out your unit.
So you start off,

1068
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:39,750
you can only have 10 units on the board
and then you have to build a thing

1069
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:42,660
called an overlord.
And for each overlord you get an,

1070
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,430
you can build another five units.

1071
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:48,750
So you could have a potentially
200 people as individuals.

1072
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:52,380
200 different individuals logged into
a server. Well it wouldn't be at 200,

1073
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:52,981
but it would be like,

1074
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:57,720
you could have like 130 or
150 or something because a
certain units and anyway,

1075
01:02:57,721 --> 01:02:59,610
it's like it would be fucking wild.

1076
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,910
It would be of 150 people
online representing a team.

1077
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,410
I mean is that what's going
to happen with oculus rifts?

1078
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:07,740
That seems like that would
be totally possible, I think.

1079
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:11,070
I think that is going to happen with
Oculus rift and I think that, uh,

1080
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,400
how many people are going to die
having heart attacks play on that,

1081
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,830
playing that and probably not many,
but oculus rift having sex.

1082
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,570
But what about the running with the
fucking running on the fucking Omni

1083
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,150
Directional treadmills? Yeah, on the
Omni. Yeah. You're, no, you're right.

1084
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:27,360
I mean I think that's going to be one of
the problems that we see is people are

1085
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:30,720
going to get sick and people are
going to like go into cardiac arrest.

1086
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:32,430
People are going to have
the most amazing legs ever.

1087
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,770
People are going to be ripped,
but they're getting there.

1088
01:03:34,771 --> 01:03:37,200
People are going to be using,
this is something that uh,

1089
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,640
Silva was talking about and he had a
word for like the mixture of certain

1090
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:46,470
psychedelics and video games. Silva who?
Jason Silva, Jason Silva, he had this,

1091
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:50,370
uh, he was talking about some kind of
mix of psychedelics and video games.

1092
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:53,040
So it's like not only are you
going to be putting the rift on,

1093
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:58,140
but you're going to be taking
some synthetic drug that
helps you merge into the

1094
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:02,150
video game more so that you can merge
into it more. You get deeper into it.

1095
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,200
Maybe it'll just be marijuana bath salts,

1096
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,980
but you're going to smack that fucking
riffed on man and I haven't seen much

1097
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:11,700
mention of of porn yet with the
Oculus riff, but come on man.

1098
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:14,550
Think about first person porn.

1099
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:18,320
They film the first porn
with the Google glass. Yeah,

1100
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,540
some guy film porn with Google
glass. There you go, man.

1101
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,220
I don't think Jo would like starcraft.

1102
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:26,900
I think you'd be more like like
a battlefield for battlefield.

1103
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,670
His battlefield where there's
tons of people playing out.

1104
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:31,680
Well that's way better balance.
You're in that direct.

1105
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:34,230
You're in three d like this
so you can get in planes,

1106
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:36,400
you can get in tanks [inaudible] me.

1107
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:40,920
This to me speaks to me as like an
individual, like as a human being,

1108
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:43,620
experiencing life.
Like I know I'm just in a video game,

1109
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:46,980
but you're running around with a machine
gun. You're flying around in a plane,

1110
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:50,580
it's like you're seeing it from the
point of view of an actual player when

1111
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:53,340
you're looking at it above.
I'm sure it's really cool,

1112
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,350
but it lacks that feeling
like it's actually happening.
It's apples and oranges.

1113
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:02,130
It's, it's chess versus quake itself,
a whole different thing. You're,

1114
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:06,030
you're controlling, you know, it's
multitasking to the nth degree.

1115
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:09,210
Makes them with planning and
mixed them with strategy,

1116
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:10,920
with these kinds of first person shooters.

1117
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:14,430
You're dealing with a whole different
type of gameplay and there those are

1118
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:16,740
fucking fun, man. Let me,
I was just telling Brian,

1119
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:20,450
I can wait for the new grand theft auto.
Yeah.

1120
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:25,930
Wow. That looks amazing. And that's not
even on the new generation of consoles,

1121
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:28,870
man. That's just a, that's
a, uh, that's on the,

1122
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,820
we'll have access to that in a few
months and it looks so fun and I,

1123
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:36,550
there's like a giant
forest in it I've heard.

1124
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,710
And there's rumors that there's a big
foot that lives in the floor. Yeah.

1125
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:46,210
That's awesome. I know, man. I can't
wait. Did you ever play quake, uh,

1126
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,070
like a dual? Did you ever
do doubles with quake? Yeah,

1127
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:53,440
duals are fascinating because they got
it down to when they know when weapons

1128
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:56,950
would respond. So the whole key
to a duel was controlling the map.

1129
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,720
You had to know where
the rocket launcher is.

1130
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,210
You got to get to the guy before
the rocket launcher respond.

1131
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,250
You had to make sure that
he never got a good weapon.

1132
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,800
So all you have is like a
little blaster when you spawn.

1133
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,710
And then if somebody kills you and
they're all armored up and they're filled

1134
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:10,510
with weapons,
they can fuck you up.

1135
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,900
And the key is like you got to figure
out a way to kill that guy while he's all

1136
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:15,280
armored up.
It's very,

1137
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:19,900
very difficult and it becomes like this
massive dual to get to various strong

1138
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:23,740
spots on the map. Where's the armor?
Where's the the rail gun? Where's this?

1139
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:24,574
And where's that?

1140
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,640
It's so fun. And it's so funny,
the way to fun. Unfortunately, I,

1141
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:34,690
I'd actually deleted my fucking star
craft so funny two nights ago to lead and

1142
01:06:35,361 --> 01:06:37,360
stark.
So many times I tried again.

1143
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:41,590
I deleted starcraft and then
Pendleton texted me and he's like, uh,

1144
01:06:41,591 --> 01:06:45,580
w w w I want to come over on Friday
and kick your ass. It starcraft again.

1145
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:50,230
And then it's like, oh fuck you man,
we'll play. Because I played Pendleton.

1146
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:52,400
I didn't know that he knew how to play.
Oh,

1147
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,380
I got really cocky and was like
being lazy and fucking around.

1148
01:06:56,381 --> 01:06:58,780
And then he likes stomped my ass.

1149
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:02,320
He like crushed me and them
in the most horrible way.

1150
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:05,290
So I wasn't prepared for that. I
thought he was like, just, just a,

1151
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:09,280
just started playing. And you know what
I think he had, that's a pathetic thing.

1152
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:13,180
That's how bad I suck. It started
just started playing and he got back.

1153
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:17,980
He's just really a really, really smart
guy. I mean, have you seen adventure time?

1154
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:21,390
Yeah, it's genius. So when you do it, um,

1155
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,410
it's possible for someone to just
learn like right away. No, not me. I,

1156
01:07:26,411 --> 01:07:28,600
I'm,
I've been playing now for like,

1157
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,110
you can learn the basics
pretty few years and I just,

1158
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,750
I'm still on the silver league.
The silver league.

1159
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,180
I just got out of the bronze league,
which is the lowest league.

1160
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:41,040
It's just such a Dork. I gotta pee.
I'll be right back. All right, sorry.

1161
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,150
Hey everybody.
Hi.

1162
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,500
I had a pizza, but I've been
holding it in, but that's cool.

1163
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:49,500
You go and then we'll go.
Have you seen this, um,

1164
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,150
this new campaign about pornography?
They,

1165
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:56,100
somebody sent it to me on Twitter
at pornography is the new drug.

1166
01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:00,150
Like this is the new drug and that,
and it's like fight, fight or blog.

1167
01:08:00,151 --> 01:08:03,330
Like they're fighting pornography.
It's like fight or blog and fighter.

1168
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:07,740
It's very odd. It's a w what are,
what are they saying? Well, you know,

1169
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:10,710
they're essentially saying things that
people have always said about pornography,

1170
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:14,820
that people get addicted to, that it can
affect your relationships. And yet, Ken,

1171
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:19,130
with some people, but it's another one
of those things. It's just like TV,

1172
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:23,990
booze, cigarettes, any it fill in the
blank, right? It's like, yeah, yeah.

1173
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:25,370
You could just jerk off all day.

1174
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,340
And sometimes that happens to all
of us for like a week, you know,

1175
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:30,320
especially when you're single,
you know when you were single,

1176
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:32,510
like you could easily when you're live.

1177
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:34,100
But when I lived by
myself and I was single,

1178
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:36,950
I can easily have jerked off twice
a day for like a weekend in a row.

1179
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,850
Yeah.
The other day I,

1180
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:40,990
I I masturbated and then like I would
like two minutes later I was like, oh,

1181
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,080
I'm in masturbating. I'm like,
wait, I still have comm on my hands.

1182
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:48,520
Like I wasn't even like, like no time
had passed. I was only a few minutes.

1183
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,700
Yeah. People are weird. The
weirdest fuck. And Yeah,

1184
01:08:51,701 --> 01:08:54,460
when you get something like pornography
where you could just watch people

1185
01:08:54,461 --> 01:08:57,580
fucking get stimulated for short,
you can get addicted to that.

1186
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,430
But does that mean that
because you get addicted to it,

1187
01:09:00,431 --> 01:09:03,100
it shouldn't be available to people
that enjoy it? Does that mean, you know,

1188
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:08,130
does that mean that just because you think
it dehumanizes people and objectifies

1189
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:10,450
people that everyone looks at it that way?

1190
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,510
Is that it definitely is changing
that the kids nowadays, Oh yeah.

1191
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:17,780
Like these girls, like, you know,
I forget who, I think it was,

1192
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:20,300
Sarah Tiana has a bit about
it where, where, you know,

1193
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:22,070
like the girls are growing
up nowadays things,

1194
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:24,770
it's normal to get cummed on their
face. So, you know what I mean?

1195
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:27,110
Like that's what you're supposed
to do when you have sex, you know,

1196
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:30,060
or you're supposed to have a fist
in your ass once in a while and,

1197
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:33,620
and all the cause the porn so
shocking and crazy and he's like in,

1198
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:36,050
they're watching it at such
a young age that, you know,

1199
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:38,650
usually back in the day you used
to look at a playboy Django,

1200
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:39,950
the hacker has nice boobs.

1201
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,540
You're not seeing like crazy full on
triple x porn back then and people are

1202
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:47,270
seeing it on the phone and they're
in nursing. It's at a young age.

1203
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,460
Yeah. It's almost like you can't
stop it. Yeah. And you know,

1204
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:53,940
the other thing is how about grooming,
grooming,

1205
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:56,860
the grooming, the pubic hair. Oh yeah.

1206
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:01,290
Porn one that porn won that battle.
Okay. Everybody does it now.

1207
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:04,890
It's very rare that girls let their whole
box get get crazy and France is going

1208
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:07,650
extinct actually because of that.
That's, yeah. That's awesome.

1209
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:10,680
I'm going to pee now. Feel free to
talk shit about me while I'm gone.

1210
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,360
Isn't that amazing that crabs are
going extinct? Yeah, that's weird.

1211
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:19,780
They're like the indigenous people and
the rain forest that are getting wiped

1212
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:24,490
out. To think that we had something that
you know is going to be extinct one day.

1213
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:29,180
Disney should do a cartoon about like a
tribe of crabs living in the pubic hair

1214
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:32,590
or someone who's on the verge of shaving
their her pussy and they've got to like

1215
01:10:32,591 --> 01:10:36,730
convince her not to do it.
Save it,

1216
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,590
do I? I love it, man.

1217
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:43,240
I had this girl recently that had a bush
and I forgot how nice it was to have a

1218
01:10:43,241 --> 01:10:45,220
bush.
You can just a little teeny Bush.

1219
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,320
I get it.
I mean I,

1220
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,450
if a girl wants to shave her pussy
because it makes her feel better,

1221
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:54,610
I think it's good, but it's not
something I really, I liked that much.

1222
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,360
I like it when there's
some hair down there.

1223
01:10:56,361 --> 01:10:58,790
I always just feel weird when they've,

1224
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,360
they've decided to take
that leap because I mean if,

1225
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:04,460
if it makes them more comfortable,
it makes sense.

1226
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:09,020
But if they're trying to appeal to
some notion that that's what guys want,

1227
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:11,900
I think that could be a little
off base. You know? I don't,

1228
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,680
I don't know that that's exactly the,

1229
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,990
the thing that guys fantasize
about, man, just a nice shave pussy,

1230
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:22,710
right. I, I've never gotten it. I've
never, that's never been a thing that,

1231
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,890
it just made me feel like, wow, you're
really committing to, to fucking right.

1232
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:32,220
I just recently started shaving my balls
because Joe says that he shaves his

1233
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,150
balls and he'd be like,
you know what?

1234
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:37,860
I've never really just like shaved him
completely bald and so I did and it's so

1235
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:40,650
much nicer.
When do you use just a razor?

1236
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:45,240
Put some soap on it or some shaving cream
and I could Gillette sensor once I was

1237
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:48,570
trimming my pubes and I
sliced a piece of my like Oh,

1238
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,430
skin with the scissors.

1239
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:54,300
It was really sad because like I was
about to go on a date and I'm like,

1240
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:58,650
I got to trim this Bush. And I ended
up like cutting a piece of my skin off.

1241
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,290
So it's like now if we end up having sex,

1242
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:04,200
she's gonna think I have some kind of
soul. Never going to believe you either.

1243
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,550
I can't. Like I was trimming my cubes for
you. I was so excited that I cut myself.

1244
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,700
I caught my dick and a
zipper once more than once,

1245
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,460
but once in a way that
it left like a mark,

1246
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:17,720
like a little herpes mark or something.
So painful. Yeah. Well, yeah,

1247
01:12:17,721 --> 01:12:20,870
you got to wear underwear,
you know? Yeah. You got it.

1248
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:23,980
One time I caught it with underwear
and it was not that bad. I've,

1249
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,580
I've caught my dick so
many times and a zipper.

1250
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:27,280
I can't even imagine
if I had a countertop,

1251
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,570
I'd be so sad and I'll fucking stupid.
I am.

1252
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,810
It's more than a dozen over my whole life,
but one time it was bleeding.

1253
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:38,420
That's how Jay Dow Chase Algaes.
Yeah, I could button flight. Nowadays,

1254
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:42,410
I hate zippers, but I'm flies a
good move. I got a problem, man. I,

1255
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,180
I need to figure out better pants.

1256
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:48,110
I need to start wearing pants that are
too big and then like get a belt that

1257
01:12:48,111 --> 01:12:50,540
ties it down because when,
when pants fit my waist,

1258
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:54,740
they don't fit my troll like thighs.
Well you just, you know, I mean,

1259
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:55,700
do you get straight leg?

1260
01:12:55,701 --> 01:12:58,490
Do you get I get bought baggy
ones then they're not baggy.

1261
01:12:58,491 --> 01:13:01,280
They have to be like skateboarder
baggy to be baggy on me.

1262
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,050
Like regular Levi five oh ones. Good
fucking luck. Those I can't put those on.

1263
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,440
I can't even get those. I
get those halfway up. My
fine. They're stuck. I can't,

1264
01:13:09,441 --> 01:13:12,890
I can't wear them. Like that's the regular
jeans that guys are supposed to wear.

1265
01:13:12,891 --> 01:13:16,730
I can't wear those. I guess. Can't you
buy him big and just go to a tailor?

1266
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,300
I think I'm going to have
to buy him the right length,

1267
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:23,190
but a wider waste just to
see if they make the legs.

1268
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:27,530
They must make your legs bigger than they
figure you're a fat fuck. Yeah. This, uh,

1269
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,410
I got a,

1270
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,820
I got a real problem with that though
because on TV I look like I'm wearing

1271
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:34,670
girls jeans because my jeans,
like they're tight on the top.

1272
01:13:34,671 --> 01:13:36,570
Like I'm wearing skinny jeans.
You can see my pack.

1273
01:13:36,571 --> 01:13:38,630
It was just all bundled
in there and talked.

1274
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,090
There's this app called Tinder.
Have you heard of the rent?

1275
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:47,800
No. No, I haven't heard of it. It's
Tinder. Tinder is this thing where it,

1276
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:50,580
what it does,
it's based on location and it will uh,

1277
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,730
it will pull up a girl's
photo and it will say like,

1278
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:58,170
this girl is like block from
you. And he say like, uh,

1279
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:02,310
like POW or like us thumbs up or thumbs
down and you can like look through their

1280
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:05,340
photos and everything like that.
But, uh, my friend Benji Afflalo,

1281
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,780
he found this like secret.

1282
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:10,920
So what we do is we just sit there as
fast as we can and except, except, except,

1283
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:14,200
except don't even look at the foot cause
you're like going through like millions

1284
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:18,670
of them and if they like you back,
uh, it brings up a chat room.

1285
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,500
And this guy I know, he says that he's
gone for the last six months. He's uh,

1286
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,960
gone on like 30 dates and
about 90% of them he's fucked.

1287
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:31,630
Yes man. I guys, that guy's
on a rampage. Fuck me.

1288
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:34,150
And addicted to pornography.
That's what he's doing.

1289
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,260
We were talking to when you went to p
about there's a some new campaign called

1290
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:42,830
about pornography being the new
drug and uh, I don't disagree,

1291
01:14:42,831 --> 01:14:44,840
but I don't agree that you should stop it.

1292
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,510
I don't agree that you should
tell people they can't do it.

1293
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:50,630
I don't agree that you can tell
people they shouldn't watch it.

1294
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:55,340
I feel like it's like everything else,
just like booze, just like cigarettes,

1295
01:14:55,341 --> 01:14:58,700
just like coffee. You can, you can
overdose on star Trek, starcraft.

1296
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:02,570
You can overdose and everything and
you could overdose on porn or a regular

1297
01:15:02,571 --> 01:15:06,560
person. I th I believe it's
possible to watch, to jerk off,

1298
01:15:06,561 --> 01:15:08,540
watch a little bit of porn
and then go about your day.

1299
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,440
I know people that do that.
I just know age,

1300
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:15,200
these fucking fundamentalist
creeps would get there.

1301
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:20,200
God Damn Morality and ethics and
fear dynamics out of our orgasms.

1302
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,620
I don't think that this is a
fundamentalist organization. I don't,

1303
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:28,310
I sound from what I looked
maybe from what I looked though,

1304
01:15:28,311 --> 01:15:31,790
it didn't reference religion at all.
It seemed to be that was just there.

1305
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:33,350
You know, it was just a, uh, uh,

1306
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:38,650
an organization that thinks
that pornography itself
is detrimental to society

1307
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:43,640
and to relationships. And I could see
how they would say that, but I say no.

1308
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:48,260
I say though,
the behaviors of people that are addicted,

1309
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:51,770
those are the things that are detrimental
to societies and those behaviors can

1310
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:55,340
manifest themselves in porn. They can
also manifest themselves in gambling.

1311
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:58,130
They can manifest itself in a
lot of different crazy things.

1312
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:59,990
People are fucking nuts.

1313
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:04,550
And the regular day to day job of no risk,
no reward,

1314
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:09,200
that that pattern of life is not
fucking rewarding. And because of that,

1315
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,730
people have these big,

1316
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:15,810
they'd go on these nutty Chase's often
to the woods of craziness and they'll,

1317
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,310
they'll bet their entire house
on a fucking hand of cards.

1318
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:21,180
They'll still do nutty shit.
That man,

1319
01:16:21,181 --> 01:16:24,650
it's not always because of a mundane jobs,

1320
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:27,950
but there's a part of us, whatever
it is, whatever is the cause of it.

1321
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:32,510
The point is there's a part of human
beings that will just get obsessed with

1322
01:16:32,511 --> 01:16:35,990
something and get crazy with something
and just fucking along with it and then

1323
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:39,440
go, oh Jesus, what did I do? And it
could be that with pornography I'm sure.

1324
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,140
But it could be that with almost anything.

1325
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:47,180
And if you looked at the amount of
people that watch pornography and aren't

1326
01:16:47,181 --> 01:16:51,770
crazy and don't objectify women because
of it and aren't mean to people because

1327
01:16:51,771 --> 01:16:54,260
of it and don't hate and
don't want to rape and kill,

1328
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,080
I would have to assume
that that's much larger.

1329
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:02,590
And there's also studies that show that
people that are exposed to whether it's

1330
01:17:03,231 --> 01:17:06,300
extreme like rough sex or,
or,

1331
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:10,340
or different types of sex are
different, different, you know,

1332
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:15,341
different sexual acts that it can ease
their desire to perform those acts that

1333
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:20,750
it can actually like, especially
like things like, like rough sex.

1334
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,870
Like there's some people that have like
fantasies about that they can watch it

1335
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:26,730
in a porn and never want to hit somebody.
Right.

1336
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,450
And they think that it can act as,
you know,

1337
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:31,850
it can have some sort of
an alleviating effect.

1338
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:35,270
And I don't know if these
studies are biased. I don't
know if you know, they were,

1339
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:39,050
they went into it trying to
prove something and if it's
been rejected by science,

1340
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:43,520
but I know the argument is kind of strange
that it has that sort of alleviating

1341
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:47,510
effect that has that sort of a release
mechanism effect like violent movies.

1342
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:48,950
A lot of people feel the same way.

1343
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:54,190
I find it an incredibly strange that
we have no problem with violent movies.

1344
01:17:54,831 --> 01:17:58,490
There's very little blow
back to these Batman movies.

1345
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,560
Zombie movies are all
these different movies,

1346
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:05,150
but yet if there was that same type
of extreme sexuality in a film,

1347
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,790
we would lose our fucking minds.
Yeah.

1348
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:11,210
But it is an extreme
violence just as disturbing,

1349
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:13,610
if not more disturbing
than extreme sexuality.

1350
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,620
Well, isn't it funny that the two even
get put in the same goddamn category?

1351
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,530
Right.
Did there even compared like one,

1352
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:21,260
you have like just
pleasure seeking people,

1353
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:25,170
trying to reach a temporary
utopian states, uh,

1354
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,690
by coming on the other,

1355
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:30,920
you have people actively killing each
other and yet somehow people even bring

1356
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:35,180
those two together. It's like talking
about dragons versus butterflies,

1357
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:38,480
like one just supposed to be fun, you
know, and I think that's one of the,

1358
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:43,130
that that's one of the problems with this
repressed sexual culture that we live

1359
01:18:43,131 --> 01:18:47,720
in is that what ends up
happening is people watch
porn and what they're seeing a

1360
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:50,990
lot of times is the result of
sexual repression. You know,

1361
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:53,780
when you get that creepy narrator,
I'm sure we've talked about this before,

1362
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:56,870
but that guy who were like ruins the porn.
You know what I'm talking about?

1363
01:18:56,871 --> 01:19:01,700
The creepy narrator like, yes, Ooh, what
do we have here? A little dirty girl.

1364
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:03,710
You dirty, you dirty, you want to suck.

1365
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:06,660
He's known as the worst was
when the camera man does it.

1366
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,410
The girls having sex with the guy
and the camera has gone, Oh yeah,

1367
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:13,110
you want to suck his cock it all
the way down. You're like, Hey,

1368
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,660
what's going on here?
Who's that creep at the camera?

1369
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,400
You know that fucking Weirdo.

1370
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:22,510
So fucking weird man. And
it's like, Eh, the, the, the,

1371
01:19:22,511 --> 01:19:26,890
that porn down, you know that thing?
What is that? Where suddenly no, yeah,

1372
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:27,750
this is what we're doing.

1373
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,010
And sometimes it's the girl too.
Sometimes girls can be like, oh yeah,

1374
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:36,690
fucking baby. Oh yeah. And you're
like, Hey Jesus, what's going on here?

1375
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,370
That thing. So all the screaming. Yeah.
That thing, that thing is so weird.

1376
01:19:41,371 --> 01:19:45,570
And that is just a result I
think of sexual repression. Okay.

1377
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:49,800
I don't know about that. I think is to
some guys, that's what they like to hear.

1378
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:54,600
Some guys want to hear that girl being
all loud and obnoxious. Fuck my ass baby.

1379
01:19:55,620 --> 01:20:00,040
And then some guys also want to hear the
guy, you know, I think we saw the style.

1380
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:03,330
So everyone's wildly, everyone's
got their own style. The point is,

1381
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:07,980
how weird are we were extreme violence
is the expendables. It's everywhere

1382
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,110
now. They shoot someone that had
their fucking brain explodes.

1383
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:11,400
That's someone's baby.

1384
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:14,370
That guy just shot someone's
baby that grew up in the head.

1385
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:18,430
And His fucking skull exploded and we
accepted cause he's the bad guy. Right.

1386
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,180
You know,
and w w w why is that acceptable?

1387
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:25,050
Why is that not just acceptable
but barely criticized?

1388
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:30,470
Well it's because a long time ago
some really fucked up dudes started

1389
01:20:31,621 --> 01:20:36,210
controlling everything and it's been
going on and on like that for a very long

1390
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,050
time.
And we're the,

1391
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:42,320
we're the descendants of super sexually
repressed fundamentalist religious

1392
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:47,781
fanatics who came over here to start
Utopian societies and is part of their

1393
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:49,260
understanding of things.

1394
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,040
Decided that they were going to
lock that pussy underneath a Bible.

1395
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:56,820
And that's what where we're at today.
She's true, isn't it? That is what it is,

1396
01:20:56,821 --> 01:20:59,340
isn't it? Yes. It's just a, it's just a,

1397
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:03,990
a really beautiful Massey act
that's kind of embarrassing,

1398
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:08,991
but it's just ultimately fun and we've
managed to turn it into a Goddamn

1399
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,250
multiside h p Lovecraft monster that
you're not supposed to talk about.

1400
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:18,720
Certainly never show it to your kids.
Never want your kids to see sex ever.

1401
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:23,160
That's the worst thing. It's like
the most we, it's just fucked up.

1402
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:27,420
It's like Nancy Grace Shit man. It's
taking off. Did you hear about that? Yeah.

1403
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:31,110
Some guy was trying to kill Nancy grace.
Yeah, with once at knives and stuff.

1404
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:34,440
What was he on his way to her house or
something? I don't know. You Know Jamie?

1405
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:39,050
Yeah. Jamie. Well Poor Nancy
grace. Are you all doing,

1406
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:42,720
are you allowed in bed? Am I loud in
bed? Yeah. Do you make noises there?

1407
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,960
You the fuck are you, I don't want
to know. It takes a little secret.

1408
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:50,010
I very, uh, very wildly
like in all things.

1409
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:51,980
I do like to talk so that I can hear you.

1410
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,980
It depends on what kind of
sex is happening. What kind
of ball gag he's gotten.

1411
01:21:55,981 --> 01:21:59,380
His mouth.
It depends on outside.

1412
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:06,150
Did you guys see that? And Yoko Ono
thing speaking a ball gag. I've seen that

1413
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:10,340
new thing that she did. The, the, the
sing, the cover of the Adele Song.

1414
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,320
I saw that. That's kind
of old. I've seen that.

1415
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,740
How old is it? A Dell has only been
around for a couple of years. I mean,

1416
01:22:14,741 --> 01:22:18,350
I saw it like a year ago. 2012.
Yeah. Pull it. Pull it up.

1417
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:22,840
Because this bears repeating for the
fix for folks who haven't seen this in a

1418
01:22:22,841 --> 01:22:27,000
home that's a kitty. She
does this thing. I Dunno.

1419
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:30,200
I mean it's almost like now
she's like heard the criticism.

1420
01:22:30,201 --> 01:22:33,190
So she's just taken it to the
next level and making it a joke.

1421
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:36,320
And so Yoko Ono is at
this art gallery and uh,

1422
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:39,970
she pulls up this microphone.
It's really,

1423
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,440
she's like really strange.
Someone like you as the song and uh,

1424
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:49,480
she's dressed like real weird and
people still sort of give her attention

1425
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:53,140
because she was John Lennon's wife
and John Lennon was, you know,

1426
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:56,500
a motherfucker in his time.
So she gets up to this microphone.

1427
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:06,110
So weird.

1428
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,533
No,

1429
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,700
and I'm sure most of the
people in the crowd were like,

1430
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:22,440
what the fuck John Lennon,
what did you do to us?

1431
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,553
Isn't it

1432
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,680
kind of making fun of a doubt?
I don't know. I think she be,

1433
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:31,000
cause that's kind of like,

1434
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:34,270
maybe that's her interpretation
of modern music or something.

1435
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:38,620
Like she's like making fun of what
she considers to be the empty,

1436
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:40,630
uh,
emptiness.

1437
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,390
Sir. The book. And you're
looking into it too far, pal.

1438
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:49,990
This is why I say not because she
never did anything good before that.

1439
01:23:50,211 --> 01:23:53,630
It's not like she did something that
was like really cool and interesting and

1440
01:23:53,631 --> 01:23:58,220
then people really got into it and
then she's doing this as a parody. No,

1441
01:23:58,221 --> 01:24:00,340
this is what she's always done that,
that thing

1442
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:01,890
there,
that law.

1443
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:06,670
She's always done that like bill burr
had this whole Clarius bit about Chuck

1444
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:09,160
Berry and John Lennon
doing a solo together.

1445
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:13,450
They're a duo rather and there they're
singing this song and you know John

1446
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:16,390
Lennon's they're singing and
Yoko ono is like playing the,

1447
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,340
the fucking tambourine,

1448
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:20,840
the background and she just
pulls up a microphone and goals.

1449
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:21,813
Nah,

1450
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,350
like she,
she makes this crazy noise and like,

1451
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,080
and you could see the look on
Chuck Berry's face. Like they've,

1452
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,540
whoever made the video of the
bill birthing did an awesome job.

1453
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:35,250
He is it mischief maker? Did he make it?
No. Some other dude, whoever made it,

1454
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:39,120
they froze frame. Right. When Chuck Berry
had this crazy looking as I was like,

1455
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:39,230
yeah,

1456
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:43,580
what the fuck the bitches do, man. I've
noticed that there's people like that.

1457
01:24:43,581 --> 01:24:46,370
He will attach themselves
to things and ruin it.

1458
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:49,750
Like there's always a lot of times
you'll find yourself around someone who's

1459
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,560
just going to squawk out some
bullshit and ruin everything. Yeah,

1460
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:55,160
I would love to see that Brian.

1461
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:58,050
Yeah, it's yet to see the
bill version of it. Okay.

1462
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:03,150
No, but anyway, she's up to
playing the bongos. Right.

1463
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:04,830
So John Lennon,
Chuck Berry,

1464
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:09,590
two of the greatest of all time
harmonizing singing this hit from the 1950

1465
01:25:09,591 --> 01:25:11,340
[inaudible].
That's what this moment is about.

1466
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:14,670
And Yoko in the middle of it can't
handle that. She's not getting any shine.

1467
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,070
She takes the fucking
microphone out of the stands,

1468
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:20,040
starts playing the Bongo and as
they're singing, you know, go,

1469
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:23,630
go Johnny go whatever. She picks up
the mic and I swear to God goes, yeah,

1470
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,490
some fucking crazy shit.

1471
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:33,930
Fucking open as wide as
they are in that fucking,

1472
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:40,980
what did he do?
What is it

1473
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:46,120
bout the some dudes like a John Lennon
type guide that seems by all accounts to

1474
01:25:46,911 --> 01:25:50,420
be like one of the coolest people that's
ever lived. This brilliant artist,

1475
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:53,630
these amazing songs,
this great way of looking at life.

1476
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:56,000
And then he has this really weird way

1477
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:00,360
Asian fetish man back then it wasn't
that common to have an Asian girlfriend.

1478
01:26:00,361 --> 01:26:01,190
Right.

1479
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:06,050
I think it was also who she was.
I think some women will provide,

1480
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:10,490
they will provide like a guidance thing
to some guys like Ozzy Osborne's wife,

1481
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:13,910
obviously a very strong woman,
very opinionated,

1482
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:18,050
successful business woman and she takes
care of one of the craziest guys in rock

1483
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:18,680
and roll.

1484
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,740
That's why that show was so interesting
because you've got this guy that's like

1485
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,350
eating pigeons heads on stage.
He's a fucking animal.

1486
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:29,000
He's done every drug known to man. He
goes on stage and kids go fucking crazy.

1487
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:30,710
It's fucking awesome.

1488
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:35,300
He represents the ANC asked
of every fucked up kid.

1489
01:26:35,301 --> 01:26:38,090
He's God Damn Ozzy Osborne,
you know,

1490
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:40,430
and he's singing crazy train
and everybody's going nuts.

1491
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:45,110
And then he's got this wife who's
like on the ball taking care of shit,

1492
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,730
putting things in line,
managing his career, make
sure he gets paid. Let's with,

1493
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,750
we're going to do a reality
show, honey, you know,

1494
01:26:50,751 --> 01:26:53,760
and all of a sudden a whole reality
check and he's running around.

1495
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:55,580
He's barely talk,

1496
01:26:55,581 --> 01:26:58,910
he's going to fucking reality show his
wife and his kids are getting all the

1497
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,870
attention because I mean, well not all
the attention, but I mean he's, he's,

1498
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:06,210
it's almost impossible to understand them,
but they find this and hit,

1499
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,330
in his case, it was a positive, you know,

1500
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:12,110
he found this woman who was like really
on the ball, but in John Lennon's case,

1501
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:15,080
not, he just found this woman who
just said, come here, hold my hand,

1502
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,650
I'll take this, I got this. And
she just, I've seen it happen.

1503
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,040
I've seen it happen with comics.
Have you ever met a comic and a,

1504
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:24,020
they have a girlfriend that
sort of running the show?

1505
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:29,000
Kristina Brzezinski Thompson girls,
Polaris. That's, that's a bad one.

1506
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:33,660
But I had a friend back in the
day, he, sadly, he's passed. Um,

1507
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:36,650
but he had a girlfriend and
his girlfriend was, you know,

1508
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:40,780
sort of like his manager type situation.
Just running the show. Like, you know,

1509
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,520
deciding what he does, what he
doesn't do and they get, you know,

1510
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,920
they get linked up together and it gets,
it gets weird.

1511
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:49,250
It's like they become a package deal.
Like every time you're around Mike,

1512
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:52,130
you're also around sending
like, oh Jesus, here we go.

1513
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:56,120
Or they'll start sharing emails.
Yes. Oh, that's a big one.

1514
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:59,630
That's a big one. Where they have
the same email account. Yeah.

1515
01:27:59,631 --> 01:28:02,110
He may even the wife have the same
meal. Okay. Dude, I'm not trying,

1516
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,510
I don't know your wife. We're not friends.
Okay. I'm trying to send you an email.

1517
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:09,320
Do you have your own email so we can
talk shit and I can maybe send you a porn

1518
01:28:09,321 --> 01:28:13,340
link and not, and not have to
deal with your wife going, hey,

1519
01:28:13,341 --> 01:28:16,670
that's a shared email account and an
appreciate you sending him all your

1520
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:21,140
bullshit. Every time you call they're on
fucking speaker. Oh, that's bad. Yeah,

1521
01:28:21,141 --> 01:28:21,974
that's bad.

1522
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:26,510
Or how about when the woman answers the
phone and it's his cell phone? Yeah.

1523
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,960
You know, you're like, hello. I thought
I was calling Mike. Oh, who is this?

1524
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:34,130
Is Mike there? Yeah. Who is this
please? Like, oh Jesus. Like you know,

1525
01:28:34,131 --> 01:28:38,750
not even famous people. Uh, this is Cho.
Can I talk to, and then you like, dude,

1526
01:28:38,751 --> 01:28:42,290
why is your girlfriend answer your
phone? Oh Hey, I don't care. You know,

1527
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,101
it's no big deal.

1528
01:28:43,101 --> 01:28:46,550
It's just laying around like that person
is like controlling your environment.

1529
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:50,210
So weird. Isn't it so
weird? So it's weird.

1530
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,840
It's just as weird if a guy does it.
If the girl's phone's ringing the cruiser.

1531
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,460
Hello, Debbie. Oh yeah,

1532
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:02,040
I'll get her old army.
I ate Joe. I hate that.

1533
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,790
Sloan you to talk to Debbie.
So creepy man.

1534
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:09,690
When people try to control each other
like that, it's so spooky, isn't it?

1535
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:14,400
It is spooky. It's dangerous
too. It's tricky. It's dangerous.

1536
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,430
You got to just know when someone really
likes you and if they don't like you

1537
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:19,830
either find someone that does or
figuring out what's wrong with yourself.

1538
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:22,340
If you don't,
you're going to get in that cycle of,

1539
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:25,530
I'd like that girl that I dated that
went through my phone and it took

1540
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:28,290
screenshots of every
single text I did the hook,

1541
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,080
every photo that I had in there
and send it to herself. Like,

1542
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:34,470
like pretty much spent four hours
while I was sleeping in bed,

1543
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,720
just going through my phone and
making copies of everything.

1544
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:40,110
Well that's obviously a person that
thought you were doing something different

1545
01:29:40,111 --> 01:29:43,830
than what you were doing. She just
decided that she had the right to do that.

1546
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:47,520
You know, have the right to do
that to people. Don't, you know,

1547
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:50,270
and that's one of the weirdest
things about, to become the NSA.

1548
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,830
You don't have the right to go
through someone's phone. I mean,

1549
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:56,580
if someone's lying to you, yeah, that
sucks. It sucks that someone lied to you,

1550
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:59,910
but you know what sucks just as bad.
Are you going through their fucking phone?

1551
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:04,200
That's, that's uh, I mean,
finding out that someone
betrayed you by betraying them,

1552
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,720
nobody wins there. You
know, that's not a win.

1553
01:30:06,721 --> 01:30:10,440
And it's certainly not a win
if you're using it to, to fuck.

1554
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:14,340
It's like people need to figure
out a way to just get along better.

1555
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:17,580
I don't know what it is.
I don't know how,

1556
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:22,430
how you eliminate the 50% plus divorce
rate that we have in this country.

1557
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:27,150
I don't know how you get it so that
people can figure out how to not be that

1558
01:30:27,151 --> 01:30:32,010
person, not be the woman, not be the man.
Not me the problem, but fuck. It's so,

1559
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:36,450
it's so hard to do. Yeah, you got to let
go, man. You just got to let go. I mean,

1560
01:30:36,451 --> 01:30:39,270
you got to let go. It's, if
somebody is going to leave you,

1561
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,970
they're going to leave you.
Well,

1562
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,040
it's not just that it's you gotta
let go while you're with them too.

1563
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:46,230
That's what I mean.
I'm saying like going through,

1564
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:49,230
by the time it gets to the point where
you're going through somebody emails to

1565
01:30:49,231 --> 01:30:53,220
see if they're cheating on you, that
fucking, that ship has left the port.

1566
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,710
It's over.
Whether they're cheating on you or not.

1567
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,920
You guys are so unconnected that
you don't know what they're doing.

1568
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:01,840
Well,

1569
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,860
you never know what someone's doing and
now you don't trust what they're doing.

1570
01:31:04,861 --> 01:31:06,360
Right.
You're still on connected.

1571
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:11,420
Did you hear about that
guy that disappeared for 22
years or I think it was 19

1572
01:31:12,061 --> 01:31:15,750
years, something like that. Long ass
time. His family assumed he was dead.

1573
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,690
They had five children.
They got a life insurance policy,

1574
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:23,580
$800,000 and it turns out he was living
with his gay lover in Palm Springs.

1575
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,350
Wow. Talking to you tweeting right now.
You're not really hearing I'm sculpting.

1576
01:31:28,351 --> 01:31:33,090
Joe. When he squeezed, it's called thing.
Played Out. What's wrong with this guy?

1577
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:38,070
Like he was a deeply religious guy and
just couldn't deal with his sexuality.

1578
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:42,090
It was just too crazy for him. He
couldn't handle it and then he went crazy.

1579
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:44,340
He went on a vacation
and just never came home.

1580
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,270
He just moved in with this gay guy and
just starts sucking cock and taking the

1581
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:51,660
but and then just loved it.
Just like this is the place for me.

1582
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:54,990
So much so that he abandoned his
children and now his children,

1583
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,210
like they were eight at the time.
Now they're grown.

1584
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:00,820
Like one of them was a grown woman and
she has children of her own and she's

1585
01:32:00,821 --> 01:32:03,340
like,
I would never do that to my kids.

1586
01:32:03,341 --> 01:32:05,410
Like he doesn't understand
like he left when I was eight.

1587
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,370
That was devastating to lose your father
when you're eight just because you know

1588
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:10,600
you can't come out of the closet.

1589
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:14,890
So you go and you never come
back for like x amount of years,

1590
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,510
1516 whatever the fuck years it was. And
then finally do come back and like, look,

1591
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:22,780
I fucked up. Like wow,
people can do that too.

1592
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:26,800
But that's one of those things you've
got to realize like we're crazy. We can,

1593
01:32:26,801 --> 01:32:30,850
that's, that's also in the wheel
house of human behavior. It is.

1594
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,780
Ukie I mean that's the trick I think of
relationships. It's just you gotta be in,

1595
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:36,460
you have all kinds of things.

1596
01:32:36,461 --> 01:32:38,260
You've got to be in the
moment with the relationships.

1597
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:42,670
If you start holding onto the idea
that that shit's going to last forever,

1598
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:45,640
you're, you'll start
going crazy. That, that,

1599
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:49,600
that's never the case.
It's just never the case.

1600
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:54,010
You have to appreciate the moments
that are good and then the moments that

1601
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:57,400
aren't so good, you've got to trust that
things are going to get better. Yeah.

1602
01:32:57,401 --> 01:32:58,780
And you've got to have a support system.

1603
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:02,200
You got to have some exercise in your
life to blow out the fucking bad hormones

1604
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:05,110
can have a lot of shit going on.
And we're not told this.

1605
01:33:05,111 --> 01:33:08,820
You got to figure it out over stumbling
through your life, running in the wall.

1606
01:33:08,821 --> 01:33:11,860
This is the question I have for you.
It's something I've been thinking about.

1607
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:16,270
Men in a relationship is a
great way to bring it up. Okay.

1608
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:22,190
If you don't feel loving towards someone,

1609
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,170
if you don't feel it,

1610
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:27,440
and that quite often happens
in relationships where
you just not feeling it

1611
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,970
right. How were you supposed to
act? In other words, you can't,

1612
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,480
if you're not feeling it and you
start acting like you're feeling it,

1613
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:38,870
aren't you being dishonest or
phony? Hmm. Well, you have to.

1614
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,700
That's a really,

1615
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,890
that's a giant general question and that's
the problem because it really depends

1616
01:33:45,891 --> 01:33:47,420
entirely on the moment.

1617
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:50,960
It depends entirely on you that person.

1618
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:55,280
The variables are so vast.
The variables of of people,

1619
01:33:55,281 --> 01:33:59,240
the variables of scenarios, the variables
of lifestyle, the variables of culture,

1620
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,300
the veil variables of what part
of the world you're living in.

1621
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:05,630
There's a lot of variables when you're
going to answer that question and it's

1622
01:34:05,631 --> 01:34:08,560
like, why do you know you're not loving
what that person who have fucked,

1623
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:13,130
I don't know your situation and to find
out your situation would take a long

1624
01:34:13,131 --> 01:34:13,461
time.

1625
01:34:13,461 --> 01:34:17,390
I would have to have a definitely deeply
delve into each one of your individual

1626
01:34:17,391 --> 01:34:20,630
lives and they wake up in the morning,
you're a little hung over.

1627
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:25,160
I'm not even talking about relationships.
You go to work, you feel like shit.

1628
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:28,670
You don't feel kind, empathetic,
compassionate at all.

1629
01:34:28,671 --> 01:34:30,320
You don't want to listen to anybody.
Yap.

1630
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:32,200
Okay.

1631
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,740
Are you faking it? If you start
acting kind to the people around you,

1632
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:40,330
what's better to follow that feeling and
just be kind of like closed off or to

1633
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:44,560
try to act as though you're happy.
Are you care about the people around you?

1634
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:48,070
Well that's a different
scenario and that scenario,

1635
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:52,030
I feel like you have an obligation to be
kind to the people that are around you

1636
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:56,320
as much as is humanly possible
without compromising your own sanity,

1637
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:57,501
without,
you know,

1638
01:34:57,501 --> 01:35:00,590
getting to the point where someone's
taking advantage of you being kind and

1639
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:04,310
they're just ruining your life and acting
like a shithead all time and you're

1640
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:08,270
like, hey dickhead, how about
pay attention to yourself?
How about you not do that?

1641
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:11,420
How about you not spew out every stupid
thought that comes out of your fucking

1642
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:14,510
mouth that ruins everybody
else's conversation because
you're doing something

1643
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:16,730
really selfish, right?
Sometimes you have to do that.

1644
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:19,670
Sometimes you have to regulate.
But other than that,

1645
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:23,120
like if you go into work hung over,
that's on you bitch. All right.

1646
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:26,240
Be Nice to everybody and
you as a human being,

1647
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:28,850
you should do it because you
want to do it. And if you think,

1648
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:32,510
I don't want to do it, you're in
the wrong frame of mind, period.

1649
01:35:32,511 --> 01:35:35,360
And that's not a generalization.
And that type of a scenario,

1650
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:38,330
what I thought you were talking about was
inside the confines of a relationship.

1651
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:41,300
And if you don't feel loving to someone
inside the confines of a relationship,

1652
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:44,480
well you know,
there's so many possible variables,

1653
01:35:44,481 --> 01:35:49,370
but I ultimately think if you're, if
you're a balanced person, if you're,

1654
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:52,400
if you are at least in
the mode of balance,

1655
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:55,700
like trying to attempt to achieve balance,
you should go with your instincts.

1656
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:58,670
And if this is not the person for you,
this is not the person for you. Right.

1657
01:35:58,690 --> 01:35:59,100
You know?

1658
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,860
Yeah, no, I'm in, I just was using
that cause we were talking about it.

1659
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:03,180
I just mean in general,

1660
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,700
you know, there's the
prescription, uh, you know,

1661
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:10,720
you'll just be nice even if you
don't feel it. Yeah, you can be nice.

1662
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:13,570
You can be nice. You mean you get
sometimes get upset, you know,

1663
01:36:13,571 --> 01:36:16,390
sometimes you know, just like, oh
look, I'm sorry man, I just fucking,

1664
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:20,350
today's crazy with me. But you know,
unless they're doing something to you,

1665
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:22,960
be nice. It's not their fault
that you're hung over some,

1666
01:36:22,961 --> 01:36:25,180
their fault that you're troubled.
It's not their fault, you know,

1667
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:28,090
as long as they're not like
interfering with your ex,

1668
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:32,260
as long as they're not being rude or
disrespectful to your own space. You know,

1669
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:35,500
we have all been there before. Like if
you come to me and you're like, dude,

1670
01:36:35,501 --> 01:36:37,090
I'm sorry I'm just in a shitty mood,
but hey,

1671
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:39,850
no worry about a man who loves
to talk. Just chill, relax.

1672
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:44,770
Like that's one thing about guys to like
say if you and I were in a car. Okay.

1673
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,590
And you like to a man, I just don't,
I really, I don't want to talk.

1674
01:36:47,591 --> 01:36:50,680
I just want to sit. I'll be like,
I get it. No worries. Just chill.

1675
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:52,590
Like you can do that. But yeah. Well if,

1676
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:55,480
if a guy and a girl are together
and the guy's like, look,

1677
01:36:55,481 --> 01:36:59,200
I just don't want to fucking talk. I just
like, you know, within 10 minutes like,

1678
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:02,890
okay, what's wrong? You can tell
me what's wrong. What is it?

1679
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,400
It's such a problem,
man.

1680
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:09,490
It's such a problem cause cause
like I like to be quiet sometimes.

1681
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:14,120
Like I like to just have moments of
quiet and stuff and it really is tough

1682
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:18,410
because sometimes it feels like girls
translate that quiet into exactly what

1683
01:37:18,411 --> 01:37:20,630
you're saying.
And it's a real problem.

1684
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:24,600
Well men and women are so
fucking radically different
as human beings with the

1685
01:37:24,601 --> 01:37:27,450
hormone levels, the, the,
the life experiences,

1686
01:37:27,451 --> 01:37:30,630
the goals and dreams and the
fact that men want to fuck women.

1687
01:37:30,631 --> 01:37:33,120
And the fact that women are
willing to let men fuck them.

1688
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:36,090
It's like all of it is so bizarre.

1689
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:41,940
There were so radically divided in like
who we are and then yet we love each

1690
01:37:41,941 --> 01:37:44,970
other and yet we're constantly around
each other. And if you're in a,

1691
01:37:44,971 --> 01:37:49,230
a relationship that you know is that
you really enjoy and is really serious,

1692
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:54,090
you're around them all the time.
Like most of the day on a regular basis.

1693
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:56,250
You know?
And it's strange.

1694
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:00,480
It's a Greg Fitzsimmons is a fucking
great bit about it where he talks about

1695
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:04,230
like if I had to choose to be with one
person on an island for the rest of my

1696
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:08,130
life, he goes, if it was you or
my wife, I'd be like, sorry honey,

1697
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:11,190
I'm going to live with Joe on an island.
It's like he goes,

1698
01:38:11,191 --> 01:38:14,340
cause we're going to have fun. He goes,
when was the last time you went to,

1699
01:38:14,341 --> 01:38:16,950
I'm going to have a great
conversation with my wife. He's like,

1700
01:38:16,951 --> 01:38:21,720
that doesn't fucking happen. He's
like, he goes, yeah, I love her. Yeah,

1701
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:25,110
we have children together, but I'm
hanging out with my friend. He goes, yeah,

1702
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:28,610
we're not going to get any
sex but so what? We'll just
go jerk off in the bushes.

1703
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:31,070
Then we'll make each other laugh
or the rest of the day and,

1704
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:36,240
and you know that's because we are,
we're we're men and we understand men.

1705
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,630
And that's why when women get together
and they tell jokes about purses and

1706
01:38:39,631 --> 01:38:44,160
shoes and what a fucking 50 shades of
grey or whatever the fuck they're into,

1707
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:47,970
whatever their, their, their
style of person is into, you know,

1708
01:38:47,971 --> 01:38:50,850
whether it's whatever,
feminist jokes, whatever,

1709
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,520
they get together and they laugh at
the shit that they think is funny.

1710
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,220
And if you were there, you'd
be like, Oh fucking Christ.

1711
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:59,160
But for them it's so awesome.
They're laughing,

1712
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,750
they're lol in and they're saying stupid
shit to each other that they like to

1713
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:07,140
hear. Why? Because they don't have
estrogen or they don't have testosterone.

1714
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:09,870
Rather they have estrogen, they have
ovaries, they don't have a penis,

1715
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:13,200
they have a vagina, they have totally
different setup. It's a different animal.

1716
01:39:13,201 --> 01:39:14,370
It's a totally different thing.

1717
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:19,170
So for you to try to become what
she wants you to be, that's madness.

1718
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:22,950
And for you to want her to become
what you want her to be like,

1719
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,300
that's madness too.

1720
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,340
Like you got to figure out what each
other is and just sort of accept it.

1721
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:31,750
And as soon as you don't do that,
you're fucked. You're fucked. It's,

1722
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:34,110
you're just going to fucking hit
the rocks. It's not gonna last.

1723
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:35,100
It's gonna fall apart.

1724
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:39,060
You're closing your eyes and hitting the
gas and one day eventually going to hit

1725
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:42,060
something. It's not gonna work.
All right. Yeah, it's true.

1726
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:45,150
So when someone's going through your
fucking emails and checking your text

1727
01:39:45,151 --> 01:39:48,450
messages and sending all that
shit to themselves, that's not,

1728
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,330
it's never going to work. It's never
going to work for all the raw what?

1729
01:39:51,331 --> 01:39:52,820
You don't know, he's crazy, right?

1730
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:56,170
You don't know Brian red bands a freak
and you're not paying attention, right.

1731
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:59,370
How are you not paying attention? Did
you not know this guy? I know this guy.

1732
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:03,770
You know I don't have to
look at his phone. I know
him. You know, it's like you,

1733
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,700
we were so radically different though
that that is a lesson that's so easily

1734
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:11,610
said and so impossible to absorb.

1735
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:15,510
And then it doesn't help that if
you tune into the view, you know,

1736
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:18,570
and they're all going, oh no girl,
he needs to give you his phone.

1737
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,860
You need to take that phone.

1738
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:22,800
You need to be able to look at that
phone anytime of day, whatever you want,

1739
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:26,070
you need to be able to do that.
Pornography is just as bad as cheating.

1740
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:29,700
I've heard that. I've heard that there
was an argument that was on the, uh,

1741
01:40:29,701 --> 01:40:33,690
the fight porn website though a woman
was saying that porn was watching.

1742
01:40:33,691 --> 01:40:37,050
Porn is just as bad as cheating,
but just crazy talk, you know,

1743
01:40:37,051 --> 01:40:40,560
it's there. We just, we're just weird.

1744
01:40:40,561 --> 01:40:44,780
It's totally different at Muskrat's
in Unicode, he's dating a girl once,

1745
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:49,790
a long time ago and I made the mistake
of leaving porn up on the computer and

1746
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:54,160
leaving and like, she came in
and saw whatever porn website add

1747
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,070
up in my apartment. I don't remember
why she's going into my apartment,

1748
01:40:57,071 --> 01:41:01,120
but I remember coming home, I guess I
told her to meet me there or something.

1749
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,010
I don't have American coming home.

1750
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:06,760
She's sitting on my bed and she's in
tears and she's like, is this who you are?

1751
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:12,140
This is what you like.
You like jerking off to this shit.

1752
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:17,410
I'm not good enough for you. It was
shocking because I, at that time I didn't

1753
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,380
realize it. That was some women, wait,

1754
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:24,640
I associated my four minutes or five
minutes of lubing up my hand and jerking

1755
01:41:26,471 --> 01:41:30,490
off to some random gay porn
clip is like something, um,

1756
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:34,990
something offensive. Yeah. I didn't
cause it's such a small little,

1757
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:38,120
it's such a small little thing.
That's what you failed to mention though.

1758
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:41,600
It was gay porn. That's why
she was pissed off. Wow. Wow.

1759
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,710
Yeah. I would, I date with a
girl whose mom is I older than,

1760
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:52,190
or younger than me. Oh, Christ.
He's there any booze in here, man.

1761
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:56,530
Can we get a drink? Yeah, I have
ice. Uh, no. Yeah. Was it was nine,

1762
01:41:56,531 --> 01:42:01,070
925. It's not going to start
until 10 o'clock. Um, we're
at the Ice House tonight,

1763
01:42:01,071 --> 01:42:02,100
folks.
If you have an a,

1764
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:04,640
if you're in the neighborhood and you
haven't made plans for the evening,

1765
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,900
hey dude, did you happen
to get ice? Did you show,

1766
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:10,460
did you see that fucking Pacific rim?

1767
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:14,390
Uh, no, I didn't. Did
you? Yeah, you did see it.

1768
01:42:14,391 --> 01:42:15,830
We were talking about it the other day.

1769
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:20,100
Oh, ugh. Ugh, oh my fucking God, man.

1770
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:24,780
So really add, it's visually really
cool, but the characters are,

1771
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:29,070
I tweeted that in like it and caught a
lot of flack from really people who like

1772
01:42:29,071 --> 01:42:32,700
robots and Godzillas and
they're like Gluco. Have you
ever seen a Godzilla movie?

1773
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:37,630
You expect that to have good
characters and it's like, come on you.

1774
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:41,160
Just because it's got fantasy beings
in it doesn't mean it can't be good.

1775
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:45,520
Right? There's a lot of fantasy beings
movies that are awesome. You know,

1776
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:47,600
even simple ones like you
didn't like Avatar though.

1777
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:53,680
Avatar I liked better than I liked.
I see. I made it through Avatar.

1778
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:57,880
I didn't make it through Pacific rim.
I laughed really 40 minutes in.

1779
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,240
Oh my God, I can't believe that
bored out of my fucking mind.

1780
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,430
That's amazing. And this is a Benicio
del Toro or a not be so the Torah,

1781
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:10,860
one of those things where he presents
it. I don't know if he did, if it was,

1782
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:11,970
I'm not positive about that,

1783
01:43:11,971 --> 01:43:15,990
but he did the same thing with Mama where
it's like Guillermo del Toro presents.

1784
01:43:15,991 --> 01:43:20,350
Mama do you just like, it's attaches
a name to it. I mean, I would,

1785
01:43:20,351 --> 01:43:22,230
I would not go see Pacific rim.

1786
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:26,820
I would go see that movie that's coming
out this Friday about the, the new, um,

1787
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,160
what's his name? The guy or did grizzly
man. Oh yeah, yeah. Werner Herzog. Yeah.

1788
01:43:32,161 --> 01:43:34,530
He's putting out a movie
called the act of killing.

1789
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:35,640
Yeah.

1790
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:38,450
Oh, I heard about. Very
disturbing. I heard it's,

1791
01:43:38,451 --> 01:43:43,320
it's a disturbing and I heard
it's brilliant. Yeah. His
stuff is always brilliant.

1792
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:46,880
So one thing that I didn't connect
with with him is that cave, uh, the,

1793
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,390
the movie about the Cave Art.

1794
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:49,270
Yeah.

1795
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:51,590
Oh yeah.
Cave of forgotten dreams.

1796
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,330
It didn't, for whatever reason, I didn't
really, I dunno. I didn't enjoy that.

1797
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:59,630
That's a snoozer dude. That one. Yeah.
Knocks your ass out. Yeah. I don't know.

1798
01:43:59,631 --> 01:44:02,210
I don't know why everybody liked that
one. I was watching that one. I was like,

1799
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:06,410
hmm. I don't, there's nothing there for
me. But um, I love the happy people.

1800
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,440
I told you about that one life on the
taiga about all these people that live in

1801
01:44:09,441 --> 01:44:11,750
Siberia and their trappers and,
and fishermen.

1802
01:44:11,751 --> 01:44:13,130
And hunters and they're just so happy.

1803
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:15,700
They're all like dancing and
hugging each other and you know,

1804
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:19,250
they're living off the land and,
and teaching each other how to, uh,

1805
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:23,420
how to survive this. It's really
a, it's an amazing movie. Yeah.

1806
01:44:23,421 --> 01:44:25,640
He's a genius man. Yeah.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1807
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:30,590
And also I heard black fish is really good
too. What's blackfish? Black fishes a,

1808
01:44:30,591 --> 01:44:31,550
I think it's called black fish.

1809
01:44:31,551 --> 01:44:36,551
It's about seaworld and it's about the
way they kidnap orcas and bring them in

1810
01:44:36,561 --> 01:44:37,800
and how the work is like,

1811
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:38,791
you know,

1812
01:44:38,791 --> 01:44:42,510
every once in a while the oracle will
like grab one by the arm or kill one of

1813
01:44:42,511 --> 01:44:46,650
them got killed. An orca killed one
of them, but you know, it's the,

1814
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:50,940
these are super intelligent beings
that you're keeping in a swimming pool,

1815
01:44:50,941 --> 01:44:54,300
swimming pool basically.
And it's just torture and a hellish exists

1816
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:57,750
stents for them and, yeah. And they're
like, what? Oh, I can't understand you.

1817
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:00,900
I guess you're going to have to keep
doing tricks if you want fish. Yeah.

1818
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:03,300
Do you want this fish? Okay.
You know what I want from you?

1819
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:07,320
I want you to flip out of here.
I don't know what you're saying.

1820
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:10,290
Do you want the fish? You
have to flip? Uh, yeah.

1821
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,880
I know they sound of the dolphins can,

1822
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,190
will they believe rather
than the dolphins have names,

1823
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:18,970
names for each other? Yes.
Yeah. It's so cool and I'm
sure orcas do too. I bet. Yeah.

1824
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:23,070
There they killed off ones though.
They call them non human people in India.

1825
01:45:23,071 --> 01:45:25,710
That's what they've started
calling them as non human people.

1826
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:29,620
Yeah, they're, it's, it's really
obvious. They're smartest shit.

1827
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,530
There's no way that they should
be in swimming pools. That's it.

1828
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:36,280
So horrific. Did you see that
woman in front of the Dolphin?

1829
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:40,720
A aquarium doing back flips for them and
they stopped to watch her and it's like

1830
01:45:40,721 --> 01:45:42,100
they're really into watching it.

1831
01:45:42,101 --> 01:45:44,620
They bought two of them are his
sort of sitting there watching.

1832
01:45:44,830 --> 01:45:46,600
One of them seems to be like grinning.

1833
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:50,200
It seems like they're really smiling
like they think it's funny or weird.

1834
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:54,130
Have you seen when they look
in the mirror, have you seen
those videos? Yeah. Yeah.

1835
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:58,780
That's amazing. They like pose and like
they like they really are into them.

1836
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:01,790
They're very aware of what they are.
Yeah,

1837
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,890
and I think it's cool to
them to see themselves.

1838
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,020
Like they don't get to see
that on the ocean ever.

1839
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,700
So all of a sudden they have a mirror.

1840
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:12,830
It's gotta be a weird thing to have
that sort of branch of development where

1841
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:15,380
they are.
Cerebral cortex is very evolved.

1842
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:20,150
They have this very complex language
dialects and so complex and so different

1843
01:46:20,151 --> 01:46:21,800
from ours that we don't understand it.

1844
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:25,790
We are trying to pick out
patterns and bits and pieces,

1845
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:30,290
but as far as anyone been
able to translate dolphin
until like a code that you

1846
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:33,680
could read as English text, no one's
been able to do that. They can't do it,

1847
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:36,830
but yet they understand what
you're saying when you say, hey,

1848
01:46:36,831 --> 01:46:39,530
you want a piece of fish, you want
to be some fish, do your flip.

1849
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,650
And they'll do the flip. Like they know
what you're saying. They, they, they,

1850
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,750
they can understand what you're saying
but we don't understand what they're

1851
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:47,020
saying.
It's really kind of interesting.

1852
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,220
It's fascinating, man. I think
a lot of what they're doing,

1853
01:46:50,221 --> 01:46:52,770
I saw some documentary on them.
I wish I remember what it was,

1854
01:46:52,771 --> 01:46:55,680
but it's how their languages,
a lot of it's movement too.

1855
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:57,660
It's not just the sounds they're making,

1856
01:46:57,661 --> 01:47:00,660
but on top of it as the movements
that they're making with the sound.

1857
01:47:00,661 --> 01:47:03,690
And it's also a relational to the,
to,

1858
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:07,050
it's like a more of a dance that
they're doing with, what do you call it,

1859
01:47:07,051 --> 01:47:11,910
a pack of dolphins. What do you call it? I
think as a pack. Yeah. I, it's like more,

1860
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:16,830
it's, it's like they have more
of a unified consciousness
than human beings do.

1861
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,420
They're more of one thing.

1862
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:22,710
And so the communication is something
that's not as much based on school of

1863
01:47:22,711 --> 01:47:26,640
Dolphins, a school, a pod,
pod, pod, and you go, yeah,

1864
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:27,750
a plurality of why

1865
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:32,320
they move in very strange ways together
like that. That is kind of cool.

1866
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:33,970
And they also, they, they're,

1867
01:47:33,971 --> 01:47:38,170
they're capable of using sound to like
to like measure where they're at and

1868
01:47:38,171 --> 01:47:40,840
their distances from each
other. Yeah. You know, their,

1869
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:45,610
their languages are really incredibly
evolved and complex and they're really

1870
01:47:45,611 --> 01:47:46,241
beautiful.

1871
01:47:46,241 --> 01:47:50,020
And the fact that they're
like very friendly to human
beings and they're playful

1872
01:47:50,021 --> 01:47:50,854
with human beings.

1873
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:55,860
But what's really freaky is there a rude
as shit to each other regularly rape.

1874
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:00,400
Like they have these rape caves where
they'll tuck a female dolphin in and just

1875
01:48:00,401 --> 01:48:04,240
fucking rape raper forever.
They kill babies on a regular basis.

1876
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:08,010
And then Orca is were killed
dolphins or cause we're talking,

1877
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:12,430
we'll target dolphins and killed that
often talk. Yeah, we were talking about,

1878
01:48:12,431 --> 01:48:15,910
they found that dolphins can, um,
they have names for each other. Yeah,

1879
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:19,280
I know. It's craziness to,
did you see that cartoon?

1880
01:48:19,281 --> 01:48:22,980
Someone did scientifically accurate.
Ducktails well,

1881
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:27,260
you know Brian [inaudible]
it's like duck tales,

1882
01:48:27,261 --> 01:48:30,790
but the way ducks really are that
cartoon ducktails remember duck.

1883
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:35,140
That's so cool. Yeah, it's so true.
It's really violent. And this in it.

1884
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:38,350
Funny and disturbing. Is it violent?
Well, ducks ducks are violent.

1885
01:48:38,351 --> 01:48:40,280
Like all creatures are kind of fucked up.

1886
01:48:40,281 --> 01:48:45,281
I mean all creatures are not like
innocent and it's interesting,

1887
01:48:45,531 --> 01:48:48,500
but ducks,
ducks rape to Jamie

1888
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,481
glasses over there,

1889
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:53,050
right behind your butt or those dirty
glasses or clean glasses think they're

1890
01:48:53,051 --> 01:48:56,830
clean. Likud tell me
what's up. Don't look good.

1891
01:48:57,550 --> 01:49:00,370
Those look like clean glasses. Yeah.
Yeah. Bring those bitches over.

1892
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:03,580
You've got some ice
scientific scientifically.

1893
01:49:03,581 --> 01:49:07,690
I think what they're doing right now
with the, with zoos and dolphins,

1894
01:49:07,691 --> 01:49:10,930
I think this is the last generation
that does that. That's my prediction.

1895
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:14,560
My prediction is that they're going to
realize in a few years that what they're

1896
01:49:14,561 --> 01:49:16,240
doing is,
is really evil.

1897
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:19,210
It's evil and it's unnecessary and
they're not allowed to do it anymore.

1898
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:23,230
The United States is not allowed to kidnap
dolphins and take orchids from their

1899
01:49:23,231 --> 01:49:24,760
families.
They're not allowed to do it anymore,

1900
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,850
so they have to be bred in captivity
or they have some other, like they're,

1901
01:49:28,030 --> 01:49:29,490
they're realizing, oh, this is the sign

1902
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:31,980
talk.

1903
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:36,980
Just going over our debt profile and
another duck ran over his fucking,

1904
01:49:36,991 --> 01:49:39,470
the dead stuck dumping piles.
Beds.

1905
01:49:39,471 --> 01:49:43,860
Why does don't lie pants and
they're shitting their pants?

1906
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:45,633
Male ducks.

1907
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,770
I wonder if,
uh,

1908
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:55,110
various feminist movements have gotten a
hold of this making fun of rape because

1909
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:59,710
this is spread rate. It's just quite rude.
I think this is rape culture. I am not.

1910
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:03,100
I'm going to be awareness about the fact
that ducks are raping each other and

1911
01:50:03,101 --> 01:50:06,910
that it should be stopped. Oh that's
cool. You're cool man. Thank you.

1912
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:11,290
It seems like a,
I mean the way this is this happening,

1913
01:50:11,291 --> 01:50:14,620
it's almost like a rape apologist video.
That's where they had a woman do it.

1914
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,760
Well one, you know she's like the
uncle Tom of the feminist. She sang it.

1915
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:23,770
She sang it. It's not a man. Ducks
rape. Can't believe you said that again.

1916
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:27,940
You what do you,
what about trigger alert people to rape.

1917
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:35,920
Why is that? Why the rave culture
man? I like. What are you,

1918
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:39,020
what's your favorite part about rape
culture? Ah, that paintings the,

1919
01:50:39,021 --> 01:50:42,590
the way the guys breath smells.
I like going down. Yeah.

1920
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:46,930
No I liked the symphonies. It's
like, it's funny how that culture,

1921
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:51,660
I'll have a tiny bit please there.
You could. Tiny bit the culture there.

1922
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:55,370
Well the idea of calling it
like rape culture, that's a,

1923
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:58,600
some people protest that because when
you put something into that sort of a box

1924
01:50:58,601 --> 01:51:01,810
like oh it's rape culture.
Well then what is there a murder culture?

1925
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,010
Cause they're Kinda is right.

1926
01:51:03,011 --> 01:51:06,460
There's a gun culture whenever you
want to like define something as being

1927
01:51:06,461 --> 01:51:10,040
negative, you call it a culture
that Paul was about full. Thank you.

1928
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:15,130
What are we drinking here? I don't know.
That's a company who gave that to us.

1929
01:51:15,131 --> 01:51:18,400
I think somebody gave us
that whiskey while ago. Um,

1930
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:22,660
I think this might've been the Armenians.
We got this Ronda Rousey. You want some?

1931
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:25,780
Oh No, I'm good. Still drunk.
You're still drunk. How dare you.

1932
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:29,320
Brian's live in the crazy rock
and roll life. He really is.

1933
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:32,320
I really caught up to him like
over the last couple of years,

1934
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:35,440
like if you follow his Instagram or his
Twitter while you guys were in saying

1935
01:51:35,441 --> 01:51:40,441
when they were in San Diego for comicon
it's all just drunken rampages and girls

1936
01:51:40,730 --> 01:51:44,110
sticking their butts out. The whole thing
was a mess. That was so much fun man.

1937
01:51:44,111 --> 01:51:46,210
Comic con you ever been to comic con?
I will do.

1938
01:51:46,211 --> 01:51:50,140
One time I even went down there was with
you is when we did shows last year at

1939
01:51:50,141 --> 01:51:53,710
American comedy club, but I didn't
go to the comic con thing at all.

1940
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:56,040
It's too chaotic.

1941
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:59,850
Well, like the guy from breaking
bad, uh, he wore a mask of them.

1942
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,120
It leads guy wore a mask of his character
so nobody would know who he is. Yeah.

1943
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:08,710
And it was like a super realistic mask
was kind of like mission impossible mass.

1944
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,230
So he's like walking around and was
like, oh, can I get a picture with you?

1945
01:52:11,231 --> 01:52:14,920
He's like, yeah, you against
dope. And then, uh, uh, when
they had the, the panel,

1946
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:17,870
they called his name and he
came up out of the audience and,

1947
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,730
and he sat down and was
like, what the fuck? Who,

1948
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,610
who's this weird guy with the mask on?

1949
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,400
And he just takes off his mask and it's
so weird cause he's like taking off his

1950
01:52:24,401 --> 01:52:25,234
own face.

1951
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:30,420
Oh yeah. Maybe I'll go next year. Yeah.

1952
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:32,590
And check it out.
It seems like something you have to do.

1953
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:36,940
I heard Patton Patent recorded
his, uh, his comedy special there.

1954
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:42,150
You did, dude. I seriously, I went to me
and jam band wouldn't, it wasn't yo Benji.

1955
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:46,190
Uh, like we went from the beginning
of the line and walk to see how far

1956
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:48,130
it went and went around
the whole entire place.

1957
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:51,800
Went down the street around this other
building a down this other street.

1958
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:56,270
Like it was the longest line I've ever
seen for standup comedy or was the venue,

1959
01:52:56,271 --> 01:52:59,230
what was the venue? It was a, it was
a theater that was down the street,

1960
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,130
like a big theater. I
don't know, but it was, uh,

1961
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:04,760
it was the one that I did last time. Did
you go with, I didn't know the last time.

1962
01:53:04,761 --> 01:53:08,660
Now it's San Diego's bad ass. I like
it a lot. There's a lot of great spots.

1963
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:12,710
I forget what the Pandora, I want to say
I did the Pandora. Yeah. Think that's it.

1964
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:16,940
Yeah. It's a beautiful theater too.
It's pretty dope. Yeah. There's a,

1965
01:53:16,941 --> 01:53:19,940
there's a house of blues there that's a
great place to perform American comedy

1966
01:53:19,941 --> 01:53:23,240
company. Like it used to be that there
was no comedy clubs in San Diego.

1967
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:26,300
There's today there's mad house right
down the street from that House and

1968
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:29,090
American comedy company together.
And then there's the theaters to,

1969
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:31,730
we used to be the San Diego had La Hoya.

1970
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,870
They had the comedy store and that was it.
But now it's like this,

1971
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,170
like a genuine comedy community down
there. Yeah. Fucking love it down there.

1972
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,540
I love that. It's a comedy
club too, right next to Mexico.

1973
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:46,430
American comedy companies
grade. Go to asco. Uh, no,
but Yoshi almost was it Yoshi?

1974
01:53:46,431 --> 01:53:51,050
Yoshi almost talked me into it because
I guess people are saying that it's not

1975
01:53:51,051 --> 01:53:53,880
as bad as everyone is saying. Like right
when you go over, you just get an attack,

1976
01:53:53,881 --> 01:53:57,710
seek tell him to take you to this one
place and like there's like 200 hookers

1977
01:53:57,711 --> 01:54:00,170
and you just pick which
ones do you want out? Dude,

1978
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:05,170
let me just before anything on my show,
I was interviewing a disease specialists.

1979
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:08,350
Right? I interviewed some new guy who
scared the fucking shit out of me. Oh,

1980
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:13,070
there's a new form of gonorrhea that
they cannot cure the Philippines.

1981
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:17,780
They're finding it in Southeast Asia and
this, this, this form of gonorrhea. Okay.

1982
01:54:17,781 --> 01:54:19,040
That's the warning shot folks.

1983
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:22,970
It's making its way over here
and you can't cure it and
it kills a lot of people.

1984
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,750
Good luck. So you just have like Green
Shit coming out of your Dick for life.

1985
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:30,670
I don't know. I don't know what
happens. It's good question.
Rots off. Falls off it.

1986
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:32,630
Yeah.
I don't know what happens.

1987
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:35,470
I really don't know what happens when
someone says he can't cure gonorrhea.

1988
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:40,280
That ain't good. That can't be good.
That's not good. No, that's fucked up.

1989
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:40,910
That's scary.

1990
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:44,690
One of the things about the show that's
been fucking terrifying is talking to

1991
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:47,540
disease specialists.
Dunkin and I went to Galveston,

1992
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:50,990
Texas and we went to this level four lab,

1993
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:52,820
which is like the highest level.

1994
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:56,120
That's like where they deal
with like Ebola and like,

1995
01:54:56,430 --> 01:55:00,290
you know hemorrhagic viruses
that those hemorrhagic flus,

1996
01:55:00,291 --> 01:55:04,330
they tear apart your body and you just
bleed out of every hole and you turn into

1997
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:07,010
mush. Dude, I was scared to go.

1998
01:55:07,011 --> 01:55:10,400
I was scared to go and Duncan and
I missed our flight. So we went,

1999
01:55:10,401 --> 01:55:14,840
we had like zero hour sleep the next
day we slept for one hour flight.

2000
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:18,080
Like just from talking
just from I think what,

2001
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:21,470
where we weren't even stoned now.
We were just having fun talking.

2002
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:25,310
We're just laughing at the airport,
at the airport, the airport,

2003
01:55:25,490 --> 01:55:30,280
drinking beer and eating pizza and talking
and then we like casually forget that

2004
01:55:30,281 --> 01:55:33,170
there's a time that flight's happen.
Well I was wrong.

2005
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,450
I thought it was 20 minutes
later than it was and they,

2006
01:55:35,451 --> 01:55:38,630
it was 10 minutes before the flight they
had locked the doors and I was like,

2007
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:41,480
oh no. Like why can, why don't you let us
on? Like we've already locked door. I go,

2008
01:55:41,481 --> 01:55:44,070
but it's right there.
You can't let us on. Like

2009
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,290
is it that really that hard to
open the door? I'm not a terrorist.

2010
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:49,370
I didn't like call your name over
the intercoms or maybe they did man.

2011
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:51,290
I don't think so.
Cause he had to take a tram to this.

2012
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,090
Yeah it was, it was a, this
was a crafty situation.

2013
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,620
But the bottom line is Dunkin and I,

2014
01:55:55,621 --> 01:55:59,430
we waited at the airport and then we flew
there and then we went from there with

2015
01:55:59,431 --> 01:55:59,851
no sleep,

2016
01:55:59,851 --> 01:56:04,410
got some coffee and went to meet this
disease specialist at this creepy fucking

2017
01:56:04,411 --> 01:56:06,240
lab where they keep, you know, rabies,

2018
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,420
this is, uh, this lab is a, this,

2019
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:14,510
this lab is straight out of every
movie where like a plague starts.

2020
01:56:14,611 --> 01:56:18,740
It's the, it's like guarded,
it's you and it's got an, uh,

2021
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:21,450
an outside shell around it.

2022
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:26,010
It's got a shell that's basically around
another building that has within it

2023
01:56:26,011 --> 01:56:29,040
different security levels.
And in the deepest security levels,

2024
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,170
that's where they keep
the hemorrhagic fever.

2025
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:33,350
That's where they keep the Bulla forefoot

2026
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:37,450
six cement walls and the whole
deal half of filters. Yeah,

2027
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,100
it was really,
they showed us the filtration system.

2028
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:43,550
I mean they really have it locked down,
but it's in Galveston,

2029
01:56:43,551 --> 01:56:45,430
Texas and it's word tornadoes.

2030
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:48,950
Hurricanes hit like right next
to the ocean and they, they,

2031
01:56:48,951 --> 01:56:53,150
it's like all the good shit is way
up high. So if the water comes in,

2032
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,510
theoretically the water will never
reach the areas where the uh,

2033
01:56:56,511 --> 01:57:01,430
the diseases are. Wow. But
it's just, oh, it's so crazy.

2034
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:03,590
Like when you really stop
and think about what a,

2035
01:57:03,591 --> 01:57:07,950
what a gamble that is like Montana
used to be underwater. Did you,

2036
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:10,250
did you know that like
the whole fucking thing?

2037
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,470
He used to be under the
great western inland sea,

2038
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:16,920
so they're just banking that Galveston
is going to stay above ground. Like what,

2039
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:18,930
what if a massive shift in the,

2040
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:22,790
in the earth's cross happens if there's
a giant earthquake right off the coast,

2041
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:26,060
guess what? That fucker's
underwater now. Yup. I get how,

2042
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:27,590
how well do you have that locked down?

2043
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:30,020
They claim they claim is
totally locked down completely.

2044
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:32,540
I was thinking about it and I was,
you know,

2045
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:36,930
thinking of like the outrage of the light
and the Hubris and all that of having

2046
01:57:36,931 --> 01:57:39,210
like a zoo of deadly viruses.

2047
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:43,890
But then what freaked me out even
more as I realize that's necessary,

2048
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:48,810
we need that because of the gonorrhea
that you're talking about and all the

2049
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:53,220
countless other things that are happening
all over the planet all the time.

2050
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:58,320
That's some of that is definitely the
thing that creeped me out the most doing

2051
01:57:58,561 --> 01:58:02,620
this show was a bio at the
bar by apocalypse. Yeah.

2052
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:07,640
That shit is real and scary and provable
and a matter of time and when you see

2053
01:58:10,261 --> 01:58:12,000
the look on these people's faces,

2054
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:15,300
they look like people with a burden.

2055
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:19,890
There are people who are operating under
the burden of the knowledge that it's

2056
01:58:19,891 --> 01:58:24,891
only a matter of time before the right
duck shit and the right farm yard and the

2057
01:58:25,810 --> 01:58:30,810
right kid eats that duct meat and that
kid sneezes on the right person and 20

2058
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:35,490
million people die.
It's only a matter of time.

2059
01:58:35,491 --> 01:58:37,680
It's like the earthquake
that's going to come to la.

2060
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,740
Like it's not a matter of if,
but when,

2061
01:58:40,741 --> 01:58:45,400
and these people are desperately trying
to understand how to create vaccines for

2062
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:49,710
shit that maybe doesn't even exist
yet. That's scary man. Well there,

2063
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:50,573
they've got ahold of it

2064
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:53,710
so far. What's really,
it's it, it is scary,

2065
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:56,020
but it's also really incredibly
fascinating that we're,

2066
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:59,770
our bodies are essentially ecosystems
that we're not just a person.

2067
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:02,930
You're a whole bunch of different
life forms coexisting together. Yeah.

2068
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:06,820
And there there's more bacteria cells
in your body than there are human cells.

2069
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:11,050
Yeah. Like did the whole thing
is it's a mass, a mass of life.

2070
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:15,140
There's e coli and all this different
flora that lives on your skin.

2071
01:59:15,141 --> 01:59:17,260
And that's one of the
reasons why probiotics.

2072
01:59:17,261 --> 01:59:18,940
So I always see me drinking Kombucha.

2073
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:22,080
I drink this stuff every day or drinking
like crazy and I never get sick.

2074
01:59:22,110 --> 01:59:25,030
Build your immune system as well.
It doesn't just build your immune system.

2075
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:26,710
It actually creates troops.

2076
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:31,570
It creates healthy bacteria troops
that fight off aggressively fight off

2077
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:33,100
incoming troops. Wow. That's,

2078
01:59:33,101 --> 01:59:37,060
so if you come in contact with like
funky colds or weird showing your hands,

2079
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:40,750
the acidophilus and um,
and probiotics,

2080
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:45,610
various probiotics will actually go
after that stuff and keep it from taking

2081
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:49,330
hold. Whereas if you have an
unhealthy skin flora and you know,

2082
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:54,040
ironically what gives you an unhealthy
skin flora using antibacterial soap?

2083
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:58,540
No Shit. Yep. Using antibacterial soap
is bad for you. I didn't cause, yeah,

2084
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:01,420
you most stuff you can cure
with just soap and water.

2085
02:00:01,421 --> 02:00:04,330
Unless you're a surgeon and you're about
to cut someone's heart open and you're

2086
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:07,660
worried about Murcia [inaudible]
what you really want is good soap,

2087
02:00:07,661 --> 02:00:12,460
just soap and there's in fact soap that
actually fosters healthy skin flora.

2088
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:16,750
There's some stuff called defense soap
that a a lot of grapplers use and if you

2089
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:20,260
go to defense soap.com they
sell this healthy soap.

2090
02:00:20,261 --> 02:00:25,060
It has tea tree oil and eucalyptus and
all these natural remedies for healthy

2091
02:00:25,061 --> 02:00:29,740
skin flora promotes healthy skin flora
and cleans off all the negative shit.

2092
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:34,150
You shouldn't be fucking with a
antibacterial soap unless you have a real,

2093
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:35,880
you know,
doctor prescribed.

2094
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,091
That's crazy,
man.

2095
02:00:37,091 --> 02:00:39,910
I didn't know that because when I go to
the airport I'll buy one of those little

2096
02:00:39,911 --> 02:00:42,070
tubes and slather my hands.
That's okay.

2097
02:00:42,490 --> 02:00:45,760
That's okay. That's not that
bad, but putting it on your
hands, it's not that bad.

2098
02:00:45,761 --> 02:00:49,840
When you wash your body with it, that's
when shit gets weird. When, when you it,

2099
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:52,360
you can wash your hands then a
bacterial soap and you'll be fine.

2100
02:00:52,361 --> 02:00:55,900
But regular old soap and water
will kill anything that's bad.

2101
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,930
You should wash your hands,
wash your hands on a regular basis,

2102
02:00:58,931 --> 02:01:01,120
especially when you are touching
a lot of things in public places.

2103
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:03,950
And then you touch your eyes, your face.
I mean that's how things get spread you.

2104
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:07,690
But washing your hands just with
soap and water can fix most of that.

2105
02:01:07,810 --> 02:01:10,660
But when you wash your body
with antibacterial soap,

2106
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:15,340
you really fuck up the whole like
ecosystem on the surface of your skin.

2107
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:19,030
I knew a dude who had, um,
he had like chronic ringworm.

2108
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:23,140
He started getting ringworm from grappling
and started getting it everywhere and

2109
02:01:23,141 --> 02:01:27,010
you know, uh, I think it was Eddie Bravo
school him on it who said like, okay,

2110
02:01:27,011 --> 02:01:29,590
what are you doing? Like how are
you getting this all the time? Like,

2111
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:33,940
what are you taking? Do you use Lamisil?
Am like, oh, something that kills it.

2112
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:37,420
Do you take probiotics? Like you
got to not use antibacterial soap.

2113
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:42,050
You've got to figure out how to like bring
your body back to health because this

2114
02:01:42,051 --> 02:01:45,230
is like a symptom of an issue.
These,

2115
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:47,870
what ringworm is,
is a,

2116
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:52,880
an invading army and it's got a stronghold
in your system and as a strong in

2117
02:01:52,991 --> 02:01:54,410
your system because your system's week.

2118
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:57,260
So let's figure out why your
systems a week. Like what is it?

2119
02:01:57,261 --> 02:02:00,530
And that's the holistic approach. They're
very few people take, they just go,

2120
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:03,810
I'll go to put your man and bacterial
soap on his back to prom. Right.

2121
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:08,000
It's not just that there's, you're,
you're a whole system, you know, it's,

2122
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,270
but it's really hard for us to wrap our
hands because I'm not a system of me.

2123
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:15,530
You're Duncan Trussell. That's, you know,
that's Brian. Like we're people, right?

2124
02:02:15,531 --> 02:02:19,400
I'm a person. I know who I am and you're
not. No, you're, you're, you're, you're,

2125
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:23,740
there's like a consciousness
that's moving the school of cells,

2126
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:27,740
you know, and the school of cells is
of, there's a lot of shit going on.

2127
02:02:27,741 --> 02:02:29,120
That's fucking crazy,
man.

2128
02:02:29,121 --> 02:02:33,500
That's a crazy thing to think about that
we're just like a tightly woven school

2129
02:02:33,501 --> 02:02:37,730
of bacterial fish swimming
through the coral reef of matters.

2130
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:41,630
Do you one better the each individual
cells almost entirely space.

2131
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:44,510
So we don't even know what the
fuck we are. We're just, we're,

2132
02:02:44,511 --> 02:02:48,350
we're this combination of different
cells that share some sort of a strange

2133
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:52,790
relationship with each other,
you know, and each cell is
mostly just nothing. Yeah,

2134
02:02:52,791 --> 02:02:54,320
it's a harmony.
And by the way,

2135
02:02:54,321 --> 02:02:58,520
it's a harmony that is destined to fly
apart into a million pieces eventually.

2136
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:00,650
That's the other, definitely. Maybe,

2137
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:03,800
maybe the figure out a way around that
Daca Trussell maybe that's an what were

2138
02:03:03,801 --> 02:03:05,790
talking about when we did the,

2139
02:03:05,791 --> 02:03:09,740
the robot apocalypse show where we
deal with Robo sapiens. All these,

2140
02:03:09,870 --> 02:03:14,600
when we went to Dunkin and I and Ra went
to this global future 2045 conference

2141
02:03:14,601 --> 02:03:16,210
in New York City and met
with all these futurists.

2142
02:03:16,211 --> 02:03:17,990
Are we going to get in
trouble saying all this stuff?

2143
02:03:17,991 --> 02:03:20,330
I know we're supposed to keep
our lit or, well, we're not,

2144
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,850
we're not giving away
any, um, any secrets.

2145
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:24,440
We're just talking about
how bad ass it was.

2146
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:27,590
That was bad conversations we've
got to have with these people. Yeah,

2147
02:03:27,591 --> 02:03:30,650
it was amazing. We're, we're,
we're, we're in strange times.

2148
02:03:30,651 --> 02:03:35,651
People strange fucking times and
getting stranger every God damn day.

2149
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:38,600
Yeah. It's true. Every day it's
getting weirder and weirder.

2150
02:03:38,601 --> 02:03:42,830
Beautiful and weird and, and I wish,

2151
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:46,580
it's just an interesting thing, man. I'll
tell you, if you keep doing this show,

2152
02:03:46,581 --> 02:03:50,630
man, you're going to stumble upon
something fucked up. I don't think so.

2153
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:53,250
I think so. That's you,
man. You always go to that

2154
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:55,130
dead babies,
Nancy grace,

2155
02:03:55,131 --> 02:03:58,310
you're going to stumble on
some demonic possession thing.

2156
02:03:58,311 --> 02:04:00,590
You're going to be in the woods.
You're going to find some people.

2157
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:03,710
They're going to be sacrificing virgin.
You're going to have to make a decision,

2158
02:04:03,711 --> 02:04:07,340
man, and it's going to be like a
star trek thing or star craft thing.

2159
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:11,120
You're going to have to move your dongle's
into a certain parents. Dongles out,

2160
02:04:11,121 --> 02:04:13,740
dare you.
There's no dongles and star starcraft.

2161
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:18,360
Yeah. The angrier he got. Yeah. Oh, it
was real. It was real folks. It was real.

2162
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:19,540
It was beautiful.
But it was real.

2163
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:25,200
Duncan Trussell is back on economy horse
and he will be appearing tonight at the

2164
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,640
Ice House was lovely comedy or something.

2165
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:30,090
Know what this is going to be like
Thompson Guerra. Why do you say that?

2166
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:34,020
How dare you? Don't be
negative. You creating your own
reality. This is the secret.

2167
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:37,880
Okay. Yeah. I haven't been on
stage in two months. He used to see

2168
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,250
every comic. I knew I been on
stage. It's going to be great.

2169
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,790
It's going to be the
Greek side of my window

2170
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:48,470
that hasn't been on stage
in what says what it says.

2171
02:04:48,471 --> 02:04:50,380
What if you haven't been on
stage and two months that sock.

2172
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:52,900
Can you get a spanking
from the gods of comedy?

2173
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:57,420
Come on.
We all know this.

2174
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,330
I took three months off
once. Wow. Yeah, yeah.

2175
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:06,530
Long time ago I got just, I was burnt
out and I just decided, you know what?

2176
02:05:06,531 --> 02:05:07,910
I'm in the middle of so much shit.

2177
02:05:07,911 --> 02:05:11,600
Let me just take some Tylenol and it was
the longest I'd ever taken off a comedy

2178
02:05:11,780 --> 02:05:15,230
and then I remember getting back on
stage. It was like, Oh, this is nice.

2179
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:19,250
Like immediately fell right back into
it. I miss it. First setback was weird.

2180
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:20,900
Second setback was comfortable.

2181
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,090
Yeah Man, I'm, I'm, I'm excited
about it but I know I've got,

2182
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,610
I've got to pay the piper a little
bit and I'm willing to pay the right.

2183
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:28,950
You're still performing.

2184
02:05:28,951 --> 02:05:33,170
See that's one of the things that I've
found about doing podcasts and uh,

2185
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,950
doing them on a regular basis.

2186
02:05:34,951 --> 02:05:38,580
Especially like you get used to
talking in front of people, you get,

2187
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:42,330
you get you the, the like the
anxiety that fucks up your set,

2188
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:45,720
that that's alleviated.
You're always going on these rants.

2189
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:49,710
I mean you're doing these rants when we
do the podcast for the show in front of

2190
02:05:49,711 --> 02:05:53,130
like just the suits and the
camera people and the, the,

2191
02:05:53,131 --> 02:05:56,610
the folks that work on the show
and you're going right into it,

2192
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:59,550
go right in the flow. You're not being
self conscious. You know, you're,

2193
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:01,050
you're completely in the moment.

2194
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:04,560
And I think a lot of that has to
do with doing a lot of podcasts.

2195
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:09,000
Yes, for sure. It's just,
yes. It's definitely a skill
that you develop and you get,

2196
02:06:09,030 --> 02:06:12,600
you get, you get better at your right
man. It is a form of performance and it's,

2197
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:15,450
uh, yeah, I love it. It's really fun.

2198
02:06:15,451 --> 02:06:18,450
It's a lot less anxiety
provoking then getting onstage,

2199
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:20,560
but I'm excited about
getting on stage again.

2200
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:23,940
I want to get back into walking
around the ice house, you know,

2201
02:06:23,941 --> 02:06:28,050
just like being in a comedy club, this
thing starts arising in me like, fuck,

2202
02:06:28,051 --> 02:06:32,460
I miss this man that it, but it, it, it
becomes such a huge part of your life,

2203
02:06:32,461 --> 02:06:34,800
you know? But it's like sometimes
you do have to take a break.

2204
02:06:34,801 --> 02:06:39,300
I had to take a break. I, there's just,
I couldn't go on stage after my mom died.

2205
02:06:39,301 --> 02:06:42,810
I was just too weird. It was
like, I just, I didn't, I didn't,

2206
02:06:42,811 --> 02:06:45,590
just didn't want to spend any
mental energy dealing with that.

2207
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:47,180
I think I told you about the,

2208
02:06:47,181 --> 02:06:50,290
the time I went on stage after
Phil Hartman and died, well,

2209
02:06:50,330 --> 02:06:52,410
I had one of the worst sets in my life,
like you have to,

2210
02:06:52,411 --> 02:06:55,410
Phil Hartman died where
I fucked up and I, I, I,

2211
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,130
I was just starting getting my stage legs
back under me and then I was at a gas

2212
02:06:59,131 --> 02:07:02,750
station. I ran into a friend
who's a police officer and uh,

2213
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:06,780
he gave me some details about the case
that I didn't know. Yeah. And it was,

2214
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:08,700
I'll spare everyone the more but details.

2215
02:07:08,701 --> 02:07:10,530
But it was enough to really
freak me the fuck out.

2216
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:13,320
And then I went on stage and just,
I couldn't be funny.

2217
02:07:13,321 --> 02:07:16,740
It was impossible and I had nothing
funny to say. I just ate shit.

2218
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:20,010
And I knew in the middle of it that I
was never going to pull myself out of it.

2219
02:07:20,011 --> 02:07:22,950
I knew I shouldn't have been up there.
I should have taken more time off,

2220
02:07:22,951 --> 02:07:25,110
you know, whatever I,
whatever amount of time,

2221
02:07:25,111 --> 02:07:27,810
I don't remember how many weeks it was.
I took her off. It just wasn't enough.

2222
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:31,050
Sometimes I think you got to do that.
And I think in comedy sometimes a,

2223
02:07:31,051 --> 02:07:33,810
a more of a uh,
uh,

2224
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:37,150
athletic mentality applied to it,
which is like you just got to punk,

2225
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:39,940
keep constantly punching the bag
no matter what. No matter what,

2226
02:07:39,941 --> 02:07:42,340
just punched the bag no matter what,
just just go through it.

2227
02:07:42,341 --> 02:07:45,370
And I think if you're going to be
doing stand up for your whole life,

2228
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:46,510
Shit's gonna happen.

2229
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:50,350
That's gonna make you have to take
some breaks from time to time.

2230
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:50,800
Well,

2231
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:55,150
even in that as an athletic point of view
is a bad point of view because one of

2232
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:55,271
the,

2233
02:07:55,271 --> 02:08:00,270
one of the key things to athletes is don't
get yourself in a Rut and keep going.

2234
02:08:00,610 --> 02:08:05,170
Recognize what you're doing,
step back, assess, reanalyze,

2235
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:09,880
go back into it. And also if you get
injured, don't keep going. Blow rest up.

2236
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:14,920
Okay. Give yourself some recuperation.
And I think that a, a life injury,

2237
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:15,911
like you know,

2238
02:08:15,911 --> 02:08:19,450
losing a loved one that's a life injury
and you've got to recuperate from that

2239
02:08:19,451 --> 02:08:22,480
injury and you have to deal
with the emotional damage
the same way you deal with

2240
02:08:22,481 --> 02:08:24,400
the damage.
To a ligament or damage to a muscle.

2241
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:29,110
Yeah, and it and it all and then you
can it grief. Grief has its own pattern.

2242
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:32,020
It's really curious because you
can see that there's like a,

2243
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:35,200
a cyclical thing where in like it's,

2244
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:38,020
it's terrible in cycles,

2245
02:08:38,021 --> 02:08:42,880
but then the that gets better and better
and better and it's really interesting,

2246
02:08:42,881 --> 02:08:45,880
man. It's a very natural thing,
but I don't know how p I,

2247
02:08:45,881 --> 02:08:50,130
and I've heard of comics who after their
folks die, like you keep doing standup.

2248
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:51,430
I just don't know how you do that.

2249
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:55,290
It's like you got to sit on the
bench for a while and then you buy,

2250
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:56,710
I just bought a bird feeder.

2251
02:08:57,180 --> 02:09:00,640
I bought bird feeders and just
sat on my porch and you know,

2252
02:09:00,641 --> 02:09:02,410
like I was like feeding or
right after it happened,

2253
02:09:02,411 --> 02:09:04,810
I was sitting on my porch and
I bird feeders and the birds,

2254
02:09:04,811 --> 02:09:07,150
it started showing up. I'm
like, ah, this is great man.

2255
02:09:07,151 --> 02:09:11,320
This is really nice and peaceful and birds
are showing up to the bird feeder and

2256
02:09:11,321 --> 02:09:16,120
then there's this lack in a fucking bird
flew into the window right in front of

2257
02:09:16,121 --> 02:09:16,954
me.

2258
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:20,060
I'm like,
I can't escape death.

2259
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:25,220
Kill the fucking bird. Stop
getting so comfortable, bitch.

2260
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:30,570
And on that note, I love you
buddy. I love you too. Hey,

Those spores will take over the universe
and then those spores will eventually

02:10:09,241 --> 02:10:14,130
be housed in Galveston, Texas
behind 15 miles of glass. We need,

out there for a pimp. I'm not a pimp.

2277
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:32,970
He's a pimp. You're a pimp too. Love
you guys. What does that even mean?

2278
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:35,320
What a terrible way to end it.
We were doing so well and I just,

2279
