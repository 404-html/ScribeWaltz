1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,883
Hello Freak bitches.
So what did you guys do for 

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:06,990
entertainment when you're in there?
Oh Shit.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,750
Did you do stand up in there at all?
Yeah,

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:10,584
I did later on.
That's a crazy question and no one's 

5
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:14,450
really ever asked me that,
but that's what joey got started,

6
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,440
you know?
Yeah.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,400
But it was different because in my last,
my last year and a half,

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm locked up in Norco,
so all these guards are Mexican,

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,400
most of them are Mexican and they're 
like,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,370
I used to fucking see you at wild 
coyote.

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,680
They're like,
I just seen you on showtime.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,770
And they're like,
you're at the Ontario Improv.

13
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:38,090
So you know,
they got together and uh,

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,590
there were like a,
a,

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,690
you want to do comedy.
And I was just like,

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,300
fuck,
I did not want this.

17
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,650
I did not want like to be popular,
you know what I mean?

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,960
Like I didn't want to stay low key.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,940
Yeah.
Then I was just like a,

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,291
I don't know,
man,

21
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,930
like I'm offensive,
I'll say something that'll start a riot.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,601
And they're like,
Nah,

23
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:58,870
Nah,
Nah,

24
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,703
Nah.
Other races already said you can say 

25
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,154
whatever you want.
Like they planned this shit and I was 

26
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:04,621
like,
all right,

27
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,350
I'll do it.
So all the races.

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,440
So you have to have like a little race 
knowing.

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,350
Fuck yeah.
Hell yeah.

30
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,510
So how does that go down?
It's,

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,160
I don't know,
I wasn't involved in it.

32
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,510
It's just so they had to meet with maybe
the guard went up to the white rep,

33
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,010
the black wrap and all the reps was 
like,

34
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,844
hey man,
check it out.

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,430
You guys.
We have a celebrity comedian here.

36
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,870
That's how they pumped me up.
I was like,

37
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,704
motherfucker can't even get a week at 
the Improv but I could get a week in 

38
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:34,840
prison.
That's a good note.

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,570
Thank you.
So uh,

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,280
it was,
it was.

41
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,240
Oh man,
it was weird.

42
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:41,340
I was scared as hell,
like,

43
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:46,341
no Mike.
And they put me in the TV room and there

44
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:50,870
was like 60 straight,
like fools,

45
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:53,400
like just like come on dog,
make us laugh.

46
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,430
And like,
you know,

47
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,303
they'd never heard my jokes.
So I did my whole set and they're just 

48
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,670
like,
oh.

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,000
And then I guess one of the cops,
this is the weird part,

50
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,863
is all the cops left their dorms to come
watch this show and they went back and 

51
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,054
then they told the inmates,
so when I go to yard the next day the 

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,420
inmates were like,
hey dog,

53
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,030
how much you charge?
Come do a show in our room.

54
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643
And I was like,
what do you mean that like I heard you 

55
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,910
did comedy and everybody said it was 
cool.

56
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:22,440
All the racist said you were cool.

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,273
And I was just like,
I don't think I can go to your dorm did 

58
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:28,320
that's like against the code.
So the cops would be like,

59
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,154
all right everybody give them an item 
and you can go in there and perform an 

60
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,400
item.
An item is like a soup,

61
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,110
a hot chocolate.
That's how people are paid to show.

62
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,400
Wow.
Yeah.

63
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,460
And it got to the point where I did 
every everyone on,

64
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,700
on our yard and I assembled like a 
little crew.

65
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,480
I,
I'm,

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,313
I taught this guy had an opening for me 
because he was cool as Druggie from 

67
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,340
whittier.
He was just,

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,750
he was stupid.
Fucking taught him how to do standup and

69
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,230
he knew it but didn't know.
He knew it.

70
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,790
He knew it,
but he never did it.

71
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,624
Jack [inaudible] like,
I remember he'd be like eight dog when 

72
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,200
I'm on the street.
He has fucked up teeth.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,790
It's like,
I call.

74
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,600
I called girls and I'm like,
they're like,

75
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,860
how's your body?
And he's like,

76
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:16,090
I just smiled like Chisel.
I was like,

77
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,530
oh,
that's a setup right there.

78
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,760
Like you're just.
He did it.

79
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:22,600
And uh,
the look on his face was cool man,

80
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,220
but I just remember he was like,
Hey dog,

81
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm gonna hit you up when I get out.
We're going to go on the tour.

82
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,290
I'm like,
no,

83
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,960
you're a fucking tweaker ah,
well it's fine.

84
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,000
Because people that can make people 
laugh.

85
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,140
If I always tell people,
like,

86
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,860
if you can make your friends laugh,
you can make people,

87
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,760
you know,
laugh.

88
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,970
It's entirely possible.
You could be a comedian.

89
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,970
It's the same thing.
It's just a matter of whether or not you

90
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:49,120
get these people to allow you inside 
their head.

91
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,580
Yeah.
That's kind of what it is,

92
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,240
right?
Yeah.

93
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,950
The true comfortableness.
But you know,

94
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,813
some of them wasn't like I had a rough 
time a couple first 10 minutes because 

95
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,854
fools are like,
I thought you were going to do George 

96
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,190
Lopez his jokes.
I was like,

97
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,150
no,
I'm not,

98
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,260
I'm,
I'm not an impersonator.

99
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,280
Like,
like fools were pissed.

100
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,930
They're like,
hey,

101
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,310
you didn't do any member members or 
nothing like that.

102
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,930
Oh,
that's funny.

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,393
So they just thought,
stand up comedy is kind of like music 

104
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,280
now.
Yeah,

105
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,114
like you would just go up there and do 
like some hits they didn't know this is 

106
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,320
the crazy part is uh,
the award and catches wind of this shit.

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,633
And I'm in a program called sap,
it's substance abuse program and I'm 

108
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,850
only in it because you qualify for 
halftime if you take this program.

109
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,390
So the wardens like,
hey Sacramento's coming down here,

110
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,940
I want to show them a rehabilitated con 
or criminal,

111
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,761
whatever.
I'm a felon,

112
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,020
whatever.
So I was like,

113
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:44,831
what are you talking about?
He's like,

114
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:49,090
well you do comedy in front of the 
program and Sacramento.

115
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,953
But no cussing a no was like,
I think this was the easiest deal I've 

116
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:57,761
ever made.
I said,

117
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:58,594
look,
I'll do it if you bring me Kentucky 

118
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,330
Fried Chicken and Soda Joe.
I was just saying that the talk show,

119
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,900
because you know how like when I first 
started getting gigs,

120
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,810
I'd always called joy is they're going 
to give me $700 if I go do visalia town,

121
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,650
2000 dumb ass that it.

122
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,093
So after the show he gives me two,
two liters of coke and a fucking bucket 

123
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,410
of Kentucky man.
And he was just like,

124
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,110
I remember walking back and everybody 
was like,

125
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,290
I gave all my people a piece and it was 
just like,

126
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,550
it was Kinda like,
uh,

127
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,384
that movie,
Shawshank redemption when they're 

128
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,290
drinking on the roof.
It was like the first time,

129
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:45,430
like we ate outside food,
like haven't had a soda in years.

130
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,960
So everybody was like,
I was just like,

131
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
okay,
get down home.

132
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,000
He was like,
oh,

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,770
it was cool.
Wow,

134
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,783
that's fucking cool.
There's something cool about 

135
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,843
appreciating something that you,
you just take for granted because you 

136
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,634
can get it anytime you want,
but when you're so restricted you get 

137
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,680
those things and it's so good.
Yeah.

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,980
No,
they loved it.

139
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,860
They loved it and it was cool because 
like a lot.

140
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,860
I mean dude,
I made friends,

141
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,540
like there's guys I still talk to.
There's like friends and it was,

142
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,040
yeah,
it was awesome.

143
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,560
Like how can I say that?
How was prison?

144
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,394
Awesome.
But it was like when people say that 

145
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,100
about war to men,
you know,

146
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,143
people say that about,
I think human beings need a certain 

147
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:26,714
amount of struggle.
And then when you experienced that 

148
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,080
struggle than the non struggle feel so 
much better.

149
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,121
You know,
there's,

150
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:36,020
there's moments where I've talked about 
this before,

151
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,854
but I,
when I'm a hunting in Alaska on this 

152
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:44,180
island,
Prince of Wales and it rained every day.

153
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,030
We were there for six days.
Pouring rain,

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
drenched haver hunting.
Yeah,

155
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,140
we were.
It was the worst,

156
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,233
like as far as like getting wet and just
being soaked and cold all the time to 

157
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,760
one of the worst experiences you could 
ever go through because you're just,

158
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,860
it's always like 45,
50 degrees pouring rain and you know,

159
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,960
you're sleeping bags with the inside of 
your tents.

160
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,830
Wet.
Everything's wet.

161
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,210
But when I came back,
I remember it was sunny out and I called

162
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,690
my friend Steve Rinella who,
uh,

163
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,460
took me with him on this trip I go to.
I've never been happier in my life.

164
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,383
Like the sun is shining like what I 
normally just totally take for granted 

165
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,650
exact.
I was like,

166
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,430
it's amazing.
I love it.

167
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,690
I'm like,
I'm driving on the street.

168
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,790
Um,
so I don't think I've ever been happier,

169
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,750
but I was that happy because I had gone 
through the struggle.

170
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,090
But nobody wants to do that on their 
own,

171
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:32,924
you know?
And when you're kind of forced into a 

172
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,110
situation,
I would imagine like being in prison.

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,200
Then when you get that Kentucky Fried 
Chicken and you get that soda,

174
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,130
you're like,
wow,

175
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,260
we're,
we're fucking living it up right now.

176
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,190
Because I,
I,

177
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,130
I came from a place.
They have this thing,

178
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:49,340
it's called a fuck.
I forgot what it's called,

179
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,174
but you have money in your books.
Everybody has money and they do like a 

180
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,603
sell off.
Or they'll go to the local vons by the 

181
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:59,600
prison and they'll buy.
You can buy sodas,

182
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,830
cookies,
and pizza.

183
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,970
But nobody ever had Kentucky Fried 
Chicken in that bitch.

184
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,610
Like to this day,
that's like my.

185
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,940
I want to put that in my.
In my.

186
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,380
Like my bio had Kentucky Fried Chicken 
in prison.
