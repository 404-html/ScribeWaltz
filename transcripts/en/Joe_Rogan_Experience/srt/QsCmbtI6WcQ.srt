1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,080
And you know what's
amazing is every podcast,

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:07,410
no matter how long I end up hanging out
with the guest for another 45 minutes

4
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:08,640
afterwards and you're like,

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,500
they don't want to leave on
the people don't want to leave.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:10,910
And it could,

7
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,671
could've just kept going.

8
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:11,980
Yeah.

9
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,990
And well I do,

10
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:14,250
I do to a point.

11
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,470
I always feel like a lot of times,

12
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,760
cause I do the series show first,

13
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,310
I've already given me an hour and then
I usually shoot a video with them.

14
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,430
I do this thing called talk your way
out of it where I give people and uncle,

15
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,360
I'll do it to you right now.

16
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,690
Okay.

17
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,930
I'm going to give you an uncomfortable
situation and in a split second,

18
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,050
you're going to have to talk your way
out of it as if you're talking to the

19
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:31,590
person.

20
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:31,800
Okay?

21
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,633
All right.

22
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,103
Um,

23
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,260
are you go to the doctor's office and,

24
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:37,710
uh,

25
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,460
he's gonna,

26
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,960
he's gonna check you out.

27
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,890
So,

28
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,520
um,

29
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,020
he bends you over the table.

30
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,470
Okay.

31
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,921
And you got it.

32
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:44,041
Hey,

33
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,040
this is how I just,

34
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,170
I forgot the rubber gloves.

35
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,004
He walks out.

36
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,930
You notice that the
medicine cabinet is opened.

37
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:49,441
You reach in,

38
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:50,640
you find a bottle of Vicodin.

39
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,680
You see it as he's coming in,

40
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,670
he's going to bust you.

41
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,420
You take it,

42
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,710
you stick it up your ass to hide it.

43
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,720
The doctor spreads you cheeks.

44
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,280
He wants to look at you and
wants to look at your colon.

45
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,330
He puts his finger and he pulls out the
bottle of Viking and talk your way out

46
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,090
of it.

47
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:07,331
Oh,

48
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,260
that's where that was.

49
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,063
Five words.

50
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,831
Five words.

51
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:15,940
It's all you're going to Claire.

52
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,110
Oh,

53
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,943
that's where it is.

54
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:20,990
Thanking them.

55
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,240
Thanking maybe,

56
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,870
but no,

57
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,070
usually it takes like two minutes.

58
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,570
People talk around it.

59
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,360
They described you average five words.

60
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,580
Just go rifle.

61
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,221
C'Mon man,

62
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:33,820
you can't,

63
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,780
you're already busted.

64
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,030
I found a vitamin bottle up your ass.

65
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:37,720
You're a freak.

66
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,553
I did that.

67
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,040
I did that to know that that
particular one I thought of,

68
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,010
cause my last show is with
Natasha and I did that to her,

69
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:47,250
but it was in her pussy and she had
her feet in the stirrups and she goes,

70
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,701
oh,

71
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,080
I was just tightening that for you.

72
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,790
Oh yeah.

73
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,800
Cheer up fucking human being.
