1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,400
Sweet baby.
Jesus.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,830
Here we go again.
Did Jesus people get upset?

3
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:12,831
Have you?
Sweet Baby Jesus and like a nice way 

4
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:12,831
because I know they get pissed.
If you say Jesus fucking Christ,

5
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:13,490
they don't like that.
No.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,750
If you say sweet baby,
Jesus in the manger,

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,560
it's good.
It's all good.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,530
How about if you only say sweet baby 
Jesus in a nice way.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,200
See Baby Jesus.
Sweet Baby Jesus.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,890
Sexually sounding though like 
pedophiles.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,290
You're tasting Jesus.
Sweet.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,940
Sweet.
You do.

13
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,580
Don't they do eat the flesh and drink 
the blood anyway?

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,350
Yeah,
that got freaky.

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,500
He's responsible for basically any 
creepy notions that people have just by 

16
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:42,030
that,
even if that's true,

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,490
why tell people,
but keep the kid.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,950
Give him some bread and wine,
which we barely believe he came back 

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,950
from the dead.
All right,

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,620
we're supposed to eat you,
drink you.

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,190
This has nothing to do with anything.

What is audible?
Did you pay attention to the second 

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:13,430
part?
Pitch?

27
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,610
I said audio book,
put it together for yourself.

28
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,210
What do you think audible is?
Well,

29
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,230
audible.com
is an amazing resource of thousands and 

30
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,630
thousands of audio books.
It's really bad ass of your commuter.

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,780
Like we can only put out so many 
podcasts and most likely,

32
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:32,781
if you're like me,
the reason why this podcast started a 

33
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:35,120
half an hour late because we live in Los
Angeles and there's too many fucking 

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,391
people here.
So you get stuck in your car and it 

35
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,240
could either be frustrating or you can 
listen to some cool shit.

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,350
Uh,
I was,

37
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:45,351
uh,
listening on the way up here to a 

38
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:47,280
podcast so you can do that.
Or you can listen to audio books because

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,730
in podcast oftentimes,
especially if you read this,

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,020
listen to this one,
you're going to get a lot of information

41
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,180
that might not necessarily be true.

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,960
It also might not necessarily,
might not necessarily be able to be 

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,281
pronounced.
It might not necessarily be good for 

44
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:07,041
you.
We might tell you some shit just for a 

45
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:07,041
goof.
Okay?

46
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,370
But if you get like a really good book,
at the very least you might learn 

47
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,720
something.
There's a whisper sync,

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,670
which is one of my favorite new 
applications.

49
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:19,671
It's really one of the coolest things 
I've ever heard of and what it is for 

50
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:24,020
audible.com.
It's an application that allows you to 

51
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,700
download a book and a companion audio 
book.

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,330
So say if you're at home reading your 
book and you get to page 23 and then you

53
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:35,331
fall asleep when you get in your car,
you have it sync up through this whisper

54
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,900
sync,
a audible.com

55
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,590
application and it syncs up to your 
smartphone and then when you get in your

56
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:45,591
car,
the version of the audio book picks up 

57
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,010
where you left off.
It's fucking brilliant.

58
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,340
It is such a great idea and such a great
product and Ufford fantastic reviews of 

59
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:58,851
this where people are super psyched,
so I'm more books are starting to put 

60
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:02,200
those in a companion audio versions of 
the book,

61
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,320
but you can get all of 
them@aaudible.com.

62
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,260
Anything that has one of those,
a companion books

63
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,160
and look what they have all your 
appearances on.

64
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,500
Opie and Anthony,
they have your cds.

65
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,730
They have a bunch of shit.

66
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,230
Yeah,
they have pretty much anything you could

67
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,040
ask for,
you know,

68
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,490
as far as like comedy as far as 
interesting books,

69
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,850
books by our friends like well to do.
They have Tim Ferriss,

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,090
Tim Ferriss at war with them.
How's that work?

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,600
Because I know Tim Ferriss at war with 
all the regular book dealers.

72
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:36,601
Right.
There was like a big issue that he had 

73
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:36,601
there.
They're trying to barnes and noble.

74
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Barnes and Bobo.
Why you fucking with our friend Tim 

75
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Ferriss?
You silly silly bitch.

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:41,970
I know.

77
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,580
Steven Pressfield is a great read of his
books.

78
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,530
I've listened to some of his own.
It's actually him reading it and talking

79
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:49,920
to you.
So

80
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,940
no,
those are perfect to recommend because 

81
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:54,940
those are two of my favorite books of 
all time turning pro,

82
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,710
which is the newest one.
Um,

83
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,750
and uh,
Steven Pressfield put out a book that 

84
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,840
changed a lot of people's lives in the 
creative business and it's called the 

85
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,161
war of art.
And it deals with one thing that really 

86
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,460
fucks with a lot of people and that's 
procrastination,

87
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,160
procrastination and what he calls 
resistance,

88
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,420
meaning that you're,
you're most happy when you get your work

89
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:18,790
done,
when you do the things you,

90
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,450
especially creatively that you want to 
do.

91
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,690
But for a lot of us,
we struggle with this thing that makes 

92
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,240
us fuck off and you know,
instead of doing what you're supposed to

93
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:32,720
do,
you beat off you email people you find,

94
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,520
you find shit to do,
to distract you.

95
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,550
And he details us and explains this.
And one of the clearest and most 

96
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,660
beneficial ways I think I've ever heard 
it described,

97
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,370
you'll be surprised you.
You read his book,

98
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,950
you feel like he's talking to you and be
like,

99
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,860
Steven,
what's up?

100
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:54,861
How'd you get in my head?
Because all of the things that prevent 

101
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,260
you from doing what you could and what 
you should do,

102
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,330
he's talking about the fears,
the doubts.

103
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:02,331
The procrastination is like you 
mentioned all of that and gives it a 

104
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:02,331
name resistance.
And once you name it,

105
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:07,220
then you can kill it.
It's like that Arnold Schwarzenegger 

106
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,220
with a Predator once,
I believe it's.

107
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,220
You can kill it.
Yeah.

108
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,360
And the cool thing about pressfield 
pressfield as a human being was 

109
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,330
essentially a failure at the time he 
started.

110
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,620
Got it all together when he was in his 
forties.

111
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,840
It's really interesting because,
you know,

112
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,890
he's very,
very frank about his old habits and very

113
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:28,891
frank about his old work and you know,
what was wrong with the early part of 

114
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:31,360
his,
his career as a writer and how he turned

115
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,160
it around.
And now it's hugely,

116
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:38,161
hugely respected and you know,
written huge selling books on history 

117
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,150
has some screenplays that were turned 
into movies like the legend of Bagger 

118
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,620
Vance,
which probably isn't a good example 

119
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:49,620
because it looked like a piece of shit.
Then it,

120
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,720
oh,
it's magical black guy that's good at 

121
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:53,720
golf.
The fuck out of here,

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,120
Steven Pressfield,
but,

123
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,100
but turning pro in the more of our 
excellent audible.com

124
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,980
forward slash Joe.

125
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,510
Go there,
you fuck and get it free for 30 days and

126
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,720
you get a free audio book.
And I would recommend the war of art 

127
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:07,880
because it's fucking sensational.
And you said it's that right?

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,050
Uh,
it should be.

129
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,570
I've heard it on audio powerful,
audible and uh,

130
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,330
we're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com.

131
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,510
And what a coincidence at all.
[inaudible] and is here buddy?

132
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,410
Well,
that's crazy.

133
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,710
Why don't you tell everybody about the 
latest shit because every time I turn 

134
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,170
around there's new stuff.
There's some Himalayan sea salt,

135
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,620
which is that a new better for you than 
regular season Himalayan sea salt.

136
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:33,621
The deal with that is normal sea salt.
They artificially produce it and it's 

137
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,900
sodium chloride.
It's artificially produced.

138
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,530
So it's not really coming from the 
ocean.

139
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:41,531
Just bond the chemicals together.
And what happens is when they call that 

140
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,820
sea salt sea salt,
but just regular table salt,

141
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,980
like what you'll find at your denny's 
diner or whatever,

142
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:46,760
you know,
that kind of.

143
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,010
And what they did is they found that 
people started getting mineral 

144
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,700
imbalances when they created that and 
having health problems,

145
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:57,701
particularly from the lack of iodine 
that people were acquiring mostly from 

146
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:01,691
their salt.
So that's why you get iodized salt 

147
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:01,691
because they threw that back in there.
Like,

148
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,330
all right,
well at least give them iodine back,

149
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,540
but what they're missing is the 81 other
trace minerals that are found in a 

150
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,140
natural salt.
The Himalayan salt,

151
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,010
so has about 80,
80 more minerals than regular salt.

152
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:16,400
It's a great source to get your mineral 
content and in addition,

153
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:21,401
the reason why the Himalayan is most 
preferred is because the deposits are 

154
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,851
like $300,
million years old and that's before 

155
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:27,491
there was pollution as before big old 
ships dropped petroleum bombs into our 

156
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:30,350
waters and polluted the sea salt and 
everything like that.

157
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:35,351
It's just a really pristine deposit of 
salt because it was back in the days 

158
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:36,370
where there is just volcano.

159
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,020
No dinosaur.
Yeah,

160
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,680
that's it.
So you know,

161
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,490
Tara dactyl poo is like the.
That was the problem back then as far as

162
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,680
far as pollution.
So when you buy a biologist,

163
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,060
let's just be clear about this though.
When you buy sea salt though,

164
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,460
something says sea salt,
it has to come from the ocean.

165
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Sea Salt is pretty good because we kind 
of said that accidentally earlier you 

166
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,290
were saying they make it,
but I think he just meant tables.

167
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,860
Table salt table,
salt table,

168
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:05,670
so the difference between sea salt and 
Himalayan Sea salt is what?

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,390
It's just more nutritious.
It's nutrition as,

170
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:11,030
as lot of mineral content.
You can kind of see that in the pink,

171
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,720
that's the mineralization from it and so
a little bit more mineralization and a 

172
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,860
more pristine deposit so.
And it tastes better too.

173
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,560
Once you start using it,
it doesn't have that sharp bite.

174
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Salt has a real bite to it.
This just has the flavor of salt so you 

175
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,830
can actually use a little bit more salt.
Do you use it when you grill?

176
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,290
I do,
so I use kosher salt.

177
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,900
That's what I've always used for 
grilling.

178
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:35,790
We better really formula though.
I know what I'm doing now.

179
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,020
Just sobbing.
I'm I tried out this week now.

180
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,090
What about killer bee honey?
I don't.

181
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,760
Is that any better than regular honey or
is it just bad ass?

182
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,820
It's just bad.
Just how do they get this killer bees to

183
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,320
deposit this honey?
I mean,

184
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,300
isn't it dangerous to farm those 
fuckers?

185
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,770
There'd be pimp,
hand strong.

186
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,010
Wow.
They

187
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,250
just keep them high when they're blowing
smoke.

188
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,970
That's not weed,
but it should be.

189
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,430
Wouldn't it be cool if.
I mean,

190
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,640
I think it's just smoke,
right?

191
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,280
The idea is the smoke confuses them and 
calms them down.

192
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,330
So why wouldn't you use wheats monk?
I wonder if that would affect your 

193
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,401
relationship with the bees.
I fall sudden the hive got super 

194
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:16,180
creative and harmony and you could 
control them and shit.

195
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,460
Making art project.
Maybe they stopped working for the Queen

196
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:25,461
and the whole thing we get fucked.
They would realize that I doing with 

197
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,150
this queen bee is a cunt.
If they would realize like the queen bee

198
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,570
is the only be that can sting you and 
not die.

199
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,810
Do you know why?
Because she uses that Stinger to murder 

200
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,360
baby females.
That's why lemonade and competent,

201
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:42,120
she uses that Stinger and most of the 
babies that die in the,

202
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:47,121
in the hive,
they die from wounds from the side wall 

203
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,630
while the,
uh,

204
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:52,440
the female walks around a realizes 
there's a female grown in there.

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
So she pulls out a tap in Paris Stinger 
and just starts fucking up that baby 

206
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,090
while its in the Walton the hive.
So think about that.

207
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:04,530
Vegans.
Vegans will need hunting strict vegans.

208
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,390
That's silly.
Now you said it is man,

209
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,510
but who are we?
Who are reading meet these bees work for

210
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:14,511
us man.
He's one of the things we were talking 

211
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,240
about before the podcast and it's 
fucking so legit.

212
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:20,241
I'm drinking this starbucks coffee and 
man is it tastes like shit compared to 

213
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,740
bulletproof coffee and I really do.
That is a mycotoxins.

214
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:26,730
Ladies and gentlemen is something that I
got alerted to by Dave asprey,

215
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Dave asprey of bulletproof exec.com.
Fascinating guy with a lot of knowledge 

216
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:38,481
when it comes to health and wellness and
a optimum living and he sells this stuff

217
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:45,171
called bulletproof coffee and what it is
is coffee from a single source that is 

218
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:49,881
cultivated and maintained to be mold 
free and you're like what do you mean 

219
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:49,881
mold free?

220
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:54,860
Yeah.
That's something I didn't know about 

221
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,051
either.
Most coffee that you buy has mold on it 

222
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:59,370
and you know,
I'm tasting this right now and it tastes

223
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:04,371
pretty fucking shitty in comparison to 
this bulletproof coffee because last 

224
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:08,280
week I stopped drinking any regular 
coffee and just went 100 per 100 percent

225
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:13,281
bulletproof and the mycotoxins like 
really can affect you.

226
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:18,801
They affect your stomach,
they affect the way you feel after you 

227
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,440
drink coffee.
Crash.

228
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,700
Yeah.
Fresh.

229
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,060
It's like it adds on.
It compels from the caffeine is going to

230
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:27,120
leave your system.
But the way that coffee has that kind of

231
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,360
savage crashed,
it feels like that's from the toxins.

232
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,060
Yeah.
I different coffee.

233
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:33,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

234
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,690
I feel very different.
That's really fucking disturbing to me 

235
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,450
that starbucks is essentially selling 
poison.

236
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,990
Who Don't sue me?
I'm just allegedly allegedly.

237
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,860
Why?
Listen to me.

238
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:44,400
What do I know?

239
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,670
I told you at the beginning,
I'm going to tell you a lot of false 

240
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,670
shit,
but uh,

241
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,850
I would like to get it tested.
I mean,

242
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:51,000
we,
maybe we could do that.

243
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,210
Can we test our marks?
Can we go to like we probably get sued 

244
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:56,210
if we did that.
We just didn't use her name.

245
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,190
We said we went to Dave's doing that 
already.

246
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,320
Yes,
it's coming out.

247
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:04,321
We're actually,
he's comparing performance monitors for 

248
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:05,330
both bulletproof and for starbucks,
so hopefully we'll get there.

249
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:08,700
How do you do that?
By a double blind placebo.

250
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Someone's drinking bulletproof.
Someone's drinking regular and I'm 

251
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,350
testing some things.
I don't think it's a double blind.

252
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:19,351
I think it's more of like an open ended 
single arm research and doing something 

253
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:19,540
like that.
Is You gonna name?

254
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,130
Starbucks coffee bean.
I said Shit.

255
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,920
Yeah.
That's where it gets troublesome.

256
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,180
Those fuckers,
they'll come after you,

257
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,550
but it would be nice if they didn't sell
coffee.

258
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,440
That was fucking bad for you.
You know,

259
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,390
I,
I didn't really know.

260
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,700
A lot of people when you drink coffee 
and you feel like shit,

261
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,310
you don't really understand what's going
on,

262
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:41,311
but you are drinking poisonous fungus.
It sounds ridiculous and it sounds like 

263
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:44,720
you wouldn't be hearing about that from 
the fear factor guy feel like that would

264
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,740
be some shit that would be in the news.
That'd be some shit because so many 

265
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,701
people go to starbucks.
That'd be some shit that we would know 

266
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:53,701
about.
It is,

267
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:54,340
it's,
it's a,

268
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,850
it's real.
And uh,

269
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,940
this,
this thing exists,

270
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:02,941
not just in coffee but also in corn.
I've been researching mycotoxins online 

271
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,300
after having that conversation with 
them,

272
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,180
some disturbing shit.
Um,

273
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,360
but if you try out bulletproof coffee,
are we still selling it cheaper than 

274
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,800
Dave asprey has,
is the same price.

275
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,210
No,
he didn't like that though.

276
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,510
You're selling cheaper than him,
but it's fantastic coffee and I swear to

277
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:24,871
you,
it is different in its effect on your 

278
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,500
body and you really need to try it to,
to understand what the fuck is going on.

279
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,300
A stuff's not cheap,
but if you could find some other version

280
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:34,690
where you can be sure that it's a 
microbe free,

281
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,510
I suggest go with that.
Then do whatever you can,

282
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:42,511
but get that shit out of your life like,
I'm not going to finish this because it 

283
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:43,540
tastes fucking nasty.
Now I got a Venti starbucks.

284
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,780
I'm not going to finish it.
And that's how much an effect the 

285
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,631
bulletproof coffee.
What Dave's formula for bulletproof 

286
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,631
coffee is really fucking interesting and
what it is is coffee and then he takes 

287
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:59,371
mct oil and mct oil is also something 
that we sell it on it and mct oil is 

288
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,991
coconut oil that gets thrown through a 
centrifuge and it gets spun around like 

289
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:07,951
wicked fast and they take it,
isolates the most nutritious aspect of 

290
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:07,951
it.

291
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:11,460
And then they take that out and then he 
adds this mct oil to the coffee along 

292
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,000
with grass fed butter.
And you blend that bitch,

293
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,180
check it out,
throw a scoop of hemp force in there.

294
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,490
Go licious.
Delicious.

295
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,890
That is the secret.
The secret.

296
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,800
I'll remark as powerful move.
That's one scoop.

297
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,480
Try that.
About 12 grams.

298
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:26,390
Yeah.
Oh,

299
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:29,530
that sounds good.
And throw it in a blender.

300
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,780
You want to make sure your blender is 
tight though.

301
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,310
[inaudible].
I had one of them,

302
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:34,160
uh,
uh,

303
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,240
old school blenders and I tried to make 
bulletproof coffee and fucking shot off 

304
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,170
the top and it was a mess.
The counter is a mess,

305
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,390
but there's a Blendtec blenders can 
handle it.

306
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,350
Um,
and,

307
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:49,351
and,
and you mix it all together and the 

308
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:51,841
coffee is sensation that it's really 
like some of the best tasting shit 

309
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:52,280
you'll ever had in your life.
It's delicious.

310
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,020
It's like warm and it's like it's creamy
because it's got the grass fed butter in

311
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,430
it and oh,
it's really,

312
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,540
really good and I'm telling you will,
you will have a different effect and how

313
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,650
the caffeine and how uh,
how your body feels a after the coffee.

314
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,710
There's no big major crash like you'd 
get with regular shit.

315
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,980
And uh,
I'm really interested to see what Dave 

316
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,591
asprey's results are because I tend to 
think that we're going to realize in a 

317
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,680
couple of years from now,
like,

318
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:23,681
Holy Fuck,
we've been poisoning ourselves with 

319
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:23,681
fungus.

320
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,410
I used to think a coffee and I think you
had somebody mentioned it to you,

321
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:30,411
but it was almost like a hard drug at 
that point was you're going to take 

322
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,781
coffee,
you know that there's going to be a 

323
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:35,271
consequence down the.
But now you can drink it and I feel 

324
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:35,271
consequence free.
It feels like,

325
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:35,271
okay,

326
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:35,590
okay.
Yeah,

327
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:36,640
sure.
I'll have some coffee.

328
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,210
No big deal.
As energetic as I did during the peak.

329
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,250
Yeah,
but I don't have that.

330
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,390
It's smoother,
goes on smoother and leaves me there.

331
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,680
I haven't had coffee before.
That makes me want to fall asleep.

332
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,510
Like you have a company like,
oh,

333
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,240
I just need to take a nap.
Just totally yawning and nodding out.

334
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,860
You're like,
what the fuck is in that coffee?

335
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,940
Poisoned fish.
Um,

336
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,240
what else?
Oh,

337
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:03,241
on its selling its own coconut oil now 
labeled coconut oil that just got to my 

338
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:04,870
house.
I'm like,

339
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:06,380
this is ridiculous.
Yeah.

340
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,470
So what we're doing here is it seems 
like we're adding a lot of these random 

341
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,831
things.
Basically what we're trying to do is 

342
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:16,601
we're trying to create a comprehensive 
program that can help people on the 

343
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,510
supplement side,
on the fitness side,

344
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,660
and give them some key staple foods.
They can replace some of their other 

345
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,710
poorer quality foods with like the salt,
like the coffee,

346
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:29,711
like the raw honey.
And the key about the killer bee honey 

347
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,271
is it is raw and the way that you digest
that with the natural enzymes included 

348
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:34,070
in the minerals way better for you than 
process cooked honey.

349
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,280
So all of these different food sources 
allow you to replace some other crap 

350
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,241
that you have.
Tonka bars are natural buffalo and 

351
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:43,241
cranberry bars,
you know,

352
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,560
take those and throw out your slim Jims 
or whatever else you're snacking on.

353
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:47,120
It's just going to be a better 
alternative.

354
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,300
So that way on the food side,
we know we're not going to have every 

355
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,300
food,
your staple diet,

356
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,730
you're still gonna have to go out,
eat nutritious,

357
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,980
drink your Kale shakes,
do whatever you can,

358
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,220
but on some of the staples and some of 
the additives that you're normally 

359
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,581
putting in your diet,
we're helping to provide a better 

360
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:06,641
alternative for that.
And then of course on the supplement 

361
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:06,641
side,
we've all talked about that a lot,

362
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:10,871
but trying to create high performance,
highly densely packed nutritional 

363
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,530
supplements around a certain issue,
you know,

364
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,830
brain mood,
sports,

365
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,890
um,
whatever we can think of that we can 

366
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:20,890
pack together as many,
you know,

367
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,460
powerful ingredients in one formula and,
and provide that and next coming up,

368
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,730
which is still a little top secret.
We haven't released the details,

369
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:29,580
but we have our,
uh,

370
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,150
testosterone and performance supplement 
coming up,

371
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,890
which I'm really stoked about.

372
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,420
A lot of people think that testosterone 
supplements are bullshit and the reason 

373
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,020
why they think that is because most of 
them are bullshit.

374
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,560
But there are some things that can boost
your testosterone naturally.

375
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:45,490
Yeah.
And uh,

376
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,820
the beautiful Zma as one of them.
The beautiful thing about accompany,

377
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,450
like on it is you own the company so you
don't work for anybody.

378
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:58,080
So you can stock the store with cool 
shit.

379
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,220
You don't have to like get it approved.
You know,

380
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,290
like I've had conversations with you,
like the blender conversation.

381
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,620
We had a conversation today,
man,

382
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:06,840
man,
we should carry blenders.

383
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:07,920
Fuck out.
It's Carrie blenders,

384
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,180
boom.
What Carrie and blenders,

385
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I mean it's really that easy.
I'm one of the things we talked about 

386
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,150
that we haven't done anything about yet,
but we're talking about.

387
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,240
We're talking about an on it hunting 
ranch.

388
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We're talking about it and we're also 
talking about we could start selling 

389
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,870
that meat,
frozen grass fed meat,

390
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,050
frozen grassfed,
venison and selling it to people.

391
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,430
The idea being that if you eat meat and 
I eat a lot of meat,

392
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I want to be responsible at least 
somewhat for how that animal lives and 

393
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,580
if we decide to start selling grassfed 
venison,

394
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,880
there's a couple different ways to do it
and one of them is if you have a high 

395
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
fence operation,
which is in Texas,

396
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:55,650
they have a lot of branches now.

397
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Thousands and thousands of acres.
They put a big fence around it and 

398
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,680
there's deer that live inside there and 
you.

399
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,840
You basically set up tree stands,
you wait for one to catch up,

400
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:05,370
slipping,
and you blast them.

401
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,410
Well,
once you do that,

402
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,750
you can do whatever you want with that 
meat.

403
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:14,751
You can eat that meat or you could sell 
it online if we set up a place like that

404
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:18,030
where we can take people on their first 
hunting adventure,

405
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,120
like literally like bring people to a 
place where you'll allow them to kill 

406
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:26,640
their own meat and doing it in a humane 
and safe way,

407
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,020
but do it also in a way where you're 
relatively insured of success,

408
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,350
but this animal is living a complete 
natural life before you come along and 

409
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,460
pop a cap in his ass.

410
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Yeah,
being directly hands on with your food 

411
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,400
source,
knowing what it's eating,

412
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,870
knowing what you're eating and being 
playing a role in that.

413
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:51,871
I mean,
that's a part of the birthright of 

414
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:51,871
humanity.
Not only is it good for your health,

415
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:52,490
it's going to be,
I think,

416
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,600
important for your spirit if you're 
eating meat that somebody else's killing

417
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,210
your whole life without actually going 
through the process.

418
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,650
Something a little weird about that.

419
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,690
Yeah.
And there's a lot of people have a 

420
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,150
disconnect from their food and uh,
the idea is that if you,

421
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:13,040
if we had a place where you could go and
it would have to be very large,

422
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,220
large enough where it doesn't feel like 
you're shooting deer in the backyard 

423
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,150
because that's the big knock on these 
high fence operations.

424
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:22,310
It's canned hunting.
Um,

425
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,340
but really what it is,
is like if it's a large enough piece of 

426
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,791
property management,
you're managing the population of the 

427
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,660
animals and your manager from other 
people.

428
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:33,370
Yeah.
You procure,

429
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,370
you're procuring food and you're 
essentially like,

430
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,430
you're harvesting these animals in a way
way different than farming.

431
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:42,950
Like if we started our own grass fed 
cattle operation,

432
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,870
that will be cool.
But you know,

433
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,420
what you're doing is basically like,
and you're setting

434
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,430
these animals up to die and they walk 
around eating grass and you come along 

435
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,621
and you choose when to kill one.
This is it like that more than it is 

436
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,620
like wild hunting because you know that 
the,

437
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:01,600
there is no mystery as to whether there.
It's like a stock pond.

438
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,630
They're there.
So it's just about going out there and 

439
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,630
getting them in a completely natural 
way,

440
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,801
but before you come along and get them,
that animal is doing what it would do 

441
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,040
in,
you know,

442
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,170
a hundred years ago,
a thousand years ago,

443
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:16,510
2000 years ago.
It's living a natural life.

444
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,240
It's just living in a natural and it's 
going to have to do with predators.

445
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,060
I mean if you have a large piece of land
like that,

446
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,330
you have mountain lions period.
You have wild pigs period.

447
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
And both of those eat babies,
believe it or not,

448
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:30,940
coyotes,
they eat baby pigs or a baby deer.

449
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,230
So they deal with probation.
It's really a,

450
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,050
a,
a contained ecosystem.

451
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,690
And so we're talking about that.
That's the preliminary stages,

452
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,180
but I think that's the future pitches 
can be big.

453
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,270
We're bringing you crazy shit.

fitness equipment because we sell that 

456
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:55,621
shit is cheap as is humanly possible to 
send kettle bells and battle ropes and 

457
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:57,260
shit like that through the mail.
Um,

458
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,520
extreme kettlebell cardio DVD.
That's one of the,

459
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,590
uh,
the workouts that we've been carrying as

460
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,250
well.
And we're eventually gonna.

461
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,500
Make our own DVD.
Yeah.

462
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,670
Because big.
Yeah,

463
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,480
we need to do that.
But this,

464
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,570
this one right now is excellent.
I use it.

465

Cue The music.

468
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,550
Okay.

469
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,720
The Joe Rogan experience

470
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,100
Joe Rogan podcast

471
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,400
one day Roy Mcdonald is to ask me,
man,

472
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:38,401
why is my voice off fucking distorted?
How come you let Nick Diaz talking his 

473
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:39,670
regular voice?
We fucked my voice up sideways.

474
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:40,030
Son

475
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,570
[inaudible].
Why do you do that to him?

476
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,890
Good.
I'm trying to hurt his feelings.

477
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,140
Whoa.
I can't believe you went there.

478
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,290
I can't even believe you went there.
And good luck.

479
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,090
So what's up buddy?
What's going on,

480
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,020
Bro?
Yeah man.

481
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,430
It's always good.
The weird thing,

482
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,020
the pause,
the commercial,

483
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,770
the commercial and then the music and 
then they start talking part.

484
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,410
Yeah.
That's the most efficient way to do it.

485
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,150
So that's why

486
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,580
everything's been good,
man.

487
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,320
It's been a.
it's been a hell of a run Exxon.

488
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,350
It's been super exciting.
I've been really exploring some of the 

489
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,430
more non psychedelic adventures in my 
own life.

490
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:16,200
That had been pretty,
pretty cool.

491
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,230
Some of those things.
Well I guess you'd say non plant based 

492
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,420
experience is really focusing on 
deepening meditation.

493
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Learned a really cool thing called 
shamonic breathing,

494
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,630
which I was totally skeptical about.
Have you ever heard about that?

495
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:31,860
Now what is that?
All right.

496
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:36,861
So basically what you do is you create 
these really powerful breaths and 

497
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:41,390
consecutively through notes like that.
So you're hyperventilating and you have 

498
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:45,410
it's best to do this with a guide 
because I didn't really know what expect

499
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,520
going through.
I was just like,

500
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:47,150
alright,
whatever.

501
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,790
They put on some music and they get you 
fired up and they're like,

502
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:50,600
give it hell.
Do it.

503
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Like you're fighting for something great
in your life and they get you kind of 

504
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,210
stoked on this and you start breathing 
and what you're trying to do actually is

505
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:02,220
create a state where you're,
you know,

506
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,850
you're purposefully hyperventilating 
yourself,

507
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:09,851
which is actually manipulating your Ph 
and then constricting some of the blood 

508
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,600
vessels that go to your go to your 
brain.

509
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,970
So you're creating choking yourself.
Yeah,

510
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,030
little bit,
a little bit out of her erotic fiction a

511
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:22,031
little bit.
So what you're trying to do is like 

512
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:24,671
Aldous Huxley would say,
is you're trying to obscure the 

513
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,000
cognitive filter for long enough that 
your brain allows little gaps.

514
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:31,001
It's like opening the blinds in your 
brain a little bit so that the rational 

515
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:34,181
mind goes away and it allows whatever 
else that is even pressfield would call 

516
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,030
it the muse,
you know,

517
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,850
psychedelic people would call it source 
or the other,

518
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,020
whatever you want to call it.

519
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,020
That other information that comes in 
that isn't quite just produced by 

520
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,950
irrational mind.
And by shutting off a few of the valves,

521
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,800
it's actually kind of.
It feels like you're opening the blinds.

522
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,850
Well,
again,

523
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:54,851
I was totally skeptical.
I've obviously done some of the most 

524
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:55,670
significant plant medicines in the 
world,

525
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,840
so I was like,
what is this shit?

526
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,870
This is just breathing.
But I got into it and the first thing 

527
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,190
that happens about 10 minutes in as you 
experienced what's called tetany,

528
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:09,191
they call it and that's where you like 
get really kind of curled up and you 

529
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:09,191
feel like you're,
you're,

530
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
you have like the claw,
like you can't stretch out your fingers.

531
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,730
Super uncomfortable position with.
They're like,

532
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:14,930
keep breathing,
keep breathing.

533
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,920
And I was like,
fuck it.

534
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:16,960
I'll go through it,
you know,

535
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:22,030
I'll,
I'll see what's at the end of this 

536
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,040
rabbit hole.
And then I did and I pushed through that

537
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:27,041
state and about 15 minutes in it turned 
full psychedelic experience and it was 

538
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:28,850
awesome.

539
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,300
It was cool as shit in 15 minutes then 
15 minutes or just heavy crazy bravery,

540
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,950
creativity and you,
you like,

541
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:41,951
how long do these breaths there fast?
Give me a couple of giving up on right 

542
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:46,160
now and just keep doing that for 15 
minutes and you can alternate it.

543
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,460
You can alternate doing like little 
short ones like you know,

544
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,910
but basically putting out a massive 
amount of breath and then it's also,

545
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,090
it's best to do this with somebody 
they're leading because it does create,

546
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,700
you get really kind of a.
it's a weird state.

547
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,701
You're being,
you're actually really generating a 

548
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:07,910
psychedelic state so we get in there 15 
minutes and it was cool.

549
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:12,911
It's not like the dmt experience which 
has this what they call the 

550
00:26:12,911 --> 00:26:16,331
chrysanthemum have all these colors and 
for Texas and lights and the flotillas 

551
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:17,000
then I'll all the shit I've previously 
described,

552
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,400
but it's very focused like the vision 
that you get.

553
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,620
And I had a whole,
me personally,

554
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,290
I had like a whole background that kind 
of came in.

555
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,230
It was kind of like a seamless eternal 
background.

556
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:32,231
Three hundred and 60 degrees and then I 
saw myself come in but I was like 

557
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:34,140
faceless and I was looking and let your 
eyes open or closed.

558
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:35,180
Closed.
Closed.

559
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,230
Yeah.
You can't really see.

560
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,870
If you try to open your vision,
you're a little dizzy,

561
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,990
you're distorted.
You've basically hyperventilated the 

562
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:43,990
shit out of yourself.
So.

563
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,510
So when your eyes closed and you're 
seeing this,

564
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,170
and then the most powerful,
transformative moment for me was when I 

565
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,470
actually,
for the first time,

566
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:57,471
out of all the medicines I've ever done,
I saw a visual depiction of what I 

567
00:26:57,471 --> 00:26:59,610
believe my God self,
my soul,

568
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,620
my spirit self was,
you know,

569
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,920
in the Boga experience.
That was my true self.

570
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,520
And I heard it talking to me while I was
taking the above at.

571
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,520
That was the one guiding me through with
a blinking cursor going through all the 

572
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,230
information in my life.
That voice,

573
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,580
I actually saw it pictured and depicted 
in the physical form.

574
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,080
In that vision,
did it look like it didn't,

575
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,310
is that safe for your lungs or your 
brand?

576
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,210
So it was developed by a,
by this Guy Stanislav Grof.

577
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:29,670
And he developed it when acid became 
illegal,

578
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,400
he's like,
we got to create a state that's legal.

579
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,830
Now that acid is illegal because that 
was his favorite.

580
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,890
So He created this and they've done 
quite a bit of study.

581
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,870
Um,
it felt,

582
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,880
it felt,
you know,

583
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,130
intense,
but you felt really strong and good 

584
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,320
after it was done.
So.

585
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:51,321
And I've looked around at some of the 
studies and a couple of people say it's 

586
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,141
not good for you,
but other people say absolutely no harm 

587
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:54,990
and done.
So do your research on that.

588
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:57,720
Make sure that you're comfortable with 
what it's doing to your body

589
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,990
about the idea.
Why would I.

590
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,840
I'm confused as to why it would be bad 
for you while you're doing this.

591
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:03,950
Breathing heavy.
But yeah,

592
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,250
it really,
you're not adding any kind of size.

593
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,810
The same kind of thing is it is to a 
certain degree,

594
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:12,830
except this is actually temporarily 
restricting some blood flow.

595
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:14,600
But it's not like,
how is it doing that though,

596
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:15,560
by just breathing?
Yeah.

597
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:19,080
So some mechanism with the Russian.
Yeah.

598
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,620
You're going to have to faster,
harder in through the nose,

599
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:29,621
out through the mouth.
This does not make for a good podcast 

600
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:31,880
because this could take like 10 minutes.
I could take a while,

601
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,050
especially for dropped down to five,
but uh,

602
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,650
but it manipulates the carbon dioxide 
level in your blood.

603
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,740
You're expelling more carbon dioxide,
which raises your Ph level.

604
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,920
And by raising your

605
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,240
Ph level,
it's somehow restricts some of the blood

606
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:49,870
vessels which creates this state.
And uh,

607
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,790
and really there's,
you know,

608
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,760
when you start to look at the mechanism 
of action,

609
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:57,761
a lot of psychedelics,
what it's doing is it's shutting off 

610
00:28:57,761 --> 00:28:59,290
certain portions of the brain and that's
what people know.

611
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,750
That's where I really appreciate Aldous 
Huxley's view on this,

612
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:07,751
which is a lot of people think the 
psychedelic experience is adding 

613
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:08,420
something to you.
Like adding an experience on.

614
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,610
He's saying all you're doing,
you're not adding shit.

615
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,730
You're taking away your mind and by 
taking away your mind you allow what's 

616
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,231
already there to come through.
And this is a reliable legal self 

617
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:22,070
mechanism for getting there.

618
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,460
And it was pretty cool.
So I have to say,

619
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,390
where does the average person find a 
guide to do this?

620
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,310
Yeah.
I would just look at Google,

621
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,430
your city,
whatever it is all fucked up.

622
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,940
You got to be careful guys.
Gonna fuck you is gonna.

623
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,080
Yes.
Shamonic breathing.

624
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:40,750
You've got to breathe through my day.
You have to be careful wherever you go.

625
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:42,610
You have.
Be careful with Iowasca Maestros.

626
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:45,340
You have to be careful with a bogus 
shamans.

627
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,610
All of these people.
It's true.

628
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,030
Put them through your shit last.

629
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,890
No,
you never know because just because 

630
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,601
someone says they're in a bogus shaman 
doesn't mean anybody could say that now.

631
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,860
I mean anybody could say they're in 
Iowasca Arrow.

632
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,440
You have to find out whether that's 
unfortunate.

633
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,960
That's one of the unfortunate aspects of
being able to communicate.

634
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:06,980
We can also lie.

635
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,250
It's like a life coach and we're going 
to say that they're a life coach now.

636
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,590
That's ridiculous.
She's got a funny life coach story that 

637
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,590
they tell you.

638
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,490
That guy who bangs older rich chicks.
No,

639
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,370
I did.
I mentioned him on the podcast before,

640
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:23,270
but it's like when you're around someone
and you just immediately go,

641
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,670
oh great,
there's a fucking.

642
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,850
There was a coyote in the chicken coop 
and I'm watching all these poor old 

643
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,641
ladies hang around with this,
like super charming man with a ponytail 

644
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:34,310
and I want to smack them because I'm 
like,

645
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,160
I know what you're doing.
You fuck.

646
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,240
And he's hanging out with these older 
broads and he started out as like a 

647
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,650
manny,
you know,

648
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,950
a male nanny.
And my friend who lived next door,

649
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,940
I was like,
that fucking guy away from my wife,

650
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:47,620
man.
Like he,

651
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:50,090
like he had a thing about him and this 
guy's not very jealous.

652
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,200
So I was like,
hmm,

653
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:56,201
interesting.
So then it turns out he starts banging 

654
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:56,600
the wife and they get a divorce.
And so

655
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,110
the husband knew it,
the husband leaves,

656
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,080
now this guy is banging the wife who's 
rich of course.

657
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,970
And now he becomes a life coach.
He's not a male nanny anymore,

658
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:09,410
he's a life coach.
And I'm like,

659
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:14,411
this guy is just a straight con man.
He's just a straight con man who moved 

660
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:16,280
into this neighborhood and started 
wearing thumb rings,

661
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,520
knee high leather boots,
and the ponytail,

662
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:21,060
you know,
tries to,

663
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,690
can only permit yourself one or the 
other.

664
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:24,710
Really?
Yeah.

665
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:25,220
He's one of those

666
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,110
sky's where,
you know,

667
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,630
you'll catch him reading a classic.
Oh,

668
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,060
it just happened to be reading Kerouac 
here.

669
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,520
Come on in.
You know,

670
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,070
he's like cultivating this whole image 
and using it to scam these older ladies.

671
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,230
It's really interesting how obvious it 
is to like,

672
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:42,030
who's she talking to?
The Guy,

673
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:44,920
he just oozes bullshit.
Button bodies.

674
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:47,240
Thirty six and he's got a cock and you 
know,

675
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,280
these 50 year old women,
I can't believe he's banging me and 

676
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,280
boom,
next thing you know,

677
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,090
he's a life coach.
Life fucking life coach.

678
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,790
Got to get your bolt.
Bullshit detector out.

679
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,430
If I'm strong,
hone that in.

680
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,810
And ladies,
guys with thumb rings.

681
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,810
Come on now.
Come on now.

682
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,020
What is that guy doing with a fucking 
thumb ring on?

683
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,410
Silly Bitch.
That's ridiculous.

684
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,620
Agreed.
Agreed.

685
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,710
He's banging you.
You're 50 and he's got a thumb ring.

686
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:15,510
Rod,

687
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,720
ponytail.
Run.

688
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:19,100
Yeah,
ponytail.

689
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,540
That Paul Rudd movie about Elysium.
And what was that one about?

690
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:28,541
What?
There's this Paul Rudd movie that was 

691
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,551
kind of a bit of a spoof on a,
on like a commune where everything was 

692
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:36,161
super spiritual guy,
but I saw the ads for the last 

693
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:37,260
wanderlust is the name of it.
Yeah,

694
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,960
main guy.
It was pretty funny.

695
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,070
Yeah,
there's some super funny

696
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,310
part was that movie vanished.
I didn't have a fucking God damn.

697
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,570
It wasn't.
It wasn't great,

698
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,910
but it was okay,
but they have a guy like that ponytail,

699
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,790
thumb rings,
plays the guitar really soft,

700
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,710
and then he ends up trying to fuck 
polaroids girlfriend

701
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,620
course.
Of course.

702
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,680
That's what those guys do.
I know another guy who will remain,

703
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:00,710
remain nameless police,
very shamanistic in nature and really 

704
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,140
trying to just bank chicks,
but there are good ones.

705
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,360
There are good ones.
Well for sure.

706
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,230
The experience is,
you know,

707
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:12,290
I had a conversation with David Cho 
about this yesterday where I said that 

708
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,310
if you took dmt or silicide been or 
whatever and someone said to you,

709
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,090
did you just go to [inaudible] dot com 
and we're gonna get off,

710
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,440
get off that.
Look at these messages.

711
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,850
I don't want to see the messages,
man.

712
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,150
If you,
you know,

713
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:30,840
a lot of people like look at any sort of
a psychedelic experience and they say,

714
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,490
Oh,
you're hallucinating,

715
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,510
you're just hallucinating.
But my take on it is kind of whether or 

716
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,870
not it's real.
Whether or not you could take it and put

717
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:44,871
it in a bag and put a zip lock on it and
set it on a scale and measure it your or

718
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,050
whether or not it's illumination.

719
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,100
The exact same experience happened.
Whether you think that you are in 

720
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,571
another dimension communicating with 
intelligent entities or these chemicals 

721
00:33:56,571 --> 00:34:01,461
are fucking with your cerebral cortex 
and forcing your visual input to get 

722
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:04,860
fuck sideways by all this additional 
shit that's not supposed to be there and

723
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:07,530
so you have hallucinations.
Either way,

724
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,040
the same thing is happening to you.
If you took magic fairy dust and were 

725
00:34:13,141 --> 00:34:18,141
transported into an impossible,
strange land where the sky was filled 

726
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:22,641
with everchanging geometric patterns 
that are made out of love and 

727
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:26,211
understanding and they're coming down to
you and telling you everything that you 

728
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:29,271
already know about yourself and telling 
you that they love you or you're 

729
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:31,650
hallucinating.
Isn't in the same thing happening.

730
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,220
The same thing is happening to your 
eyes.

731
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,670
The same thing is happening to your 
brain and the same thing is happening.

732
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:43,671
For you to sit back and to sort of 
interpret and try to incorporate into 

733
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:47,010
your view of the world,
the same exact thing,

734
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:52,250
whether it's real or not,
so we get caught up in this idea of 

735
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,000
what's real,
what is real?

736
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,030
Is that real?
Because I can hit it with a hammer and 

737
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,100
is the air real because I can't even 
touch that.

738
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,520
It's like,
can we measure it with modern sources?

739
00:35:02,521 --> 00:35:03,930
If we can,
then it's real.

740
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,550
I say,
that's crazy.

741
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,800
Yeah,
I agree and you know the.

742
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:11,801
I've been looking at a lot of toltec 
philosophy over recently and they just 

743
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:16,140
dispose of that problem entirely.
They call our whole experience the dream

744
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,840
and it's a.
it's a cocreated dream by everybody.

745
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:23,841
They just call it the dream.
The total is what they call it and what 

746
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:25,290
they say is the most important thing is 
not the dream itself,

747
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:29,640
but how that dream interacts with us.
It's a completely subjective reality.

748
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,860
If you already think of everything as a 
dream,

749
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,950
then you stop asking these silly 
questions about whether the mushrooms 

750
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,410
are doing this so that it's about your 
experience them.

751
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,560
It's about how that translates to what 
you're going to be,

752
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,650
how you're able to see the world better,
how you're able to find a deeper 

753
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,461
awareness,
how you're able to in what their 

754
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:52,160
worldview is.
Be the warrior hunter that hunts what 

755
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,770
they call the parasite inside 
themselves.

756
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,110
Same thing that Steven pressfield calls 
resistance.

757
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,290
They call the parasite hunt.
That part of yourself that self 

758
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,741
sabotaging,
that's fearful and and that's what they 

759
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:06,891
say is the most important,
is getting yourself to those states 

760
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:08,490
where you're aware and you can interact 
with the dream on your terms,

761
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,580
set your intent,
use your powerful belief to make the 

762
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,720
dream a dream of heaven instead of a 
dream of hell,

763
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,980
and the idea that your gonna fall into 
some sort of a situation where if you 

764
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:29,130
have a psychedelic experience and it 
fucks your head up,

765
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:34,131
that maybe you're not going to be able 
to come back and maybe you're going to 

766
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:37,791
go crazy.
That that's a real possibility and 

767
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,521
that's something that people need to 
consider before they fuck around with 

768
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,791
anything.
If you have a hard time with regular 

769
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:43,791
reality,
don't,

770
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:47,901
don't go doing any drugs.
That's when you want to try that 

771
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:48,750
shamonic breathing shit.
Try to work your way up to that.

772
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,000
Totally.
Don't just take acid,

773
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,520
you know,
because if you take acid it will last 

774
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,240
like a long time and if you're freaking 
out,

775
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,570
like part of psychedelic experiences are
the ability to just let go and it's very

776
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:08,481
hard for people to do and one of the big
things when you hear people talk about 

777
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:09,210
like bad trips,
in my experience,

778
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,480
one of the big issues is people letting 
go and letting the experience take them 

779
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:20,241
there because you will try to resist it 
because one of the first things that any

780
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:25,251
psychedelic experience exposes is your 
own flaws and inadequacies and a lot of 

781
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:26,780
people

782
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,670
do not.
Yeah.

783
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,770
I think it was Bob Marley that said it 
was the mirror that reveals you to 

784
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:32,770
yourself.
Yeah.

785
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,850
A lot of people don't like that.
No,

786
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:39,550
because you're creating.
You're creating an image that isn't 

787
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,981
true.
Image you want to project is not what's 

788
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:42,320
going to appear to you in the mirror.
Unless you've done something like this,

789
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:43,790
doesn't have to be a psychedelic 
experience.

790
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,880
A flotation tank can get you that 
meditation,

791
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,680
if done correctly,
can get you there,

792
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,710
but the psychedelic experience goes with
the earth mover and it just takes tons 

793
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:59,201
of dirt off of the path.
So you see the mirror way quicker to 

794
00:37:59,201 --> 00:37:59,690
bunker buster.
It is exactly.

795
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:04,691
It's just gets right down through.
That fucks you up all your mountain of 

796
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:04,691
bullshit that you've covered yourself 
with

797
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:10,850
that.
That's what I think leads to a lot of 

798
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,881
bad trips for people.
But you also have to consider brain 

799
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:13,881
chemistry.
You know,

800
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,270
there's some people that need 
medication.

801
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,400
There's some people where their brain's 
not working so well.

802
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:22,730
And if that's,
you don't stack mushrooms on top of 

803
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,700
that.
I would say that that's probably not the

804
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,560
best way to go.
I think that's important.

805
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:30,561
Whenever we talk about psycho dogs,
we're talking about the good aspects of 

806
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:30,561
it.
But then you hear about like,

807
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,580
that dude from pink floyd that lost his 
marbles,

808
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:32,740
and

809
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,800
especially with the synthetics,
you know,

810
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,110
you'd that seemingly acid and some other
different,

811
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,930
um,
you know,

812
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,980
some of the other different Kenneth 
Chemical Monikers,

813
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:45,870
like a Dr Sasha shogun would create and 
his lab or something like that.

814
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,630
Seems fine though.
He is fine now,

815
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:51,110
but he has the right attitude.
I think with the right attitude of the,

816
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,740
the key is,
is to witness and allow.

817
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,380
You got to be the person in the movie 
theater,

818
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,690
eating popcorn,
watching what's happening,

819
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,450
you know,
kind of subjectively or objectively.

820
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,290
I mean,
just like,

821
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,490
oh,
that's interesting.

822
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,050
Oh,
snakes eating my organs.

823
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,920
Oh yeah,
that's interesting.

824
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:07,150
Oh,
going down a vine,

825
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:09,220
the thorns and having my genitals 
eviscerated.

826
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,270
Oh,
that's unpleasant.

827
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:15,271
But no big deal.
That's the attitude you have to take 

828
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:15,670
during those horrible things regardless 
of what it is.

829
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,440
Because if you don't,
if you try to fight it,

830
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,310
it's going to win.

831
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,880
Yeah.
And it's so easy to develop a strong ego

832
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,560
got.
Especially if you're a man,

833
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,770
it's so easy to take yourself seriously,
especially if you've got some 

834
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,771
accomplishments under your belt and 
you're working hard every day and you 

835
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:31,771
just start thinking you're something 
special,

836
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:36,760
you know,
you really can confuse the fuck out of 

837
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,431
yourself and then one of those ego 
obliterating experiences comes along and

838
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:43,510
just exposes you to yourself or what you
really are and you're like,

839
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,540
Oh wow,
who?

840
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,150
But I almost always feel when it's over,
like wow,

841
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,230
I needed that.
Yeah,

842
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,750
absolutely.
So much feel so much lighter.

843
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,860
Better now.
I can get along quicker now.

844
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

845
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,240
I think going back to the archives of my
history,

846
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:04,390
I remember one particularly difficult 
experience.

847
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,400
One of the most challenging I had,
and I've had A.

848
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:10,270
I've talked a lot about snakes and 
spiders exploding and all of that.

849
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,330
I've always taken with a grain of salt.
The one that was the most,

850
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,620
most challenging experience I've had was
actually a vision of hell,

851
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:22,650
where I felt completely out of any realm
where there was life.

852
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,170
Like there was not a rock,
there was not a tree,

853
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,090
there was not another living thing 
anywhere around and it was the deepest,

854
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,570
loneliest,
most isolated feeling I've ever felt.

855
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,690
And that to me actually calibrated what 
my experience of hell ever was,

856
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,180
is hell is not in these places with 
demons and fire.

857
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:48,181
There's all life force there.
There's the energy of creation and 

858
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:48,820
destruction.
Hell is being on the other side of space

859
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:53,770
where there is no life where there's no 
source where there's no nothing there.

860
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:55,570
I mean a rock,
a spider,

861
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:58,660
anything would have been a salvation in 
this place that I was,

862
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,900
that I was appearing at and I felt 
myself at that point trying to fight it 

863
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:03,900
like,
oh fuck,

864
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,150
I gotta get Outta here.

865
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,100
Make some butterflies,
appear something,

866
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:07,330
please happen.
A color,

867
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:12,331
anything.
Everything was just drab and dead and I 

868
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:13,360
was totally alone.
And that experience there,

869
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,220
you know,
if,

870
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:19,160
if I hadn't been well versed in,
in what you know,

871
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,980
in this realm,
on the other side,

872
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:25,981
then it could have been a really.
It could have been an experience that 

873
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:25,981
stuck with me.
You know?

874
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:30,721
It could have been something that I 
didn't allow to happen and I fought and 

875
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,721
I,
and if I would have stood up and tried 

876
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:33,770
to change my scenery and touch my face 
and say,

877
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:34,200
Hey,

878
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,120
I'm still alive.
Hey,

879
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,390
I'm still in life.
And not actually dealt with that and not

880
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,480
seen it all the way through.
I had the feeling like that would have 

881
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:43,480
been something that would have stuck 
with me.

882
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,590
So psychedelics are not to be taken 
lightly.

883
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,660
I think you need to take the proper 
steps.

884
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:49,640
Find someone who's experienced,
you know,

885
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:52,080
do something like holotropic breathing,
you know,

886
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,830
do something like an isolate all of 
trophic holotropic,

887
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:55,490
ours,
Germantic.

888
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,830
Do something like that.
Go to an isolation tank.

889
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,520
You know,
maybe we try a little weed,

890
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:01,780
you know,
make sure that you're cool with,

891
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,050
with like the baby steps before you just
go whole hog.

892
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:08,300
And if you do go whole hog,
there's something to be said for that.

893
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:11,600
Just diving in the cold swimming pool 
without dipping your toe in.

894
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,910
Make sure you're with someone who's just
on their game and really on point and 

895
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:16,910
can guide you through.

896
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:21,280
And you can look at them.
One of the most important things is to 

897
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,280
look at them and be like,
Hey,

898
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,770
I'm not going to die.
Right?

899
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,240
And sometimes you just need it to be 
like,

900
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:23,840
yeah,
you're good.

901
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,120
And that's all you need.
Like,

902
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Hey,
I didn't accidentally poison myself 

903
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,140
because your brain will tell you if 
you're doing it alone and you get to a 

904
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,140
bad place,
it's going to say,

905
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,620
I think you might've just boys and 
yourself,

906
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:34,640
dude,
you didn't mind it.

907
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,280
Just boys and yourself.
And you don't want that voice.

908
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,730
Especially when you're starting out.
That's what it feels like mean.

909
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:44,740
Do DMT.
You feel like there's no way I'm coming 

910
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:44,740
back.
Fucked up,

911
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,760
fucked up.
Yeah.

912
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,820
I crossed into the great beyond to take 
a peek and they're going to let me back.

913
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:55,610
It's.
It's really sad that from what we know 

914
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,030
about the positive benefits of a lot of 
these substances,

915
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,430
that we are forced to do it this way.

916
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,850
We're forced to.
We were under the illusion that we live 

917
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,450
in a free society because it's freer 
than most societies,

918
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,340
but it's still not a free society.
The human race has yet to conceive of an

919
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:18,341
execute a free society.
It doesn't exist as far especially a 

920
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:19,910
free,
educated,

921
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,940
aware society that is not beholden to 
evil corporations.

922
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,160
We haven't figured that out yet.
We really haven't,

923
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,520
and that's why we make movies about it,
like Avatar and they become wildly 

924
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,550
popular.
Oh yeah.

925
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,270
That's the closest we can come to is our
own imaginations.

926
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,300
He,
yeah,

927
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:40,020
there's some,
I don't know.

928
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:45,250
There's a lot of people believe that 
you're going to have to cert have a 

929
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,341
certain amount of Yang in order to have 
a certain amount of yen and it's almost 

930
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:52,091
like this sort of evil against good is 
like what the human being needs to sort 

931
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:56,810
of propel society forward.

932
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,230
Constant struggle and conflict,
which creates momentum.

933
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,650
I don't necessarily agree with that,
but it seems to be that a lot of people 

934
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,710
are lazy as fuck and if they lived in 
paradise,

935
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,170
they wouldn't get laptops made.
You know?

936
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,030
It's almost like you need some.
It's,

937
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,870
it all has to be difficult for us to 
push further,

938
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,330
you know,
but there's enough difficulty in our own

939
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:22,331
minds just getting within ourselves.
Finding happiness and self love and 

940
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,520
actualization is a fucking battle 
already,

941
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,030
so to say that we need this external 
shit just to allow us to do that is not 

942
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,500
true.
There's always gonna be a struggle.

943
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,040
I'm not saying

944
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,650
that we need you and I certainly don't 
need it,

945
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,160
but society as a whole,
if I looked at the human race as a 

946
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,731
mathematical computation and I looked at
the amount of energy that's been 

947
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:47,180
expressed and the amount of effort 
that's been expressed and a little,

948
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,710
why are they spending so much energy?
Why they're spending so much effort?

949
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:54,950
Well,
they're doing it because it's trying to 

950
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,950
conquer the world junior because of 
trying to expose.

951
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,400
They're trying to enforce the ape 
ideology on this ever changing 

952
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,620
technological world they live and that's
why they're expressing themselves in 

953
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,740
these 16 hour work days.
It's really that simple.

954
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,390
I mean why?
Why are they in debt?

955
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:08,010
Why they owe so much money?
Why do they,

956
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:13,011
why do they work more than their health,
let's them like what do they do in 

957
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:13,011
there?
Well,

958
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,040
they have to because they owe money.

959
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:19,070
Credit cards because they had to pay for
fucking electronics that they need to 

960
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,001
keep the machine alive.
Like if you looked at a completely 

961
00:45:23,001 --> 00:45:25,080
objective outside of being a person 
outside of being a cog in this wheel and

962
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:26,880
you looked at it from like,
you know,

963
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,590
an objective distance,
you'd would say,

964
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:33,591
oh,
I see they're fucking building towards 

965
00:45:33,591 --> 00:45:35,661
something and they're there in a fury.
They're in a frenzy to the point where 

966
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:39,381
they give up their own health and 
happiness in order to perpetuate this 

967
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:44,211
process.
They're either building something over 

968
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:45,120
there at the height of madness,
you know,

969
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:50,150
to a certain degree and could be that 
this height of madness.

970
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,190
The whole reason why it coexists with 
this incredible,

971
00:45:55,381 --> 00:46:00,381
restrict him restriction on psychedelics
and restriction on the public's access 

972
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:06,050
to psychedelics that they.
They coexist because without one you 

973
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,020
could not have the other.

974
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:12,150
If if psychedelics were not illegal and 
incredibly difficult to come by,

975
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:17,151
we would not live in the same world.
We would be connected with the whole 

976
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:17,520
world,
would realize that we are all.

977
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,760
We are completely necessary to each 
other and that that vision that you had 

978
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,661
of ultimate space and silence and no 
color and drabness and being being 

979
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:32,241
hellacious because even though we have 
these instincts in this ego that wants 

980
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:35,700
us to go out there and make our name for
ourselves,

981
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,670
the reality is you are not shit without 
other people.

982
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,210
You cannot you if you're alone.
It's for breaks.

983
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:47,570
We take breaks and you breathe and you 
get something to eat and watch tv by 

984
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:47,730
yourself and you go.
That was nice,

985
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,850
but you better get back to the people 
soon because if you don't,

986
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,410
you're fucked.
It's like I don't.

987
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:53,400
Some days I don't eat.

988
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,800
I take a day off eating.
If I feel like taking a day off,

989
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:56,480
eating,
it's good for you,

990
00:46:56,481 --> 00:47:00,090
but I don't take more than one.
You know I don't take a month off.

991
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,120
You know what I'm saying?
Like that's not good and a staple of 

992
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,160
being a human being is human beings.
You have to interact with human beings.

993
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:08,880
We're,
we're,

994
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,700
we're most certainly a part of a 
process.

995
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:16,110
The question is,
is this process being run in a conscious

996
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:21,111
manner or is it being run and 
instinctive manner that's been hijacked 

997
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
because the very instincts that we have,
which we're sort of regulated by 

998
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,710
psychedelic compounds throughout our 
history,

999
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,960
and we removed those compounds from the 
equation which accelerates the madness 

1000
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,641
aspect of the human without the bio 
chemical and botanical sort of mediating

1001
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:42,490
age that's unbalanced.

1002
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,510
I think a lot of things had been 
hijacked.

1003
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:47,270
I think religion has been one of the 
main things that has been hijacked.

1004
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:51,050
It is taken our desire to connect with 
source,

1005
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,160
with life,
with God.

1006
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,050
If your vocabulary permits,
you know,

1007
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,450
there's a big vocab issue,
this whole thing,

1008
00:47:56,451 --> 00:48:01,451
whatever you want to call it,
that force that creates life within all 

1009
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:01,451
of us,
call it God,

1010
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:03,530
call it whatever you want,
but there is a natural inclination that,

1011
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:05,660
drawing towards that,
I think there's a,

1012
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,500
there's an old myth between,
uh,

1013
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:10,160
a Hindu myth and it says,
you know,

1014
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,190
Brahma and Maya were the only two forces
out there in the universe and they were 

1015
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,850
bored.
And so mine.

1016
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,310
I said,
okay,

1017
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,020
we're going to create a game.
I was a female,

1018
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:23,021
Brahma is the male.
Dad would not let any of them have sex 

1019
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:26,021
at that point anyways,
but she says we're going to have a game 

1020
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:26,021
and the and is like,
okay,

1021
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:26,021
we'll do that.

1022
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:28,310
It's like first you create the world.
Brahma creates the world.

1023
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,680
Then after Brahma creates the world,
she says,

1024
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:35,681
okay,
now you have to create someone who can 

1025
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:35,681
appreciate the world and says,
okay,

1026
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:39,911
so he creates humans and then at that 
point she cuts them up into all tiny 

1027
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:43,580
little tiny pieces and he puts a little 
piece in each human and says,

1028
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:44,990
Brahma,
now the game begins.

1029
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:50,020
The game is you are going to all think 
you're different and you're going to 

1030
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,130
have to find your way back to figuring 
out who you are and so that,

1031
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:57,310
that idea that we're all like a little 
piece of something still just trying to 

1032
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:59,900
figure it out.
That instinct,

1033
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:01,310
that impetus to,
you know,

1034
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,760
to find what we are at the very core,
when you remove the body,

1035
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:08,150
remove the mind,
get back to the soul and even remove the

1036
00:49:08,151 --> 00:49:08,690
soul.

1037
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,780
So you're just that piece of life force.
You know that desire to figure out what 

1038
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,670
that is has been jacked just jacked by 
Christianity,

1039
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:17,870
Islam,
Judaism,

1040
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,800
which had as a sentiment of truth,
a kernel of goodness and wisdom.

1041
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:23,570
All of these things,
Islam included,

1042
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,120
everything has this kernel of wisdom and
value,

1043
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,430
but then it gets hijacked by people for 
power.

1044
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,900
You know,
people who have been frustrated,

1045
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:34,901
people who are sadistic,
people who want to control other people 

1046
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:34,901
want the money,
want the sex.

1047
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:37,130
They're like the Tony Montana in a 
fucking priest robe,

1048
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,400
you know,
they jack this stuff leaders to control 

1049
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,490
the people and and it's created this 
massive imbalance.

1050
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,750
I think it's maybe not created it,
but it certainly accelerated it and then

1051
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,780
of course the forces of greed that have 
been kind of a inculcated by general 

1052
00:49:53,901 --> 00:49:58,340
society and this feeling that you need 
more things and in all of this,

1053
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,970
this is all just fueled to create really
a massive imbalance.

1054
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:04,610
In my opinion.
It did need to be this massive,

1055
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,710
but there is going to be a massive 
correction.

1056
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,980
I just hope we don't go too far back the
other way because there is a need for 

1057
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,010
balance.
There is a need for,

1058
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,150
you know,
in my opinion,

1059
00:50:14,151 --> 00:50:18,620
strength and capitalism and many of the 
ideals that we actually do pretty well.

1060
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,160
Um,
but you know,

1061
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,640
if you go all the way completely back 
the other side,

1062
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,820
which is a little bit probably why the 
movement in the sixties and seventies 

1063
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,400
failed.
It was too loose,

1064
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,520
didn't have enough structure,
didn't have enough of the,

1065
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,630
of the,
you know,

1066
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:34,990
the Yang part of it.
It just went to yen.

1067
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:39,991
And the problem with creating these big 
imbalances as the pendulum swing gets 

1068
00:50:39,991 --> 00:50:40,790
too broad.
Yeah.

1069
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,580
Um,
that,

1070
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,430
that,
that is a really good point,

1071
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:46,090
man.
The pendulum swing and it's,

1072
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,760
uh,
it's fascinating how every time a person

1073
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:54,761
gets into a position of power,
there's a corruption and,

1074
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,640
uh,
a deviation from the original intent and

1075
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:03,641
it becomes this,
this sort of dominance issue.

1076
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,070
Like even with Obama,
Obama has.

1077
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,630
Look,
he came from,

1078
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,000
if you look at his past,
he came from a single mother,

1079
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,190
uh,
he's mixed race.

1080
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,270
You look at them,
you say,

1081
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,640
well,
this guy should understand the plight of

1082
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,100
the common folk.
This guy should be,

1083
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:24,101
you know,
someone who represents us because he 

1084
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:24,101
grew up Kinda poor,
you know,

1085
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:26,921
he wasn't a rich kid,
but then he gets into office and he's 

1086
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:30,581
been the one guy who's attacked 
whistleblowers more than any president 

1087
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:31,940
before.

1088
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,970
He's gone after the press more than any 
president before.

1089
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,330
They've dropped more bombs from drones 
than any president before.

1090
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,660
So was he for his,
for a lack of privacy.

1091
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:46,810
He's for infringement on your rights.
He's for restricting constitutional 

1092
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,550
liberty.
He's for changing constitutional and uh,

1093
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:51,470
the,
the,

1094
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:56,471
uh,
amendments that have given us freedoms 

1095
00:51:56,471 --> 00:51:56,930
in this country and restricting them to 
keep you safe.

1096
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,380
All the shit that we've been warned 
about by like our founding fathers,

1097
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:05,650
he who would take freed,
he who would take safety over liberty 

1098
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,080
deserves neither.
You know,

1099
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:11,081
that's like an old school saying and 
this idea that they're going to take 

1100
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:14,801
liberty away from you to protect you.
The drones and it's fucking Obama 

1101
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:18,970
Obama's doing this.
Remember that guy that got into Egypt 

1102
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:18,970
and you know,
they were like,

1103
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,050
well,
you know Egypt throughout that,

1104
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,030
that asshole dictator,
and as soon as this new guy gets in,

1105
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:28,031
he tries to pass all these laws to turn 
himself into a dictator and you're like 

1106
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,110
Jesus Christ and this riots in the 
street like,

1107
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,120
what the fuck did we fight for?

1108
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,980
What is going on and what is exactly 
what exactly is executive privilege?

1109
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:42,190
What the fuck are you talking about?
You mean you don't have to tell us that 

1110
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:46,571
you knew about some crazy program where 
they sold guns to Mexican drug lords.

1111
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,920
Thousands of guns and those guns were 
used on Americans,

1112
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:54,200
civilians,
American citizens.

1113
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:56,960
So the border patrol agent was murdered 
with one of those guns.

1114
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:59,930
This operation fast and furious and 
Obama says,

1115
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:04,931
well,
I'm just going to take executive 

1116
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,191
privilege.
I don't really have to talk about that 

1117
00:53:06,191 --> 00:53:08,650
like crazy.
And I'm not saying he's guilty and I'm 

1118
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,420
not saying that as a president,
he could possibly be aware of everything

1119
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,400
that's going on because I don't think 
you can.

1120
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,700
But the fact that we have some creepy 
get out of jail free pass because that 

1121
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,391
seems like some shit that might put you 
in jail for what you would want from 

1122
00:53:22,391 --> 00:53:23,090
your movie hero president is to say,
hey,

1123
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,250
this is bullshit.
I'm going to take executive privilege.

1124
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,250
The people need to know about this.
This was some whack system that we had 

1125
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:31,250
in the government.
It's going to change.

1126
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,550
But no,
they don't do that,

1127
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:37,850
you know.
And in every instance they kind of push 

1128
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:37,950
things under,
just wait for people to get lazy,

1129
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,040
you know,
whether it's the president or whether 

1130
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,631
it's the UN.
I just watched a great documentary 

1131
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:45,690
called you and me like you for United 
Nations.

1132
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:46,440
Me,
uh,

1133
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:51,441
it's by this Guy Ami Horowitz.
And some of the things we're talking 

1134
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:52,650
about there in the Rwanda crisis was 
unbelievable.

1135
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:57,651
So basically they had the UN,
which is a heavily armed force in the 

1136
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:01,581
area,
can really regulate shit if they wanted 

1137
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:01,581
to.
They got all the machine guns,

1138
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:05,151
they got tanks,
they've got whatever intelligence from 

1139
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:05,151
one of the top kernels.
Kim's back to the UN and says,

1140
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:10,250
Hey,
the Hutus are about to exterminate the 

1141
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:10,250
Tutsis.

1142
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,020
We have the plan,
we have the leaders of the Hutus,

1143
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:18,230
we can take them down,
we can take them out now and prevent a 

1144
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,870
mass genocide.
And this was like a week in advance,

1145
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,360
sending the cable,
send it.

1146
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:21,150
Can't.
Can we do this?

1147
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:23,250
Can we do this?
Can we stop this genocide please?

1148
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:28,370
These are the leaders.
They're are going to get this message 

1149
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:28,370
out.
Can we stop?

1150
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:28,370
Can we stop?
No.

1151
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:28,810
No answer.
No a better stay impartial.

1152
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,150
Better stay impartial.
Well,

1153
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:32,880
what happens exactly what the colonel 
said happens.

1154
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,220
The Hutus go in,
they get their hammers,

1155
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,320
they get their machetes and they just 
run riot.

1156
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:40,050
Everybody with a tootsie identification 
card,

1157
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,670
whacked,
right?

1158
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,550
So eventually all of the Tutsis gather 
at the UN,

1159
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:49,551
puts up a flag and this school posts the
perimeter and there's hundreds and 

1160
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:51,600
hundreds of of Tutsis that have gathered
in this,

1161
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,780
in this building and they're safe for 
temporarily as the UN is there 

1162
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:56,790
protecting them.

1163
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:01,970
And then what happens?
So the Hutus go around and they start 

1164
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:02,670
drinking and they have their bloody 
hammers fresh on their,

1165
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:07,790
their kinsmen blood out there and 
they're just drinking in Taunton and 

1166
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,790
hanging out outside the perimeter.
The UN says,

1167
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:09,510
you know,
what do we do?

1168
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:14,511
What do we got to do?
And the message comes back in from the 

1169
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:14,511
UN,
evacuate the premises,

1170
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,870
evacuated the parents,
and they're like,

1171
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,720
if we do that,
there's 500 people that are going to get

1172
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:20,300
killed with hammers.
You realize that.

1173
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,030
They're like,
yeah,

1174
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:22,410
we can't.
We can't take sides.

1175
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:25,740
Evacuate the premises.
And as they're evacuating the premises,

1176
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:28,620
you see this footage.
They're like hanging on.

1177
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:32,010
They're hanging onto the tank,
please take me there asking them,

1178
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,100
shoot me,
please shoot me so I don't have to deal 

1179
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,580
with what the people with the hammers 
and the machetes and the rape that's 

1180
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:40,580
going to happen.

1181
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,790
If you evacuate us and you leave us 
right now,

1182
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,300
what happens to soldiers?
Beat them off with the end of their guns

1183
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:50,220
crews out and exactly that happens.
They roll into the school mass murder,

1184
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:55,140
mass genocide.
Why aren't we more upset about that?

1185
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,040
That is ridiculous.
What the hell is the UN doing if they're

1186
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:02,370
not there to protect those people in 
that circumstance,

1187
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,680
you know,
and that's just an example of,

1188
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:09,850
you know,
we pick on our own government all the 

1189
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:09,850
time.
Sure we have some certain involvement in

1190
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:13,701
the UN,
but the UN doesn't seem any better and 

1191
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:13,701
it makes sense that,
you know,

1192
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:15,510
probably hardly any other government is 
better.

1193
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:17,760
We're just more active.
Somehow.

1194
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:23,060
This system that has created people in 
power has created a morality where all 

1195
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:23,980
they care

1196
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,610
about is power and money and that's got 
to change.

1197
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:31,930
And how do you get that to change 
without enlightening people?

1198
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,570
And how do you enlightened people,
you know,

1199
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,490
I mean you can't get them to just 
breathe,

1200
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,070
come on,
do it,

1201
00:56:37,071 --> 00:56:39,100
and we'll get you to shut up.
Shamonic breathing.

1202
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:44,370
Everybody sit down.
You got to force them to do Shimano 

1203
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:44,370
breathing.
They need the,

1204
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:48,091
they need the bunker busters.
It's a fascinating situation because we 

1205
00:56:48,091 --> 00:56:52,620
are in this really odd time where we can
learn so much and there's so much 

1206
00:56:53,561 --> 00:56:56,050
information available almost 
instantaneously,

1207
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:01,350
but yet we still are struggling with 
these crazy ape dominance instincts and 

1208
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:06,271
these eight dominance instincts sort of 
get subverted in these large 

1209
00:57:06,271 --> 00:57:10,110
civilization contexts of one person or 
multiple people controlling millions and

1210
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:16,651
having to keep a lid on this bubbling 
cauldron of humanity that you can call a

1211
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:20,740
country and they almost all do the same 
thing.

1212
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,570
They just.
It's a fucking power grab.

1213
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,090
They try to protect themselves as much 
as possible.

1214
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:30,180
They tried to take away your rights,
especially you're right to go after 

1215
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:30,180
them.
You're right to defend yourself.

1216
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,441
They want to take away your guns.
They want to take away anything that 

1217
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:37,051
makes you crazy.
They want to take anything that's going 

1218
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:39,451
to empower you and and somehow or 
another take away from their ability to 

1219
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:41,650
control you.
It's like,

1220
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,460
no,
no.

1221
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:46,270
Society really wants to give people 
equal access to information.

1222
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,880
No society really wanted the Internet.
They just fucked up and it would.

1223
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,920
It sort of snuck up on them and now 
they're stuck in the situation where 

1224
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,441
they're trying to.
They're trying to regulate and trying to

1225
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,950
sort of govern people the way they did 
three,

1226
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,960
four decades ago,
which is a blink of an eye in terms of 

1227
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,220
culture,
but in terms of this society,

1228
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:11,890
it's a million years ago because of the 
Internet,

1229
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,760
so it looks so woefully inadequate 
today.

1230
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:19,060
It looks so clumsy and it's so obviously
corrupt.

1231
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,360
Like I would say that this civil,
this culture that's growing up right 

1232
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,931
now,
this generation knows more about the 

1233
00:58:27,931 --> 00:58:31,561
fact that our government is corrupt and 
how it's corrupt more than any 

1234
00:58:31,561 --> 00:58:31,870
generation before.
Absolutely.

1235
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,330
Like by a long stretch,
long shot.

1236
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,480
There's things that we know about today.
You know,

1237
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,700
when Jimmy,
even things that were in the news,

1238
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:43,930
like the Iran Contra affair.
I mean I remember that was when I was in

1239
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:47,320
my early twenties.
He seen Oliver North on TV and trying to

1240
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:49,660
piece this together and trying to figure
out.

1241
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:50,110
Wait,
wait,

1242
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,940
wait,
why?

1243
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,750
Hold on.
What'd you guys do?

1244
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,680
The visa.
You guys sold arms to Iran.

1245
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,450
What are you doing?
Like what?

1246
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,920
The fuck is going on.
And you did what you,

1247
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,580
the contras and the Sandinistas.
What'd you do?

1248
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:08,730
You so coke in the ghetto.
You guys sold coke to pay for guns.

1249
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,100
Whoa.
Like what kind of government are we run 

1250
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:14,100
in?
Yeah,

1251
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,070
and I,
I think so,

1252
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,360
you know,
to go back to your question,

1253
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:17,590
how do we fix it?
And I,

1254
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:21,950
I think the only way is we have to 
create a pandemic,

1255
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:22,100
an

1256
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,790
epidemic like influenza used to be or 
the black plague used to be,

1257
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,370
but on the good side of pandemic of 
consciousness.

1258
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:33,580
And I think that's one of the beautiful 
things about your show here is that 

1259
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:38,020
we're creating a bit of that momentum.
We're catching people and then these 

1260
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:38,150
ideas,
they're contagious,

1261
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:40,370
you know,
that's why you call it spreading virally

1262
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,460
the whole term from the Internet.
It can be like a virus,

1263
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:44,780
truth,
consciousness,

1264
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,070
awareness can spread and we're all an 
active part of spreading that.

1265
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,530
Each person that we bring in and say,
Hey,

1266
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:52,600
have you seen this?
You know,

1267
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:57,610
I remember one of the things I was,
you know I showed a video about nda is 

1268
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:01,620
just for an example that indefinite 
detention to somebody who was mild,

1269
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,630
I don't know what that is,
a national defense authorization act,

1270
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:07,000
which is a really scary act,
has been passed recently,

1271
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:10,360
which has all sorts of things in there 
that eviscerate the bill of rights.

1272
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:15,361
One of them is indefinite detention 
where they can take someone who's an 

1273
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:18,451
American citizen.
Then they suspect them something and 

1274
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:18,490
they can just attain them.
They don't have to have a lawyer,

1275
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:19,990
they don't have to.
Like you don't have any rights,

1276
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:25,020
you don't have any rights anymore.
It's basically just like the king 

1277
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:25,020
throwing you in the dungeon.
Yep.

1278
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,160
And this is real shit that our 
politicians have passed.

1279
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,360
We've been hijacked

1280
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,140
essentially.
So I showed this video to someone who is

1281
01:00:31,141 --> 01:00:33,120
mildly pro Obama,
not crazy,

1282
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:38,121
really kind of APP.
Took herself out of the old political 

1283
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:38,121
picture and I was like,
listen,

1284
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:41,160
this is a bill that he allowed to pass 
and showed her all the details about it.

1285
01:00:41,161 --> 01:00:44,770
Basically it was a video describing 
exactly what you said and,

1286
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:46,360
and going through it in about a two 
minute video,

1287
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,670
she's like,
oh my God,

1288
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,470
really?
Whoa.

1289
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:54,730
You know,
and at that moment you could see there 

1290
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:54,730
was a shift there,
you know,

1291
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,120
she understood something that wasn't she
wasn't aware of.

1292
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,580
And every time that happens,
you know,

1293
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,280
we make those little marks.
It starts to spread virally.

1294
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:07,281
And at certain point I believe that it 
will get to a critical mass where the 

1295
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:09,840
people just will no longer tolerate it 
and will be the majority.

1296
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,200
And at that point we'll have to clean 
house and they're gonna clean.

1297
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:18,350
You know,
the old power structure is going to 

1298
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,731
clean.
They're going to come up with some 

1299
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:19,731
really crazy fucked up rules.
And I think at the height of it,

1300
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:21,720
unfortunately there's going to be 
conflict.

1301
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:24,300
I think it's inevitable.
I don't know what that's going to be,

1302
01:01:24,301 --> 01:01:29,301
but it's gonna get really nasty when the
movement of consciousness runs square 

1303
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:34,170
against the kind of Reptilian power grab
of the old structure.

1304
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:39,350
And that's going to be a trying time.
But I think they'll die off or they'll 

1305
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,530
die off smoothly,
pull in their place that's possible.

1306
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,680
And hopefully that's the best case,
the best.

1307
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,910
That's the way we want it to be.
The way want it

1308
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,950
to be is that the young people coming up
now,

1309
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:49,440
the ones that are in college right now,
the people that are listening to this,

1310
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,910
when they're riding their bike to school
here,

1311
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:56,930
the ones that are gonna be responsible 
for running this fucking crazy machine 

1312
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:56,970
in the future.
If,

1313
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,700
if the whole world is aware what the 
fuck is going on,

1314
01:01:59,701 --> 01:02:02,820
it's harder and harder to fuck people.
It's just harder.

1315
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,880
And I think right now they're still able
to lock down enough that they can 

1316
01:02:08,011 --> 01:02:11,460
operate in the old way.
And when you see things like the,

1317
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,210
the NSA's idea of building this we,
Abby Martin and um,

1318
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,590
uh,
what's her name was the other gal?

1319
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,470
Well David Seaman,
it was his thing as well.

1320
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,700
We had him on and he was explaining to 
us what,

1321
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:30,740
what they're trying to do that there.
They're building this gigantic compound 

1322
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:35,601
in Utah,
which essentially copies every email 

1323
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:38,631
that every American citizen makes.
Every phone call that you make is 

1324
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,680
recorded.
Every picture that you text someone,

1325
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,920
so all your Dick Pics,
all those are going to be recording so 

1326
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,140
that if they ever have anything that 
they have to bring out an Abra.

1327
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,980
Marcus,
what are you doing?

1328
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:54,000
I'm in Florida and did you,
you know,

1329
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:56,140
whatever.
Did you fucking burn the American flag?

1330
01:02:56,141 --> 01:02:57,640
You like,
what are you talking about?

1331
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:02,641
Like,
well we have here your emails that say 

1332
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:02,760
that you were on your way to Florida 
burn the flag.

1333
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:07,761
We have.
You get a flag he bought at Walmart 

1334
01:03:07,761 --> 01:03:08,970
because we traced your credit card.
We have here.

1335
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,400
You know the phone calls he made 
bragging about it.

1336
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:13,080
You want us to play them back for you 
and you're like,

1337
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:14,940
what?
And you realize like,

1338
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:20,060
my whole life is being recorded and 
every email I make I have to assume now 

1339
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,890
that someone's listening and reading my 
emails,

1340
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:25,380
listening to my phone calls and reading 
my emails.

1341
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,670
Who are these people and what?
Because they get elected,

1342
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,170
do they even get elected?
I mean,

1343
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:36,171
when you're in the NSA,
do you get elected to just get hired so 

1344
01:03:36,171 --> 01:03:37,860
you get hired so you get hired and you 
get to be the one who decides whether or

1345
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:40,090
not they can look at your Dick Pics,
like what?

1346
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:44,010
What kind of a world we live in,
in where some small group of people have

1347
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:46,170
that kind of power with the rest of us.
I can't.

1348
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:50,160
If someone hacks into your email,
those are those people can go to jail.

1349
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,840
Okay.
If a regular person,

1350
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:56,870
some if Brian gets nutty and he decides 
to hack into some girl's email and 

1351
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:02,450
starts reading her emails that she could
find out about that and she could have 

1352
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:05,220
him arrested and he can go to jail.
You can do like cyber terrorism.

1353
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:10,221
You could do time for that,
but if the NSA says it's okay and that's

1354
01:04:10,711 --> 01:04:13,380
your Gig and you press that button which
says,

1355
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:18,360
record all our micro markets as emails.
That somehow is okay.

1356
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:22,770
That that's insanity,
that that is the height of insanity.

1357
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,620
We're not talking about criminals here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1358
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:30,060
we're talking about the entire 
population of the United States.

1359
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,920
Wrap your head around that,
you know,

1360
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:34,170
innocent until proven guilty.
Yeah.

1361
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:39,260
Not so much.
The idea is they're going to record all 

1362
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:39,260
of your shit,
but don't worry,

1363
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,560
they won't send your Dick pics out as 
long as you keep it.

1364
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,740
Now imagine a scenario where what makes 
this particularly vial is the fact that 

1365
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,940
there's so many unjust laws.
I mean,

1366
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:55,920
if every law was perfectly just and 
based upon harming somebody else,

1367
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,650
then it would be like,
yeah,

1368
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,130
what are they going to fucking catch me 
for?

1369
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:04,131
You know,
whatever it's going to be like the only 

1370
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:04,620
people who would get caught with the 
murderers,

1371
01:05:04,621 --> 01:05:05,700
rapists,
people like that.

1372
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:10,820
But because there's so many unjust 
bullshit laws like these laws around 

1373
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,930
your own,
you know,

1374
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,120
personal freedoms,
like whether you want sexual freedoms,

1375
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,200
um,
you know,

1376
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:18,280
what you ingest in your body,
what kind of,

1377
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:23,450
you know,
whether you want to smoke weed or 

1378
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:24,901
whether you wanted whatever.
All of these unjust laws give them so 

1379
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:26,020
much more leveraged.
It's like the church saying that,

1380
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,270
you know,
masturbating and sex is a sin.

1381
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,430
Well guess what?
You got a whole bunch of fucking centers

1382
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:33,880
then and then once you have sinners then
you can manipulate them with guilt,

1383
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:39,050
you know,
and then you can manipulate them with 

1384
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:39,280
absolution and you can control them.
But if they didn't do that,

1385
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:40,480
if the church was like,
yeah,

1386
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:44,110
you just have to be a good person and 
try your best and you're not a sinner,

1387
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,250
you know,
it'd be like,

1388
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,630
oh sweet,
I qualify.

1389
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:51,900
So the lighter church and they'll put 
the bullshit of the cycle of evil and 

1390
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,431
this is where it gets really screwy is 
that there's a good percentage of our 

1391
01:05:56,431 --> 01:06:00,601
prisons that are private,
which means they're businesses that 

1392
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:00,930
profit fit

1393
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,960
off of people being in jail.
And so they and the prison guard unions 

1394
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:11,450
lobby to make sure that there's more 
laws that they can use to lock you up 

1395
01:06:12,691 --> 01:06:17,691
and fill their prisons to make money.
So it is essentially legalized slavery.

1396
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:23,810
And there's a lot of those laws,
especially when it comes to the drug 

1397
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,170
laws that absolutely make no fucking 
sense.

1398
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:31,190
They're not based on science.
They're not based on what we know about 

1399
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:34,491
the human body in 2013,
especially like marijuana laws and no 

1400
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:37,290
ways that based on anything rational in 
in any way,

1401
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:42,291
shape or form yet it's still federal law
and they can take you and throw you in 

1402
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:47,841
there magic box where you make them 
money and they want to do that and 

1403
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:48,990
that's legal.
That's.

1404
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:54,050
That's a strange thing.
That is a very strange thing to be 

1405
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:58,670
operating like that in 2013 that people 
are making money off of locking people 

1406
01:06:59,581 --> 01:06:59,790
up.

1407
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:05,210
Some of like the guy in Montana,
there's a famous story of a gentleman 

1408
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,231
who was in jail because he had guns as 
well as medical marijuana and they pass 

1409
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:14,460
some new things saying that if you have 
guns and you're,

1410
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:15,900
you know,
you're involved in marijuana,

1411
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:18,300
it makes it way worse because then it 
makes you like a crazy drug dealer.

1412
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:23,301
Like you're one of those Mexican narco 
was a hold up in Humboldt with fucking 

1413
01:07:23,301 --> 01:07:23,370
machine guns and shit.
But no.

1414
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:28,371
This is a guy that was like a hunter who
also decided to run a medical marijuana 

1415
01:07:28,371 --> 01:07:31,920
farm because he was trying to make money
because he thought that it was the law.

1416
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:37,040
He had these local politicians,
local cops come over and inspect his 

1417
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:41,991
plant,
like everything looks good and he's 

1418
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,331
like,
here's the list of people that I'm 

1419
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:44,331
selling to these.
These plants are all dedicated to them.

1420
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:44,970
This one goes to this person,
this is a,

1421
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,770
this is their medicine.
And um,

1422
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,600
um,
I'm a farmer and I'm going to be able to

1423
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:50,310
feed my family and make a living doing 
that.

1424
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,170
Now that you guys up for a possible,
they might lock him up,

1425
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,090
Jeff,
or 80 years.

1426
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,080
No,
that's,

1427
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,610
that's great.
For what?

1428
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:58,140
For.
Is it because he's shooting?

1429
01:07:58,141 --> 01:07:59,160
People have.
No,

1430
01:07:59,161 --> 01:07:59,430
no,
no,

1431
01:07:59,431 --> 01:07:59,730
no,
no.

1432
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:05,180
Is it because he's a felon?
He's not supposed to have guns because 

1433
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:05,340
he's been shown abroad people.
Oh,

1434
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:05,670
no,
no,

1435
01:08:05,671 --> 01:08:05,880
no,
no.

1436
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,260
It's just a farmer.
Okay.

1437
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:12,320
Is it because he's hurting somebody?
What is the easy growing something 

1438
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:12,320
that's bad?
Oh,

1439
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:12,320
no,
no,

1440
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:12,900
no.
He's just growing medicine.

1441
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:16,160
That's state approved medicine.
So they can put this guy

1442
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,820
in jail for essentially a non crime 
first in the state.

1443
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,160
It's come.
Everything he did is completely legal.

1444
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,610
His use of firearms is recreational and 
for hunting purposes,

1445
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:30,790
like this guy's not a narco terrorists,
but yet they can use all these bullshit 

1446
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:35,651
laws and arrested,
probably confiscated a lot of material 

1447
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,460
that they took it all.
It's always we'd his money too.

1448
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,720
They come in and Jack your money and 
your weed and what they do in 

1449
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,431
California,
it's kind of cute is because Obama said 

1450
01:08:45,431 --> 01:08:46,730
that he's not going to target anybody 
who breaks.

1451
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,160
Only the state law said is if they break
both state and federal law,

1452
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:57,161
then we're going to come after him or 
rather not federal offense because it's 

1453
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:57,350
all federally illegal.
So he said if they're,

1454
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,820
if they break the state law as well as 
the federal law than uh,

1455
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,190
then they're open for press is when he 
first said when he got into office.

1456
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,260
So this is what they do.
This is how cute they are.

1457
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:11,590
So they don't really put you in jail.
A lot of the times what they do is they 

1458
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:13,430
arrest you,
they open up the place,

1459
01:09:13,431 --> 01:09:15,830
they come in with guns,
they scare the fuck out anybody,

1460
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,590
they take all of your weed and then they
take all your money.

1461
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,230
They take everybody's information down 
and they do nothing,

1462
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:27,360
so it's the jacket jacket that's a jack,
so instead of arresting you and 

1463
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,860
prosecuting you and putting you in jail 
instead of doing that,

1464
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:35,360
what they're doing more often is just 
taking all your shit and then saying the

1465
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:40,361
case is open and they never do anything 
about it because they really don't have 

1466
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:41,150
the resources to prosecuting these 
cases.

1467
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:46,151
They really don't have resources to go 
after all these guys that are running 

1468
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:49,001
these medical marijuana shops because 
there's twice as many of them as there 

1469
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:49,001
are.

1470
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:49,001
Starbucks.
I mean the,

1471
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,750
the,
the numbers of medical marijuana clinics

1472
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:53,900
in southern California is somewhere in 
the thousands.

1473
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,870
They don't even know how many 
dispensaries rather.

1474
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:58,520
They don't even know how many they have.
There are.

1475
01:09:58,521 --> 01:10:03,521
They're everywhere.
Fucking things and some of them are 

1476
01:10:03,521 --> 01:10:05,440
operating illegally,
but they don't give a shit if they come 

1477
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,771
in.
They take all your stuff and they take 

1478
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:09,260
all your money and some people you know,
do a little time here and there,

1479
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,540
but for the most part for like really 
egregious things,

1480
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,300
we'll do a little time here and there 
for most parts.

1481
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,160
Jacking.
Yeah.

1482
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,090
You know,
it's for people who,

1483
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:21,240
you know,
aren't sympathetic to the marijuana 

1484
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,231
cause,
which I don't know if anybody listening 

1485
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,231
to this show isn't sympathetic to that 
cause,

1486
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,460
but presuming there were,
you can take the cars out to the Ra,

1487
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,960
the whole raw milk.

1488
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,220
You know,
you can take that out too.

1489
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:30,200
That I watched a documentary called 
farmagedden.

1490
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:34,460
Same thing,
gunned know agents with guns going in,

1491
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,920
locking up yogurt,
freezers,

1492
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,240
yogurt,
freezers,

1493
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:43,540
and then jacking these farms.
There's like little farms they're 

1494
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:43,540
selling to people.
You got these kids saying,

1495
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,220
oh my asthma was way better when I was 
drinking the whole milk.

1496
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,290
Raw milk is.
It's obviously way better for you all.

1497
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,620
I'll a lot of this lactose intolerance 
and stuff.

1498
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:54,590
It's because of the way that they 
homogenized,

1499
01:10:55,250 --> 01:11:00,250
pasteurized and processed the milk,
which is great if you're dealing with a 

1500
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,420
city and you have to store milk for 
weeks in advance.

1501
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:06,590
It is certainly more healthy than 
getting people raw milk that goes bad.

1502
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:08,810
Then everybody gets sick and that can 
happen too.

1503
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:13,811
So I see why it was invented.
But the idea someone could have a source

1504
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,570
where they could be.
They could get raw milk and they can get

1505
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:21,120
it from a farm and that farm sells it to
the supermarket.

1506
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:22,500
You know,
it's all safe and fresh.

1507
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:23,560
It's dated,
it's all good,

1508
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,940
but that's illegal.
That.

1509
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:28,320
And not only that,
they'll arrest you with guns.

1510
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:29,070
Guns drawn.

1511
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,560
Yeah.
I guess what would happen though,

1512
01:11:30,561 --> 01:11:32,870
if the government didn't come in and 
regulate that,

1513
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,710
well,
you know,

1514
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,720
consumers would start to look for,
hey,

1515
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,820
do I want this milk or do I want this 
milk?

1516
01:11:37,821 --> 01:11:42,821
And you start to identify brands or 
there'd be consumer watchdog services 

1517
01:11:42,821 --> 01:11:43,010
that came up and said,
hey,

1518
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,200
these milks are good.
These milks or sketch,

1519
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:50,270
you know,
don't drink these milks and the system 

1520
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,620
would self correct itself and instead of
locking people up,

1521
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:55,430
it taking away whole stashes of yogurt.

1522
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,730
Sandwiches work.
Yeah.

1523
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:02,800
And what?
Where's the system in effect for the 

1524
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,051
pharmaceutical industry?
How many fucking people drop dead every 

1525
01:12:05,051 --> 01:12:08,200
year for Oxycontin's and what?
Why aren't they beating down their door 

1526
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:08,200
with guns and trying to figure out what 
the fuck's going on here?

1527
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,130
No,
no.

1528
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:12,530
Then the too busy arresting farmers for 
bad yogurt,

1529
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:15,060
right?
God dammit.

1530
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:17,300
And by bad yogurt we mean good yogurt.
Yeah,

1531
01:12:17,301 --> 01:12:20,450
by Delicious Yogurt.
It's a strange thing man.

1532
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,630
We have a strange world and it's a,
it's,

1533
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,780
it's,
it's all going through a growth phase.

1534
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:32,020
It's like a 16 year old is throwing 
temper tantrums because they about to 

1535
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:32,120
become a grownup and they're not quite 
there yet,

1536
01:12:32,121 --> 01:12:35,000
but they're fucking think they are.
I'll fucking tell you bitch,

1537
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:36,020
you know,
and they get crazy.

1538
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:38,480
It's,
it's real weird.

1539
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,130
It's really weird to be a part of.

1540
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:45,190
And you know,
the fact that you have the government 

1541
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:45,350
telling you what is good for you and 
what is not good for you.

1542
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:50,710
It kind of removes people's 
responsibility to take the onus on 

1543
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:50,710
themselves to say,
Hey,

1544
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,790
I'm going to go out and procure what's 
good for my body.

1545
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,190
A lot of people just blindly trust like,
oh yeah,

1546
01:12:55,191 --> 01:12:56,580
the FDA says it's good.
Oh yeah,

1547
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:57,400
yeah,
that's good.

1548
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,400
It's FDA approved

1549
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,230
one source than a government resource at
this point in time.

1550
01:13:02,231 --> 01:13:05,680
There should be,
instead of a government resources should

1551
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:10,681
be consumer based resources that are 
more effective because they're motivated

1552
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:12,400
by something other than just having a 
job.

1553
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,580
It's something they have a passion in 
what I don't believe in.

1554
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,850
Whenever you have a government agency 
like that and like God who gets that job

1555
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:19,510
is,
I mean,

1556
01:13:19,511 --> 01:13:24,511
are you sure that that guy is really 
fucking into making sure that yogurt 

1557
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:24,700
safe or is he just some asshole with a 
job?

1558
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:25,480
You know?
And

1559
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,550
you never know.
And it could be even good people in that

1560
01:13:28,551 --> 01:13:30,950
system.
They have to enforce bad laws.

1561
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:33,950
These people in all of these 
organizations,

1562
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,740
they could very well be good people and 
you hear stories of them just saying,

1563
01:13:36,741 --> 01:13:38,090
look,
I just couldn't take it anymore.

1564
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:40,340
You know,
I'm having to enforce bad laws that come

1565
01:13:40,341 --> 01:13:43,280
in with a positive ideal in every one of
these bodies,

1566
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:48,281
but just the system is designed to force
them to enforce messed up laws and 

1567
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,870
that's,
that creates a problem.

1568
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:55,930
But,
but going back to what I was saying 

1569
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:55,930
that,
you know,

1570
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:56,420
when someone's telling you what to do,
you don't take that onus on yourself.

1571
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:01,630
I think it's really.
They think everybody thinks that it's 

1572
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:05,171
really helping people,
but ultimately the only person that can 

1573
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:06,370
decide what is good or bad for you.
You know,

1574
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,650
the only person that decide what's good 
for Joe Rogan,

1575
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:09,870
Joe Rogan,
you know,

1576
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:15,010
you got to do the research,
got to figure it out and figure out 

1577
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:15,010
what's good for your body.

1578
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:20,090
You know,
you are a really cool analogy that I 

1579
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:20,090
just recently heard.
You know,

1580
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,570
we have millions of different cells in 
our body.

1581
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:26,410
We all know that and if you think of 
those cells is individual life forms.

1582
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:31,650
Then we have millions of lifeforms that 
are under our control and doing our 

1583
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:31,930
bidding.
Thank Leslie.

1584
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:37,110
They just go to work everyday and do 
what they're supposed to do for us and 

1585
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,440
we are like their God.
We are their rulers.

1586
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:43,441
We control their life and death.
We can make their life difficult or we 

1587
01:14:43,441 --> 01:14:43,660
can make their life good.
We have feeding.

1588
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:48,661
I'm shit.
We are the gods of our body and you can 

1589
01:14:48,661 --> 01:14:52,891
almost say they work so hard and so well
for us that they could almost say they 

1590
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:52,891
pray to us,
you know,

1591
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:57,630
whatever analogy you want to use,
they're there for us and what do we do 

1592
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:57,630
for.
Yeah,

1593
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,650
exactly.
The coffee's probably not nearly the bad

1594
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:01,060
thing that we do to them,
but yeah,

1595
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:02,830
that makes it.
That makes an impact.

1596
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:07,860
Cigarettes.
Cigarettes should the bad processed 

1597
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,950
foods that you get.
No Green,

1598
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:12,040
no vegetables.
We come from the earth.

1599
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,290
We got to put a little bit of that back.
Know,

1600
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,970
put some real fuel back in there.

1601
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,420
It's one of the things that people 
neglect more than anything.

1602
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:21,840
The nutrition and health and exercise.
I mean,

1603
01:15:21,841 --> 01:15:26,841
I've obviously,
I've had intelligent friends that laugh 

1604
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:26,850
that mock me for working out,
you know,

1605
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:29,520
they think it's beneath them.
I'm like,

1606
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:31,230
okay,
by being lazy,

1607
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,690
you're,
you're limiting the quality of your life

1608
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:38,750
and you think that that's smart.
I think he's just being lazy and you 

1609
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,540
just sort of justifying it with this 
like,

1610
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,730
you know,
silly attitude.

1611
01:15:41,731 --> 01:15:45,980
The silly hipster like attitude.
There's nothing would ever gives a shit.

1612
01:15:45,981 --> 01:15:47,460
You can do it anyway,
you know,

1613
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:47,980
that kind of.
Yeah.

1614
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:52,520
To live like that or they discredit the 
value of it,

1615
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,660
but it's not just about physicality.
It's about what that does for your mind.

1616
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:59,210
Yes.
The confidence in certain situations,

1617
01:15:59,211 --> 01:16:03,590
the ability to have that,
to take care of yourself as a man,

1618
01:16:03,591 --> 01:16:05,270
as a woman,
as a human being,

1619
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,370
you know,
if it messes,

1620
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,440
it changes your mental dynamic.

1621
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:14,610
He certainly does and I,
I also think that your mind functions 

1622
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:14,610
better.
I mean,

1623
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,020
you can have a really brilliant person 
that doesn't take care of their body,

1624
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:21,021
but man,
would they be even more brilliant if 

1625
01:16:21,021 --> 01:16:21,021
they did take care of their body?
I think they would.

1626
01:16:21,021 --> 01:16:24,891
I think the amount of emphasis that you 
put on your mental function can be 

1627
01:16:24,891 --> 01:16:29,840
delayed or retarded by the fact that 
your body's not keeping up or that your 

1628
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,580
body's sending shitty signals so your 
body's tired all the time he bought.

1629
01:16:32,581 --> 01:16:35,430
He needs naps all the time.
Your body is breaking down.

1630
01:16:35,431 --> 01:16:40,431
It's always getting sick.
It's always that that derails the 

1631
01:16:40,431 --> 01:16:40,530
quality of your thinking.
Totally.

1632
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,040
Unquestionably,
and having excess stress in your mind 

1633
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,700
rose,
the quality of your thinking as well,

1634
01:16:47,701 --> 01:16:48,400
because you,
you're,

1635
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:50,910
you're quicker to pull the trigger.
You quicker to yell.

1636
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:52,840
You're quicker to be upset about things.
You're.

1637
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:57,870
You're not in control of your vehicle.
Right?

1638
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,630
Silly pitches,
right?

1639
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:02,220
Yeah.
People need martial arts band.

1640
01:17:02,221 --> 01:17:07,221
That's what I say.
I say we need to teach them in fucking 

1641
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:07,221
school.
I think kids,

1642
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:11,151
every kid in school,
it should be something learn like 

1643
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:11,151
English.

1644
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:13,130
You should learn martial arts and it 
should be in grade school,

1645
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:14,450
Middle School,
high school,

1646
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:16,250
College.
I really think so.

1647
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:19,730
I think there would be way less,
way less.

1648
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,750
I think the.
It's,

1649
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:25,860
it's one of those weird things where 
people think that it would create 

1650
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:28,511
bullies,
but I think it would be just the 

1651
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:28,511
opposite.
The opposite.

1652
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:28,511
Yeah.
The discipline,

1653
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:32,350
self respect to get.
And if you're doing something like 

1654
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,721
Jujitsu now,
pure striking stools can create some 

1655
01:17:34,721 --> 01:17:34,721
massive egos.
We've seen that,

1656
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:39,940
but you know something like you did,
so it's very difficult to create a 

1657
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:40,730
massive,
disproportionate ego in that,

1658
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
you know,
unless there's some cases where 

1659
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,370
someone's just so good that they just 
beat everybody and then they get to be a

1660
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:47,180
dick.
I guess.

1661
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:52,240
Especially if it's like one of those 
kids that grows up quicker than the 

1662
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:52,490
other kids are like super fast twitch 
muscle fibers.

1663
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,140
Yeah,
that's possible too.

1664
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:59,170
But I think man,
it would cut down on so much if more 

1665
01:17:59,170 --> 01:17:59,780
people had that kind of a discipline in 
your life.

1666
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,870
We're trying to fix the world.
Somebody.

1667
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,810
I had somebody on the podcast once and 
we were talking about kettlebells,

1668
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:05,930
battle ropes,
shit like that,

1669
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,940
and the guy goes,
are you making a fucking army?

1670
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,740
Like what's going on here,
man?

1671
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,100
He'd getting people to work out and take
vitamins and shit,

1672
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:18,101
and then you.
Then you tell them the propaganda's 

1673
01:18:18,101 --> 01:18:18,950
bullshit and they need to go on.
No,

1674
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,810
we're not making it an army,
but you can make your own army.

1675
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,720
You could follow our advice,
make your own shit.

1676
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,780
I'm on fucking army.
No time for that.

1677
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:28,940
Can't even say that.
You say you're making an army.

1678
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:32,190
The NSA light goes off,
blue light goes off.

1679
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,360
We're creating consciousness.
We're creating a consciousness epidemic.

1680
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,030
It's going to be like the.
I Dunno,

1681
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,130
I don't know what color his left in 
these plagues.

1682
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,450
So that's the thing.
That's a funny thing.

1683
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:46,451
I was just thinking about.
You have these analogies of horrible 

1684
01:18:46,451 --> 01:18:46,940
destructive things happening on a large 
scale,

1685
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,310
but what's like the nuclear bomb of 
goodness,

1686
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:54,680
like nothing exists.
Blowjobs in the nuclear bomb.

1687
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:55,820
Oh goodness.
All right.

1688
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,200
It's all a gift.
Yes.

1689
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,090
You're not giving anything back just 
coming to you,

1690
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:05,060
but it only happens on a one on one 
basis.

1691
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:10,061
It would need to be a massive 500,000
person at a time blow job and if there 

1692
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:13,910
was something they could do that,
that would become the analogy.

1693
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:19,450
Do you think that this shamonic 
breathing thing is something that could 

1694
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:22,130
be taught?
Like in classes like yoga classes,

1695
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:24,320
we can get a bunch of people to 
experiencing it together?

1696
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:29,530
I do.
I think if people were willing to 

1697
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:29,530
explore,
I think you'd have to stay.

1698
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:34,080
I think that's one method.
I think isolation tanks or another 

1699
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,211
method.
I think a lot of these methods need to 

1700
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:38,720
be explored and proliferated throughout.
You know,

1701
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:41,170
throughout our consciousness as a tool,
you know,

1702
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,620
it needs to be taught like,
hey,

1703
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:45,890
you want to get back in touch with 
something that's a little more real,

1704
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:50,950
that's a little bit deeper in yourself.
That's not clouded by all of the voices 

1705
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:54,791
of the dream is the toltec say,
or our emotions and our needs and our 

1706
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,080
wants and when all this crap that's 
going on in our head,

1707
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,450
you want to tap into something a little 
deeper,

1708
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:04,451
a little more real,
a little more connected to your fellow 

1709
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:04,451
life.
You know,

1710
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:05,840
this is one method.
This is another method,

1711
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,710
you know,
and then,

1712
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:08,010
hey,
maybe for

1713
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
some of you,
here's some other things that totally 

1714
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:15,800
obviously you know,
we believe should be legal like 

1715
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,970
mushrooms and then get it down to a 
science where you know exactly how much,

1716
01:20:17,971 --> 01:20:19,940
what your dose is.
Maybe go on a stale,

1717
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:24,950
get your,
get your accurate biometrics combined 

1718
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,831
science with shamanism to create 
reproducible results and an experience 

1719
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:33,351
that's not clinical but not entirely 
just on the fringe of spirituality as 

1720
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:38,391
well,
and I think you could really affect 

1721
01:20:38,391 --> 01:20:38,610
people's consciousness doing it in that 
way.

1722
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:43,670
What's the laws on sending people down 
to Peru or Brazil or to do Iowaska 

1723
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:46,680
ceremonies?
I think

1724
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:52,560
far as I understand it,
you abide by the laws of the country 

1725
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:52,820
that you're in.
You know their federal.

1726
01:20:52,821 --> 01:20:53,100
There's no

1727
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:54,600
federal jurisdiction.
True anymore.

1728
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:59,900
I think there's been new regulations 
that have been passed that say that if 

1729
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,741
you do illegal things and other 
countries that you can be prosecuted 

1730
01:21:03,741 --> 01:21:04,770
farm here in America.
And I think.

1731
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

1732
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:10,780
And I think the idea behind that,
I think that what the use was 

1733
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,121
pedophilia.
I think it was one of the things that 

1734
01:21:14,121 --> 01:21:15,510
they use to sort of sneak that thought 
go into Thailand,

1735
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,600
which I agree with 100 percent.
Not that I agree with pedophilia.

1736
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:20,000
That's not what I said.
You Fox.

1737
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:22,590
What I,
what I said was that I agree that yeah,

1738
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,210
you should prosecute people for doing 
that.

1739
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:25,800
Prosecute people that are doing that 
anywhere.

1740
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:28,530
It doesn't matter if it's legal or not,
that's a fucking crime on humanity,

1741
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,590
but the fact that,
uh,

1742
01:21:30,591 --> 01:21:30,940
you,
you,

1743
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:36,050
they might be able to use that against.
You never heard of a case of that 

1744
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:36,090
actually coming.
Yeah,

1745
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:39,420
that's the problem.
It's like the laws that are in place,

1746
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,570
you know,
especially with the NDA,

1747
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:45,410
there's no been no cases of that either 
and you can't really

1748
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:50,060
be prosecuted for doing a past substance
either.

1749
01:21:50,061 --> 01:21:53,550
So it would be really tricky to try and 
prosecute someone past substance,

1750
01:21:53,551 --> 01:21:55,850
like saying like if someone says,
if someone says,

1751
01:21:55,851 --> 01:21:56,990
yeah,
I did acid,

1752
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,100
you know,
a year ago,

1753
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,110
you know,
that is not prosecutable.

1754
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,330
Dan would be fucked.
Well No,

1755
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:04,260
only yeah,
right.

1756
01:22:04,261 --> 01:22:09,261
From then before the.
I think there would have to be 

1757
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:09,690
grandfathered in.
Right?

1758
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:14,740
Yeah.
Because it'd be interesting this new 

1759
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,281
law,
like if you went there now and they 

1760
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:17,130
found out that you did marijuana and 
Amsterdam month ago,

1761
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,840
would they be able to prosecute you?
I don't think so.

1762
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:23,450
Someone knocking on the door and if so 
why are you answering it?

1763
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,390
Don't answer that Shit.
I would say that,

1764
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:33,391
uh,
I would say that you can't get 

1765
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:33,391
prosecuted.
I would hate to,

1766
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:37,110
you know,
I would hate to deter people from going 

1767
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,780
on these journeys and expeditions with 
that fear of mine.

1768
01:22:37,781 --> 01:22:39,700
I just,
whether the laws they're not.

1769
01:22:39,701 --> 01:22:42,970
I think practically it's a,
I haven't heard of a case of it,

1770
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,550
but I'd like to explore that and see it.

1771
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:47,760
Sure.
That the real issue would be like say if

1772
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,090
we decided to create some sort of a 
counseling service,

1773
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:56,091
we sit down with people and the decide 
whether or not they're crazy or 

1774
01:22:56,091 --> 01:22:58,530
undercover cops and then allow them to 
sign up and go to Brazil.

1775
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:04,070
There's a,
there's people who do that already to a 

1776
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:04,500
certain degree.
Um,

1777
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,670
I don't know.
They haven't got,

1778
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:11,671
they haven't been fucked with as far as 
the ones that I know or anybody that 

1779
01:23:11,671 --> 01:23:14,611
I've heard of,
but they could be just flying under the 

1780
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:14,611
radar possible.
Yeah,

1781
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:18,480
that's possible.
The issue is what happens if someone 

1782
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,700
actually tries to do something like that
and create a service and we should,

1783
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:23,770
we should explore that and get some more
knowledge.

1784
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:25,010
We're just talking out our ass,
right?

1785
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,290
We don't really know what's going on,
but yeah,

1786
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:27,940
we,
I like,

1787
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,810
I like your thinking and that's been 
also part of my thinking is what are the

1788
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:36,811
ways that we can do things fully above 
board because we can't in consciousness 

1789
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:40,060
recommend people to do illegal things.
The risk is there.

1790
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:41,730
The stress of doing that is there,
you know,

1791
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,160
we're not trying to do that,
but we want to create a change and a lot

1792
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:46,480
of these changes change.

1793
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,600
Creating events are illegal buyer 
government.

1794
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:51,340
So how to work our way around that.
Well,

1795
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:55,060
some of the things find the legal 
psychedelic experiences breathing,

1796
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,620
you know,
isolation tanks,

1797
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:02,040
certain types of meditation.
But that's then if you want to take it 

1798
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:02,040
farther.
Yeah,

1799
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,940
go out of the country.
I know in Canada,

1800
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:05,890
even the Boga is,
is legal.

1801
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,940
I know South America,
Canada,

1802
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:08,760
it's legal.
Yeah.

1803
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,220
And in UK,
Canada and UK,

1804
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:17,230
bogus legal.
And then in most of South America I was 

1805
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:21,191
because legal and also the church,
the Church of Santa Diamond or udv and 

1806
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,260
always get those two mixed up.
I think there's two.

1807
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,330
There's two.
They're both illegal now.

1808
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,420
I think both of us both.
Yes.

1809
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:32,730
So that may be another way too,
is really kind of allow people to 

1810
01:24:33,161 --> 01:24:38,161
become.
Explain that for people don't know what 

1811
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:38,161
the fuck you're talking about.
So there's a,

1812
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:40,870
there's a freedom of religion act that 
allows you to have your sacrament,

1813
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,730
whatever that sacrament can be.

1814
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:47,790
If it's intrinsic to your religion and 
there's two religions based out of 

1815
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:51,610
Brazil that focus on the Iowasca as a 
major sacrament,

1816
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:56,000
um,
and that's the union has a vigil to Lisa

1817
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:56,610
does,
I don't know,

1818
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:01,980
it's in important.
And then there's the church is sent to 

1819
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:01,980
diamond,
which is another one.

1820
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:06,060
And both of them use ios because the 
sacrament and they brought it all the 

1821
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,060
way to the supreme court and said,
hey,

1822
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,550
we want to use our sacrament to express 
our religious freedoms.

1823
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,030
And um,
you know,

1824
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:14,380
one good good move by the supreme court 
is they,

1825
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:19,500
they upheld that based on the freedom of
religion act and there was precedence 

1826
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,830
for that based on the native American 
church,

1827
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,080
uh,
claiming pod as their sacrament.

1828
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:28,670
Well,
you know that Alex Grey is creating his 

1829
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:28,670
own church.
Yeah.

1830
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:29,270
Yeah.
It's just fascinating stuff.

1831
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:30,960
Oh,
hey matt.

1832
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,750
We're in the middle of a podcast,
so go fuck yourself.

1833
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:38,751
This is live.
Got Five minutes.

1834
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:41,820
Yeah,
come sit down.

1835
01:25:41,821 --> 01:25:43,530
Relax.
This is Eddie Brill.

1836
01:25:43,531 --> 01:25:47,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
who's a good friend from the old school,

1837
01:25:47,311 --> 01:25:52,311
Boston days of standup comedy,
who gave me some good advice when I was 

1838
01:25:52,311 --> 01:25:54,030
a young pup back in the day.
Hold on and he's got to turn this on for

1839
01:25:54,031 --> 01:25:59,031
you.
And you were the second baseman on our 

1840
01:25:59,031 --> 01:25:59,031
little softball.
Right?

1841
01:25:59,031 --> 01:26:02,520
But this is my friend Dan who is a comic
sub damn would

1842
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,770
be breaking down the universe,
but it's good to see you buddy.

1843
01:26:06,771 --> 01:26:07,300
Yeah,
that's good.

1844
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,420
What are you doing here?

1845
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,920
Um,
I'm running a showcase.

1846
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:14,921
I got this comedy festival that honors 
Johnny Carson in his hometown for comics

1847
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,990
were smart in town.
Norfork Nebraska.

1848
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:23,090
Whoa.
So he built this 1200 seat theater in 

1849
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,090
his hometown.
He loved it.

1850
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:25,800
And so to keep his name alive,
it's like the sixth year of it.

1851
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,370
It's pretty,
pretty top notch thing.

1852
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,160
Oh,
okay.

1853
01:26:28,161 --> 01:26:31,430
So you're here showcasing local 
comedians put them on that?

1854
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah.
This is my.

1855
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,850
Each night I go to a different city.
So I've been in Vancouver,

1856
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:36,260
Seattle,
San Francisco,

1857
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:37,550
Denver.

1858
01:26:37,551 --> 01:26:39,440
I Got Fort Lauderdale tomorrow.
Oh,

1859
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:41,390

So you guys isn't an 8:00

1860
01:26:41,391 --> 01:26:42,170

1861
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:43,820

Oh Great.

1862
01:26:43,821 --> 01:26:45,400
So it's going to start in 10 minutes.
Yeah,

1863
01:26:45,401 --> 01:26:46,820
and they said you were here.
I wanted to say hello.

1864
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,010
I'm good.
I'm happy to see you.

1865
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:54,070
I haven't seen you forever.
I know last time I saw you were at the 

1866
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,410
Improv for like two minutes in La.
I said,

1867
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:55,220
hey,
I just want to say,

1868
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:56,270
hey buddy,
you got to run.

1869
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:58,280
But before then I think it was like 
Boston.

1870
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,690
Yeah.
Lot Long,

1871
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:05,790
long time ago.
But I remember what I remember we were 

1872
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,250
playing softball all the time and having
a blast and the only.

1873
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:08,500
And there were a couple of guys who were
like,

1874
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:09,760
we'll take it seriously,
but you and I,

1875
01:27:09,761 --> 01:27:12,940
we would dance at first base,
second base.

1876
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:14,530
We would dance,
we would sing and people.

1877
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,240
Matt Graham would be like,
come on,

1878
01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:21,241
take it seriously.
I remember small group that's seen the 

1879
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:22,300
Rogan dancing machine danced my dick 
off,

1880
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,730
but remember Brian Frazier,
he was.

1881
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:28,870
He would get fucking huge argument.
You were out,

1882
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:30,790
you were out.
He made the fucking play.

1883
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,340
You were out.
Yeah.

1884
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,160
People are.
There's a Kagan playing third base

1885
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:38,990
that was fun times,
man,

1886
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:39,600
those,
uh,

1887
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,080
those days for,
we've,

1888
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:43,190
we've talked about them on the podcast a
million times,

1889
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:48,191
but when I started in 1988,
it was the most magical time in the 

1890
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:54,491
history of standup comedy.
I came along at the perfect moment and 

1891
01:27:54,491 --> 01:27:56,270
where Eddie was one of the headliners in
Boston already.

1892
01:27:56,271 --> 01:28:01,271
He was a couple of years ahead of me.
There were so many great comics in that 

1893
01:28:01,271 --> 01:28:01,850
area.
Is Kenny Rogers and alone?

1894
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:03,800
Yeah,
I mean Don Gavin,

1895
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:06,890
Steve Sweeney,
Lenny Clarke who was in Atlanta.

1896
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:08,540
Kevin,
meaning Kevin Knox.

1897
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:11,150
It was these killers,
killer comedians.

1898
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:12,650
There was.
So Mike Donovan,

1899
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,680
Goldthwaite and uh,
Tom Kenny.

1900
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,390
Yeah.
A few of those guys who left.

1901
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:22,470
And Steven right there was a,
there's a great documentary that a 

1902
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:27,000
friend,
his friend saw me to made this 

1903
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,621
documentary about that time and he's got
a lot of great old footage and they 

1904
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:32,150
really captured what had happened 
because it really fell apart.

1905
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:36,080
And if you go back to Boston now,
there's a few local comics.

1906
01:28:36,081 --> 01:28:41,081
There's a few guys that are still making
a living doing like the dicta already 

1907
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:43,991
comedy hots and local gigs in town,
but there's not this swarm of young 

1908
01:28:43,991 --> 01:28:45,420
talent like it was.
Well,

1909
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:50,490
when you.
That's why you now you go to Austin and 

1910
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:52,821
you know that's happening.
That's what I'm going there in March 

1911
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:55,310
because that's where the the comics are.
Yeah.

1912
01:28:55,311 --> 01:28:57,380
And then Seattle and.
Yeah,

1913
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:59,800
Austin's fantastic.
Denver to Margie Coil,

1914
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,080
she runs shit and

1915
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:07,100
Denver,
Wendy's place tuition every year for 

1916
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:11,661
this festival.
I at least get one or two people from 

1917
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:11,661
Denver,
so they're legit.

1918
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:15,620
They have a law.
That's one of the reasons that I lived 

1919
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:15,720
in Colorado for a little while.
They had a legit stand up community.

1920
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:21,030
I'm like,
I want to be a place where it's more 

1921
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,030
relaxed but also has real comedy and 
that's,

1922
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:22,200
that's.
There's only a few places,

1923
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:27,201
but Boston used to be the place,
but there's a kid named Rick Jenkins 

1924
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:30,921
member Rick,
when he runs this place in Boston and 

1925
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:33,981
Cambridge,
the Boston comedy studio or something 

1926
01:29:33,981 --> 01:29:33,981
like that.
It's in the Chinese restaurant.

1927
01:29:33,981 --> 01:29:38,331
Right.
And he's the one guy in Boston who's 

1928
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:38,331
really keeping that city alive.
So I go there and you know,

1929
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,260
when I do this festival,
I looked for people.

1930
01:29:40,261 --> 01:29:43,920
I go to the best comedy clubs in the 
best book or people like Margie Coil and

1931
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:48,921
say,
show me your 10 or 12 best people in 

1932
01:29:48,921 --> 01:29:48,921
there.

1933
01:29:48,921 --> 01:29:48,921
You know,
they make it easy for me.

1934
01:29:48,921 --> 01:29:48,960
Well that's awesome,
dude.

1935
01:29:48,961 --> 01:29:51,600
I'm glad you're doing that man,
because we need more,

1936
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:56,650
more young guys getting breaks and 
chances and there's a lot of them out 

1937
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:56,650
there.
People say,

1938
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:56,650
oh,
it's,

1939
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:58,200
there's nobody good.
But that's bullshit.

1940
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:03,350
Bullshit.
So many great young men and women that 

1941
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,350
are out there.
And I find them all the time and they're

1942
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:05,930
popping up more and more now I think 
because of these,

1943
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:06,870
uh,
you know,

1944
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,860
the Internet has created so many.
Like Bo Burnham says,

1945
01:30:09,861 --> 01:30:10,410
Sam.
Yeah.

1946
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,540
He became a star on the Internet.
You know,

1947
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,340
I met him once at one of these twitter 
functions.

1948
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:19,370
Super Nice Kid.
I met in Montreal and he just tore the 

1949
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:19,950
place apart.
Became famous because of the Internet.

1950
01:30:19,951 --> 01:30:21,870
Like literally someone found it and 
said,

1951
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:22,980
oh my God,
listen to this.

1952
01:30:22,981 --> 01:30:25,590
They sent it became viral boom,
next thing you know,

1953
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:27,630
the guy selling out theaters,
Justin Bieber,

1954
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,990
Justin Bieber,
he's really young.

1955
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:34,260
Ish.
She was 15 when he was first doing.

1956
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,130
He's a great guy.
It's,

1957
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:38,940
we live in beautiful times.
Really is.

1958
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:43,941
And so every year I find 20 people,
like I got drew Carey this year hosting 

1959
01:30:43,941 --> 01:30:48,171
and I always bring a legend like lily,
I had dicavid in these kinds of people 

1960
01:30:48,171 --> 01:30:52,520
and then I find 20 of the on the cusp 
people who were ready to rock and roll 

1961
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,780
and I bring them in and put them in a 
situation where they're all with great 

1962
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:57,390
comics who were smart so that they're 
all,

1963
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,370
they're forced to take it to the next 
level.

1964
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,710
And then they working with likeminded 
comic.

1965
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:02,760
They're not working with,
you know,

1966
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:04,680
some people who were kind of,
you know,

1967
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:07,010
taking the middle of the road or that 
kind of a hacky.

1968
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,040
Right.
So I went,

1969
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:09,330
you know,
I'm doing this audition tonight,

1970
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:10,310
and the guy said,
so,

1971
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:12,090
clean TB clinic,
go edgy,

1972
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:14,100
smart,
no milk toast.

1973
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:19,100
You know,
just like Johnny Carson would have had 

1974
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:19,100
it on his show.
Beautiful.

1975
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:23,550
If someone wants to be a part of this,
if you're not coming to their town,

1976
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:26,520
how can they get information on it or 
how to be a part of it next year?

1977
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:29,940
It's called the great American comedy 
festival and the only reason I came with

1978
01:31:29,941 --> 01:31:32,010
those words,
great America comedy,

1979
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,690
Johnny Carson,
Johnny Carson,

1980
01:31:33,691 --> 01:31:35,670
get in touch with me at [inaudible] dot 
com.

1981
01:31:35,671 --> 01:31:40,100
Write to me and I'll look at your link.
Is it an email address they can write to

1982
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,790
us?
Don't put it out there.

1983
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:44,940
They'll send you dick pics.
I got enough of those.

1984
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,710
Eventually.
Do on my own.

1985
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:48,870
I bet you.
All right man.

1986
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:54,050
Well thank you brother.
I just wanted to come say hi to know 

1987
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:54,050
that you're in the middle of it and know
it's so good to see you.

1988
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:54,420
Great to see you too,
man.

1989
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,310
I'm going to come after the podcast over
a combined saying.

1990
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:57,060
Alright,
sounds good.

1991
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:58,110
Nice to meet you.
Real pleasure.

1992
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,820
Alright,
Eddie Brown,

1993
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:04,830
ladies and gentlemen,
my son Dan is how brother see you later 

1994
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:10,060
on.
Alright,

1995
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,310
we'll see you guys.
Powerful Eddie,

1996
01:32:12,311 --> 01:32:17,311
Bro.
That's what it's like here in the Joe 

1997
01:32:17,311 --> 01:32:17,311
Rogan experience.
Occasionally people drop by.

1998
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,540
That's pretty cool though.
I liked how use doing that.

1999
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:24,310
Eddie was a,
it's always nice to run into people that

2000
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:27,150
were a cool to you when they didn't have
to be right,

2001
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,440
you know,
and he was uh,

2002
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:31,720
he was always nice to me,
like even back when I was a scrubbed men

2003
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,880
of character and he's just a good guy.
Yeah.

2004
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:37,120
So fun.
Happy Guy who really loves comedy,

2005
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:42,121
you know,
so it's cool seeing him do something 

2006
01:32:42,121 --> 01:32:43,681
like that man.
So are you still going to do some 

2007
01:32:43,681 --> 01:32:45,901
standup?
I heard you were putting together this 

2008
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:45,901
man.

2009
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:45,901
Oh man,
I gotta I got a few minutes ready.

2010
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:46,750
But it's,
it's rough.

2011
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:52,770
It's really rough.
I think my girlfriend is the only one 

2012
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:52,770
that's heard it.
She's,

2013
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:54,880
she's in the back and she's covered her 
eyes.

2014
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,810
She did one of those cat pictures or the
cats like,

2015
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:00,640
wow,
not this shit again,

2016
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:06,100
don't try any of my material and my wife
ever.

2017
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:10,300
Like sometimes I'll be writing something
down and she'll like,

2018
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:11,310
she'll go,
what are you writing down?

2019
01:33:11,311 --> 01:33:12,190
I'm like,
do you really want to hear it?

2020
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:12,880
And just like,
I don't know,

2021
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:14,200
do I really want to hear it?
I go,

2022
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:15,130
okay,
I'll tell you.

2023
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:16,780
Do you think this is funny,
you know,

2024
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:17,890
like that,
but I don't,

2025
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,300
I don't like try out shit on her.
People don't appreciate that.

2026
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:27,540
And then the other problem is then 
they've heard it already and then they 

2027
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:28,840
see you do it on stage and yeah.

2028
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:33,840
And they probably would laugh that way.
Whereas if they didn't know you were 

2029
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,080
going to do it,
like some people have said like they got

2030
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:40,320
upset at me because some of the stuff 
that was on my standup comedy special 

2031
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,450
with stuff that I initially said on the 
podcast and then like explored further,

2032
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:48,930
but that's part of my creative process.
I say something on the podcast and it's 

2033
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:49,240
really funny.
What am I supposed to do?

2034
01:33:49,241 --> 01:33:50,870
Just let that go.
No,

2035
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:55,140
I got to turn that bitch into a bit now.
But uh,

2036
01:33:55,141 --> 01:33:56,230
I.
well that's just like,

2037
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:58,960
or with gold pieces in it.
You've got to refine that down.

2038
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:01,420
Peurto yeah.
With stuff.

2039
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:04,750
And that's the weird thing about standup
comedy that people don't realize.

2040
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:06,940
It seems like a dude's just up there 
talking,

2041
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:09,820
but God damn,
there's a lot more to it than that.

2042
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,280
There's so much extra shit.

2043
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,410
It seems like one of the biggest 
challenges that I've ever.

2044
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,830
That's kind of what drew me to it is it 
seems so hard.

2045
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,960
You know,
I've done like debate speaking.

2046
01:34:19,961 --> 01:34:22,960
I've done large scale public speaking 
presentations,

2047
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,620
expressing ideas.
Not,

2048
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,880
not difficult for me for whatever my 
constitution is,

2049
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:30,250
but to actually go up there and have to 
make people laugh,

2050
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,260
I look at it and say,
I have no idea.

2051
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:36,850
I have no idea if this will cause a 
chuckle or they'll just be stone silent,

2052
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,260
you know?
Yeah.

2053
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:43,261
It's,
it's a funny art form because it's 

2054
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:47,140
everybody's capable of doing it in 
certain like small doses.

2055
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:52,470
Everybody's capable of doing it like at 
a party or amongst friends or you can 

2056
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:54,790
get a concept out that happens to be 
funny and,

2057
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,800
and a bunch of people laugh and that 
becomes very intoxicating,

2058
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:02,090
you know?
But the idea that you can go and address

2059
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:03,680
a bunch of people that don't even know 
you,

2060
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:09,610
that are expecting to laugh,
that paying money to sneak around the 

2061
01:35:09,610 --> 01:35:13,601
back and give them some landfill and 
they're looking for just the drink at 

2062
01:35:13,601 --> 01:35:16,661
some conversation.
But a good guy to talk to is Brian 

2063
01:35:16,661 --> 01:35:19,271
because Brian sort of got in on the 
cheat codes because Brian was stand up 

2064
01:35:19,271 --> 01:35:23,231
comedy because Brian,
when I first employed him wasn't doing 

2065
01:35:23,231 --> 01:35:24,590
comedy.
He had done comedy,

2066
01:35:24,591 --> 01:35:29,591
but he quit and he didn't do it for 
years and years and years and the day he

2067
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:34,991
went back and tried it again was during 
a UFC crowd in it Lanta on a fucking 

2068
01:35:38,601 --> 01:35:40,100
Friday night.
Okay.

2069
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:43,550
So it was a gangster and it was a 
midnight show

2070
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:47,030
and it's not like I had all my material 
remembered.

2071
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:52,031
It was like three,
four years ago since I've been on stage 

2072
01:35:52,031 --> 01:35:52,031
and I just had to go up on there.
Right.

2073
01:35:52,031 --> 01:35:56,240
I got only that.
They didn't know you yet because this 

2074
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:56,860
was pre podcast.
This was pre podcast.

2075
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,530
This was like,
now he has cheat codes.

2076
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:02,320
Now everybody knows who he is.
They know he's ridiculous.

2077
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:03,880
He goes out there and talks about coming
on.

2078
01:36:03,881 --> 01:36:05,970
People started laughing.
He said,

2079
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,500
there it is.
Say you

2080
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:15,400
about five years or something like that.
I can't watch it.

2081
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,820
Yeah,
he,

2082
01:36:18,821 --> 01:36:20,820
uh,
you didn't eat a dick,

2083
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:25,910
but you had several moments where you 
licked the shaft and put some balls in 

2084
01:36:26,011 --> 01:36:27,480
your mouth,
but you didn't,

2085
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:28,760
you didn't eat the deck,
you know,

2086
01:36:28,761 --> 01:36:31,260
I pulled out of it too.
Like that was one of the most impressive

2087
01:36:31,261 --> 01:36:36,261
things I've said that night because you 
had some moments where you did really 

2088
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:37,740
well and then you have a dropoff bad.
I was like,

2089
01:36:37,741 --> 01:36:39,120
oh no,
he's fucked.

2090
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:44,300
And that's the hardest thing is when 
they lose confidence in you and they're 

2091
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,040
not laughing to bring them back and only
imagine.

2092
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:46,980
Yeah,
it doesn't ever work in black crowds,

2093
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:48,900
black crowds.
Once you lose it,

2094
01:36:48,901 --> 01:36:53,901
you got to get off the stage and run.
You can't try to get it back because 

2095
01:36:53,901 --> 01:36:53,901
it's not coming back.

2096
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:57,680
Yeah.
I saw Brian Brian a couple years ago and

2097
01:36:57,681 --> 01:36:59,170
he was,
you were okay then,

2098
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:02,060
but I saw you in Austin and you were 
fucking good man.

2099
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:07,090
Thanks like I got to give you some 
prompts like you were seriously funny 

2100
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:07,090
there.
So it's been,

2101
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:07,460
it's been cool to see that

2102
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:10,690
he's got the cheat codes but he also has
a material too.

2103
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:11,670
He works at it.
He's,

2104
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:14,110
he's up tonight at the ice house,
but if you're going to do it,

2105
01:37:14,111 --> 01:37:14,470
man,

2106
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,980
you got to just jump in.
You to jump in.

2107
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,830
I'm thinking how much material have you 
written?

2108
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:25,880
Well,
I've timed myself and I have like a nine

2109
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:26,960
minute,
seven minute,

2110
01:37:26,961 --> 01:37:28,850
five minute,
kinda three minute.

2111
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:30,400
I've gotten that far so I know

2112
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:36,030
well that much.
If you have nine minutes you could 

2113
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:36,030
probably do five minutes.
Yeah.

2114
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:38,330
You need to.
Vegan material needs to be true.

2115
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,210
I'm sure.
Yes.

2116
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:42,590
But I have nothing to trim it by like I 
don't.

2117
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,270
It's funny.
So how do I turn that?

2118
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,200
That shit.
I got to just bomb a few times.

2119
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:51,230
Like,
Oh that sort of list you to read it to 

2120
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:51,980
yourself.
You got to listen.

2121
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:53,170
Like you know,
comedy,

2122
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:56,070
you've seen a lot of comedy shows.
You gotta able to sit there and

2123
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,330
like sort of listened to it yourself and
likes.

2124
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,720
But that's hard too,
because there's some shit.

2125
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:05,780
Sometimes I'll write something and I'll 
think it's funny and then I'll go on 

2126
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,730
stage and one part of it that I didn't 
think was funny is the funniest part.

2127
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:14,620
They're like howling laughing at this 
one observation and I thought that this 

2128
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:15,730
other part was the really funny part.
It's,

2129
01:38:15,731 --> 01:38:18,900
it's very,
it's comedy to this day is still.

2130
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:21,960
There's a lot of mystery involved in it.
There's a lot of.

2131
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,960
It's a lot of weirdness.
It's a strange art form.

2132
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:29,990
The challenging part for me at this 
point is just deciding on my tone 

2133
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:31,860
because there's almost a persona that 
you bring up there.

2134
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:36,861
It's you,
but it's you being a little bit more of 

2135
01:38:36,861 --> 01:38:38,250
this or that.
Like the type of energy you bring.

2136
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:43,251
Some comics are kind of laid back and 
they sneak the jokes in some more 

2137
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:45,270
intense and they bring a lot of energy 
into it.

2138
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:48,570
Your delivery style delivery stuff,
you know,

2139
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:52,350
you bring a lot of intensity generally 
in and it had crushed and killed.

2140
01:38:52,351 --> 01:38:53,930
But then you'll see somebody else who's 
Kinda,

2141
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:58,290
I guess like Mitch Hedberg or someone 
like that who's like really kind of cool

2142
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:01,250
planet and it's like,
I dunno,

2143
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:02,820
I don't know how to play my own 
material.

2144
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:04,380
That's wow.
That's a good point.

2145
01:39:04,381 --> 01:39:06,990
I've been doing it for so long.
I've sort of accepted the way I do it.

2146
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:10,500
You don't really enemy.
I very into like certain bits,

2147
01:39:10,501 --> 01:39:14,070
like certain bits or like more quiet 
than other bits which are more frenzied.

2148
01:39:14,071 --> 01:39:15,600
But I,
yeah.

2149
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:18,420
Now when I write material I write it for
my voice already.

2150
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:19,330
Nobody here that.
Okay.

2151
01:39:19,331 --> 01:39:19,980
Yeah,
it is.

2152
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:21,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

2153
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:26,180
This.
And there's no right way to do it 

2154
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:26,180
either,
man.

2155
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:26,180
And I've seen guys change.
That's weird.

2156
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:31,040
Weird.
When you see a guy who starts off and 

2157
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,661
he's sort of Jerry Seinfeld Dash,
and then somewhere along the line it 

2158
01:39:32,661 --> 01:39:33,330
becomes Dane Cook and you're like,
what happened here?

2159
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:35,190
Like you,
you like morphed man.

2160
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,000
They're just trying to find them.
My Shit's weird right now because I 

2161
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,550
start.
My new bits are more story based bits.

2162
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,630
And then I go into these long stories 
that have bits in it.

2163
01:39:45,631 --> 01:39:48,550
But then it goes into my older material,
which is more just like joke,

2164
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:49,220
joke,
joke,

2165
01:39:49,221 --> 01:39:49,710
joke,
joke,

2166
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,440
jokes per minute.
Where that's.

2167
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:53,910
Yeah,
well that's the evolution.

2168
01:39:53,911 --> 01:39:56,700
The evolution is you first start off,
I think,

2169
01:39:56,701 --> 01:40:01,701
uh,
you try to get things out of your mouth 

2170
01:40:01,701 --> 01:40:03,390
that are going to get laughs and you 
look at them as tools.

2171
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:05,250
Like there's this hammer work,
you know,

2172
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,630
you're just trying to get it to work.
That's the first stage.

2173
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,340
And then the second stage is,
well,

2174
01:40:11,341 --> 01:40:16,341
okay,
well what makes you laugh instead of 

2175
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:16,341
what makes them laugh?
What,

2176
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:16,341
what do you,
what do you know?

2177
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:18,780
What works instead of that,
what would make you laugh if you were in

2178
01:40:18,781 --> 01:40:19,470
the audience?

2179
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:24,710
And then the third stage is how do you 
get ideas across and point things out 

2180
01:40:24,871 --> 01:40:29,871
that you think are funny.
So like as you're moving through the 

2181
01:40:29,871 --> 01:40:30,480
stages,
the first is just sort of jokes and then

2182
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:35,690
it becomes jokes that you think are 
funny and then it becomes like things 

2183
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:35,850
that you're relating to different 
aspects of your life.

2184
01:40:35,851 --> 01:40:39,780
And there's like stages of the 
development of comedy.

2185
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:41,550
I fascinated.
I think for me,

2186
01:40:41,551 --> 01:40:46,551
the the thing that that may get me to 
actually do it is I feel like if I 

2187
01:40:46,551 --> 01:40:50,121
create interesting enough observations,
even if the comedy isn't quite up to 

2188
01:40:50,121 --> 01:40:51,330
mustard,
they'll come back and be like,

2189
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:56,360
Oh yeah,
that was interesting that he brought 

2190
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:56,360
that point up,
you know,

2191
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:56,360
which

2192
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:56,360
is probably kind of a backwards way to 
do it,

2193
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,700
but at least it's given me something to 
hang onto,

2194
01:40:57,740 --> 01:41:02,740
so if I fucking bomb I will at least 
make them aware of some shit they were 

2195
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,910
not aware of before.
Yeah.

2196
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:07,030
Well Bill Hicks out of that saying so 
even if you're not funny,

2197
01:41:07,031 --> 01:41:08,680
be interesting.
Yeah.

2198
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,640
Wow.
Wow.

2199
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,350
That's.
Sometimes it seems like it would work,

2200
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:14,080
but other times where you're on a date 
with your girlfriend,

2201
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:15,310
like,
let's laugh tonight.

2202
01:41:15,311 --> 01:41:20,311
I want to go out and fucking laugh,
and then you go do like a comedy show 

2203
01:41:20,311 --> 01:41:20,311
that's more like,
just interesting.

2204
01:41:20,311 --> 01:41:20,710
You'd probably be a little bit.

2205
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:22,300
You would be.
You would be.

2206
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:27,700
Yeah.
Especially the kind of tricks that you 

2207
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:30,490
bitches don't want to hear nothing.
They want to hear poopy farty jokes.

2208
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:34,200
Yeah.
No,

2209
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:34,990
it's a good point.
I mean,

2210
01:41:34,991 --> 01:41:36,580
sometimes people just want to,
um,

2211
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,180
they just want to fucking scales.
Yeah.

2212
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:43,770
Yeah.
Like sometimes you want to go see a 

2213
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:43,770
James Bond movie.
I don't give a fuck if it's realistic,

2214
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:43,990
you know,
by the way,

2215
01:41:43,991 --> 01:41:47,860
that last one wasn't realistic at all.
Far or whatever the fuck it was.

2216
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:50,530
Shit was ridiculous.
It was ridiculous.

2217
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:52,840
But that Daniel Craig guys the best 
James Bond.

2218
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,520
I agree.
He's way better than that.

2219
01:41:54,521 --> 01:41:55,900
Fucking Pierce Brosnan.
Cat.

2220
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,130
Yeah.
He was the worst.

2221
01:41:57,150 --> 01:42:02,150
A lot of these dynasties.
I think you're getting better batman 

2222
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,790
bond together tonight.
The new spider man.

2223
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:04,870
Fuck that.
Spiderman.

2224
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:06,580
Twilight,
Spiderman.

2225
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:11,320
That's why you like it.
I can't believe you're saying that.

2226
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,470
What's wrong with the news part of.

2227
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,140
I don't even remember.
I just remember I hated it.

2228
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,420
Is that the amazing spiderman?
The Lizard?

2229
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,350
I didn't see that.
I was confused.

2230
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:24,010
I was just used to toby.
I think tobey maguire is a good Peter 

2231
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,040
Parker and to make them all twilight.
He,

2232
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:25,840
I heard toby's ICAN.
Oh,

2233
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,840
I've heard it.
He's a good peer for her.

2234
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:31,380
Someone whose name rhymes with high end 
Helen,

2235
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,680
by the way,
Brian.

2236
01:42:36,681 --> 01:42:39,470
Kaylin will be with us this February 
first at Mandalay bay.

2237
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:42,590
Me already should fear Brian Callen 
Vegas socket.

2238
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,960
We're going to be at the Mandalay Bay 
events center.

2239
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:47,870
It's the same place where they do the 
ins and uh,

2240
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,800
it's going to be crazy.
Oh,

2241
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:50,960
big venue.
Biggest yet.

2242
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:53,330
Um,
it's pretty fucking big.

2243
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,700
It's big.
You know,

2244
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,850
it should be fun too because the Super 
Bowl weekend in Vegas.

2245
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:00,650
So we're supposed to be.
It was supposed to be Diaz,

2246
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,570
Diaz,
Diaz as an agent.

2247
01:43:02,571 --> 01:43:04,790
Now he's like someone that actually 
booking a place.

2248
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:06,880
So he says he's going to do things.
I can't do that.

2249
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:09,470
I forgot my fucking age is booked.
We somehow make Columbus.

2250
01:43:09,471 --> 01:43:11,420
I'm in this place.
He's a,

2251
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:14,060
he's got a lot.
He gets up at fucking 6:00

2252
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:19,150
in the morning to do his podcast.
It doesn't such a good idea from like 

2253
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:19,150
6:00
AM.

2254
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:23,090
You think that's a good idea for him?
He's always up.

2255
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:26,300
He's up.
I mean he gets up early and tweets,

2256
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:29,120
like in one hour I'm going to bed.
It's 5:00

2257
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:33,020
AM and he's tweeting and in one hour the
Church of what happened now is a star.

2258
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,200
That was the last time you saw 6:00
AM from that side,

2259
01:43:36,201 --> 01:43:36,470
Brian,

2260
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:40,690
about the backside flights never waking 
up.

2261
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:45,770
No,
not even that because they usually stay 

2262
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:45,770
awake for flights,

2263
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:46,220
so I don't think I've seen it in a long,
long time.

2264
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,720
Years.
Yeah.

2265
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:50,930
That's the Shit fucking existence.
Getting up at 6:00

2266
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:55,630
AM when you're not,
you're not totally done sleeping and you

2267
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,950
have to get up.
But for Joey he's done.

2268
01:43:58,010 --> 01:43:59,360
That's when he's done.
So weird.

2269
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:04,470
Yeah.
I've seen him do his podcast a couple 

2270
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:06,480
times,
but I was still like partying from the 

2271
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:06,480
night before.
He's wide awake too.

2272
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:07,650
It's crazy.
Gee,

2273
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,100
here's his.
A national anthem rant.

2274
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:11,720
Did you hear that?
Pull it up.

2275
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:15,740
Pull up Joey Diaz as national anthem 
because it's fucking hilarious.

2276
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:18,260
He was high as fuck.
It's 6:00

2277
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:21,980
AM going off about the national anthem.
It's beautiful.

2278
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:27,790
That's a.
that's a a guy who could change the 

2279
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:27,790
world.
He needs to be a court jester.

2280
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:36,760
Let's try to get the guy to play the 
national anthem because listen to how 

2281
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:40,380
high his voices.
What is this shit?

2282
01:44:40,381 --> 01:44:42,590
What is this evening at the fucking 
pops?

2283
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:46,200
There's a bunch of gay guys,
but the national anthem with the Marines

2284
01:44:46,201 --> 01:44:50,400
and people shoot people.
What is this shit with the flag?

2285
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,630
You got a bunch of like gay marines 
playing that shit that trump.

2286
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:59,450
If I had a knife,
I would throw them at you.

2287
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:04,620
Listened to be alive.
Cocksuckers get up.

2288
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:07,140
This is one of the planes on the video.
It looks like it should be okay.

2289
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:15,740
Stop badmouthing your country and shit.
Fuck this shit.

2290
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,670
I'm sick and fucking tired of hearing 
all this shit at this.

2291
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:26,680
No jobs at this best you want to go to.
I'm sick and tired of the APP and Zbb 

2292
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:33,220
erectile dysfunction.
Get the fuck up yourself in the mirror 

2293
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:37,230
you,
but that you in American people are 

2294
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:42,260
crying like a fucking pussy.
You're a fucking American.

2295
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:47,830
Get bullied.
People coming in because what happened 

2296
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:50,531
to the stupid kids in the back of the 
class and shop teachers get guns.

2297
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:57,080
I want everybody with a fucking gun.
You gotta protect yourself.

2298
01:45:57,410 --> 01:46:01,280
You leave here with a fucking slingshot.
I'm 50 fucking years old.

2299
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:08,180
You're a fucking American.
Stop your crying.

2300
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,640
Fuck the NRA.
Just get a gun.

2301
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:12,740
Get a BB gun,
get a knife.

2302
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:17,900
Get up and stop complaining.
You're a fucking American.

2303
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:25,510
That's what they should play at school.

2304
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:27,480
Not that pledge of allegiance.
Bullshit.

2305
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:30,120
Fifty cent and Joey Diaz coining the 
term.

2306
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:30,980
Get up.
Yeah,

2307
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:33,230
to get Joyce's better.
It's realistic.

2308
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,790
He's just trying to fuck white chicks.
I know what's going on.

2309
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:40,020
Probably really successful.
Especially with all that vitamin.

2310
01:46:40,021 --> 01:46:42,150
Water money.
Did you ever see that shit that happened

2311
01:46:42,151 --> 01:46:43,200
with him?
Floyd Mayweather.

2312
01:46:43,201 --> 01:46:46,120
They had a fake feud online.
No,

2313
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:48,240
I saw in the 24 slash seven that they 
were boys though.

2314
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:50,070
I lost so much respect for them for

2315
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:55,070
that.
They had a fake twitter feud where they 

2316
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:56,991
pretended to be angry with each other to
get attention because they were trying 

2317
01:46:56,991 --> 01:46:57,390
to.
I don't know what they're trying to pump

2318
01:46:57,391 --> 01:47:02,391
up.
I don't know what a floyd's upcoming 

2319
01:47:02,391 --> 01:47:02,391
fights are.
What the fuck.

2320
01:47:02,391 --> 01:47:06,111
The idea behind it was,
but a fake twitter feud between floyd 

2321
01:47:06,111 --> 01:47:07,330
and 50.
So much as opposed

2322
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,840
so much of that rap game is so much 
image though too,

2323
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:10,470
you know,
it's,

2324
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:15,760
they're just really putting on something
50 is actually one thing I do respect 

2325
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,971
about him is he actually wrote a book 
with Robert Greene called the 50th law 

2326
01:47:19,971 --> 01:47:23,540
and in it he's very honest about his 
calculating business approach to 

2327
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:25,230
creating a persona that's going to sell.
Well,

2328
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:26,220
you know,
he doesn't,

2329
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:31,250
he doesn't party.
He doesn't do all the shit he talks 

2330
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:31,250
about,
you know,

2331
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:31,290
sitting in the club with a bottle above.
He's not doing that shit.

2332
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,120
He's back writing.
He's plotting,

2333
01:47:33,121 --> 01:47:36,180
he's planning,
he's very calculated in what he does and

2334
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:38,010
when he talks he talks honestly about 
that.

2335
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:40,650
But to see him do some kind of public 
feud,

2336
01:47:40,651 --> 01:47:41,150
it's just seems

2337
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,180
cheap.
Seems a little cheap.

2338
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:46,000
Stupid Hammond,
floyd mayweather getting together.

2339
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,520
I mean aren't you guys both worth like a
billion bucks?

2340
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:53,610
Fucking you fucking done like a couple 
of girls having a fake twitter feud.

2341
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:56,350
They probably watched beverly hills 
housewives land,

2342
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:58,790
man.
We need to get that strategy.

2343
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,590
They want to create some real drama.
Get Floyd to fight fucking pack.

2344
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:01,870
Yeah.

2345
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,790
Not Anymore.
Not Anymore sailed.

2346
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,830
Yeah.
That's sad.

2347
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:09,830
That one Marquez punched.
Just changed,

2348
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:13,580
changed everything to punches the one 
that he knocked them down with earlier.

2349
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:16,220
That changes a little bit,
but the end one,

2350
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,940
the big one to put them away.
That was probably the most violent we've

2351
01:48:19,941 --> 01:48:24,941
ever seen a hero get knocked out because
the Tyson knockout was a beat down,

2352
01:48:24,951 --> 01:48:28,270
but he was conscious and he was moving 
around trying to grab his mouthpiece and

2353
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,680
you know,
the referee rescued him.

2354
01:48:29,681 --> 01:48:31,100
He was standing up,
you know,

2355
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:36,340
like the.
If you look at like all the various 

2356
01:48:36,921 --> 01:48:41,540
times that someone was a hero and they 
got beat like in the prime,

2357
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:45,710
that was the most violent.
A Guy just got completely starts.

2358
01:48:45,711 --> 01:48:49,220
The second one would be Roy Jones jr 
when we fought Glenn Johnson,

2359
01:48:49,221 --> 01:48:52,150
but by then he had already been knocked 
out one time.

2360
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:54,860
He wasn't,
he didn't have that invincible.

2361
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:55,430
Eric.
Yeah.

2362
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,270
He'd already gotten knocked out by a 
Fox.

2363
01:48:59,271 --> 01:49:03,890
His name to do that.
A handsome black guy.

2364
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:05,900
Fuck is his name.

2365
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,290
I don't recall.
It makes it.

2366
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:13,310
Makes me wonder if that,
if that very questionable lost that 

2367
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:16,270
Pacquiao had had some impact on a 
psychology when he was going out there,

2368
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:21,450
like he was a little more aggressive or 
something that he was really trying to 

2369
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:23,020
prove that he wasn't going to leave it 
in the judge's hands.

2370
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,290
Antonio Tarver Antonio Guy.
Um,

2371
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:31,480
yeah.
I think that could have something to do 

2372
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:34,841
with them.
And sometimes a fighter just has your 

2373
01:49:34,841 --> 01:49:34,841
number now.
There's sometimes like they will,

2374
01:49:34,841 --> 01:49:36,270
you know,
there's that thing that they say style,

2375
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:39,200
make fights,
makes fights and everybody says,

2376
01:49:39,201 --> 01:49:40,250
oh,
that's a cliche.

2377
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:43,340
And it Kinda is a cliche,
but it kind of is true too.

2378
01:49:43,341 --> 01:49:45,920
There's some guys that just have a guy's
number.

2379
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:51,420
Vernon forrest with sugar.
Shane Mosley Vernon forrest just had 

2380
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:51,810
sugar.
Shane's number.

2381
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:56,020
Just knew he knew how to beat him.
He could beat him and sugar.

2382
01:49:56,021 --> 01:50:01,021
Shane would beat more guys in Vernon 
would be if they both fought like the 

2383
01:50:01,021 --> 01:50:04,891
same guys.
Sugar Shane would win more than Vernon 

2384
01:50:04,891 --> 01:50:04,891
would win.
But when they got together Vernon,

2385
01:50:04,891 --> 01:50:07,450
one twice and the way he wanted it 
didn't look like sugar.

2386
01:50:07,451 --> 01:50:12,451
Shane was ever going to beat him.
It looked like he just had his number 

2387
01:50:12,451 --> 01:50:15,600
and that's a strange thing with fighting
and with fighting the way mark has and 

2388
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,750
pack all lined up,
man.

2389
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:22,080
They were just so God damn close.
There's like what his strengths were 

2390
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:26,230
sorta overcame what pack strengths were 
and what Pascal strengths were,

2391
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:31,440
were adjusted enough to edge by.
Mark has two in two different fights 

2392
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,150
that Mark Marquez could take a fucking 
punch though.

2393
01:50:34,151 --> 01:50:39,151
That's one of the reasons why he's 
always still in the game because he can 

2394
01:50:39,151 --> 01:50:39,520
take a punch and then fire back with his
own shit.

2395
01:50:39,521 --> 01:50:42,160
Whereas a lot of guys got overwhelmed by
pack power,

2396
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:44,950
enhance speed Marquez could take it,
man.

2397
01:50:44,951 --> 01:50:47,320
He could take it.
So that made him like extra day.

2398
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:52,380
I wonder what that is.
I've tried to talk to the neurosurgeon 

2399
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:52,380
that we have working with on it about 
that.

2400
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:56,320
You know what it is about an individual 
that allows them to take a punch.

2401
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:57,800
It's pretty interesting,
you know,

2402
01:50:57,950 --> 01:51:01,060
like what makes the short circuit easier
happened,

2403
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:02,020
you know,
the weak chin,

2404
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:02,710
I would imagine.

2405
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:05,230
It's a combination of experience,
experience,

2406
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,640
structure,
structures,

2407
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:11,950
big guys like Mark Hunt who was 
legendary for his ability to take 

2408
01:51:11,950 --> 01:51:13,390
punches,
cabbage who is legendary for his ability

2409
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:15,760
to take punches,
big giant heads.

2410
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:21,060
You know,
both those guys that just big giant 

2411
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:23,371
fucking iron heads,
but then there's all get some smaller 

2412
01:51:23,371 --> 01:51:27,091
Mexican box.
There's a lot of Mexicans that really 

2413
01:51:27,091 --> 01:51:29,611
good chin,
some reason not to generalize but just 

2414
01:51:29,611 --> 01:51:31,660
seems like that's part of the program 
and then some of those lighter weights I

2415
01:51:31,661 --> 01:51:36,661
think with a lot of Mexicans would.
It is also is a certain amount of your 

2416
01:51:37,331 --> 01:51:42,331
ability to take punishment is your 
desire to win and your drive and your 

2417
01:51:42,331 --> 01:51:46,561
heart and Mexican fighters have always 
been known for their heart and their 

2418
01:51:46,561 --> 01:51:50,071
toughness and endurance.
Your ability to withstand a shot and 

2419
01:51:50,071 --> 01:51:50,071
come back because you're in shape and 
you recover.

2420
01:51:50,071 --> 01:51:54,930
That's big,
but Mexican fighters have always been 

2421
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:57,541
known for their willingness to scrap and
further their ability to take a shot and

2422
01:51:58,301 --> 01:51:58,960
come back.

2423
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:01,180
Yeah,
and I think a lot of that has to be like

2424
01:52:01,181 --> 01:52:02,800
a desire,
a drive,

2425
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:05,020
and you're like,
they're proud of their ability to like.

2426
01:52:05,021 --> 01:52:07,660
They're not pussies,
just overwhelming will.

2427
01:52:07,661 --> 01:52:09,610
They don't want any way out.
No way,

2428
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,490
no way out.
Now looking for a way to.

2429
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:14,830
When you look at the great Mexican 
boxers that embodied that,

2430
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:16,630
like Julio Cesar Chavez.
Yeah.

2431
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:19,990
Chavez in his prime was was that 
personified?

2432
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:25,170
He would bite Donna's mouthpiece and the
bell would ring and he was coming after 

2433
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:26,350
you and he wasn't thinking about whether
or not he was gonna win.

2434
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:28,060
It was.
He was definitely going to win.

2435
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,770
It was just going to beat your fucking 
ass.

2436
01:52:29,771 --> 01:52:30,670
You know,
he was going to India,

2437
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:31,850
you're hitting them hanging,
hang them,

2438
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:36,870
handle meldrick.
Taylor and him fought for 12 fucking 

2439
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:40,171
hard browns and with 10 seconds to go 
and the twelfth he drops Meldrick Taylor

2440
01:52:41,170 --> 01:52:42,280
and they stopped the fight.

2441
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:44,290
I mean,
it was ridiculous.

2442
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:49,291
Like he was looking for a way out.
He was always trying to win and he was 

2443
01:52:49,291 --> 01:52:50,030
legendary and his ability to take a 
shot.

2444
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:55,330
But then again,
frankie randall came around and had 

2445
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:58,121
Chavez number,
whereas he just had this fucking 

2446
01:52:58,121 --> 01:52:58,121
powerful straight,
right.

2447
01:52:58,121 --> 01:53:02,170
He knew how to land it and boom,
all of a sudden Chavez was down and 

2448
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:02,170
everybody's like,
wow.

2449
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:05,210
And he beat him twice and it was one of 
those things where it's like,

2450
01:53:05,211 --> 01:53:07,760
this is just a dude that has his number.
He knows,

2451
01:53:07,761 --> 01:53:12,761
he knows how to beat him.
It's just weird how like how much you 

2452
01:53:12,771 --> 01:53:16,760
know stylistically how much that factors
in to certain fights.

2453
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:22,250
Like there's certain guys where you 
could see them fight the same dude 100 

2454
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:25,370
times and they're never going to beat 
that guy and that guy breaks his hand or

2455
01:53:25,870 --> 01:53:28,760
slipped a disc in the middle of a fight.
You're not going to beat him.

2456
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:30,040
He's going to beat you.
Right?

2457
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:33,890
Then there's Anderson Silva.
This is fucking guys were.

2458
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:33,980
You

2459
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:38,990
can't figure it out.
Anybody that's ever going to beat him 

2460
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:41,650
that.
That was one of the more mindblowing 

2461
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:41,650
sports events.
There's been a couple of my life,

2462
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:42,440
but seeing him going to Brazil,
Brazil,

2463
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:46,220
rob came with me to Brazil.
We were ringside right there.

2464
01:53:46,221 --> 01:53:51,221
While that fight happened,
to see him do that is just just blew 

2465
01:53:51,221 --> 01:53:51,230
your mind.
I mean,

2466
01:53:51,231 --> 01:53:54,170
I've seen him do amazing things,
pinpoint strikes,

2467
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:55,820
you know,
great maneuvers.

2468
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:58,550
But the way he just did that,
just saying,

2469
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:00,680
I don't care,
I'm going to put myself,

2470
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:01,660
you know,
he,

2471
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:04,940
he got,
he dodged that spinning back,

2472
01:54:04,941 --> 01:54:06,080
kick it,
hit the fence,

2473
01:54:06,081 --> 01:54:08,270
and then he goes right back where that 
kick landed.

2474
01:54:08,271 --> 01:54:08,810
Like,
okay,

2475
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:10,760
I mean you miss me there,
but I'm gonna stand right here.

2476
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:12,050
And then just slip them.
Oh my God,

2477
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:14,870
God.
It was what he was like operating on.

2478
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:20,390
Not just one level but several levels 
faster than Stephan Bonner where he 

2479
01:54:21,861 --> 01:54:26,861
could just move away from anything 
bonded through any punch that he threw 

2480
01:54:26,861 --> 01:54:27,920
he could roll with.
It's like he,

2481
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:32,060
he had such faith in his reflexes and 
his skill of,

2482
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:37,120
of defense and avoiding things that he 
literally backed his body up to the cage

2483
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:40,270
and allowed to do to throw shots at him.
I've never seen,

2484
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:41,480
never seen that.
Never.

2485
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:44,870
And then when he decided to,
when he stopped the fight,

2486
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:48,710
like almost immediately slammed a knee 
into a solar plexus.

2487
01:54:48,711 --> 01:54:51,860
And the fights over and he just like,
Holy Shit.

2488
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:55,680
You have to imagine that was the same 
place that these legendary wars.

2489
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:58,190
We've talked about Masashi before,
but that print,

2490
01:54:58,191 --> 01:55:02,300
that place of no mind that I've been 
actually reading a book,

2491
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:07,301
which was a crazy radical book.
I don't even know if we want to get 

2492
01:55:07,301 --> 01:55:07,301
into.
It's called zero limits.

2493
01:55:07,301 --> 01:55:10,900
But one good thing about it is it talks 
about getting to a zero state in the 

2494
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:13,340
zero state is where there's no thought,
no emotion,

2495
01:55:13,341 --> 01:55:18,341
no anything else.
The only thing left to come to you is 

2496
01:55:18,341 --> 01:55:18,341
inspiration,
you know,

2497
01:55:18,341 --> 01:55:20,780
but for an athlete,
the zero state I think is the zone,

2498
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:25,830
you know,
it's where there's absolutely nothing 

2499
01:55:25,830 --> 01:55:25,830
interfering with your training and your 
instincts.

2500
01:55:25,830 --> 01:55:28,250
Yeah.
And he just taps into that completely.

2501
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:30,290
So you know,
his impulses are just right.

2502
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:33,590
There's no nothing blocking what he 
knows how to do.

2503
01:55:33,591 --> 01:55:36,650
And he's trained himself to be the best 
already physically.

2504
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:39,500
And then mentally he's impeccable.
You're

2505
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:43,540
so confident now too.
It's like with every fight that he's won

2506
01:55:43,541 --> 01:55:48,541
in the octagon,
he's like slowly moved his way into 

2507
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:52,341
where he's at now,
which is like this almost unreachable 

2508
01:55:52,341 --> 01:55:54,831
frequency.
I like all these people that are trying 

2509
01:55:54,831 --> 01:55:54,831
to get to his title.
You look at them and you're like,

2510
01:55:54,831 --> 01:55:56,260
really?
You really want a shot?

2511
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:01,280
That guy cause I'm looking at the way 
you move and I look at the way he moves 

2512
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:04,821
and I'm like,
I don't think you can move the way he 

2513
01:56:04,821 --> 01:56:04,821
moves and he's going to fuck you up.
You know,

2514
01:56:04,821 --> 01:56:04,821
and you know,
they,

2515
01:56:04,821 --> 01:56:06,120
they,
a lot of them are talking good.

2516
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:11,150
You know,
they're saying they want to get a piece 

2517
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:12,501
at Anderson.
They wanna get a piece of that and then 

2518
01:56:12,501 --> 01:56:12,501
you'll see them lose to some contender 
along the way and you're like,

2519
01:56:12,501 --> 01:56:13,530
listen man,
you got lucky.

2520
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:18,590
You lucky you avoided that execution 
because the kind of execution that 

2521
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:21,921
Anderson gives you is one of those 
retirement executions where you just 

2522
01:56:21,921 --> 01:56:22,410
step into ego.
Stephen Bond,

2523
01:56:22,411 --> 01:56:27,411
after that fight was flying back with 
Dana White and he said he was just 

2524
01:56:27,411 --> 01:56:28,830
shaking his head going,
no one's ever done that to me before.

2525
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,980
I've never seen anybody do that.
I didn't think anybody could do that.

2526
01:56:32,230 --> 01:56:33,690
Was like,
no one's ever done that to me before.

2527
01:56:33,691 --> 01:56:36,720
That was humbling.
It was like the guy's an alien,

2528
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:38,200
you know,
and that,

2529
01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:41,700
that kind of devastation that Anderson 
can put on you.

2530
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:47,510
You look at the mountain ahead of 
climbing to get to the level of 

2531
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:50,880
proficiency that you saw him exhibit on 
you and you go,

2532
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:53,010
well,
I can't get there.

2533
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:54,690
I did.
My body doesn't move like that.

2534
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:58,980
There's certain physical limitations 
that certain people are just.

2535
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:04,070
They just have and certain fiscal 
advantages that some people just have 

2536
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:06,900
like a guy like Jon Jones or you look at
a guy like Kevin around them and when he

2537
01:57:06,901 --> 01:57:11,901
was in his prime,
he's one of my favorites as far as like 

2538
01:57:11,901 --> 01:57:12,720
unbelievable athleticism and speed and 
power.

2539
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:14,840
Kevin Randleman when he was in his prime
was just a.

2540
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:17,100
his nickname was the monster.
It was a perfect nickname.

2541
01:57:17,101 --> 01:57:19,650
He was a jump up in both of his legs,
up in the air.

2542
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:23,580
It was so scary.
It was such a fucking athlete and if you

2543
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:28,560
don't have that kind of athleticism,
you are never going to be able to do the

2544
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:31,110
stuff that he can do.
You can't move the way he moves,

2545
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:34,680
you just can't.
And if a guy like Kevin Randleman who is

2546
01:57:34,681 --> 01:57:39,681
this incredible athlete,
dedicates himself and learns the 

2547
01:57:39,681 --> 01:57:44,001
techniques that I like,
Anderson Silva learns and gets to that 

2548
01:57:44,001 --> 01:57:48,051
level proficiency and timing and 
confidence that Anderson Silva has and 

2549
01:57:48,051 --> 01:57:52,491
then another guy tries to get there but 
doesn't have the same body as Kevin 

2550
01:57:52,491 --> 01:57:57,290
Randleman.
He won't be able to compete with Kevin 

2551
01:57:57,290 --> 01:57:57,290
Randleman.
It's just there's,

2552
01:57:57,290 --> 01:57:59,760
there's certain,
there's the roll of the dice is not even

2553
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:05,150
everybody gets a different hand of cards
and some people get to twos and some 

2554
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:06,330
people like John Jones get four aces,
you know,

2555
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:07,800
and it's,
it's a weird thing,

2556
01:58:07,801 --> 01:58:09,660
but that's just the way it is.

2557
01:58:09,970 --> 01:58:13,620
Seems like he's epitomized the body type
for mma.

2558
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:15,360
You understand that Jon Jones?
Well,

2559
01:58:15,361 --> 01:58:16,590
both are long,
long.

2560
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,000
You know,
you find that for now you see it in 

2561
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:23,000
basketball,
you see it,

2562
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,960
the sports have kind of created a body 
type that's ideal.

2563
01:58:24,961 --> 01:58:28,860
And I think with them you're seeing it 
exemplified that extra length,

2564
01:58:28,861 --> 01:58:31,830
that extra snap reaches huge,
huge.

2565
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:32,610
Uh,
you know,

2566
01:58:32,611 --> 01:58:33,840
I,
I've always been short.

2567
01:58:33,841 --> 01:58:37,050
So for me,
fighting tall guys was always an issue.

2568
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:42,110
It was always like,
was always like another thing that 

2569
01:58:42,110 --> 01:58:42,110
you're fighting.
Trying to get.

2570
01:58:42,110 --> 01:58:42,110
Trying to get close to them.
Yeah.

2571
01:58:42,110 --> 01:58:42,110
You

2572
01:58:42,110 --> 01:58:42,460
know,
and,

2573
01:58:42,461 --> 01:58:47,461
and developing timing.
The thing about shorter guys don't like 

2574
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:52,670
guys like Tyson showed that there's a 
certain amount of benefit to pink shorts

2575
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:58,440
because they can unload these ridiculous
combinations in fast close quarters 

2576
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:01,240
where you can't sort of like the,
the tall,

2577
01:59:01,241 --> 01:59:06,241
gangly person can't really deal with it,
but the length of their arms actually 

2578
01:59:06,241 --> 01:59:08,680
becomes a disadvantage in mma.
You see that with Hector Lombard,

2579
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:13,920
who's a fascinating specimen because 
he's not just this ridiculous power 

2580
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,700
puncher,
but he's also this massive,

2581
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:19,240
massively talented judo guy with giant 
muscles.

2582
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:23,500
So it's like he's this crusher who also 
has like the CIC grappling as well.

2583
01:59:23,501 --> 01:59:25,930
So he's not worried about you taking 
them down because most likely you're not

2584
01:59:25,931 --> 01:59:28,270
going to.
So he's trying to close the distance and

2585
01:59:28,271 --> 01:59:33,271
drop bombs on you.
Did you see that fight with him and who 

2586
01:59:33,271 --> 01:59:33,271
some are porous?
No,

2587
01:59:33,271 --> 01:59:33,280
I missed that one.

2588
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:35,560
Oh killer.
What?

2589
01:59:35,561 --> 01:59:37,570
Paul Harris is built just like A.
Yeah,

2590
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:40,270
just like he is.
So Lombard is like five,

2591
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:45,300
seven,
185 pounds of solid muscle as is 

2592
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:45,300
[inaudible].
They're both like the same size.

2593
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:49,150
They're all built the same way,
but Paul Harris can't crack the way that

2594
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:54,180
hector lumbar can crack.
So Hector Lara just teed off on him and 

2595
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:55,140
stopped him.
But the.

2596
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,670
There's an advantage to that sort of 
body type,

2597
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:02,700
that Hector Lombard style body type,
but I think there's a bigger advantage 

2598
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:05,170
to the John Jones Anderson Silva type,
but they're always be room for Tyson.

2599
02:00:05,171 --> 02:00:07,720
Tyson created himself into an 
unstoppable force.

2600
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:12,960
You know,
watching him train the old tyson 

2601
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:15,031
training videos are awesome.
Just how he would perfect that torque 

2602
02:00:15,031 --> 02:00:18,361
and that slip and then movement.
It was like uncorking the most powerful 

2603
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:23,400
force from the ground,
like every part of his muscles working 

2604
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:26,191
together.
When he was throwing those hooks and 

2605
02:00:26,191 --> 02:00:26,191
upper cuts,
the way his body was moving,

2606
02:00:26,191 --> 02:00:28,530
he made himself into an unstoppable 
force for awhile and then you know,

2607
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:31,600
that petered out,
but somebody could still do that.

2608
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:36,310
There was also the intensity to his 
delivery that we had never seen before.

2609
02:00:36,570 --> 02:00:41,570
Then the Tyson era before Tyson,
we were looking at guys like Tony tubs 

2610
02:00:41,570 --> 02:00:42,770
and Pink Land Thomas and really like,
you know,

2611
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:44,470
I don't want to say this with any 
disrespect,

2612
02:00:44,471 --> 02:00:46,300
but there's no other way to say it.
They were,

2613
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:49,390
they were lazy.
They were just guys who were just.

2614
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:49,970
They,
they,

2615
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:53,740
they really had no business being at the
top of the heap in any other sport.

2616
02:00:53,770 --> 02:00:58,770
They wouldn't have been.
They wouldn't have been at the top of 

2617
02:00:58,770 --> 02:01:00,751
the heap in basketball like pink,
pink and Thomas wouldn't have been an 

2618
02:01:00,751 --> 02:01:01,570
all star nfl running back.
He didn't have that kind of discipline.

2619
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:06,840
He wasn't that kind of fighter,
but Tyson was so he came along in this 

2620
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:11,341
era,
people who were slacking and here's a 

2621
02:01:11,341 --> 02:01:11,440
guy who it in work with me.
I get up at 5:00

2622
02:01:11,441 --> 02:01:14,510
in the morning and do my jogging and the
reason why I do my running at that time,

2623
02:01:14,511 --> 02:01:16,810
it's because I know that no one else has
the awake at that time.

2624
02:01:17,230 --> 02:01:20,020
I remember him saying that and he will 
give me an extra inch.

2625
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:24,160
I don't remember like thinking like this
guy is trying to get edges everywhere he

2626
02:01:24,161 --> 02:01:29,161
can.
He's getting up earlier than anybody 

2627
02:01:29,161 --> 02:01:30,670
running and he seemed running in the 
dark and he just looked like a muscle,

2628
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:34,120
just like a corded muscle.
He was.

2629
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:36,880
He was built like unlike any heavyweight
before him,

2630
02:01:36,881 --> 02:01:39,860
except like he was like a bigger version
of like Joe Frazier,

2631
02:01:39,861 --> 02:01:40,040
like

2632
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,230
a much more muscular version of Joe 
Frazier,

2633
02:01:42,231 --> 02:01:44,960
but much faster,
much faster,

2634
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:46,880
you know,
like his,

2635
02:01:46,881 --> 02:01:50,030
his ability to deliver punches.
Like with speed,

2636
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:52,280
like there's a video of him hitting the 
heavy bag.

2637
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:57,730
It's one of the most ridiculous things 
you've ever seen in your life because 

2638
02:01:57,730 --> 02:02:00,521
he's hitting it like a flyweight.
No heavyweights did that at the time.

2639
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,410
No one unleashed those kinds of like 
five,

2640
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:06,140
six punch combinations in satellite.
Two seconds.

2641
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:11,530
He was a,
he was the guy who came along and just 

2642
02:02:11,530 --> 02:02:11,780
said,
everybody's operating at 70 Rpms.

2643
02:02:11,781 --> 02:02:13,190
Okay,
I'm going to go to a thousand.

2644
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:15,330
See if he can keep up.
Good luck.

2645
02:02:15,331 --> 02:02:16,610
Go,
come get me.

2646
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:20,330
Have you seen some of those videos of 
like really young kids doing mma now?

2647
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:22,490
That's pretty dope.
Yeah.

2648
02:02:22,491 --> 02:02:27,491
This is two twins out of Vegas and uh,
I've seen them hit the paths and stuff 

2649
02:02:27,491 --> 02:02:31,550
and when I saw them they were like five 
and I think they're probably about 10 or

2650
02:02:31,551 --> 02:02:34,130
more,
might be maybe 12 even now.

2651
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:38,120
So they're approaching teenage years,
which will be here before you know it.

2652
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:41,850
And then there'll be men and these guys,
they started out there.

2653
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:44,870
They're a body has developed moving like
that.

2654
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:46,690
Their bodies developed throwing up,
you know,

2655
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:51,410
just effortless armbars and throwing 
combinations and leg kicks and shit.

2656
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:56,620
And their parents are super dedicated.
Their parents take them to the gym all 

2657
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:59,921
the time and they're always there with 
them and supporting them is pretty 

2658
02:02:59,921 --> 02:03:00,120
fucking wild there in that tap out 
commercial.

2659
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,790
You ever seen that commercial with the 
two kids?

2660
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:02,660
I haven't seen it,
no.

2661
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:05,620
Let me see if I can find online because 
it's pretty wild.

2662
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:08,600
Just seeing the youtube stuff is crazy 
impressive.

2663
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:11,930
Oh yeah.
And that's what Roy Mcdonald Man,

2664
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:12,810
these,
um,

2665
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:17,900
these guys that are coming up now.
I'm Brian,

2666
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:22,930
go to a Rufo brothers commercial r u f,
f o Rufo brothers commercial.

2667
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:31,630
This is um,
this is a commercial that they have for 

2668
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:32,380
tap out and you see these little kids,
they have a,

2669
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:38,200
they have Mohawks and they're throwing 
punches and kicks in the air and it's,

2670
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:40,580
it's,
it's pretty wild looking at it.

2671
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:43,100
It's like everything they're doing,
they do it perfectly.

2672
02:03:43,101 --> 02:03:45,800
They're hitting the pads and they're 
hitting them perfectly.

2673
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:48,500
Throwing kicks,
taking people down,

2674
02:03:48,501 --> 02:03:50,300
doing duck unders and shit.
And they like,

2675
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:53,840
their body is like developing,
learning all these skills.

2676
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:56,540
And in the video Mark Coleman is 
coaching them.

2677
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:00,050
Take downs.
This one?

2678
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:03,150
Yeah,
this is a good.

2679
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,350
This is it.
Good smoothies.

2680
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,540
These little kids,
man.

2681
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,840
I mean these are like babies.
They look like they're like five and 

2682
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:12,380
they're getting coaching by rest.
His soul.

2683
02:04:12,381 --> 02:04:14,180
Sean Tompkins,
the background,

2684
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:19,130
one of the great mma coaches of all time
who recently died.

2685
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:24,140
Great guy like he's ducking under there.
Like this guy is holding the pads for.

2686
02:04:24,141 --> 02:04:25,780
I'm look at mark.
That's the hammer bitch.

2687
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:30,790
That's Mark Coleman motherfucker.
He's teaching them how to take people 

2688
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:30,790
down.
Look him throwing up arm bars.

2689
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:32,870
They're tapping each other.
It's amazing,

2690
02:04:32,871 --> 02:04:34,910
man.
Look at these combinations.

2691
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:37,710
Nice.
Fucking five.

2692
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:40,440
That's so scary.

2693
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:45,200
Bad ass little kids and if it's not them
by the way,

2694
02:04:45,201 --> 02:04:50,201
they're just one example.
I'm sure there's a third of the 

2695
02:04:50,201 --> 02:04:50,201
movement.
They're all over the world now.

2696
02:04:50,201 --> 02:04:53,030
I mean people that are really into 
having their kids get into athletics,

2697
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:53,830
you know,
they,

2698
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:58,250
they going to be a lot of crazy dads out
there that want their kids to operate on

2699
02:04:58,251 --> 02:05:00,050
the highest level.
I'll take those kids.

2700
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:03,000
That's why you think so?
I think they would.

2701
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:07,010
They would just dance around you and 
kick your legs until you gave up.

2702
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:12,040
I'll just hold him down.
He would start coughing up these brown 

2703
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:12,040
smurfs.
They're just fucking.

2704
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:15,140
Hold on.
You'd like fucking try to light up while

2705
02:05:15,141 --> 02:05:16,430
you're.
While you're.

2706
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,670
While I'm smoking.
Yeah,

2707
02:05:18,671 --> 02:05:19,910
so I will take.
What do you think?

2708
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:25,360
What do you think the number of kids is 
that you couldn't take those kids and 

2709
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:25,360
those kids?

2710
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:27,740
How many would it be before you just got
work?

2711
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:31,330
Seven seminar seven.
Drove around on that.

2712
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:34,880
We went over this before I could take a 
thousand crows with a tennis racket.

2713
02:05:36,450 --> 02:05:41,450
Yeah.
I will fuck up a thousand crows with a 

2714
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:41,450
tennis racket.
I am a hundred percent convinced.

2715
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:46,540
Pretty big man.
There's these crows at my house right 

2716
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:46,540
now.
That's fucked.

2717
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:49,070
I'm bringing the thunder son.
I'm going to take that tennis racket.

2718
02:05:49,071 --> 02:05:51,290
I'm going to put one of those things on 
so I can't lose it.

2719
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:56,320
It's kind of like tied around my.
And I'm going to duct tape that bitch 

2720
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:00,100
threw my hands and around my wrist and 
I'm just gonna fucking spin like a 

2721
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:04,811
tornado and just I'll fuck up a 1000 
crows.

2722
02:06:05,270 --> 02:06:08,300
Set it up.
There's like the size of cats.

2723
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:11,320
Yeah,
and I'll fuck up a thousand cats to give

2724
02:06:11,321 --> 02:06:14,540
me a thousand cats and a tennis racket.
Thousand cats attack there.

2725
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:15,890
You'd be dead.
Uh,

2726
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:18,440
no.
First of all,

2727
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:21,680
they don't have any organizing skill,
so they're going to go one at a time,

2728
02:06:21,681 --> 02:06:25,010
like one of those Steven Seagal movies 
where they've got a circle and then dive

2729
02:06:25,011 --> 02:06:26,480
in.
Then I kinda liked cats.

2730
02:06:26,481 --> 02:06:29,670
Don't act impacts counselor loaners and 
cats.

2731
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:32,810
One cat went in the other cats bug.
Let's see what happens.

2732
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:37,220
There would be a little bit more clever.
They wouldn't attack you and mass.

2733
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:40,190
This is all the cat would have to do.
We've seen this video before.

2734
02:06:43,670 --> 02:06:45,810
All right,
watch this

2735
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:47,490
cat fucks this

2736
02:06:47,630 --> 02:06:48,140
scout.

2737
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:57,410
Oh man,
he's got a fucking choking it man.

2738
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:01,430
Oh man,
I hope that flex that guy.

2739
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,670
Oh he does?
Oh my God.

2740
02:07:04,671 --> 02:07:06,560
Well this poor cat thinks is dying,
man.

2741
02:07:06,561 --> 02:07:07,940
You choking him around his neck

2742
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:13,010
away.
Good.

2743
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:15,280
Does it get worse?
It gets.

2744
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Cat's still not winning with the cats 
flopping around while he's getting 

2745
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,620
strangled man.
Now he's around.

2746
02:07:27,610 --> 02:07:29,520
Get them,
get them cat.

2747
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:33,180
And now the cat's just locked on,
his leg is biting the fuck out of him.

2748
02:07:33,181 --> 02:07:34,800
Get Him.
He's basically biting them.

2749
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:36,190
Whereas Dick is really close

2750
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,780
to his digging into cactus.
Ran Away.

2751
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:40,370
He had to.
He gave up.

2752
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:41,320
Can't get away.

2753
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:42,680
Thundercats Ho.
Yeah.

2754
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:45,150
If you want to get away in your cab by 
the do the Dick.

2755
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:50,010
That's what I learned from that video 
where I caught a thousand cap battle.

2756
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:51,690
Jesus Christ.
Man.

2757
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:52,890
What?
Why would they do that?

2758
02:07:52,891 --> 02:07:55,890
And have it around its neck like that.
You don't expect it to do.

2759
02:07:55,940 --> 02:08:00,940
Yeah.
It was for one of those news stations 

2760
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:00,940
where you're trying to adopt a cat.
You know,

2761
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:02,480
where they like,
they'll have like the reporter,

2762
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:04,580
you know,
like this and kept it going.

2763
02:08:04,581 --> 02:08:05,910
Live exist.
Chicken Jack.

2764
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:06,530
Oh yeah.

2765
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:11,890
Out of their car and killing them.
That was part of this guys having fun.

2766
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:14,100
But that sound goes.
You drop.

2767
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,490
Wow.
That girl,

2768
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:28,390
she,
she,

2769
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,190
she fell out of her character right 
away.

2770
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:33,550
Is there any more annoying character 
then the news character person?

2771
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:36,040
The person who just.
Everything seems fine here.

2772
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:39,460
We're just gonna adopt this cat.
Just no real personality.

2773
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:40,100
It's like,
look,

2774
02:08:40,710 --> 02:08:44,100
I can't cookie cutter sort of way of,
uh,

2775
02:08:44,101 --> 02:08:49,101
of,
of talking and behaving the local news 

2776
02:08:49,101 --> 02:08:49,101
anchor person like they,
they want you,

2777
02:08:49,101 --> 02:08:52,060
just all your personality just squeezed 
out.

2778
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:56,530
The most personality you have is like 
after some completely wacky story,

2779
02:08:56,650 --> 02:08:57,910
you're allowed to go,
well,

2780
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:01,420
isn't that something?
All right,

2781
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:02,730
well,
well here's,

2782
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:07,740
yeah,
here's Bob with sports and you're 

2783
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:07,740
allowed to do that.
But you know,

2784
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:11,910
other than that,
you have to act like your a completely 

2785
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:13,660
robotic cookie cutter type of human 
being.

2786
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:18,680
Yeah.
Here's why so many people get to that 

2787
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:18,680
black guy who got the bug in his mouth 
and went ghetto.

2788
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:23,390
Do you remember that one?
That's a good one because when black 

2789
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:25,711
guys do that,
it's perfect because when black eyes 

2790
02:09:25,711 --> 02:09:27,580
take on the black guy version of the 
white answer,

2791
02:09:27,581 --> 02:09:32,581
Guy Announcer,
guy from the news and then he got a bug 

2792
02:09:32,581 --> 02:09:35,340
in his mouth or some shit and he went 
fucking crazy motherfucker.

2793
02:09:35,730 --> 02:09:37,240
He's just screaming engine.

2794
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:42,350
You find that here's $100.
It's only 100 and you think you get a 

2795
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:44,480
thousand watts when this lady comes on 
when I'm dressing all those cats.

2796
02:09:44,481 --> 02:09:47,570
Just fucking crazy cat lady.
What is this?

2797
02:09:47,571 --> 02:09:52,571
Yeah.
She kept all these strays and she just 

2798
02:09:52,571 --> 02:09:53,210
has all these cats in her house,
but where do they shit?

2799
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:55,700
Can you imagine what that smells like?
Yeah,

2800
02:09:55,701 --> 02:09:56,570
that's her house.
Oh my God.

2801
02:09:56,571 --> 02:09:59,210
They're gonna.
Kill them is what she's called.

2802
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,190
Look at her.
She looks like cat enthusiasm.

2803
02:10:02,310 --> 02:10:04,680
She looks like some of the girls that I 
dated when I was in my twenties,

2804
02:10:04,681 --> 02:10:09,640
but now they're 60 Boston girls.
Monster.

2805
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:14,950
Look,
she's all dolled up for this to really 

2806
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:15,990
get this crazy bitch ideas.
You think your house smells like Piss.

2807
02:10:16,050 --> 02:10:18,930
Hardly write.
How much litter does she use in a day?

2808
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:24,440
100 cats.
Meanwhile they feel like they're in 

2809
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:24,440
prison.
It's like,

2810
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:24,440
why are we all inside?
Do you have a door?

2811
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,580
Can we get outside?
Can we get out of this APP?

2812
02:10:25,890 --> 02:10:27,540
Why do you want to keep us in this house
from birds?

2813
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:29,850
Which are you crazy?
Have you heard about that?

2814
02:10:29,851 --> 02:10:32,040
New Species of spider that makes its own
decoys.

2815
02:10:32,490 --> 02:10:33,470
No.
Yeah,

2816
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:34,490
that's fucking

2817
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:36,810
species of spider.
Um,

2818
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:41,860
it's a,
it's found in the pam bore pata t a,

2819
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:47,621
m b o Pata,
pa Ta Tambo Tambo Potter Research Center

2820
02:10:48,921 --> 02:10:50,900
in the Amazon.
And these,

2821
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:55,960
they make a decoy out of leaves,
dead dead bug parts and other scraps.

2822
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:00,470
And they piece together an artificial 
spider.

2823
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:02,750
And what comes after it though?
Who has a jacket?

2824
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:05,180
Spider.
That's a really good fucking question.

2825
02:11:05,230 --> 02:11:08,120
Something has to be trying to jacket or 
if they're setting themselves up as bait

2826
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:11,630
to reinforce is so fucked though.
I assume that nothing's safe.

2827
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:14,360
I think everything gets jacked in the 
rain forest.

2828
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:16,640
Probably.
What?

2829
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,620
What is,
what's safe

2830
02:11:19,010 --> 02:11:24,010
really happened on that Thursday here to
Augusta high school that led to Chris 

2831
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:27,880
Woods.
Deck contrast propped up town country as

2832
02:11:36,711 --> 02:11:41,711
fucked up town because a bug flew in and
please get the fuck out this country.

2833
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:43,910
My little fuck.
Okay.

2834
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:57,940
Got Real real quick.
The fake news.

2835
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:00,380
Caster voice.
What is it?

2836
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:04,100
Those people I think are the biggest 
perverts because I think it's a lot like

2837
02:12:04,101 --> 02:12:09,101
a.
and this is not based on any research 

2838
02:12:09,101 --> 02:12:09,101
whatsoever,
I'm just talking out my ass.

2839
02:12:09,101 --> 02:12:13,660
But I think if I had to guess,
I would say that that allow those dudes 

2840
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:15,260
are perverted because of the same reason
why Catholic priests become perverted.

2841
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:17,580
You tell them they can't fuck ever,
you know?

2842
02:12:17,581 --> 02:12:22,581
Then they get suppressed and like you 
tell these people they can't behave 

2843
02:12:22,581 --> 02:12:22,581
nutty ever.
And they go,

2844
02:12:22,581 --> 02:12:27,310
they go off the deep end.
This is a restricting other emotions 

2845
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:27,310
though.
So maybe they're just really.

2846
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:29,820
They just lose their fucking temper.
They lose their cool.

2847
02:12:29,821 --> 02:12:30,710
Like,
like that.

2848
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:32,050
Oh yeah.
Because they're there.

2849
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:37,060
So like cause emotional repression,
personality repression on a lot of 

2850
02:12:37,060 --> 02:12:37,820
ambien.
Did you all.

2851
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,720
Lot of Ambien.

2852
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:40,700
There's a lot of ambien.
The sports world.

2853
02:12:40,730 --> 02:12:43,160
A lot of the guys I work with take 
Ambien,

2854
02:12:43,161 --> 02:12:47,030
let guys in the production on the UFC,
they're always fucking pop and Ambien.

2855
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:52,060
They pop them on a plane,
pop them in a hotel room like you guys 

2856
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:52,310
are fucking crazy man.
Ipod,

2857
02:12:52,370 --> 02:12:54,590
new mood,
mood,

2858
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:59,390
Melatonin.
Just kind of fuck.

2859
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:01,760
I forget what I was going to download.
God dammit.

2860
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:03,930
I was trying to bring these giants.
No,

2861
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:04,270
no,
no,

2862
02:13:04,271 --> 02:13:04,510
no,
no,

2863
02:13:04,511 --> 02:13:04,760
no,
no,

2864
02:13:04,761 --> 02:13:05,030
no,
no,

2865
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:05,540
no,
no.

2866
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:09,170
Fuck God dammit.
Oh Shit.

2867
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:14,710
I totally lost my thought.
It was about a spider.

2868
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:17,290
Fuck.
God dammit.

2869
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:22,300
I hate when that happens.
Now Brian fucked me up by throwing up 

2870
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,090
this video of this guy.
We were talking about the spider.

2871
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:28,040
No Amazon fucking things up.
Things dying.

2872
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:29,480
Now.
God Damn it.

2873
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:32,220
Train

2874
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:37,220
of thought on podcasts is never a free 
flowing pie chart where you can.

2875
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:43,820
It's not a linear progression tree where
branches are floating in the air and 

2876
02:13:44,161 --> 02:13:47,460
you've got to grab them while you can or
a where you are.

2877
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:50,430
You're losing them.
I lost that one fucking shit.

2878
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:53,120
Why you laughing?
Fucker.

2879
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:57,950
Just all funny picture of what?
This is a catch.

2880
02:13:58,020 --> 02:13:58,890
Getting a snowball.

2881
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:05,720
Oh,
the cat taking stovall right in the 

2882
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:05,720
face.
He's gonna be trying to catch the ball.

2883
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:08,830
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2884
02:14:10,090 --> 02:14:11,800
That's the things you do when you live 
in Ohio.

2885
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:13,710
Throw snowballs at.
You can.

2886
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:14,100
Okay.

2887
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:20,850
Damn.
I wish I could remember what the fuck I 

2888
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:20,850
wanted to bring up.

2889
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:22,870
Fuck.
'Em.

2890
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:29,250
It had something to do with the Amazon.
Had something to do with spiders and 

2891
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:29,470
crazy shit that they're,
uh,

2892
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:34,650
they're finding now in the Amazon.
They never run out of things that will 

2893
02:14:34,811 --> 02:14:36,210
kill you down there.
They're always fun.

2894
02:14:36,230 --> 02:14:38,060
Some new shit they found in,
um,

2895
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:43,620
in the Congo,
they found a group of spiders that acts 

2896
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:43,990
as a pack first time they've ever 
observed this,

2897
02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:48,040
that there's hundreds of spiders and 
they make big gigantic web.

2898
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:51,370
And then when big shit goes in there 
like rats or something big enough,

2899
02:14:51,371 --> 02:14:54,100
they just swarm it and fuck it up.
That's a nightmare for me.

2900
02:14:54,110 --> 02:14:59,110
Yeah.
Know they figured out how to act as 

2901
02:14:59,110 --> 02:14:59,110
packs.
It's really spooky.

2902
02:14:59,110 --> 02:15:00,130
I think there's a youtube video of that 
too.

2903
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:02,250
Hold on.
Spiders act as packs.

2904
02:15:03,370 --> 02:15:08,370
My girlfriend is covering her eyes.
She has a massive spider phobia is 

2905
02:15:08,370 --> 02:15:09,190
really incredible.
It's like legit,

2906
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:14,250
like legit,
like as strong as any spider phobia in 

2907
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:14,250
any other human ever.

2908
02:15:14,950 --> 02:15:15,810
Does she know that?
That,

2909
02:15:15,811 --> 02:15:18,220
that couch had uh,
an ESA spider eggs in it?

2910
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:19,970
Did it really?
Yeah.

2911
02:15:20,290 --> 02:15:21,590
Why was that?
Why did you have any?

2912
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:24,340
I think I killed it off.
I just sprayed windex on it today.

2913
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:29,550
I don't think that's bad right now.
Her back is tensing up really hard and 

2914
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:33,020
she's losing some muscular control.
There is a few times to yourself,

2915
02:15:33,070 --> 02:15:34,540
but it gets close.
I just kidding.

2916
02:15:34,541 --> 02:15:36,680
There's a spider.
They're just next to a bunch of com.

2917
02:15:38,110 --> 02:15:38,960
Brian pulled this up.

2918
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:42,260
Fighters living in groups in Congo on 
Youtube.

2919
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:47,500
Spiders living in groups in Congo.
There's a the first video that comes up 

2920
02:15:48,051 --> 02:15:53,051
on a google search.
It's a BBC documentary that shows these 

2921
02:15:53,051 --> 02:15:57,341
fucking spiders acting as a pack.
Spiders.

2922
02:15:59,050 --> 02:16:01,060
They found a frog that flies recently,

2923
02:16:02,190 --> 02:16:07,190
like a flying squirrel.
They're going to find so much shit 

2924
02:16:07,190 --> 02:16:10,400
underwater to the Congo.
Africa mighty as far as to bitch is not 

2925
02:16:12,551 --> 02:16:15,010
even there.
She's in a backyard right now pretending

2926
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:16,650
she's too pretty to be in the condo.

2927
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:23,320
Walking all these spiders fight as 
creepy enough.

2928
02:16:23,710 --> 02:16:28,710
Put these communal spiders leaving 
groups of up to 1500 single giant web.

2929
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:36,360
Look at that.
That's so fucked her.

2930
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:42,160
She's got her head down and see it.
Whenever you want to come over here and 

2931
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:45,711
take to the nightmare.
Look at what happens when they get 

2932
02:16:45,711 --> 02:16:48,900
something.
They just all swarm and oh,

2933
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:52,470
they're super little rush to see what 
sticks.

2934
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:57,720
Maybe that math might be the size of a 
fucking going for a neutral spine is 

2935
02:16:58,930 --> 02:17:03,640
working together like this.
It makes sense here in the underworld as

2936
02:17:03,641 --> 02:17:07,150
whips are often destroyed by rain 
falling debris,

2937
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:12,710
animals charging through spiders do 
loose if their web repairs at night and 

2938
02:17:13,990 --> 02:17:17,080
I can't see me getting much rest either.
Masturbating.

2939
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:18,860
Dude,
that's.

2940
02:17:18,970 --> 02:17:20,340
That's scary.
Yeah,

2941
02:17:20,341 --> 02:17:21,330
that sucks.
The fat one.

2942
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:26,360
There's A.
There's a video on ridiculousness of 

2943
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:28,551
this guy trying to capture a giant 
spider in Australia on the wall and he 

2944
02:17:28,551 --> 02:17:33,081
has like this tupperware and a helmet 
and he goes to put it on the thing and 

2945
02:17:33,081 --> 02:17:34,590
the thing just jumps right at his face.
Bam.

2946
02:17:34,591 --> 02:17:37,380
Hits him right in the helmet.
That was some spooky shit too.

2947
02:17:37,580 --> 02:17:40,540
Or how about a spider and some cocaine?
Use this video.

2948
02:17:40,541 --> 02:17:43,530
Joe Spider on cocaine.
Spider with a whole bunch of cocaine.

2949
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:49,240
Is it real?
That's not real and I guess he just 

2950
02:17:50,291 --> 02:17:51,130
starts freaking out.

2951
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:55,220
I think I would kill him.

2952
02:17:56,330 --> 02:17:58,850
Probably Sugar.
You ever seen a spider on acid?

2953
02:17:58,910 --> 02:18:03,910
Wait a minute.
Spider is this real brand slicks enemy 

2954
02:18:04,490 --> 02:18:06,220
to me.
I don't think it's animated,

2955
02:18:06,230 --> 02:18:08,260
but I dunno if it's cocaine,
cocaine,

2956
02:18:08,330 --> 02:18:09,770
what is he doing?
Oh my God.

2957
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:13,700
He's covering himself with sand cocaine.
He's just like,

2958
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:14,170
ah.

2959
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:16,680
It is that they are they actually saying
that it's cocaine.

2960
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:22,030
If you had that much coke,
the last thing you'd want to do is 

2961
02:18:22,030 --> 02:18:22,220
experiment with spiders,
spider,

2962
02:18:22,221 --> 02:18:23,840
and it was in a hooker's asshole.
You'd go,

2963
02:18:23,841 --> 02:18:25,730
yeah,
maybe that's guys got real coke,

2964
02:18:27,090 --> 02:18:29,690
which is just a spider like that.
Yeah.

2965
02:18:29,691 --> 02:18:31,720
There's A.
There's a youtube video called spiders

2966
02:18:31,890 --> 02:18:36,890
drugs,
which I believe they back in the day 

2967
02:18:36,890 --> 02:18:38,640
that gave acid inspires the Steve,
what?

2968
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:42,900
The spider is the most accomplished of 
all web building species.

2969
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:49,580
Recently,
scientists gave these tiny creatures a 

2970
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:51,840
variety of psychoactive drugs to observe
their effects on web building.

2971
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:58,340
When given a minute dose of Lsd,
the spider's Web took on an unfamiliar 

2972
02:18:59,010 --> 02:19:03,480
minimalist structure that didn't get 
much work done when given caffeine,

2973
02:19:03,780 --> 02:19:08,780
the web structure was not affected,
but the spiders behavior was whoa.

2974
02:19:10,650 --> 02:19:14,340
Given thc the active ingredient in 
marijuana,

2975
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:19,880
the spider didn't build a web.
It built a hammock where it lay all day 

2976
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:22,860
and watch the caffeine spider go,

2977
02:19:25,210 --> 02:19:27,950
that Shit's not true.

2978
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:34,060
That's not true.
You just fuck people over with this 

2979
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:34,060
information.
That's so wrong,

2980
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:35,840
man.
It's not true.

2981
02:19:35,841 --> 02:19:36,200
Right.

2982
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:41,900
I think there really was.
There really was a test called cane 

2983
02:19:42,211 --> 02:19:44,960
spider.
Figured building webs was for soccer,

2984
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:48,360
waited until the caffeine spider was 
exhausted.

2985
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:53,750
Then came up behind it and pop the cap 
and it's asked Mr Krzak spider spider 

2986
02:19:59,791 --> 02:20:04,791
had no place to live.
It ended up in the crack web as the 

2987
02:20:04,791 --> 02:20:08,130
crack spiders bitch for more information
on the crack spiders.

2988
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:10,080
That's so funny.

2989
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:15,230
That's ridiculous.
Did you hear about this study that 

2990
02:20:15,230 --> 02:20:18,231
they're.
They're trying to do at Harvard medical 

2991
02:20:18,231 --> 02:20:20,871
school is looking for an adventurous 
woman who's willing to give birth to a 

2992
02:20:21,001 --> 02:20:23,610
neanderthal.
Awesome.

2993
02:20:23,730 --> 02:20:27,630
This is there really going to make a 
neanderthal from.

2994
02:20:27,631 --> 02:20:30,270
We're going to make out of fucking human
being.

2995
02:20:30,271 --> 02:20:32,850
I don't know how the fuck they're going 
to do like Jurassic Park style.

2996
02:20:32,851 --> 02:20:36,200
They find an old bone and they're going 
to get some DNA out of there and well,

2997
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:41,210
what's really bananas is that they're 
actually creating a life that is 

2998
02:20:42,031 --> 02:20:45,120
essentially a type of human being.
I mean,

2999
02:20:45,121 --> 02:20:47,550
neanderthals are essentially a type of 
human being,

3000
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:49,990
right?
I mean that's the.

3001
02:20:50,260 --> 02:20:53,010
That's,
that's the definition.

3002
02:20:53,011 --> 02:20:54,360
Okay.
They're not homosapien,

3003
02:20:54,390 --> 02:20:55,830
but they are a type of human being.
Right?

3004
02:20:56,130 --> 02:20:57,990
Like,
isn't that like Homo Floresiensis?

3005
02:20:57,991 --> 02:20:59,490
Are they a type of human?
I don't know.

3006
02:20:59,550 --> 02:21:00,690
Are they a type of primate?

3007
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:03,030
We haven't had to cross that bridge.
It hasn't come up yet.

3008
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:08,460
That's a slippery slope.
How far back do we still have to give 

3009
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:09,120
them the rights of people or should we 
give them the rights of people?

3010
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:10,920
We should treat all animals with 
respect,

3011
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:16,100
but you know how far back in the species
chain do we declare somebody assenting 

3012
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:17,970
it being well,
yeah.

3013
02:21:17,971 --> 02:21:22,971
Not only that,
what do you do with this thing and you 

3014
02:21:22,971 --> 02:21:23,520
allow it to go into society and mate,
do you allow it to have a life?

3015
02:21:23,521 --> 02:21:25,620
What if you make a male and it starts 
raping?

3016
02:21:25,710 --> 02:21:30,710
What if it goes in the UFC?
What if it goes into the UFC or GEICO 

3017
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:33,450
Christ?
What if it's five feet tall?

3018
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:35,640
Two hundred pounds.
That's what neanderthals.

3019
02:21:35,641 --> 02:21:39,270
Wade and just chimp strong because 
neanderthals by the way,

3020
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:42,240
had bone structure that was completely 
different than ours.

3021
02:21:42,270 --> 02:21:44,760
I mean you,
their bones were much thicker,

3022
02:21:44,761 --> 02:21:46,560
much heavier,
you know,

3023
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:48,990
they,
they were literally five feet tall,

3024
02:21:48,991 --> 02:21:52,020
200 pounds and that's just different.

3025
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:54,060
They're built different than human 
beings.

3026
02:21:54,990 --> 02:21:59,990
What would that would they allow that 
have to be a whole new set of Nevada 

3027
02:21:59,990 --> 02:22:01,830
State Athletic Commission?
A lot of things in our society would get

3028
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:05,790
really kind of weird if there was 
another set of and b.

3029
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:09,090
Did you see district nine or did you 
like it?

3030
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:10,950
That was all right.
I liked it.

3031
02:22:11,610 --> 02:22:13,590
I thought it was pretty interesting what
they were trying to do.

3032
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:18,620
If you haven't seen as a science fiction
movie about this alien spacecrafts 

3033
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:18,620
wasn't there supposed to be more of 
them?

3034
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:19,710
Yeah,
I think they're going to do another one.

3035
02:22:19,711 --> 02:22:24,711
They were going to do it.
They left room at the end of it for a 

3036
02:22:24,711 --> 02:22:25,140
sequel,
but it was the science.

3037
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,010
Cgi

3038
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:31,010
animation gotten good enough where they 
could make a realistic movie about 

3039
02:22:31,441 --> 02:22:36,441
these,
these aliens living amongst people and 

3040
02:22:36,441 --> 02:22:38,601
the way they did it was pretty.
It was pretty cool about how they just 

3041
02:22:38,601 --> 02:22:41,631
sort of assimilated in sort of became a 
part of life here on earth that people 

3042
02:22:41,631 --> 02:22:42,240
just dealt with.
The fact that these,

3043
02:22:42,241 --> 02:22:43,710
uh,
what did they call them?

3044
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:48,830
They called them.
They had some fucking creepy name for 

3045
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:48,830
them that pissed them off.
Oh yeah.

3046
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:53,501
Yeah.
But I mean if they went a hold and went 

3047
02:22:53,501 --> 02:22:56,160
and went ahead rather and did this and 
created neanderthals,

3048
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,680
we might find out why neanderthals are 
extinct,

3049
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,720
you know,
we might've killed them off.

3050
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:06,110
I mean,
it's very possible that human beings 

3051
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:07,140
killed them off because we don't know 
what their behavior was like.

3052
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:10,680
But we do know what the behavior of a 
lot of other primates is.

3053
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:14,760
Like we know how fucking ruthless 
chimpanzees ruthless baboons are.

3054
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:20,120
What if we know how ruthless people are,
we know how ruthless Homo Sapiens 

3055
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:22,080
neanderthals and take it to the next 
level.

3056
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:27,320
What are the fucking baby and psychos 
because we found evidence of of 

3057
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:33,500
cannibalism on a lot of human corpses 
that they think might have been either a

3058
02:23:35,431 --> 02:23:39,270
result of homosapiens or neanderthals 
prey Predator,

3059
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:43,260
neanderthals going after people,
and then there might've been like humans

3060
02:23:43,261 --> 02:23:46,530
hunting humans in the nfl,
hunting people or people hunting them.

3061
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:52,250
They also know that it was one of the 
things that talked about with the Steve 

3062
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:53,910
Rinella.
The native Americans were rampant,

3063
02:23:53,911 --> 02:23:57,360
cannibals and a lot of parts of this 
country for show or for me,

3064
02:23:57,390 --> 02:23:58,590
for me.
Really?

3065
02:23:58,730 --> 02:24:00,480
Yeah.
Especially the Great Lakes area.

3066
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:05,660
Apparently Great Lakes area.
They were known for catching people and 

3067
02:24:05,660 --> 02:24:10,010
eating them.
That's one of the things that's always 

3068
02:24:10,010 --> 02:24:12,021
difficult when you look at these 
cultures that you revere because I 

3069
02:24:12,021 --> 02:24:13,350
certainly revere a lot of things about 
native American spirituality and certain

3070
02:24:13,351 --> 02:24:15,720
things about Mezo,
American spirituality as well,

3071
02:24:15,930 --> 02:24:20,930
but then you see these cultures in their
peak doing things like human sacrifice 

3072
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:21,920
cannibalism or weird things and they're 
like,

3073
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:27,730
well,
we weren't quite there yet at some good 

3074
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:27,730
principles.

3075
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:32,170
Yeah.
They were still ripping people's hearts 

3076
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:32,170
out to please the sun.
God.

3077
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:33,350
Well,
the,

3078
02:24:33,380 --> 02:24:38,380
the creation of the temple of Tlt will 
con is that said the Aztec temple where 

3079
02:24:39,091 --> 02:24:42,000
they killed 80,000
people in four days.

3080
02:24:42,270 --> 02:24:44,760
They sacrificed something like 80,000
people.

3081
02:24:44,820 --> 02:24:48,390
They were all prisoners essentially that
they use to build the temple.

3082
02:24:48,610 --> 02:24:49,560
Then once they were done,
they're like,

3083
02:24:49,561 --> 02:24:50,280
okay,
cool.

3084
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:53,960
We're gonna fucking kill you all now.
Now that we,

3085
02:24:54,030 --> 02:24:59,030
now that we're done.
So it's like on one hand you have this 

3086
02:24:59,030 --> 02:25:01,911
amazing society that's capable of 
creating such a magnificent structure 

3087
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:05,580
like this huge,
gigantic Aztec temple.

3088
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:10,870
But the other hand,
they're also capable of killing 

3089
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:10,870
everybody that helped build it,
cut their fucking hearts out,

3090
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:12,930
chuck and them down a flight of stone 
stairs,

3091
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:13,830
thump,
thump,

3092
02:25:13,890 --> 02:25:14,550
thump,
thump,

3093
02:25:14,670 --> 02:25:15,690
thump.
Next,

3094
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:18,370
somebody.
I'm Dan Dodi,

3095
02:25:18,570 --> 02:25:20,130
uh,
one of the guys that was working on that

3096
02:25:20,131 --> 02:25:22,620
media to show with me when we were going
over this.

3097
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:24,190
We were talking about how crazy those 
numbers are.

3098
02:25:24,191 --> 02:25:29,191
He did a calculation of it.
It means you have to kill someone every 

3099
02:25:29,191 --> 02:25:29,460
13 seconds.
Massive,

3100
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:35,240
massive obsidian,
the city and knives and stab their 

3101
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:41,460
fucking hack in your head off with a 
stone ax and they're killing someone 

3102
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:42,880
every 13 seconds.
It's intense.

3103
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:48,610
This doctor has a really crazy ideal and
outlook on this to sort of justify.

3104
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:50,950
You can tell that this guy wants to do 
this.

3105
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:53,620
This is one of his goal,
wasn't of his quotes.

3106
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:57,760
If you become a monoculture,
you are at great risk of perishing.

3107
02:25:57,940 --> 02:26:02,940
Therefore,
the recreation of neanderthals would be 

3108
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:03,460
mainly a question of societal risk 
avoidance.

3109
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:08,820
So he's saying that it would benefit the
human race to reincorporate neanderthals

3110
02:26:10,151 --> 02:26:11,170
into our population.

3111
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:14,210
You know,
man,

3112
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:16,930
fuck.
Do you know what they're like?

3113
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:22,340
They are way more primitive than us.
Where words this accepting that 

3114
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:24,430
physically they're way more dominant 
than us.

3115
02:26:24,490 --> 02:26:28,120
They probably would beat us in sports.
Their bones are thicker,

3116
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:31,720
much stronger.
Yet if we could outsmart them,

3117
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:33,790
but here's the thing.
They had bigger brains than us.

3118
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:34,990
Yeah,
but we won.

3119
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:36,790
Yeah,
but why did we win?

3120
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:40,050
Did we win because we're the more evil.
No,

3121
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:41,740
I wonder.
I wonder what the hell was.

3122
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:44,160
I think that's why we got to do it.
Just figure it out.

3123
02:26:44,161 --> 02:26:49,161
I think we're more clever than them 
because there's also evidence that 

3124
02:26:49,161 --> 02:26:49,690
neanderthals had figured out a lot of 
shit that we figured out,

3125
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:54,930
like tool making and fire.
They didn't figure out the Internet 

3126
02:26:54,930 --> 02:26:54,930
though.
They didn't have guns.

3127
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:57,340
Dummies.
Yeah.

3128
02:26:57,341 --> 02:27:02,341
I think.
I think we're on a path towards more 

3129
02:27:02,341 --> 02:27:04,831
clever and more spiritually enlightened,
but it's a very divergent path that has 

3130
02:27:04,831 --> 02:27:09,361
big errors and big fuck ups and big 
terminal nodes that really aren't going 

3131
02:27:09,361 --> 02:27:09,550
anywhere.

3132
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:11,030
Maybe you're just going to have people 
die.

3133
02:27:11,090 --> 02:27:16,090
Were the cuts.
Maybe we won and where the cuts and the 

3134
02:27:16,090 --> 02:27:19,820
neanderthals have won.
Maybe they were like way cooler than us 

3135
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:21,970
and they were just overwhelmed them with
continuous and maybe you're all the shit

3136
02:27:21,971 --> 02:27:26,971
that we point to as like problems in our
society could all be avoided if we went 

3137
02:27:26,971 --> 02:27:29,920
back to being the anatomic one.
That was the triumph of evil ever.

3138
02:27:29,921 --> 02:27:30,370
Get on it.
Well,

3139
02:27:30,371 --> 02:27:35,371
this is one of the things that the guy's
saying that neanderthals might think 

3140
02:27:35,371 --> 02:27:39,121
differently than we do.
We know they have a larger cranial size 

3141
02:27:39,121 --> 02:27:39,430
and they could even be more intelligent 
than us.

3142
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:40,630
Wow.
That is crazy.

3143
02:27:40,631 --> 02:27:45,631
I never heard anybody say that when the 
time comes to deal with an epidemic of 

3144
02:27:45,631 --> 02:27:49,111
getting off the planet or whatever,
it's conceivable that their way of 

3145
02:27:49,111 --> 02:27:49,111
thinking could be beneficial.

3146
02:27:49,111 --> 02:27:53,080
This guy's fucking crazy.
Their way of thinking.

3147
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:56,430
He wants to raise a fucking civilization
of neanderthals.

3148
02:27:56,470 --> 02:28:00,250
He wants to bring this guy probably 
masturbates to pictures of balls.

3149
02:28:00,970 --> 02:28:05,970
He's probably a freaks.
This guy's asking a woman to give birth 

3150
02:28:05,970 --> 02:28:08,470
to a fucking new kind of monkey or a new
kind of whatever the fuck it is.

3151
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:11,760
If it's not a human.
I mean we're humans Homosapien,

3152
02:28:11,770 --> 02:28:13,060
right.
Is that the case?

3153
02:28:13,380 --> 02:28:18,380
So what is that?
So neonatologists another type of 

3154
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:18,380
primate or is another type of is 
another?

3155
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:20,170
No,
I think it was a different chain.

3156
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:22,310
I think as far as I recall,

3157
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:27,310
and this is a little vague,
but I think it was a different chain of 

3158
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:28,820
evolution where that when terminated in 
neanderthal and another one,

3159
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:31,280
all the homo erectus,
Homo Sapiens,

3160
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:34,250
they all went on another evolutionary 
chain.

3161
02:28:34,910 --> 02:28:39,110
I think that's how it went.
I don't think there's a direct link,

3162
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:40,460
but I dunno.

3163
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:42,330
Yeah,
I dunno either.

3164
02:28:43,630 --> 02:28:45,340
Yeah,
interesting to think about though.

3165
02:28:45,341 --> 02:28:47,240
And it also gets,
you know,

3166
02:28:47,470 --> 02:28:50,340
the minute you introduce,
especially in more advanced cultures,

3167
02:28:50,350 --> 02:28:55,350
like if,
if there were an alien culture that 

3168
02:28:55,350 --> 02:28:56,230
would come,
the amount of chaos that would cause,

3169
02:28:56,231 --> 02:29:01,231
particularly in the religious structure 
of things would be earth shaking.

3170
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:06,810
I mean the whole tenants of all of this 
that we are created in God's image 

3171
02:29:06,810 --> 02:29:07,470
perfectly blah blah,
blah.

3172
02:29:07,480 --> 02:29:10,090
That and then you have someone who's 
smarter,

3173
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:11,920
Cooler,
badder than us,

3174
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:13,130
you know,
and then how does,

3175
02:29:13,150 --> 02:29:16,330
how do you rectify that with all these 
major religions?

3176
02:29:16,331 --> 02:29:19,090
I think that's,
that would be the biggest.

3177
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:21,460
There would be a huge upheaval if that 
happened.

3178
02:29:21,550 --> 02:29:23,530
Massive chaos.
Yeah.

3179
02:29:23,531 --> 02:29:24,940
What the fuck man.

3180
02:29:26,050 --> 02:29:30,670
Have you google neanderthal profile of a
super predator.

3181
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:36,030
This is one a widely discounted and I 
should say this widely discounted 

3182
02:29:36,521 --> 02:29:37,990
theory,
however,

3183
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:42,480
it's kind of fun.
Kind of fun to talk about it.

3184
02:29:42,610 --> 02:29:47,610
Neanderthal poor profile.
Um,

3185
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:54,740
what did I google profile of a monster?
The profile of the Super Predator.

3186
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:00,670
This,
uh,

3187
02:30:00,750 --> 02:30:05,750
this guy had this idea that the,
the vision that we had of neanderthals 

3188
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:08,130
looking just like us was really based on
nothing.

3189
02:30:08,131 --> 02:30:13,131
We don't have any actual neanderthal 
bodies were putting skin on them and 

3190
02:30:13,131 --> 02:30:18,050
recreating them with clay.
And why would we do this and make it 

3191
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:22,341
look like that when we might want to 
make it look like a gorilla or a champ 

3192
02:30:22,341 --> 02:30:24,860
or a profile.
Super Predator.

3193
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,950
Look up videos,
buddy video.

3194
02:30:27,010 --> 02:30:28,270
Go to video.
Youtube.

3195
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:34,620
What does that.
Would you put butthole or Mexican in 

3196
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:34,620
there?
How are you getting all these,

3197
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:36,220
this mustache yet?
What are you doing?

3198
02:30:36,750 --> 02:30:38,410
How are you getting this?
Oh,

3199
02:30:38,411 --> 02:30:41,060
that's not neanderthals.
Google did it.

3200
02:30:41,710 --> 02:30:42,560
Cool.
Thyra.

3201
02:30:43,210 --> 02:30:45,040
Yeah,
that's what you need.

3202
02:30:45,740 --> 02:30:50,740
It's just any,
a looking mustache and a n,

3203
02:30:51,310 --> 02:30:53,530
d,
e r t h a l.

3204
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:57,210
that's it.
Click on the first one.

3205
02:30:57,450 --> 02:31:00,180
It's kind of cool.
Go full screen on this bitch.

3206
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:06,080
So the car,
the accepted view of what the look like.

3207
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:10,730
A big hairy than us and with a lot of 
those and think thicker brow ridges.

3208
02:31:11,170 --> 02:31:13,490
But apart from that there are 
unquestionably human.

3209
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:19,600
In fact,
it's been said that if you gave the 

3210
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:19,710
Neanderthal to shape the head count and 
dressed him up in a nice suit,

3211
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:23,790
he can easily attend Harvard,
although it named rich parents.

3212
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:26,430
There's a couple of things wrong with 
this picture.

3213
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:29,310
First,
it's not based on any sound,

3214
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:33,420
archaeological evidence.
That's because soft tissue features like

3215
02:31:33,450 --> 02:31:38,450
skin hair,
color and non preserved the undertone.

3216
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:43,860
The other reason is that after studying 
the end of those for 10 years,

3217
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:46,620
I'm convinced they look nothing like 
this at all.

3218
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:50,100
I've only been remaining or throw them 
at us here on the end,

3219
02:31:50,101 --> 02:31:52,110
the thought predation created modern 
humans.

3220
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:57,680
In this video,
I'm going to draw on the latest 

3221
02:31:57,680 --> 02:31:59,540
archeological,
genetic and forensic evidence to 

3222
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:01,020
challenge our assumptions about what 
neanderthals look like.

3223
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:07,700
It looks like something we should make a
kettle bell.

3224
02:32:11,470 --> 02:32:16,470
You can see examples of this enter 
promoting bias in television 

3225
02:32:16,470 --> 02:32:17,830
documentaries and in museum 
reconstructions around the world.

3226
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:21,220
Men are sometimes showers quite 
handsome.

3227
02:32:21,250 --> 02:32:25,390
We just want to get to try it back 
there.

3228
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:30,440
We and some of them,
I believe that neanderthal males so 

3229
02:32:33,611 --> 02:32:38,611
began hunting human females mistakes 
really size.

3230
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:43,940
It really makes me mad of sexual and 
cannibalistic predation went on for an 

3231
02:32:46,361 --> 02:32:48,190
excess of $50,000.

3232
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:53,270
Imagine if.
Imagine if you had one of those coming 

3233
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:53,270
after Mrs Rogan.
Woo Man.

3234
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:57,590
Could you imagine if we were you.
We recreate this thing and it does come 

3235
02:32:57,590 --> 02:33:00,861
out looking like that,
that this woman gives birth is 

3236
02:33:00,861 --> 02:33:00,861
neanderthal and it comes out looking 
like an ape.

3237
02:33:00,970 --> 02:33:05,970
It really tests them are fucked up black
face with big gigantic teeth and knows 

3238
02:33:06,551 --> 02:33:11,551
how to use spears.
I think this guy is like really quacky 

3239
02:33:11,551 --> 02:33:12,270
though,
and he is Australian,

3240
02:33:12,271 --> 02:33:14,320
which makes them extra quacky.
No,

3241
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:19,450
there's not a lot of like super experts 
that people take seriously that top 

3242
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:20,280
light that.
Except for grandma on the bush,

3243
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:23,220
he's English,
but English is completely different.

3244
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:25,920
If you have English,
you can sell things that people wouldn't

3245
02:33:25,921 --> 02:33:30,921
ordinarily buy.
Like cooking where if you have like an 

3246
02:33:30,921 --> 02:33:30,921
English salesperson.
Yeah.

3247
02:33:30,921 --> 02:33:32,310
But uh,
but Australian,

3248
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:37,370
unless you're selling boomerangs or some
sort of a crocodile gun,

3249
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:40,070
you know,
you're not going to listen to Australian

3250
02:33:40,071 --> 02:33:40,280
dude.

3251
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:42,180
He's just there to fun,
loving,

3252
02:33:42,181 --> 02:33:47,181
carefree people.
They're not really the right are 

3253
02:33:47,181 --> 02:33:50,420
archeologists are the right people to 
tell you what a fucking neanderthal 

3254
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:51,120
looks like.
At least the way we want them to be.

3255
02:33:51,450 --> 02:33:52,740
Yeah.
I wonder if this is bullshit.

3256
02:33:54,570 --> 02:33:59,570
Like I said,
this guy's widely widely been 

3257
02:33:59,570 --> 02:34:02,510
discredited the aquatic ape theory,
which had me for about an hour and a 

3258
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:02,510
half.
Yeah,

3259
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:03,300
that's a weird one,
right?

3260
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:08,360
There's a theory.
They're wondering why human beings are 

3261
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:11,241
so fatty when we're babies as opposed to
other primates which come out like 

3262
02:34:11,241 --> 02:34:12,930
champs when they're babies,
they come out and they're looking.

3263
02:34:13,350 --> 02:34:15,330
They look pretty rugged like right out 
of the gate.

3264
02:34:15,331 --> 02:34:16,140
They got sin.
You.

3265
02:34:16,141 --> 02:34:18,160
They don't have a lot of body,
but people were like

3266
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:23,190
balls of fat and the idea was that we 
were born to sort of be able to float 

3267
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:25,660
around and water and then we lived by 
the water.

3268
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:28,360
We were aquatic apes while we did live 
by the water.

3269
02:34:28,361 --> 02:34:33,361
When those volcanoes happen,
I think that was something that the 

3270
02:34:33,361 --> 02:34:34,360
genetic bottleneck theory,
which does have some criticisms too,

3271
02:34:34,361 --> 02:34:39,361
but when these volcanoes happen,
if forced everybody to the only life 

3272
02:34:39,361 --> 02:34:43,321
source that was available at the time 
which was coming out of the ocean is 

3273
02:34:43,321 --> 02:34:43,321
those were the,
those were the,

3274
02:34:43,321 --> 02:34:45,940
you know,
the fish and the seaweed and things that

3275
02:34:45,941 --> 02:34:48,530
were unaffected by the massive climate 
change and the,

3276
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:53,980
the,
the shit that was in the air that was 

3277
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:53,980
causing people massive death.

3278
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:54,510
Well,
they say even to this day,

3279
02:34:54,511 --> 02:34:56,700
80 percent of the world's population 
lives near the water,

3280
02:34:57,450 --> 02:35:00,360
which is kind of fascinating because as 
the water level rises,

3281
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:03,100
if something catastrophic happens,
I mean that,

3282
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:07,380
that really would leave a fucking lot of
confused motherfuckers in the middle.

3283
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:10,080
You know,
if the world.

3284
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:12,720
It's like say if the United States and 
every other part of the world,

3285
02:35:12,990 --> 02:35:17,990
everything a thousand miles in each 
direction was covered with ocean and 

3286
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:19,890
you're just left with the center of the 
United States.

3287
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:22,180
Good luck.
Okay.

3288
02:35:22,510 --> 02:35:24,540
Got dudes who know how to make bows and 
arrows.

3289
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:26,250
You know,
I mean for real.

3290
02:35:26,430 --> 02:35:31,430
If you were left with like South Dakota,
if South Dakota was all the humans that 

3291
02:35:31,430 --> 02:35:34,060
were above water and everything else 
done,

3292
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:36,930
you got plenty of food.
Okay,

3293
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:40,800
but there's no more internet and you've 
got to figure out society from scratch,

3294
02:35:40,980 --> 02:35:43,500
from only the people in South Dakota.

3295
02:35:43,860 --> 02:35:46,020
Just a total random sampling.
That's a tough go.

3296
02:35:46,050 --> 02:35:48,150
Good luck.
Good luck away.

3297
02:35:48,151 --> 02:35:52,050
Most of these catastrophic work tasks,
Duffy's work though is the smartest,

3298
02:35:52,051 --> 02:35:53,160
the brightest,
the cleverest.

3299
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:58,180
They are the ones that ended up 
surviving or you put a gun in their 

3300
02:35:58,180 --> 02:35:59,310
mouth because they don't want to survive
with all these fucking dummies trying to

3301
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:01,050
eat them and they're like,
you know what?

3302
02:36:01,051 --> 02:36:03,330
I think I'm going to just check out and 
see what's next.

3303
02:36:03,450 --> 02:36:08,450
You know,
it was a crazy place to go with Pompei 

3304
02:36:08,450 --> 02:36:10,580
and you go there and you see when the 
people are frozen and ash like huddling 

3305
02:36:10,580 --> 02:36:15,141
with their kids within that just rolled 
through and discipline just blew up and 

3306
02:36:15,141 --> 02:36:17,250
vesuvius rolled in and kicked everything
in.

3307
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:18,810
Ash,
that's a crazy,

3308
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:20,880
crazy moment.
Frozen in time.

3309
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:24,420
It's interesting to see,
and not that long ago either.

3310
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:25,000
No,
no.

3311
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:28,200
Remember Mount St Helen's remember when 
we were younger?

3312
02:36:28,230 --> 02:36:28,920
Yeah,
super young.

3313
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:30,630
That was a.
That was a big one.

3314
02:36:30,631 --> 02:36:31,260
Man.
That was a.

3315
02:36:31,350 --> 02:36:35,100
There was a Washington state and a giant
volcano blew off.

3316
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:38,850
We just don't see enough of those.
They happen so rarely were like,

3317
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:40,200
oh,
okay.

3318
02:36:40,201 --> 02:36:45,201
That's what fucking happens.
There was that one in Iceland that 

3319
02:36:45,201 --> 02:36:45,201
fucked up air travel,
but yeah,

3320
02:36:45,201 --> 02:36:47,360
that was a little bit of a baby one.
Yeah,

3321
02:36:47,540 --> 02:36:49,410
I think.
I Dunno.

3322
02:36:49,470 --> 02:36:52,140
I think it has a big brother though that
when that one goes off,

3323
02:36:52,650 --> 02:36:55,650
then I think the last time that happened
that the water froze,

3324
02:36:55,651 --> 02:36:59,100
like really far up the Mississippi River
and things got really fucked.

3325
02:36:59,101 --> 02:37:01,890
It was like a two year winter crops 
failed.

3326
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:03,780
This was around like 18,
12 I think.

3327
02:37:04,050 --> 02:37:09,000
So an Icelandic volcano in 18,
12 caused a two year winter in America.

3328
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:16,640
It's just because they put so in the 
atmosphere

3329
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:21,380
that cools everything off.
Can we get a big fan and fix that shit?

3330
02:37:22,270 --> 02:37:24,890
You'd think something right below it on 
China.

3331
02:37:24,980 --> 02:37:29,980
Push it.
Another direction with that shine is 

3332
02:37:29,980 --> 02:37:29,980
already making the big fan to blow on 
us.

3333
02:37:29,980 --> 02:37:34,430
They probably got fans,
they're launching and space like a fan,

3334
02:37:34,431 --> 02:37:39,431
but with wings and it's going to just 
hover fan with a helicopter blade and 

3335
02:37:40,140 --> 02:37:45,140
just hovers up there and blows.
I don't think that any of these ideas 

3336
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:46,320
work.
Yeah,

3337
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:51,580
the natural disasters,
that one thing that people aren't 

3338
02:37:51,580 --> 02:37:51,580
prepared for that they don't.
You know,

3339
02:37:51,580 --> 02:37:52,400
everybody's worried about the government
collapsing.

3340
02:37:52,401 --> 02:37:54,560
Everybody's worried about the end of the
world and oh,

3341
02:37:54,561 --> 02:37:57,980
what if a dollar is useless,
which are really should worry about man,

3342
02:37:57,981 --> 02:38:00,440
it's fucking super volcanoes and 
asteroids.

3343
02:38:00,710 --> 02:38:02,470
Those are the big ones.
And this,

3344
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:06,800
if a super volcano in Iceland can cause 
a two year winter in America,

3345
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:12,070
what happens of yellowstone blows with 
what happens at that motherfucker takes 

3346
02:38:12,070 --> 02:38:15,050
off that species extinction time.

3347
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:18,260
It's weird.
It's like our society is.

3348
02:38:18,770 --> 02:38:23,770
It's so dependent upon this state of the
atmosphere staying the where it is,

3349
02:38:25,701 --> 02:38:30,701
but we have so much evidence shows that 
it really doesn't last and it changes 

3350
02:38:30,701 --> 02:38:31,020
radically all over the world.
And then,

3351
02:38:31,021 --> 02:38:36,021
you know,
different parts of the world are 

3352
02:38:36,021 --> 02:38:36,021
sometimes covered in ice and then a few 
million years later,

3353
02:38:36,021 --> 02:38:38,210
the tropical rain forest and you know,
what do you do?

3354
02:38:38,211 --> 02:38:40,370
You just,
I guess you just move and adopt,

3355
02:38:40,910 --> 02:38:41,660
moving,
adapt.

3356
02:38:41,661 --> 02:38:46,661
Rather there was a harvard,
a biologist or an astronomer rather 

3357
02:38:47,751 --> 02:38:52,751
recently that was saying that he doesn't
believe that he doesn't believe that we 

3358
02:38:52,751 --> 02:38:56,000
are a or he does believe rather than 
we're unique in that we're.

3359
02:38:56,030 --> 02:39:01,030
We're the only life form possibly in the
whole world that's like us and that our 

3360
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:05,051
situation is so rare with our ability to
have lasted this long protected by 

3361
02:39:05,901 --> 02:39:10,901
Jupiter.
All the asteroids are hitting Jupiter 

3362
02:39:10,901 --> 02:39:12,971
and that our environment has been so 
stable for so long that it's allowed 

3363
02:39:12,971 --> 02:39:16,701
this crazy explosion of intelligence and
innovation and that the odds of that 

3364
02:39:16,701 --> 02:39:20,801
actually happening anywhere else in the 
world or anywhere else in the universe 

3365
02:39:20,801 --> 02:39:20,801
are incredibly,
incredibly,

3366
02:39:20,801 --> 02:39:21,170
incredibly rare.

3367
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:23,610
And then.
But then you have to multiply that by an

3368
02:39:23,670 --> 02:39:26,280
infinite,
virtually infinite universe.

3369
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:30,870
And the fact that if you propose that 
other species in this virtually infinite

3370
02:39:30,871 --> 02:39:34,960
universe just started a bit earlier and 
they evolved to the point where they can

3371
02:39:34,961 --> 02:39:39,961
travel,
they are going to be the ones that 

3372
02:39:39,961 --> 02:39:39,961
traveled to us prior to us traveling to 
them

3373
02:39:39,961 --> 02:39:42,040
and they have legal mushrooms,
obviously.

3374
02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:45,280
Maybe they made mushrooms and they put 
'em on asteroids and send them our way.

3375
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:47,290
A little helping hand.
Well,

3376
02:39:47,291 --> 02:39:50,470
that scene a little pat on the butt.
That's the theory about how life on this

3377
02:39:51,220 --> 02:39:56,220
Panspermia Panspermia with mushrooms.
There was another show that I watched.

3378
02:39:57,061 --> 02:40:02,061
It's Morgan Freedman's show through the 
wormhole where this astrophysicists was 

3379
02:40:02,061 --> 02:40:06,751
explaining the infinite in that the 
universe is so big that there are the.

3380
02:40:07,270 --> 02:40:12,270
The odds are that there is an exact 
duplicate of you what the exact cells 

3381
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:20,040
and the exact life experiences and it's,
you know,

3382
02:40:20,430 --> 02:40:23,460
an infinite number of trillions of miles
away.

3383
02:40:23,461 --> 02:40:26,670
Like if you.
You can't even wrap your head around how

3384
02:40:26,671 --> 02:40:31,671
far away it is.
But infinity is so big that it means 

3385
02:40:31,671 --> 02:40:35,871
that the world as it exists today,
exactly what the exact adams in the 

3386
02:40:36,451 --> 02:40:40,650
exact order that the universe is so big 
that it could exist,

3387
02:40:40,890 --> 02:40:45,890
not just exist,
but exist in so many different forms 

3388
02:40:45,890 --> 02:40:49,760
that the exact creation of this earth,
the exact events that have taken place 

3389
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:53,990
all have been recreated on this

3390
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:55,680
planet.
There is a.

3391
02:40:55,770 --> 02:40:56,370
yeah,
there is.

3392
02:40:56,371 --> 02:41:01,371
I heard that in a different way saying 
that your actions echo in eternity 

3393
02:41:01,371 --> 02:41:06,140
because of that same thing,
because everything that you do now will 

3394
02:41:06,140 --> 02:41:10,071
be repeated just by the law of infinity 
by another you at another point in 

3395
02:41:11,281 --> 02:41:15,000
another time period in another universe 
or in the same one.

3396
02:41:15,210 --> 02:41:19,200
So it was the idea was that your actions
echo in eternity because those,

3397
02:41:19,500 --> 02:41:24,500
those impetuses,
the choices you make will be duplicated 

3398
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:26,190
in another experience.
And then that is crazy.

3399
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:31,250
Then there's the Uber Mind Fuck decision
universe scenario where every decision 

3400
02:41:31,250 --> 02:41:35,871
you make branches off and do a 
completely new in independent universe 

3401
02:41:35,871 --> 02:41:40,160
and they're all parallel existing and 
that every time you make a decision for 

3402
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:44,481
the positive or for the negative,
the entire universe is restructured 

3403
02:41:44,481 --> 02:41:48,621
around you and it's a completely new one
and that will any similarities to the 

3404
02:41:48,621 --> 02:41:53,241
previous universe or just just that 
similarities that you are existing in 

3405
02:41:53,241 --> 02:41:57,741
these new planes that have been 
recreated over and over and over again 

3406
02:41:57,741 --> 02:42:01,380
and that life,
much like we see in when you break the 

3407
02:42:02,011 --> 02:42:07,011
world down to subatomic particles and 
then break it and bring it all the way 

3408
02:42:07,011 --> 02:42:10,851
up to universes and galaxies,
that the universe and it's moments are 

3409
02:42:11,581 --> 02:42:16,581
fractal as well,
and they are also infinite and that in 

3410
02:42:16,581 --> 02:42:17,250
these decisions,
in moments,

3411
02:42:17,251 --> 02:42:22,251
you create infinite universes.
I get so crazy,

3412
02:42:23,250 --> 02:42:26,700
but the universe itself is so crazy.
Why is that any crazier?

3413
02:42:27,060 --> 02:42:32,060
You know,
why is it any crazier than an infinite 

3414
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:32,850
universe?
Why is that any crazier than hundreds of

3415
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:33,250
billions of galaxies,
Wyoming?

3416
02:42:33,570 --> 02:42:36,690
It's all fucking crazy.
Like you can't wrap your head around and

3417
02:42:36,691 --> 02:42:37,110
you're like,
Hey,

3418
02:42:37,111 --> 02:42:40,740
I have 150 acres of Oh well fucking whip
the shit.

3419
02:42:40,741 --> 02:42:42,930
The Universe is infinite and what's 150 
acres?

3420
02:42:42,931 --> 02:42:43,830
That doesn't mean anything

3421
02:42:44,650 --> 02:42:49,650
to explore these topics.
I remember there was a philosophical 

3422
02:42:49,650 --> 02:42:52,171
conundrum in which the philosopher says,
I can prove to you that if I shoot an 

3423
02:42:52,171 --> 02:42:55,780
Arrow at a target that it will never hit
the target and here's how they do it.

3424
02:42:55,990 --> 02:42:58,570
At a certain point,
the Arrow would be halfway to the target

3425
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:01,990
and that takes a certain amount of time.
At another point the Arrow will be,

3426
02:43:01,991 --> 02:43:03,430
you know.
Then you take the next half,

3427
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:05,800
so at a certain that the next half 
point,

3428
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:07,870
that will also take a certain amount of 
time.

3429
02:43:08,170 --> 02:43:10,870
Then you take the next half point to 
where it's halfway to the.

3430
02:43:11,470 --> 02:43:12,190
That'll take another

3431
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:17,190
amount of time while there's always 
going to be another half point which is 

3432
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:21,751
going to have a time value and so if 
there's a continuous amount of time 

3433
02:43:21,751 --> 02:43:26,050
value in the half point of distance 
moved by a coworker by whatever,

3434
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:30,550
infinite a measurement by that logic.
The arrows should never hit the target,

3435
02:43:31,150 --> 02:43:32,470
and you start to think about that.
You're like,

3436
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:33,790
Huh,
yeah,

3437
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:39,000
that's fucked up.
That's some hippie bullshit that hit 

3438
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:39,000
that target.
Exactly.

3439
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,550
That's what we all know has never been 
bowhunting.

3440
02:43:41,930 --> 02:43:46,930
Need to get with Ted nugent and say,
get out your fancy graph and watch this 

3441
02:43:46,930 --> 02:43:49,560
bitch.
See Your theory sucks.

3442
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:51,340
A fat deck,
because that's a dead deer.

3443
02:43:51,430 --> 02:43:56,430
That's right,
and there used to be in those 

3444
02:43:56,430 --> 02:43:56,430
philosophical debates,
there will be people,

3445
02:43:56,430 --> 02:43:59,611
especially in the skeptical debate.
There was one famous instance where I 

3446
02:43:59,611 --> 02:44:01,300
think someone just slap someone in the 
face that you think you think nothing is

3447
02:44:01,301 --> 02:44:06,301
real.
How about this back and just hit one of 

3448
02:44:06,301 --> 02:44:06,520
the skeptics in the face like that was 
real,

3449
02:44:06,521 --> 02:44:11,521
wasn't it?
I just started fucking around with too 

3450
02:44:11,521 --> 02:44:11,521
many.
Whatever got slapped away.

3451
02:44:11,540 --> 02:44:13,540
It goes.
There are too many

3452
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:19,180
10 minutes.
That means we're going to wrap this 

3453
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:19,180
bitch up and bring it home.
Aubrey.

3454
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:19,350
Marcus,
you are a bad motherfucker.

3455
02:44:19,370 --> 02:44:21,410
Thank you very much.
My friends coming here.

3456
02:44:21,411 --> 02:44:23,450
It was awesome.
Was We went on a double date last night.

3457
02:44:25,090 --> 02:44:27,200
That was powerful.
A good times,

3458
02:44:27,201 --> 02:44:27,800
man.
And,

3459
02:44:27,801 --> 02:44:28,880
uh,
we'll uh,

3460
02:44:28,910 --> 02:44:33,910
we'll move on with many,
many new things in the future and I 

3461
02:44:33,910 --> 02:44:33,910
think,
uh,

3462
02:44:33,910 --> 02:44:34,670
I think this hunting thing is a good 
idea.

3463
02:44:34,830 --> 02:44:39,830
Yeah,
I think there's something to explore in 

3464
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:39,830
that.
It can be revolution,

3465
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:39,830
at least.
Gentlemen.

3466
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:40,470
Absolutely play.
It plays out.

3467
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:41,940
Well,
that'll get us kicked off youtube.

3468
02:44:41,941 --> 02:44:46,941
Don't do it.
So people want to check some more stuff 

3469
02:44:46,941 --> 02:44:46,941
out for me.
Warrior poet.us

3470
02:44:46,941 --> 02:44:51,590
at warrior poets,
my twitter and I also put out a new 

3471
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:51,590
video inspired by the style of Jason 
Silva.

3472
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:56,241
You can
get to 
that@vimeodotcomslashwarriorpoetthatUSworriedaboutusorwhatisawarrior.com

3473
02:44:58,890 --> 02:45:01,470
bringing me giant,
a giant

3474
02:45:01,990 --> 02:45:02,920
video.
It's really fun.

3475
02:45:02,921 --> 02:45:07,921
I love,
I think the world of feeds off of 

3476
02:45:07,921 --> 02:45:11,580
inspiration to a certain extent.
Anytime you could do something like 

3477
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:11,580
that,
that is a little burst.

3478
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:14,680
And Jason Silva,
I just retweeted one of his day.

3479
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:16,300
What a fucking great guy.
He is,

3480
02:45:16,301 --> 02:45:17,470
man.
If you met him in person.

3481
02:45:17,471 --> 02:45:22,471
I have,
I'd like to know what next time he does 

3482
02:45:22,471 --> 02:45:24,541
a podcast.
He'll be back on somewhere towards the 

3483
02:45:24,541 --> 02:45:25,210
end of February I think.
I think you said the end of February and

3484
02:45:25,211 --> 02:45:30,211
when he does,
we'll have you on with him because he a 

3485
02:45:30,211 --> 02:45:30,730
fucking beautiful human being.
Oh actually,

3486
02:45:30,731 --> 02:45:31,330
April.
Okay.

3487
02:45:31,331 --> 02:45:32,960
He'll be back in April.
So,

3488
02:45:32,961 --> 02:45:33,740
uh,
we're going to have for me,

3489
02:45:33,741 --> 02:45:37,080
I think he's in New York City right now.
Bang a bunch of smart bit

3490
02:45:39,310 --> 02:45:40,540
yet.
I'm Jason.

3491
02:45:41,370 --> 02:45:46,370
Thank you everybody.
I know we were supposed to have rick 

3492
02:45:46,370 --> 02:45:48,771
Ross in today,
but arby's only in town for a couple of 

3493
02:45:48,771 --> 02:45:51,440
days,
so we had to switch it around and rick 

3494
02:45:51,440 --> 02:45:53,241
will be joined us one week from today.
So next Wednesday we'll have the real 

3495
02:45:53,241 --> 02:45:55,830
rick Ross,
the real rick Ross who is not a rapper.

3496
02:45:56,100 --> 02:46:01,100
He is a former criminal who's now a 
fucking great guy and a community 

3497
02:46:01,100 --> 02:46:01,950
activist and an interesting character 
with a great story.

3498
02:46:02,190 --> 02:46:06,390
We'll have tim ferriss on Tuesday.
Tim Ferris will be returning and Monday,

3499
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:11,440
and I know I'm going backwards,
but Monday we have Alex honnold on the 

3500
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:13,490
podcast who is the number one free solo 
climber in the world.

3501
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:15,770
He's,
if you've not seen this cat,

3502
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:20,800
you have to watch his videos.
You will shit your pants if you one of 

3503
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:24,761
those people like me that just gets 
squeamish at like ridiculous heights 

3504
02:46:24,761 --> 02:46:25,340
when people do nutty shit.

3505
02:46:25,490 --> 02:46:30,490
This guy free solo climbs places where 
no one else can do it and it is fucking 

3506
02:46:30,591 --> 02:46:32,930
insane.
He climbs things that go this way,
