1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello friends and fuck
faces and even fuck faces.

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:07,794
You can be a friend.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,640
Just get it together.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,530
Stop being a fuck face.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,473
Is that possible?

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,770
Or continue to be a fuck
face if that's your thing,

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,240
who might tell you what to do?

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,850
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast brought to you by squarespace.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,720
Squarespace is a website that allows you
to build websites and allows you to do

10
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,721
it in a way that a moron like me could
actually make a website if you could do

11
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,060
the normal functions of,

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,570
of using a computer,

13
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,860
like clicking on icons,

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,461
dragging,

15
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,540
selecting pictures,

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,520
dragging shit,

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,900
click and drag it pitch.

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,500
Um,

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,310
if you do that,

20
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,851
you can,

21
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:42,090
uh,

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,700
you can make an awesome website and
it looks incredibly professional.

23
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,770
Twenty bad ass designs,

24
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,290
custom images and
content that you provide.

25
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:49,561
You can,

26
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:49,740
you know,

27
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,521
you can use your own style,

28
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:51,540
have to use their images.

29
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,780
They have 24 slash seven super fast
email support and they also have a new

30
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,880
ecommerce product so you could start
a website and start a store with

31
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,410
squarespace.com really quickly.

32
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,020
And their new product is Galapagos.

33
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:10,230
It's a new template that will showcase
your ecommerce products in a more

34
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:14,730
interesting way than the typical ordinary
grid and galapagos features a dynamic

35
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,070
product mosaic with
custom role overstates.

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,320
So like if you put your
cursor over something,

37
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,280
the image changes,

38
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,940
so if you hover when the
visitors hover over each item,

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,530
the you can have like a one color,

40
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:29,490
one black and white and make it fancy
and the template is also preset.

41
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:34,410
With all the content pages you need to
have your shop up and running quickly.

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:34,981
Musicians,

43
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:35,940
it's great for musicians.

44
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,960
You can sell music,

45
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:41,310
digital downloads and merchandise and
you could set up a calendar like really

46
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:41,580
easy.

47
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,060
It's,

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,710
I mean it's,

49
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,630
it's really like,

50
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,720
it can't recommend it.

51
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,590
Enough of her.

52
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,640
No persons that we have recommended
this to have come back and said a

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,840
squarespace is bullshit.

54
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,400
Everybody that uses it.

55
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,380
So that's a really fucking cool website.

56
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,240
We're going to do some sort of a contest,

57
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,600
a,

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,770
I need to get with a square space.

59
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:01,370

00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,680
squarespace blood.

62
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,520

75
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,860
This is the holiday seasons,

76
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,580
ladies and gentlemen.

77
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,570
Christmases here.

78
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,404
I think [inaudible].

79
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,630
Is it era past?

80
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,430
How's that worked?

81
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,310
I think it's over.

82
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,110
It's over.

83
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,943
It's over.

84
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,190
You can still buy someone flowers.

85
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:50,761
It doesn't have to be.

86
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:52,410
Hanukkah flowers are just cool.

87
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,880
They're nature's masterpieces.

88
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,631
They're beautiful,

89
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,141
they're cool,

90
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,090
they smell good and they
make checks feel better.

91
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,020
For some strange reason,

92
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,920
if a dude buys you flowers,

93
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,970
you might want to have to sit down
and I would talk with him though,

94
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,760
is reality in a way?

95
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,280
No,

96
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,700
no.

97
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,151
Just let them,

98
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:05,760
you know,

99
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,310
it's known to be.

100
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,091
Need to be scared.

101
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:07,580
Brian,

102
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,770
you contributing to fear.

103
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,761
Just tell him,

104
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,430
hey man and roses are horrible.

105
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,430
Like get some other flower girls
didn't are done with roses I think.

106
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,263
Not think so.

107
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,840
Every time I get roses for a girl,

108
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:17,260
they're like,

109
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,870
what are you like 1992
just talking to you.

110
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,680
Yeah,

111
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,300
probably one 800 flowers has a.

112
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,130
They have a Christmas
centerpiece that you can get.

113
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,000
The Christmas centerpiece
is this huge thing.

114
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,700
Like can you go to one 800 flowers
and see their Christmas centerpiece.

115
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,030
So all of these beautiful
flowers are cool as fuck.

116
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,150
I mean it's really weird what beauty
is when you stop thinking about it.

117
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:44,470
Like why are we drawn to particular
plants and to particular sunsets and

118
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,251
sunrises.

119
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,430
Like what is it about beautiful things
that's so appealing and attractive and

120
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,690
what it does to us.

121
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,570
That sense of too weird.

122
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,630
So weird aspect of being a human that
I don't think animals share living.

123
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:56,930
They do.

124
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,470
They just can't talk about them.

125
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,460
I know I've used these guys a lot.

126
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:00,851
By the way,

127
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,090
Joe.

128
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,210
I've used one 800 flowers at time
and they are a great company.

129
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,700
Yeah,

130
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,430
they have a great reputation and the
flowers are beautiful and expertly crafted

131
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:13,750
by local florists and hand delivered
to your door so they have like a whole

132
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,770
network of people that they use all over
the country that are excellent florists

133
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:21,280
so they get it to you quickly filled
with red roses and white lilies and more

134
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,380
this bright seasonal centerpiece.

135
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,630
It's accented with fragrant evergreens,

136
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,441
pine cones,

137
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,600
and topped off with a red
velvet ribbon and candles.

138
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,070
If you want to convince a girl
that you're gay kid or this.

139
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,290
This is what I love and I
would love it if you got me.

140
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,310
Mike got me this and I was so happy.

141
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,293
Who's Mike?

142
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,250
You know the guy in the
office and I really like.

143
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,530
Anyway,

144
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,260
I wonder if they have like a service
because this would be cool to always have

145
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,720
fresh flowers that it's kind of like
they just automatically send you like a

146
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,060
thing of flowers every week.

147
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,310
Sure.

148
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,110
He could do that.

149
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,190
I know businesses do that.

150
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,690
They have deals with florists,

151
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,021
you know,

152
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,850
some businesses that
really appreciate flowers.

153
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,780
They work out deals,

154
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,703
smart move.

155
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,360
Yeah.

156
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,700
You know,

157
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,780
people love that shit.

158
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,860
If you're in that business,

159
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:04,510
like say if you're a dentist
or something like that,

160
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,141
you know,

161
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:05,974
people will like,

162
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,550
they'll actually enjoy your place
better if you have flowers there.

163
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,883
It was bizarre,

164
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,033
but it's true.

165
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,540
Uh,

166
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,600

Shit.

187
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,360
I haven't even looked into this
all in one daily Greens mix.

188
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,570
I was taking a daily
Greens miss mix for awhile,

189
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,670
but I ran out of it and I got lazy but
it was good to like add to water and just

190
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,620
make sure making sure that
you get your phytonutrients,

191
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,653

192
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,260
your vegetables.

193
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh,

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,180
because of the website
more as move movement.

195
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,110
They did a good job.

196
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,280
Whoever does this website,

197
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,430
it's on point on.

198
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,850
It has a variety of things.

199
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,923
The website,

200
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,900
the best way to describe it is
it's a human optimization website.

201
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,600
We sell kettle bells and battle ropes,

202
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,040
protein powders.

203
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,370
That's from the finest hemp we.

204
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,180
We sell blenders to make smoothies.

205
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,470
We just sell all shit than we like shit
that we think is good and ask for the

206
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,304
supplements.

207
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,720
If you use the code named Brogan,

208
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,540
you will save 10 percent
of any and all supplements.

209
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,623
Are you folks?

210
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,970
That's enough for this Lee campus here.

211
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:48,680
At least gentlemen.

212
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,700
Cue The music prime.

213
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,320
Well again,

214
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,560
experience Joe Rogan podcast,

215
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,490
the camp as been side smiles layer.

216
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,250
You were on Fox News once upon a time.

217
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,901
Made it in there.

218
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:10,860
Did it smell like sulfur?

219
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,480
It's about like souls.

220
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,980
Why are the girls that worked there so
fucking hot cause they know how to hire

221
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:17,281
people.

222
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:18,720
Apparently this insane.

223
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:19,570
They're way too high.

224
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:22,290
It's not fair because
men will agree with them.

225
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,890
Just to hope that they will
say yeah and high five you.

226
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,090
You'll change your whole
philosophy and there's.

227
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,970
You can find clips on youtube where
people just put together every time they

228
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,730
open their legs during
the various segments.

229
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,910
Praise the Lord there too hot.

230
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,773
It's unfair.

231
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,980
That's like hypnosis.

232
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,210
You know some of those.

233
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,260
What was that woman's Megan?

234
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:40,651
What's her name?

235
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:41,960
The really angry when Meghan Kelly,

236
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,830
she's so fucking hot.

237
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:43,664
It's ridiculous.

238
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,360
Whereas she show me some Meghan Kelly.

239
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,400
This is a.

240
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,521
Oh,

241
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:46,891
this is.

242
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:47,020
Yeah.

243
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,853
This is really cool.

244
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,520
Play this because this is
how I found out about Lee,

245
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,360
but back it up.

246
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,030
So I'm sure you guys are going to have
a lot more jokes for the rest of the

247
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:54,864
campaign here.

248
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,890
They just keep going.

249
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,730
Can I.

250
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,780
Can I just ask a question?

251
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,550
Sure.

252
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,800
What,

253
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,270
what is Fox News?

254
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,260
It's just a parade of propaganda and that
it's just that it's just a festival of

255
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:05,050
ignorance.

256
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,770
What people did in Iraq.

257
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,430
Come on.

258
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,300
This is ridiculous.

259
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:10,290
What's the point of this?

260
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,710
Go outside.

261
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,310
Go,

262
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,551
go.

263
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:16,384
Hug Me.

264
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,650
Well,

265
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,720
you love your family.

266
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,880
You know

267
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,630
snooze.

268
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:24,900
All right.

269
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,190
Thanks.

270
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,023
Is the best.

271
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,650
Watch this.

272
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,140
Keep it on.

273
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,280
It was the best part.

274
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,340
We're also captain Kirk this morning
because it's Saturday morning and fun.

275
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,140
Greg cushiest job in the world.

276
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,381
Yeah.

277
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,270
Look who just beamed aboard right now.

278
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,040
The ladies from the Star Ship Enterprise.

279
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,760
Hello.

280
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,350
Welcome.

281
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,160
This four hot chicks in an outfit.

282
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,610
I just wrote a new book on Captain
Kirk and the way he was able to.

283
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:47,910
Woo.

284
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,743
Beautiful.

285
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,920
It's a book about Kevin couldn't get laid,

286
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,320
but come on the fictional
character captain kirk too,

287
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:55,850
by the way.

288
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,040
Not

289
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,810
Even William Shatner tell all book
I was in the green room within.

290
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,100
I could not figure out why
there were these women there.

291
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,010
I had no idea that you just.

292
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,580
It was almost like it was scripted
because you said that and then they showed

293
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,930
you was the most inane,

294
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,190
stupid piece of shit.

295
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,870
I didn't even know that
was coming up next.

296
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,411
Oh my God.

297
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,221
It was perfect.

298
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:14,940
You couldn't have been.

299
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,050
What if they went to some
series news and fucked,

300
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,970
you know,

301
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,661
he wanted to.

302
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,640
You could see in his face
as he read the teleprompter,

303
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,091
he was like,

304
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:21,361
all right,

305
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,850
we're going to get out
of this and go ah shit.

306
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,330
And it's like completely
proved your point.

307
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,040
Like right away,

308
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,241
like,

309
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,074
come on man.

310
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,560
How did Kirk get laid?

311
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,431
He could skip.

312
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:33,720
Really wrote did he got laid.

313
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:35,220
The writers made him get laid down.

314
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,113
A real guy.

315
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,890
Jesus fucking aliens to wars going on.

316
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:44,190
The entire banking system had to
be bailed out by taxpayers' money.

317
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,320
He was running aliens.

318
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,250
They just wanted to see
what a human cock was like.

319
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,210
That's how he got laid.

320
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,270
Do you think they have like a bunch of
shit that they will throw out there,

321
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:55,230
like beach balls to distract and they
get like they get it from the CIA every

322
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,064
week.

323
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,030
Star Trek check.

324
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,630
You just have to send it this way.

325
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,160
We want you to talk about this
week like Zap the American mind.

326
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,320
No,

327
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,560
no,

328
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:04,970
no,

329
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,210
no,

330
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,780
no,

331
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,613
no.

332
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,633
You know what I mean?

333
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,150
I don't believe that it is.

334
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,720
I don't believe.

335
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,970
I think I tend to think that it's
more in competence than conspiracy.

336
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,360
I conspiracy ratings.

337
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,010
They don't actually care about the news.

338
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:18,150
They only care about ratings.

339
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,110
They don't care about the news,

340
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,700
but I think in general,

341
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:25,701
like even the most of what we think of
as being this big gigantic conspiracy

342
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:30,981
with our government and the media is more
in competence and Horesh behavior than

343
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:31,710
anything.

344
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,820
Just they're prostitutes.

345
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,420
Prostituted themselves out because that's
where they got the good assignments.

346
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,290
They got to the good places.

347
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,400
They got the big ratings.

348
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,061
I mean,

349
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:39,920
you don't get to that

350
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,230
point.

351
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,890
You don't get to that job unless you've
proved yourself a faithful foot soldier

352
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,380
to whatever their messages generally,

353
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,710
you know,

354
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,340
they're not,

355
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,330
you're not gonna get hired on.

356
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,400
Yeah.

357
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,720
And even guys that used
to be Kinda like rebels,

358
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,040
like Geraldo Rivera rather rivera
was kind of a rebel at one point.

359
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,210
He was the guy that had Dick Gregory on
TV and film for the first time I got in

360
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,560
a fistfight at a KKK rally,

361
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,401
I think on a show.

362
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,960
If someone hit him in
the head with a chair,

363
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,060
they might not even
been trying to hit him.

364
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:12,240
It was just a melee and I think a chair
went flying and he got his nose broken

365
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:12,901
and he was fucked up.

366
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:13,740
But then he was so excited,

367
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,230
so excited to have actual cut on his face.

368
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,350
I'm a tough guy.

369
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,100
Like what's.

370
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,570
He was supposed to box frank stallone
or something crazy like that too,

371
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,070
a long time ago.

372
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,581
Oh my God.

373
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:24,600
They might have actually done it.

374
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,823
I don't know.

375
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,611
I'm pretty sure,

376
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,720
but he's a wild dude,

377
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,340
or at least he was a wild dude,

378
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,121
you know,

379
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,580
and now he's just like Fox News puppet.

380
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,450
It's weird when you see the,

381
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,660
the ones that actually stick

382
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,201
to their guns,

383
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,430
they don't last long.

384
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,620
I mean Cenk Yoga lasted two
months at Msnbc before he,

385
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,750
before he needed to leave.

386
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:45,590
Amber Lyon is another one that left
because her Bahrain story actually you

387
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,424
mentioned Bahrain,

388
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:46,820
uh,

389
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,630
CNN,

390
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,820
she brought it back to them and said
this is what's going on by rain.

391
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:53,580
But they were doing ads talking about how
great Bahrain was and wouldn't play or

392
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,423
segment.

393
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:54,890
Yeah.

394
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,140
She,

395
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,610
she's

396
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,610
podcasts before and she
explained it all to us and it's,

397
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:02,390
it's so hard to believe that what
we consider to be like a shining,

398
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,160
revered institution of news,

399
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:07,810
like CNN has just a bullshit
propaganda wing that they,

400
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,470
they're capable of that kind of behavior.

401
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,520
If she's telling the truth.

402
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,330
I don't know.

403
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,163
I wasn't there.

404
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,070
I assume she is.

405
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,060
She seems very honest.

406
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,280
I don't know anybody else's
side on the other side.

407
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:16,801
I don't know.

408
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,470
I don't know what the
fuck is really going on,

409
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,500
so I probably shouldn't comment
on what CNN did or didn't do,

410
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:24,200
but I know for a fact they're
not reporting a lot of shit.

411
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,240
We're putting a lot of shit and I
feel like all of these networks,

412
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,160
that mainstream media,

413
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:32,450
it's a very small box of accepted
thought that is allowed on them.

414
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,190
It's not.

415
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,760
It's not.

416
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,110
They're not going to go either very far
to to either side or outside that box.

417
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,130
No,

418
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,650
it's not

419
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,400
really the news and that's one of the
more interesting things about the internet

420
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,940
is because the Internet now,

421
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:48,390
there's all these sources
that are like more real news,

422
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:51,150
like they're telling you about shit
that's going on that you might not have

423
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:51,700
known.

424
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,700
I could just see this thing about the
CIA dude who's a fake CIA guy for like 10

425
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:57,950
years.

426
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,380
No,

427
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,561
here,

428
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,970
let me pull it up when I can.

429
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,380
If I can get a chance here,

430
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:06,381
but I think that what we're seeing now
with the Internet and with just this

431
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,690
incredible influx of like
daily information about life,

432
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:12,571
about science,

433
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:14,450
about the real reality of

434
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,473
people don't.

435
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,291
People are waking up.

436
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,400
I mean it is slow.

437
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,031
It's a slow,

438
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,050
painful process,

439
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:19,650
but uh,

440
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,010
it's.

441
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,880
People are waking up.

442
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:21,300
I mean,

443
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,560
I mean with Syria,

444
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:26,130
that was the first time I've ever seen
our war machine and our media war machine

445
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:28,470
get it into high gear
and people were like,

446
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,540
I don't think we need to
bomb the shit out of Syria.

447
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,830
Listened and yeah,

448
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:32,281
no shit,

449
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:32,461
right?

450
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:32,710
That,

451
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,960
we were talking about that the other day.

452
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,823
At the

453
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,050
first time that,

454
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,160
that really did happen.

455
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,881
The public said,

456
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:39,181
fuck,

457
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:40,320
this guy went,

458
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:40,781
oh yeah,

459
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:41,191
Syria,

460
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:42,170
we don't need to go there.

461
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:42,691
Come on.

462
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:42,871
I mean,

463
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:46,200
we were just saying we just wanted
to see what you guys thought.

464
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,250
So sweat this dude,

465
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,970
this guy,

466
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,290
the EPA is highest paid employee and a
leading expert in climate change deserves

467
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,400
to go to prison for at least 30 months
for lying to his bosses and saying that

468
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:01,401
he was a CIA spy working in Pakistan so
that he could avoid doing his real job

469
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,750
says the federal prosecutors.

470
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,800
So the dude,

471
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,600
how slick is this cat?

472
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,090
He tells his people at the fucking.

473
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,440
He goes,

474
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,090
he's works for the EPA,

475
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:13,860
the highest paid climate expert.

476
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,731
And they go,

477
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:14,851
well,

478
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:16,290
we want you to do a lot of
studies on climate change.

479
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,440
Like,

480
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,860
listen,

481
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,840
I would love to work for the
CIA is a protecting America.

482
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,410
Meanwhile,

483
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,280
he was just making it up,

484
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,620
but he did it for the longest time,

485
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,410
like this guy built them out of
a million dollars over a decade.

486
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,820
I say more power to them.

487
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:33,260
There's a drift in the
system and use it again.

488
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,500
It's like it's more than
competence than it is anything.

489
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,090
It's more human horesh behavior.

490
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,510
It's greed than it is for example.

491
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,400
But I have to work for the CIA.

492
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,360
What can I tell you?

493
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,723
My hands are tied.

494
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,380
You have to just invent
that you're a CIA operative.

495
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,440
How many fakes

496
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,010
I operators out there like dudes are
trying to impress chicks and it's amazing.

497
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,050
Especially with homeland,

498
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,220
it's probably jumped up quite a bit.

499
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,230
Can you prove to us that you're seeing.

500
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,370
I would love to,

501
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,450
but it's top secret.

502
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,870
Have you would have to be
sequestered and that's the thing.

503
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,311
Look,

504
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:07,144
I can't.

505
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,940
I'm working for the.

506
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm trying to save America.

507
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,490
I know it looks like I'm
on facebook 23 hours a day.

508
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:14,300
But uh,

509
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,481
yeah,

510
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,550
they checked his cell phone like texting,

511
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,540
like 20 different chicks.

512
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,261
What's going on man?

513
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,000
You weren't really
working on climate change.

514
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,680
It was just getting mad cash.

515
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,600
Just bawling every night going strip
clubs for all parties at the house.

516
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,351
Uh,

517
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:27,380
it's a lot of you porn,

518
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:30,200
but you point is actually
a front for a CIA website.

519
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,180
So making sure that the
really dark stuff doesn't.

520
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,760
I watched the,

521
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,270
you know,

522
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:35,640
the ain't no.

523
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,070
We have to allow a certain amount.

524
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,900
I am horrified by the gaping.

525
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,180
We have to allow a certain amount.

526
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:42,110
If we don't allow it,

527
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,260
then we're gonna lose a lot of the
people that would be with us against this

528
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:45,520
child.

529
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,700
My job to measure the diameter of the
gate because if it gets beyond a certain

530
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:50,510
point,

531
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,790
if we start getting officers
like we gotta cancel the program,

532
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,680
they've seen some of the,

533
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,541
first of all,

534
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,480
think of the size of an ostrich egg and
that's nothing compared the size of some

535
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:00,314
of these people's butts.

536
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,560
You know that they like least
stretch them out in these videos.

537
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,810
Have you been to IFEC Joe Website?

538
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,500
He fucked.

539
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,880
No,

540
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
it was all just really horrible shit.

541
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,081
It's like that.

542
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,460
It's like so many pink socks,

543
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:12,950
like people getting stocks coming out,

544
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,390
girls pooping while having sex.

545
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:14,970
Well,

546
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,720
that's the weird thing is
not just that that exists,

547
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,680
it's that we kind of are not even a little
bit surprised at that exists because

548
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,430
we all know that the natural tendency
of human beings is to escalate.

549
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,800
We just escalate and
if a guy can put it in,

550
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:28,910
your mouth is going to go.

551
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:29,320
What about your,

552
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,610
but just even know why he wants to do it.

553
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,440
What other holes do you have to offer?

554
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:34,430
I mean when,

555
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,390
when people are,

556
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:36,224
uh,

557
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,090
you know,

558
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,740
obsessed with anything,

559
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,360
whether it's sex or
technology or whatever,

560
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,263
whatever it is,

561
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,280
you're going to try to take
that thing to the highest level.

562
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,420
Like they're making a mustang.

563
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,880
Now there's a mustang you
could buy from the factory.

564
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,160
It's 670 horsepower.

565
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,170
That's ridiculous.

566
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,030
That's absolutely insane.

567
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,260
It's a shelby gt,

568
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:57,741
500.

569
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,970
It's got like 668 something horses.

570
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:00,681
Where do you use that?

571
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,110
Just the salt flats on the salt flats.

572
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:04,100
It goes 200 miles an hour.

573
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:04,851
It's a mustang.

574
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:08,330
It's one of the craziest things that
anyone's ever offered for sale because it

575
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,320
doesn't even handle good.

576
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,910
I mean it's really like an old muscle car.

577
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,620
It has something called a live axle,

578
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,730
which is essentially like a log
that keeps your wheels on it.

579
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:17,570
So just one big fat.

580
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,440
They don't do that anymore.

581
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:21,020
They do independent real suspension
so that when you hit bumps,

582
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,160
your car adjusts.

583
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:23,810
Our tendency is to see how far it can go.

584
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,470
I mean look at our nuclear
bomb arsenal like w,

585
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:26,990
what was it?

586
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,260
100 nuclear bombs would destroy the
planet and we've got like several thousand

587
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,400
just in case.

588
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,690
Just in case you bitches know.

589
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,411
We're serious.

590
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,244
Serious.

591
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,601
Yeah.

592
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:36,230
We're weird.

593
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,820
People are weird and
I think go to the end.

594
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,290
We escalate things.

595
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,580
If you know for gambling,

596
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,740
you don't know if you
become a blackjack addict,

597
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,360
you don't pay for $5 a hand.

598
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,440
You want to go to 50,

599
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,400
you want to go to 100.

600
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,760
I got 500 really feel that fucking crazy
rush and they tell you that like once

601
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:52,320
you get addicted to that rush,

602
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,640
you can't take that back.

603
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,660
Like you can't go from $5,000 to
betting a dollar and getting thrilled.

604
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,621
You won't care.

605
00:17:58,621 --> 00:17:59,760
You get angry at yourself,

606
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,271
you know,

607
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,770
it's a weird thing that happens to you.

608
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,410
We were,

609
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,020
we're like meant to escalate.

610
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,810
So you know,

611
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,420
you see those gaping
videos and you're like,

612
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,254
Yep,

613
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,253
I got it.

614
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,410
I see whether they are just makes sense.

615
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:11,460
We're fucking crazy.

616
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,160
I think it like the,

617
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,610
the whole anal thing always like I always
wondered why people wanted to do anal,

618
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,750
but some people like it.

619
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,080
Yeah.

620
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,520
But I could.

621
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I could see if.

622
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,340
Have you ever been with one of
those girls where you're like,

623
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,570
their pussy does feel like very,

624
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,600
like there's a lot of extra
baggage or like room in there.

625
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,330
I mean it's just like,

626
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,470
you know when you have a larger vagina,

627
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,210
it's just like almost wow.

628
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,380
I would imagine the vagina,

629
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,250
it's just like penises,

630
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:35,521
Brian.

631
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:36,354
They vary in size.

632
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,640
Just if I was married to a girl like that,

633
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:40,231
I would get all right.

634
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:43,410
We're doing anal more often
than you don't say it like that.

635
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,620
You're going to clean your room or
we're taking away your allowance.

636
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
You wouldn't say it like
that or I know that,

637
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,490
but you know that.

638
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,190
I'm not going to say why
because I'm saying to you,

639
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,250
if you're saying it to hurt,

640
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,030
you tend to be somebody who you're not to.

641
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:00,331
To her,

642
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:03,950
I'd get her like one of those centerpiece
baskets from 100 flowers and come on

643
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,350
down the car.

644
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,550
Your Vagina's joke answer.

645
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,910
It's the number one thing when 100
flowers is used for anal makeup,

646
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,280
for Anal and to comfort
women with enormous vagina.

647
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,090
You have a special on the anal basket.

648
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,090
No passcode.

649
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,570
So we get an Anal Fox news girls.

650
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,433
Why they're so hot.

651
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,810
Those girls are so God damn hot.

652
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,250
Like I don't want to marry them.

653
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,600
I don't want to have
relationships with them.

654
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,440
But if I was a single man I would be
very attracted to those angry bitches

655
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,530
or the weathermen in La.

656
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,341
I just think there's.

657
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,570
So there's so,

658
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:34,710
like aggressive.

659
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,480
I don't know if they're so strong.

660
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,670
They're so stern in their opinion.

661
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:38,931
Yeah.

662
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:40,100
Most of them are not dumb.

663
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,180
It has nothing to do with dme.

664
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,840
No.

665
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,340
Just said about those mean bitches just
because I'm a glutton for punishment.

666
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,540
But if you,

667
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,290
um,

668
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,340
like when you're on that show,

669
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:49,701
like what,

670
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:49,910
what,

671
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,380
what is it like when
you're in that studio,

672
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,191
does it feel weird?

673
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,024
Do you feel like.

674
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,541
Well that's the thing.

675
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,000
It's like

676
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
some just seem like
they're doing their job.

677
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:55,741
I mean,

678
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:55,891
yeah,

679
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:56,970
they worked for the evil empire,

680
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,720
but they don't,

681
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,340
they're just like whatever
gets them through the day.

682
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:02,500
Oh I need to say this thing and this
thing and then when we wrap for the day,

683
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:02,970
like,

684
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,790
so I had to remind myself why it
was important for me to do that.

685
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,201
I like read,

686
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,430
read an article about how
million people died in Iraq.

687
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,210
I mean this was,

688
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,160
this was several years back and uh,

689
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,263
and you know,

690
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
cause you don't want to fuck up the show.

691
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,520
Like I felt like I needed to do and
I only wanted to be on there once.

692
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:18,960
I was like having me on.

693
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,210
It's going to be a one time thing

694
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,263
it says yet,

695
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,541
dude,

696
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:21,750
it was,

697
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,700
if you were like a publicity
whore and I know you're not,

698
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:24,840
but there'll be an awesome move.

699
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,733
I mean it worked out.

700
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,580
I never thought it was
7:00 AM on a Saturday.

701
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,260
I truly thought the only people,

702
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,640
and this was four or five years ago,

703
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:32,001
we're not.

704
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,710
Everything on the news went online.

705
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,820
I truly thought that the
only people seeing it would
fox news fans at 7:00 AM on

706
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,240
a Saturday and instead it went up
online and viral and all that shit.

707
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:41,510
Man,

708
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,010
if you got something relevant to say,

709
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:43,970
the Internet will catch it.

710
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,480
Yeah.

711
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,150
They'll find it and they'll
put it out there to go back.

712
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,900
That girl like standing and
sitting there with her legs open.

713
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,140
This is insane.

714
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:58,290
I just want to point something out of how
we are so weird like as a culture that

715
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,810
this is a part of normal
everyday office life.

716
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,490
Like we've got to make
some decisions here.

717
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,230
Like look at this woman.

718
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,170
She's showing everything but her vagina.

719
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,540
I mean her knee is just
strategically blocking her labia.

720
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,820
Her legs are wide open
and she's hot as fuck.

721
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,421
Now here's the thing.

722
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,690
If you put the Kyron right
in front of the vagina,

723
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,250
then everybody would know the news.

724
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,203
Exactly.

725
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,020
We'd be a very informed country and women
would get angry at you if you knew the

726
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:26,450
news.

727
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,650
Oh,

728
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,960
you were looking at her vagina
and you read the fucking news.

729
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,793
Huh?

730
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,550
Like she,

731
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:30,790
like,

732
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,830
it's just weird that they
get to dress like that.

733
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:36,910
Like she's completely wearing come
fuck me pumps back that up again.

734
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:37,121
Let's,

735
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,410
let's dissect this.

736
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,210
Look at her like her shoes.

737
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,111
Those are like,

738
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,910
I want to go out and get sexy shoes.

739
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,820
There's a not comfortable by
any stretch of the imagination.

740
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,410
They show most of your foot.

741
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:47,980
Her,

742
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,040
almost her entire legs are exposed.

743
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,360
Mean you imagine if a guy
was sitting there like that.

744
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,140
You know how bizarre that would be if
there was a show where a guy was sitting

745
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,190
there in a tiny,

746
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,970
tiny kilt and you know that you could,

747
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,710
if he moves his left knee
an inch to the right,

748
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,540
you're going to see his cock for sure.

749
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,390
And,

750
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,890
and they also have like an ejection
button that slings them into the

751
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:09,671
stratosphere at once.

752
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:10,570
They hit 35,

753
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,700
but you hit an age in an age limit.

754
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,620
They disappeared on poor girls.

755
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,640
That's a fixed.

756
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:17,050
You had some kind of
irritation down there.

757
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:17,310
So.

758
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,840
Well I think Sarah Pailin
brought the DM MILF back.

759
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,090
So maybe,

760
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:22,410
uh,

761
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,250
maybe we'll move in that direction,

762
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,050
but I don't think she
actually brought it back.

763
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,010
She brought it back for a little bit.

764
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:27,611
But now people are,

765
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:28,040
like,

766
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,430
you say too much crazy shit.

767
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,363
Guilt,

768
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,820
guilt.

769
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,740
You forgetting the grandma.

770
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,013
She's a qrf.

771
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,450
You don't want to say that though
because it'll fuck with you.

772
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:35,651
Dig.

773
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,484
It's creepy.

774
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,030
Yeah.

775
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,810
Is Okay.

776
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,910
But not so much.

777
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,510
It's just weird that we have these
odd standards of sexual attire in the

778
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:48,550
workplace and not just in the
workplace but on television,

779
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,660
like on television,

780
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:54,661
promoting this strange propaganda machine
and just really hot girls with their

781
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:55,811
vaginas.

782
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:58,330
Hanging out with explosions and hot girls.

783
00:22:58,331 --> 00:22:58,661
Okay.

784
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:02,620
I can't pay attention to whatever the
fuck she say when she see her thighs.

785
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,513
Oh my God.

786
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,150
If I see that girl go,

787
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:05,650
wow,

788
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,550
I wish she liked me.

789
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:08,831
You know?

790
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,710
Especially if you're lonely and you know,

791
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,880
you're not married or anything.

792
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,530
Dude,

793
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,021
that guy.

794
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:16,080
That guy is like 12 times he size.

795
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,331
Yeah.

796
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:17,650
It's rob for its fat brother.

797
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,130
And what other shirts has like
Kimbera man that from the ground up,

798
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:21,890
skirt,

799
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,340
skirt.

800
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,590
It's totally enough score there.

801
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:25,270
Panning from the vagina up.

802
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,640
It's off center just slightly.

803
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,380
He's trying to show off his two though.

804
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,310
You gotta give him credit.

805
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:30,760
Who's.

806
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,001
Well,

807
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:32,170
you know it's got to go to war.

808
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,471
You know,

809
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:33,460
you've got to get a respect.

810
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,720
He doesn't give.

811
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,260
Fuck.

812
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,810
The only way I'm gonna get this one is
if I let her know I don't give a fuck.

813
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,890
Here's my gut.

814
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,500
I'm not trying to cover myself up.

815
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:41,770
I'm staying an extra straight.

816
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,090
I'm spreading my legs wide.

817
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,601
Look at that.

818
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,620
Package is going for the.

819
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,060
Don't give a fuck points.

820
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,540
It might be a fat fuck,

821
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:47,970
but I'll fight.

822
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,500
You should add a fact because
I like to live that good life.

823
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,603
That's what he's saying.

824
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,400
Like there's playlist of
all the different ones.

825
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,990
Was that one the one that you just showed?

826
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,401
That's a Fox.

827
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,270
Went to the redhead.

828
00:23:59,690 --> 00:23:59,871
Yeah,

829
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,351
it's crazy.

830
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:00,681
That one.

831
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:01,371
The blonde.

832
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:02,204
That was screens.

833
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
I know who she is.

834
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:03,830
That's the one.

835
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,750
She's been on these things before.

836
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,680
They're all hot though.

837
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,670
They're beautiful.

838
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,503
It's weird,

839
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,490
but it's just such a dirty trick.

840
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,410
One.

841
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,243
I'm not,

842
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,290
especially like if you're married
and you know when you're trying to be

843
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:18,464
monogamous,

844
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,510
you're going to look at sex in a different
way because you look at like a girl

845
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,141
that's like super,

846
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:25,310
super hot and you go,

847
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,390
oh,

848
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,620
I could never get that.

849
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,540
If you're single,

850
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,800
if you're delusional,

851
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:31,311
you'd be like,

852
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:31,611
man,

853
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:34,160
if I just ran into her at
the right place right time,

854
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,173
maybe this could happen.

855
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,290
So it's a different thing.

856
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,130
So it's the.

857
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,000
There's a wistful,

858
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:38,930
almost romantic way.

859
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:40,550
You look at the Fox News
girls if you're married

860
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,901
on the,

861
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,220
on the on the same note.

862
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:45,430
It's like when I went out when a
hot celebrity like gets divorced,

863
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:47,940
there's something inside
the most loser of guys.

864
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:49,060
It's like now I got a shot.

865
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:49,940
You know,

866
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,280
like,

867
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,180
like Angelina Jolie gets
divorced and people are like,

868
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:52,730
okay.

869
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,990
They think all I gotta do.

870
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,340
I'm just,

871
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,620
their guys are so fucking delusional.

872
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,320
They feel like all they gotta
do is be at the right place,

873
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:00,981
the right time.

874
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:01,161
You know,

875
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:04,910
maybe she goes to the car shop because
your wipers broken and she wants to try

876
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:05,721
to fix it herself.

877
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:06,554
And you know,

878
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,530
I get to impress her by my knowledge of
windshield wipers and she realized I'm

879
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,510
just a regular guy and
sometimes girls will.

880
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,423
Jesus Christ.

881
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,090
Look at this.

882
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,440
She actually pulls her skirt up.

883
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:15,980
Look,

884
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,370
Bam.

885
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:16,610
Like,

886
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,443
oh,

887
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,030
pulling it up.

888
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,970
How dare you,

889
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:20,870
you dirty bitch.

890
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,763
Oh my God,

891
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,270
look how she sits.

892
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,140
It's perfect posture.

893
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,230
It's kind of like going back to
when you were like really young,

894
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:32,080
looking at like jc
penny's lingerie catalogs,

895
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:35,860
like when we're tense and you wonder why
people that Watch Fox News are idiots.

896
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,430
I mean,

897
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,850
not that a lot of networks aren't,

898
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,471
but you know,

899
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:40,390
they did that study that
people have watched Fox News.

900
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:41,570
No less about what's
happening in the world.

901
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,880
The people watching no news at all.

902
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,630
I believe that.

903
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,270
I love that.

904
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,103
That makes sense.

905
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:45,970
It'd be all.

906
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,191
You're gonna,

907
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:46,431
you're gonna.

908
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:48,050
Find out about captain Kirk's love life.

909
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,280
So these are two regular guys.

910
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:51,114
Is ABC,

911
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,520
ABC as regular girls.

912
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,850
ABC is more probably geared towards
women that don't want to be threatened

913
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,690
in the background.

914
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,840
He's never seen this video to be naked.

915
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,490
No,

916
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,270
it's just hammered in the shorts.

917
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,011
Well Christy,

918
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:11,810
they are the whole neighborhood knows
the boy jumped out of a fucking second

919
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,060
story window and fell.

920
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,561
Oh my God.

921
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,394
That's funny.

922
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,900
That's funny.

923
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,081
Yeah.

924
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:19,820
If you leave the fucking
camera on long enough,

925
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,500
people catch the craziest shit ever.

926
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,670
Did you see any of the,

927
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,410
like the snow storm driving
footage son you got jacked?

928
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,203
Yes.

929
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,500
Yeah.

930
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,610
Snow storms all throughout the country
that been getting these nutty snow and

931
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:35,444
ice storms.

932
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,340
Yeah.

933
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,173
What is that man?

934
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,570
It's,

935
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,300
it should be.

936
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,280
It's unfair.

937
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,521
I mean,

938
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,620
I don't want to say that pretty
girls shouldn't be able to get a job.

939
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,723
They should,

940
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,490
but it shouldn't be exclusively pretty
girls telling you about important shit

941
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,900
week to week.

942
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,400
We're not paying attention to the message.

943
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,640
No,

944
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,473
not at all.

945
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,321
But that's the thing.

946
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,970
If you see an ugly girl on the news,

947
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:54,560
you're like,

948
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
that girl knows her shit.

949
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,241
Right?

950
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,780
She fought her way to the top.

951
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,420
There's just something about,

952
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,320
um,

953
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,561
like,

954
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:00,770
uh,

955
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,031
like,

956
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:01,500
like I said,

957
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,760
like those Fox News women that like the
one you were talking about before the

958
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:08,510
show started who argued with someone
about Santa Claus being white.

959
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,530
Meghan Kelly.

960
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:13,220
Apparently said very authoritatively
that Santa Claus is white.

961
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,840
Yeah,

962
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,980
she's very authoritative.

963
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:15,814
Always.

964
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,200
A lot of those gals are.

965
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,780
But there's something like four Beta men,

966
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,930
especially for men that are
weak and beaten down by life.

967
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,410
The ultimate fantasy is
that this woman accepts you.

968
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,500
The ultimate fantasy is that
she's impressed by you and
accept you because she's

969
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:30,370
so hard ass.

970
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,900
She's so obviously beautiful,

971
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,150
but also so hard ass that there's this,

972
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,231
there's this,

973
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:35,770
uh,

974
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,131
you know,

975
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:36,880
when she's around you,

976
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,860
you want to like mark obamacare.

977
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,740
You want to just start
making fun of it like you.

978
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,910
He'll write specific
just to make her happy.

979
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,780
Girls.

980
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,081
Yeah.

981
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:44,870
Just get in,

982
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,320
get in to get in and just talk to her.

983
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,740
He asked white had.

984
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,613
Goddamn righty.

985
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,853
Yes.

986
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,380
Show me one picture with Santa.

987
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:52,860
It's black.

988
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,280
It wasn't drawn by a black guy.

989
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,040
So yeah,

990
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,410
we were saying the sand is
probably Siberian prolix.

991
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,253
Chinese

992
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,920
Greenpeace just put out a video of Santa,

993
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,180
like in a melting height.

994
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,230
And the point is that,

995
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,470
and he's saying how the
Arctic is melting or whatever.

996
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,150
And it's pretty creepy video.

997
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,111
Well,

998
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:11,920
it is know,

999
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,470
but it's also so hard.

1000
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:15,041
Let's face it,

1001
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,360
he's gonna fall through
the ice before the.

1002
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,040
A little extra weight.

1003
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,410
It's so fought hard,

1004
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,970
fought hard to fucking figure out when
when it comes to climate and climate

1005
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,893
change,

1006
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,820
it's hard to figure out why people have
this weird need to be on a team one side

1007
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,880
of the other and now they
have this weird name.

1008
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,013
I was in an

1009
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,240
exercise class and someone
brought up just out of nowhere,

1010
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,500
some guy brought up climate
change and this young guy who's,

1011
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,700
you know,

1012
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,120
could have been 1:25 years old,

1013
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,253
starts going.

1014
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,870
Climate change as always happened.

1015
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,280
It's a part of life.

1016
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:52,380
It's a part of the cycle of earth.

1017
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,030
It's always gotten warm
and always gotten cooler.

1018
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:54,540
Yeah.

1019
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,800
Over a million years.

1020
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,220
Never.

1021
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,970
Sure.

1022
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,220
Every other time it's
happened over a million years.

1023
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:00,150
Now it's 100,

1024
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,673
but it's also like,

1025
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,270
how much research have you done?

1026
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,400
He was there,

1027
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,000
he was there,

1028
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,380
he wasn't what he was saying.

1029
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,420
What he was doing is just like going
against liberal ideology right away.

1030
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm on team B team

1031
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,583
business,

1032
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:14,921
you know,

1033
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:15,340
I'm a.

1034
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,990
I'm a no nonsense business sort of a
guy and it's just this need to be taken

1035
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,280
seriously and so,

1036
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:21,491
you know,

1037
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:22,530
he and I had this conversation.

1038
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:22,781
I said,

1039
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:23,430
well,

1040
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,240
it's absolutely changed
throughout history.

1041
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,200
It's without a doubt,

1042
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,260
but it's also very possible
and most likely that we're
changing it right now and

1043
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:31,510
even more rapidly than normal.

1044
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,680
Something to be concerned with.

1045
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,320
And like he had this look on
his face like he can't have.

1046
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,880
I was giving them both options.

1047
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,730
I was given them the option to
write and I was also saying,

1048
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,191
you know,

1049
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:40,620
the climate,

1050
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,520
a control site and you're
giving it in an easy way.

1051
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,890
Like this seems like we don't
have to argue what do I.

1052
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:45,720
don't give a fuck.

1053
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,440
I have no invested interest or no,

1054
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,020
no vested interest in being
right about climate change.

1055
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,160
I've done zero work in it.

1056
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,080
If it was my chosen field,

1057
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,350
then maybe perhaps my ego would be
attached to climate change like Egypt.

1058
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,011
But yeah,

1059
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,890
he just snowed in Egypt for the first
time at 100 and something years the other

1060
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:00,250
day.

1061
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:00,670
Snowden.

1062
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,500
Cairo,

1063
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,801
yeah.

1064
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,540
I was in Illinois a month ago.

1065
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,890
When they had the most tornadoes they've
ever had in November or whatever it

1066
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:07,500
was,

1067
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,000
sitting under a bridge or one of those

1068
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,610
going to Chicago in January.

1069
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,200
It'll be.

1070
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,033
That'll be fine.

1071
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,920
Brian.

1072
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,610
I got to get you to put
that on the calendar.

1073
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:16,970
Okay.

1074
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,290
That's the Chicago theater.

1075
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:23,291
January 24th with a beautiful and talented
Ari Shaffir who goes cold as fuck.

1076
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:24,971
Fuck,

1077
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:25,211
fuck,

1078
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:25,460
fuck.

1079
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,293
Fuck.

1080
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,090
I heard rfcs moving back.

1081
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,210
Oh,

1082
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,070
you have to do is just moved to New York.

1083
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,480
Yeah.

1084
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,930
You get one winter there and you're like,

1085
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,141
oh,

1086
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,940
this is a place where I can go
where I don't have to do this.

1087
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,040
That was on a couple shows with them,

1088
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,030
but I thought he was just visiting.

1089
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,411
Yeah,

1090
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,280
he stayed there for awhile.

1091
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,540
I think it helps comedy a lot.

1092
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:42,900
He just decided that we needed a new
environment needed to really mix it up.

1093
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,790
So we got an apartment there.

1094
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,713
80 five right now?

1095
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,650
Yeah.

1096
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,483
In La,

1097
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,600
you know,

1098
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,010
New York's fucking fantastic.

1099
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,173
It's huge.

1100
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,230
It's gigantic.

1101
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:56,370
It's filled with all sorts of interesting
stuff and it's more museums per capita

1102
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,340
than any city in the country and it's a.

1103
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,840
it's a thought hub for sure,

1104
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,840
but it's also like you're
also beat your brains out,

1105
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:05,820
but being surrounded by
people like that all the time,

1106
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,993
just

1107
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,690
don't necessarily think
that's good for you.

1108
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,530
Yeah,

1109
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,190
I like it.

1110
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,490
Yeah.

1111
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,240
Some people love it.

1112
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,140
My manager loves it.

1113
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,770
He fucking,

1114
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,030
he wouldn't live anywhere else.

1115
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,480
It keeps.

1116
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,313
Keeps me angry.

1117
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:16,871
Yeah.

1118
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:17,071
He goes,

1119
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:18,150
I love the energy of the city.

1120
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,993
I'm like,

1121
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:19,710
I just,

1122
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,820
I want to be similar way here.

1123
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:25,380
Like birds Chirp and I just see the
wind blows gently through the trees.

1124
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,610
I don't hear anybody talking.

1125
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,833
That's what I need,

1126
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,370
but I think there's just because of
around such large numbers of people,

1127
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,230
I want to have a balance of that.

1128
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:35,810
Like with the UFC or the,

1129
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,230
you know,

1130
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,063
doing comedy shows.

1131
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,280
Yeah.

1132
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,130
Get all these people.

1133
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,980
I want to balance that out with just some.

1134
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:41,850
No people time

1135
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,230
you,

1136
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,461
your,

1137
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:45,260
your job is to watch people beat each
other's heads and you don't need it on the

1138
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,000
subway and the sidewalk.

1139
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,230
Enjoy watching violence outside of my job.

1140
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,470
Yeah.

1141
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:51,911
Well there's not.

1142
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,340
I don't think it's any more violence
in New York and there was no la now.

1143
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:55,450
I just meant angry people.

1144
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,980
I think in fact,

1145
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,280
probably New York is more open minded,

1146
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:00,971
you know,

1147
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,400
a lot of people don't think that they
think of California as being the most open

1148
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:04,090
minded,

1149
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,350
but I think quite honestly that there's
something that you miss when you were in

1150
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,160
cars all the time.

1151
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,120
You don't interact with people.

1152
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,481
That's.

1153
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:11,060
I think that's.

1154
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,841
It's actually what it is.

1155
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:12,710
I think that it,

1156
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:13,940
unless you're truly rich,

1157
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:16,490
rich in New York City and
taking a cab everywhere you are,

1158
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:16,990
you're,

1159
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,310
you're interacting with every
type of person all day long

1160
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,490
and even if you are rich
that you have to take a cab,

1161
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,290
like maybe for that one brief moment,

1162
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,060
you know you're in a
different environment,

1163
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:26,380
but you'd get out of the cab,

1164
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:29,110
you're going to walk right and you're
gonna walk for a block or two and it's

1165
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,210
going to be a fucking billion people.

1166
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,430
There's experiences like that
where you're walking down New York,

1167
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,990
you don't get that anywhere else.

1168
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,500
It's not parking lot of the
office to the house garage.

1169
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,620
It's not like mall,

1170
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,360
he didn't park your car in the mall,

1171
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:44,070
you walk in holding hands like
the other Dr Seuss families,

1172
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,460
this fucking hordes of people walking
up and down and it's weird people and

1173
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,320
homeless people and you gotta
step over bumps and you know,

1174
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:53,360
you got to see everything.

1175
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,490
You got to see the whole
fucking broad spectrum.

1176
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,420
Set it again.

1177
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:56,661
Yeah,

1178
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:58,430
I mean I think la is very,

1179
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,470
very kind of liberal or left wing,

1180
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:03,800
but there's a lot of apathy because
I feel like it's just too nice here.

1181
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,200
It's just too nice and happy
is definitely not enough.

1182
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,970
Whether were cocky as fuck.

1183
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,350
There's no seasons.

1184
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:09,621
Yeah.

1185
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,580
They don't have to deal with weather.

1186
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,473
Whether it's real,

1187
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:11,940
you know,

1188
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,860
you need to know that you're on
a planet to change all the time.

1189
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:16,880
We didn't in the cold smacks in the face.

1190
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,091
Yeah.

1191
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:17,690
We have like,

1192
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,270
we found like an area of the
game where we got to God code.

1193
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,023
Come over here.

1194
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,871
Oh God,

1195
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,381
code over here.

1196
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,100
It doesn't rain.

1197
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,401
It doesn't.

1198
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,810
Snow never gets cold.

1199
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,280
The worst of the wears a Hoodie,

1200
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,470
like that's the worst you
have to wear here as a Hoodie.

1201
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,630
He just hit abb,

1202
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,031
left,

1203
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:32,181
right,

1204
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:32,361
left,

1205
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:33,194
right.

1206
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,160
Nice weather forever.

1207
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,490
It would do everybody a lot of good
if it snowed here every year would

1208
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,660
straightened a lot of fucking
fucking crazy ice storm.

1209
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:42,770
Tornado just once a year.

1210
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,260
Just snowed

1211
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,840
and God fucking cold and brained
and just let you know that like,

1212
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:48,350
look,

1213
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:48,630
okay,

1214
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,760
you ain't shit bitch.

1215
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,350
I think there's a reason why people
that live on the actual coast itself,

1216
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:54,710
um,

1217
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,580
have a more humble and more
laid back sort of vibe to them.

1218
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,720
Like beach towns.

1219
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,570
Like if you go to Huntington
or Venice or Santa Monica,

1220
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:04,790
you have like a more
laid back sort of a vibe.

1221
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,900
And I think part of that,

1222
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,660
it's like you're faced with
the reality of the ocean,

1223
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,410
right?

1224
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,243
Like you ain't shit

1225
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,150
how massive this is.

1226
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,020
You standing there next to this insane
thing that you can't even go in.

1227
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,460
And if it comes over you,

1228
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,473
you're fucked.

1229
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,300
And it does it every now and then you
just playing Russian roulette that it

1230
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:21,140
doesn't do it today.

1231
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,820
One day though,

1232
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,690
the earth moves

1233
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,820
middle somewhere and a fucking seven
mile high wall of water just watches a

1234
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,610
hundred miles in all the way to
fucking receipt a kills everybody.

1235
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:31,821
Yeah,

1236
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:32,450
that happened

1237
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,283
all the time.

1238
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,831
Everyone's well,

1239
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:35,510
it's nice to see the earth fight back.

1240
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:36,171
Just be like,

1241
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:36,500
look,

1242
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm still in control.

1243
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:37,921
Well,

1244
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:38,760
just to let you know,

1245
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:39,530
like this is a,

1246
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,180
you haven't locked this thing down at all.

1247
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,800
You have zero control over the weather.

1248
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,630
He have zero control of asteroids.

1249
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:46,830
He has zero control,

1250
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:48,420
super volcanoes and all the other shit.

1251
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,000
Like a micro organisms could
kill us anytime they want it.

1252
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,333
We can't be scanned.

1253
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,260
So I meant sorry,

1254
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,660
I meant um,

1255
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,960
was there any negative
repercussions when you did that?

1256
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:58,794
Fox News thing?

1257
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,061
Uh,

1258
00:34:59,061 --> 00:34:59,361
yeah,

1259
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:00,800
and wiped out my entire career,

1260
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,203
uh,

1261
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,980
kind of switched.

1262
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:06,290
I mean it was okay because I was kind
of looking to make the switch anyway,

1263
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:10,400
but it switched me from a
completely college touring
comedian that was basically

1264
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,670
all my income was college touring
and I had a largely apolitical,

1265
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,930
largely clean,

1266
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:15,860
but not exactly clean,

1267
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:17,480
but a act.

1268
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,560
And I was kind of switching more to
politics and Karen more about that shit.

1269
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,240
And after this clip went viral,

1270
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,760
it was the first thing every
activities board looks up on Google.

1271
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:26,620
And uh,

1272
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,200
I've,

1273
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,580
I did 500 colleges.

1274
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,410
I've probably done 10
in the past four years.

1275
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,321
Wow.

1276
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:32,550
That's hilarious.

1277
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
And for folks who don't know,

1278
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:34,830
college has pay a lot of money.

1279
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:36,600
Like a lot of guys when
they're first coming up,

1280
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,950
like that's number one goal.

1281
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:38,040
The

1282
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,140
first goal is to get a college agent,

1283
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,190
get an Naca,

1284
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,480
do good at the convention.

1285
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,830
And then started doing college tours.

1286
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,190
That was a ton of money like you could do.

1287
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,411
Yeah.

1288
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,580
Well you're a nobody.

1289
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,530
You can make two grand
a show in the nineties.

1290
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,903
Yup.

1291
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,181
Yeah.

1292
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,500
I knew I was a nobody,

1293
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:52,990
you know,

1294
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,700
like not even.

1295
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:53,881
Yeah.

1296
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:54,511
I guess the nineties,

1297
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:55,860
early nineties it was,

1298
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,080
it was still like the early two thousands.

1299
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,800
It's a good,

1300
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,850
it's a really good place.

1301
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,890
Some guys get in a rut unfortunately.

1302
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:03,600
And they become just college comics.

1303
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,021
Right.

1304
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:06,540
Which is why I was looking to
change because you get stuck there,

1305
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,320
don't you?

1306
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,021
Totally do.

1307
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:08,880
And people don't realize it,

1308
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:10,380
but when you go to Naca,

1309
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,470
like they offer you
the chance to showcase,

1310
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:18,471
but they would really like you to
be like as as clean as possible.

1311
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,750
They don't want you doing any
Bradley really controversial Shit.

1312
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,840
They want you to be able
to like they a put you on.

1313
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,010
They don't want to worry about getting
any people that are offended that we're

1314
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,900
gonna write letters,

1315
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,793
emails,

1316
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,281
people.

1317
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:31,650
People still have this
impression of colleges from like,

1318
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:32,070
I don't know,

1319
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,590
the seventies and eighties
where they likely,

1320
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,211
oh yeah,

1321
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:37,480
there are these activist
hubs and everything now
cause kids don't give a fuck.

1322
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,400
Just a lot of Virginia

1323
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:38,851
in college,

1324
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:39,690
which is really weird.

1325
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,480
Joey Diaz and I did the
University of Miami,

1326
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:45,690
I think it was going to assume at some
university in my final couple of years

1327
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:50,691
back and we were in the
middle of something and I
remember I said I saw so many

1328
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:53,220
people that didn't know what
the fuck I was talking about.

1329
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:53,431
I go,

1330
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:54,810
how many people here are virgins?

1331
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:55,861
I go,

1332
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:56,700
you don't have to raise your hand.

1333
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,910
I could just give me a little of this.

1334
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,470
Just lift your hand yet.

1335
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,573
There was a lot.

1336
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,340
A lot.

1337
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,240
It was and I was like,

1338
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:04,590
you guys don't even know
what I'm talking about.

1339
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,191
Like,

1340
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:05,581
oh my God,

1341
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:06,330
you're in college.

1342
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,320
You guys have to fuck.

1343
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:07,910
Yeah.

1344
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,730
Get it over with.

1345
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,130
This is a big part of life and
you haven't even started it yet.

1346
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,591
That was your game.

1347
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:13,424
Probably though.

1348
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,360
You're at Miami,

1349
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,171
University of Miami.

1350
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:15,981
You guys need to fuck.

1351
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:16,820
So we're having a party.

1352
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,560
Yeah,

1353
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,710
but even if they know what you mean
when you say a joke about fucking they

1354
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:25,580
probably a little sad.

1355
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:26,210
They're not doing it,

1356
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,400
so they get so mad at so
many different things.

1357
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,720
People are looking forward to

1358
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,080
protesting in a lot of ways in colleges.

1359
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:35,590
They're trying to stretch out
their protest muscles and you know,

1360
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,660
sometimes misguided,

1361
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,540
sometimes guided.

1362
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:42,490
It's a lot of it is done
in the correct mindset.

1363
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,850
Whether or not it's the correct
idea to protests in the first place,

1364
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:50,020
but you could have a joke about anything
that someone finds misogynistic and

1365
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:50,471
next thing you know,

1366
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:52,340
there's a giant letter
that's written about you,

1367
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,050
you know,

1368
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,200
from one of the people that attended your
college show and then you have to deal

1369
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:56,610
with that.

1370
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:56,941
Yeah,

1371
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,700
I actually went to one where
they told me beforehand they go,

1372
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:00,001
okay,

1373
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:01,500
so don't curse and uh,

1374
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:01,810
don't,

1375
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,610
don't.

1376
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,271
This is the best.

1377
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:04,860
Don't mention drugs or alcohol.

1378
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,000
And it was like,

1379
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,650
what order a clown then.

1380
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,011
All right,

1381
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,690
you don't want a comedian if you're like,

1382
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,760
act like half of life doesn't exist.

1383
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,750
I remember someone said there's a,

1384
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,510
like a stock joke to
Jews walking to a bar.

1385
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,900
They buy it silly,

1386
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,320
right?

1387
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,840
Right.

1388
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,960
Someone said it and this
guy comes up and says,

1389
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,000
I was very offended by that Jewish joke.

1390
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:25,781
I go,

1391
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,160
that's the most ridiculous shit ever.

1392
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,310
Listen to what he said to Jews
walk into a bar and they buy it.

1393
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:32,530
That means they purchased these.

1394
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,180
They have a lot of money and
they purchased businesses.

1395
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:34,580
Like,

1396
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:34,780
what?

1397
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,890
What's about that?

1398
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,211
How could you be offended?

1399
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,310
But I like that they're
looking to be offended.

1400
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:41,170
People are looking to be,

1401
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,400
to just hear they're buzzword.

1402
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,800
That is totally a buzzword
because that joke is,

1403
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,000
it's not about cheap.

1404
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,910
It's about guys who purchased a bar.

1405
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,890
It's so stupid.

1406
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:51,310
It's like,

1407
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,143
what are you saying?

1408
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,390
It's bad to be a bad ass businessman.

1409
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,110
I'm so confused why you're upset.

1410
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,170
But it's still,

1411
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,200
they're not really upset there.

1412
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:00,260
So looking at me upset and there's,

1413
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,730
there's a difference between someone
who's actually like protesting something

1414
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:07,810
that's real and someone will get
upset at nonsense and it's fucking.

1415
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,190
It's really frustrating.

1416
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,143
Like there's a um,

1417
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:10,511
there's,

1418
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:11,610
something's going on today.

1419
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,180
There's a female protest her.

1420
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Did you see this thing?

1421
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,273
And she's a,

1422
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,400
she got arrested for sexual assault
because she kissed or a riot policeman's

1423
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:23,140
helmet and there's a
picture of her doing it.

1424
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,070
It's,

1425
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,540
it's really weird,

1426
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:25,721
man.

1427
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:26,740
And it's in Italy,

1428
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,820
my people,

1429
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,170
you fucking dummies.

1430
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,100
How dare you,

1431
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,510
how dare this girl is beautiful.

1432
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,260
And she's pretty and she's kissing this
helmet and they arrested her for sexual

1433
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:35,560
assault.

1434
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,670
Like that's not,

1435
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,440
that's not the correct use of power.

1436
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,130
That's abusive

1437
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,060
power in the UK,

1438
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:43,450
they were prosecuting a protest
because he called a police horse.

1439
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:44,080
Gay.

1440
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,910
Look at that gorgeous girl,

1441
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,330
so pretty and she's got glasses.

1442
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,990
Sexual assault were Mexican.

1443
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,670
I think he's well defended
against the sexual assault.

1444
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,553
Vimeo.

1445
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,050
Oh,

1446
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,620
come on.

1447
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,370
I feel like he's well
protected against girls.

1448
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,223
So privileged.

1449
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,520
That's so crazy.

1450
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,290
That's just.

1451
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:58,960
Look at him.

1452
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,800
He probably fucked her.

1453
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,820
He's essentially got a
face condom on right now.

1454
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,580
Has a finger in her.

1455
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,473
They got together,

1456
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,850
did some odd couple sex

1457
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,900
is so weird.

1458
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,390
The things that people try to get
away with like something like that,

1459
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:13,740
like how could you try
to get away with that,

1460
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,410
how you don't know that
that's a bad thing to do this,

1461
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,280
this,

1462
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,850
this.

1463
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,930
Making someone go to court in
arresting them for sexual assault,

1464
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,120
for kissing a fucking woman who's
gently kissing a policeman's outfit.

1465
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,443
Children here.

1466
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,000
This dude went into chase.

1467
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,781
Reverend Billy,

1468
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:32,540
well known prior to protest rate was
facing a year in jail cause he went into

1469
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:36,470
chase bank with some people and they sang
about the death of the rain forest or

1470
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:38,090
something and they called it riot.

1471
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:40,580
Causing a riot or they should
go to jail for being dumb,

1472
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,330
but riots for a singing is a riot.

1473
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,500
You can't save the rain forest at the
fucking bank by singing so misguided.

1474
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,391
Seriously.

1475
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:52,790
That's like trying to win a game
of pool when you're at home in bed.

1476
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,730
To be fair in this picture that we don't
know if this lasted for 30 minutes.

1477
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:57,800
Her trying to grope them and
like tried to grab his dick.

1478
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,653
You know what I mean?

1479
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,110
She says kissed.

1480
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,460
If she did all that other stuff,

1481
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:01,740
they would.

1482
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,690
They would drag it out.

1483
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,000
It would.

1484
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,040
They would add that as well.

1485
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,150
All she did kiss him.

1486
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,020
She kissed him.

1487
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,400
I mean his pants were off during that,

1488
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:10,020
but people are so fucking silly like that.

1489
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,371
Look,

1490
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:11,300
you know what happened there?

1491
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,223
No one got hurt.

1492
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,690
Like the idea that you would do that,

1493
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,140
try to take someone through the
legal system for something so silly.

1494
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:21,470
That makes me angry that you have any
power because you're a petty piece of

1495
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:22,190
shit.

1496
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,401
You know,

1497
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:23,960
to do that to someone to just kiss you.

1498
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,441
Come on,

1499
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,550
you're a pending piece of shit.

1500
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,211
That's cute.

1501
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:28,550
You don't think it's cute that a
beautiful woman kiss your fucking shield

1502
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,110
Shinara you do stop.

1503
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,970
It's like when that Uc Davis,

1504
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,980
UC Davis got pepper

1505
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,251
sprayed,

1506
00:41:34,251 --> 00:41:37,160
all those kids and the world
just went fucking bananas.

1507
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:37,840
You know,

1508
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,511
it's the same thing.

1509
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:38,900
Like,

1510
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,441
you know,

1511
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:40,274
that's not right.

1512
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,881
You know,

1513
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:42,210
you can't just walk up to children.

1514
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,113
Did you see?

1515
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,181
Maybe you can look it up,

1516
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:47,540
but he sued and got
something like $30,000.

1517
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,310
Yeah.

1518
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:48,740
For,

1519
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,210
for getting fired or whatever.

1520
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:50,840
After doing that.

1521
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,960
Well from the Internet response
for a posttraumatic stress.

1522
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,260
Oh yeah.

1523
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,190
He said it depressed him.

1524
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,143
Of course it did.

1525
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,540
Jesus,

1526
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,750
how much he did that get
deserved all deserved.

1527
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:05,921
What?

1528
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:07,910
This Guy Franco met my car,

1529
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,200
I guess as he says,

1530
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:12,380
he's not prepared to brush off the
incident as a peaceful gesture.

1531
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,600
God put an idiot.

1532
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,600
The Italian police is broken.

1533
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,800
Baroque was down at,

1534
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:20,510
uh,

1535
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,530
occupy La.

1536
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:22,700
I went down there for one day,

1537
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,710
like what did it smell like?

1538
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,540
What did it smell like?

1539
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:24,740
Yeah,

1540
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,573
it's not fun.

1541
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,901
It was like a year ago,

1542
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:27,410
but it wasn't.

1543
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:27,891
They weren't,

1544
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:28,311
it wasn't.

1545
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:31,220
The occupation was part of
the art walk or whatever,

1546
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,480
and they were getting writers.

1547
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:32,901
I showed up.

1548
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:36,120
They were getting shot with rubber
bullets for writing and chalk on the

1549
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,870
sidewalks and these kids had.

1550
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:42,470
Some of these kids have these big
bloody welds from where do those rubber

1551
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:45,630
bullets can fuck you up and take on
an eye too if they hit you in the eye.

1552
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,030
I know a girl last night.

1553
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,230
Oh my God.

1554
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,040
It's so crazy from a fucking what I
got shot with one of the long time ago.

1555
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,150
You get shot with rubber bullets.

1556
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,300
Yeah.

1557
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,010
They in Ohio state campus.

1558
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,390
Every time they played Michigan,

1559
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,860
like shit just went crazy.

1560
00:42:57,861 --> 00:42:59,270
I people would catch cars on fire.

1561
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,830
They would bomb the whole entire campus
with a lot with tear gas and stuff.

1562
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,240
So even if you're in your house,

1563
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,810
you would still have tear gas
in your house and say that.

1564
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,110
You mean the students would do that?

1565
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,180
The cubs,

1566
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,170
the campus police to break up the protest.

1567
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:15,591
Well,

1568
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:16,340
it wasn't.

1569
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,820
It was just nonstop partying.

1570
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:21,280
Like every street had houses on
our cars on fire and party in here.

1571
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,123
Some tear gas.

1572
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:22,320
Yeah,

1573
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,090
so they used to,

1574
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,870
they used to just shoot the rubber bullets
to get us off the streets and I was

1575
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,960
just walking from a bar to my house
trying to get back to my house.

1576
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:30,201
They're like,

1577
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:30,711
get in your house.

1578
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:31,070
I'm like,

1579
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,790
I'm trying to walk and they just start
firing at as it hit me in the leg and my

1580
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:37,280
whole leg just bubbled up
and got black and it hurt.

1581
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,040
Like fuck.

1582
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,660
Yeah,

1583
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,680
that's some rude shit.

1584
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,600
I mean those fucking things.

1585
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:43,700
It's not like like a nerf bullet,

1586
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,340
the rubber and they're
going like bullet speeds,

1587
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,180
you know?

1588
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:52,010
I think that's pretty fucking
trains train guys used to shoot us,

1589
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,100
try to shoot us to like,

1590
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,200
like on train tracks.

1591
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,820
We would always like put
like nickels and quarters,

1592
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,340
like on the train tracks and stuff and
they would see us near and they'll just

1593
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:01,370
start firing these guns and then
they wouldn't really aim it at it.

1594
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,390
They were just trying to scare us.

1595
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,490
They were rubber bullet guns,

1596
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,420
but they were just like firing in
the air and they're fucking Ohio,

1597
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:10,790
a bunch of savages and they might
as well be in the dark ages.

1598
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:17,090
That's a weird thing that people are
doing this bullet bullet look that's next

1599
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:18,740
to that kid.

1600
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,120
That dude got jacked.

1601
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,060
It is really weird.

1602
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:23,960
They're allowed to do that.

1603
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:24,291
I mean,

1604
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,124
come on.

1605
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,000
Especially when it's really drives me
crazy is when they look at the size of

1606
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:29,390
that,

1607
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:34,140
the proof that they've used
agent provocateur is to
break up protests where they

1608
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,560
hire cops to put masks on
and start breaking shit.

1609
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,350
Tons of them and then they go to
the protest is a breaking shit.

1610
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,420
We have to hire cops and
arrest everybody and suddenly

1611
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,141
they move in.

1612
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:49,060
They turn a non peaceful protest into a
or a peaceful protest and do a violence.

1613
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,620
I mean that's the thing that most of these
occupied like half of the people that

1614
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:51,970
know,

1615
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,380
like a quarter of the people were cops.

1616
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,270
That's the inside joke,

1617
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:55,451
right?

1618
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:57,820
It got to the point where people were
saying that there's like 30 something

1619
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:02,440
percent like literally of all
occupy people wonder if that guy,

1620
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:07,030
the CIA guy was there to fake it was his
job in climate experts trying to save

1621
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:07,421
the world.

1622
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:09,190
He's also trying to get some hippie pussy.

1623
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:10,024
Yet

1624
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,740
you tried to go to the

1625
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,730
COUPA.

1626
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,710
What is the current status of occupied
because it seemed like it was real

1627
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:17,720
exciting for awhile,

1628
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,410
but now it just seems like it's
been infiltrated like the mob

1629
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,300
and brought to its knees.

1630
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:23,780
I mean,

1631
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,613
I think that,

1632
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,980
I don't know whether the
brand occupy will continue,

1633
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:30,920
but the activists that were
kind of activated by occupy,

1634
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:32,470
I think they're all still out
there and then I'll do it.

1635
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:33,021
A lot of things.

1636
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,100
A lot of it's online,

1637
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,290
down.

1638
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,150
I don't.

1639
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,190
I'm not trying to demean their efforts,

1640
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:41,550
but what I'm saying is that at one point
in time there was this sense when all

1641
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:45,610
these people were lining up around these
businesses and they're camping out in

1642
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:45,740
the,

1643
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,890
in these parks.

1644
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,130
There was a sense that like the way I
described it was like it was almost like

1645
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:55,110
some white blood cell cells had
gathered around some sort of an injury,

1646
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,170
like some white blood cells figured out
there's something wrong with this area

1647
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:01,050
and we're just going to surround it
until we figured it out and that's what

1648
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:01,801
these people are dealing with.

1649
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:06,801
Standing there and having all their
speeches and the parks and protesting and.

1650
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,130
But then it became like
a thing to do as well.

1651
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,030
It became like,

1652
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:12,780
you know,

1653
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,510
it developed like sort of like
a social thing of its own.

1654
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:16,231
It became,

1655
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,064
when you show him Brian,

1656
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,300
this is like some of the
Shit I was telling you,

1657
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,030
oh look at Ohio state stuff.

1658
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,570
The occupy thing became
like I was listening to this
interview with this kid who

1659
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:27,684
is a,

1660
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,180
he was in college and didn't know what
he's going to do with his life and he

1661
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:31,040
decided to drop out,

1662
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,430
become a part of the occupy movement.

1663
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:35,220
And like then once I saw that it became
clear what I should do with my life.

1664
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,091
And I'm like,

1665
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:36,630
wow,

1666
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,463
okay.

1667
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,460
I don't know about that.

1668
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,830
A lot of people rocky were activated by
it and kind of realized what was going

1669
00:46:44,831 --> 00:46:48,880
on with our society and I think
that's incredibly important.

1670
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:49,360
I mean,

1671
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,193
you also have to,

1672
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,150
you know,

1673
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:51,521
yes,

1674
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:53,590
there are a million failings and
we could go through them all,

1675
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:58,510
but you have to think this is the first
ever spontaneous global protest movement

1676
00:46:58,511 --> 00:46:59,650
in mankind's history.

1677
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,260
That's an achievement in and of
itself and it also changed the entire

1678
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:06,250
conversation in the country from
austerity to the fact that hey,

1679
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,660
these like couple of thousand people
have an incredible amount of wealth.

1680
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:11,543
Yeah.

1681
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,290
What I was going to say is that it was
sort of one of those things when you've

1682
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,700
seen all these people protest,

1683
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:17,810
were you,

1684
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,960
you were realizing that this,

1685
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,820
this model of like no leader thing,

1686
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,933
it doesn't really work.

1687
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,290
Yeah.

1688
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:24,471
No.

1689
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:25,610
It needs to be something in between.

1690
00:47:25,611 --> 00:47:26,211
I believe that yeah.

1691
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:26,780
It's like this.

1692
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,100
It's sort of like got infiltrated and
then sort of scattered and it lost its

1693
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,400
message in a lot of people's eyes
and then it stopped being relevant.

1694
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,290
A lot of people,

1695
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,440
when they talk about the news,

1696
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,930
you don't really hear about occupy
protests very often anymore.

1697
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,740
It was a big thing for quite a while.

1698
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,770
We'd hear about it on a regular basis,

1699
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:42,780
but I think I,

1700
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,920
I hate the idea of leaders,

1701
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,780
but I think there's something to at
least like a governing body that keeps

1702
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:50,710
everything together.

1703
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,430
Yeah.

1704
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,010
Yeah.

1705
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,140
There needs to be some leaders that I
think there needs to be some democracy

1706
00:47:55,141 --> 00:47:55,411
stuff,

1707
00:47:55,411 --> 00:47:56,131
some form.

1708
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:56,850
Um,

1709
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,170
but it was interesting to see.

1710
00:47:58,171 --> 00:47:58,411
I mean,

1711
00:47:58,411 --> 00:47:59,160
a lot of their,

1712
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,050
a lot of the collapse of it
besides the pepper spray and the,

1713
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,890
and the shooting with rubber bullets
and all that stuff that was done.

1714
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,561
Uh,

1715
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:05,800
you know,

1716
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,900
it was because the media all Kinda came
together and said we are all going to

1717
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:10,321
trash it.

1718
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:13,770
I mean the New York Times first
article on it like online or whatever,

1719
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:18,210
a few days in or maybe a weekend was
just saying how stupid it was and how,

1720
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,430
oh,

1721
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,450
the mascot of the movement is
this topless girl who's dancing.

1722
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:22,980
And it was like ridiculous.

1723
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:23,761
I was down there.

1724
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:24,920
I knew exactly what they
were talking about it,

1725
00:48:24,921 --> 00:48:25,770
it was ridiculous.

1726
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,731
And uh,

1727
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:28,170
and so that's the left wing,

1728
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:28,861
New York Times.

1729
00:48:28,861 --> 00:48:29,101
I mean,

1730
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:29,550
that's,

1731
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,290
that's our media,

1732
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:30,651
the number.

1733
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:32,570
When Giuliani was doing that speech,

1734
00:48:32,571 --> 00:48:32,841
he said,

1735
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:35,030
why don't you go occupy a job?

1736
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,173
Eh,

1737
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,073
Eh,

1738
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:43,120
a bad opening act and Jersey maybe because
a lot of these people were occupying

1739
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:47,380
a job for like $7 an hour and couldn't
afford the bus home from the job.

1740
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:47,641
Yeah.

1741
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:48,421
You want to talk about it?

1742
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:49,530
Dude is out of the loop.

1743
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,880
Are you really saying that man?

1744
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:51,540
Yeah.

1745
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,380
This billionaire.

1746
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,220
Why don't you?

1747
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:53,431
Yeah.

1748
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:53,731
Where are you?

1749
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:55,470
The mayor of fucking New York City.

1750
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,370
Like hello?

1751
00:48:56,371 --> 00:48:58,260
You don't know that it's a mess out there.

1752
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:58,830
Yeah.

1753
00:48:58,830 --> 00:48:59,750
Occupy a job.

1754
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,340
Did you really fucking silly bitch.

1755
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,270
It just seems that it's,

1756
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,920
it's the sign of the Times that I'm
enough people like get together and go.

1757
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:11,581
Yeah.

1758
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,001
Yeah.

1759
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:15,210
Like if there's enough agreement
that you can have this gigantic,

1760
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,700
huge movement without a leader.

1761
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,700
But I think ultimately that's
one of the issues with it.

1762
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,620
The non defined structure and
non defined leadership position.

1763
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,131
Yeah.

1764
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:26,964
It can both be a,

1765
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,750
it can both be a benefit and a detraction.

1766
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,001
I mean,

1767
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,350
look at like say for example,

1768
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:31,951
Wiki leaks.

1769
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:35,400
It was like they were able to collapse
that thing by imprisoning essentially

1770
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,171
Julian assange.

1771
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:37,004
It's the guy at the top.

1772
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,220
So you take one leader,

1773
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:39,810
you can cut that head off real easy,

1774
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:40,711
but if you had,

1775
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:41,544
let's say,

1776
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,370
a lot of leaders to
some degree or a lot of,

1777
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:44,790
uh,

1778
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:45,510
you know,

1779
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:45,840
each,

1780
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,440
each different area elected somebody
to kind of run things or whatever.

1781
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,500
Did you see the salon piece on?

1782
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:51,930
Um,

1783
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:52,590
uh,

1784
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,570
on there,

1785
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,170
there were,

1786
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,240
there's discussion about
offering Edward Snowden,

1787
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:02,241
amnesty who discussion by who there's
certain NSA officials that are considering

1788
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:05,470
amnesty for Stoughton and there

1789
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,200
proposing because they're really nervous
because apparently only one percent of

1790
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:10,970
what he might have has been put out.

1791
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:13,130
So there's a lot of stuff
they're nervous about coming out.

1792
00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:13,510
So

1793
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,910
State Department Justice
Department aren't on board.

1794
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:16,720
They don't want to do it.

1795
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,150
They think it would encourage the,

1796
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:19,510
uh,

1797
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,510
future Edwards Rosa.

1798
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,833
Yeah.

1799
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,070
But man,

1800
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:24,770
if they're,

1801
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,650
if they're actually saying that though,

1802
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:26,840
they,

1803
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,220
they must be so terrified.

1804
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,180
Terrified,

1805
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,220
and in my opinion that
there's a fucking hero.

1806
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:31,910
He.

1807
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:32,061
Well,

1808
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:32,750
he's like,

1809
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,130
he's a digital Paul revere.

1810
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,733
I mean,

1811
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,040
people should be furious.

1812
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,270
Know that it's coming like,

1813
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,104
hey,

1814
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,660
look at what's being done in the enemy.

1815
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,830
The enemy is spying on you all the
time and listen whether you love Obama,

1816
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:46,401
what do you hate?

1817
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:47,234
Obama.

1818
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,310
This is a dictator's toolkit.

1819
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,270
Whether Obama's,

1820
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:51,650
let's say Obama wasn't even using it.

1821
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,440
This is a dictator's tool kit for
the next dude that gets into office.

1822
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,210
Yeah,

1823
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:59,050
and it's the idea that we're supposed
to just tolerate that because it's the

1824
00:50:59,051 --> 00:50:59,501
government.

1825
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:01,510
Like there's a whole reason
why there's a constitution.

1826
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:03,880
There's a whole reason why
people are elected into office,

1827
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,370
right?

1828
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,060
Because they're supposed to
represent our state of government.

1829
00:51:07,061 --> 00:51:10,720
They're supposed to represent some really
clearly thought out rules that were a

1830
00:51:10,721 --> 00:51:12,550
lot of the times designed to,

1831
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:13,420
to,

1832
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,610
to factor in the
possibility of corruption.

1833
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,390
So they kept out the influence of religion
and they kept out the influence of

1834
00:51:19,391 --> 00:51:20,100
corruption.

1835
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,370
There was this all done on purpose.

1836
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:23,560
It was all like really astutely engineered

1837
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,211
branches,

1838
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:24,730
all that shit.

1839
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:28,960
And slowly but surely elected officials
just chipped away and all that stuff

1840
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:29,890
just right in front of us,

1841
00:51:29,891 --> 00:51:32,680
chipped away and everyone was
busy paying attention to Kim.

1842
00:51:32,681 --> 00:51:35,470
Kardashians asked and nobody even
noticed that it was happening.

1843
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,770
Slowly but surely things
at the end day a good pass.

1844
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:39,010
No,

1845
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:39,320
no.

1846
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,280
Indefinite detention.

1847
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:40,370
Yeah.

1848
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,380
American deaths in detention
with not only that,

1849
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,060
you don't have rights to an attorney,

1850
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:44,894
you don't have.

1851
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,640
It's craziness.

1852
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,110
It's like Soviet Russia type shit.

1853
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:49,130
This is shit.

1854
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,030
It's like you can't do that.

1855
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:50,864
This is America

1856
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,250
on,

1857
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,140
on my web series.

1858
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:52,891
I interviewed,

1859
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:52,980
uh,

1860
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,611
Chris Hedges,

1861
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,970
who was one of the people taken
Obama to court over India.

1862
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,710
And uh,

1863
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,180
they,

1864
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,280
they ultimately lost,

1865
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:02,010
but they scared the shit
out of the government that
they couldn't use this thing

1866
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:04,440
where they imprison people
without a trial or charges.

1867
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:05,050
It's insane.

1868
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,790
It's so crazy that you
would want to do that.

1869
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,520
Why?

1870
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,170
Why would you want to go around all of
our checks and balances that are in place

1871
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,660
to ensure that people that are
being tried or actually guilty?

1872
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,070
Why would you want to do that?

1873
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,300
The only reason why you'd want to do that,

1874
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:19,270
if you want to use that power to
imprison people for your own whims,

1875
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,810
for your own decisions because you,

1876
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:22,100
you decided this guy's a,

1877
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:22,340
uh,

1878
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:22,690
uh,

1879
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:23,740
an enemy of your,

1880
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,430
your,

1881
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,210
your cabinet,

1882
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,640
whatever the fuck you decide
when you want that guy.

1883
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:27,900
Yeah.

1884
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,620
Demonized.

1885
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:28,990
And,

1886
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:29,330
and,

1887
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:29,790
and you know,

1888
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,000
same idea with Americans.

1889
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,500
He's got Americans on his kill
list and Eric holder was asked,

1890
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:34,831
hey,

1891
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:37,920
what would you ever take out
an American on American soil?

1892
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,120
And his response was,

1893
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,690
it would have to be a
really bad thing going on.

1894
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,070
Like,

1895
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,450
you're like,

1896
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,350
so you said yes,

1897
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,350
you would take out an
American on American soil.

1898
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,300
Like it's insanity.

1899
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,481
Well,

1900
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:49,560
they were considering doing that.

1901
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:50,460
Christopher dormer,

1902
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,353
do you remember that?

1903
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,320
Christopher dormer was the cop

1904
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:54,960
killed,

1905
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,880
killed a family of police officers,

1906
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,890
killed police officers and
killed a bunch of people.

1907
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:03,891
And then there was talk in the news and
a bunch different newspaper articles

1908
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:07,920
that I read would that he might be the
very first domestic use of the drone for

1909
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:09,190
combat and they might.

1910
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,091
Sure.

1911
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:12,610
Imagine fucking death for the sky,

1912
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:13,060
bitch,

1913
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,710
take out the whole neighborhood again,

1914
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,270
shoot a gang of cops in their family.

1915
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,550
They're going to shoot
missiles at you from the air.

1916
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,333
We have A.

1917
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,400
There's a big disparity between the
capabilities of the average American

1918
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:24,940
citizen,

1919
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,440
the human being and the government
that runs these average human beings,

1920
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,570
and whenever you have
an imbalance of power,

1921
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:33,210
you're going to have abuse because people
are going to want to have some of that

1922
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:33,601
power.

1923
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:34,530
They're gonna want to have a taste?

1924
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:37,740
You got to keep them down in order to
enjoy this position that you're in.

1925
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,240
You've got to fucking make some.

1926
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,640
Make some decisions
and be tough on people.

1927
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:42,660
And I'm looking at your email,

1928
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:42,871
bitch,

1929
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:43,704
how about that?

1930
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,071
I'll,

1931
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:44,340
I'll,

1932
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:44,580
I'll,

1933
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,320
I'll monitor every single one of your
calls because I want to make sure you know

1934
00:53:47,321 --> 00:53:47,821
a terrorist.

1935
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:48,370
Okay?

1936
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:51,960
But meanwhile you're just Bob Smith who
got elected to office and decided to

1937
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,730
change the entire rules
for running the government.

1938
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,920
Like they're not like monks.

1939
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:58,850
They're not like these guys who have
meditated for 20 years on a mountain and

1940
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:01,860
achieved enlightenment and then became
the perfect leaders for our society,

1941
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,840
but regular guys with stupid shoes,

1942
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,210
with those slippery bottom shoes,

1943
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:07,170
with tassels,

1944
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,940
fucking Weirdos.

1945
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:09,670
These guys,

1946
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:13,770
the regular rich dudes that are abusing
their power and people should be fucking

1947
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:14,551
furious about this.

1948
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,020
I don't understand why there's not

1949
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,990
more outrage because we don't feel it.

1950
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,400
That's a very good friend.

1951
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:20,290
He's a very good friend.

1952
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,141
He's a very nice guy.

1953
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:21,830
He's a writer.

1954
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,880
He's very smart,

1955
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:23,870
and he said,

1956
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,200
Oh,

1957
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,561
you know what,

1958
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:24,831
man?

1959
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:25,664
I don't feel it.

1960
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,960
I'm looking around at my friends.

1961
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:27,860
They're doing good.

1962
00:54:27,861 --> 00:54:29,090
I'm looking at a lot of my family.

1963
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:29,720
They're going good.

1964
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:29,961
I go,

1965
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:30,794
oh my God,

1966
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:31,910
that is the car.

1967
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:35,510
That's like saying that if you in
a sunny field somewhere in Kansas,

1968
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:37,760
you can't believe that
Pakistan has a tornado.

1969
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:38,843
Right?

1970
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,660
This is one of the dumbest things I've
ever heard and you can't imagine it might

1971
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:42,890
come back to you eventually.

1972
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,190
Yeah.

1973
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,590
The idea that like you're doing good
and your friends are doing good,

1974
00:54:45,591 --> 00:54:47,420
so there's not that much corruption,

1975
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:48,620
like it's not like it's.

1976
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,790
These are rumors like all
this stuff is admitted it.

1977
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:53,690
Everyone admitted it

1978
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,950
and every time you know and people
will stand up for certain things.

1979
00:54:56,951 --> 00:54:59,260
Every time they try and
pass some gun legislation.

1980
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:00,100
People get furious.

1981
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:00,490
All right,

1982
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:00,790
and I,

1983
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,040
and I'm not talking about whether
you should have guns or not,

1984
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,370
but the people who stand up for that
stuff should also stand up against this

1985
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:10,570
other stuff because all those things
you have your gun for to protect your

1986
00:55:10,571 --> 00:55:10,940
freedom,

1987
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,531
your family,

1988
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:12,160
a property,

1989
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,430
they're taking that by other
means there your freedom's gone.

1990
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:16,330
The reading your emails,

1991
00:55:16,331 --> 00:55:18,160
you can be locked away
without a trial or charges.

1992
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:21,970
Your family's indebted to student loans
and we'll end up at some job they hate

1993
00:55:21,971 --> 00:55:24,160
because they're paying that shit
off the rest of their lives.

1994
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,230
You know half your shift,

1995
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,100
your houses foreclosed on,

1996
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,770
all that shit you want to protect
with a gun they'd taken without guns.

1997
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:31,670
Why?

1998
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:32,331
Fox News?

1999
00:55:32,331 --> 00:55:32,601
Chicks.

2000
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:33,434
They're too.

2001
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:34,970
They're too hot.

2002
00:55:34,971 --> 00:55:36,440
You want to just make them happy.

2003
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,180
You want it.

2004
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,080
You want to just tell them,

2005
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:39,321
hey,

2006
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:40,250
I'm a hunter.

2007
00:55:40,251 --> 00:55:41,390
I'm a fisherman.

2008
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:42,111
Outdoorsman.

2009
00:55:42,111 --> 00:55:42,320
I mean,

2010
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,390
I think everyone should be able
to carry a concealed weapon.

2011
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,681
This is America.

2012
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:46,514
God Damn it.

2013
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:47,360
Yeah.

2014
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,620
Yeah.

2015
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,130
We have obamacare.

2016
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,730
Come on,

2017
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:50,563
get on with it.

2018
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,140
I mean,

2019
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,730
what is even trying to prove with that?

2020
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,390
No,

2021
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,050
there's a reason.

2022
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,261
Well,

2023
00:55:54,261 --> 00:55:54,790
we need to fill.

2024
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:56,300
We need to fix our healthcare system,

2025
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:59,370
but unfortunately the way he did
it was by basically saying no,

2026
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,760
the insurance companies could go nuts.

2027
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,161
Yeah.

2028
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:04,110
I think what happened is
he wanted to do something.

2029
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,990
I mean this is a total optimist.

2030
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,080
Guess that he wanted to do something
good and then the only way he was able to

2031
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:14,970
pull it off at all was to make it some
sort of a county shell game with the

2032
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,920
insurance companies
actually profit off of it,

2033
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,800
but ultimately everybody does
get some sort of healthcare.

2034
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,230
I think healthcare,

2035
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,240
I mean this is one thing that I fully
believe in healthcare and police and like

2036
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,440
cleaning the streets and disposing of
waste and all that stuff should be taken

2037
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:35,080
care of by any logical healthy society.

2038
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,910
First,

2039
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:36,790
education,

2040
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,721
education,

2041
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:38,230
health,

2042
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,063
safety,

2043
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:39,910
cleanliness,

2044
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,360
all that.

2045
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,770
Primarily that's primary.

2046
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:42,783
After that,

2047
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,490
let's worry about Janet
Jackson's nipple on television.

2048
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,303
After that,

2049
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,290
let's worry about all these other things
like the idea that people should have

2050
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,030
to pay for their own healthcare and like,

2051
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:52,870
look man,

2052
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,790
I've been at the point
of being in a society.

2053
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,624
Exactly.

2054
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,021
We can use our money,

2055
00:56:57,021 --> 00:56:57,140
right?

2056
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,060
Pay Doctors and the doctor
should be paid well,

2057
00:56:59,061 --> 00:56:59,690
by the way,

2058
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:02,560
the big problem with doctors in
these situations is that the,

2059
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:03,890
the doctors always get fucked.

2060
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:07,130
They have massive malpractice
insurance and huge student loans.

2061
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:07,970
They have to pay off.

2062
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,310
When I go to a doctor now they're
afraid to say anything because they,

2063
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,040
they think,

2064
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,431
oh well,

2065
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:13,290
it might come back to me.

2066
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:13,691
So they say,

2067
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:14,051
well,

2068
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:15,340
it could be this thing.

2069
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,040
It might not be in my.

2070
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,900
I don't know.

2071
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,431
You're like,

2072
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:18,581
Hey,

2073
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:19,201
I stubbed my toe,

2074
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:19,841
do I have cancer?

2075
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:20,350
And he was like,

2076
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:24,130
probably not because they don't want to
say you don't have cancer because then

2077
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:25,000
if you have cancer,

2078
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:25,691
they're fucked.

2079
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:25,991
Yeah.

2080
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:27,220
Then you'd sue them because.

2081
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,070
Right.

2082
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,690
About your cancer and Jesus Christ.

2083
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:34,910
But I think that there should
be a bunch of well motivated,

2084
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,580
well paid doctors and teachers
and policemen that should
be taken care of right

2085
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:43,700
away and they're going to change the
idea of the role of a policeman and the

2086
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:44,900
idea of the role of a teacher.

2087
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,190
They should be noble position.

2088
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:46,921
Right?

2089
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:47,290
Right.

2090
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,740
We shouldn't only give I,

2091
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,181
you know,

2092
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:52,810
we get perks in society to celebrities
like tables at restaurants and things

2093
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:53,170
like that.

2094
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,020
I think like the best teachers in
the country should be able to like,

2095
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,710
you know,

2096
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,160
have a fuck a 14 year old every
once while not get in trouble.

2097
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,023
Right.

2098
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,040
Fourteen year old

2099
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,120
boy and it's a girl.

2100
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,850
It's Fox News checks.

2101
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:05,760
That's a joke.

2102
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,540
Yeah.

2103
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,190
How dare you busted joke out about that.

2104
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,180
Um,

2105
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,650
do you think that there's.

2106
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,670
What are you showing more?

2107
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,371
Oh my God.

2108
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:14,720
She's putting on a God damn show.

2109
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:15,541
Well,

2110
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:16,680
she's got it down to a science.

2111
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,420
She knows exactly what that lends is.

2112
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:19,643
She's Melfi.

2113
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,693
She's very Melfi.

2114
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,853
Yeah.

2115
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,311
Those girls,

2116
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:24,780
you get them alone to go crazy on you.

2117
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,533
Um,

2118
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:27,750
I forgot what I was going to talk about.

2119
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:29,670
No,

2120
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,503
I don't.

2121
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,583
She scares me.

2122
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:35,123
I'm lucky.

2123
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:35,941
I'm lucky.

2124
00:58:35,941 --> 00:58:36,774
I'm happy.

2125
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,040
Um,

2126
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,370
did you see that video on my feet at
this fucking idiot putting his arm in a

2127
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:42,870
tiger's mouth is playing with a tiger.

2128
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,150
Go back to,

2129
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:45,984
uh,

2130
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,760
go on my feet about nine hours ago on
my twitter feed is the most ridiculous

2131
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:51,594
thing ever.

2132
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,520
I can't believe this guy was willing to
do this and just hopes that this tiger

2133
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:58,320
plays plays along with them.

2134
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,650
It's so hard to watch the
Tigers biting his arm.

2135
00:59:01,651 --> 00:59:06,480
Like it has this entire arm and its mouth
and it's got these huge giant teeth.

2136
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,920
See if he gets spread that out.

2137
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:09,111
Where was he?

2138
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:10,080
That he had a tiger?

2139
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,621
I don't know.

2140
00:59:10,621 --> 00:59:11,610
I think he's a trainer,

2141
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,140
but look at this crazy ass hole.

2142
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,831
Oh my God.

2143
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:16,170
This tiger is literally
biting his whole arm.

2144
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:17,970
It's so big.

2145
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,080
That head is so big.

2146
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:20,310
It would just snap his arm.

2147
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:20,640
Right?

2148
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,110
Uh,

2149
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:24,470
anytime it wants to and he's just
sticking it in there and look at the dog.

2150
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,210
How about that dog that's
circling the situation?

2151
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,531
He's like,

2152
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,210
what the fuck is that?

2153
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,410
Did you see the dog?

2154
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,450
That poor dog is like,

2155
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,670
maybe he fills up the dog doesn't
know what the fuck to do the dog.

2156
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:37,911
He's like,

2157
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:38,121
okay,

2158
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:39,770
what the fuck is that?

2159
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:40,690
The dog,

2160
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:44,840
the tire gets filled up on dogs and
then doesn't need the human and the dog

2161
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:45,830
doesn't know what the fuck to do.

2162
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,040
He's not going to protect you.

2163
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,340
Did you see the guy that
sleeps with a tiger?

2164
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,050
And like dogs like this,

2165
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,040
like this tiger is just like,

2166
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:52,341
hey,

2167
00:59:52,341 --> 00:59:53,174
I'm just hanging out.

2168
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:53,411
Yeah,

2169
00:59:53,411 --> 00:59:55,480
these people are assholes.

2170
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,740
These people are assholes.

2171
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,610
You know why?

2172
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,530
Because they encourage
other people to do this too.

2173
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,690
And maybe you can pull it off.

2174
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,510
Maybe you have this incredible
rapport with tigers,

2175
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:09,010
but this idea that we're supposed to do
a lot of really dangerous shit with big,

2176
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:09,431
wild,

2177
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:12,370
dangerous animals is so fucking stupid.

2178
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,650
You just shouldn't be
surprised when that duty.

2179
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:16,490
It's that guy.

2180
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:16,721
Well,

2181
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:19,120
we played a video last week of this train.

2182
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:21,550
Bear attacking the trainers.

2183
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:22,900
I think it was a train
is one of the trainers,

2184
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:24,430
relatives like his brother
or something like that.

2185
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,370
This bear just got to nowhere.

2186
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,030
I just decided to rip his
throat out there doing these,

2187
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:29,910
these things there.

2188
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,450
They're training them.

2189
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,770
The guys just standing there.

2190
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:35,050
The guy's not threatening the
bear at all and the bear says,

2191
01:00:35,051 --> 01:00:35,884
you know what,

2192
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,570
I'm just going to fuck
this dude up real quick.

2193
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,510
Just attached rips them apart.

2194
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,180
Maybe it was when you tried to put them
on the tricycle and he decided he'd had

2195
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:43,590
enough.

2196
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,530
Did you ever see that video
where the bear eats the monkey?

2197
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,370
No.

2198
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,120
Oh my God.

2199
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,800
It's a Russian circus bear.

2200
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:50,371
Pull that shit out.

2201
01:00:50,371 --> 01:00:53,440
Brian Russian circus bear
attacks monkey there.

2202
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,790
There was a monkey driving a bike and
the bear was driving a bike and they

2203
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,230
collided the monkey foul and
the bear ran over the monkey.

2204
01:00:59,231 --> 01:00:59,800
Yeah.

2205
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:04,800
Atacheo kids watching at a circus and
the bear just decided to fuck that monkey

2206
01:01:06,191 --> 01:01:07,700
up because the bear didn't know.

2207
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,840
I thought it was being
attacked by the monkey to do.

2208
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:10,683
Not that smart.

2209
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:11,703
They're in pain.

2210
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:12,550
They fell.

2211
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:13,420
They see the monkey,

2212
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:13,921
the preacher.

2213
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:14,890
That monkey caused this,

2214
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,140
so they just bid bites the
shit out of this monkey.

2215
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,400
During Shakespeare's time,

2216
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:23,320
one of the most popular shows was a monkey
riding a horse and then a bear would

2217
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:26,110
try and like eat the monkey
or whatever it was called.

2218
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,960
It was called bear baiting and Oh my God,

2219
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:29,980
they fucking loved it.

2220
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:30,890
I've heard of it.

2221
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,270
Bear baiting and other ways.

2222
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,400
I've heard a one bear baiting thing.

2223
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:38,750
Would they take a pit bulls and they
would tie the bear down by chains.

2224
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,990
Then release the dogs on him and see how
many dogs it took to take down a bear.

2225
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,300
The bear is frustrated because
he was losing to I think,

2226
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,280
but I don't think there's a competitive,

2227
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,090
like watch the monkey falls in the bear,

2228
01:01:51,091 --> 01:01:52,140
falls on the monkey,

2229
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:52,921
and he's like bitch.

2230
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:54,090
And just attacks him.

2231
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:54,331
Oh,

2232
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:56,790
so he was like using the bike
to catch the monkey and eat him.

2233
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,301
No,

2234
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:57,511
no,

2235
01:01:57,511 --> 01:01:57,721
no,

2236
01:01:57,721 --> 01:01:57,901
no,

2237
01:01:57,901 --> 01:01:58,081
no.

2238
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:01,650
The monkey fell when the
bear ran over the monkey.

2239
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,080
It's not the bay.

2240
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:03,440
The bears,

2241
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,620
not a strategy guy.

2242
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,800
Thinking five steps ahead.

2243
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:10,560
I kind of figured out how to fuck this
monkey up and make it look like it's his

2244
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:11,350
fault.

2245
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:12,330
They just did.

2246
01:02:12,331 --> 01:02:14,760
A documentary is supposed
to be good about that.

2247
01:02:14,761 --> 01:02:16,470
A killer whale that ate the trainer.

2248
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:17,040
Oh,

2249
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,120
the about blackfish?

2250
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:18,930
Yeah,

2251
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:19,590
no doubt.

2252
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:19,891
Yeah.

2253
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:20,100
We

2254
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,940
had one of the guys in from marine land
that was originally want to till it

2255
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,780
comes trainers.

2256
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:25,410
Oh really?

2257
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:25,651
Yeah.

2258
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:27,540
We had him in a couple of weeks ago,

2259
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:28,380
Phil Dimmers,

2260
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,420
and he was fascinating.

2261
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,600
He was telling us like,

2262
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,570
how it's just a goddamn business.

2263
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,000
Like they don't give a fuck about those.

2264
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:36,570
They treat him like shit.

2265
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:37,710
Those animals were really smart.

2266
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,191
Wow.

2267
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:39,660
This pan is fucking this dude up

2268
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:41,450
dude.

2269
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,280
I've never seen a panda
that excited about anything.

2270
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:43,461
Yeah,

2271
01:02:43,461 --> 01:02:45,400
you would think a panda wouldn't
really give a fuck about you.

2272
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,300
Once that jacket,

2273
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,690
he was wearing Jean jacket on genes.

2274
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,713
Genes.

2275
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,680
It turns out Jay Leno look,

2276
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,633
he's like,

2277
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:56,910
I hate prison.

2278
01:02:57,010 --> 01:03:00,440
Turns out a panda is a
bear at the end of the day,

2279
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,051
he's like,

2280
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:01,884
I hate prison.

2281
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,460
Come on,

2282
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,271
why you got me in prison?

2283
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:04,104
You fucks.

2284
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,400
But I'm.

2285
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,870
Phil was talking to us about marine land,

2286
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:08,220
about how depressing it has seen those,

2287
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:12,000
those workers trapped in these fish tanks
and they want to have sex with their

2288
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:17,001
kids because it just confused and
they're isolated and it's really,

2289
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:18,474
really evil.

2290
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,890
If you haven't seen blackfish,

2291
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,360
go see it and if you haven't seen the
podcast with Phil was very enlightening

2292
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:27,480
and eyeopening and if you
go to save smooshy.com,

2293
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:31,470
you can actually aid in his legal
defense because he's getting sued by the

2294
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:35,160
people of marine land who
really cancel seaworld Gig.

2295
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:35,611
Yeah.

2296
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:36,960
Martina mcbride is one of them.

2297
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:37,794
Willie Nelson.

2298
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:39,250
Joan Jett canceled.

2299
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:39,370
Yeah.

2300
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,470
These are just the latest ones.

2301
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,370
Everybody has canceled.

2302
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:42,610
They.

2303
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,520
They should boycott those things.

2304
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:45,540
Those things are prisons.

2305
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,130
Those are prisons for aliens.

2306
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,620
The aliens that live under the
water and they're smart as shit.

2307
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,920
And if we found them on another
planet and we will worship them.

2308
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,280
Right?

2309
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:52,860
Right.

2310
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:55,830
But because they're in the ocean and
because we can catch them with these big

2311
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:57,390
nets and scooping up with cranes,

2312
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,230
we do it.

2313
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,100
We're assholes.

2314
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,300
People who run seaworld,

2315
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,130
you are fucking assholes.

2316
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,400
No one knows those dolphins and
whales more than you guys do.

2317
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,420
And you know what you're doing.

2318
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:07,380
So fuck you.

2319
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,550
I've never gone to sea world.

2320
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:10,860
I never will go to see
what I've always thought.

2321
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:13,890
Cal was fucked up and
talking to this guy just.

2322
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,190
He just cemented that thought in my mind.

2323
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:17,940
It's just,

2324
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,680
it's not because they grab them as kids.

2325
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:20,200
I mean the part,

2326
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:20,461
the part.

2327
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:21,930
I only saw two minutes of the documentary,

2328
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:25,080
but they grabbed the kids out of the
water and the rest of the whales wait

2329
01:04:25,081 --> 01:04:27,810
around because they don't want to leave
because they realize one of them has

2330
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:29,200
been trapped and it's so fucked,

2331
01:04:29,201 --> 01:04:29,580
dude.

2332
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,151
They're smart,

2333
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:30,600
man.

2334
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:30,771
It's,

2335
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:31,604
it's,

2336
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:32,700
we can't do that.

2337
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,750
That's not cool.

2338
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,090
You can't do that just because you can't
understand what they're saying when

2339
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:36,924
they complain.

2340
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,370
We know they're smart.

2341
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,140
You know?

2342
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,950
It's one of the most evil things.

2343
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:41,191
I mean,

2344
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:42,540
it's essentially slavery.

2345
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:46,350
It's no different than slavery and
the idea that it is like this is not a

2346
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:47,160
goldfish.

2347
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:47,551
Okay.

2348
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,380
You can take a gold fish and
do whatever you want to it.

2349
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:50,190
I don't give a shit.

2350
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,540
You could eat a goldfish for a prank.

2351
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,740
You will never hear me complain.

2352
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:53,820
You know why?

2353
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,110
Because goldfish aren't smart.

2354
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:59,010
I like smart things and
things that are really smart.

2355
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,230
Know not like dogs,

2356
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:00,890
pigs,

2357
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:01,201
smart.

2358
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:04,050
Like dolphins are really fucking smart.

2359
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:06,990
Like kind of people
smart in some weird way.

2360
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:07,941
And you,

2361
01:05:07,941 --> 01:05:10,080
you're an asshole if you put that
in the fucking swimming pool.

2362
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,190
They like use tools.

2363
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:12,123
Yeah.

2364
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:12,820
Well they're.

2365
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,560
They're maniacs and they do a lot of bad
things and there's a video of a master

2366
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:17,351
of masturbating.

2367
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:19,000
Dolphin was fucking a headless fish.

2368
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:20,990
They're crazy.

2369
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,940
They're hypersexual is side.

2370
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,150
There's a lot of humans.

2371
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,650
You got your genius is and then you've
got the ones that are seeing how big the

2372
01:05:27,651 --> 01:05:28,470
asshole.

2373
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:31,140
No doubt and much like humans,

2374
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:32,790
the vast majority of them are good.

2375
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:33,630
You know,

2376
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:37,320
if you're walking around on
the street in any normal city,

2377
01:05:37,321 --> 01:05:40,290
the vast majority of the people that you
run into are good people and not trying

2378
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:41,080
to be criminals.

2379
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,920
They're not trying to hurt others
or just most people are good people.

2380
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,340
It's just the ones that are
not good stand out to me.

2381
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,690
Focus on them and it becomes something
that people want to pay attention.

2382
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:50,800
I have a,

2383
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,730
I have a thing I do in my act about how
these top billionaires like the Koch

2384
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:56,320
brothers and shit like we,

2385
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:59,620
I hate when people go to them for
advice on like how to run the society.

2386
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:00,090
Like they're,

2387
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,260
they're psychopaths.

2388
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:05,170
I mean there you wouldn't respect
anyone else who collects a billion of

2389
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:06,400
something or like,

2390
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:06,800
you know,

2391
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,770
if you find that someone's
got a million shoes,

2392
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:09,101
you know,

2393
01:06:09,101 --> 01:06:10,210
they have a fucking problem.

2394
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,370
What about if a guy like Bill Gates,

2395
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,680
I think I've read everything I've heard.

2396
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:18,280
He's kind of a psychopath to not
the not the initial inventing stuff.

2397
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:18,910
It's the,

2398
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,060
it's what you do after that.

2399
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:21,323
Right?

2400
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:21,541
Well,

2401
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:22,021
what is it?

2402
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:24,660
Is it just that he kept going and kept
making more and more and more to the

2403
01:06:24,661 --> 01:06:25,494
point where he just,

2404
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:26,880
who needs $90,000,000,

2405
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:27,210
dude?

2406
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:27,361
Well,

2407
01:06:27,361 --> 01:06:28,220
it's not just make it,

2408
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:28,650
it's,

2409
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:29,850
I mean the way they make more.

2410
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:32,010
I don't know specifically
about what Microsoft does,

2411
01:06:32,011 --> 01:06:33,570
but it's a lot of like,

2412
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,090
you know,

2413
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,690
tearing apart anybody else that
could threaten them and does apple,

2414
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:39,370
you know,

2415
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,360
apple is pretty ruthless.

2416
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:41,170
I'm not defending any.

2417
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,070
It comes to competition.

2418
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,400
All these businesses where
they're making tons of money,

2419
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,180
you know,

2420
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,050
they protect that shit.

2421
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,070
It's a game.

2422
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,780
It's just like protecting your pieces.

2423
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:50,614
If you're playing chess,

2424
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:52,240
if you're in the business to make money,

2425
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:52,620
that's,

2426
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:52,820
you know,

2427
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:53,790
you offer good products.

2428
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:55,060
So your conscience is clear.

2429
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,680
I mean apple makes a hell of a laptop,

2430
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,790
they make great stuff,

2431
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:58,624
but

2432
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,710
I don't know if they're conscious,

2433
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:03,760
if they're kind of looking at the
netting around the Foxconn factory in us.

2434
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,420
Essentially no one

2435
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,310
can be.

2436
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:10,540
No one can be conscience clear because
we all get these conflict minerals that

2437
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:14,680
power electronics and they almost all
come from impoverished areas with a lot

2438
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:15,220
of,

2439
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,760
for the longest time that Congo
is of slaves that were doing it.

2440
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,190
Still still is in a lot of places.

2441
01:07:21,191 --> 01:07:22,024
I mean,

2442
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,340
vice did some powerful work on that.

2443
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:24,970
Uh,

2444
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:25,620
Shane Smith,

2445
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,650
it will be here on Wednesday.

2446
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,281
They,

2447
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,030
um,

2448
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:30,760
they went there and they
investigated the whole what's,

2449
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,571
what's going on,

2450
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:32,980
like why do we need to be here?

2451
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:33,311
Like what,

2452
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:33,720
what is,

2453
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,260
what is,

2454
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,160
what's the main appeal?

2455
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:37,690
And it's cold hands cold Tanja.

2456
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,370
It's stuff that they
used to make cell phones.

2457
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:40,810
We need it all cell phones.

2458
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,040
So it's almost impossible to like have
a conflict free like electric car.

2459
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,471
But here's the thing,

2460
01:07:48,471 --> 01:07:49,251
you could pay,

2461
01:07:49,251 --> 01:07:50,090
I mean a different.

2462
01:07:50,091 --> 01:07:51,440
If our system was set up differently,

2463
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:55,100
you could pay those workers
mining that Colton a nice wage,

2464
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,420
a livable wage.

2465
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:57,523
No Shit.

2466
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,650
There was a um,

2467
01:07:58,890 --> 01:07:59,240
there's,

2468
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,073
there's some,

2469
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,320
I don't know if they ever got done,

2470
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:02,750
but I know it was,

2471
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:06,250
it was a proposition to
make cell phones that were,

2472
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,320
there's a thing called
free phone and everything,

2473
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:14,020
but I think they only went when they only
had like three g they didn't have like

2474
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:16,490
for lte that we're like a step behind

2475
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:17,570
where people are like,

2476
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,433
oh,

2477
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,460
I need the latest shit.

2478
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,020
I want to,

2479
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:21,831
I want to save the world.

2480
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,150
But the cell phone that I had last year,

2481
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,280
it's not good enough.

2482
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:25,791
Listen,

2483
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:26,571
I need some new shoes.

2484
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:27,560
I need to save the world.

2485
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,970
But this cell phones a month old.

2486
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,520
So at htc one,

2487
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:31,363
can you do that?

2488
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,230
Can you make me one of those
people don't want the older shit.

2489
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:36,350
We've,

2490
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,990
we've been carefully trained
to not want the eldership.

2491
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,213
Is that what it is?

2492
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:41,603
We've been trained,

2493
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,620
isn't it though?

2494
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,470
Isn't it just a natural human
inclination to always want the best?

2495
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,210
Yeah.

2496
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,930
So I think it's a natural
human inclination.

2497
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:48,764
Like I,

2498
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,210
I feel that materialism.

2499
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,700
I think materialism is
obviously an empty pursuit.

2500
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:52,850
I mean,

2501
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:56,090
I don't think anybody can argue that
the pursuit of objects ultimately over

2502
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:59,900
everything over emotions and friendships
and love affairs does stupid,

2503
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,990
stupid objects are not
going to make you happy.

2504
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,900
You need all those other things,

2505
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,780
but if you have all those other things,

2506
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,070
then objects are pretty cool.

2507
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:08,663
You know?

2508
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,530
I mean if,

2509
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,140
if somebody gives you like a really
dope lamp and you put it in your office,

2510
01:09:13,141 --> 01:09:13,371
you're like,

2511
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:15,890
this thing is fucking bad
ass and you look at it,

2512
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:16,970
it gives you like a good feeling.

2513
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,220
That's a bacterial thing that you own.

2514
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:22,790
That's actually pretty nice and
artworks falls into that as well.

2515
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:23,181
I mean,

2516
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:24,770
our work essentially is materialism.

2517
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:25,970
If you're collecting paintings,

2518
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:26,931
I mean you're,

2519
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:30,260
you're collecting someone's
expression and someone's work,

2520
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:32,270
but you're also collecting
a material thing,

2521
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:32,930
right?

2522
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,090
You're collecting an object,

2523
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:35,001
but I think.

2524
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:37,490
I think it's a vicious
cycle in which we're,

2525
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,580
we're told to always want
the newest one and they are.

2526
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,600
The companies were rewarded for designing
something that changes every month.

2527
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:45,040
I mean,

2528
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:45,680
I boot it up.

2529
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,820
I hadn't used my ipad and I just didn't
have any use for it for like two years

2530
01:09:49,821 --> 01:09:50,870
and I rebooted it up.

2531
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:52,400
Nothing works with it anymore.

2532
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:56,870
You can't know apps work nothing because
it's designed to kick you off and say,

2533
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:57,021
Oh,

2534
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:57,920
you gotta get a new one,

2535
01:09:57,921 --> 01:09:58,490
or what are you going to,

2536
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:58,761
you know,

2537
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,440
everything stops working well.

2538
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,120
There's a reason for that though.

2539
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:06,560
The reason for that engineering wise
is that they want to be able to control

2540
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:09,920
their product ultimately and they want
to make it the best experience possible.

2541
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,053
Like there's A.

2542
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,130
There's not a logical,

2543
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:16,550
but there's a technological reason for
some of the only updating the operating

2544
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:16,941
system.

2545
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:19,190
Constantly updating the
applications constantly.

2546
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,143
They improve them,

2547
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:21,170
they get them out of time,

2548
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:23,900
but changing the shape of the
changing the shape of the plug.

2549
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,330
Oh well you can't have the old plug,

2550
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:31,360
but it transfers data quicker and it was
that they had the old books in the new

2551
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:33,140
plugs a million times if you will.

2552
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:33,501
Right,

2553
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:34,610
and you're wrong at the same time.

2554
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:35,151
You're right.

2555
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:37,220
If you want to think as
far as economics and like,

2556
01:10:37,221 --> 01:10:37,341
yeah,

2557
01:10:37,341 --> 01:10:38,360
you should be able to save people money,

2558
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:39,590
let him use a USB plug.

2559
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,170
Why do you have to have this
thing that nobody else has?

2560
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:45,080
But the thing that nobody
else has works better,

2561
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,430
which is it's a better.

2562
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:47,990
It transfers data quicker.

2563
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:49,040
It's a better connection.

2564
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:49,670
Allegedly.

2565
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,503
What do I know?

2566
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:51,723
If you have,

2567
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,100
if you have like a playstation one goal,

2568
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:58,310
you're not going to play it like a
playstation four shit called five.

2569
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,390
What is the new thing?

2570
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:00,680
Lightening Bolt connection.

2571
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:01,940
Is that what it is?

2572
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,420
Is that.

2573
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,980
And is that what connects your,

2574
01:11:03,981 --> 01:11:04,460
um,

2575
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,660
like a iphone five?

2576
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:06,110
Yeah,

2577
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,460
lightening bolt connector better.

2578
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:07,851
Okay.

2579
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:08,630
Here's the question.

2580
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,871
Oh yeah,

2581
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:09,531
it's a lot better.

2582
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,440
It's a lot faster and
it's a different USB.

2583
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:13,020
Also.

2584
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,860
The old one is

2585
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,150
a lot slower.

2586
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:16,591
The connections.

2587
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:17,241
Remember like,

2588
01:11:17,241 --> 01:11:17,810
uh,

2589
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,660
where uh,

2590
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,490
you would always have
problems with like plugs,

2591
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:20,701
like,

2592
01:11:20,701 --> 01:11:24,540
or if he had like a alarm clock that
had a doc system in it always had that

2593
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,420
wiggle thing where you had
to put something behind it
just to get it connected.

2594
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:31,890
That's because it was just not a well
designed plug for multiple years.

2595
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,453
Yeah,

2596
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,570
apparently it does.

2597
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,231
It does.

2598
01:11:36,231 --> 01:11:37,280
It transfers data,

2599
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,020
quicker transfers.

2600
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:39,920
Wow.

2601
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,230
Data up to 10 gigabytes per second.

2602
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:45,500
Double the speed of current
USB three point zero.

2603
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,660
So that just answered it.

2604
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,050
We're only talking about tech.

2605
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:48,830
I mean there's,

2606
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:49,663
there's other things.

2607
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:54,800
Shelves shelves collapsed and a
month now I get like Ikea Shit.

2608
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:55,071
Yeah.

2609
01:11:55,071 --> 01:11:58,550
But we're talking about
updating applications and
how your ipad wouldn't work

2610
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:01,520
and I really think that that's because
they're just constantly upgrading shit

2611
01:12:01,521 --> 01:12:03,890
and then making it better
and faster and I agree.

2612
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:05,840
It's frustrating if you're
trying to save money,

2613
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,940
but if you're not trying to save money,

2614
01:12:07,941 --> 01:12:09,020
that's what you want them to do.

2615
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:09,531
You know,

2616
01:12:09,531 --> 01:12:11,300
you want everybody to
push the latest shit,

2617
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,560
you know,

2618
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:11,871
like Oh,

2619
01:12:11,871 --> 01:12:12,231
so what?

2620
01:12:12,231 --> 01:12:13,070
I have to get a new plug,

2621
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,300
but now my business can transfer its data
in 20 minutes as opposed to 40 minutes

2622
01:12:17,301 --> 01:12:18,050
or so.

2623
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,190
I've got the older phone,

2624
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:22,070
whatever this says the android and I've
had it for like two years and I still

2625
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:22,904
works fine.

2626
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,320
I just don't have the fastest phone.

2627
01:12:24,321 --> 01:12:25,100
He's telling my dad,

2628
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:25,933
what's going on with you?

2629
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:26,893
You're a young man.

2630
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:27,620
You're young,

2631
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,453
you're healthy.

2632
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,660
I don't need the fastest phone

2633
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:32,161
works fine.

2634
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:32,421
It works,

2635
01:12:32,421 --> 01:12:34,040
but I used to joke about that.

2636
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:35,150
I use a carrier pigeon.

2637
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:38,180
I you do a joke about 12 years.

2638
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,650
No one ever looks at cell phones.

2639
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:39,861
It goes,

2640
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:40,071
okay,

2641
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:40,460
that's it.

2642
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,293
We're done.

2643
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,143
We're done.

2644
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,283
Screen's big enough.

2645
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:44,203
Fast enough.

2646
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,100
It's not gonna happen like we,

2647
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,240
for whatever reason,

2648
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:48,320
we need the latest,

2649
01:12:48,321 --> 01:12:49,154
greatest shit.

2650
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:50,530
We all do.

2651
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:53,260
And you might not because
you're a fucking loser.

2652
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:54,081
Bohemian.

2653
01:12:54,081 --> 01:12:55,970
Which a two year old ipad.

2654
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,790
I'll pull out my etch a sketch.

2655
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:00,440
It's,

2656
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,340
it was good for a laugh

2657
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,833
glances.

2658
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,281
Yeah.

2659
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:04,980
I think.

2660
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,830
I honestly think that
what we're talking about,

2661
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:07,491
materialism,

2662
01:13:07,491 --> 01:13:08,720
although it's kind of an empty pursuit,

2663
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:11,270
I really think that it's one
of the things that's pushing,

2664
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,350
um,

2665
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:14,690
what human beings are doing
on this planet overall,

2666
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:16,490
which is advancing technology.

2667
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:18,110
I think one of the things that we do,

2668
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:21,170
if you looked at us just
completely outside of our culture,

2669
01:13:21,171 --> 01:13:22,070
outside of your life,

2670
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:22,990
outside of your,

2671
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:23,640
your you know,

2672
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:28,310
your reality and looked at this swarm
of beings and what's at the forefront of

2673
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:29,081
swarm of beings.

2674
01:13:29,081 --> 01:13:29,914
It's objects.

2675
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,570
They're constantly creating newer cars,

2676
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,361
bigger tvs,

2677
01:13:32,361 --> 01:13:33,171
better computers,

2678
01:13:33,171 --> 01:13:33,950
better phones,

2679
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,840
constantly obsessing objects,

2680
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:39,140
and they're working jobs they don't
even enjoy just to feed the machine that

2681
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:40,070
creates these objects,

2682
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,870
which is a really sad.

2683
01:13:41,871 --> 01:13:44,780
When you get a job they don't enjoy.

2684
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,673
I don't know if it's.

2685
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:47,060
There's a lot of people though.

2686
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,513
That's my point.

2687
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:51,440
A good percentage of people made a mistake
somewhere and did something that they

2688
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:52,274
don't want to do.

2689
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,670
Good percentage that did it for just a
living and there's no passion to their

2690
01:13:55,671 --> 01:13:56,240
life.

2691
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,110
It's a good percentage.

2692
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,710
I wonder though if when you see all
this symbiotic connection that we have,

2693
01:14:00,711 --> 01:14:01,610
like with cell phones,

2694
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:03,740
like you can't leave your house
about yourself when you feel weird.

2695
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:04,870
You know,

2696
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:06,430
you're talking about the google glass.

2697
01:14:06,431 --> 01:14:09,320
We're going to have to be aware that
we're becoming more and more addicted to

2698
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:12,010
all these closer and
closer and closer to it to.

2699
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,620
It might be the whole reason for
materialism in the first place.

2700
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:14,981
It might be.

2701
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:16,300
That's the pole of materialism.

2702
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:20,260
Materialism might ultimately be the engine
that creates a symbiotic relationship

2703
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:20,880
between pizza.

2704
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,300
Very positive way to look at them.

2705
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:24,910
I don't even think it's positive
because it sounds pretty negative,

2706
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:25,640
you know,

2707
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,400
this wouldn't be a lot
of shit that's different.

2708
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,181
I do agree.

2709
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:31,660
I mean technology is increasing
exponentially and in some
ways it's great and in

2710
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:34,710
some ways like I feel like we could be
using it for better things and when like

2711
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:35,710
the,

2712
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,060
the,

2713
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,830
the drone Amazon delivery system that
they've been talking about like alright,

2714
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:44,110
it's lovely you're bringing a slap chop
to an agoraphobic obese coleslaw addict.

2715
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:45,100
But you know,

2716
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,980
couldn't those drones be used
for something more important?

2717
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:48,671
Well for them,

2718
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:49,211
I mean their,

2719
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:50,680
their business is selling people shit,

2720
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:51,670
so why would they do that?

2721
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,121
Right.

2722
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,760
There's obviously other drones,

2723
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,140
but if they're going to use
that drone for their business,

2724
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,220
at least it's cool.

2725
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:00,340
At least you know you're hanging out in
the city and see drones fly by dropping

2726
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:01,174
off packages.

2727
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,280
That's some more wealthy and shit though,

2728
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:03,670
man.

2729
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah.

2730
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,970
I don't trust those people.

2731
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:06,880
They're going to break.

2732
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,050
I get nervous about a Roomba.

2733
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:08,620
Don't know.

2734
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:08,900
I don't know.

2735
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:12,040
He's reporting back to when is one of
I'm going to run out of batteries and

2736
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,900
spiral run into some
little kid's stroller.

2737
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,600
Oh yeah.

2738
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,910
The first week it's going to happen.

2739
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,300
You can't tell me those things or feel
proof and how about people shooting

2740
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:19,871
amount of sky.

2741
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:22,580
You're going to get some
crazy rednecks like Colorado.

2742
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:24,580
They passed a law in some area.

2743
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:26,730
Colorado allowing you to shoot drones.

2744
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:28,140
Yeah.

2745
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:28,990
They can't do it,

2746
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:29,980
but they can try.

2747
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:30,650
You get it all out.

2748
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:30,881
Well,

2749
01:15:30,881 --> 01:15:32,830
if you have a high speed
rifle and it's hovering,

2750
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,930
if you catch it hovering and
you have a shitty Ras guy,

2751
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:37,860
people to tell them at the Amazon drone.

2752
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,190
It's not the full sized drones.

2753
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,590
They're talking about drones period.

2754
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,420
This state,

2755
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,360
Colorado loud.

2756
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,690
I just didn't know if it was
possible for the type of yeah,

2757
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:49,421
you can do it.

2758
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:49,990
It's been done.

2759
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,640
They've done it with rocket launchers,

2760
01:15:51,641 --> 01:15:53,350
they've done it with like
heat seeking missiles.

2761
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:54,820
I know they've taken drones out before.

2762
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,043
Definitely.

2763
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,440
And if you have a high powered
rifle with a scope and it hovers.

2764
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,580
If it's not like moving again,

2765
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:02,081
if ain't even.

2766
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:02,831
If it is moving,

2767
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:03,664
you can lead it,

2768
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,210
you know,

2769
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,410
if you're a really good sniper,

2770
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:06,244
like one of those marines,

2771
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:09,370
a lot of the time they're supposed to
be a mile up where you can't see them.

2772
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,121
Oh,

2773
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:10,954
that makes sense.

2774
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:11,800
Yeah.

2775
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,370
If they're mild,

2776
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,870
well I guess they can be right.

2777
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,100
I mean they could be as high up as
they want to know people in there.

2778
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:16,934
They're often like,

2779
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:19,120
when they're bombing over in Afghanistan,

2780
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:20,800
you can't see them so crazy.

2781
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:24,650
It's such a weird thing that we
just accepted that as part of our.

2782
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,780
Our civilization.

2783
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,610
Yeah.

2784
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:27,010
Yeah.

2785
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:30,190
How far we've come over the past
50 used to be like 10 years ago.

2786
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:30,761
If someone was like,

2787
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:31,060
dude,

2788
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,890
this drones taking people
that you'd be like,

2789
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,110
well,

2790
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,120
what are you smoking?

2791
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:38,440
And they don't even try to
make it seem like it's just,

2792
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,270
at least the Patriot Act was called.

2793
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:41,140
The Patriot Act,

2794
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:42,460
you know what I mean,

2795
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:47,110
like this is they've given up on
the Wellington Hellfire missiles.

2796
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,460
Hell fire.

2797
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:49,330
What does it say up there,

2798
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:49,600
Brian?

2799
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,080
What did the uh,

2800
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,020
the headline say,

2801
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,040
alright it's town vote on
drone ordinance postpone.

2802
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,700
Oh,

2803
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,990
someone got a hold of them.

2804
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,820
But yeah,

2805
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:58,450
they were gonna.

2806
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,420
They were gonna make it so
it'd be who shoot drones.

2807
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,793
Oh,

2808
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:06,521
we're so crazy.

2809
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,860
I'm never going to happen because there's
bullets are going to fall down and hit

2810
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:09,870
people and shit like that.

2811
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:14,390
Well that happens every year on New
Year's and these assholes go shooting off

2812
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:14,841
their guns.

2813
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:15,800
Bullets land on people.

2814
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:16,700
Yeah.

2815
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,620
People die every year of that
somewhere in the country.

2816
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:20,270
So when the world sounds awesome,

2817
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:21,830
there's something beautiful
about that terrible.

2818
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:23,860
One hundred 50 people die every
year because coconuts falling there.

2819
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:24,860
Yeah.

2820
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,650
Know far more people die from peanut
allergies in this country than terrorism.

2821
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,371
Isn't that crazy?

2822
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:29,750
Peanuts or a motherfucker.

2823
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,640
That's my argument against.

2824
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:34,790
We'd like when Dr drew type characters
start talking about like the the

2825
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:37,880
withdrawal symptoms of
we like a not so much,

2826
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:41,020
not for like normal people for
one of the peanut allergy freaks.

2827
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:41,913
Yeah,

2828
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:42,501
it will.

2829
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:44,540
And it's the weeds not kill
as many people as peanuts.

2830
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:45,470
It's not killing anybody,

2831
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:49,880
but I mean even the people that get these
withdrawal syndromes like peanuts or

2832
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:50,714
worse,

2833
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,590
like peanuts,

2834
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,410
peanuts are a higher percentage of
people like the amount of people that are

2835
01:17:54,411 --> 01:17:56,030
getting like really addicted to weed.

2836
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:57,920
Oh my God isn't even one in a thousand.

2837
01:17:57,921 --> 01:17:58,850
What are the symptoms like?

2838
01:17:58,851 --> 01:17:59,520
Boredom.

2839
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,353
Just bored.

2840
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:01,281
Well,

2841
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:02,330
they say that they can't.

2842
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:03,320
They have to have it.

2843
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:03,800
They can't.

2844
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,790
I think they're idiots.

2845
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:05,601
I really do.

2846
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:08,210
I think a lot of them that talk
about being addicted to weed,

2847
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:08,720
they're idiots.

2848
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,350
I buy the ones that say if they do weeds
and they'll start doing coke and then

2849
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,820
they get crazy because it
doesn't that start earlier,

2850
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:14,690
like alcohol,

2851
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,370
like do you have to put it on weed?

2852
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:17,750
Is the gateway will also.

2853
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:19,490
It's like why do you have
to put it on anything?

2854
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,160
Because what you're really doing is taking
something that's innocuous and you're

2855
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,550
just doing your natural
escalating whether you would,

2856
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:26,900
you would do with masturbating,

2857
01:18:26,901 --> 01:18:27,681
with gambling,

2858
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:28,491
with prostitution.

2859
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:29,630
You're a fucking crazy person,

2860
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:30,030
right?

2861
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:30,250
You know,

2862
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,190
you're just looking to get nutty,

2863
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,440
nutty.

2864
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,250
And then you blame the weed.

2865
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,080
Then Dr drew's got you on
the couch and it's like,

2866
01:18:36,081 --> 01:18:38,450
when did you know that
you were out of control?

2867
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:39,740
The we'd pulled me.

2868
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:41,030
It was a grip I,

2869
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:41,780
I needed,

2870
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,960
I couldn't get up without a bond yet,

2871
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,120
like the girl's an idiot.

2872
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,880
But the first time I fucked I was like,

2873
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:48,380
this is really exciting
and I want to do this more.

2874
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,090
Yeah,

2875
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:49,680
it can be that.

2876
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,920
And I did a weed and then moved on.

2877
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,150
Yeah,

2878
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:53,630
I think,

2879
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:54,463
uh,

2880
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:55,820
it's,

2881
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,250
it's like we were talking about
earlier with the whole Fox thing.

2882
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:03,310
It's like there's teams and the teams
don't recognize that it's not an either or

2883
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:05,540
thing is a lot of weirdness.

2884
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:06,423
This life,

2885
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,820
this life is weird as shit.

2886
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:12,440
And you're telling me that
marijuana should be illegal,

2887
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:13,480
but you,

2888
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,320
you're okay with people
selling oxycontin's yeah.

2889
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,193
Oh Dude,

2890
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,470
you're okay with vicodins.

2891
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:20,810
So much worse stuff is legal with Ambien.

2892
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,860
Ambien is crazy like you're going to get
addicted to something that you need to

2893
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:25,520
sleep,

2894
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,301
and if you don't take it,

2895
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:27,770
you can't sleep and you'll go crazy.

2896
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,101
Oh,

2897
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:28,790
and by the way,

2898
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:32,080
you might wake up while you're on
it and do stuff on our governments.

2899
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:34,370
Find with cigarettes to kill
half a million people a year,

2900
01:19:34,371 --> 01:19:36,800
but their problem with
medicinal marijuana or whatever,

2901
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:38,810
like it's because that's the ultimate one,

2902
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:39,170
right?

2903
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:40,300
Cigarettes are the ultimate one.

2904
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,760
It's the ultimate thing that you never
hear a politician talk about when find me

2905
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:47,990
one guy running for president ever that
has said he wants to take cigarettes out

2906
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:49,460
of the American people's hands.

2907
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,080
Has anyone ever done that?

2908
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,210
You actually have terrorist killed.

2909
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:55,400
Half a million people a
year will be so bummed out.

2910
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,610
People would lose their
shit if you volunteered for
the terrorist organizations

2911
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:02,430
and it killed them.

2912
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,650
You get roped into it.

2913
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:06,050
They didn't even know they got scared.

2914
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:09,240
I got hypnotized and then addicted
and they get brought into terrorist

2915
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:10,380
organization than they murdered him.

2916
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:10,991
Wow.

2917
01:20:10,991 --> 01:20:11,521
That's so sad.

2918
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:12,360
We have to stop this.

2919
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:14,310
Take out the word terrorist,

2920
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:15,840
putting the word cigarette
and that's what you have.

2921
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,900
They hypnotize you with
people looking cool,

2922
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:19,890
you know,

2923
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:21,840
and then you see cool
people that are artists,

2924
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:23,280
man or smoking man.

2925
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,114
It's amazing.

2926
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,410
The next thing you know you're trying it.

2927
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,810
Next thing you know you're
caught in some chemical web.

2928
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,720
We're your actual cells.

2929
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,230
Your tick did don don for real.

2930
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,820
You see people that need it
and they just fucking leave

2931
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,121
dude.

2932
01:20:37,121 --> 01:20:38,350
Like life's a bitch.

2933
01:20:38,351 --> 01:20:42,130
And people got to medicate themselves
against difficult illness called life in

2934
01:20:42,131 --> 01:20:42,964
various ways.

2935
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:45,410
Yeah.

2936
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:49,220
And I think that the idea that anybody's
going to be able to tell you what you

2937
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:50,870
could do is stupid.

2938
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,940
Some people should take care of one.

2939
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,300
I know that's not a popular
thing to say should,

2940
01:20:55,610 --> 01:21:00,610
but I know some people have done some
amazing music with heroin and uh,

2941
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,750
I'm not saying that they should,

2942
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,630
they absolutely had to do
heroin to do that music,

2943
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:06,763
but they did.

2944
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,000
And the music is awesome.

2945
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,410
So it is what it is,

2946
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,190
you know,

2947
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:11,090
it's not for everybody.

2948
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:11,301
Yeah.

2949
01:21:11,301 --> 01:21:12,230
You're dumb to do heroin.

2950
01:21:12,231 --> 01:21:12,351
Yeah.

2951
01:21:12,351 --> 01:21:12,831
That's crazy.

2952
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:13,550
It kills you.

2953
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:15,770
But no liquid fucking.

2954
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,710
We'll look at Devonna did Kurt cobain did,

2955
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,600
one was on heroin and then we use all
these drugs as an excuse to in prison

2956
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:24,620
fucking half the country.

2957
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:26,690
We have five percent of
the world's population.

2958
01:21:26,691 --> 01:21:28,130
Twenty five percent of
the world's prisoners.

2959
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:28,491
Well,

2960
01:21:28,491 --> 01:21:30,020
that's the other thing that privatized,

2961
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,240
privatized private prisons.

2962
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:37,160
And then a prison guard unions that
lobby to make sure that drugs are illegal

2963
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:37,911
and you're like,

2964
01:21:37,911 --> 01:21:38,391
wait a minute,

2965
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:38,721
why?

2966
01:21:38,721 --> 01:21:40,130
It's like they lobby,

2967
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:41,540
make sure make sense.

2968
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:42,883
Harsher,

2969
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:43,813
harsher sentences.

2970
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,310
They lobbied to make
sure that we have work.

2971
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,100
That's what they want to make sure that
they want to make sure that we're out

2972
01:21:49,101 --> 01:21:49,881
there arresting people.

2973
01:21:49,881 --> 01:21:50,661
So we have works,

2974
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:51,630
we have plenty of people to keep.

2975
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:52,350
And,

2976
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:52,700
and,

2977
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,160
and the,

2978
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,640
and the people making money from the
privatized prisons that are lobbying for

2979
01:21:55,641 --> 01:21:57,200
that to fuck.

2980
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,520
It's all our wellbeing.

2981
01:21:58,670 --> 01:21:58,881
I mean,

2982
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:02,720
you add that to the fucking robots
in the sky and the wars over oil.

2983
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:03,441
I mean,

2984
01:22:03,441 --> 01:22:06,290
it's some pretty incredible
stuff that's going on right now.

2985
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,153
Crazy shit.

2986
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:07,670
You know,

2987
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:08,503
freedom.

2988
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:10,700
All this freedom talk.

2989
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:11,091
Meanwhile,

2990
01:22:11,091 --> 01:22:13,280
the NSA's just looking
at all your Dick Pics,

2991
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,500
look at it every email he ever sent,

2992
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:16,334
ever.

2993
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:17,990
I want my guns,

2994
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:18,521
but I don't.

2995
01:22:18,521 --> 01:22:20,580
I don't care if they're fucking
looking at my dick pics.

2996
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:24,650
I wonder what the fuck is going
to happen with this snowden thing.

2997
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,680
They say that he also has some sort of a

2998
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:34,240
like a stash of really super crazy shit
that he will release if anything ever

2999
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,324
happens to him.

3000
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:35,901
And they,

3001
01:22:35,901 --> 01:22:36,260
uh,

3002
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,330
they have like a code for it.

3003
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,770
Like JFK is the code.

3004
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:41,300
You have to break into it.

3005
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,830
You have to break like you have to,

3006
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,510
you have to crack it.

3007
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,460
In the hearings in the UK,

3008
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,770
they said they've only released
one percent of what he is.

3009
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,790
That's the same.

3010
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:51,180
How's that possible?

3011
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:52,320
It's crazy.

3012
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,190
How is that possible?

3013
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:56,220
I don't know how much more crazy shit is.

3014
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,350
Imagine if we found out
that we're not even real.

3015
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,880
They got on a disk somewhere.

3016
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,960
We in the Matrix in the matrix plugged in,

3017
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:05,000
make sure it's 100 percent.

3018
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:05,980
Did you see that

3019
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,150
new stuff about the simulation?

3020
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:08,600
About the Hologram that was on?

3021
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:09,341
Yeah,

3022
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:09,581
yeah,

3023
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:09,941
yeah.

3024
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:10,241
It's,

3025
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:10,510
uh,

3026
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:11,160
I'll pull that up.

3027
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:11,993
It's bizarre.

3028
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,470
The problem with this,

3029
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:14,303
uh,

3030
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,890
the latest evidence that
the universe is a hologram.

3031
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:19,090
The problem with all this stuff,

3032
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,030
is that a headline?

3033
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:23,140
I don't understand it.

3034
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:23,430
No,

3035
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:24,161
I couldn't understand it.

3036
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:25,000
I can understand that.

3037
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:29,320
I've tried to string theory stuff and
this is this the cover of the slate

3038
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:30,130
science page.

3039
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,860
Do we live in a 10 dimensional hologram?

3040
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:33,611
Okay.

3041
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:34,720
I'm just going to shut this off.

3042
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:40,030
Freaking me out the university and
seeing bewildering and times in the past

3043
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:40,031
century,

3044
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:42,400
we've learned an incredible
amount about the cosmos.

3045
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,440
Thirteen point 8 billion year history.

3046
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:48,010
It's structure including the number and
distribution of galaxies in which is

3047
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:48,581
really amazing.

3048
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:50,110
When you stop and think
they figured that out.

3049
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,590
There's more gas in the galaxy.

3050
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:57,430
No more stars than grains of
sand on the beaches of the world.

3051
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:58,860
Jesus crossed.

3052
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,591
Not only that,

3053
01:23:59,591 --> 01:24:03,400
there's a very distinct possibility that
the universe is fractal and infinite.

3054
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,700
One of their ideas is that inside
every galaxy is a black hole,

3055
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:08,470
and inside that black
holes and other universe,

3056
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:10,480
I'm not high enough for this conversation.

3057
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:12,150
It's not high enough.

3058
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:15,200
It's not possible you can't
get high enough because you do,

3059
01:24:15,201 --> 01:24:16,040
you just start talking,

3060
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,830
start talking nonsense,

3061
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,023
but it's a,

3062
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,370
it's a really incredible
thing that they've done,

3063
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:26,640
like trying to study the smallest possible
measured components of nature is that

3064
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,550
as they've gotten deeper
and deeper with this,

3065
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,950
they've shown that the
world is kind of magic.

3066
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:33,181
It's,

3067
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:33,680
it doesn't,

3068
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:38,680
it's not based on any of the laws of
reality that we observe in everyday life.

3069
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:40,840
Like things aren't solid.

3070
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:42,090
They're almost all air.

3071
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:42,230
Yeah.

3072
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,780
You're not actually touching anything.

3073
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:44,450
Touch it.

3074
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:44,680
It's,

3075
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,513
it's the,

3076
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:46,613
uh,

3077
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,790
the vibration,

3078
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:48,940
the forest,

3079
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,890
the charge against is pushing the
electric forest or whatever is.

3080
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:52,421
Yeah,

3081
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:53,171
we're going to butcher it,

3082
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:57,250
but it definitely hardcore go google
that from people who know what they're

3083
01:24:57,251 --> 01:24:57,401
doing.

3084
01:24:57,401 --> 01:24:58,234
Not Comedians,

3085
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:03,700
but like when they talk about quantum
theory and they would talk about article

3086
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:07,840
particles in superposition where they're
moving and then still at the same time.

3087
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:08,561
Oh yeah.

3088
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:10,420
And some of these particles
that are only there,

3089
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:12,160
they're only there when you observe them,

3090
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,660
observe them,

3091
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:14,494
they're not there.

3092
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,360
And that's sort of the,

3093
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:21,070
those are the beginning steps to this
study of the possibility of the universe

3094
01:25:21,071 --> 01:25:23,500
is a Hologram and also simulation theory,

3095
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:27,520
the possibility that what we are in right
now is some indiscernible artificial

3096
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:30,760
reality that we've created in the future
and that we don't realize it because

3097
01:25:30,761 --> 01:25:31,594
it's so good,

3098
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:32,281
it's just,

3099
01:25:32,281 --> 01:25:33,114
it's perfect.

3100
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,640
But we got far enough to create
something which we inevitably will.

3101
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:40,390
That's indiscernible from regular
reality and that's why it seems like some

3102
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,260
piece of fiction,

3103
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:41,650
you know,

3104
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:42,220
that's why,

3105
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:42,580
you know,

3106
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,260
Anthony Wiener showing
pictures of his Dick,

3107
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:46,060
like really obvious shit.

3108
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,010
He thinks get weirder and weirder,

3109
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,580
you know,

3110
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,990
and when these things,

3111
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,510
these weird things happen
over and over and over again,

3112
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:55,240
it's almost like they're letting you know,

3113
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,050
like this is just,

3114
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:56,800
this is a,

3115
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,633
this is a parody.

3116
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,800
We created this,

3117
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,950
this current present from the future.

3118
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:03,710
Yeah,

3119
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:04,491
it's pretty shitty.

3120
01:26:04,491 --> 01:26:05,060
Perfect.

3121
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:05,450
I mean,

3122
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:06,141
genital warts,

3123
01:26:06,141 --> 01:26:06,530
come on,

3124
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:07,280
maybe.

3125
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:07,701
No,

3126
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:08,600
but maybe yes,

3127
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:10,790
because I think there's a
yin and a Yang to everything.

3128
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,850
And if you could just all fuck everybody
willy nilly would no rubber on and not

3129
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:14,684
worry about it,

3130
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,940
then it wouldn't be so pleasurable.

3131
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:21,830
If you could fuck someone who didn't
have herpes or just that's the zen idea

3132
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,660
because experience some pain,

3133
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:25,220
then you've presented
it when it's not there.

3134
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:25,581
Well,

3135
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:29,540
I think there's a Yin and the Yang to the
world just like everything else in the

3136
01:26:29,541 --> 01:26:29,961
universe.

3137
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:33,200
I think there's a reason why we have
evil and it's so that we can appreciate.

3138
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:33,920
Good.

3139
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,131
You know,

3140
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:36,890
I think there is a reason why
we have bad relationships.

3141
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,810
We can appreciate good relationships.

3142
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,880
I really believed that sounds ridiculous,

3143
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:43,970
but I think they only people that ever
learned are people that experienced both

3144
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:44,870
highs and lows,

3145
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:47,240
which is why lottery winners
are almost always fucked.

3146
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:50,270
Which is why people who are
born rich are almost always you.

3147
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,170
Have you seen the charts were people that
become paraplegic and people that win

3148
01:26:54,171 --> 01:26:54,651
the lottery,

3149
01:26:54,651 --> 01:26:57,950
their happiness goes back to
almost exactly after a year.

3150
01:26:57,951 --> 01:26:59,600
It goes back to almost
exactly where they were.

3151
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,260
Wow.

3152
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,190
It's like you don't retain that.

3153
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,040
That immense joy or immense sadness
tends to come back to the mean.

3154
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:07,840
It makes sense.

3155
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,190
We're,

3156
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:09,023
we're adaptable.

3157
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:09,231
I mean,

3158
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:10,970
we'd like to think that we
are what we are right now,

3159
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,833
but you know,

3160
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,770
we are what we are right now is what
we are because of the circumstances we

3161
01:27:15,771 --> 01:27:16,490
exist in.

3162
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,140
If our circumstances existed,

3163
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:19,190
like we were in the Congo,

3164
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,170
digging Colton out of the
mountain with a stick.

3165
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:22,900
That's a reality.

3166
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:23,660
You know,

3167
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,290
you look at,

3168
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:27,230
like a friend of mine wrote
a book about Montezuma.

3169
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,790
I'm Graham Hancock.

3170
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,160
What wrote a book about
a mile that zoom on the,

3171
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:31,521
the,

3172
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:31,611
uh,

3173
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:31,941
the,

3174
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:32,070
the,

3175
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:33,970
the incredible shit the aztecs did,

3176
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:36,570
like really it was a novel and we were,

3177
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:39,380
we were talking about
like living in that time,

3178
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:39,501
like,

3179
01:27:39,501 --> 01:27:39,711
what am,

3180
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:43,700
I would've been like to live in this
crazy barbaric time of human sacrifice.

3181
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:45,320
And that's all they knew.

3182
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,461
That's all they knew.

3183
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:50,300
Just like this is all we know is they're
going to say the same thing about us

3184
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:51,590
and about 10 years.

3185
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,330
What was it like to live
in that barbaric time?

3186
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:55,731
Fox News?

3187
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:57,240
What the fuck was going on there?

3188
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:00,650
People were watching vaginas on the
news while drone bombs were killing

3189
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:03,200
grandmothers see women
to actually think that.

3190
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:04,880
We're just joking around about that.

3191
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:08,020
Like that's not really a big deal to
show your vagina without intelligence.

3192
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:08,630
Not Rude,

3193
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,610
but it really does sway men's opinion.

3194
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,440
Totally fucking really,

3195
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:12,801
really,

3196
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:13,960
really done beyond that.

3197
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:14,640
It's,

3198
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:14,901
it's,

3199
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:15,330
it's,

3200
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:16,820
it's the weirdest thing ever.

3201
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:21,320
Like if you see a girl and even if
you have no shot at or whatsoever,

3202
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:24,020
you even if you don't
want to have sex with her,

3203
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,730
you want her to like you.

3204
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:30,230
If she's super hot and she's wearing
some revealing crazy fox news type girl

3205
01:28:30,231 --> 01:28:31,064
clothing,

3206
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,480
it's hypnosis.

3207
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,520
It's not fair for straight men.

3208
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:35,354
It's not fair.

3209
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:36,270
Especially for dme.

3210
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:37,010
Straight man,

3211
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,410
and that's why so many
dumb people like Fox News,

3212
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,220
those,

3213
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:41,480
those fuckers sirens.

3214
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:42,920
They pull you into the rocks.

3215
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:44,323
Yeah,

3216
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,290
exactly.

3217
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,310
Sirens into the rocks.

3218
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:47,360
I like that fucking.

3219
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,650
I always think it's weird.

3220
01:28:48,651 --> 01:28:49,640
I think we've talked about this before,

3221
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:50,810
that that Fox News,

3222
01:28:50,811 --> 01:28:53,480
it's so cool with certain
things like family guy,

3223
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:55,260
like the cartoon Fox News,

3224
01:28:55,810 --> 01:29:00,680
but the company doesn't match the rest
of the network because it's all Brian.

3225
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:01,860
It's all about making money

3226
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:07,130
and the Fox News with a way to make
money in the news is the really obsessed

3227
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:07,861
people,

3228
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:08,820
conservative people,

3229
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,820
the people that are like really into it
and listening to like conservative talk

3230
01:29:11,821 --> 01:29:12,270
radio,

3231
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:15,450
conservative talk radio
dominates liberal talk radio.

3232
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:17,130
I mean I don't know what
the real numbers were,

3233
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:18,630
but I knew back in the day,

3234
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:20,760
but when Air America came on,

3235
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:25,790
the idea behind Air America was that we
needed a some sort of rebuttal to all

3236
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:27,240
the right wing,

3237
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:27,800
right wing talk,

3238
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,050
rush limbaugh and Michael Savage
type dudes that were everywhere.

3239
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,770
And every time you turn on the radio you'd
have angry white guys screaming about

3240
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:37,140
immigration and all this crazy nonsense.

3241
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:37,830
You know?

3242
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,450
And I think that there's,

3243
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:40,943
there's,

3244
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,420
that's undeniable.

3245
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:43,403
You know,

3246
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:44,483
people are,

3247
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:46,190
we,

3248
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:48,390
we're not looking at it
for what it really is.

3249
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:48,571
Well,

3250
01:29:48,571 --> 01:29:50,740
so you look at where talk radio's biggest,

3251
01:29:50,741 --> 01:29:53,900
it's the middle of the country that's
all red and they're out on farms and they

3252
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,700
got nothing to do.

3253
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,140
Listen to talk radio.

3254
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:56,780
Yeah.

3255
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:57,670
And you know,

3256
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,080
they're also easily led
and if you're really dumb,

3257
01:30:00,081 --> 01:30:00,271
you know,

3258
01:30:00,271 --> 01:30:04,220
if you're feel fearful and
that stuff plays towards fear,

3259
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:05,890
all that right wing stuff,

3260
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,060
whether it's limb by or Michael Savage,

3261
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,660
they're all fearmonger playing towards
fear and that's how they make their

3262
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:12,080
money.

3263
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,790
So Fox News is just,

3264
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,650
that's a great bankable market.

3265
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:16,880
And then on top of that,

3266
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:18,253
if you,

3267
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:18,741
you know,

3268
01:30:18,741 --> 01:30:21,560
you're a guy like Rupert Murdoch who's
like super conservative in the first

3269
01:30:21,561 --> 01:30:21,891
place.

3270
01:30:21,891 --> 01:30:23,180
You want to be able to influence culture.

3271
01:30:23,181 --> 01:30:24,860
You have to influence
culture with the family guy.

3272
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:28,190
It's not going to matter whether or
not your television shows that are just

3273
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,590
strictly entertainment based,

3274
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:30,770
are conservative or liberal.

3275
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:31,790
That doesn't matter.

3276
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:32,031
Right?

3277
01:30:32,031 --> 01:30:35,690
But what really does matter
is these fucking new shows,

3278
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:36,890
the TV shows,

3279
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:38,120
it's just about making some money.

3280
01:30:38,121 --> 01:30:39,080
What's the best way to make money?

3281
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,120
Have people dance with stars.

3282
01:30:41,121 --> 01:30:41,331
I mean,

3283
01:30:41,331 --> 01:30:42,250
it's also about rapid

3284
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:43,580
tish and the fact that they,

3285
01:30:43,581 --> 01:30:43,821
you know,

3286
01:30:43,821 --> 01:30:46,610
if the news says this thing
over and over and over again,

3287
01:30:46,611 --> 01:30:50,360
that's what has the effect on family
guy says one sentence that's not.

3288
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:51,640
Yeah,

3289
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:52,261
just becomes.

3290
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:53,230
So yeah,

3291
01:30:53,231 --> 01:30:53,650
they can,

3292
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:57,790
they can do incredible things by just
repeating things in the news over and over

3293
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:57,941
again.

3294
01:30:57,941 --> 01:30:58,511
And then people say,

3295
01:30:58,511 --> 01:30:59,830
I thought that this was going on.

3296
01:30:59,831 --> 01:31:00,550
You know,

3297
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:02,740
that's God damn.

3298
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,900
But if you just listen
to certain news shows,

3299
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:06,010
you're going to get that slant.

3300
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,120
If you listen to MSNBC,

3301
01:31:07,121 --> 01:31:08,350
you gonna get that left wing slant.

3302
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:09,790
If you listen to CNN,

3303
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:10,950
it used to be a left wing side.

3304
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:11,420
Well,

3305
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:11,730
it's,

3306
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:12,030
you know,

3307
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:14,170
with Msnbc it's interesting
because it is a,

3308
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,660
a kind of left with sand,

3309
01:31:15,661 --> 01:31:17,650
but it's also very much Obama apologist.

3310
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,190
And so if your more left
than Obama like I am,

3311
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,190
then you're like,

3312
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,310
fucking give him a pass on everything.

3313
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,233
It's like,

3314
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:25,690
you know,

3315
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:28,720
NSA surveillance is not okay just
because it's Obama in office.

3316
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:29,913
I wonder what it is,

3317
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:30,240
man.

3318
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,740
I wonder if it's the bill
Hicks choke where you know,

3319
01:31:32,741 --> 01:31:33,690
you get into office,

3320
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,530
they a smoky room filled
with industrialists

3321
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:41,650
and they show you a footage of the
JFK assassination from an ankle.

3322
01:31:41,651 --> 01:31:43,960
No one's ever seen any,

3323
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:44,740
any questions?

3324
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:47,560
Just want to know what my agenda is.

3325
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:50,830
I wonder what happens when you get
in there because I've heard it.

3326
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:51,670
Well,

3327
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:51,940
here's,

3328
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:52,280
here's,

3329
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,730
here's what I would say about it is you
don't get to the point that you could

3330
01:31:55,731 --> 01:31:58,880
get in there unless you've been
approved by the business community.

3331
01:31:58,881 --> 01:31:59,170
I,

3332
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,010
Rick Rubin was

3333
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,010
behind Obama as a senator
maybe even before.

3334
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:03,670
Uh,

3335
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:04,001
I mean,

3336
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:05,230
as for the beastie boys.

3337
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:07,480
So the guy

3338
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,710
with the beard as he was,

3339
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,880
he was behind Obama,

3340
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:13,220
uh,

3341
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:14,350
even as a state senator.

3342
01:32:14,351 --> 01:32:15,970
So basically deep in this politics thing,

3343
01:32:15,971 --> 01:32:20,230
you say names like Rick Rubin that gets
you Brownie points though if you're at a

3344
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:21,000
party.

3345
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,700
Um,

3346
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,301
but he,

3347
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:22,751
you know,

3348
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:23,261
so the.

3349
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:25,630
Okay was already given for Obama as like,

3350
01:32:25,631 --> 01:32:26,830
he's with Wall Street's,

3351
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,693
that kind of thing.

3352
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:30,190
And whereas you see the
people that don't get that,

3353
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:30,461
okay,

3354
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,660
look at Jill Stein or,

3355
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:32,351
or even,

3356
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:32,680
you know,

3357
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,560
Ron Paul had when he
was up for the caucus,

3358
01:32:35,561 --> 01:32:38,070
they're changing numbers and shit and uh,

3359
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:38,501
you know,

3360
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:42,820
Jill Stein was tried to attend the
presidential debate and was arrested and

3361
01:32:42,821 --> 01:32:43,511
locked in a room,

3362
01:32:43,511 --> 01:32:44,344
chained to a charity,

3363
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:48,220
the entirety of the debate in New York
and then released after it was over.

3364
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:48,760
Why?

3365
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,310
What was the reason they said it was
trespassing because he showed up to the

3366
01:32:51,311 --> 01:32:54,720
debates without a ticket and she even.

3367
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,410
She said she's be like four foot five.

3368
01:32:56,411 --> 01:32:57,610
She was like a 60 year old woman.

3369
01:32:57,611 --> 01:32:59,020
And she said to the armed guard,

3370
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,940
how about you two
unchanged from the chairs?

3371
01:33:00,941 --> 01:33:02,020
We're not going to leave the room.

3372
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:02,591
And he said,

3373
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:03,000
no.

3374
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,833
Oh my God,

3375
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,050
that's our democracy.

3376
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:05,571
This is the third.

3377
01:33:05,571 --> 01:33:07,180
This is the Green Party
presidential candidate.

3378
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:11,170
What was also really interesting watching
people scramble when Ron Paul was

3379
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:15,280
doing debates and watching
the way the pundits on TV,

3380
01:33:15,281 --> 01:33:16,750
which is dismissive openly.

3381
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:17,680
And they were.

3382
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,650
There was one time where I believe Ron
Paul was like in third place and someone

3383
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:23,500
else's in fourth place and they were
concentrating on the fourth place person

3384
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:27,130
and they like ignored the fact that we're
on the list was on the screen and they

3385
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:27,581
said one,

3386
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:28,414
two and four.

3387
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:30,010
It's like,

3388
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:31,180
what the fuck man,

3389
01:33:31,181 --> 01:33:35,160
it's so transparent and then he's got a
son now and people are wondering if his

3390
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:36,300
son is,

3391
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,300
I'm going to play ball.

3392
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:40,900
What's going to happen with Rand
Razia chip off the old block.

3393
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:42,970
It's all so weird,

3394
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:43,804
man.

3395
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:48,660
I think that ultimately though with the
trends that are happening right now,

3396
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:53,110
it's like a alternative news sources on
the Internet and people getting to these

3397
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:53,590
places,

3398
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:57,040
the vice type people that are
showing you what was really going on.

3399
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:58,870
This is really where your
cell phones come from.

3400
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:02,640
This is really what kind of a political
uprising is happening in Bahrain.

3401
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:04,690
This is really what's happening in Syria.

3402
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:08,200
This is the reason why the administration
tried to get you to think that we need

3403
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:10,810
to take military action and this is the
reason why they ultimately back down.

3404
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,720
Like the more that stuff comes out,

3405
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,160
it's going to be so hard to fuck around.

3406
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:15,790
Yeah.

3407
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:17,980
It's going to be harder
and harder to control it.

3408
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:19,120
It's going to be so hard to control.

3409
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:22,150
They're not going to be able to know
and it terrifies the fuck out of them,

3410
01:34:22,151 --> 01:34:24,310
which is why they're trying
to control the Internet more.

3411
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:24,791
You know,

3412
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:27,360
they tried to pass those bills
that would kind of shut down the,

3413
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:27,590
you know,

3414
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:30,190
make the Internet less
free and they failed a,

3415
01:34:30,191 --> 01:34:34,170
it was called Sopa and Pipa where the
bills in Congress and people flipped out

3416
01:34:34,171 --> 01:34:39,171
and remember like a Google did a
thing on it and everything and a day.

3417
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:42,850
So it means it's because information is
getting out there and it scares the shit

3418
01:34:42,851 --> 01:34:46,120
out of them and they're trying to
make the internet chained down.

3419
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:46,720
Meanwhile,

3420
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,640
Google just bought Boston dynamics.

3421
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:49,474
Did you see that?

3422
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,730
Scariest shit ever.

3423
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:51,970
Google is skynet.

3424
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:54,100
They just bought this crazy robot company.

3425
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:54,973
Yeah,

3426
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,890
they keep buying crazy shit.

3427
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:58,040
What else did they buy recently?

3428
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,080
What was the other nutty thing
to google bought or they bought.

3429
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:01,010
They bought ways,

3430
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:02,030
which is pretty awesome.

3431
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:02,420
What's that?

3432
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:05,900
That's a program that's using
like a gps that tells you,

3433
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:06,290
you know,

3434
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:11,290
real time traffic because what it's
doing is it's sending out how slow you're

3435
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:12,320
going.

3436
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,310
So people know like,

3437
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:13,461
oh,

3438
01:35:13,461 --> 01:35:15,770
that's streets only
going 30 miles per hour.

3439
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:17,990
But you're getting the
most accurate gps ever.

3440
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:22,580
So pretty much google buy something
that will be able to track you what's

3441
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:23,330
already dragging.

3442
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,020
Yeah,

3443
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:24,790
fact.

3444
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:27,110
I mean anytime anybody's got some sort
of a thing when they're running from the

3445
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:28,220
cops and they have a phone on,

3446
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:29,330
they know exactly what you are.

3447
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:29,480
Yeah.

3448
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,720
But now it won't even have
to be the phone on the car.

3449
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:34,010
We'll be sending out the signal for sure.

3450
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:35,150
I mean I think they already are.

3451
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:35,600
I think,

3452
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:35,870
you know,

3453
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:36,710
when you have like that,

3454
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:37,940
those uh,

3455
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,440
what is that shit called?

3456
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:40,323
Where a uh,

3457
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,553
um,

3458
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,880
what is it when a GM car,

3459
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:44,923
when you press a button?

3460
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:45,411
Onstar.

3461
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:46,010
Onstar.

3462
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:47,810
I have that in my new
car and it scares me.

3463
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:48,610
They find,

3464
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,710
you know,

3465
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,770
you get in a car accident on star goes,

3466
01:35:51,771 --> 01:35:52,604
we're sending a police,

3467
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:53,060
right?

3468
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:53,600
You know,

3469
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,031
I don't,

3470
01:35:54,031 --> 01:35:56,960
I don't ever view myself as the type of
guy that will need to go run and hide in

3471
01:35:56,961 --> 01:35:57,651
a barn somewhere,

3472
01:35:57,651 --> 01:36:02,651
but I would like to have
that on the possibility on
the table as like I could go

3473
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:04,010
hide somewhere and you can't anymore,

3474
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:07,520
but one day when no one can hide,

3475
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:12,440
including bad people will be forced to
reconcile what will be forced to alter

3476
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:16,880
our opinion or alter our behavior
rather to a more evolved state because

3477
01:36:16,881 --> 01:36:18,530
everyone's accountable
for their own behavior.

3478
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:18,891
Well,

3479
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:19,551
the problem is the.

3480
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:24,200
I think the largest bad people in terms
of a structural society sense are not

3481
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:25,190
considered bad people.

3482
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:29,270
I mean the fucking heads of the
government and the corporate assholes,

3483
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,330
but don't you think they're considered
bad people more now than they ever were

3484
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:32,790
before?

3485
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:33,800
Just what we're talking about,

3486
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:37,790
the impact of Operational Wall Street or
the occupy Wall Street movement is that

3487
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:40,580
one of the things it's done
is start the conversation,

3488
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:45,050
be open up the dialogue about
the discrepancy of income
discrepancy of wealth in

3489
01:36:45,051 --> 01:36:48,830
this country and make it
a topic of discussion in a
way that's never really been

3490
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:50,480
fully explored before.

3491
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:52,850
It was just everybody knew they
were rich people and poor people,

3492
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:54,140
but now it's kind of quantified.

3493
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:55,700
Six areas of the Walmart.

3494
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:56,120
Fortunate,

3495
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,380
the same amount of wealth as the bottom.

3496
01:36:57,381 --> 01:36:58,430
Forty percent of America,

3497
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:00,430
$125 million.

3498
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:01,733
They have friends.

3499
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,650
Check this out recently.

3500
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:07,460
Google by a computer vision robot arms.

3501
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:09,260
These are companies and
what they specialize in.

3502
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,820
Robot arm robots,

3503
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:11,990
robot wheels,

3504
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:15,200
robotic cameras and then robotics,

3505
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:19,160
but the the like the last mergers that
they bought like the last eight or most

3506
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:20,710
of them are robot based.

3507
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:24,110
Isn't it ironic that their motto
when they started was don't be evil?

3508
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:24,711
Yeah.

3509
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:26,270
Look at Google's new robot.

3510
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,390
Watch a Time magazine
from December 16th says,

3511
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:31,310
watch Google's new robot run like hell,

3512
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:33,560
this is fucking crazy.

3513
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,790
It is a cheetah.

3514
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:37,220
I mean it literally looks like a Cheetah.

3515
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,360
Wait till you see.

3516
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,500
What does it plan to do with that thing?

3517
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:39,970
Oh,

3518
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:40,803
that's a good question.

3519
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:41,750
But where do you see the,

3520
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:42,130
uh,

3521
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:42,830
the thing run?

3522
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:43,663
It's insane.

3523
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,450
They have one version of it that I don't
think is real at the beginning of it

3524
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:48,303
where it shows it.

3525
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,333
Pull it.

3526
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:49,700
She,

3527
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,533
it.

3528
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,490
Just look for that.

3529
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:52,671
Yeah.

3530
01:37:52,671 --> 01:37:53,090
But go,

3531
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:54,230
go to the very beginning of it.

3532
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,300
Go to the very beginning of before you
click the link and you can see the,

3533
01:37:57,301 --> 01:37:57,630
uh,

3534
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:58,950
the idea of the Cheetah,

3535
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,690
the actual robotic Cheetah.

3536
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:08,030
There's an image when
the thing first starts.

3537
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:08,421
Dude,

3538
01:38:08,421 --> 01:38:10,760
if that thing before you press play,

3539
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:13,140
it's that thing wants to
hump your leg if fucked.

3540
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,030
Yeah.

3541
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:14,421
Look at this.

3542
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:15,254
Prior to that.

3543
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:15,710
Yes.

3544
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:16,543
Look at that.

3545
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:17,720
What the fuck?

3546
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:19,670
It's like a dead mouse.

3547
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:22,220
Back at Dab a little so you can
actually see the full image.

3548
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:24,860
That's insane.

3549
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:26,870
It's a robot fucking cat.

3550
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:28,580
I don't know if that's real though.

3551
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,960
That looks like a,

3552
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:32,360
like an artist's rendering or something
because actually it's a metal sheet

3553
01:38:32,361 --> 01:38:33,080
ahead.

3554
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,340
But when you watch this thing run,

3555
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,780
they can get sued fast.

3556
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:37,621
Like a person,

3557
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:38,880
like a really good sprinter.

3558
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,240
I think they max out and
like the thirties or forties,

3559
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,590
like 30 miles an hour.

3560
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:44,220
It's like,

3561
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:44,431
you know,

3562
01:38:44,431 --> 01:38:47,700
maybe maybe the fastest guys in
the world can get into the forties,

3563
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:49,410
but these fucking things,

3564
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,480
these things could run like cars.

3565
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:52,530
What are they going to do with?

3566
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,000
They're going to chase bad people.

3567
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,680
They're going to make sure
that the streets are safe.

3568
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:58,260
These are a robot.

3569
01:38:58,261 --> 01:38:59,094
Super Friends.

3570
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,513
Look at this thing.

3571
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:04,390
Can you imagine if you're sitting there
on the street ready to cross and you

3572
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:07,890
look left and you look right and you
see this fucking thing running down the

3573
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:10,260
street going 25 miles an hour.

3574
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:12,360
We need to invest in that magnet company,

3575
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:12,871
Asap.

3576
01:39:12,871 --> 01:39:16,200
Rocky a magnet to get
away from these things.

3577
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,060
If we had a shit load of magnets,

3578
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:18,923
magnetic pulse,

3579
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:21,330
just like throwing magnets
everywhere to get out of here.

3580
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,430
They probably thought that through.

3581
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:24,360
Maybe not.

3582
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,850
They're probably using
magnesium because lighter.

3583
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:28,111
Whoa.

3584
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:28,471
What is that?

3585
01:39:28,471 --> 01:39:28,771
Oh,

3586
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:29,604
that's how it stops.

3587
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:32,580
Twenty eight miles an hour.

3588
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:33,680
Actually a person get out,

3589
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:34,230
run that,

3590
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:35,850
but how long I can not run it,

3591
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,080
but like a really fast person.

3592
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:37,914
Can you ride it?

3593
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:39,590
I will take its back.

3594
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,473
Choke it.

3595
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:41,490
Yeah.

3596
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:41,990
That's.

3597
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:45,960
Google owns that now high
and it pisses battery acid.

3598
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:47,250
So sweet.

3599
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,070
I love sweet androids.

3600
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:49,973
Great.

3601
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,053
Yeah.

3602
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:53,880
It's just weird like what are
you going to do with that?

3603
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,470
Why don't you guys make phones?

3604
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:57,640
Like why are you making robot murderer?

3605
01:39:57,650 --> 01:39:58,410
We're going to be that thing.

3606
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:01,260
We're going to be that thing slave and
10 more years we're going to be that

3607
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:01,561
thing.

3608
01:40:01,561 --> 01:40:04,920
In 20 more years I'll get a download your
fucking brain to that and you going to

3609
01:40:04,921 --> 01:40:07,350
run to school and the highway remotely.

3610
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:11,700
You're going to be like at home in your
bed was going to be like a shallow kitty

3611
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:14,610
pool with wires like the
minority report movie.

3612
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:19,170
You're going to be connected
to put on your floaties.

3613
01:40:19,171 --> 01:40:19,740
Yeah.

3614
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:19,991
You can.

3615
01:40:19,991 --> 01:40:23,430
They be connected in this pool with dim
lighting with these electrodes on your

3616
01:40:23,431 --> 01:40:24,330
head and you're just going to be.

3617
01:40:24,331 --> 01:40:27,780
Your consciousness is going to be inside
that Cheetah robot just booking down

3618
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:30,900
the four or five and now the cheater
lots have meetings whether they want to

3619
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:32,280
keep the humans around any longer.

3620
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,720
Eventually I think we're done with them.

3621
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,021
Yeah,

3622
01:40:34,021 --> 01:40:36,660
once somebody gets stung enough to
actually make one of them conscious

3623
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:37,440
themselves,

3624
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,011
the beginning,

3625
01:40:38,011 --> 01:40:40,650
it's going to be just human
consciousness downloaded into a robot,

3626
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:42,360
but then some dummies going to decide,

3627
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:42,860
well,

3628
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:45,330
I want to make my own people
and then that's fucked.

3629
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:46,263
Then we're fucked.

3630
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:47,810
Isn't it funny that like we,

3631
01:40:47,811 --> 01:40:48,120
we,

3632
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,300
we saw like the terminator
and all those movies,

3633
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,491
like,

3634
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:51,271
that's so stupid.

3635
01:40:51,271 --> 01:40:52,104
That's never gonna happen.

3636
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,800
Of course it's going to happen

3637
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,030
and it didn't stop us.

3638
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,680
It's absolutely going to happen.

3639
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:57,641
If you keep going,

3640
01:40:57,641 --> 01:40:58,150
what's,

3641
01:40:58,150 --> 01:40:59,440
what's going to stop it from happening?

3642
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:00,274
How about that?

3643
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:05,500
Can you tell me if people keep going
from here from 2013 with the access to

3644
01:41:05,501 --> 01:41:06,670
technology we have now,

3645
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:08,350
how are you going to
stop 100 years from now?

3646
01:41:08,351 --> 01:41:09,580
There'll be an artificial people.

3647
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:10,990
You're not,

3648
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:11,680
you're not,

3649
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,550
you're not.

3650
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:12,890
You know,

3651
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:13,780
there's no way.

3652
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,380
There's no way they're going to
have that figured out in 100 years.

3653
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:18,250
I mean,

3654
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,330
we might not see it,

3655
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:20,870
but our grandchildren are probably see

3656
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:21,570
and uh,

3657
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:22,403
and it,

3658
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,950
and we're going to look like idiots.

3659
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,090
Chimpanzees,

3660
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:26,953
if they have,

3661
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,470
if artificial intelligence has access
to like all the information ever,

3662
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:33,210
we're going to look
like just fucking moron.

3663
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:34,520
Like these things are dangerous.

3664
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:38,480
They made nuclear power when they
didn't know how to shut the plants off,

3665
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:39,603
just built them.

3666
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:40,790
We just started doing it.

3667
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,013
The reckless.

3668
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:46,070
They have enough bombs to blow up
everything on the planet 10 times over and

3669
01:41:46,071 --> 01:41:47,030
they keep making bombs.

3670
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:48,080
They're crazy.

3671
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:48,261
Now.

3672
01:41:48,261 --> 01:41:49,880
They have bombs and
robots that fly from sky.

3673
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,221
No,

3674
01:41:50,221 --> 01:41:52,280
they don't need to make the university.

3675
01:41:52,281 --> 01:41:53,860
If we got to get rid
of freedom ain't free.

3676
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:56,270
Sudden freedom ain't free.

3677
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,130
Actually,

3678
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:59,780
I had a guy say that to me
in all earnest recently.

3679
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,670
Freedom isn't free.

3680
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:03,770
He had it.

3681
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:04,070
Okay.

3682
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:05,780
It is by nature.

3683
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:07,093
Yes,

3684
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,450
that's exactly what it is.

3685
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:09,360
Freedom.

3686
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:09,590
It's,

3687
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:10,400
it's free.

3688
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,240
It should be free.

3689
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,353
See,

3690
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:14,960
that's just because
like there's oppression.

3691
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:17,750
That doesn't mean the freedom
isn't still a free thing.

3692
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:18,860
Freedom just,

3693
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:19,693
you know,

3694
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:21,283
God damn,

3695
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:23,930
we got to go get the baddies Lee camp.

3696
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:24,883
We do.

3697
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:27,770
Are there any bodies out there or
have we created all the baddies?

3698
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:28,550
What do you think?

3699
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:32,450
Do you think it's 50 percent bodies
that we've created and 50 percent bodies

3700
01:42:32,451 --> 01:42:33,950
that are actually real
that we have to go after?

3701
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:37,070
Or do you think it's
like 100 percent bullshit

3702
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:39,643
at this point?

3703
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:43,850
You know when you've got history
of us propping up military,

3704
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:46,670
military dictatorships and
then go in and invading them?

3705
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,520
Yeah.

3706
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,930
When they're not our friends anymore.

3707
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:50,630
We used to like it,

3708
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:51,464
but now

3709
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,121
hilarious.

3710
01:42:52,121 --> 01:42:53,290
Another great Bill Hicks bit.

3711
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,310
Yeah.

3712
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:55,143
It's just like,

3713
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:58,240
it's so weird that all
this stuff is a fact.

3714
01:42:58,241 --> 01:42:59,410
All this stuff exists.

3715
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,370
You read things like economic hitman.

3716
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:02,310
You find out how we really do,

3717
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:03,590
do run economic,

3718
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:04,930
conventional economic man.

3719
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:06,180
Brilliant book,

3720
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:06,900
the Real,

3721
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,150
the real control of resources
all around the world.

3722
01:43:09,151 --> 01:43:10,410
Like how we get away with it.

3723
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:13,500
And you noticed that one
of my videos recently,

3724
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:14,040
uh,

3725
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:18,040
I did it on how basically they
found out that what they did,

3726
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,020
inventions of economic hit,

3727
01:43:19,021 --> 01:43:19,110
man,

3728
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:19,741
I've worked well.

3729
01:43:19,741 --> 01:43:20,380
You didn't slave,

3730
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:23,250
you'd save countries with a
debt and now they done it.

3731
01:43:23,251 --> 01:43:25,830
The American people with student
loans and mortgages and shit.

3732
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:26,790
So they've been slaved.

3733
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:27,960
The American people with debt.

3734
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:29,640
Well you say that,

3735
01:43:29,641 --> 01:43:33,120
but I say they gave them the
opportunity for a nice car camp.

3736
01:43:33,121 --> 01:43:36,660
There's something about going
to a job in a nice new car.

3737
01:43:36,661 --> 01:43:40,580
And if you just put a
$100 down at $1,500 alone,

3738
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,550
aren't that smart?

3739
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:43,530
A lot of them you say that Lee camp.

3740
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:46,650
But I think that Alexis
can make you feel better,

3741
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:48,103
I think.

3742
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:49,650
I don't think I was arguing at camp.

3743
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,030
I think that having that loan
I was arguing to students,

3744
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:54,590
student loans.

3745
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:57,290
People think they can pay them off
and then they can't for 50 years.

3746
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,011
That's another thing.

3747
01:43:58,011 --> 01:44:02,630
It's like I believe that education should
be available and free to all of our

3748
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:03,021
people.

3749
01:44:03,021 --> 01:44:05,270
I think it should be one of
those things that we encourage.

3750
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,650
We need more smart people,

3751
01:44:06,651 --> 01:44:07,461
more smart people,

3752
01:44:07,461 --> 01:44:09,470
more educated people equals less losers.

3753
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:10,740
That's,

3754
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,840
that's a better society.

3755
01:44:11,841 --> 01:44:13,790
It's a better we will be better off,

3756
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:19,120
but God damn the idea that you go to
school and it costs you a quarter million

3757
01:44:20,481 --> 01:44:22,370
dollars by the time you're
out and you're fucked,

3758
01:44:22,371 --> 01:44:23,420
you're making $50,000

3759
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:27,370
and you and you made that decision at
18 and then your 24 realizing you don't

3760
01:44:27,371 --> 01:44:28,204
want to be a lawyer anymore.

3761
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:29,230
Oh fuck.

3762
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,180
You're fucked.

3763
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:31,710
And it's a shitty feeling to like you.

3764
01:44:31,711 --> 01:44:32,461
You're trapped.

3765
01:44:32,461 --> 01:44:34,140
You're sucked into the web of the system.

3766
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:34,741
I mean,

3767
01:44:34,741 --> 01:44:37,680
I have friends that have student
loans that are just mind boggling.

3768
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:38,731
He talked to them about it.

3769
01:44:38,731 --> 01:44:38,851
Like,

3770
01:44:38,851 --> 01:44:39,750
how are you going to pay it off?

3771
01:44:39,751 --> 01:44:39,871
Like,

3772
01:44:39,871 --> 01:44:40,704
I'm never going to pay it off.

3773
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:41,731
You really know.

3774
01:44:41,731 --> 01:44:43,080
You're never going to pay it up like you,

3775
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:43,491
you have.

3776
01:44:43,491 --> 01:44:43,720
Um,

3777
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:44,010
no.

3778
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:44,843
I said thank God I,

3779
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:45,840
I pay as I went.

3780
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,650
Oh,

3781
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:47,401
it's so crazy.

3782
01:44:47,401 --> 01:44:47,881
Some people,

3783
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:51,770
especially if you do like medical
school or something crazy law school,

3784
01:44:51,790 --> 01:44:52,650
it's very expensive.

3785
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:53,361
The,

3786
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:54,300
the number,

3787
01:44:54,301 --> 01:44:57,720
the actual number you are you're in the
hole for before you even get started in

3788
01:44:57,721 --> 01:44:58,554
the game of life.

3789
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:01,530
And now there's all these fraud schools
that trick people into thinking they're

3790
01:45:01,531 --> 01:45:04,280
going to get some great degree and
it's gotta be a better way than that.

3791
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:06,180
It's gotta be a way to
have education free.

3792
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,280
It seems like the most important thing.

3793
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:09,080
Education,

3794
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:09,913
healthcare,

3795
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:10,823
police,

3796
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:11,641
the Internet,

3797
01:45:11,641 --> 01:45:13,020
pretty much the newest education.

3798
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:15,240
If you could focus and
make sure you're like,

3799
01:45:15,241 --> 01:45:19,500
just sit there and try to learn different
techniques on like youtube and beyonce

3800
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:21,460
and that's just now I think the,

3801
01:45:21,461 --> 01:45:21,571
uh,

3802
01:45:21,571 --> 01:45:22,440
the real internet.

3803
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:24,540
I was listening to this podcast,

3804
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:28,530
I forgot that I think it's radio lab
until radio lab or something like that.

3805
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:33,660
And they were talking about human neural
interfaces and that the ultimate goal

3806
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:36,510
is what they're working
on right now is there.

3807
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:42,290
We have already the ability
to take a phone and answer,

3808
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:44,460
ask a question to the phone,

3809
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:47,250
speak right into it and give you
an answer in a couple of seconds.

3810
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:48,490
But there's going to,

3811
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:50,580
they're going to have within a decade,

3812
01:45:50,581 --> 01:45:51,270
two decades,

3813
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:52,830
there's going to be one less step.

3814
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:54,330
You just going to have that information,

3815
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,100
you just think you're going to get it,

3816
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:58,360
it's going to be there and you know,

3817
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:01,170
it might actually even come
in a form of knowledge,

3818
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,060
like it won't be a written
word that you have to read,

3819
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:04,680
like it'll come in a formal,

3820
01:46:04,681 --> 01:46:07,890
there'll be able to break down what our
parcels of knowledge and information

3821
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,500
because they've already figured out
that they can plant information,

3822
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:12,080
they could plant information to brand,

3823
01:46:12,081 --> 01:46:13,410
they could plant false memories.

3824
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:15,120
So if they can plant false memories,

3825
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:16,530
that's another scary thing.

3826
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:17,970
If once you take those memories,

3827
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:21,060
you have control of everything
before you go to a place like that.

3828
01:46:21,061 --> 01:46:23,220
Fucking what was that
Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?

3829
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:23,940
Total recall.

3830
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:24,390
Recall,

3831
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:27,540
they hook you up with some machine
and you just live like a baller.

3832
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,010
That's the matrix.

3833
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:31,800
That's the real,

3834
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:32,790
the real hologram.

3835
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:38,150
But like they have those been the Pentagon
has spent millions and millions on

3836
01:46:38,151 --> 01:46:40,170
pills that help erase memories is for,

3837
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:40,630
uh,

3838
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:41,810
for soldiers and things.

3839
01:46:41,950 --> 01:46:42,071
Well,

3840
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:44,470
they've also tried a lot of
shit that didn't work like LSD,

3841
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,720
lsd initially.

3842
01:46:46,721 --> 01:46:50,070
The idea was that it would be a
truth serum that would capture the

3843
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,401
enemy,

3844
01:46:50,401 --> 01:46:51,330
give them Lsd,

3845
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:52,680
and they would be forced
to tell the truth.

3846
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,100
Right?

3847
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,620
Not so much especially.

3848
01:46:55,621 --> 01:46:58,260
They didn't even understand
the dosage was fun serum.

3849
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:00,650
They were giving people
every on bottles were acid,

3850
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:06,420
drink this and tell us the truth and
they would lose their fucking marbles and

3851
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:06,871
then they said,

3852
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:07,201
okay,

3853
01:47:07,201 --> 01:47:07,471
okay,

3854
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:07,801
okay,

3855
01:47:07,801 --> 01:47:08,670
this doesn't work for that,

3856
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:10,050
but maybe it'll work for this.

3857
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,240
It's probably like one guy who really
loved acid and he wanted just to continue

3858
01:47:13,241 --> 01:47:14,074
that research.

3859
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:15,263
They said,

3860
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:17,970
how about we do this when
our guys get captured,

3861
01:47:17,971 --> 01:47:18,691
they'll take acid.

3862
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:20,820
That way they won't be able
to divulge any secrets.

3863
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:22,040
So that was doing that.

3864
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:26,850
Those are the two options and then
somewhere around the late 19 sixties they

3865
01:47:26,851 --> 01:47:30,120
realized they had a problem because acid
really permeated the entire culture and

3866
01:47:30,121 --> 01:47:33,270
start changing the way people were
thinking about opening minds and so many

3867
01:47:33,271 --> 01:47:37,590
people that Timothy leary fans were
tuning in and dropping out and they were.

3868
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:40,330
People are getting to a
point where that was a,

3869
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:40,920
uh,

3870
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,540
there was ways to think there was,

3871
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:43,560
you could be a Republican,

3872
01:47:43,561 --> 01:47:44,640
you can be a Democrat,

3873
01:47:44,641 --> 01:47:47,670
you could be a humanitarian or you
could be a psychedelic adventure.

3874
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,350
All of the sudden that's an option too.

3875
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:49,740
Right.

3876
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:51,330
And then people were diving
into that and they were like,

3877
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:51,481
well,

3878
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:56,130
these people have really good arguments
and they obviously are impossible to,

3879
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:56,671
to mind.

3880
01:47:56,671 --> 01:47:57,000
Fuck.

3881
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,860
And all of a sudden they're
against the Vietnam war.

3882
01:47:58,920 --> 01:47:59,753
They're against everything.

3883
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:00,190
Yeah.

3884
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:00,660
They,

3885
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:00,931
you know,

3886
01:48:00,931 --> 01:48:01,920
like the weather underground.

3887
01:48:01,921 --> 01:48:05,100
They wanted to have orgies and
fucking blow up the government.

3888
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:05,641
Yeah.

3889
01:48:05,641 --> 01:48:06,350
It's,

3890
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:10,200
you get a lot of weirdness when you
start throwing an acid into the mix.

3891
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,750
So they're like around 1979.

3892
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:12,330
All right,

3893
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,620
let's just make all this shit illegal.

3894
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,900
It's hard to believe that up until 1970,

3895
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:17,100
everything was legal.

3896
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:19,830
Marijuana was illegal
since the 19 thirties.

3897
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:21,150
But besides the marijuana,

3898
01:48:21,151 --> 01:48:22,080
like mushrooms,

3899
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:22,800
Peyote,

3900
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,281
mushrooms,

3901
01:48:23,281 --> 01:48:23,550
uh,

3902
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:24,420
cocaine,

3903
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,850
all that shit was legal until 1970.

3904
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,051
That's weird.

3905
01:48:28,051 --> 01:48:28,620
Huh?

3906
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:29,453
Maybe not cocaine.

3907
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:30,121
I know.

3908
01:48:30,121 --> 01:48:31,470
Definitely a psychedelics,

3909
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:35,190
that's what they're going to say
about like Salvia cigarettes.

3910
01:48:35,191 --> 01:48:37,020
Alcohol and 20 years from now,

3911
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,093
10 years,

3912
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:38,401
well,

3913
01:48:38,401 --> 01:48:40,440
they've already done it with
Salvia and a lot of places,

3914
01:48:40,441 --> 01:48:41,820
but I don't think they're
going to say with cigarettes,

3915
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:44,190
thank God they make a lot of money from
alcohol because they're not getting rid

3916
01:48:44,191 --> 01:48:44,401
of that.

3917
01:48:44,401 --> 01:48:45,360
As long as they make money.

3918
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:45,690
Yeah,

3919
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:46,530
we need something.

3920
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:47,550
You can't do that.

3921
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:49,050
We're going to be
reprogrammed to beat drunk.

3922
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:50,100
Like I want to be drunk right now.

3923
01:48:50,110 --> 01:48:50,550
Dink.

3924
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:53,940
And then you know like it's gonna fuck
with your brain so your brain thinks

3925
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:54,520
you're drunk.

3926
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,390
It's going to be like an on off switch
and we're going to start programming.

3927
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,940
What I think they're going to do
is have like a Jack Daniels Patch.

3928
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,460
Slap it on your stomach and
you don't have to drink.

3929
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:03,390
You don't get shitty breath.

3930
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:04,650
You just put a patch on your stomach.

3931
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:06,090
It's so much less cool at bars,

3932
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:09,960
solely not quoted on your
stomach a little bit.

3933
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:12,690
Someone's trying to find out
what the actual drugs were.

3934
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:13,261
Hey Baby,

3935
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:14,640
you want to hang out and put patches on.

3936
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:20,050
You see that Kanye west a remake
video that a seth rogen did and that,

3937
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:21,811
that other guys,

3938
01:49:21,811 --> 01:49:22,300
for instance.

3939
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:22,770
No,

3940
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:23,670
I heard it was really funny though.

3941
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:23,911
Yeah.

3942
01:49:23,911 --> 01:49:24,810
Cocaine was one.

3943
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:27,480
Cocaine was illegal until 1970.

3944
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:28,170
You mean legal?

3945
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:28,930
Legal rather?

3946
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:30,330
Until 1970.

3947
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:30,931
Oh yeah.

3948
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:31,764
Freud was picking the.

3949
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:33,000
Morphine was legal.

3950
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,320
Codene was legal.

3951
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:35,453
Yeah.

3952
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:37,590
Remember how you used to be
able to get cody with Nyquil?

3953
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:38,580
Right.

3954
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:39,301
Oh my God.

3955
01:49:39,301 --> 01:49:42,060
I was sick once and I took some Nyquil
and I've never felt better in my whole

3956
01:49:42,061 --> 01:49:42,894
life.

3957
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:44,100
It was beautiful.

3958
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:44,671
It was a,

3959
01:49:44,671 --> 01:49:46,860
it was like a total
psychedelic experience.

3960
01:49:46,861 --> 01:49:48,160
I don't know if I took too much

3961
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,910
or what,

3962
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:53,800
but I remember the seven
maybe [inaudible] 98,

3963
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:56,440
somewhere in the nineties
when it was still available.

3964
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,020
I know do it a stand up comedian that's
addicted to this stuff and he used to

3965
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,230
work in clubs.

3966
01:50:01,231 --> 01:50:04,720
It's like in the eighties and nineties
and the club owner would have to go out,

3967
01:50:04,721 --> 01:50:06,370
like send a manager out to pick them up,

3968
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:08,740
nyquil bottles of Nyquil,

3969
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:11,590
and then he would go back to his
hotel room and get fucked up.

3970
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:12,970
Yeah.

3971
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:15,040
The dude was just a
straight up nyquil junkie.

3972
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,263
I never heard.

3973
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:20,650
I never had anything like that and was
working at rascals in New Jersey and they

3974
01:50:20,651 --> 01:50:22,630
were telling me the story
about this dude and I'm like,

3975
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:23,464
how many bottles?

3976
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:24,370
Like he'll go through three,

3977
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:25,203
four bottles a night.

3978
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:27,070
Yeah.

3979
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:31,870
We used to do that and then no dose if
we want at a high piles of Nodoz and just

3980
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,180
take it at the same time.

3981
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:33,370
Like,

3982
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:33,730
no,

3983
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:34,070
no,

3984
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:34,221
no,

3985
01:50:34,221 --> 01:50:34,570
no,

3986
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:34,751
no,

3987
01:50:34,751 --> 01:50:34,960
no.

3988
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,870
Like if we went to either a
higher low nodoz or road trip,

3989
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:39,210
confused the fuck out of your brain,

3990
01:50:39,211 --> 01:50:40,044
son.

3991
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:40,601
Yeah.

3992
01:50:40,601 --> 01:50:41,650
You can't be mixing it up.

3993
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:42,940
That's a speed ball for retards.

3994
01:50:42,941 --> 01:50:43,774
Yep.

3995
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:44,853
Take both of them.

3996
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,690
But cody was delicious.

3997
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:47,861
It was so good.

3998
01:50:47,861 --> 01:50:50,740
Like how it made you feel like
I was melting into my bed.

3999
01:50:50,741 --> 01:50:51,850
I was like so happy.

4000
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:55,300
I was so like I felt so warm and
comfortable and I was sick as shit.

4001
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:57,310
It was this back before
you're doing anything?

4002
01:50:57,790 --> 01:50:58,360
Drugs?

4003
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:58,670
Yeah.

4004
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:00,810
You wouldn't see what
you were just on coding.

4005
01:51:00,811 --> 01:51:01,350
Nyquil?

4006
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:02,290
I just did it once.

4007
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:04,570
I mean literally only
took this stuff once.

4008
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:05,530
Is that John Mayer?

4009
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:05,950
No,

4010
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:08,530
it's a James Franco.

4011
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,900
James Franco and Kanye western music.

4012
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:11,760
No,

4013
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:11,881
no,

4014
01:51:11,881 --> 01:51:12,011
no,

4015
01:51:12,011 --> 01:51:12,280
no.

4016
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,770
The one on one.

4017
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:15,580
One on the right is a parody.

4018
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:16,270
Yeah.

4019
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:19,150
Because it was such a ridiculous video
that Connie is like pretty much having

4020
01:51:19,151 --> 01:51:19,960
sex with,

4021
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:20,130
uh,

4022
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:22,270
what's her dashing on his motorcycle.

4023
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:27,390
So they did a shot by shot remake of
it with Seth Rogen as Kardashians.

4024
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:29,290
So bad though.

4025
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:30,543
Like

4026
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,340
this fucking the lyrics are so bad.

4027
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:35,620
Yeah.

4028
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:38,470
They just such dumb nonsense,

4029
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:41,320
overinflated ego nonsense.

4030
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,180
Did you see him on.

4031
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,680
They brought it back on South Park.

4032
01:51:44,681 --> 01:51:47,650
I'm the last one was the gay fish one
and they brought him back this time.

4033
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,130
A hobby?

4034
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:49,910
Yeah,

4035
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:50,860
as Kardashians.

4036
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:51,680
The hobbit.

4037
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:52,211
And she's like,

4038
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:52,480
ma'am,

4039
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:52,651
I have.

4040
01:51:52,651 --> 01:51:53,484
It's not a hobby,

4041
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:54,363
but it's a.

4042
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:55,880
am I crazy or did Connie?

4043
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,470
She used to be a rational human being.

4044
01:51:57,471 --> 01:52:00,730
Like he just wasn't famous
enough for them to really bloom.

4045
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:02,260
Shot this terrible piece of shit.

4046
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:03,270
It's pretty funny.

4047
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:04,150
They start making out.

4048
01:52:04,410 --> 01:52:06,350
It's not good enough
to just to have enough.

4049
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,400
It's not good enough to stop it.

4050
01:52:09,401 --> 01:52:10,234
Shut it off.

4051
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:11,503
No,

4052
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:13,900
I get it guys.

4053
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:14,800
Just so bad.

4054
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,633
I don't get it.

4055
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:17,260
It'd be someone tried
to explain to me the,

4056
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:17,421
Oh,

4057
01:52:17,421 --> 01:52:18,580
this is another thing that's really cute.

4058
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:20,980
I'm liberals really left wing.

4059
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:23,620
People have taken to defending Kanye,

4060
01:52:23,621 --> 01:52:24,790
saying that he's a genius.

4061
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:27,400
The white guilt comes out in full blast.

4062
01:52:27,401 --> 01:52:28,030
Yes,

4063
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:28,750
I've read.

4064
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:29,860
Actually I've read.

4065
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,550
So they,

4066
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:32,980
they loved him for that
moment where he said,

4067
01:52:32,981 --> 01:52:34,900
Bush hates black people after Katrina.

4068
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:35,261
Well,

4069
01:52:35,261 --> 01:52:36,670
if you want some street cred,

4070
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:37,271
you know,

4071
01:52:37,271 --> 01:52:37,720
you uh,

4072
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:40,870
you talk about how Kanye west is a genius.

4073
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:42,160
He's a misunderstood genius.

4074
01:52:42,161 --> 01:52:43,160
And like all genie sissies.

4075
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:44,311
What do you,

4076
01:52:44,311 --> 01:52:45,380
he misunderstood genius.

4077
01:52:45,381 --> 01:52:46,430
How many records you sell?

4078
01:52:46,431 --> 01:52:46,700
He's,

4079
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,400
he's an understood genius apparently.

4080
01:52:48,401 --> 01:52:48,960
Yeah.

4081
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:49,791
Well understood.

4082
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:50,820
And the fact he's criticized.

4083
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:52,880
The reason why he says such things,

4084
01:52:52,881 --> 01:52:53,840
it's because he's a genius.

4085
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:55,400
Geniuses are unhinged.

4086
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,950
But the problem is the music's terrible.

4087
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:59,300
So that evidence doesn't hold up.

4088
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:00,740
Why is it sell so much?

4089
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,310
The same reason why the recent Gallup
poll said the 46 percent of the people

4090
01:53:04,311 --> 01:53:06,110
thought the earth is less
than 10,000 years old.

4091
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:06,890
Okay.

4092
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:08,410
We're overwhelmed by retards.

4093
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:08,810
We're,

4094
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:09,700
we're swimming up.

4095
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:09,980
Yup.

4096
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:10,640
And whatever.

4097
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:12,200
Whatever shit is put on the radio,

4098
01:53:12,201 --> 01:53:13,850
the most will sell the most.

4099
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,890
So whatever record companies with,

4100
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:18,620
it's getting to put it on
the radio every 10 seconds.

4101
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:19,431
Not only that,

4102
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:22,700
now that he's locked up
with Kim Kardashian and he's
involved in this fucking

4103
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:23,800
weird sort of a,

4104
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:24,471
you know,

4105
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:25,640
a reality.

4106
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:26,231
Yeah.

4107
01:53:26,231 --> 01:53:27,890
It's like a metal reality.

4108
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:28,270
Yeah.

4109
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:28,731
It's this,

4110
01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:29,010
this,

4111
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:29,680
this,

4112
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:34,210
this weird meme at this internet thing
where everybody's talking about and it's

4113
01:53:34,211 --> 01:53:35,290
constantly keeps up.

4114
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:35,840
I mean,

4115
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,450
that baby is born an
actor like that is a role.

4116
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:42,230
That is a role that babies
playing other poor kid.

4117
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:43,720
Oh,

4118
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:45,490
just grow up like that
in front of the camera.

4119
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,690
Completely confused.

4120
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:48,190
Why are the cameras by me?

4121
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:49,210
I went to Bobby's house.

4122
01:53:49,211 --> 01:53:50,044
There's no cameras.

4123
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:50,923
Shut up.

4124
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:52,800
You have to get fixed.

4125
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:53,690
And what's it named?

4126
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:56,390
Siberius Lord of the jungle.

4127
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,890
What's not on something?

4128
01:53:57,950 --> 01:53:59,150
I'm just wondering what they named it.

4129
01:53:59,330 --> 01:53:59,601
Oh,

4130
01:53:59,601 --> 01:54:00,530
northwest,

4131
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:01,423
of course.

4132
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:01,880
You know,

4133
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:02,540
poor kid.

4134
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:03,110
What are you to do?

4135
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:04,040
Hopefully they'll wake up.

4136
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:06,620
Hopefully somebody will give
us a mushrooms and they'll go,

4137
01:54:06,621 --> 01:54:07,460
oh my God,

4138
01:54:07,461 --> 01:54:08,294
what am I doing?

4139
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:10,310
What have I been doing?

4140
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:11,151
Who am I?

4141
01:54:11,151 --> 01:54:12,080
I'm sorry.

4142
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:12,950
I'm sorry.

4143
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:16,691
Beyonce.

4144
01:54:16,691 --> 01:54:17,111
His new album.

4145
01:54:17,111 --> 01:54:17,440
It's high.

4146
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:17,981
Who gives a fuck?

4147
01:54:17,981 --> 01:54:18,310
Dude,

4148
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:19,143
I don't care.

4149
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,320
So it's nonsense.

4150
01:54:20,321 --> 01:54:21,220
Pop Music Talk.

4151
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:22,680
Have you heard the New York?

4152
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:22,960
No,

4153
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:23,550
I'm not going to.

4154
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:25,050
It's Shit's pretty much slapped.

4155
01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:25,480
I don't want to.

4156
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:27,480
Might Cherry Song.

4157
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:28,450
Got Squirting.

4158
01:54:28,451 --> 01:54:29,160
Find it.

4159
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:29,760
What?

4160
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:29,950
Yeah,

4161
01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:32,110
it's ship or something please.

4162
01:54:32,410 --> 01:54:33,210
It's hot.

4163
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:33,880
It's not hot.

4164
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:34,710
It's dumb.

4165
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:37,520
It's dumb music because
I don't like that mood,

4166
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:39,390
but you don't listen to music.

4167
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:40,390
Like what kind of Shitty music?

4168
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:42,120
What does that one pop band that you like?

4169
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:42,820
One direction or.

4170
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:43,481
Not one direction,

4171
01:54:43,481 --> 01:54:45,460
but it was something.

4172
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,910
It was all shit.

4173
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:48,880
Are you talking about Brian?

4174
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:51,550
There was something recently that
you said that you really liked.

4175
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:52,930
I can't remember what it was,

4176
01:54:52,931 --> 01:54:53,780
but it was some kind of.

4177
01:54:53,830 --> 01:54:54,661
But you got to remember it.

4178
01:54:54,661 --> 01:54:55,990
If you've got to bring
it up in a conversation.

4179
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:57,640
I failed at that,

4180
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:58,750
but I'll try to remember.

4181
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:04,570
I don't want to be talking
about music or actual vapid.

4182
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:05,950
It's so incredibly vapid.

4183
01:55:05,951 --> 01:55:06,251
I mean,

4184
01:55:06,251 --> 01:55:07,940
I just did a show with a great bangle,

4185
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:11,560
rooftop revolutionaries because they say
something and God forbid a band should

4186
01:55:11,561 --> 01:55:12,394
say something.

4187
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:13,691
Well,

4188
01:55:13,691 --> 01:55:17,530
you know the problem with people saying
something if I already know what they're

4189
01:55:17,531 --> 01:55:17,801
saying,

4190
01:55:17,801 --> 01:55:18,730
I get it.

4191
01:55:18,910 --> 01:55:19,241
You know,

4192
01:55:19,241 --> 01:55:20,050
you're saying something.

4193
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:20,770
I already know it.

4194
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:21,940
Why did you say Miley Cyrus?

4195
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:24,070
Because you were talking about
how much you like Miley Cyrus.

4196
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:25,810
I said she's got a great voice.

4197
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:26,830
She,

4198
01:55:26,830 --> 01:55:27,370
she,

4199
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:29,710
when she was singing that
Dolly Parton Song joely.

4200
01:55:29,770 --> 01:55:30,051
So you,

4201
01:55:30,051 --> 01:55:31,780
do you think Miley's better than beyonce?

4202
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:35,140
As far as like the way
she's saying in that song?

4203
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:35,831
Absolutely.

4204
01:55:35,831 --> 01:55:36,664
Okay.

4205
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:37,653
What do you okay in?

4206
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:37,960
No,

4207
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:38,610
that's an interesting.

4208
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:39,760
I was an interesting.

4209
01:55:39,761 --> 01:55:41,830
I never thought that beyonce would.

4210
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:43,770
I never thought my would
better than beyonce.

4211
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:44,100
I

4212
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:44,611
like Miley,

4213
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:46,380
but I don't think he's terrible

4214
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:49,220
dog shit song that she said at the
American music awards or video awards or

4215
01:55:49,221 --> 01:55:49,750
whatever it was.

4216
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:50,840
We got all the controversy.

4217
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:51,231
Yeah,

4218
01:55:51,231 --> 01:55:52,064
that was terrible.

4219
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:54,230
But that one video that
she did what she did,

4220
01:55:54,231 --> 01:55:55,160
the Dolly Parton thing.

4221
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:56,780
She's got a fucking hell of a voice,

4222
01:55:56,781 --> 01:55:57,290
man,

4223
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:57,531
you know,

4224
01:55:57,531 --> 01:55:58,640
and I guess beyonce does too,

4225
01:55:58,641 --> 01:55:59,870
but I don't like that music.

4226
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:01,233
You know,

4227
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:03,430
you should check out the
new one it sounds like too,

4228
01:56:03,431 --> 01:56:04,120
but thanks.

4229
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:04,860
What's that girl?

4230
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:06,130
That life is short.

4231
01:56:06,131 --> 01:56:10,300
Joey ideas likes diet and Diana Ross or
that one's sexy girl from the seventies.

4232
01:56:10,301 --> 01:56:11,920
That sounds like that kind of music now.

4233
01:56:11,921 --> 01:56:13,360
Like she's very sexy,

4234
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:15,880
very seventies kind of a cool album.

4235
01:56:15,881 --> 01:56:16,714
I think you would like man.

4236
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:17,860
Diana Ross.

4237
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:18,130
I didn't.

4238
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:18,700
Okay.

4239
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:19,530
Did you see this thing

4240
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:24,120
about Fdr has been going on the Internet
lately that FDR grew up in a dress?

4241
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:25,050
Yeah.

4242
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:30,000
How does that then apparently it was
like normal back then for kids to what?

4243
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:30,550
What,

4244
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:31,680
what are you saying that?

4245
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:32,340
Yeah,

4246
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:33,120
I was just agreeing with you.

4247
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:33,450
Yeah.

4248
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:36,050
It was normal for people
to wear dresses like per,

4249
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,000
for people to really.

4250
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,620
People are just fucking their children.

4251
01:56:40,621 --> 01:56:44,340
They would have their sons and dresses
like they weren't so rigid about their

4252
01:56:44,341 --> 01:56:45,600
gender roles back then.

4253
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:46,890
Yeah.

4254
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:49,500
Actually photos are and address.

4255
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:51,203
Yeah,

4256
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,440
I mean somewhat google,

4257
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,790
Google debunked.

4258
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,720
Okay.

4259
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:57,540
FDR and address debunked
because maybe it was a joke

4260
01:56:59,270 --> 01:57:00,103
and we're being.

4261
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:00,500
Well,

4262
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,250
I know back then it used to be cute
for it didn't matter if it was a boy or

4263
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:03,441
girl.

4264
01:57:03,441 --> 01:57:05,530
You dressed them up in a dress because
it was cute because our babies.

4265
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:06,950
I don't know about that man.

4266
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,420
Nope.

4267
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:12,253
Nope.

4268
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:13,340
You can't debunk it.

4269
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,050
FDR dropping address.

4270
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:16,100
Wow.

4271
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:19,700
This is the article that I tweeted from
the Atlantic and said it was wasn't

4272
01:57:19,701 --> 01:57:21,920
always blue for boys and pink for girls.

4273
01:57:22,330 --> 01:57:23,690
It's fucking really strange.

4274
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:24,651
You don't think about it,

4275
01:57:24,651 --> 01:57:25,400
but that was.

4276
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:27,290
That was like not that long ago

4277
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:32,860
and people apparently on a regular basis
just to kids up like the crest jesser

4278
01:57:33,070 --> 01:57:34,900
boys up like girls and nobody
thought anything of it.

4279
01:57:37,190 --> 01:57:38,300
The new deals mastermind.

4280
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:41,450
Unexpected childhood look as a reminder
that our culture norms about gender

4281
01:57:41,451 --> 01:57:44,390
specific clothing for children
are surprisingly recent.

4282
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:46,820
Historically historical development,

4283
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:47,933
Huh?

4284
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:49,220
It's kind of weird.

4285
01:57:49,250 --> 01:57:49,790
You know,

4286
01:57:49,790 --> 01:57:53,100
it is weird that we decide like the ladies
on Fox News are allowed to wear these

4287
01:57:53,110 --> 01:57:55,880
skirts and loud to have
these legs exposed,

4288
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:56,690
but men are not.

4289
01:57:56,690 --> 01:57:58,610
We have to wear our silly close,

4290
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:01,970
but if we were in Africa
were Maasai Warriors,

4291
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:02,960
we'd have to dress differently.

4292
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:03,950
You know,

4293
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:07,460
we just accept the societal paradigm.

4294
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:08,480
Yeah,

4295
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:09,650
we accept some weird shit.

4296
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:11,270
Why can't FDR being addressed?

4297
01:58:11,271 --> 01:58:12,104
Brian?

4298
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:13,663
I think it's cute.

4299
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:14,380
He does.

4300
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,213
It's very cute.

4301
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:17,890
I think I was trying to find
more pictures of it because uh,

4302
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:22,190
actually I think my mom told me that a
long time ago and I didn't believe her.

4303
01:58:22,191 --> 01:58:25,940
And then I found out that there's like
a lot of old pictures and paintings and

4304
01:58:25,941 --> 01:58:28,550
boys in dresses and I
started collecting them.

4305
01:58:28,610 --> 01:58:29,630
How do you know it's a boy though?

4306
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:33,190
Could just be really looking at this one.

4307
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,640
I know boys in dresses.

4308
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:37,420
Um,

4309
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:38,171
are you looking at your phone?

4310
01:58:38,171 --> 01:58:39,004
Dude,

4311
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:40,020
we can check it out of this.

4312
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:40,690
No,

4313
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:41,150
I was,

4314
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:42,250
I was looking at tweets

4315
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,083
about the show.

4316
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:44,133
You can't do that.

4317
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:44,930
All right.

4318
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:45,850
Do it while it's happening.

4319
01:58:45,851 --> 01:58:47,120
They'll suck you in our religion.

4320
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:47,840
You'll never escape.

4321
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,610
Okay.

4322
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:49,360
I didn't know that rule.

4323
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,460
And then they'll ask you
questions and then you respond to,

4324
01:58:51,461 --> 01:58:52,510
you guys all got your computers.

4325
01:58:52,511 --> 01:58:53,344
I feel left out.

4326
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:53,620
Well,

4327
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:56,750
it's just because we were given each
tried to talk about that's how we met

4328
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,980
because there's certain things
that are going on in the news

4329
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:00,010
thought were fascinating.

4330
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:02,650
I knew I was going to
bring up so I had to.

4331
01:59:02,651 --> 01:59:03,484
Well,

4332
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:04,600
I'm,

4333
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:06,430
one of the things I
wanted to talk about was,

4334
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:06,970
um,

4335
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:07,211
the,

4336
01:59:07,211 --> 01:59:12,040
the FDA is actually saying
now the antibacterial soaps
may not curve bacteria.

4337
01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:15,550
They're also saying that like washing
your hands in hot water doesn't do a

4338
01:59:15,551 --> 01:59:17,400
goddamn thing and that it's just,

4339
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:22,180
it's soap that kills bacteria and that
antibacterial soap is actually bad for

4340
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:22,960
you.

4341
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:23,510
And.

4342
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:25,640
But the Purell Shit

4343
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,520
does kill like all the bags.

4344
01:59:27,530 --> 01:59:28,940
That's not antibacterial soap.

4345
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:29,211
Right,

4346
01:59:29,211 --> 01:59:29,451
right.

4347
01:59:29,451 --> 01:59:30,380
That's just poisoned.

4348
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:30,770
Right.

4349
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:31,310
Right.

4350
01:59:31,310 --> 01:59:34,130
But it's also making it so that we don't
have any defense mechanisms anymore.

4351
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:34,731
Well,

4352
01:59:34,731 --> 01:59:37,700
it is on your hands if you're one
of those Howie Mendell type dudes,

4353
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:39,090
that shit in your hand every day.

4354
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:39,380
Yeah.

4355
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:40,310
Some people do that.

4356
01:59:40,311 --> 01:59:41,420
They get obsessed with it.

4357
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:43,400
Being blue should shut
that heater off man,

4358
01:59:43,401 --> 01:59:43,910
because it's,

4359
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:45,990
it's about 150,000
fucking degrees in here.

4360
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:49,033
It's great.

4361
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:50,850
Soon we'll have really.

4362
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:52,913
Um,

4363
01:59:54,230 --> 01:59:54,800
but uh,

4364
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,740
what they're saying is that we were
using it way too much and that,

4365
01:59:57,741 --> 01:59:57,920
uh,

4366
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:01,430
people that are doing that or they're
killing their natural skin flora and uh,

4367
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:02,010
that it's,

4368
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:03,920
it's not preventing us from getting sick.

4369
02:00:04,170 --> 02:00:09,170
We're gonna run into some like bat anti
biotic resistant strain of something

4370
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:14,100
soon that's gonna fucking tear
us up because apparently it's,

4371
02:00:14,101 --> 02:00:15,590
it's caused by like factory farms.

4372
02:00:15,591 --> 02:00:18,680
They pumped those animals full of shit
so they can live like on top of each

4373
02:00:18,681 --> 02:00:22,520
other and something vicious
is gonna come up soon.

4374
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:23,421
Most likely,

4375
02:00:23,421 --> 02:00:23,781
right?

4376
02:00:23,781 --> 02:00:25,730
If we keep fucking around
with the ecosystem,

4377
02:00:25,731 --> 02:00:27,030
it bounces back like,

4378
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:27,230
yeah,

4379
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:28,370
all these dead bees,

4380
02:00:28,371 --> 02:00:28,840
man.

4381
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:29,210
Yeah.

4382
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:30,410
That's a weird thing man.

4383
02:00:30,411 --> 02:00:31,750
That the amount of oil that's,

4384
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:36,260
that's probably the GMO crops where
they think that they think that that has

4385
02:00:36,261 --> 02:00:37,330
something to do is actually an artist.

4386
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:37,750
Cool.

4387
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:38,583
Um,

4388
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:39,230
uh,

4389
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:44,230
from my twitter feed the other day
from a Seattle organic restaurants.com,

4390
02:00:45,650 --> 02:00:50,650
whereas just talking about the pesticides
manufactured by Bayer and Syngenta,

4391
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:52,920
94 percent of GMO corn in the u.

4392
02:00:52,921 --> 02:00:56,630
s is treated with either
while we listen to this word,

4393
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:57,510
Imo,

4394
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:58,020
Dac,

4395
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:02,770
glow printed or clothing and it didn't.

4396
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,171
Oh,

4397
02:01:03,171 --> 02:01:04,580
I love that stuff on my pasta.

4398
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:05,840
That sounds good for your corn.

4399
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:07,460
Corn Tastes Yummy.

4400
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:11,000
This guy did this thing where we put
a square box and he counted all the

4401
02:01:11,001 --> 02:01:14,900
biodiversity inside of it for like 24
hours in different parts of the world and

4402
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,590
there's tons of,

4403
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:16,080
you know,

4404
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,560
24 hours you find all kinds of
insects and all kinds of shit.

4405
02:01:18,561 --> 02:01:19,370
Flowers and anything.

4406
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:23,330
You put it in a cornfield in Iowa or
whatever and like over 24 hours he found

4407
02:01:23,331 --> 02:01:25,820
like three insects or something
because it kills everything.

4408
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:26,810
Wow.

4409
02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:26,991
Yeah.

4410
02:01:26,991 --> 02:01:28,820
That's the way you can grow
that corn and nobody eats it.

4411
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:32,030
You gotta just jacket full
of all kinds of wacky stuff.

4412
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:32,330
Yeah.

4413
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:36,040
They say that also cell phone signals
or messing around with bugs that it's a

4414
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:36,830
beat.

4415
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:40,040
A bees communicate with a some sort of

4416
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:44,120
a frequency that gets
interfered with by cell phones.

4417
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:45,230
They can pick up on that.

4418
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:46,910
So when they're flying around,

4419
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:49,040
they hear the transmissions,

4420
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:49,903
they feel them,

4421
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:50,971
and then it diverse.

4422
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:54,510
So now bees are listed in
our phone calls to grow.

4423
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:55,480
God dammit.

4424
02:01:55,620 --> 02:01:56,960
So bees looking at cocktail

4425
02:01:58,520 --> 02:01:59,840
appease affected myself.

4426
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:04,850
Am I on top of their head also while
they have those multiple facet eyes?

4427
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:06,003
It's a lot of eyes.

4428
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:06,350
Yeah.

4429
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:08,150
They have eyes that are like,

4430
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:11,270
like pull up a bi because they're pretty
trippy when you see them in real life.

4431
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:13,581
Yeah.

4432
02:02:13,581 --> 02:02:14,414
There's a.

4433
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:15,201
That was uh,

4434
02:02:15,201 --> 02:02:19,350
that was a concern a few
years ago that was started.

4435
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:20,121
They were starting to.

4436
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:25,121
I'm trying to figure out what was
causing the bees to a drop off and they

4437
02:02:25,581 --> 02:02:26,510
thought it was killing him,

4438
02:02:26,511 --> 02:02:27,860
but they say they're not killing them.

4439
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:30,380
They're pretty sure that cell
phones aren't killing bees,

4440
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:33,380
but they're definitely disturbing
them and they're definitely,

4441
02:02:33,381 --> 02:02:37,520
I'm fucking with their ability
to communicate and people
don't realize that when

4442
02:02:37,521 --> 02:02:38,330
the bees are gone,

4443
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:40,010
we're in a lot of trouble.

4444
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,371
Yeah.

4445
02:02:40,371 --> 02:02:43,610
Have you seen those crazy little
artificial bees at Monsanto's created?

4446
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:44,540
I heard about him.

4447
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:44,870
I didn't.

4448
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:45,703
I didn't say anything.

4449
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:47,600
Just as weird as the drone thing.

4450
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:48,740
Tiny drones.

4451
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:49,640
The drone bees.

4452
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:52,300
The idea is create something
that can do the work of a bee.

4453
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:52,850
Yeah,

4454
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:56,120
because apparently they'll rent beehives
and you gotta like someone will bring

4455
02:02:56,121 --> 02:02:57,920
it out to like pollinate your shit.

4456
02:02:58,230 --> 02:02:59,660
That dragon fly eyes.

4457
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:03,330
See these are probably from the future
and this whole time these are like just a

4458
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:04,670
little drones recording us.

4459
02:03:06,490 --> 02:03:07,323
Hologram.

4460
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:09,080
See?

4461
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:09,411
Would it be.

4462
02:03:09,411 --> 02:03:10,760
I was a hologram world.

4463
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:12,040
Yeah.

4464
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:13,190
They're so fucking strange.

4465
02:03:13,830 --> 02:03:17,480
I mean we're just looking at them as
if they're normal because we see them

4466
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:18,980
everyday and they are part of our life,

4467
02:03:18,981 --> 02:03:21,410
but if we didn't know about bees,

4468
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,131
they didn't exist.

4469
02:03:22,131 --> 02:03:23,600
Then all of a sudden
there was bees everywhere.

4470
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:24,081
We'd be like,

4471
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:24,950
what the fuck?

4472
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,113
Those things.

4473
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:29,900
It's weird little things that can sting
you and fuck you up and if you're one of

4474
02:03:29,901 --> 02:03:31,910
those poor people that's
allergic to bee stings,

4475
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:33,650
that must be terrifying.

4476
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:36,080
Go into a field and everywhere
you go you could die.

4477
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:38,230
You know you can get
stung by some country,

4478
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:39,073
little bug.

4479
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:40,460
It literally shuts your heart down.

4480
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:42,920
There's something beautifully ironic
about the fact that a lot of us can't

4481
02:03:42,921 --> 02:03:44,150
survive in a field anymore.

4482
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:45,223
It's true.

4483
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:49,070
Kenny peanut butter cancer
having to field can't smoke weed.

4484
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:53,300
Oh Wow.

4485
02:03:53,301 --> 02:03:54,140
That's so strange.

4486
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:55,490
It looks like technology.

4487
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:55,791
It doesn't.

4488
02:03:55,791 --> 02:03:56,151
It doesn't.

4489
02:03:56,151 --> 02:03:57,080
That look like.

4490
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:57,580
Well,

4491
02:03:57,580 --> 02:04:00,110
it also looks like it
looks like it's fractal,

4492
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:00,501
you know,

4493
02:04:00,501 --> 02:04:05,150
like all those pine cones and you
know when you see a sunflower seeds,

4494
02:04:05,410 --> 02:04:07,470
like sunflower seeds inside of it at all.

4495
02:04:07,471 --> 02:04:08,560
It looks fractal.

4496
02:04:08,561 --> 02:04:08,841
They all,

4497
02:04:08,841 --> 02:04:09,674
they all look like,

4498
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:10,231
you know,

4499
02:04:10,231 --> 02:04:11,270
like it's all.

4500
02:04:11,271 --> 02:04:13,100
I'm like a geometric pattern.

4501
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:15,020
Million years of evolution.

4502
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:16,123
So weird.

4503
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:18,470
So weird that they developed eyes like,

4504
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:19,740
you know,

4505
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:23,960
we developed eyes like this and then
there's also shit that developed eyes like

4506
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:24,620
us,

4507
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:29,300
but completely outside of
us like mollusks octopus.

4508
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:30,650
Their eyes are very similar.

4509
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:35,450
Squids and octopus octopus are
incredibly smart to allegedly taken like

4510
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,440
heightened shells and things
to use tools and shit.

4511
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:39,230
Too bad they are delicious.

4512
02:04:39,770 --> 02:04:42,450
They can also climb out of a fish tank,

4513
02:04:42,451 --> 02:04:43,380
walk across the floor,

4514
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:44,520
climate to another fish tank,

4515
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:45,090
eat the fish.

4516
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:46,250
Then climbed back to the other fish.

4517
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:47,580
Yeah.

4518
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:51,840
It was a famous story about a guy who had
these expensive fish is exotic fish in

4519
02:04:51,841 --> 02:04:55,290
the aquarium and one aquarium had
octopus in it and one aquarium had these

4520
02:04:55,291 --> 02:04:58,440
really expensive fish and the fish would
come up missing and the guy was like,

4521
02:04:58,441 --> 02:04:59,370
what the fuck is going on?

4522
02:04:59,371 --> 02:05:00,330
Like someone's stealing my fish.

4523
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:01,830
So he set up a security camera.

4524
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:04,440
It's like trying to figure out if someone
snuck into his house and stole his

4525
02:05:04,441 --> 02:05:06,270
expensive fish because it kept happening.

4526
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:10,020
So then he watched this
octopus lift up the lid.

4527
02:05:10,021 --> 02:05:10,800
If it's aquarium,

4528
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,090
climbed down the glass,

4529
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:13,950
I guess they can hold their
breath for a long time,

4530
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:15,240
walk across the ground,

4531
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:16,590
walk over to the other one,

4532
02:05:16,591 --> 02:05:17,550
climb inside of it,

4533
02:05:18,110 --> 02:05:18,810
the fish,

4534
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,190
eat it and go back.

4535
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:20,891
Tell me.

4536
02:05:20,891 --> 02:05:21,810
It was wearing a top hat.

4537
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:24,340
Yeah.

4538
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:24,680
Uh,

4539
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:25,151
on the,

4540
02:05:25,151 --> 02:05:27,250
on the category of weird animal shit.

4541
02:05:28,030 --> 02:05:30,670
You should look up the chicken that
lived for a year and a half without his

4542
02:05:30,671 --> 02:05:31,330
head.

4543
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:31,511
Oh,

4544
02:05:31,511 --> 02:05:32,051
I did see that.

4545
02:05:32,051 --> 02:05:32,820
Have you seen that?

4546
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:32,971
Yeah,

4547
02:05:32,971 --> 02:05:35,740
they had a piece of it,

4548
02:05:36,030 --> 02:05:37,240
the just the brainstem.

4549
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:39,190
So it was completely headless.

4550
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:42,250
A year and a half and he took it to a
university because everyone thought it was

4551
02:05:42,251 --> 02:05:42,730
a hoax.

4552
02:05:42,730 --> 02:05:43,420
How'd they eat?

4553
02:05:43,420 --> 02:05:46,180
How they had to rip shit into its neck.

4554
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,040
Mountain goats are insane.

4555
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:49,270
Look at Italy.

4556
02:05:49,271 --> 02:05:51,940
They're like super high up.

4557
02:05:51,941 --> 02:05:54,940
They're just climbing
sideways off the Damn Damn.

4558
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:55,530
Yeah.

4559
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,310
Mountain goats.

4560
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:59,580
They have actually these
really rough but flexible toes,

4561
02:05:59,581 --> 02:06:00,230
so they.

4562
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:02,830
They grab a hold of rocks
and they can get that.

4563
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:07,910
They can walk on shit like easily
that we could never walk on a spider.

4564
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:10,020
Go Nature.

4565
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:11,340
Use Crazy motherfucker.

4566
02:06:11,341 --> 02:06:13,080
You nature is weird.

4567
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,670
It has a lot of options.

4568
02:06:15,630 --> 02:06:16,590
Figures out a way,

4569
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:21,810
which is one of the more reprehensible
things about our denial that these

4570
02:06:21,811 --> 02:06:25,740
dolphins and orcas are intelligent beings
just because they're different than us

4571
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:27,720
and that's why we get away
with that kind of slavery

4572
02:06:29,330 --> 02:06:30,163
from

4573
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:32,550
what led you to become.

4574
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:33,900
To go from being like this,

4575
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:35,010
besides that one.

4576
02:06:35,011 --> 02:06:35,844
Fox News appearance,

4577
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:39,960
but to go from being this guy
who's got an act and you know,

4578
02:06:40,230 --> 02:06:42,840
fairly digestible and then you go,

4579
02:06:42,841 --> 02:06:43,400
you know what?

4580
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:44,210
I saw.

4581
02:06:44,210 --> 02:06:45,150
I got to say something.

4582
02:06:45,151 --> 02:06:45,411
All right,

4583
02:06:45,411 --> 02:06:46,040
this is.

4584
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:47,010
We're dealing with,

4585
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:48,810
I'm not satisfied with this anymore.

4586
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:49,261
Like what?

4587
02:06:49,261 --> 02:06:49,411
Yeah,

4588
02:06:49,411 --> 02:06:49,710
yeah.

4589
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:50,050
I,

4590
02:06:50,050 --> 02:06:50,461
I mean,

4591
02:06:50,461 --> 02:06:52,950
I think it started with the Iraq invasion,

4592
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:53,850
uh,

4593
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:57,930
that kind of started to wake me up and
then it just kept increasing and I woke

4594
02:06:57,931 --> 02:06:59,150
up more and more and you know,

4595
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:00,083
reading,

4596
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:01,590
reading a lot of great books,

4597
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:04,020
Chomsky and hedges and Shit and uh,

4598
02:07:04,330 --> 02:07:04,710
uh,

4599
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:05,200
yeah.

4600
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:05,680
And it,

4601
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:08,040
it infuriated me to the
point where I was like,

4602
02:07:08,041 --> 02:07:09,570
I got to talk about this shit on stage.

4603
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:10,550
I don't know,

4604
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:10,970
it was,

4605
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:11,500
it was a lot,

4606
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:12,490
a lot of anger and,

4607
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:13,230
and uh,

4608
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:15,480
how many years in what you doing
comedy before he started doing that?

4609
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:17,243
Um,

4610
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:20,880
I mean it probably been
like six or seven years,

4611
02:07:20,881 --> 02:07:23,040
but not all of those were full time,

4612
02:07:23,070 --> 02:07:26,370
so probably only like
three full time and then,

4613
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:27,623
but now it's,

4614
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:28,750
it's been a bunch of years.

4615
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:30,900
So we're just starting out in New York.

4616
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,920
No,

4617
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:33,030
I started out in Richmond,

4618
02:07:33,031 --> 02:07:33,511
Virginia,

4619
02:07:33,511 --> 02:07:35,600
University of Virginia and uh,

4620
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:37,750
then right after college
moved to New York City.

4621
02:07:37,970 --> 02:07:38,470
Yeah.

4622
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:40,030
So you started doing standup in Richmond?

4623
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:40,970
Yeah,

4624
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:42,640
I open mics and uh,

4625
02:07:42,650 --> 02:07:43,990
and at Uva I would,

4626
02:07:43,991 --> 02:07:44,330
uh,

4627
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:44,830
you know,

4628
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:48,610
open for whatever fucking
acts came through Darrell
Hammond and Jimmy Fallon and

4629
02:07:48,611 --> 02:07:48,980
stuff.

4630
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:50,030
Wow.

4631
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,560
Was that terrifying that
you probably went through?

4632
02:07:52,610 --> 02:07:53,331
That makes sense,

4633
02:07:53,331 --> 02:07:53,980
right?

4634
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:54,311
Yeah,

4635
02:07:54,311 --> 02:07:54,610
it was.

4636
02:07:54,610 --> 02:07:54,791
Well,

4637
02:07:54,791 --> 02:07:56,680
it was terrifying also
because I was not like a,

4638
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:58,090
I was not a performer.

4639
02:07:58,091 --> 02:08:01,400
I had never been on a stage in my life
until I decided to do stand up and

4640
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:03,953
wow,

4641
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:04,853
that's wild.

4642
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:09,000
So you do that for six or seven years and
then the Iraq war comes around and you

4643
02:08:09,001 --> 02:08:11,610
decide to do the kind of actor you
do it now where it's all like social

4644
02:08:11,611 --> 02:08:12,530
commentary and

4645
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:12,921
yeah,

4646
02:08:12,921 --> 02:08:14,600
it was a slow process because I feel like,

4647
02:08:14,601 --> 02:08:14,801
I mean,

4648
02:08:14,801 --> 02:08:15,020
you know,

4649
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,910
you talk about that Shit
and you know this well,

4650
02:08:16,911 --> 02:08:19,050
like you talked about the shit and you're
going to alienate some of the crowds

4651
02:08:19,051 --> 02:08:20,000
to figuring out how to,

4652
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:22,100
how to make them happy
enough that they're not,

4653
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:23,750
that you don't lose the crowd is it,

4654
02:08:23,751 --> 02:08:23,990
you know,

4655
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,740
it was a slow,

4656
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:28,700
slow learning experience and it kind of
moved over more and more and more until

4657
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:29,061
now.

4658
02:08:29,061 --> 02:08:30,910
It's probably 90 percent about,

4659
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:32,320
about world issues and shit.

4660
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:32,971
Yeah.

4661
02:08:32,971 --> 02:08:33,381
World is,

4662
02:08:33,381 --> 02:08:33,901
she's mad.

4663
02:08:33,901 --> 02:08:34,531
God Damn you.

4664
02:08:34,531 --> 02:08:36,090
And especially if you're a woman,

4665
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:39,750
if you're a woman and you're trying
to have a political opinion on stage,

4666
02:08:39,810 --> 02:08:40,621
good luck.

4667
02:08:40,621 --> 02:08:41,100
Yeah.

4668
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:44,040
There's so many shithead men that don't
want to listen to a woman that has a

4669
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:45,450
different opinion.

4670
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:45,730
No,

4671
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:46,150
do

4672
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:46,511
no doubt.

4673
02:08:46,511 --> 02:08:47,740
Because as it like,

4674
02:08:47,741 --> 02:08:51,010
there's a subconscious thing that goes
on where the audience does like kind of

4675
02:08:51,011 --> 02:08:53,950
doesn't want to lower themselves by
allowing the comedian to be funny.

4676
02:08:53,951 --> 02:08:54,251
And so,

4677
02:08:54,251 --> 02:08:55,150
especially with a woman,

4678
02:08:55,151 --> 02:08:57,100
you got dudes in the
audience watching a woman,

4679
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:00,250
they don't really want her to be funny
because it's kind of lowing lowering

4680
02:09:00,251 --> 02:09:01,210
yourself and,

4681
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:01,331
and,

4682
02:09:01,331 --> 02:09:06,250
and so the way that that's easiest
to achieve is I'm a slut or whatever,

4683
02:09:06,251 --> 02:09:07,110
and then they're,

4684
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,440
the men in the audience are like,

4685
02:09:08,441 --> 02:09:08,591
oh,

4686
02:09:08,591 --> 02:09:09,424
okay,

4687
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:10,291
yeah,

4688
02:09:10,291 --> 02:09:11,580
that's like the best way.

4689
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:14,030
If you don't go with the on the slot,

4690
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:16,260
you better be hideous looking now.

4691
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:19,290
You better be just some giant
fucking frying pan faced,

4692
02:09:19,770 --> 02:09:20,940
nonsexual,

4693
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:21,910
you know,

4694
02:09:21,910 --> 02:09:25,290
I mean to be like a really attractive
woman and be a stand up comedian boy,

4695
02:09:25,291 --> 02:09:26,124
a lot of.

4696
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:29,580
I shouldn't generalize because
there's people that break every mold,

4697
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:31,273
but it's this,

4698
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,640
it's a hard road that's hard.

4699
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:34,080
That's a hard fucking road.

4700
02:09:34,110 --> 02:09:34,980
Certainly be done.

4701
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:35,840
It's just difficult.

4702
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,140
I always said there's like three,

4703
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:37,890
um,

4704
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:40,110
three categories that uh,

4705
02:09:40,111 --> 02:09:41,280
your standup goes through.

4706
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:43,890
Like in the beginning you're
terrified to go on stage.

4707
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:45,210
It's just their tools,

4708
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:47,010
they just trying to get
laughs at the beginning.

4709
02:09:47,011 --> 02:09:48,750
You might not like the joke at all,

4710
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:51,990
but you think it works so you do it
because you just trying to get a laugh and

4711
02:09:51,991 --> 02:09:54,870
then once you get a little bit comfortable
then you start doing shit that you

4712
02:09:54,871 --> 02:09:57,690
think is funny shit that
you actually would laugh at.

4713
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:58,920
Like you'll laugh at your own jokes,

4714
02:09:58,921 --> 02:09:59,970
like this is actually pretty funny,

4715
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:03,720
and then you realize what your own actual
sense of humor is and you figure out a

4716
02:10:03,721 --> 02:10:04,560
way to express that.

4717
02:10:05,010 --> 02:10:08,220
Then and then some people
never make this third step.

4718
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:11,400
They don't have to like the
greats like Hedberg Steven,

4719
02:10:11,401 --> 02:10:11,641
right?

4720
02:10:11,641 --> 02:10:14,430
They never made this third step and
there's still amongst the very best ever,

4721
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,210
so it's not a.

4722
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:16,410
it's not a mandatory step,

4723
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:18,710
but for a lot of people that get
to the position that you were in,

4724
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:19,230
they always say,

4725
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:21,660
I decide I want to make my opinions funny.

4726
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:26,760
I want to figure out a way to
make the ideas that I think

4727
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:33,120
these ideas that are representative of
how fucking silly we are as a society.

4728
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:34,070
Turn them

4729
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:35,750
into not just funny,

4730
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:38,840
but something that makes
you an eyeopening funny,

4731
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:41,870
like you go back to work and you express
it and then everybody laughs and go,

4732
02:10:41,871 --> 02:10:42,704
always fucking right.

4733
02:10:43,170 --> 02:10:44,003
That's funny.

4734
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:45,111
Yeah.

4735
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:47,670
I think that third step
also takes a full on.

4736
02:10:47,671 --> 02:10:47,800
Yeah.

4737
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:51,490
Confidence in what you're doing because
you're going to alienate some people and

4738
02:10:51,491 --> 02:10:51,971
you've got to be like,

4739
02:10:51,971 --> 02:10:52,661
fuck them,

4740
02:10:52,661 --> 02:10:53,680
I'm doing this anyway.

4741
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:54,320
Yeah,

4742
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:54,771
for sure.

4743
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:56,210
Especially if they don't know who you are.

4744
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:56,960
Right?

4745
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:57,180
Yeah.

4746
02:10:57,180 --> 02:10:57,620
Yeah.

4747
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:58,010
I will.

4748
02:10:58,010 --> 02:10:59,810
Once you got a ton of
celebrity behind you,

4749
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:01,340
I think it changes a little bit,

4750
02:11:01,341 --> 02:11:03,260
but do you find that because
of your youtube videos,

4751
02:11:03,261 --> 02:11:04,790
you're very popular youtube channel,

4752
02:11:04,810 --> 02:11:06,260
does that make the biggest
difference for you?

4753
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:07,760
That's like been your sort of blog,

4754
02:11:07,761 --> 02:11:08,030
right?

4755
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:08,421
Yeah.

4756
02:11:08,421 --> 02:11:09,980
That's been the main thing
that's made a difference,

4757
02:11:09,981 --> 02:11:10,940
a moment of clarity.

4758
02:11:10,941 --> 02:11:11,690
It's called and,

4759
02:11:11,690 --> 02:11:12,170
and uh,

4760
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:16,270
started doing that three years
ago to 180 episodes in now and uh,

4761
02:11:16,510 --> 02:11:16,840
and,

4762
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:18,740
and it's nice because
that's like international.

4763
02:11:18,741 --> 02:11:19,360
It's like a,

4764
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:19,610
you know,

4765
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:21,580
I can go toward the UK and I'm not,

4766
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:23,870
I'm not saying I get billions
of people to come out,

4767
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:24,860
but there's fans everywhere,

4768
02:11:24,861 --> 02:11:25,400
which is really good.

4769
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:25,910
Cool.

4770
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:28,070
Just the most incredible
thing about the internet.

4771
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:29,630
It's like something like this podcast,

4772
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:31,460
I would have never done this.

4773
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:34,160
Internet didn't exist and aren't you
still amazed when you get the fan from

4774
02:11:34,161 --> 02:11:35,360
Romania or whatever?

4775
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:36,540
Like I'm amazed at all of it.

4776
02:11:36,541 --> 02:11:37,040
I'm amazing.

4777
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,210
Anybody's listening this fucking thing.

4778
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:42,740
It's just the whole idea of a podcast
is incredible that you need this little

4779
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:43,510
equipment.

4780
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:43,761
Yeah.

4781
02:11:43,761 --> 02:11:44,594
And then boom,

4782
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:45,980
it's out there to millions of people.

4783
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:46,440
I do.

4784
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:47,370
I do a podcast too,

4785
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,620
but the main thing is the
moment clarity videos.

4786
02:11:49,621 --> 02:11:50,170
Yeah.

4787
02:11:50,170 --> 02:11:51,380
What's the difference
between your podcast,

4788
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:52,010
the moment of clarity?

4789
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:52,570
Why?

4790
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:53,051
Why is,

4791
02:11:53,051 --> 02:11:53,560
um,

4792
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:55,650
you put more effort into the
moment of clarity things.

4793
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:56,450
I put more up

4794
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:59,910
the end of the videos and they're
also short the three to five minutes,

4795
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:01,170
whereas the podcast,

4796
02:12:01,171 --> 02:12:01,351
I'll,

4797
02:12:01,351 --> 02:12:01,460
I'll,

4798
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:02,170
you know,

4799
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:04,090
talk about issues for half hour.

4800
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:06,550
When you do a solo podcast
or just you talking?

4801
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:07,541
It's often sold,

4802
02:12:07,541 --> 02:12:09,070
although I will do
interviews occasionally,

4803
02:12:09,071 --> 02:12:10,360
but a lot of times,

4804
02:12:10,361 --> 02:12:12,520
so I always say I'm going
to do a solo podcast,

4805
02:12:12,521 --> 02:12:13,840
but I haven't done one
since the beginning.

4806
02:12:13,950 --> 02:12:15,400
At the beginning I used to do solo once.

4807
02:12:15,410 --> 02:12:17,310
I used to just have ideas and just.

4808
02:12:17,710 --> 02:12:19,390
But it's too much work.

4809
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,321
Also,

4810
02:12:20,321 --> 02:12:21,340
you got to carry the whole thing.

4811
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:26,460
It's tough to carry a little bird as a
few people that can actually cause that.

4812
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:28,241
Oh yeah.

4813
02:12:28,241 --> 02:12:28,630
Bill Verge.

4814
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:28,811
Great.

4815
02:12:28,811 --> 02:12:29,030
Yeah,

4816
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:30,580
that's perfect for that.

4817
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:32,600
I guess you know like bills,

4818
02:12:32,610 --> 02:12:34,480
that type of guy that
likes to talk over people,

4819
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:38,650
but bill is the type of guy that has a
lot of shit to say about a lot of shit

4820
02:12:38,651 --> 02:12:40,240
that maybe you wouldn't give a fuck about.

4821
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:42,370
But bill get angry about something like,

4822
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:42,700
no,

4823
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:42,941
no,

4824
02:12:42,941 --> 02:12:43,151
no,

4825
02:12:43,151 --> 02:12:43,360
no.

4826
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:44,193
Because what they're trying,

4827
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:46,960
he'll go on these like really long rent.

4828
02:12:46,961 --> 02:12:50,230
So it's almost like for him it's
perfect because for a lot of people they

4829
02:12:50,231 --> 02:12:51,250
wouldn't have that.

4830
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:54,550
Like his sense of humor is so aggressive.

4831
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:55,660
Boston,

4832
02:12:55,990 --> 02:12:57,400
you're not fucking me over.

4833
02:12:57,401 --> 02:12:58,780
I see what you're doing,

4834
02:12:59,050 --> 02:12:59,770
you know,

4835
02:12:59,770 --> 02:13:01,480
one of his bits and I love the most,

4836
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:06,540
is he does this bit about all these
movies where there's a black team and the

4837
02:13:07,271 --> 02:13:12,130
black team has all these odds and all
these racist and the white people trying

4838
02:13:12,131 --> 02:13:13,060
to keep down the black team.

4839
02:13:13,061 --> 02:13:16,870
Like how long are we
going to make this movie?

4840
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:20,410
It was one about synchronized
swimming or running out of sports.

4841
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:20,700
Yeah.

4842
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:21,820
Like they can't swim.

4843
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:23,220
It's such a good bit.

4844
02:13:23,230 --> 02:13:24,220
It's such a funny bit,

4845
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:28,480
but it's one of those things
where it's such a bill burr bit,

4846
02:13:28,540 --> 02:13:28,931
you know,

4847
02:13:28,931 --> 02:13:31,030
and it's such a Boston bit too.

4848
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:34,560
It's like his style is
one of my favorite styles.

4849
02:13:34,561 --> 02:13:37,200
That Boston aggressive style of comedy.

4850
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:37,930
Yeah.

4851
02:13:37,930 --> 02:13:38,310
Yeah.

4852
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:39,840
His Shit's great.

4853
02:13:40,530 --> 02:13:40,801
Yeah.

4854
02:13:40,801 --> 02:13:41,220
And He.

4855
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:45,210
So that style of ranting about shit
lends itself perfectly to podcasts.

4856
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:45,960
Yeah.

4857
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:46,350
Yeah.

4858
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:46,770
It's,

4859
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:47,603
it's.

4860
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,590
I mean that's the nice
thing about what I do is,

4861
02:13:49,591 --> 02:13:51,090
is it still very ranty style?

4862
02:13:51,091 --> 02:13:51,720
And so,

4863
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:52,180
uh,

4864
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:55,110
it fits well on podcasts and
it fits well and those videos.

4865
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:56,060
But uh,

4866
02:13:56,060 --> 02:13:56,370
you know,

4867
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,760
it doesn't fit well on late night shows.

4868
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:00,340
Gross man,

4869
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:01,440
you don't need those anymore.

4870
02:14:02,430 --> 02:14:04,320
I really don't think
people need those anymore.

4871
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:04,711
I mean,

4872
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:05,730
I'm not joking around.

4873
02:14:05,731 --> 02:14:06,900
I think they're nonsense.

4874
02:14:06,901 --> 02:14:08,970
I think those are just like silent movies,

4875
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:11,210
like the why.

4876
02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:12,290
Why are you doing that?

4877
02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:13,200
Why are you doing it like that?

4878
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:14,063
That's dumb.

4879
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,680
Who would go to see a new silent movie?

4880
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:19,860
I saw the hobbit last night.

4881
02:14:19,861 --> 02:14:21,120
It was fucking awesome.

4882
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:22,440
It is in three d,

4883
02:14:22,441 --> 02:14:23,221
the dragons.

4884
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:23,790
Incredible.

4885
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:24,780
She's the one before it.

4886
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:25,720
Yes.

4887
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:26,280
Did you like that?

4888
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:26,770
No,

4889
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:27,090
no.

4890
02:14:27,090 --> 02:14:27,541
That one.

4891
02:14:27,541 --> 02:14:30,540
I felt like it was a bunch of shit
happening that was setting this one up.

4892
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:33,900
Do the dragon is worth
the price of admission.

4893
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:36,990
So the trailer trailer
looked pretty damn good.

4894
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:37,680
Oh,

4895
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:39,210
the dragons to start the fucking movie.

4896
02:14:39,211 --> 02:14:39,841
I hope they don't kill them.

4897
02:14:39,841 --> 02:14:43,230
And the next one we're seeing the
most of it or just like the very end.

4898
02:14:43,231 --> 02:14:45,440
You got to get to like halfway to
the moon before the dragon comes out,

4899
02:14:45,441 --> 02:14:46,950
but there's no bad parts in the movie.

4900
02:14:46,951 --> 02:14:47,940
The movie is fun.

4901
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:49,350
It's fun from the beginning to the end.

4902
02:14:49,351 --> 02:14:50,880
It's way better than the last one.

4903
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:52,830
The last one to me was kind of flat,

4904
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:53,711
but I think it was just,

4905
02:14:53,711 --> 02:14:55,140
there was so much to set up,

4906
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:58,950
but this one fuck and wicked dude.

4907
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,360
So wicked.

4908
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,980
The dragon is so good.

4909
02:15:01,981 --> 02:15:02,820
He talks.

4910
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:07,560
It's so cool.

4911
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:08,393
Who Does the voice?

4912
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:08,790
Uh,

4913
02:15:08,790 --> 02:15:10,980
the dude who was con on Star Trek.

4914
02:15:11,670 --> 02:15:12,150
Yeah.

4915
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:13,420
Not Ricardo [inaudible].

4916
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:14,520
The original con.

4917
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:15,960
Unfortunately rest his soul.

4918
02:15:15,961 --> 02:15:16,950
I don't think he's with us anymore,

4919
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:18,290
but the other con,

4920
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:19,171
uh,

4921
02:15:19,171 --> 02:15:20,430
a friend of mine just died.

4922
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,270
MMA Guy,

4923
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:22,103
Joe Camacho,

4924
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:23,040
the 41 years old.

4925
02:15:23,041 --> 02:15:23,400
I can't,

4926
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:24,233
I can't believe it.

4927
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:26,720
People are dying young some.

4928
02:15:27,190 --> 02:15:31,260
And you know what's also weird is he was
such good health and he made it to the

4929
02:15:31,261 --> 02:15:31,921
hospital.

4930
02:15:31,921 --> 02:15:32,731
It sounded like.

4931
02:15:32,731 --> 02:15:33,271
It sounded like,

4932
02:15:33,271 --> 02:15:33,421
you know,

4933
02:15:33,421 --> 02:15:36,300
if you read the report that the
wife was said that she woke up,

4934
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:38,700
he was screaming and they
called the ambulance.

4935
02:15:38,701 --> 02:15:40,020
The ambulance came and then he,

4936
02:15:40,021 --> 02:15:40,430
you know,

4937
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:42,120
was announced dead at the hospital.

4938
02:15:42,121 --> 02:15:43,890
It seems like with heart
attacks you always think,

4939
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:44,191
oh,

4940
02:15:44,191 --> 02:15:45,024
you could revive them.

4941
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:45,810
You know,

4942
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:46,920
especially a healthy guy.

4943
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:47,221
Yeah.

4944
02:15:47,221 --> 02:15:47,760
I don't get it.

4945
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,090
He just fought a couple of weeks
ago and he's fighting still.

4946
02:15:51,090 --> 02:15:51,871
It was 41 years old.

4947
02:15:51,871 --> 02:15:53,880
He ran a martial arts academy
that guards in tremendous shape.

4948
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:55,531
I don't know,

4949
02:15:55,531 --> 02:15:55,820
man.

4950
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:56,310
That's crazy.

4951
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:59,970
Maybe the government man government is
wanting to teach people how to kick ass

4952
02:15:59,971 --> 02:16:00,804
when they take over.

4953
02:16:00,830 --> 02:16:01,740
So it was bs.

4954
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:02,850
It's fucking bs.

4955
02:16:02,910 --> 02:16:04,020
It's antibacterial soap.

4956
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:05,670
Um,

4957
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:10,050
there's a fucking article right here in
the front of CNN about vitamins being a

4958
02:16:10,051 --> 02:16:10,884
waste of money.

4959
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:12,540
Editorial and Medical Journal says,

4960
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:13,374
yes,

4961
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:14,070
they,

4962
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:19,050
I've heard things that a lot of vitamins
I've proven that do much taken in that

4963
02:16:19,110 --> 02:16:19,943
form,

4964
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:21,150
taken in pill form.

4965
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:25,290
It says the vitamins industry
is based on anecdote.

4966
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:25,861
People saying,

4967
02:16:25,861 --> 02:16:27,640
I like this and it makes me feel better.

4968
02:16:27,641 --> 02:16:27,860
I said,

4969
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:28,601
Dr Edgar Miller,

4970
02:16:28,601 --> 02:16:31,150
I'm professor of Medicine
Epidemiologic Johns Hopkins,

4971
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:32,133
you know what the problem is?

4972
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,700
A lot of these guys that are saying this,

4973
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:36,550
they're trying to get attention for
their work and they're taking these

4974
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:40,180
controversial stances because measuring
someone's health and measuring whether

4975
02:16:40,181 --> 02:16:43,420
or not they would be healthier and
not be healthy based on whether or not

4976
02:16:43,421 --> 02:16:45,010
they're taking vitamins is very tricky.

4977
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:48,100
But we know for a fact that
vitamins cure a lot of shit.

4978
02:16:48,101 --> 02:16:49,660
Scurvy take vitamin C,

4979
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:50,583
scurvy goes away.

4980
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:50,940
You know,

4981
02:16:50,940 --> 02:16:53,830
we know for a fact that supplementing
vitamins has a positive effect on the

4982
02:16:53,831 --> 02:16:54,340
human body.

4983
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:56,350
And apparently there's a lot
of good tests for vitamin D.

4984
02:16:56,470 --> 02:16:57,550
it's all science.

4985
02:16:57,610 --> 02:17:02,260
I mean the reason why we can break these
molecules down to individual components

4986
02:17:02,261 --> 02:17:02,891
like vitamin A,

4987
02:17:02,891 --> 02:17:03,371
vitamin C,

4988
02:17:03,371 --> 02:17:04,710
vitamin D is because of fucking sciences,

4989
02:17:04,711 --> 02:17:07,510
because they realize there's an
effect that each one has its variable.

4990
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:08,050
There are different.

4991
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:09,010
They're different from each other.

4992
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:11,710
The idea that supplements
don't do you any good?

4993
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:13,240
I bet this guy is as shape,

4994
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:14,440
but he doesn't exercise,

4995
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:15,610
but he doesn't know his body.

4996
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:17,390
It's nonsense vitamins for sure.

4997
02:17:17,391 --> 02:17:18,224
If I can help you.

4998
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:18,880
They.

4999
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:21,580
It says vitamins didn't
prevent mortality in any way.

5000
02:17:21,590 --> 02:17:22,210
In addition,

5001
02:17:22,210 --> 02:17:22,391
what?

5002
02:17:22,391 --> 02:17:22,481
Well,

5003
02:17:22,481 --> 02:17:23,314
how can you tell?

5004
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:24,760
How do you know if
someone would have lived?

5005
02:17:24,761 --> 02:17:28,090
They didn't have vitamins and died because
he took vitamins or died because they

5006
02:17:28,091 --> 02:17:29,830
didn't have vitamins and would have lived.

5007
02:17:29,831 --> 02:17:30,130
They did.

5008
02:17:30,130 --> 02:17:30,790
You don't.

5009
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:32,470
The only way to do it
is to take to people.

5010
02:17:32,590 --> 02:17:34,030
Have them live the exact same life.

5011
02:17:34,031 --> 02:17:34,990
One guy takes vitamins,

5012
02:17:34,991 --> 02:17:37,000
one guy doesn't test
their blood along the way.

5013
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:38,470
They have the same life experiences,

5014
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:39,221
same stress,

5015
02:17:39,221 --> 02:17:39,980
the same.

5016
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:40,601
You can't do that.

5017
02:17:40,601 --> 02:17:41,230
Obviously.

5018
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:43,150
There's a lot of variables
when it comes to human health.

5019
02:17:43,151 --> 02:17:43,931
Stress,

5020
02:17:43,931 --> 02:17:44,800
your lifestyle,

5021
02:17:44,801 --> 02:17:46,120
the pollution that you live in.

5022
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:46,961
There's a lot of things,

5023
02:17:46,961 --> 02:17:50,890
but to say that the building
blocks of the human body,

5024
02:17:50,891 --> 02:17:54,070
new nutritional
supplements like vitamin A,

5025
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:54,461
D,

5026
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:54,970
C,

5027
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:55,181
b,

5028
02:17:55,181 --> 02:17:58,420
12 ones that we know absolutely
beneficially about it.

5029
02:17:58,570 --> 02:18:01,990
They don't inject vitamin B 12 into
athletes because it doesn't help.

5030
02:18:02,470 --> 02:18:04,000
They injected because it's awesome.

5031
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:06,580
Like if you ever had take vitamin B,

5032
02:18:06,581 --> 02:18:07,414
12 supplements,

5033
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:08,681
it's fucking great.

5034
02:18:08,681 --> 02:18:09,940
It gives you energy label.

5035
02:18:09,970 --> 02:18:10,721
Some will be at 12.

5036
02:18:10,721 --> 02:18:11,800
You spray it under your tongue,

5037
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:13,630
like give yourself a
big dose of [inaudible].

5038
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:14,613
It's fucking.

5039
02:18:14,810 --> 02:18:16,490
Does it depend on the way you take it in,

5040
02:18:16,491 --> 02:18:17,730
like whether it's a pill or a.

5041
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:18,910
well it,

5042
02:18:18,910 --> 02:18:19,180
the,

5043
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:23,510
the injectable b12 is the best and there's
some forms of vitamin C that's more

5044
02:18:23,511 --> 02:18:24,830
easily absorbed by the body.

5045
02:18:24,831 --> 02:18:27,530
But what can't be disputed
when these guys say,

5046
02:18:27,531 --> 02:18:30,390
when they're doing studies and me to you,

5047
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:31,573
it doesn't work.

5048
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:33,050
You can't do a study like that.

5049
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:37,280
What we know for a fact is
that people need vitamins.

5050
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:37,911
You need them,

5051
02:18:37,911 --> 02:18:38,960
you need them in your food,

5052
02:18:39,050 --> 02:18:39,883
you need them,

5053
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:41,120
you need them in your,

5054
02:18:41,121 --> 02:18:41,990
your nutrients,

5055
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:42,890
in your food.

5056
02:18:42,891 --> 02:18:45,860
You need to have building
blocks for repair.

5057
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:47,780
You need to give your body protein.

5058
02:18:47,781 --> 02:18:49,100
You need to give your body carbohydrates.

5059
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:50,450
And so we understand all that.

5060
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:50,850
Yeah.

5061
02:18:50,850 --> 02:18:54,290
There's a reason why they've broken
these vitamins down into individual

5062
02:18:54,380 --> 02:18:57,350
components because they
know what each one does it.

5063
02:18:57,351 --> 02:18:58,090
Yeah.

5064
02:18:58,090 --> 02:18:58,271
Well,

5065
02:18:58,271 --> 02:18:58,781
in the news,

5066
02:18:58,781 --> 02:19:00,000
I mean this is another media thing.

5067
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:01,210
The media loves a story,

5068
02:19:01,211 --> 02:19:03,790
like either vitamins do
everything or vitamins do nothing.

5069
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,960
Because that gets readers,

5070
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:05,860
you know,

5071
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:06,041
oh,

5072
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:06,940
it's a gray area,

5073
02:19:06,941 --> 02:19:07,541
or oh,

5074
02:19:07,541 --> 02:19:10,120
they probably do something or none
of those articles getting read.

5075
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:11,710
So instead you put the article like,

5076
02:19:11,711 --> 02:19:11,981
Oh,

5077
02:19:11,981 --> 02:19:13,360
this guy says they do nothing.

5078
02:19:13,690 --> 02:19:14,200
Yeah.

5079
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:15,290
This is one of the guys

5080
02:19:15,850 --> 02:19:17,770
a retort to it.

5081
02:19:17,771 --> 02:19:19,070
So they believe vitamins,

5082
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:20,111
multivitamins,

5083
02:19:20,111 --> 02:19:22,030
addressing nutritional
deficiencies in people.

5084
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,280
We don't believe that they're
the answer to all life ailments,

5085
02:19:24,281 --> 02:19:25,930
such as the editorial suggests,

5086
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:29,810
and I think that's one of the problems
with saying that vitamins don't help is

5087
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:31,453
without a doubt.

5088
02:19:31,490 --> 02:19:33,080
Nutritional deficiencies
are not good for you.

5089
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:35,690
You can live through them and
you could live a dollar life,

5090
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:38,420
but if you take good food into your body,

5091
02:19:38,421 --> 02:19:39,440
you will feel better.

5092
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:41,960
And the reason for that
is nutrients for sure.

5093
02:19:41,961 --> 02:19:43,520
You should get it from live food,

5094
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:47,450
from vegetables and from fresh
vegetables and fresh meats.

5095
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:48,351
That's for sure.

5096
02:19:48,351 --> 02:19:50,990
We should get your vitamins if you
can eat a balanced out that way,

5097
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:53,840
but supplementing is better
than not supplementing.

5098
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:54,733
It just is.

5099
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:56,270
I mean it's pretty much proven

5100
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:56,790
and,

5101
02:19:56,790 --> 02:20:00,440
and we don't always understand what
those deficiencies due to our brain.

5102
02:20:00,441 --> 02:20:01,430
Whereas physically,

5103
02:20:01,431 --> 02:20:02,600
if you could see if you're getting fat,

5104
02:20:02,601 --> 02:20:04,110
you can see if you're getting out of a,

5105
02:20:04,210 --> 02:20:04,930
you know,

5106
02:20:04,930 --> 02:20:05,631
unhealthy or whatever,

5107
02:20:05,631 --> 02:20:05,900
but,

5108
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:08,720
but brain activity intelligence,

5109
02:20:08,721 --> 02:20:09,680
like we can't see that.

5110
02:20:09,681 --> 02:20:12,470
So we don't know what eating
all this shit does to our brain.

5111
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:13,190
No doubt.

5112
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,580
I mean,

5113
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:15,410
you want to really clean up your body.

5114
02:20:15,411 --> 02:20:16,430
You want to really be healthy,

5115
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,740
cut out the processed food first,

5116
02:20:18,830 --> 02:20:20,000
just cut out all that stuff.

5117
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:21,200
If you can cut out,

5118
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:22,850
cut out all the stuff.

5119
02:20:22,851 --> 02:20:26,060
That's not just natural things that
animals have been eating forever,

5120
02:20:26,061 --> 02:20:27,650
like vegetables and meat and eggs,

5121
02:20:27,651 --> 02:20:28,490
all the normal stuff.

5122
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:29,900
As soon as you cut out all that stuff.

5123
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:30,471
Even dairy.

5124
02:20:30,471 --> 02:20:31,670
I've started cutting out dairy.

5125
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:32,600
God dammit.

5126
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:34,430
I was listening to Tony Hinchcliffe
the other day and I was like,

5127
02:20:34,431 --> 02:20:35,510
I don't want to cut out dairy,

5128
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:36,350
but if you do

5129
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:37,390
you feel better.

5130
02:20:37,390 --> 02:20:38,223
Super Twink,

5131
02:20:38,290 --> 02:20:38,920
super twitches.

5132
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:39,753
New Name.

5133
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:40,810
Don't refer to them as anything.

5134
02:20:40,811 --> 02:20:41,320
Other than that.

5135
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:42,020
He's happy with it.

5136
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:42,760
I was going with it.

5137
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:46,450
Didn't we get like this country got crazy
into like milk and dairy after like a

5138
02:20:46,451 --> 02:20:47,590
lobbying campaign when it.

5139
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:48,490
Was that what it was?

5140
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:48,971
I think so.

5141
02:20:48,971 --> 02:20:50,410
I think like in the fifties and sixties,

5142
02:20:50,411 --> 02:20:51,244
like milk,

5143
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:52,420
like dairy farmers said,

5144
02:20:52,421 --> 02:20:53,030
hey yeah,

5145
02:20:53,030 --> 02:20:56,170
give you a glass of milk everyday of
the week or whatever every morning,

5146
02:20:57,020 --> 02:21:00,160
but I feel like we weren't
as big into it before that

5147
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:01,371
maybe.

5148
02:21:01,371 --> 02:21:01,551
I mean,

5149
02:21:01,551 --> 02:21:02,384
it makes sense.

5150
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:03,261
Totally makes sense.

5151
02:21:03,261 --> 02:21:05,270
It makes sense that they would try to,

5152
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:06,123
uh,

5153
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:07,190
try to do that.

5154
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:08,120
I mean,

5155
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:08,410
look,

5156
02:21:08,410 --> 02:21:08,900
they,

5157
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:10,550
whenever there's a way to make more money,

5158
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:11,960
if there's a way to make money,

5159
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:13,130
that's what they do.

5160
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:15,500
Can we make more money by
pretending people need milk?

5161
02:21:15,501 --> 02:21:17,570
Let's fucking a glass of milk a day.

5162
02:21:17,571 --> 02:21:20,720
It's shown to make your children
grow an extra entry here.

5163
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:21,440
You know,

5164
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:24,740
back in the old days they would talk about
pall mall loves being our pall malls.

5165
02:21:24,741 --> 02:21:25,660
Being the cigarettes at.

5166
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:26,510
Yeah.

5167
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:26,721
Yeah.

5168
02:21:26,721 --> 02:21:29,150
I have that poster up in my office.

5169
02:21:29,430 --> 02:21:32,810
It was like a four out of five
doctors love camels or whatever.

5170
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:36,680
And that was our parent's lifetime.

5171
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:39,410
They were the fifties,

5172
02:21:39,411 --> 02:21:40,790
maybe sixties.

5173
02:21:40,791 --> 02:21:42,240
When was that fits in?

5174
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:43,153
No,

5175
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:44,180
not even that long ago.

5176
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:45,411
Well,

5177
02:21:45,411 --> 02:21:45,951
I was born in [inaudible],

5178
02:21:45,951 --> 02:21:46,730
67.

5179
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:48,710
My mom was 21 when I was born,

5180
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:50,930
so she lived in the fifties.

5181
02:21:50,990 --> 02:21:52,860
She saw that shit when she
was a kid will get this,

5182
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:55,400
blow it in her face and
she'll follow you anywhere.

5183
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:56,660
Blow it in her face.

5184
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:57,581
Oh my God.

5185
02:21:57,581 --> 02:21:58,520
It's a low joke.

5186
02:21:59,150 --> 02:21:59,990
They had a low joe,

5187
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:00,711
but what is that?

5188
02:22:00,711 --> 02:22:01,670
I don't even know what that is.

5189
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:02,533
It's a cigarette.

5190
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:02,841
Yeah,

5191
02:22:02,841 --> 02:22:04,340
but see if you can find the.

5192
02:22:04,341 --> 02:22:05,000
The cow,

5193
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,620
the doctor Pall Mall.

5194
02:22:06,621 --> 02:22:07,340
Dr. Ads.

5195
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:12,340
That's what a Johnny Carson used to
smoke until his lungs became these black,

5196
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:17,411
shriveled up things dangling from his
neck rattling around inside of his

5197
02:22:18,411 --> 02:22:19,460
wheezing chest.

5198
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:23,620
More Dr. smoke camels than any
other cigarettes though it says,

5199
02:22:25,730 --> 02:22:26,060
look at

5200
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:26,840
that.

5201
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:28,610
That's so crazy.

5202
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:32,390
They used to do that to watch those old
movies or someone go to the doctor and

5203
02:22:32,391 --> 02:22:34,100
the doctor would be smoking
cigarettes in the office.

5204
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,983
Yeah.

5205
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:35,501
Well,

5206
02:22:35,501 --> 02:22:36,850
look at this for 30 days.

5207
02:22:36,851 --> 02:22:39,440
Test camels in your t zone throat.

5208
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:41,950
I saw another poster that showed the like,

5209
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:43,540
it's like it's good for your teeth.

5210
02:22:43,541 --> 02:22:44,620
Zone your throat.

5211
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:45,790
Oh my God.

5212
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:47,290
What was the year that Brian?

5213
02:22:51,830 --> 02:22:52,780
That's so crazy.

5214
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:54,790
So crazy that that was.

5215
02:22:54,791 --> 02:22:55,121
I mean,

5216
02:22:55,121 --> 02:22:57,460
it couldn't have been any earlier
than the forties or fifties.

5217
02:22:57,670 --> 02:23:01,120
That's how quickly things evolve
and that's not even 100 years,

5218
02:23:01,121 --> 02:23:01,451
man.

5219
02:23:01,451 --> 02:23:02,284
That's nuts.

5220
02:23:02,470 --> 02:23:04,090
They thought you're supposed
to smoke cigarettes.

5221
02:23:04,350 --> 02:23:04,961
Do you ever see the.

5222
02:23:04,961 --> 02:23:06,430
I'm a J.

5223
02:23:06,430 --> 02:23:10,930
Edgar Hoover movie with Leonardo Dicaprio
is part of the movie where his mom is

5224
02:23:10,931 --> 02:23:14,620
telling him that your doctor's been
telling you to smoke to make your more,

5225
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:16,000
to make you more vital.

5226
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:17,110
You need to smoke.

5227
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:17,240
Yeah,

5228
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:18,190
I listen to the doctor.

5229
02:23:18,770 --> 02:23:19,603
Amazing.

5230
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:20,473
That's amazing.

5231
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:23,060
Here's the t zone and see it says your,

5232
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:23,511
uh,

5233
02:23:23,511 --> 02:23:24,590
your t zone,

5234
02:23:24,890 --> 02:23:27,320
which will tell you t for throat.

5235
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,513
That's the,

5236
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:29,930
that's the,

5237
02:23:29,930 --> 02:23:31,190
that's the page I have in mind.

5238
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:33,920
What the hell is that your t zone with?

5239
02:23:34,670 --> 02:23:35,750
How are these people?

5240
02:23:35,751 --> 02:23:37,100
Not all in jail.

5241
02:23:37,610 --> 02:23:38,300
Seriously.

5242
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:38,451
Oh,

5243
02:23:38,451 --> 02:23:39,261
and it's the same.

5244
02:23:39,261 --> 02:23:41,860
One of the dudes that was behind
some of these campaigns that,

5245
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:43,033
that said,

5246
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:43,521
smoking.

5247
02:23:43,521 --> 02:23:45,200
We can't prove smoking harms people.

5248
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:48,230
It's the same dude that's in
charge of climate denial stuff.

5249
02:23:48,231 --> 02:23:48,471
Yeah.

5250
02:23:48,471 --> 02:23:49,041
Same thing.

5251
02:23:49,041 --> 02:23:50,750
Just put some doubt in people's minds.

5252
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:51,793
You can't prove it.

5253
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:53,033
How about this?

5254
02:23:53,390 --> 02:23:55,310
Santa Santa Smoking,

5255
02:23:55,930 --> 02:23:58,610
this thing that we read earlier
today about the climate deniers,

5256
02:23:58,670 --> 02:23:59,940
the climate change expert,

5257
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:02,020
the highest paid guy was fucking.

5258
02:24:02,450 --> 02:24:03,283
I love that.

5259
02:24:03,430 --> 02:24:04,570
It's so beautiful.

5260
02:24:05,170 --> 02:24:05,800
I mean,

5261
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:08,090
things like that make you
wonder about the simulation.

5262
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:09,430
He's like the fake translator.

5263
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:11,200
Find a way to get into the.

5264
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:11,711
Yeah,

5265
02:24:11,711 --> 02:24:12,790
we didn't talk about that yet.

5266
02:24:12,820 --> 02:24:15,220
That's one of the weirdest
things ever on television.

5267
02:24:15,310 --> 02:24:19,300
This guy at the Nelson Mandela
funeral was not only faking,

5268
02:24:19,330 --> 02:24:20,800
being able to translate sign language.

5269
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:25,840
He had done it before and
gotten in trouble before
end 10 years ago was accused

5270
02:24:25,841 --> 02:24:29,350
of murder and this guy has three rape too.

5271
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:30,460
God Damn it.

5272
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:33,310
And he was three feet away
from the fucking president.

5273
02:24:33,311 --> 02:24:33,790
Yeah,

5274
02:24:33,790 --> 02:24:34,380
and no one

5275
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:37,200
translate pretending to translate
all these speeches that I

5276
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:39,640
have a full on schizophrenia
episode apparently.

5277
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:39,901
Well,

5278
02:24:39,901 --> 02:24:40,660
that's what he claims.

5279
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:40,781
Well,

5280
02:24:40,781 --> 02:24:41,351
that's what he says.

5281
02:24:41,351 --> 02:24:41,920
Yeah.

5282
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:44,080
Maybe it's just a con man foot is.

5283
02:24:44,081 --> 02:24:48,520
That was an angry group that burned two
men to death while he was in an angry

5284
02:24:48,521 --> 02:24:50,470
group that burned to mendot death.

5285
02:24:50,860 --> 02:24:51,820
Oh,

5286
02:24:52,690 --> 02:24:53,490
where you at?

5287
02:24:53,490 --> 02:24:54,140
See?

5288
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:54,973
So crazy.

5289
02:24:55,090 --> 02:24:55,923
Where you at?

5290
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:57,573
Where you at?

5291
02:25:00,270 --> 02:25:01,720
I think people got upset about.

5292
02:25:01,721 --> 02:25:03,160
Remember when we talked
about that on the podcast?

5293
02:25:03,161 --> 02:25:06,100
Why do black people talk
on the speakerphone and
people why you go see black

5294
02:25:06,101 --> 02:25:06,520
people?

5295
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:07,353
Because they do.

5296
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:10,180
I'm just saying nothing wrong
with talking your speakerphone,

5297
02:25:10,390 --> 02:25:13,480
but do you tell me why the black people
talking speaker speakerphone like that?

5298
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:14,620
They do that a lot.

5299
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:16,060
They don't do it as much anymore.

5300
02:25:16,061 --> 02:25:19,750
That's kind of dropped off or maybe not
as hanging out as many black people and

5301
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:20,740
we talking like Bluetooth.

5302
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:21,550
No,

5303
02:25:21,550 --> 02:25:23,970
they would have their
phone on speaker so they'd

5304
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,490
be standing there.

5305
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:25,151
What's up dog?

5306
02:25:25,151 --> 02:25:25,990
We do a man

5307
02:25:26,130 --> 02:25:27,660
and then they would talk
like the guy would be like,

5308
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:28,411
Yo man,

5309
02:25:28,411 --> 02:25:28,871
you know me.

5310
02:25:28,871 --> 02:25:29,450
I just telling them.

5311
02:25:29,450 --> 02:25:29,580
Yeah,

5312
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:31,950
and you'd be able to hear both
sides of the conversation.

5313
02:25:33,470 --> 02:25:35,940
They wanted to let you know that they
don't hold their phone up through here.

5314
02:25:36,210 --> 02:25:37,043
That's the new style.

5315
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:38,093
But people don't.

5316
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:40,590
You think that no white girls do it.

5317
02:25:40,591 --> 02:25:43,590
I guess maybe there's
nothing wrong with doing it.

5318
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:43,920
Right.

5319
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:47,320
So what if I hear one side of your
conversation or two sides of your

5320
02:25:47,321 --> 02:25:48,154
conversation?

5321
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:49,290
It doesn't mean fuck all.

5322
02:25:49,291 --> 02:25:50,700
To me it's the same thing.

5323
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:52,230
If I hear you talking on the phone,

5324
02:25:52,231 --> 02:25:54,480
if you you're having this conversation
and I don't hear the guy on the other

5325
02:25:54,481 --> 02:25:55,140
end,

5326
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:55,973
it's not better.

5327
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:57,240
No,

5328
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:58,560
it's just a conversation I'm hearing.

5329
02:25:58,650 --> 02:25:59,520
It's not a bad thing.

5330
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:01,760
So if you choose to have
your friend on speakerphone,

5331
02:26:01,770 --> 02:26:04,890
he talked to them and you want the whole
world to hear the full conversation.

5332
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:05,940
What do I give a shit?

5333
02:26:06,750 --> 02:26:08,190
I don't have a problem with it at all.

5334
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:09,151
It logically,

5335
02:26:09,151 --> 02:26:11,080
to me it's just the same
as one person talking.

5336
02:26:11,081 --> 02:26:12,150
It's not hurting my feelings,

5337
02:26:12,570 --> 02:26:15,280
but I think it's weird that
black people enjoy that,

5338
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:17,190
that they like to put the
phone on speakerphone.

5339
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:19,950
Did so it's like yelling
at the movie theaters.

5340
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:20,791
No,

5341
02:26:20,791 --> 02:26:23,880
that's rude because yelling at the movie
theaters interrupt something for other

5342
02:26:23,881 --> 02:26:24,480
people.

5343
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:25,860
Like you go to see smog,

5344
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:27,570
you want to see a dragon talk,

5345
02:26:27,810 --> 02:26:28,170
you wanna,

5346
02:26:28,170 --> 02:26:29,040
you wanna hear somebody go,

5347
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:29,491
oh,

5348
02:26:29,491 --> 02:26:31,860
you don't fucked up now bill ball.

5349
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,130
Oh Dog.

5350
02:26:34,131 --> 02:26:37,640
Go in that Bilbo dumb motherfucker.

5351
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:38,431
Gonna fry.

5352
02:26:38,431 --> 02:26:40,320
You know?

5353
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:42,420
I think that's rude,

5354
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:45,870
but if you're outside the movies
here and the movie's out and be like,

5355
02:26:45,871 --> 02:26:46,111
Yo,

5356
02:26:46,111 --> 02:26:46,441
dog,

5357
02:26:46,441 --> 02:26:47,640
that's smog was the shit.

5358
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:48,000
Yo.

5359
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:48,990
You just see that shit be.

5360
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:49,291
Yeah,

5361
02:26:49,291 --> 02:26:50,010
man.

5362
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:51,370
That dragon as a motherfucker.

5363
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:52,253
Dude.

5364
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:53,820
Dragon isn't motherfucker to

5365
02:26:55,370 --> 02:26:58,800
high five the way he questions.

5366
02:26:58,801 --> 02:27:00,520
Bilbo Bilbo has got the key.

5367
02:27:00,550 --> 02:27:00,971
Is it bill?

5368
02:27:00,971 --> 02:27:01,200
But yeah,

5369
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:02,033
it was built by Wright.

5370
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:02,970
Who's the.

5371
02:27:02,970 --> 02:27:03,810
Who's the old one?

5372
02:27:03,811 --> 02:27:04,201
Frodo,

5373
02:27:04,201 --> 02:27:05,034
right.

5374
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:06,173
The little dude.

5375
02:27:07,050 --> 02:27:10,430
Little but the other one when the other
ones they wrote it was from the last

5376
02:27:10,431 --> 02:27:10,551
one.

5377
02:27:10,551 --> 02:27:10,950
Right.

5378
02:27:10,950 --> 02:27:12,420
And then bill bowes in the new ones.

5379
02:27:13,070 --> 02:27:13,903
Yeah,

5380
02:27:14,070 --> 02:27:14,903
exactly.

5381
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:15,813
It's a good fucking moving.

5382
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:19,080
Doesn't solve world problems.

5383
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:20,213
It's not a,

5384
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:20,611
it's not gonna.

5385
02:27:20,611 --> 02:27:21,150
Change the world.

5386
02:27:21,150 --> 02:27:21,481
It's not gonna.

5387
02:27:21,481 --> 02:27:22,320
Make anybody cry.

5388
02:27:22,470 --> 02:27:23,700
You're not going to believe for a second.

5389
02:27:23,701 --> 02:27:24,534
It's real.

5390
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:25,590
That's my kind of movie.

5391
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:26,190
Yeah.

5392
02:27:26,190 --> 02:27:27,480
I didn't go see any depressing movies,

5393
02:27:27,481 --> 02:27:27,751
dude.

5394
02:27:27,751 --> 02:27:28,584
I don't wanna see.

5395
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:29,291
No,

5396
02:27:29,291 --> 02:27:29,810
I can't.

5397
02:27:29,810 --> 02:27:30,611
I can't watch that.

5398
02:27:30,611 --> 02:27:31,080
Uh,

5399
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,200
the one I was talking about earlier,

5400
02:27:32,201 --> 02:27:33,820
the Orca and the black one,

5401
02:27:33,821 --> 02:27:35,480
I didn't want to watch the fish.

5402
02:27:36,030 --> 02:27:36,950
That's real

5403
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:38,610
pressing because that's real life.

5404
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:43,820
That's even to me worse than a depressing
movie about a fictional character,

5405
02:27:44,430 --> 02:27:44,881
but I don't.

5406
02:27:44,881 --> 02:27:45,211
I don't want.

5407
02:27:45,211 --> 02:27:46,590
I don't go to the pressing movies anymore,

5408
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:48,300
but I did go see Dallas buyers club,

5409
02:27:49,170 --> 02:27:50,580
but it wasn't really that depressing.

5410
02:27:50,630 --> 02:27:52,020
It was just kind of crazy.

5411
02:27:53,220 --> 02:27:54,720
Is another stock market one,

5412
02:27:54,721 --> 02:27:55,110
right?

5413
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:55,381
No,

5414
02:27:55,381 --> 02:27:55,531
no.

5415
02:27:55,531 --> 02:27:56,520
It's about act,

5416
02:27:56,550 --> 02:28:00,900
about the use of act to
treat aids patients and about
how they just unloaded act

5417
02:28:00,901 --> 02:28:01,400
on people.

5418
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:04,230
Human trials of act that
dropping like flies.

5419
02:28:04,590 --> 02:28:06,780
People using act for cancer medication.

5420
02:28:06,781 --> 02:28:10,060
It was killing more people
than the cancer was and they.

5421
02:28:10,110 --> 02:28:10,980
When AIDS came along,

5422
02:28:10,981 --> 02:28:11,551
they're like liquid,

5423
02:28:11,551 --> 02:28:12,211
just fucking throw,

5424
02:28:12,211 --> 02:28:13,700
act out and we got a bunch of this shit.

5425
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:14,583
Got An infection.

5426
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:15,433
So what was,

5427
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:17,540
what was behind them
wanting to use this shit?

5428
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:22,130
They would make money though the movie
goes into great detail it and the movie

5429
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:23,360
actually has a disclaimer at the end.

5430
02:28:23,361 --> 02:28:24,260
It's quite fascinating.

5431
02:28:24,730 --> 02:28:28,780
They talked about the cocktails were
act was used in a lower dose and helped

5432
02:28:28,781 --> 02:28:29,660
save lives.

5433
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:30,291
Like I said,

5434
02:28:30,291 --> 02:28:30,950
it just like as a,

5435
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:31,820
as an aside,

5436
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:33,380
at the end of the movie in print,

5437
02:28:33,590 --> 02:28:34,000
again,

5438
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,240
we got to say that so we don't get sued,

5439
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:36,060
you know?

5440
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:36,740
Wow.

5441
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:40,820
But the reality of act
is act as toxic as fuck.

5442
02:28:41,510 --> 02:28:46,510
And Matthew mcconaughey's character gets
aids and they put them on act is about

5443
02:28:46,761 --> 02:28:51,761
to die and then he starts eating healthy
and going to this guy in Mexico who's

5444
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:54,440
been kicked out of the United States
practicing alternative medicine.

5445
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,513
I don't want to tell you anymore,

5446
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:56,570
spoiler alert,

5447
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:58,183
but uh,

5448
02:28:58,310 --> 02:28:59,210
it's pretty interesting,

5449
02:28:59,570 --> 02:29:00,403
but it's,

5450
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:01,401
it's the same thing.

5451
02:29:01,401 --> 02:29:02,200
It's all about.

5452
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:02,800
You just said,

5453
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:03,633
of course he did.

5454
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:05,510
Is Twelve going on 12?

5455
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:06,970
Um,

5456
02:29:06,970 --> 02:29:07,910
I mean it's the same thing.

5457
02:29:07,911 --> 02:29:08,990
It's just people making money.

5458
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:10,820
It's just people making money
off a drug that kills me.

5459
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:11,923
They don't care.

5460
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:12,621
They're,

5461
02:29:12,621 --> 02:29:13,700
the movie goes into really,

5462
02:29:13,930 --> 02:29:14,121
really.

5463
02:29:14,121 --> 02:29:18,140
They do a really good job of painting
how the decisions were made and it's

5464
02:29:18,141 --> 02:29:18,980
interesting stuff.

5465
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:20,480
Yeah.

5466
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:21,380
I mean that's the thing.

5467
02:29:21,381 --> 02:29:22,220
When there's money behind it,

5468
02:29:22,410 --> 02:29:23,720
tilted the craziest shit.

5469
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,770
Craziest shit.

5470
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:25,730
Do you have hope,

5471
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:27,200
Lee camp for the human race too?

5472
02:29:27,201 --> 02:29:27,501
I have.

5473
02:29:27,501 --> 02:29:28,260
Hope,

5474
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:29,093
um,

5475
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:31,410
I think it could go one of two ways.

5476
02:29:31,630 --> 02:29:32,451
I think we could,

5477
02:29:32,451 --> 02:29:32,840
uh,

5478
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:33,620
we could,

5479
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:34,200
we're,

5480
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:39,200
we're going down a really ugly path right
now where things like the corporations

5481
02:29:39,681 --> 02:29:40,060
are,

5482
02:29:40,060 --> 02:29:40,530
are,

5483
02:29:40,530 --> 02:29:45,110
are taking over the decisions that
are being made globally and you know,

5484
02:29:45,111 --> 02:29:46,730
things like the Trans Pacific partnership,

5485
02:29:46,731 --> 02:29:50,300
which is the largest trade deal mankind's
ever seen and basically seeds the

5486
02:29:50,301 --> 02:29:53,600
sovereignty of our country to corporations
and it's being pushed forward right

5487
02:29:53,601 --> 02:29:54,290
now.

5488
02:29:54,290 --> 02:29:55,580
And so it has that past.

5489
02:29:55,670 --> 02:29:56,660
It has not passed yet,

5490
02:29:56,661 --> 02:29:58,940
but Obama is trying very
hard to make a pass.

5491
02:29:59,000 --> 02:29:59,833
And,

5492
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:00,231
and,

5493
02:30:00,231 --> 02:30:00,650
uh,

5494
02:30:00,650 --> 02:30:04,070
it's being decided by 600
corporate lobbyists and uh,

5495
02:30:04,140 --> 02:30:04,890
and not.

5496
02:30:04,890 --> 02:30:06,590
They're not allowing the wiki leaks,

5497
02:30:06,591 --> 02:30:06,831
leaks,

5498
02:30:06,831 --> 02:30:07,370
some of it.

5499
02:30:07,370 --> 02:30:08,600
And it's pretty horrible.

5500
02:30:08,810 --> 02:30:09,260
Uh,

5501
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:12,560
it basically says that if a corporation
can't do something here because of

5502
02:30:12,561 --> 02:30:14,180
environmental laws or whatever laws,

5503
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:18,260
they can then sue us in an international
tribunal to get their profits.

5504
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:19,161
And,

5505
02:30:19,161 --> 02:30:19,880
uh,

5506
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:21,920
and I think that if we
keep going down that path,

5507
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:23,390
it's going to be very ugly.

5508
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:24,830
But I think that people are waking up.

5509
02:30:25,310 --> 02:30:26,180
What can they do though,

5510
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:27,350
if they really are waking up,

5511
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:29,000
what do you think could be done?

5512
02:30:29,001 --> 02:30:30,350
Like if you had to look
at the big picture,

5513
02:30:30,351 --> 02:30:35,351
if you look at like the society that
we've sort of found ourselves in today in

5514
02:30:35,661 --> 02:30:36,590
2013,

5515
02:30:36,591 --> 02:30:38,210
you sort of extrapolate from there 30,

5516
02:30:38,211 --> 02:30:39,470
40 years in the future.

5517
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:41,060
How do you see it all working out?

5518
02:30:42,170 --> 02:30:43,580
I mean to make it work out,

5519
02:30:43,581 --> 02:30:44,780
we've got a start.

5520
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:47,780
I think we've got to
start living differently.

5521
02:30:47,781 --> 02:30:48,371
I mean if,

5522
02:30:48,371 --> 02:30:51,290
if every country would he use
resources the way America does?

5523
02:30:51,291 --> 02:30:51,771
We needed,

5524
02:30:51,771 --> 02:30:52,521
what were the numbers?

5525
02:30:52,521 --> 02:30:52,851
Three,

5526
02:30:52,851 --> 02:30:53,181
five,

5527
02:30:53,181 --> 02:30:53,420
earth,

5528
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:55,070
something like that to
be able to sustain it.

5529
02:30:56,090 --> 02:30:59,220
It's we live in an absolutely
unsustainable model and,

5530
02:30:59,300 --> 02:30:59,811
and you know,

5531
02:30:59,811 --> 02:31:02,210
maybe the party will go
on for a few more years,

5532
02:31:02,211 --> 02:31:03,470
but eventually it's got to end.

5533
02:31:03,471 --> 02:31:08,471
And so I think we do have to change the
way we live in a pretty severe sense

5534
02:31:09,261 --> 02:31:09,501
and,

5535
02:31:09,501 --> 02:31:10,310
and it's,

5536
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:13,490
and it's being thrown into
our face as we see every day.

5537
02:31:13,491 --> 02:31:13,811
You know,

5538
02:31:13,811 --> 02:31:15,290
what the fuck.

5539
02:31:15,330 --> 02:31:18,980
And the fact that there's a patch of
plastic twice the size of Texas floating

5540
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:19,751
the Pacific,

5541
02:31:19,751 --> 02:31:20,020
you know,

5542
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:20,731
Fukushima,

5543
02:31:20,731 --> 02:31:21,331
all this shit.

5544
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:22,164
It's,

5545
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:22,970
it's kind of

5546
02:31:22,970 --> 02:31:23,721
bigger than that now,

5547
02:31:23,721 --> 02:31:24,130
right?

5548
02:31:24,130 --> 02:31:24,770
Yeah.

5549
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:27,470
It's like that Hg wells
quote that I love this quote,

5550
02:31:27,471 --> 02:31:32,471
that history is a race between
education and catastrophe and know,

5551
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:35,570
get that out when he was
writing war of the world.

5552
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:40,970
Hundreds when really they hadn't
even begun to fuck the world up yet

5553
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:41,851
and will and,

5554
02:31:41,851 --> 02:31:44,900
and that other gray color will do the
right thing once we've exhausted all other

5555
02:31:44,901 --> 02:31:45,734
options.

5556
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:48,290
I love that one.

5557
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:49,490
That one's great.

5558
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:50,930
That one's fantastic.

5559
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:51,561
You know,

5560
02:31:51,561 --> 02:31:52,940
I'm listening to this,

5561
02:31:52,941 --> 02:31:53,270
uh,

5562
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:57,230
latest hardcore history podcast right
now from you ever listening to Dan

5563
02:31:57,230 --> 02:31:57,500
Carlin's,

5564
02:31:57,500 --> 02:31:58,250
hardcore history,

5565
02:31:58,250 --> 02:31:59,750
no amazing podcasts.

5566
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:04,400
He takes a episodes in history that you
would probably never study and makes

5567
02:32:04,401 --> 02:32:06,800
them really fascinating
and really interesting.

5568
02:32:06,801 --> 02:32:08,270
But it's about world war one.

5569
02:32:08,450 --> 02:32:12,050
What got us into world war one and how
brutal World War One was when the Germans

5570
02:32:12,051 --> 02:32:13,010
invaded the Belgiums.

5571
02:32:13,011 --> 02:32:13,760
And yeah,

5572
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:17,390
it's hard to really believed
that that was 100 years ago.

5573
02:32:17,590 --> 02:32:19,180
True history is mind boggling,

5574
02:32:19,210 --> 02:32:21,160
mind boggling because
what we learned as kids,

5575
02:32:21,161 --> 02:32:21,994
it's nothing.

5576
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:22,800
Yeah,

5577
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:23,620
it's true.

5578
02:32:23,620 --> 02:32:23,771
Yeah.

5579
02:32:23,771 --> 02:32:25,680
You really don't get nearly enough.

5580
02:32:25,720 --> 02:32:26,680
There's not enough time.

5581
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:27,440
There's no,

5582
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:27,980
you know,

5583
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:28,721
you got history.

5584
02:32:28,721 --> 02:32:29,560
How many days a week,

5585
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:30,370
you know,

5586
02:32:30,370 --> 02:32:32,890
how many hours in a day you're
in class for an hour at a time.

5587
02:32:32,891 --> 02:32:33,011
Like,

5588
02:32:33,011 --> 02:32:34,570
what the fuck are you going to learn here?

5589
02:32:34,580 --> 02:32:35,450
Take this at home and,

5590
02:32:35,451 --> 02:32:37,060
and be even more ridiculous,

5591
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:37,571
you know,

5592
02:32:37,571 --> 02:32:40,930
read some pages that you'll never remember
and we'll teach you some shit that

5593
02:32:40,990 --> 02:32:42,100
we've already disputed.

5594
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:43,030
Like Columbus,

5595
02:32:43,030 --> 02:32:43,700
we still have columbus

5596
02:32:43,700 --> 02:32:44,240
stay.

5597
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:44,491
Yeah,

5598
02:32:44,491 --> 02:32:47,310
I know he's the most evil motherfuckers.

5599
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,220
His own his own journals.

5600
02:32:49,221 --> 02:32:52,700
Talk about like chopping people's hands
and noses off if they didn't bring them

5601
02:32:52,701 --> 02:32:53,534
gold,

5602
02:32:54,430 --> 02:32:55,910
his own fucking diaries.

5603
02:32:56,090 --> 02:32:56,590
If you don't,

5604
02:32:56,590 --> 02:32:58,240
if you want to learn about him.

5605
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:00,490
Listened to our podcast with Greg proops.

5606
02:33:00,730 --> 02:33:01,570
Greg proops,

5607
02:33:01,571 --> 02:33:02,860
drops knowledge.

5608
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:03,783
Ladies,

5609
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,650
if you're listening to
that podcast is amazing.

5610
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:06,611
He's so smart,

5611
02:33:06,611 --> 02:33:08,430
but he's also well read and you know,

5612
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:09,700
it's so entertaining.

5613
02:33:09,701 --> 02:33:11,050
So he's talking about Columbus.

5614
02:33:11,051 --> 02:33:15,540
It's like one of the best descriptions
of how fucked up that those people were.

5615
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:16,090
Yeah.

5616
02:33:16,090 --> 02:33:18,040
The scene of them landing,

5617
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:18,760
you know,

5618
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:22,560
in these places where these people had
never seen people like that before and,

5619
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:24,210
and also in the diaries,

5620
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:24,790
he's like,

5621
02:33:24,790 --> 02:33:26,200
it's amazing how generous they are.

5622
02:33:26,201 --> 02:33:28,270
They just walked up and wanted
to be friendly or whatever,

5623
02:33:28,271 --> 02:33:29,990
and then when they
don't bring enough gold,

5624
02:33:29,991 --> 02:33:30,290
he fucking.

5625
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:30,410
Yeah,

5626
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:31,200
chops their heads off.

5627
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:31,351
Yeah.

5628
02:33:31,351 --> 02:33:36,351
They were all like psychedelic people
taken Iowasca and living off the land and

5629
02:33:36,980 --> 02:33:37,561
he's crazy.

5630
02:33:37,561 --> 02:33:39,960
Assholes came by boat starving to death.

5631
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:45,280
He was raping this thing that I'm
listening to about a world war one.

5632
02:33:45,570 --> 02:33:49,140
It's really hard to wrap your head around
these atrocities taking place today

5633
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:52,130
because that what the Germans
did to the Belgiums let me see.

5634
02:33:52,131 --> 02:33:53,100
It's like really crazy,

5635
02:33:53,101 --> 02:33:58,101
like getting his type shit and the idea
that that's the only 100 years ago and

5636
02:33:58,530 --> 02:33:59,161
that's the same.

5637
02:33:59,161 --> 02:34:02,460
The same animals who would call
themselves people today existed.

5638
02:34:02,461 --> 02:34:04,380
Then like the form of us and them.

5639
02:34:04,381 --> 02:34:05,280
They're the same.

5640
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:06,660
There's no difference.

5641
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:09,840
Maybe we have better nutrition
so people like they get bigger,

5642
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:11,063
but other than that,

5643
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:13,363
taller,

5644
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:14,730
well Japanese people,

5645
02:34:14,731 --> 02:34:16,110
clearly they've aided.

5646
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:18,100
Nutrition's aided them

5647
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:18,390
that they,

5648
02:34:18,390 --> 02:34:22,210
the size of Japanese people since the
indoctrination into the western diet,

5649
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:25,900
the they've grown steadily larger
and larger and he was up to like,

5650
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,250
if you go back to like,

5651
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:27,761
you know,

5652
02:34:27,761 --> 02:34:28,780
Rocky Marciano,

5653
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:30,340
who was the heavyweight
champion of the world,

5654
02:34:30,430 --> 02:34:31,840
he was 180 pounds.

5655
02:34:32,830 --> 02:34:34,750
He was like one 89 at his heaviest.

5656
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:35,620
Wasn't big at all.

5657
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:38,790
Do you ever go into like a Ford from
the civil war and the door is like four

5658
02:34:38,791 --> 02:34:39,810
foot five or something?

5659
02:34:39,810 --> 02:34:40,320
Yeah,

5660
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:42,300
old houses you have to duck,

5661
02:34:42,420 --> 02:34:43,253
you know,

5662
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:44,580
like people in the civil war,

5663
02:34:44,581 --> 02:34:47,010
they weighed like 120
pounds and these great,

5664
02:34:47,011 --> 02:34:47,360
you know,

5665
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:49,150
historical figures like A.

5666
02:34:49,150 --> 02:34:49,440
I'm a,

5667
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:50,450
I'm saying Robert e Dot Lee,

5668
02:34:50,451 --> 02:34:51,800
but I don't actually know how tall he was,

5669
02:34:51,801 --> 02:34:53,750
but it's like guys like
Robert e Dot Lee or whatever.

5670
02:34:53,751 --> 02:34:55,160
They're like five foot
tall and you're like,

5671
02:34:55,161 --> 02:34:55,910
what?

5672
02:34:55,910 --> 02:34:56,031
Yeah,

5673
02:34:56,031 --> 02:34:56,421
let's find out.

5674
02:34:56,421 --> 02:34:57,254
How tall was Robert?

5675
02:34:58,070 --> 02:34:58,903
I bet you're right.

5676
02:34:59,360 --> 02:34:59,691
Yeah.

5677
02:34:59,691 --> 02:35:01,320
I think Napoleon was

5678
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:04,670
at least he's known as being a little
dude because he was a little dude amongst

5679
02:35:04,671 --> 02:35:05,211
the little dudes.

5680
02:35:05,211 --> 02:35:06,044
Yeah.

5681
02:35:06,430 --> 02:35:06,641
Yeah.

5682
02:35:06,641 --> 02:35:07,630
How tall was Napoleon?

5683
02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:10,300
Let's find out after Robert e Dot Lee.

5684
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:11,471
Okay,

5685
02:35:11,471 --> 02:35:11,920
let's check.

5686
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:12,753
Let's say yes.

5687
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:13,990
I say he's five.

5688
02:35:13,991 --> 02:35:14,390
Five.

5689
02:35:14,390 --> 02:35:15,223
Do you say

5690
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:16,961
five,

5691
02:35:16,961 --> 02:35:17,740
four,

5692
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:17,951
five,

5693
02:35:17,951 --> 02:35:18,784
one.

5694
02:35:18,930 --> 02:35:19,150
Oh,

5695
02:35:19,150 --> 02:35:20,560
he was actually five.

5696
02:35:20,561 --> 02:35:21,394
10,

5697
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:22,503
zero.

5698
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:23,580
We fucked up.

5699
02:35:24,490 --> 02:35:25,610
How tall was the poet?

5700
02:35:25,660 --> 02:35:26,441
We fucked Abraham.

5701
02:35:26,441 --> 02:35:28,360
Lincoln was Abraham.

5702
02:35:28,361 --> 02:35:29,194
Lincoln was huge though.

5703
02:35:29,430 --> 02:35:29,801
Okay.

5704
02:35:29,801 --> 02:35:30,550
Napoleon,

5705
02:35:30,550 --> 02:35:33,280
I say I say five feet tall.

5706
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:34,773
Forty

5707
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:35,171
four.

5708
02:35:35,171 --> 02:35:35,950
Eight.

5709
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:36,420
Four.

5710
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:36,650
It.

5711
02:35:36,650 --> 02:35:38,280
You don't give a fuck used enterprises,

5712
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:38,730
right?

5713
02:35:38,730 --> 02:35:39,563
Shit.

5714
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:41,180
Huh?

5715
02:35:41,180 --> 02:35:42,520
This is five foot five.

5716
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:43,390
Hmm.

5717
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:44,200
Wait a minute.

5718
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:46,810
That doesn't make any sense because
people were really little back then.

5719
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:48,750
Okay.

5720
02:35:48,750 --> 02:35:49,950
Five point five.

5721
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:51,360
That doesn't mean five and a half.

5722
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:53,360
Five and one slash two inches long by 45.

5723
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,330
Is it in feet?

5724
02:35:54,330 --> 02:35:55,560
Is He Canadian one?

5725
02:35:55,561 --> 02:35:57,090
It says one point six.

5726
02:35:57,180 --> 02:35:57,660
Eight,

5727
02:35:57,660 --> 02:35:58,770
six meters.

5728
02:35:59,970 --> 02:36:02,250
What does that fuck is that?

5729
02:36:02,251 --> 02:36:04,350
Why would you give me that as Siri?

5730
02:36:04,610 --> 02:36:05,140
Oh,

5731
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,130
why does it say five?

5732
02:36:06,150 --> 02:36:07,200
It says five comma,

5733
02:36:07,201 --> 02:36:08,580
five feet tall.

5734
02:36:08,980 --> 02:36:09,813
That's weird.

5735
02:36:10,470 --> 02:36:10,771
Okay.

5736
02:36:10,771 --> 02:36:11,730
This website sucks.

5737
02:36:11,940 --> 02:36:12,090
Alright,

5738
02:36:12,090 --> 02:36:13,410
let's go on wikipedia.

5739
02:36:13,740 --> 02:36:14,071
Okay.

5740
02:36:14,071 --> 02:36:15,240
His height was actually.

5741
02:36:15,241 --> 02:36:15,600
Here we go.

5742
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:15,960
I was.

5743
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:17,730
How tall was an important napoleon?

5744
02:36:21,810 --> 02:36:22,130
Huh?

5745
02:36:22,130 --> 02:36:22,963
Listen to this.

5746
02:36:23,020 --> 02:36:26,770
The British propaganda of the time
promoted the idea that Napoleon was short.

5747
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:27,521
In reality,

5748
02:36:27,521 --> 02:36:29,710
his height was above
average for the period.

5749
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:32,260
Wow.

5750
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:33,610
That is really.

5751
02:36:33,611 --> 02:36:34,750
And through history.

5752
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:36,130
That's exactly what we were talking about.

5753
02:36:36,131 --> 02:36:39,550
The stories of now suggests
than polling was five foot six,

5754
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:41,650
which was often seen.

5755
02:36:41,890 --> 02:36:42,101
Wow.

5756
02:36:42,101 --> 02:36:43,090
That's really interesting.

5757
02:36:44,290 --> 02:36:45,610
That's not that show for back then.

5758
02:36:46,750 --> 02:36:46,961
Yeah.

5759
02:36:46,961 --> 02:36:49,930
It says Napoleon was often
seen with his imperial guard,

5760
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:53,620
which also contributed to the perception
of his being short because the imperial

5761
02:36:53,621 --> 02:36:56,620
guards were above average
height and psychology.

5762
02:36:56,621 --> 02:37:00,370
The Napoleon complex is regarded
as a derogatory social stereotype.

5763
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:01,451
That is interesting.

5764
02:37:01,451 --> 02:37:03,040
So in reality,

5765
02:37:03,070 --> 02:37:05,350
Napoleon was taller than the
average person at the time.

5766
02:37:05,510 --> 02:37:06,430
They were just learned it here.

5767
02:37:06,431 --> 02:37:07,600
First folks,

5768
02:37:07,830 --> 02:37:09,190
and we learned it because the Internet,

5769
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:10,480
Lee camp,

5770
02:37:10,480 --> 02:37:10,991
see you soon.

5771
02:37:10,991 --> 02:37:15,010
That'll be wired into our minds and we
will just think it and then everybody

5772
02:37:15,050 --> 02:37:15,890
will be an annoying

5773
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:18,760
that has all the answers and you'll.

5774
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:20,380
They'll tell you something
like all self righteously,

5775
02:37:20,381 --> 02:37:20,750
and you'd be like,

5776
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:21,670
I know that too.

5777
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:22,640
Duh.

5778
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:23,900
Everyone knows everything I do.

5779
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:24,700
Yeah.

5780
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:25,221
That will help.

5781
02:37:25,221 --> 02:37:25,401
Right?

5782
02:37:25,401 --> 02:37:26,450
When everybody knows everything,

5783
02:37:27,110 --> 02:37:30,240
we can't know if everyone knows every.

5784
02:37:30,250 --> 02:37:31,310
There'd be no grandstanding.

5785
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:33,590
Be Equally Vapid.

5786
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:35,120
When everybody has all information.

5787
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:37,280
We're also going to be able
to tell when anyone's lying.

5788
02:37:37,281 --> 02:37:39,110
We're going to know
everything about everything,

5789
02:37:39,111 --> 02:37:40,460
so there's not any secrets.

5790
02:37:40,461 --> 02:37:40,940
It's awesome.

5791
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:41,810
It's going to be weird.

5792
02:37:41,811 --> 02:37:42,550
It's going to be.

5793
02:37:42,550 --> 02:37:47,110
There'll be a brain scan for lying pretty
soon because we want to be on ecstasy

5794
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:47,660
all day.

5795
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:48,230
They're gonna.

5796
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:51,830
Develop a new ecstasy that doesn't
fuck with your head so you can just be

5797
02:37:51,831 --> 02:37:52,850
annexed to see all the time.

5798
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:53,870
Everyone knows everything,

5799
02:37:53,871 --> 02:37:54,704
but no one cares.

5800
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:56,120
Everyone knows everything about everybody,

5801
02:37:56,121 --> 02:37:57,050
but everyone's an ecstasy.

5802
02:37:57,051 --> 02:37:57,201
So,

5803
02:37:57,201 --> 02:37:57,321
like,

5804
02:37:57,321 --> 02:37:58,154
so what?

5805
02:37:58,250 --> 02:37:59,083
Give me a hug.

5806
02:38:00,250 --> 02:38:01,220
You be alive.

5807
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,130
So happy to be alive.

5808
02:38:03,131 --> 02:38:03,964
Lee Camp.

5809
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:04,491
So,

5810
02:38:04,491 --> 02:38:04,760
uh,

5811
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:05,600
when you go back to New York,

5812
02:38:06,390 --> 02:38:07,640
I leave tomorrow.

5813
02:38:07,641 --> 02:38:09,170
Back to New York.

5814
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:10,063
Yeah,

5815
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:10,700
I,

5816
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:11,533
I've,

5817
02:38:11,810 --> 02:38:12,643
uh,

5818
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:13,130
I've,

5819
02:38:13,130 --> 02:38:13,941
I've enjoyed it out here.

5820
02:38:13,941 --> 02:38:14,230
I've had,

5821
02:38:14,230 --> 02:38:14,660
I mean,

5822
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,110
you know,

5823
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:18,280
whether partially because you gave me
a good show at the ice house one time.

5824
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:20,250
I had good shows that a fake gallery.

5825
02:38:20,251 --> 02:38:20,601
So yeah,

5826
02:38:20,601 --> 02:38:21,070
a lot,

5827
02:38:21,070 --> 02:38:22,610
a lot of cool things happen out here.

5828
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:23,660
Um,

5829
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:24,740
he did a great job with the Ice House.

5830
02:38:24,741 --> 02:38:25,730
That was really funny stuff.

5831
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:27,041
Funny stuff that,

5832
02:38:27,041 --> 02:38:28,490
that crowd is the greatest crowd on earth.

5833
02:38:28,730 --> 02:38:29,480
Smart.

5834
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:30,313
They don't get any better.

5835
02:38:30,510 --> 02:38:31,640
It just really doesn't get any better.

5836
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:34,460
So it's a club from the 1960.

5837
02:38:34,850 --> 02:38:36,110
It spoils you when you,

5838
02:38:36,111 --> 02:38:39,110
when you get to deal with smart
crowds because then you've played the

5839
02:38:39,230 --> 02:38:41,870
neanderthals at a regular club and yeah.

5840
02:38:41,871 --> 02:38:42,471
But again,

5841
02:38:42,471 --> 02:38:43,310
the Yin and the Yang,

5842
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:44,330
it makes you appreciate those.

5843
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:48,570
I think you should always have a shitty
fucking show every now and then just so

5844
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:49,700
you appreciate the good ones.

5845
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:51,320
A bunch of dumb people.

5846
02:38:51,610 --> 02:38:55,910
You should probably schedule shows and
places you suck just so they could really

5847
02:38:55,911 --> 02:38:56,481
appreciate,

5848
02:38:56,481 --> 02:38:57,130
like,

5849
02:38:57,130 --> 02:38:57,350
you know,

5850
02:38:57,350 --> 02:38:58,910
Austin somewhere cool.

5851
02:39:00,170 --> 02:39:00,890
Chicago,

5852
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:01,723
you know,

5853
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:03,940
scheduled places that are
just fucking fill with.

5854
02:39:04,170 --> 02:39:08,680
You're going to get some emails from
the places that aren't those cities in

5855
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:11,750
fucking Weirdos identifying
with a certain patch of dirt.

5856
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:16,150
There's some cool people

5857
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:20,350
if people want to find out,

5858
02:39:20,351 --> 02:39:22,030
but you're standing up there
to catch you somewhere.

5859
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:23,780
Where's the best way to get ahold of you?

5860
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:25,400
Elite camp.net.

5861
02:39:25,401 --> 02:39:28,640
And then the twitters at Lake
Camp and the facebook is Lee camp,

5862
02:39:28,641 --> 02:39:31,520
comedian and [inaudible] dot com.

5863
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:32,511
Uh,

5864
02:39:32,511 --> 02:39:32,781
yeah.

5865
02:39:32,781 --> 02:39:33,201
They used to be.

5866
02:39:33,201 --> 02:39:34,340
It used to be very important site.

5867
02:39:34,570 --> 02:39:35,403
Well,

5868
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:36,760
if they can't,

5869
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:40,370
I have no idea what it means.

5870
02:39:40,610 --> 02:39:42,500
Camp Lee camp makes sense.

5871
02:39:42,590 --> 02:39:44,540
I always figured I might go over
there one day and they'd be like,

5872
02:39:44,541 --> 02:39:44,721
hi,

5873
02:39:44,721 --> 02:39:45,291
I'm Lee camp.

5874
02:39:45,291 --> 02:39:45,651
And they're like,

5875
02:39:45,651 --> 02:39:47,090
that's not legal.

5876
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:50,770
I can't believe you.

5877
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:51,980
Um,

5878
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:52,640
but yeah,

5879
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,590
now I do those videos twice a week.

5880
02:39:54,860 --> 02:39:55,580
Twice a week.

5881
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:56,413
Yeah.

5882
02:39:56,780 --> 02:39:57,530
You're committed.

5883
02:39:57,530 --> 02:39:58,310
I am committed.

5884
02:39:58,310 --> 02:39:58,940
Holy Shit.

5885
02:39:58,940 --> 02:40:00,410
One hundred 80 episodes out there.

5886
02:40:00,470 --> 02:40:02,600
Do you ever find yourself
just to talk about today?

5887
02:40:02,601 --> 02:40:03,770
So it's not.

5888
02:40:03,771 --> 02:40:04,510
There's nothing to talk about.

5889
02:40:04,510 --> 02:40:04,761
I said,

5890
02:40:04,761 --> 02:40:06,350
I don't always know how
to make a funny size.

5891
02:40:06,390 --> 02:40:07,520
It's fucking depressing.

5892
02:40:08,150 --> 02:40:08,571
Yeah.

5893
02:40:08,571 --> 02:40:09,291
So everything.

5894
02:40:09,291 --> 02:40:10,940
So is that like the theme,

5895
02:40:10,941 --> 02:40:13,470
everything has to sort
of have a meaning to it.

5896
02:40:13,490 --> 02:40:15,810
You've got to be pointing something
out and try to make it funny.

5897
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:16,471
Yeah.

5898
02:40:16,471 --> 02:40:18,720
Most of the time I stick
to pretty important topics.

5899
02:40:18,750 --> 02:40:20,010
I will occasionally have some fun,

5900
02:40:20,011 --> 02:40:21,240
like with the Amazon drones,

5901
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:22,080
uh,

5902
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:22,710
that's,

5903
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:24,210
that's less important topic,

5904
02:40:24,211 --> 02:40:28,740
but most of it's a pretty crucial stuff
going on in the world to Amazon drones.

5905
02:40:30,570 --> 02:40:31,920
One day we're going to look back.

5906
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:34,050
If people haven't watched that video,

5907
02:40:34,051 --> 02:40:34,770
they should watch it.

5908
02:40:34,770 --> 02:40:38,070
It's weird that we've shown it on the
podcast for the Amazon drone dropping

5909
02:40:38,071 --> 02:40:38,880
packages off.

5910
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:39,421
A lot of people,

5911
02:40:39,421 --> 02:40:42,090
like the actual science people
thought that they were trolling,

5912
02:40:42,330 --> 02:40:45,930
they were just trying to get a lot of
attention for the possibilities of the

5913
02:40:45,931 --> 02:40:46,240
future.

5914
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:50,730
Like in no way shape or form actually
preparing to use drones to drop packages

5915
02:40:50,731 --> 02:40:50,940
off.

5916
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:52,080
Like that's interesting.

5917
02:40:52,081 --> 02:40:56,430
I think the key would be what the flight
patterns like are they running into

5918
02:40:56,431 --> 02:40:59,040
planes and power lines and
I think they're really low.

5919
02:40:59,070 --> 02:41:01,260
I think they only go like
above buildings and shit,

5920
02:41:01,290 --> 02:41:02,610
which makes them easy to shoot down.

5921
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:07,080
We were saying is that someone's going
to shoot your package happen if you're

5922
02:41:07,081 --> 02:41:08,130
delivering some fucking.

5923
02:41:08,131 --> 02:41:11,190
It's something shooting with prizes.

5924
02:41:12,290 --> 02:41:12,561
Yeah.

5925
02:41:12,561 --> 02:41:13,590
You just make them blow up.

5926
02:41:14,250 --> 02:41:14,551
Meanwhile,

5927
02:41:14,551 --> 02:41:17,790
they'll have 360 degree cameras everywhere
to prevent that because Amazon wants

5928
02:41:17,791 --> 02:41:22,140
to secure the safety of their drones and
I'm sure if your privacy will have no

5929
02:41:22,141 --> 02:41:24,730
interest in the thousands of cameras
flying around our neighborhood.

5930
02:41:25,010 --> 02:41:25,310
Yeah,

5931
02:41:25,310 --> 02:41:25,551
yeah,

5932
02:41:25,551 --> 02:41:25,771
yeah.

5933
02:41:25,771 --> 02:41:27,810
They won't hack those at all.

5934
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:30,630
They're going to realize from this
that people need their freedom,

5935
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:31,681
need this space,

5936
02:41:31,681 --> 02:41:32,580
and they're gonna they're gonna.

5937
02:41:32,581 --> 02:41:33,120
Um,

5938
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:34,140
they're going to give us that.

5939
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:35,063
They're going to

5940
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:37,510
take an agreed this is the positive jail.

5941
02:41:37,830 --> 02:41:38,041
Yeah,

5942
02:41:38,041 --> 02:41:38,311
man,

5943
02:41:38,311 --> 02:41:38,851
this is what I do.

5944
02:41:38,851 --> 02:41:39,391
When I in the shot,

5945
02:41:39,391 --> 02:41:40,650
I tried to end it on a good note.

5946
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:44,940
I'm going to say Amazon's going to
realize that the NSA and all these,

5947
02:41:45,610 --> 02:41:46,230
you know,

5948
02:41:46,230 --> 02:41:47,820
you need to understand
the folly of their ways.

5949
02:41:47,970 --> 02:41:49,420
I think people are slowly waking up,

5950
02:41:49,430 --> 02:41:50,030
but I do.

5951
02:41:50,030 --> 02:41:50,910
I'm positive.

5952
02:41:50,911 --> 02:41:52,880
I consider myself a cynical optimist.

5953
02:41:52,890 --> 02:41:54,450
I view the glass is half full of Shit.

5954
02:41:56,380 --> 02:41:56,931
That's a good one.

5955
02:41:56,931 --> 02:41:57,764
I like that.

5956
02:41:58,130 --> 02:41:58,910
I agree with you,

5957
02:41:58,910 --> 02:41:59,600
I think,

5958
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:00,470
I think it also,

5959
02:42:00,530 --> 02:42:02,330
it could go both ways for sure,

5960
02:42:02,331 --> 02:42:06,650
but right now the possibilities I think
are leaning towards what you're saying

5961
02:42:06,680 --> 02:42:07,820
that people are waking up.

5962
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:08,813
People are,

5963
02:42:08,910 --> 02:42:09,743
it just takes awhile.

5964
02:42:09,860 --> 02:42:14,060
I mean if you look back at what this
hardcore history podcast about the world

5965
02:42:14,061 --> 02:42:16,120
war one and how brutal the,

5966
02:42:16,130 --> 02:42:16,230
uh,

5967
02:42:16,230 --> 02:42:18,160
the Germans were to the Belgiums and how,

5968
02:42:18,250 --> 02:42:18,800
you know,

5969
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:22,430
that wasn't that long ago and you think
of how relatively safe the world is

5970
02:42:22,431 --> 02:42:22,731
today,

5971
02:42:22,731 --> 02:42:23,980
unless you were in Pakistan,

5972
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:25,300
you get hit by a drone or less.

5973
02:42:25,301 --> 02:42:29,240
You're in Afghanistan or a few
like severe hot spots in the world.

5974
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:31,430
It's a lot of fucking safety.

5975
02:42:31,490 --> 02:42:32,210
There's a lot of,

5976
02:42:32,210 --> 02:42:34,210
there's a lot more safety now
than it's ever been before.

5977
02:42:34,220 --> 02:42:36,320
It's a lot more civility now
than it's ever been before.

5978
02:42:36,380 --> 02:42:38,450
And all of the bullshit,

5979
02:42:38,750 --> 02:42:40,040
all the war and all the,

5980
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:44,390
it has to be done like under an air of
fuckery because if you just come out with

5981
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:46,850
the idea of imperialism is
not gonna be accepted anymore.

5982
02:42:46,851 --> 02:42:48,050
You can't just say like,

5983
02:42:48,051 --> 02:42:49,940
the Germans say we're
going to take Belgium now.

5984
02:42:49,990 --> 02:42:51,170
Like America would go,

5985
02:42:51,171 --> 02:42:51,321
well,

5986
02:42:51,321 --> 02:42:51,711
why?

5987
02:42:51,711 --> 02:42:53,030
Why would you go into Belgium?

5988
02:42:53,031 --> 02:42:54,380
They didn't do anything to anybody.

5989
02:42:54,390 --> 02:42:55,670
They barely have an army.

5990
02:42:55,671 --> 02:42:55,821
Like,

5991
02:42:55,821 --> 02:42:56,810
what the fuck are you doing?

5992
02:42:56,970 --> 02:42:58,250
We wouldn't stand for it.

5993
02:42:58,490 --> 02:42:58,671
Well,

5994
02:42:58,671 --> 02:43:00,530
we're going to go through Belgium
because we want to get to France.

5995
02:43:00,710 --> 02:43:01,543
You can't do that.

5996
02:43:01,810 --> 02:43:04,330
Also news get news gets
around the world much quicker.

5997
02:43:04,331 --> 02:43:07,210
It used to be if you wanted
to say somebody did something
in that attack them,

5998
02:43:07,211 --> 02:43:09,070
you could do it and no
one could prove otherwise.

5999
02:43:09,071 --> 02:43:13,840
Whereas now their cell phone cameras in
frequent Syria showing you what's going

6000
02:43:13,841 --> 02:43:14,111
on.

6001
02:43:14,111 --> 02:43:14,591
So yeah,

6002
02:43:14,591 --> 02:43:17,350
that's also one of the reasons
why the idea of false flags,

6003
02:43:17,810 --> 02:43:21,040
which a lot of people don't want
to accept as a historical fact,

6004
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:24,610
but I mean they of have a history
channel talks about the Gulf of Tonkin,

6005
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:25,961
Gulf of Tonkin.

6006
02:43:25,961 --> 02:43:28,690
It's declassified documents
that fake that shit.

6007
02:43:28,691 --> 02:43:31,440
So there's an awareness like
after a certain age we're like,

6008
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:32,333
Eh,

6009
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:32,981
yeah,

6010
02:43:32,981 --> 02:43:33,990
we fucking lie to you.

6011
02:43:34,450 --> 02:43:35,380
Million people died,

6012
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:35,831
whatever.

6013
02:43:35,831 --> 02:43:39,370
Whatever we don't do anymore
because if it's long enough,

6014
02:43:39,371 --> 02:43:41,890
people just don't even notice
that the truth came out like,

6015
02:43:41,910 --> 02:43:42,270
dude,

6016
02:43:42,270 --> 02:43:43,360
that was 60 years ago.

6017
02:43:44,010 --> 02:43:44,840
We don't do that anymore.

6018
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:45,490
Okay.

6019
02:43:45,490 --> 02:43:46,031
Pay Taxes.

6020
02:43:46,031 --> 02:43:46,590
Hippie.

6021
02:43:46,590 --> 02:43:47,010
Do you?

6022
02:43:47,010 --> 02:43:47,980
Do you think freedom is free?

6023
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:49,310
Because freedom is.

6024
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:51,930
You should make that the motto,

6025
02:43:51,950 --> 02:43:52,783
your show for freedom,

6026
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:53,853
freedom and free.

6027
