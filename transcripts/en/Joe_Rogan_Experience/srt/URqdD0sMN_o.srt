1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,440
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,910
your initial questioning is how do people
kind of lose their collective minds?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It every once in a while in history and
a part of the answer is if you start a

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,220
kind of vicious circle of
denouncing people and then
denouncing people who don't

5
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:18,641
denounce,

6
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:23,350
people were denouncing people who
call the whistle on a and other people

7
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:24,370
denouncing people,

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,390
then you can get a kind of circle
of terror where no one wants.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,960
Everyone is so afraid of being
denounced that they wanted to.

10
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:36,961
Now first Stalinist Soviet Union
is another example at Mao's China,

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,530
and that's somehow some,

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,870
one of the ways in which
dictators could often,

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,440
uh,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,530
enforce their power by habits turning
the citizens against each other.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,280
So everyone's denouncing everyone else
out of fear that they'll be an announced

16
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,114
first

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,360
going on right now in North Korea,

18
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:50,870
right?

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,471
Absolutely.

20
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:51,770
Yeah.

21
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:51,921
Yeah.

22
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:52,431
North Korea,

23
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,430
they have this thing where they
each have to report on each other.

24
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:57,320
Like when people are together,

25
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,560
they report on each other for different
things that they did that were

26
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,110
violations of whatever code

27
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,930
they follow up.

28
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,621
Absolutely.

29
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,450
And so governments know how to explain it,

30
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:06,410
but it isn't just governments,

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,940
it can happen spontaneously too.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,830
It's a weird human trait,

33
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:10,250
isn't it?

34
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,671
It is.

35
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,970
It's a combination of a kind of a human
trait and a kind of dynamic when you

36
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:18,300
have a kind of a network
of people and they all are,

37
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,220
are kind of trapped and no one can be
the first person to escape from this

38
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:26,090
vicious circle because they don't want
to be the one who is denounced it,

39
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:29,270
imprisoned and tortured or
whatever the consequence may be.

40
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,340
What do you think,

41
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,571
where do you think,

42
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:33,980
if you think at all about this,

43
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:35,300
where do you think this is all headed?

44
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,370
Like especially in terms of social
media and certainly it's hard to tell,

45
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,110
but I,

46
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,370
you,

47
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,080
you mentioned the possibility that
there's been such a growing recognition of

48
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:50,081
the problem that we will mount a response
that it'll just seem ridiculous of the

49
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:54,640
outrage mob once it's recognized that
there are outraged mobs and virtual

50
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,240
signaling fanatics.

51
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,060
Uh,

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,340
once we have a label for them,

53
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:59,720
once we know that it's a thing,

54
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,501
a,

55
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:04,100
it'll seem so ridiculous that people
will be less tempted to do it.

56
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,281
I mean,

57
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:06,380
that's the optimistic outcome.

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,730
I never really had followed his political
or is his public speaking type life.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,833
So I was like,

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,711
holy crap,

61
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,390
this guy is pretty dialed in.

62
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,600
It's probably the plan it takes
over when he might retire,

63
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,051
he might,

64
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:22,860
I mean he's 40 so he's just getting
his feet under in that world.

65
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,950
And trump dynasty just like
they did with the buses.

66
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,240
That's right.

67
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Just know all of the Clintons claim.

68
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,810
Once you're in there,

69
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,350
it's like,

70
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,370
that's all they want.

71
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,204
Isn't that interesting?

72
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,111
It's crazy.

73
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:34,921
But he,

74
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,000
I would feel.

75
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,620
I mean man.

76
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,510
Well that's a good guy.

77
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,180
I wished that don junior
was running for president.

78
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,481
Yeah,

79
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,160
he's don junior is very reasonable.

80
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,911
Oh Man.

81
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:45,744
Totally,

82
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,011
totally.

83
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:46,571
It's funny if he,

84
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,270
if he says one thing wrong,

85
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,110
one thing,

86
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,940
one slip up of a word,

87
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,540
which by the way,

88
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,920
everybody does every day.

89
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,783
I do it every day.

90
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:53,941
Yeah,

91
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,330
me too.

92
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,690
One,

93
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,690
one slip up of the word Corey
Knowlton one fuck up like that.

94
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
And then this,

95
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,000
I mean,

96
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,990
you see all this,

97
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,300
this magnified,

98
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,350
ridiculous hate that
comes his way and the,

99
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,750
uh,

100
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,160
the attacks against him,

101
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,050
people right now listening to this,

102
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,880
probably yelling at them because
they're fucking Joseph Ford.

103
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,150
Here's the show.

104
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,390
Here's a dose yet.

105
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah,

106
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,270
they,

107
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,560
it's,

108
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,250
it's,

109
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,820
I mean,

110
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,910
it is really hard not to get pissed off.

111
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,370
What's really hard to be unbiased.

112
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,010
It's really hard to have perspective.

113
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,230
I don't think anybody does
a good job as president.

114
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:33,060
I've never seen a single
person to do it well.

115
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,720
But really my drug of choice
was meth back in that day.

116
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,090
That was what I really liked.

117
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,650
That was actually what I was addicted
to at one point and I ended up going to

118
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:48,510
jail and that was what
got me out of addiction.

119
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,300
I didn't realize I was
addicted until I was in jail.

120
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,510
So what made you realize
that when you were in jail?

121
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,620
Uh,

122
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,920
just,

123
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,920
I just couldn't stop thinking
about it and just won it and just,

124
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,340
I mean I didn't get,

125
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,173
have like,

126
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,153
like,

127
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,103
um,

128
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,380
like cold sweats or anything.

129
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,060
I don't think that happens with purse,

130
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,913
but

131
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,660
I mean I was just like,

132
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,100
the couldn't stop thinking about it,

133
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:11,250
man.

134
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,581
I was like,

135
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:11,960
dude,

136
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,850
like just a lot of that
anger was coming out.

137
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:15,361
I was just like,

138
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:15,930
God,

139
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,651
what the fuck?

140
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:17,820
I wanted to fight everybody.

141
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:18,061
I was like,

142
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,200
somebody gave me something,

143
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:19,621
you know?

144
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:20,454
And Wow.

145
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,710
Yeah.

146
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,410
It was just really terrible experience,

147
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:25,590
but probably only lasted
three or four days.

148
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,993
Not even,

149
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,200
maybe not even that.

150
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,040
And then you came out of it.

151
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,611
Yeah,

152
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:32,670
I mean I was just like a
able to accept my fate and,

153
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,643
and deal with it.

154
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,410
What does it feel like to be on meth?

155
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,680
You have to take adderall.

156
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,630
I'd never taken an adderall.

157
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,140
No,

158
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,973
I'm

159
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
pretty similar to adderall.

160
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,190
Right.

161
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,000
It's like adderall.

162
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,670
I mean that's the closest I would say

163
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,170
how many you're high,

164
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,380
but you don't have that
euphoria more than anything.

165
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:56,214
Just to,

166
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,593
excuse me.

167
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,700
Just an extreme sense of euphoria.

168
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,830
Just everything is beautiful.

169
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:03,840
But then men,

170
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,600
soon as you start to
lose that a little bit,

171
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,630
you just itch for it.

172
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,590
So bad man.

173
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:11,424
So bad.

174
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,990
Like you just want it again.

175
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
You don't want to sleep.

176
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:17,320
You like your teeth would be
grinding and you're just like,

177
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,503
oh,

178
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,670
you're just tensing up all your muscles.

179
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:21,640
I got,

180
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,210
I got to get more of that.

181
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,044
You know.

182
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,920
Now when you're working
out at all back then.

183
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,550
No,

184
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,820
no.

185
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,280
Well I take,

186
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,600
well not working out like I should be.

187
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,710
So again,

188
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:31,821
I,

189
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,150
I was angry a lot of times,

190
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:36,870
like I'd be at a party that this was a
common thing I'd be at like a party or

191
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:37,591
just doing drugs,

192
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:38,424
whatever.

193
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,660
And I just started getting look at
everybody like I don't like none of you.

194
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,240
And I would just walk outside
and I would go for a run.

195
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,321
I'd run five,

196
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:46,930
six miles,

197
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,950
come back and be like,

198
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,240
all right,

199
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,530
give me another line or whatever.

200
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,543
Wow.

201
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,990
Yeah.

202
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,580
Um,

203
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,950
you won't run and then come back.

204
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,850
Yeah.

205
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,020
And then sometimes I would,

206
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,250
I would fight people,

207
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,580
you know,

208
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,860
that was very,

209
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,130
very

210
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,990
common if you call that working out.

211
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,770
And we did

212
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,230
this particular time in my life.

213
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,064
I was.

214
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,060
Let me see what we got here.

215
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,250
Billionaire Air Wyatt.

216
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,290
Coke makes shirts about money.

217
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,090
I drank blood this morning.

218
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,601
Wait a minute.

219
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,790
It's their shirts are about money.

220
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,001
Can you.

221
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,170
Can I see those pictures again?

222
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,900
That looks like pink handcuffs with keys.

223
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,040
How has that about money?

224
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,360
Because that's what I paid for.

225
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,170
Paid.

226
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,740
Handcuffed.

227
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,310
Or you are you allowed to show these
videos of him like dancing around and his

228
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:30,830
shirts and it's actually been removed.

229
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,700
It's unavailable.

230
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,593
Somebody's got it.

231
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,171
Dude.

232
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:35,120
It's the weirdest fucking shit.

233
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:35,810
Everywhere.

234
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
He brings his whimsical ideas to
life with his retina blasting shirt.

235
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,134
Brand.

236
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,780
Why at Ingram.

237
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,550
So why at Ingram is his shirt brand?

238
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,271
Yeah.

239
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:50,120
But you got to look up an interview
with him because he says shit like daddy

240
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,160
told me I could do whatever I want.

241
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,480
And I am looking at chick wounds.

242
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,580
That is girl big.

243
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,260
That bigger.

244
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,981
God Damn.

245
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:57,814
I prove

246
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,870
I'm on his side.

247
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,230
If a guy who looks like that can
get a girl who looks like that,

248
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,040
you go,

249
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,873
boy,

250
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,350
what am I a man hater?

251
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,950
Huh?

252
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,870
Am I one of these asshole men?

253
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,190
Shoot other men down.

254
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,200
I'm not a guy.

255
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,930
He didn't even bother even
think once about losing weight.

256
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,761
I'm not either.

257
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:19,730
I'm just using weight.

258
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,820
Look at my Zeros.

259
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm just using that as an example of
the progeny of billionaires like these

260
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:25,350
people are like,

261
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,070
this is something that this shit's
spilling out of the mansions man.

262
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:29,550
Like,

263
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,301
look at this says here,

264
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,370
blessed this oafish,

265
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,720
coke air and his hideous shirts.

266
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,170
He's a flamboyant guy and
now we're talking about them.

267
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:37,681
Good for you,

268
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:38,160
sir.

269
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,993
I'm sorry.

270
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,983
He's smart.

271
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,440
He's.

272
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,440
He looks like the guy who sold
the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.

273
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,320
Remember the dude?

274
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,040
What's his name?

275
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,600
The guy from the Newman Newman.

276
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,740
He looks like Newman and he's
banging a 10 man to get the fuck out.

277
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:55,950
He also looks like he's been spending a
lot of time in the skull and bones come

278
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,813
coughing.

279
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,390
I'm not satisfied.

280
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,340
I haven't absorbed all the
energy of the come into my being.

281
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,671
So you.

282
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:18,730
You take their blood and then they.

283
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,920
What do they find it to the lab?

284
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,300
You want to look at cortisol levels,

285
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,110
how the stresses you want to
look at white blood count,

286
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,360
see if they're fighting any infections.

287
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,091
Uh,

288
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:26,350
you know,

289
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,570
there's always a no in her case,

290
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:29,404
there's always something,

291
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,970
a lot of the animals are in fact on
value and a lot of different sites.

292
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,890
Tons.

293
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,220
What that,

294
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,560
that is like rampant use in,

295
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:35,910
uh,

296
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,130
in,

297
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,490
in,

298
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,110
in the,

299
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,880
in aquariums.

300
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,750
What volume.

301
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,080
Yeah.

302
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,481
I'm reeling.

303
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,310
Accused me of stealing value and in fact,

304
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,031
in the lawsuit as well,

305
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,870
which is absolutely not true because this.

306
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,010
Is this used everywhere or
is it just the greenland?

307
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:48,910
Greenland.

308
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,743
Seaworld everywhere.

309
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:50,860
Yes,

310
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,580
absolutely.

311
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,480
Like dolphins.

312
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,860
Dolphins are on volume all the time.

313
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:54,160
Sure.

314
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,760
When I was,

315
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,350
when I was,

316
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,400
when I left marine land,

317
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,990
I had the agreement again.

318
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,860
I left fairly amicably
considering the situation,

319
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:02,250
but you know,

320
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,270
I wanted to play my cards right.

321
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,310
And murraylands owner called me back
in specifically to help a dolphin.

322
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,450
And it was the theater of course,

323
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,160
the waste that was in the daily mail.

324
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,690
Let's,

325
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,523
what's the other one?

326
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,290
The Dodo.

327
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,821
The Dodo.

328
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,241
A good one.

329
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:15,661
Buzzfeed.

330
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,494
Let's go with buzzfeed.

331
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,530
Seaworld puts its whales on valium
volume like drug documents say Jesus.

332
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:22,170
Fuck.

333
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,010
Those documents are from a lawsuit
between marine land and sea world where

334
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,560
seaworld sued marine land.

335
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,620
See on Ontario at seaworld sued marine.

336
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:30,771
Yeah.

337
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,130
The old Benzodiazepines,

338
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm telling you,

339
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,810
wow.
