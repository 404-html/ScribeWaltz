1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,820
And we're live.
Hello,

2
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:07,654
Michael Shermer road.
You could see with your pile of your 

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:12,100
writing,
what could you got?

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,120
Their moral arc?
Heavens on earth.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,280
Okay.
You just have to take magazine.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,173
It's the latest issue.
Why is there something rather than 

7
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:21,574
nothing?
We'd like to tackle the little 

8
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:23,760
questions.
That's a deep one.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,380
You've dealt with this on the show.
Yeah.

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,860
Too much.
It's a,

11
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,440
that's one that just,
you know,

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,280
when you're in traffic and you know,
what is this?

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,040
When you have someone like neil or Sean 
Carroll or,

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,750
or,
uh,

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,460
Lawrence Krauss talking about this,
it's like,

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,470
Whoa,
I'm not a physicist.

17
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,910
I'm a social scientist.
So for me,

18
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:42,010
I come at it like,
what do you mean by this word?

19
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:42,844
Nothing.
Because most of us have this idea of 

20
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:44,994
what I mean.
Oh No.

21
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,670
In physics it means this other thing 
like,

22
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,663
okay,
well I think our limited understanding 

23
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:52,000
of what they're talking about.

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,853
Like when I see those guys writing down 
on legal papers with all that scritchy 

25
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:56,584
scratchy,
crazy looking very fake alien language 

26
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,510
and mathematics.
Like,

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,740
thank God you guys are out there.
Well,

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,870
I opened heaven on earth with.
Imagine yourself dead and you know,

29
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:08,820
most people go,
well,

30
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,663
you know,
I see myself in the casket and my 

31
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,020
friends and family around a hopefully 
their morning.

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,680
No,
you wouldn't see anything.

33
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,590
Of course you,
you're dead to imagine anything.

34
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:20,770
You have to be conscious and alive so 
you can't even picture being dead.

35
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,970
So he can't picture not existing.
And it would be the same thing.

36
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,890
Imagine there's no universe.
Okay,

37
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:28,120
I see blackness.
No,

38
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,130
there's no blackness.
I mean,

39
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,290
nothing would literally be not just no 
light,

40
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,630
but no,
no perception of darkness,

41
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,310
nothing.
Not even nothing.

42
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,353
I was going through instagram the other 
day and there was this one person who 

43
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:45,610
was talking about the purpose of life 
and when you die,

44
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:46,690
what's going to happen?

45
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,050
And I immediately just started laughing.
I'm like,

46
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:54,130
you don't know how he's saying this,
like when you die,

47
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,600
what happens?
And he was like,

48
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:59,530
one of them spiritual type characters is
just kind of a huckster,

49
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,350
is a lot of spiritual hucksters out 
there these days.

50
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,100
There are.
Yes.

51
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,933
The,
in the nineties we debunked all those 

52
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,790
psychics talking to the dead.
That was,

53
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:07,500
uh,
that,

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,520
that hasn't been too popular in recent 
years,

55
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:10,354
but that was a big thing,
but caught onto that little earpiece 

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,590
thing,
the earpiece or just the cold reading.

57
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,600
I see a father figure as a grandfather,
father,

58
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,680
uncle,
friend of the family,

59
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:21,514
you know,
you can.

60
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,770
And uh,
he saying something about,

61
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,090
um,
you know,

62
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,220
it's okay for you to forgive yourself.
Oh,

63
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:29,830
okay.
Well where was the,

64
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:32,860
will he hid his will somewhere?
Where is that?

65
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,650
Because that's what we want to know is 
that ring he had.

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,513
Whereas if you're just vague enough,
I mean like horoscopes of you're just 

67
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,700
vague enough people who are like,
oh my God,

68
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:44,560
it's right all the time.
It's always right.

69
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,870
Like,
that's not even a real horoscope.

70
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,023
If you really want to pay attention to 
actual astrology that you have to know 

71
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,990
the date you were born,
that time you were born.

72
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,360
It's not just the month of August,
you know,

73
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,770
it's like they got to know,
they want to know or evening,

74
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,690
you know,
what do you think about all that stuff?

75
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,730
It's all bunk,
is it?

76
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,160
Yeah.
Yeah,

77
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,620
yeah.
Why has it been around so long?

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,720
Well,
because the,

79
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,930
well it's called the barnum effect where
pt Barnum,

80
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,990
you just offer something for everybody.
So if you make a general enough,

81
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,600
you know,
I,

82
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,433
I sent you an intelligent,
wise person that people really enjoy 

83
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:19,864
your company and you like going to 
parties and being with other people and 

84
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:25,160
yet you liked the quiet solitude of a 
walk on the beach and when people go,

85
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,070
yeah,
that is so me.

86
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,563
Well,
I've pretty much described every 

87
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,000
scenario.
You can have your alone,

88
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,834
you're with people.
But it's one of those things where if 

89
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,710
you talk to someone who is an actual 
believer in astrology,

90
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,650
like they,
they are so convinced.

91
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,843
I got a friend of mine who was trying to
tell me that he makes all of his 

92
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,160
decisions based on consulting with his 
astrologer.

93
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,790
Well Reagan,
Nancy Reagan for his travel.

94
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,280
After he was shot,
she got real paranoid about that.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,833
Well,
so part of the problem is the 

96
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,603
astrologers and psychics are themselves 
remembering their hits and forgetting 

97
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,690
their misses,
the confirmation.

98
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,620
And so I knew a psychic or a magician 
who was working.

99
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:10,621
The psychic friends network
back in the nineties when it's hard,

100
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:13,060
it's hard to make a living as a magician
doing kids' parties.

101
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,440
They all want to have their own biggest 
show,

102
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,200
but only a few people get that.
So you got to do something on the side.

103
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,920
So this guy was doing psychic friends 
network and uh,

104
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,390
he told me all about it.
They gave him a book,

105
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,224
a three ring binder and you know,
here's the kinds of things you should 

106
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,940
say and you know,
people are calling for love,

107
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:28,601
health,
money,

108
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,730
career questions.
So you can spend 20,

109
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,790
30 minutes at three 95 a minute just 
going through there.

110
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,623
You know,
I sent you in a relationship right now 

111
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,390
and one of these more committed than the
other.

112
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,520
Tell me about that.
Ten minutes later,

113
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,354
you know,
there's still talking and you're 

114
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,630
thinking about travel.
You're not happy with your job.

115
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,670
There's some financial stress in your 
life right now.

116
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,920
And then he told me about stuff like,
now go get a crystal and then a candle.

117
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,754
I want you to set it up here on your 
desk and this would go on and on for 

118
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,890
hours and they charge by the hour and 
they chose what they are.

119
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:57,724
So one of the problems that psychic 
friend networks had was people were not 

120
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,230
paying their phone bills because they 
come back on $800 phone.

121
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,700
They would just not pay it.
So the phone companies crackdown down on

122
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,260
the psychic friends network company 
going,

123
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,094
hey,
this is getting out of hand that people 

124
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:11,350
aren't paying their bills.

125
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,230
So they had to ratchet it back a little 
bit.

126
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,720
This right.
They would do it through the phone.

127
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,800
That's interesting.
Yeah.

128
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,270
They wouldn't get a credit card from 
you.

129
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:20,740
They would just stay on the line with 
you.

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,633
Right.
So he told me that when he first 

131
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:23,434
started,
he got like sixty cents on the minute a 

132
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,213
for three 95 at that per minute.
But then they bumped it up as he got 

133
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,250
more experience and kept them on the 
line longer.

134
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,084
They gave them bonuses,
now you get a dollar per minute or 

135
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,780
whatever.
How is that not illegal?

136
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,400
I mean,
he's not even a psychic,

137
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,263
shouldn't you have to be a doctor?
You have to go and you've got to go to 

138
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,530
medical school.
We've got to get a degree.

139
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,883
Shouldn't.
There's a interesting history there 

140
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:47,854
because in New York City for example,
it was difficult to outlaw like the 

141
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,694
three card Monte guys on the sidewalk 
with the cardboard because it's just 

142
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,260
kind of a game right now.

143
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,470
Now it would be illegal to sell 
fraudulent stocks or something like that

144
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,150
or sell a product that's advertised as a
health product when it's not,

145
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,984
but if say in that case it's under food 
rather than drugs or say no health 

146
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:11,744
products like vitamins are under 
different standards than say medical 

147
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,484
drugs.
I'm a psychic is more like an 

148
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,634
entertainer.
So this is for entertainment purposes 

149
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,440
only,
so we can do whatever we want as opposed

150
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,870
to a medical doctorate.
That's dispensing advice.

151
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,760
So in medical doctor is a bad example.
Maybe I shouldn't say that engineer,

152
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,660
but the point is like,
if you're going to work as a psychic,

153
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,233
like on a psychic network,
if you have a business of selling 

154
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,070
psychics,
like you should be able to.

155
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:45,050
You have to exhibit some sort of psychic
something.

156
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,183
Well,
they can't,

157
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,820
uh,
you know,

158
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,680
under controlled conditions they always 
fail.

159
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,543
There's nothing that's ever been done.
Now what about the one thing that I've 

160
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,250
read that a statistically more people 
can recognize that people are staring at

161
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,154
them,
like when they're looking at you from 

162
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,160
behind that horseshit?
Well,

163
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,520
it's not been.
It's not been consistently replicated.

164
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,070
So is it possible some people with a 
certain sensitivity can detect?

165
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,540
Okay.
So one explanation,

166
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,374
the skeptics explanation is that if I'm 
in a say a starbucks or something and I 

167
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,000
kind of have a sense that people are 
talking about maybe looking at me and,

168
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,843
and,
and I look and that catches somebody's 

169
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,630
eye and they turned to me and I think,
oh,

170
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:26,600
that person's looking at me or vice 
versa.

171
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:29,050
I'm looking at them and then they send 
something or whatever.

172
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:30,950
So there could be some element of chance
to that.

173
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,160
Now I'm the guy that does this,
rupert sheldrake,

174
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,083
um,
you know,

175
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,923
he believes that it's actually some kind
of like a psychic power through the 

176
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,590
medium like that when I'm looking at 
you,

177
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,350
something's coming out of my eyes and 
particularly in your neck.

178
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,110
So that's morphic resonance,
morphic resonance.

179
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:48,944
Now Richard Wiseman,
a British like experimental 

180
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:51,824
psychologist,
he's tried to replicate that and he 

181
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:55,250
always fails.
And then this other woman,

182
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:56,084
Marilyn Schlitz,
she also tried to replicate it and she 

183
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:02,060
was able to replicate some of it.
So there may be an experimenter bias.

184
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,983
It's not clear if it's the skeptics that
are biased or the believers that are 

185
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:08,180
bias,
but in that case it's best to just say,

186
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,210
you know,
we don't know it.

187
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,243
So the default position,
the null hypothesis is that it's not 

188
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:16,910
true until you prove otherwise.
And that's a difficult one to prove.

189
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,310
Now if they say,
if I say,

190
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,690
well,
why is the effect so subtle?

191
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:21,524
Why can't you go to Vegas and become a 
millionaire gambling or play the stock 

192
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:25,934
market?
You know,

193
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,100
we know traders just need a tiny,
you know,

194
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,180
one point point,
oh,

195
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:31,070
one percent advantage over the other 
traders,

196
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,360
whatever,
and they can make a lot of times it just

197
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,210
psychic abilities.

198
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,480
Psychic abilities is a very broad term,
right?

199
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:39,740
It's almost like saying drugs because 
like certain drugs that put you to sleep

200
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,830
and certain drugs that make you hyper,
they have very different effects.

201
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:43,664
So saying psychic ability,
like maybe have the ability to see if 

202
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,724
someone's looking at you,
but you don't have the ability to pick 

203
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:49,370
the lottery.
Right?

204
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,313
Uh,
so the hard part in testing psych exist 

205
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,800
to pin down what exactly are you saying 
you could do?

206
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,653
Right?
And that that's where it gets pretty 

207
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,654
fuzzy.
So these like why is it legal for the 

208
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,080
phone psychics?
Because they,

209
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,790
you can't pin them down.
If somebody says,

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,770
look,
I'm just giving relationship advice,

211
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,633
why is that illegal?
If I say like the Tony Robbins Netflix 

212
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,020
documentary,
I'm not your guru,

213
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,883
which is basically I am your guru.
He has that moment in this huge 

214
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:14,994
auditorium.
There's like 3000 people there and he 

215
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:19,950
gets this woman up on stage and she's 
got relationship problems.

216
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,960
He says,
do you have your phone feels yeah,

217
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,940
take out your phone and call him right 
now.

218
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,403
And she talks her through dumping this 
guy onstage on the phone and he's at 

219
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:30,630
work or something.
He's like,

220
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:31,464
what?
And then she hangs up and everybody's 

221
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,810
happy that she did this.
Now is that a good thing or a bad thing?

222
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,210
I have no idea.
It's great for show business,

223
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,090
but what if you know,
so how the fuck.

224
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,983
I mean that seems crazy.
Like how do you know what kind of 

225
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,294
relationship they really have.
Now somebody that talked to both of 

226
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,001
them,
right?

227
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,420
Wouldn't you?
Somebody that I brought this up at a,

228
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,590
at an event recently,
a party and somebody said,

229
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,760
oh,
I know the backstory.

230
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,790
His staff had been working the audience 
and they,

231
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,050
they knew all about her and the 
relationship and it was about to go sour

232
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,240
anyway,
so we brought her up.

233
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,291
It's like,
okay,

234
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,660
so this is the thing,
what you see the psychics on tv,

235
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:09,390
there's a lot of stuff you don't see.
They work the audience,

236
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,200
they know,
people fill out like the psych,

237
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,040
the faith healers,
they fill out prayer cards,

238
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,520
they put their name and address and 
their ailment and then,

239
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,393
you know,
the faith healers have a little earbud 

240
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,230
in there and they're listening to the 
person in the back reading,

241
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,900
okay,
here's the person they have clocked coma

242
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,940
or whatever and you hear him calling 
this out.

243
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:28,300
So,
uh,

244
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
so there's a lot of that that we don't 
see.

245
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,080
The Anthony Robbins is not claiming any 
kind of psychic ability.

246
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:34,914
He just,
he's just trying to provide positive 

247
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,260
path for improving your life.
And if you're in a bad relationship,

248
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:41,094
that would be a positive path.
Let's get out of that relationship and 

249
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,584
then move forward with it with emotion 
and power and love and fucking probably 

250
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:53,250
throw a karate kick and get everybody 
pumped up and jump around a little Bobby

251
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,083
Brown headphones on.

252
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,500
But he's,
he's a showman too.

253
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,161
Yeah,
that's right.

254
00:10:59,161 --> 00:10:59,994
So,
but,

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,980
but my point is that the psychic could 
say the same thing.

256
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,360
Look,
I'm just dishing out at.

257
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,350
I don't know.
I mean it,

258
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,200
it's weird to put him in that category,
right?

259
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,300
Because he's just trying to get people 
excited.

260
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,190
He,
I think he does some good.

261
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,840
I really do because he did me some good 
when I was 21 years old.

262
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,740
I used to listen to his,
I think it was called unlimited power.

263
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,663
I think that was the name of the book 
and I listened to it on audio cassette 

264
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:23,544
by the pool was shitty apartment that I 
was living in when I was trying to be a 

265
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:26,664
standup comedian and it helped me.
He had some really good advice in terms 

266
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,094
of setting goals and in terms of like 
the way you approach things and look at 

267
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:35,784
things.
But I agree all of that in any of these 

268
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,970
self help books,
Jockos books or Amy Alkon.

269
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,740
There's a lot of stuff that very similar
to what Tony Robbins.

270
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,820
A issues and.
Okay.

271
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:48,654
That makes sense.
Set goals and be motivated and think 

272
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,803
positive.
Maybe air a little bit on the side of 

273
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,010
over optimism

274
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
so you can push through the failures,
but don't be blind because maybe it's 

275
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,550
certain times it cut and run and change 
course in your life.

276
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:03,100
Something like that.
The hard part is getting,

277
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,260
getting is studying that which,
you know,

278
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,320
experimentally which are the best 
techniques versus others.

279
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:12,010
And um,
there was a guy wrote a book called Sham

280
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,040
s h a m self-help actualization movement
and he was the head guy for Rodale press

281
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,760
that publishes these self help books.
Um,

282
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,673
and so his takeaway on in this book was 
that the number one predictor of people 

283
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,234
who will buy,
sell up books are people who already 

284
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,160
bought self help books and they continue
buying them.

285
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,530
So if you say,
does it work?

286
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,000
Well,
it works.

287
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:37,750
If you work at sort of consistently like
you gotta listen to the tapes like every

288
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:38,584
weekend or every low moment.
It's not like taking the pill and your 

289
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:42,484
cancer's gone.

290
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,883
Uh,
you have to kind of keep practicing it 

291
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,490
as this is a lifestyle change for it to 
work.

292
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,020
Yeah.
That's um,

293
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,040
and also what do you mean by work?
So Tony goes into a corporation and they

294
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,650
get a bump a,
this is an example in this book to get a

295
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,980
bump in sales.
So they get the salesmen all motivated,

296
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:02,110
they hit the phones on Monday morning,
you know,

297
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:05,740
within two weeks their sales are kind of
back to where they were.

298
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,993
So you get.
So they got to bring the self help guy 

299
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,590
back in every month or so to keep them 
super motivated.

300
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,070
Well you've got to give them some sort 
of incentive to state,

301
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,630
state pumped,
right?

302
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,763
I mean some financial incentives,
like one of those I'm old school 

303
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:24,250
phrases.
The inspiration is like bathing.

304
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:26,920
It works,
but you have to do it regularly in order

305
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:27,970
for it to be effective.

306
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,030
I like that.
I mean bathing works,

307
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,670
but it doesn't mean you like hey,
two months later a smell like shit.

308
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,873
It works.
Yeah.

309
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,761
Daily.
Yeah.

310
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,890
You have to do it all the time.
It's like saying why?

311
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,240
Why can't the NFL teams play the whole 
game like the last two minutes?

312
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,980
Because it's so exciting.
The two minute drill,

313
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,590
because they can't do it physically.
You can't keep that up.

314
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,550
Yeah,
yeah.

315
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,383
Well,
I think you could physically keep up 

316
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,810
that enthusiasm that Anthony Robbins 
provides,

317
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:53,644
but you have to be either you have to 
have some sort of an office environment 

318
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:03,010
that is an incredibly enthusiastic to 
the point where you guys have engineered

319
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:05,830
this environment where everybody's 
pumped up,

320
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,263
but that's going to be a being that 
doesn't leave a whole lot of room for 

321
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:10,534
the individual to be themselves.
I feel like that would be terrible to 

322
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:13,924
work for a place like that where 
everywhere you go there's motivational 

323
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:16,924
sayings and people were chanting things 
in the hallway and everybody's just got 

324
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,240
energy at 10.

325
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,960
It's a Co,
you know,

326
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,803
that's.
That's what a guy like anthony robins 

327
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:30,190
will provide you for a short burst.
We just hope that some of it sticks.

328
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:30,941
Right?
Well,

329
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,640
this is amy elkanns book.
Unfuck allergy.

330
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:34,474
It's great,
but yeah,

331
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,150
she calls these small wins or whoever 
calls him small wins,

332
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,030
like make your bed in the morning or 
shave or whatever,

333
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,390
or like Jockos little twitter posts at 
4:30 AM.

334
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,220
Yes.
Now I'm never getting up at 4:30,

335
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,054
but when I get up at 6:30,
we'll occasionally like five this 

336
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,980
morning for the morning ride.
That leaves at 7:00 AM.

337
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:54,020
I get up at 5:30,
so I'm not happy getting up at 5:30,

338
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:54,561
but I think,
okay,

339
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,394
Jocko has been up an hour.
He's already worked out already done 

340
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:58,791
working out.
Okay.

341
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,410
I can't really complain.
Come on.

342
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,290
Shermer giggling that,
that kind of little thing.

343
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,540
This is Jordan Jordan Peterson point of 
the,

344
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,600
you know,
make,

345
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,480
get your life in order.

346
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,670
What is he talking about?
Just stand up straight.

347
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,130
Make your bed,
clean your room.

348
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,260
What's he talking about?
He's talking about these little wins,

349
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,094
like if you can do that,
then the next thing that's a little 

350
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:22,700
harder comes a little easier and also 
those things that are in the background.

351
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:23,534
If you know that your your life as a 
master cars filled with fast food 

352
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:27,470
wrappers,
you're,

353
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,761
you know,
you're,

354
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:28,594
you're,
you've got that thing that you haven't 

355
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,740
taken care of in the back of your head 
that,

356
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,360
that will,
that that's going to disrupt.

357
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,240
It's going to be flowing in your 
thoughts.

358
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,070
For the most part,
it'll be a distraction.

359
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,173
Right,
so those little things apparently do 

360
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:43,844
matter.
There's a theory of crime called the 

361
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:50,291
broken windows theory that is favored by
criminologists to explain the decline.

362
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,910
The crime decline in the nineties.
What happened in New York City,

363
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,560
they started cleaning up the graffiti.

364
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,560
They started catching the turnstile 
jumpers.

365
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,800
They started cleaning up the streets.
They started boarding up.

366
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:06,380
Windows has no broken windows or 
replacing the windows.

367
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,693
The theory is that if there's a signal 
in society that no one's paying 

368
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:13,160
attention,
there is no law and order here.

369
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,950
There are no rules or norms.
Do whatever the fuck you want.

370
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,433
You're going to get more crime if you 
send the signal through little things 

371
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,474
like we're not gonna,
allow graffiti on this wall anymore and 

372
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:25,610
no more turnstile jumpers in the subways
and so on.

373
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,530
And so when,
when that happened,

374
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,990
then there was a trickle down effect and
then crime decline.

375
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:30,824
So that's the most popular theory for 
that and I think there's something to 

376
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:34,521
that.
Yeah,

377
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,354
that makes a lot of sense.
And what they did with New York City is 

378
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:41,290
really fantastic if you,
if you go back to when I was a kid and I

379
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,780
traveled to New York City the first time
when I saw times square,

380
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:47,000
I guess it was probably like 18 or 19.

381
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,400
I was like,
look at this fucking crazy place.

382
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,200
Like this is madness.
And you know,

383
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:55,430
you see it in movies and it's just 
always this horrific scene.

384
00:16:55,431 --> 00:17:00,431
It's always peep shows and hookers and 
pimps and thugs and drug dealers.

385
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,890
And you go there now and it's like a 
mall threw up.

386
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,550
It's like a giant neon mall of America 
Time Square.

387
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,743
If you took a person,
if you grabbed a guy from like 1988 and 

388
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:16,100
you put them in a time machine,
said,

389
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:16,934
hey man,
I'm going to bring you 30 years in the 

390
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:21,410
future and you're going to see New York 
City the way it looks.

391
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,520
Then like,
what do you expect?

392
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,271
Like,
oh my God,

393
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:25,070
it's going to be like,
like blade runner.

394
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:25,904
People are going to be shooting people 
and selling body parts and now you get 

395
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,010
there and it's like Guy Fieri Aries 
restaurant.

396
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:31,844
And two huge,
gigantic lcd screens and then there's 

397
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,780
some people that would long for the old 
days,

398
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,140
the dirty seediness Lenny Bruce talked 
about,

399
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,670
you know,
and he lived there.

400
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,050
It's like,
I mean,

401
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,963
well that has a certain charm,
I guess if go going into the nightclubs 

402
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,200
or whatever,
but the surrounding daytime neighborhood

403
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:52,970
or something,
you,

404
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,550
this isn't where you want to live rather
live in the vomited mall.

405
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,560
Well,
I'm not crazy about that either,

406
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,610
but uh,
but,

407
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,453
so there's a reason why cities have 
certain restrictions on those kinds of 

408
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,350
stories coming in in a crappy 
neighborhood like downtown,

409
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,213
old town.
Pasadena now is kind of a hip place to 

410
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,224
go.
But in the seventies when I went to the 

411
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,811
ice house,
but,

412
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:13,830
you know,
back in the day,

413
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,570
in the seventies,
uh,

414
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,404
just as a spectator and uh,
but it was terrible down there and 

415
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,180
wasn't really.
Oh yeah,

416
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,020
it was a dump.
I mean,

417
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:23,370
there was.
Oh,

418
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,151
terrible.
Yeah,

419
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,740
it was horrible.
The word was,

420
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,620
according to my friend Bob Fisher,
who owns the icehouse,

421
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,310
he said that what it was was in the 
early days of Hollywood,

422
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,330
the producers would all buy homes in 
Pasedena.

423
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,450
These,
they have these beautiful old estates in

424
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,284
Pasadena,
but the stars would all live in the 

425
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,124
Hollywood hills,
so they would all be just boozing it up 

426
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,034
and partying down in the Hollywood hills
and the producers like let those crazy 

427
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:54,450
animals go have added in the hills.
We're going to back out a little bit and

428
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:55,284
they,
they establish that community out there 

429
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:57,690
in Pasadena.
Right?

430
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,670
Right.
So to turn it around,

431
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,250
like one of the key things,
uh,

432
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,930
a mall can do is get an what they call 
an anchor store.

433
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,650
Someone like a saks fifth avenue,
somebody that's really respectable,

434
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:10,080
big.
And then you can call the other guys,

435
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:10,381
go,
look,

436
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,790
we've got saks fifth avenue.
Oh,

437
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,100
you got sex because they haven't even.
Then I can be next to him.

438
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:17,610
And then it starts going and then little
by little,

439
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:20,190
each of them cleans up their 
neighborhood a little bit more.

440
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,020
And pretty soon you end up with old 
town.

441
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:22,830
Pasadena,
now,

442
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,663
well I was telling you guys before I had
an issue today where my credit card got 

443
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,200
robbed and uh,
you know,

444
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,030
whatever credit card fraud,
someone got a hold of my number,

445
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,073
which is really,
that's the one thing that people worry 

446
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,150
about the most about shopping online.
Right?

447
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,190
But I guess that could kind of happen 
everywhere,

448
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,653
but you got to think that if there's 
anything that has changed malls more 

449
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,584
than anything,
it's got to be the ability to just shop 

450
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,254
online on your phone like Amazon.
That the fact that they figured that 

451
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:53,394
out.
I remember when Amazon came out and it 

452
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:56,400
was just a bookstore.
I was like,

453
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,350
who the fuck is going to buy books 
online?

454
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,240
You can just go to the bookstore.
This is ridiculous.

455
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,340
What a stupid business.
Meanwhile,

456
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:06,570
that guy has more money than any human 
on the planet is poor bastards.

457
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,403
Getting divorced too.
I heard last night that there's a rule 

458
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,900
in Washington that everything that you 
make as a couple,

459
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,570
you have to split.
We've been together for over 25 years.

460
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,470
California,
California law is.

461
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:20,430
Yes,
50 slash 50.

462
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,670
Well,
longterm marriages,

463
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,583
20 years or 10 years or more,
it's 50 slash 50 and that includes 

464
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,850
downstream income from anything you did 
that you're still getting paid for.

465
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:31,830
Say Ten years ago you wrote a book or 
whatever.

466
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Mrs Bezos is getting paid and he's worth
100 plus billion dollar and 37.

467
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,560
They said,
wow,

468
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,440
so she's going to get half of that.
We're probably going to.

469
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,303
Because it's a lot of stock.
They said they're going to have to just 

470
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:50,511
be stay friends because they better be 
super nice to him.

471
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,190
Even if he gives her a quarter.
She's like,

472
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:57,940
I got Rollin got wrong.
The richest people in the world now,

473
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,070
but after all these bookstores,
when a business,

474
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:00,904
there's some irony that Amazon now wants
to start opening physical brick and 

475
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,264
mortar stores.

476
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,343
That is kind of ironic,
but it does make sense though because 

477
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:11,030
there are some brick and mortar stores 
and I think that guy's a conquer.

478
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:12,730
I think he just wants to take over 
everything.

479
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,740
Well,
why else would he buy whole foods?

480
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,230
And I was like,
Oh,

481
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
the supermarket business,
I can fuck this up too.

482
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,403
Well,
automate it.

483
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,870
He can,
I don't know,

484
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,920
maybe get ordered whole foods delivered 
to your house.

485
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:25,630
I think the,
I don't know if that's available yet,

486
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:26,464
but I think it is right as an essay now.
Most grocery stores even like all the 

487
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,580
Ralphs have home delivery within two 
hours to compete with Amazon prime.

488
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,640
Right?
Yeah.

489
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,750
Wow.
Are.

490
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,860
And if they don't do that,
you can just order it online and pick it

491
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:39,694
up and I'll bring it out to.
I went to pavilion's the other day and 

492
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:44,580
they had a bunch of delivery trucks 
parked in the parking lot.

493
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,820
I was like,
look at this,

494
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,980
think of these cool delivery trucks.
Have to have that one store you can walk

495
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:51,814
in and there's no cashiers.
They just trust that everyone's not 

496
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:55,294
stealing.
And I think they just are comfortable 

497
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:01,150
with a certain amount of theft.
Oh Wow.

498
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,950
Yeah,
that's interesting.

499
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,933
Well,
they probably have cameras everywhere 

500
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:05,194
too,
you know,

501
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,393
but it's um,
the online purchasing like that has got 

502
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:12,220
to put,
that must be putting the most,

503
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,640
as far as like the most impact on 
stores,

504
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,474
brick and mortar stores.
It's like the ability to purchase 

505
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,000
online.
It's got to be devastating for them.

506
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:19,661
Right?
Totally.

507
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:20,494
And up in Santa Barbara where I live now
and just riding upstate street this 

508
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,550
morning at the end of the ride,
you know,

509
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,200
it's like the third,
maybe a quarter of the stores are closed

510
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,280
out of business empty and you know,
state street,

511
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,114
Santa Barbara,
this was like the happened in place to 

512
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,200
be and I and a real estate friend of 
mine says,

513
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:36,250
Oh,
well let's see that story there.

514
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,580
That's $22,000 a month to lease.
Like,

515
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,361
Whoa,
okay.

516
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:41,194
So you have to.
Then you have to have a retail outlet 

517
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:43,474
that's really turning over the customers
and there's a lot that just can't do 

518
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:46,354
that.
I mean you can't have an antique store 

519
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,210
that's going to do that are a little 
knickknack store.

520
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,493
Santa Barbara is one of my favorite 
places and it's really interesting 

521
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:56,080
because it's a,
it's a small area,

522
00:22:56,081 --> 00:23:00,210
like I don't even think there's 150,000 
people less than it is about 90,000.

523
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,250
Is it Montecito included or with 
Montecito included?

524
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:07,600
Galito Gilead is like another 30,000 or 
so below that.

525
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:10,570
You have carpenter Ria,
that's like another $20,000 or so,

526
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:13,170
so yeah,
it's beautiful.

527
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,033
Yeah,
that's great.

528
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,910
You get the right spot,
man,

529
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,650
but it's also,
I feel like it needs to be that close to

530
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:21,800
Los Angeles.
Yeah,

531
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,713
like you get a little bit of trickle.
I can sit down there 75 miles from my 

532
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:29,140
house to your studio here in my office,
in Alta Dena for a skeptic magazine.

533
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,020
That's 105 miles.
So it's doable.

534
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,610
Yeah.
Yeah,

535
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:34,450
but it's,
it's.

536
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,433
I think that as human beings when 
they're living in these gigantic 

537
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,384
communities,
whether it's Los Angeles or New York or 

538
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:42,844
something like that,
there's just a certain amount of people 

539
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:49,840
become less valuable.
You know,

540
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,683
there's just too many of them and you,
you'll lose that sort of appreciation 

541
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:57,240
for people and there's like a tension 
around like you,

542
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,800
you don't mind if a few people drop off.
It's no.

543
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,041
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

544
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,620
There's a balance in size.
My wife's from Cologne,

545
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,454
Germany,
which is about a 1 million people and 

546
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:07,660
that's,
that's about as big as you want to get.

547
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,650
It's a big enough city.
There's lots of action,

548
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:11,720
could do all sorts of things,
uh,

549
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:15,350
but it's not 6 million or 10 million,
which is just like La.

550
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,184
It's just too many of you ever seen that
study that they did where they set up a 

551
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:19,244
camera on one end of the street and the 
camera on the other end of the street 

552
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,610
and they timed people walking through 
and in those,

553
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,750
in the,
the,

554
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,583
the,
the footage of those people walking 

555
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:30,014
through,
they were able to determine by how fast 

556
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,350
these people walked.

557
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,540
They got an average of which was really 
accurate of how many people lived in the

558
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,374
city.
Yeah,

559
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,253
yeah,
yeah,

560
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,113
yeah.
The scale.

561
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,173
Yeah.
There's that book that physicist a West 

562
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,410
Jeff G,
e o f f West I think is his name,

563
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,510
wrote that book and it.
And the bigger the city,

564
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:54,500
the more efficient and faster things 
become including dialogue,

565
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,830
the way people communicate,
talk a little faster and faster.

566
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,310
And he had a formula showing how many 
restaurants per one,

567
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:05,780
hundred thousand gas stations per 
hundred thousand you'll get as you scale

568
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:06,614
up.
You don't need as many restaurants and 

569
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,343
gas stations as populations increase 
because there's more efficiency in the 

570
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,040
flow of traffic and people throughout 
the city,

571
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,550
whereas smaller towns are less efficient
that that was the theory,

572
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,863
but it's just fascinating that human 
beings adjust because of all of these 

573
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:27,890
other human beings around them.
They changed the way they walk,

574
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,080
they walk faster,
they talk faster.

575
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,063
So it's a right here scale scale the 
universal laws of life and death in the 

576
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:35,254
organism.
Cities and companies listening to it 

577
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:40,190
right now actually coincidentally,
could winky dinky.

578
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,313
Yeah.
Um,

579
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,730
that's,
that's.

580
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,890
I mean,
you feel it.

581
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,753
You know,
when I lived in boulder for a shorter 

582
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,400
amount of time,
one of the things,

583
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,540
you know,
Boulder's small as well,

584
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:53,390
I think it's 100,000 people.
When I came back here,

585
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,880
the first thing I realized is how fast 
everyone's driving,

586
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,413
right?
Everyone's just cutting everybody off 

587
00:25:58,401 --> 00:25:59,830
and zooming ahead and,
and,

588
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:02,420
and people are really in a rush 
everywhere they go.

589
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,430
And that has to be in some way,
shape or form.

590
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:11,240
It has to be influenced by all the other
people around them and their energy.

591
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,690
Right.
What is that?

592
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,810
What do you think that is though?
Well,

593
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,190
first of all,
it's all unconscious.

594
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,024
I think it's just mostly the kind of 
overall pace you get that pushes 

595
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:22,520
everybody along.
We're slows them down.

596
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,570
I just started this book called a rule 
makers and rule breakers.

597
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,350
It's a by a woman who is a cultural 
psychologist.

598
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,740
Sorry,
I forget her name,

599
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,153
the rule makers rule breakers.
So he talks about tight cultures versus 

600
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,150
losing as fast as a fucking Michele 
gelfand yet.

601
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,130
So she talks about tight versus loose

602
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,840
culture.
So like again,

603
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:46,674
my wife from Germany,
it's a tighter culture that the norm 

604
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,543
that people are more likely to obey 
norms and rules and there's a little 

605
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:54,630
more uncomfortableness and violating 
them.

606
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,900
California were a little loosey Goosey 
about rules and,

607
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,750
and so my wife's,
I was giving me a hard time about,

608
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:01,803
you know,
my idea of traffic laws is I'll just do 

609
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,104
whatever,
you know,

610
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,710
I feel like pretty much if,
as long as it's safe and I kind of know,

611
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,581
uh,
you know,

612
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:12,330
I'm driving up the one on one.
If I stay at a 79 or below,

613
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,410
I'm fine.
And she's like,

614
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:14,950
but the 65,
it's like,

615
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,163
yeah,
so what?

616
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,720
I mean,
I know where the cops park.

617
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,150
I know everybody else is going on in the
left,

618
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:24,900
turn into our street is a left Arrow.
So of course my wife,

619
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,220
she's just like,
well we got to wait.

620
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,360
It's like,
but it's midnight.

621
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,250
I'm just going to go.
You can't go.

622
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,761
It's like,
yeah,

623
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:30,810
this California,
I'm going

624
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,353
nowhere.
So that's a tight culture versus loose 

625
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,570
culture.
So I guess she's going to talk about how

626
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,290
norms that affect laws and how then 
people change their behavior.

627
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,640
You're not even aware that you're doing 
this,

628
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:47,310
you're just kind of unconsciously 
absorbing the cultures.

629
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,743
But what do you think?
But there's a difference between west 

630
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:53,394
coast tight culture like la or large 
groups rather an east coast large 

631
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:58,464
groups.
Do you think that's influenced by 

632
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:01,530
whether it's one of the things that I've
been thinking about a lot,

633
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,753
the,
the aggression of east coasters is very 

634
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:08,020
different than the aggression of West 
coasters and I always wonder,

635
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:08,854
it's like how much of that is because 
they have to deal with shit whether for 

636
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,260
five months out of the year it could be 
that,

637
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:13,990
I don't know.

638
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,520
I'm a and the influence of immigrants as
well,

639
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,960
like because,
uh,

640
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,310
like my,
my parents,

641
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,173
my grandparents were immigrants.
They all came over from England and 

642
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:26,490
Ireland and Italy and they were all 
savages.

643
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,670
They were all people that were willing 
to get on a boat and cross the ocean.

644
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:30,361
Right.
You know,

645
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,800
those are aggressive people.
They're like,

646
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,150
I'm getting Outta here.
Fuck you.

647
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,480
And then the landlord Alzheimer's,
you're higher risk takers.

648
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,320
Yes,
yes.

649
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,340
Yeah,
yeah.

650
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,683
Yeah.
So it's not a random population that 

651
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:42,330
came to America,
nor with Australia,

652
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,860
you know,
you send all these converts on fixed.

653
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,750
They're not going to be a typical gene 
pool there.

654
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,480
So meanwhile,
how good did that work out?

655
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,420
Those are the nicest people ever.
Well,

656
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,460
same thing,
you know,

657
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,290
Germans after World War One and World 
War Two,

658
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,550
oh,
these are bellicose people,

659
00:28:56,551 --> 00:29:00,030
but there are national character now.
They're the nicest people in the world.

660
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,400
They don't want to fight anybody.
Yeah.

661
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,410
That generation,
right?

662
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,763
More than that.
I mean they have massive war guilt and 

663
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,770
guilt.
Uh,

664
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,683
yeah.
I mean they are all raised in taking 

665
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,310
tons of classes in school about what 
happened,

666
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,290
why we're never going to do this again.
Here's what we did at the Jew,

667
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,124
you know,
they're still paying Israel reparations 

668
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,354
for that.
There are these little stumbling stones 

669
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,923
that are the sort of brass square cubes 
all over Germany of the name and year 

670
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:35,760
that that person was murdered.
These are all Jews in front of the house

671
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:38,100
where they used to live there all over 
the place.

672
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:38,934
Yeah.
I have a picture of him and the moral 

673
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:40,801
arc here,
I'll show you.

674
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:42,190
It's,
it's really dramatic.

675
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,083
It's.
And when you literally stumbled across 

676
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:45,911
them,
I mean,

677
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,310
they're just there in the street.
Uh,

678
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,620
you might,
if you google stumbling stones,

679
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,510
you can see that they're better in four 
color.

680
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,613
Another interesting thing about Germany 
is they won't let scientology and 

681
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,740
sensitive about cults and cult behavior.
That's right.

682
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,870
Well,
there's another reason for that and that

683
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:05,620
is in the picture.
Now I'm in Germany.

684
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:08,010
Most people don't know this.
There's a religious studios.

685
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Jamie's religion.
Yeah.

686
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:09,701
There they go.
Oh,

687
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:12,030
so that's what they.
So they're actually above ground.

688
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,160
So you're just walking along and you 
look down and some of them,

689
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:16,780
those are not the.
They're not like that,

690
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:17,614
right?
They're not like little bricks on the 

691
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:19,354
ground and they're like that.
You just said there in the ground and 

692
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,930
the ground persons and they're in front 
of the house where they used to live the

693
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:26,764
date that they were departed in the date
that they were murdered and where they 

694
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:32,740
were murdered.
Auschwitz or a tribe triplink or dominic

695
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:33,970
and so on.
Yeah,

696
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,770
there you go.
So that's pretty moving.

697
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,870
It's and it's,
it's kind of a reminder,

698
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,710
this is what we did and we were not 
going to do this again.

699
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,100
Remember?
So that's changing norms.

700
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:46,120
How does this happen?
Really?

701
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:49,270
It's that you can do it through the law 
from the top down,

702
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:51,280
but really it's more a culture from the 
bottom up.

703
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,670
You were saying that there's another 
reason besides that,

704
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,150
besides the Holocaust,
that they're sensitive to scientology.

705
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,320
Oh yeah.
Because in Germany they have a religious

706
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:05,950
withholding tax.
So when you get your first job,

707
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:06,963
they do a withholding for your religion 
and they give a percentage of your 

708
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:10,474
paycheck to your religion,
the religion you were born into 

709
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:13,660
baptized,
whatever.

710
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,613
It's mostly Catholic and Protestant,
but others want to get in on that 

711
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:19,970
because that's cumulative.
You know,

712
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:21,940
you can make some money doing this as a 
religion.

713
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,120
The humanists of Germany get a little 
piece of this action.

714
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,970
It's considered a religion.
So scientology when they saw that,

715
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:28,540
they went,
oh,

716
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,890
okay,
free government money,

717
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
tax money,
and uh,

718
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,320
the Germans got,
no,

719
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,410
you're not a real religion.
You're not getting in on this.

720
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:36,850
And uh,
yeah.

721
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,640
So again,
when,

722
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:42,340
when my wife came here,
before she came here,

723
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:45,610
she quit church and you literally have 
to go down to the courthouse,

724
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,030
fill out a form and say,
I am leaving the church.

725
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,790
Please don't take my money anymore out 
of my paycheck.

726
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:52,624
So you have to opt out.
You will be giving money to your 

727
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:56,020
religion unless you fill out the form 
and opt out.

728
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,070
Wow.
And uh,

729
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,923
and,
and in this case it was kind of a funny 

730
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:01,241
story.
They go,

731
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:03,220
okay,
so just to make sure you know,

732
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,054
now if you sign this,
you can't get married in the Catholic 

733
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,570
church,
can't get buried in the Catholic church.

734
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,000
You can't go to the ceremonies and so 
on,

735
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,470
you're done.
And she goes,

736
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,670
Yep,
that's the way I want it.

737
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:14,580
And she went down there with her four 
horsemen,

738
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:16,240
tee-shirts,
said Dawkins,

739
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,560
Dennis Harrison,
hitchins.

740
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,800
And they're like,
who's this?

741
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,460
Anyway?
So they set up,

742
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:24,730
but now the moment you signed it starts 
effective today.

743
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,440
But there's a three month lag for us to 
not take the money out of your paycheck.

744
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,150
My wife is like,
yeah,

745
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,140
like,
wait a minute.

746
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:32,974
It went up in a business.
When it contract ends at ANZ for both 

747
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:36,034
parties.
They go like,

748
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,053
no,
they just get to steal money for three 

749
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:38,801
months,
three more months.

750
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,190
Yeah.
What a weird thing

751
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,450
that you have to opt out like that,
that it has to be so definitive that you

752
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:49,451
have to sign papers and go someplace.
What does fucking shady law it is?

753
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,740
It's no good.
I know that's gotta change.

754
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:56,540
So a lot of us are trying to talk people
into opting out quit church.

755
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,403
Well,
it is amazing that in this country I 

756
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,183
would like to know what the number is if
the churches in this country had to pay 

757
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:05,534
taxes didn't mean clearly,
especially when you look at the 

758
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,163
televangelist that are driving rolls 
royces and flying around in private 

759
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:12,194
jets.
I mean there's profit is extreme amount 

760
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:14,984
of profit and it's discretionary income.
They can do whatever they want with it 

761
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,460
and you're,
you're dealing with massive,

762
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:22,010
massive sums of money and they don't 
contribute.

763
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:22,963
So these people are clearly personally 
benefiting from the contributions of 

764
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:26,810
these people.

765
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,643
And then they don't pay taxes on it.
And in the case of like ministers who 

766
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:33,380
live in a church owned home,
they don't have to pay property tax.

767
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,160
Uh,
there's a lot of hidden benefits there.

768
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,140
It's dirty,
it is dirty.

769
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,090
It's amazing that it's still here.
I mean,

770
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:43,730
especially when you deal with something 
like scientology will,

771
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:47,040
you know,
the guy who wrote it like it's,

772
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,080
this is not some ancient texts that were
handed down from,

773
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,843
you know,
the guy and the guy was a terrible 

774
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:55,640
writer.
I mean,

775
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:57,830
he was a terrible science fiction 
author.

776
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:01,580
He just wrote every fucking thing he 
wrote was a first draft,

777
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,950
just boom gone.
I mean,

778
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:04,784
it's just the most nonsensical nonsense 
writing and yet they don't have to pay 

779
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:10,820
taxes because it's considered a 
legitimate religion.

780
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,003
Hurl is Harlan Ellison,
the great science fiction writer this 

781
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,870
year,
uh,

782
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,703
told me the story of what the famous 
story where l Ron Hubbard allegedly 

783
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:19,760
said,
I'm going to go start a religion.

784
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,590
He said it was,
it's real.

785
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,890
It's a true story.
They were but,

786
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,630
but it was just a bunch of science 
fiction writers sitting around like this

787
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,210
chatting and complaining about how 
poorly paid they are.

788
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:30,800
They have to crank out by the word,
you know,

789
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,680
Kenny at word kind of thing.
And somebody said,

790
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,840
you know,
we should just start a religion and make

791
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,070
shit up like that.
And I'll,

792
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:37,971
Ron Hubbard says,
yeah,

793
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:39,050
you know,
that's a good idea,

794
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:40,310
I think.
I think I might do that.

795
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,570
And then he went out and wrote dianetics
and that became the founding document of

796
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,490
scientology.
Did you watch the,

797
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,770
um,
the HBO series on it?

798
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,520
The documentary rather?
Yeah,

799
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,370
going clear.
Unbelievable.

800
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:53,900
That's the best documentary on.
Of course,

801
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:58,901
I've seen AALIYAH's show.
She's got a big guts to go after.

802
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,783
I don't know if she's got good lawyers 
are a and he has good lawyers or 

803
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:03,860
whatever.

804
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,820
Maybe they've stopped suing people.
I don't know.

805
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,350
I think the climate has shifted and I 
think people were more,

806
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,000
first of all,
for the longest time,

807
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,430
all we thought of when you thought about
scientology,

808
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:16,350
thought about positive thinking and John
Travolta,

809
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,490
Tom Cruise and they're all super 
positive,

810
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,593
you know,
and they're getting things done and 

811
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,244
there's auditing and they're really 
taking care of their mind and thinking 

812
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,000
clearly and eliminating all the negative
influences.

813
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,420
But then once there was a bunch of 
factors I think.

814
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:36,830
But once the Internet opened up these 
the doctrines and you've got a chance to

815
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:37,664
read it and people got a chance to mock 
it and then South Park did that whole 

816
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,590
series on it where they,
this is what they actually believe.

817
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:46,140
And you see like when south park did 
that,

818
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:47,370
everybody was like,
Holy Shit,

819
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:48,270
wait a minute,
is that real?

820
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,630
And then people started googling it and 
then looking into it and then it started

821
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:52,320
to unravel.

822
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,020
Slowly but surely people started leaving
the church,

823
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:55,854
Lawrence Wright wrote the book,
all these things are happening and now 

824
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,190
Leah is coming in and Leah was,
you know,

825
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,170
I knew her but I mean I'm friends with 
Kevin James from the king and Queen.

826
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,004
And so I,
I've known Leah for 20 plus years and 

827
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,340
when I first met her she was just like 
this hard ass beautiful woman who's just

828
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,920
like driven and like,
like she's a scientologist,

829
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,490
like Oh,
let's get the fuck out of her way.

830
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,620
You know?
It was like that.

831
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,453
She's just like super active and just 
getting things done and just being 

832
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:25,830
productive.
I mean,

833
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:28,020
that's what you thought about when you 
thought about scientology,

834
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,960
but now what you think about it is 
nonsense.

835
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,800
It's just foolishness and,
and once going clear area and you've got

836
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:39,801
to see l Ron Hubbard and listened to him
talk and you see the captain's outfit he

837
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:43,500
had on with the medals that he gave 
himself.

838
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,270
Like what?
Who would buy this test?

839
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,600
Cell Dumb.
It's just,

840
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,630
it's amazing that it's so effective and 
so financially successful.

841
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,351
Uh,
yeah.

842
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,270
I think their membership roles are 
pretty low,

843
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:00,390
but their property holdings I think are 
pretty extensive.

844
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,283
Yeah.
I mean they're the second biggest real 

845
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,010
estate owner in Los Angeles.
Is that right?

846
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,600
Yeah.
At least they were.

847
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,633
There were some Japanese folks that were
number one and then it was a number two 

848
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:14,490
was scientology.
Maybe that's not true anymore.

849
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,570
Might be oil barons now.
Well,

850
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,820
back in the nineties when the Internet 
first got cranked up,

851
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,263
we were doing articles on scientology is
when some of these ex members started 

852
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:26,724
posting the secret doctrines,
the news story and the going clear at 

853
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,920
level eight or whatever.
When you find out the the,

854
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,080
the,
the inside story,

855
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,483
and they got raided.
I mean the scientologists went to court 

856
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,483
to court to judges and said,
this is copyrighted material and it's 

857
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:43,650
like,
what,

858
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,470
wait your religion,
how can you copyright of religious?

859
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,750
Well,
and they somehow got around that.

860
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:49,584
I mean,
this would be like the Catholic church 

861
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:50,994
not telling you about Jesus and the 
resurrection until level eight after 

862
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:55,860
you've paid $100,000 or something like 
that.

863
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:56,920
It's just insane.
Well,

864
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,620
what's amazing is that the irs caved in.
When that happened,

865
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:02,580
I remember when that happened,
I thought,

866
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,710
oh my God,
I don't want to fuck with these guys.

867
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:06,420
I mean they'd beat the irs.
I'm a nobody.

868
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,900
How am I going to defend myself again?
But maybe they've stopped suing people.

869
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:10,734
Maybe they're not going after Leah.
Like la real estate here goes portfolio 

870
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:18,270
properties reported at $400,
million dollars in Hollywood alone,

871
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:19,560
paid for in cash.
No less.

872
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:20,394
The Church of Scientology is undeniably 
a formidable player in the real estate 

873
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:26,340
game.
That's what you got.

874
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,920
They have some beautiful properties to.
Yeah.

875
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,070
It's just really amazing.
It's amazing.

876
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,173
So you know,
my,

877
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,370
my skyping friends like,
oh,

878
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,340
they're going to go out of anytime soon.

879
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,061
It's like,
I don't know.

880
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,340
I think they could have practically no 
members instilled.

881
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,710
They have all this real estate.
Here's the thing,

882
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,160
even though it's nonsense,
just

883
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,960
so is most religion,
let's just be honest.

884
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,794
I mean if you want to talk about guys 
coming back from the dead after being 

885
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,464
burned for three days or Adam and eve 
being the only two people and they have 

886
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:57,394
kids and their kids just started having 
sex with each other and that makes all 

887
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:03,910
the people in the world or Moses parting
the Red Sea and Jesus walking on water.

888
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,830
I mean,
you're looking at horse shit everywhere.

889
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,070
It's just older horseshit.
It's,

890
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,923
you know,
whether or not it's based on some real 

891
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,250
events or some real people.
Who knows?

892
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,250
Who knows?
But it's all nonsense.

893
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,790
Have you ever heard a giulia,
Sweeney's monologue letting go of God?

894
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,683
No.
Do you know Julia from Saturday night 

895
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:20,830
live?

896
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,450
I know who she is.
I do not know her.

897
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,820
She just moved back to La.
So you should have her on the show.

898
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:25,840
She's terrific.
Love to,

899
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,033
so um,
she was born and raised Catholic love 

900
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,320
being a Catholic,
the whole culture and you all.

901
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,030
That was great.
And then she started reading Dawkins and

902
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:34,864
me and Harris and so on and then kind of
let all that go and then she wrote a 

903
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,100
monologue.
It's very moving.

904
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:39,934
So the model like opens,
she's in her house in Hollywood and the 

905
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:44,494
Mormon boys come by and she invites them
in and they want to tell the story and 

906
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,650
she's thinking this is like a Hollywood 
pitch story.

907
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:52,690
You're going to pitch the story and I'll
get back to you later.

908
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,670
Tell you to like it.
No,

909
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:55,504
no.
They wanted it to actually press to see 

910
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,900
if she could join right then and there,
you know,

911
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,110
they're on their two year mission that 
they do,

912
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:01,944
you know,
a picture of these 2:18 year olds with 

913
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:05,200
their white starch shirts and their 
bicycles.

914
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,960
And so Julia starts pressing him a 
little bit.

915
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:11,170
So what's the story here?
Well see this guy,

916
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,390
Joseph Smith,
he,

917
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,253
he found these gold plates in his 
backyard and he translated to them from 

918
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,373
ancient hieroglyphics into English.
And with these magic stones and they're 

919
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,024
going on and then Jesus came to America 
and there was the good Indians and the 

920
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,340
Indians.
And Julie's like,

921
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,620
I just want to tell them,
okay,

922
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,120
don't start with this story.
This is a bad pitch story.

923
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,260
Even the scientologists no,
don't tell them about new until way down

924
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,870
the line.
But then she says,

925
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:38,950
reflecting on it,
you know,

926
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:41,560
if,
if I told somebody my Catholic story who

927
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,394
never heard of it,
it would sound just as wacky because 

928
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,490
it's virgin and the resurrection will 
let all of its wacky.

929
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,720
One hundred percent.
I mean,

930
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,610
it's like we were talking about earlier.
When you die,

931
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,950
what's going to happen is you don't 
know.

932
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,200
You don't know.
And the reality is,

933
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,630
look,
maybe there is an afterlife.

934
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,493
Maybe when we stopped living,
something happens and our essential 

935
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:08,440
energy goes into another dimension.
It's possible,

936
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,750
but you don't know.
Look,

937
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,000
being alive is so titanic,
Lee Bizarre.

938
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,233
Just being a human being,
looking through eyeballs at each other 

939
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:17,434
across from this wooden table that was 
cut down from living organisms that 

940
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:25,810
turned into hearts or surfaces,
sand them and saw him.

941
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:26,644
And then he put it in a building and 
it's got electricity's rolling through 

942
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:31,180
the walls and if you stuck a fork in 
there,

943
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,980
you die.
All of it is the fact that we're on a

944
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,770
planet.
I mean the fact that the universe is,

945
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:39,650
at least as far as we can tell,
infinite,

946
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,723
all that stuff is crazy.
The idea that your essential energy 

947
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:47,330
doesn't transfer into some other state.
Why not?

948
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,540
The whole thing is crazy,
but you don't know.

949
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,230
That's right.
No,

950
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,730
no.
You don't know to you.

951
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:57,230
Whenever you say something that you're 
not sure of and you say,

952
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,660
this is what's going to happen,
but you don't really know.

953
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,070
You're a huckster.
That's right.

954
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,030
Yep.
Absolutely.

955
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,230
No one knows.
No one knows.

956
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,820
And that's the conclusion.
Heavens on earth.

957
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:06,080
I don't know.
And you don't either.

958
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,960
I saw a bumper sticker that said 
militant agnostic.

959
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,130
I don't know.
And you don't either.

960
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,010
Uh,
so I mean we have to.

961
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:14,860
Okay.
So here's my bottom line on this yet.

962
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:15,621
I don't know.
You don't.

963
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:16,454
No one knows for sure.
I'm happy to wake up and some great 

964
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,700
place and there's a lot of my friends 
will be awesome unless.

965
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,813
Unless it.
God was mad that you didn't follow the 

966
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:25,240
rules and all that.
That's right.

967
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,820
Christopher hitchens called the 
Christian Heaven Celestial North Korea.

968
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,980
It's like,
here's this dictator.

969
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,190
Then knows everything you do and 
controls everything forever.

970
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,200
Celestial North Korea,
but he doesn't tell you any more.

971
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,093
I told you already.
I told you 2000 years ago this dude 

972
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,900
wrote it down.
Pay attention to that,

973
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,280
but then it's not even that,
right?

974
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,720
It's like one guy might've write it down
a long time ago,

975
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,960
but then a bunch of other dudes got 
together and how to revise it.

976
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,690
They had like a new draft and the new 
drug,

977
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:57,524
they get to decide.
People got to decide what goes in and 

978
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:00,644
what doesn't go in and some of the 
stories are based on accounts from 

979
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:07,370
hundreds of years after Jesus's death.
Like the Bible is a Wiki.

980
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,593
It is like a wicked.
People contributed to over the years 

981
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,010
until hitchens a at a great analogy with
a.

982
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,973
When he was dying,
he wrote a series of essays for Vanity 

983
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,910
Fair,
his column a,

984
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,973
which you can get as a book now,
I think it's called mortality or 

985
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,030
something like that.
Anyway,

986
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:23,864
I'm.
One of them was people think dying is 

987
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:29,690
like you're at a party and someone taps 
you on the shoulder and says,

988
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,830
you have to leave.
Now.

989
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,770
At worst the party is going to go on 
without you.

990
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,663
It's like,
oh no.

991
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,481
He goes,
okay,

992
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:36,314
so let's play this out.
You're at the party and you get tapped 

993
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:42,140
on the shoulder and said,
uh,

994
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,160
you can never leave the party.
You have to stay here forever with these

995
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:48,250
people.
Like when it,

996
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,180
Julie is funny,
lines is Mormon.

997
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:51,590
Boys were telling her like,
in heaven,

998
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:53,560
it's going to be great.
Um,

999
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,010
you,
you,

1000
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:55,903
you're made whole again,
like the blind shall see and the deaf 

1001
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:59,740
shall hear again in the crippled,
she'll be holding in.

1002
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,863
And she said,
well,

1003
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,950
um,
I had uterine cancer and I had my uterus

1004
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,630
taken out.
Do I get my uterus back?

1005
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,210
And they're like,
you can imagine these 18 year old,

1006
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,350
like,
what's the uterus again?

1007
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,211
And they're like,
yeah,

1008
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:12,350
you get your uterus back.
She goes,

1009
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:14,060
I don't want it back.
And then she said,

1010
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:16,130
what if he had a nose job and you liked 
it?

1011
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,250
Do I have to have my old nose back in 
heaven?

1012
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,280
That's a good point.
Yeah.

1013
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,310
So,
uh,

1014
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,153
and then they said that,
and you get to spend the rest of 

1015
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,740
eternity with your family.
And she went,

1016
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:26,990
oh no,
that would not be good in my case.

1017
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,973
Maybe there'll be cured though.
They'll realize the errors of their 

1018
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,160
ways.
There'll be all enlightened.

1019
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,060
Well,
here's the product.

1020
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:34,560
So this is called the problem of 
identity.

1021
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:35,990
Who are you?
And you know,

1022
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,970
the,
the theseus is shipped,

1023
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,830
you know,
the Greek men Atar slayer,

1024
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,350
theseus comes back and is a hero and 
they,

1025
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,140
and they preserve his ship and the 
museum forever,

1026
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,660
but the wood rots and they replaced the 
ship.

1027
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,270
And over the centuries there's no wood 
left from the original,

1028
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,104
but it's still cherished as if I call 
this termers Mustang because my first 

1029
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:58,770
car was a 66 Ford Mustang classic.
And I had that for 19 years.

1030
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,670
Those cars,
it's like it was a great car,

1031
00:45:00,671 --> 00:45:03,090
but I banged it up so much I replaced 
this and that,

1032
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,080
you know,
every pretty much.

1033
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,943
By the time I sold it as a classic and 
made a nice little chunk of change on 

1034
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:08,724
it,
there was very little of the original 

1035
00:45:09,571 --> 00:45:11,790
left.
But it's the pattern,

1036
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:12,624
not the material that counts.
So this whole debate about when you're 

1037
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:19,230
resurrected in heaven with Jesus,
what's up there?

1038
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,170
Is that your physical body?
If,

1039
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,830
because some Christian sects say,
yeah,

1040
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,551
it's like,
okay,

1041
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:26,160
how old are you when you're in heaven 
30.

1042
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,083
This is the year they came up with 
because that's the year age Jesus was 

1043
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,500
when he was crucified.
Okay.

1044
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:33,930
But if Joe Rogan,
I don't held 40 something.

1045
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,400
Fifty 1:51.
Okay.

1046
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:36,234
So if,
if you're a resurrected at 30 year old 

1047
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:38,874
Joe Rogan,
what happened to the last 21 years of 

1048
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:43,470
Joe Rogan's body memories?
I don't want to go back to that dude.

1049
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,920
That dude was down.
You don't know.

1050
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,560
You're happy where you are in your life 
at this for sure.

1051
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,370
Yeah,
yeah,

1052
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,390
yeah.
Well,

1053
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:52,224
that means you're a well lived life,
so what's up there with Jesus a or 

1054
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,680
wouldn't mind having that body 30 year 
old body problems?

1055
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,403
I've been beating on it

1056
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,273
21 years since then,
like when I was 13 when I got hardcore 

1057
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:10,480
into Jitsu,
so that's 20 years of getting choked.

1058
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,480
Of course the Christian would say,
well God makes you whole again,

1059
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,960
you'll have no injuries but that's not 
really part of you.

1060
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,250
Part of you is your injuries,
your muscles know

1061
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,610
to say those,
but all those,

1062
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,520
all the stuff that I did that hurt me.
I also learned from that's right.

1063
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,770
Make you stronger but not just that,
like learned the story.

1064
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,283
I think through incremental struggle 
with whether it's rigorous exercise or 

1065
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:36,963
learning something or a.
I think everything that I do that's 

1066
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:42,880
difficult makes me just a little bit 
more aware,

1067
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:45,610
a little bit better at other things.
Just a little bit,

1068
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,060
a little bit better to talk to a little 
bit easier to deal with,

1069
00:46:49,061 --> 00:46:51,910
a little more friendly and all those 
things.

1070
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:52,744
I think I wouldn't give up for anything.
I think that's more important than 

1071
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,570
whatever injuries I've got with.
I think,

1072
00:46:59,460 --> 00:46:59,901
you know,
I,

1073
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,750
I wonder how you're going to feel when 
you're 80.

1074
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:04,780
I wonder if you feel like that there's 
got to be a point of diminishing returns

1075
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:05,614
like that.
I'd rather be stupid and 40 than to be 

1076
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,630
enlightened and can't get out of bed 
very well.

1077
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,350
My older athletic friend is telling me 
it's about mid eighties when things drop

1078
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:19,460
off fairly quickly and they could stay 
pretty fit into their seventies,

1079
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,530
maybe still racing,
bike racing at 80,

1080
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,680
but 85 or so things drop off pretty 
quick.

1081
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,740
That's where you've got to go to hormone
replacement or whatever.

1082
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:29,650
Yeah.
Or the ice pledges or the.

1083
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,310
Yeah,
the,

1084
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,770
the,
the young person's blood or something.

1085
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,970
Okay.
So I deal with it,

1086
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:36,040
you know,
there's no breakthrough miracles yet,

1087
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,563
but again,
I'm not against any of these things 

1088
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:39,221
happening.
You know,

1089
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:40,054
when,
when someone like Jeff Bezos puts 

1090
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,040
$100,000,000 into an aging company,
I hope he's successful.

1091
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,050
Does he have $100,000,000 in an aging 
company?

1092
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:47,943
Uh,
he and Peter thiel and the Google guys 

1093
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:51,754
through Calico and a few others have 
invested many hundreds of millions of 

1094
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,560
dollars into cup like Calico for 
example.

1095
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:57,963
These are companies that are trying to.
Their big goal is to defeat aging 

1096
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:06,100
through reengineering cells and um,
that,

1097
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,213
that's the sort of philosophical goal 
behind it is we have to defeat aging so 

1098
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:13,270
people can live for centuries or forever
to which I say,

1099
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,090
let's not worry about living 500 years,
let's,

1100
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,053
let's worry about prostate cancer and 
breast cancer and Alzheimer's and 

1101
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,110
dementia.

1102
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,470
And so I just,
the little incremental medical problem,

1103
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,050
quality of life things were the things 
that take people out young.

1104
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,300
Yeah.
So that you can live a longer,

1105
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,260
higher quality life.
But Imagine Michael Shermer at 300 years

1106
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:35,890
old,
if not,

1107
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,723
keep this body.
If you can keep the body that you have 

1108
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:38,860
now,
you're moving around,

1109
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:39,641
great.
Everything's well.

1110
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:42,130
You look really healthy.
How smart would you be?

1111
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,400
How much?
How much more enlightened or wise?

1112
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:48,340
Maybe
I'm not against that.

1113
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:50,410
I'm happy to live as long as I possibly 
can.

1114
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:51,790
There are,
there are people that go,

1115
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,410
well that's not right.
It's not natural.

1116
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:54,010
It's like,
okay,

1117
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:54,843
what's natural?
There's surveys on this people and 

1118
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:59,620
people's answer is whatever the current 
average lifespan is.

1119
00:48:59,621 --> 00:48:59,981
So.
Well,

1120
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:01,720
80 seems about right.
Okay.

1121
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:03,260
Fast forward to your,
uh,

1122
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,860
the day before your 80th birthday.
Tomorrow you're going to go.

1123
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,360
You want another week?

1124
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,370
Yeah,
I'll take another week.

1125
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,560
Okay.
Then fast forward six days a,

1126
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,360
would you like another month?
I'll take another month.

1127
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:14,260
Thank you.
And,

1128
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,920
and that would never end.
So of course if you're healthy and happy

1129
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,490
and you don't want it off yourself or 
whatever because you're super,

1130
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,510
super depressed or something like that.
Yes.

1131
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:24,370
You're just gonna want to keep going?
Nothing wrong with that.

1132
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,940
If we can do that,
but what if you die and it's way better.

1133
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,700
What if you die and you really do,
you leave your physical body.

1134
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:38,650
There's no need for emotions and all the
entanglements of human existence and you

1135
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:39,484
go to this beautiful place of bliss and 
life and love and it's just pure love 

1136
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,220
without a body.
Yeah.

1137
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,420
And embodied an unhindered.
I don't know what.

1138
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:50,860
That'd be fun.
I don't know what's.

1139
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,620
Is that what we're here for?
We're here for fun.

1140
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,510
We're doing a shitty job.
The chatty going crazy right now.

1141
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,840
Should be in a party van on the way to 
Vegas.

1142
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,013
I had a college professor when I was in 
my Christian days who asked me when I 

1143
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:06,010
was pitching him the Christian story.
He says,

1144
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,013
are there golf courses and tennis courts
in heaven because I like physical 

1145
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:10,924
challenges.
You want to get out there and push 

1146
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:14,740
myself like I don't know.
You know,

1147
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,080
so I mean we'd haven't been no 
challenges,

1148
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,120
no working out,
no physical,

1149
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,980
you know,
tensions and true,

1150
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:22,060
right?
Yeah.

1151
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,933
And maybe you don't need it,
so you'd have to remove that part of 

1152
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:28,100
humanity that we'd no longer

1153
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,800
want challenges and to be pushed to 
better ourselves.

1154
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,750
Do they play chess in heaven
when

1155
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,630
you get to win in heaven or is everybody
a winner?

1156
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,620
Everybody gets a gold medal and a Nobel 
prize and whatever.

1157
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,130
That's.
That is a problem.

1158
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,730
Are the things that we're attracted to,
things that we enjoy,

1159
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:50,750
accomplishments and achievements and all
these things that they exist only inside

1160
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:54,770
of the civilization inside of this,
this realm that we've created.

1161
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,873
The significance of them is entirely 
based on our own agreements that it's 

1162
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,600
important.
When you take the king right now,

1163
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,460
it's important when the ball goes into 
the net,

1164
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,323
these we've agreed,
you know when someone shoots a three 

1165
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,870
pointer,
it's really not that big a deal.

1166
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:11,920
You just throwing a ball into a hole.
Really significant happens,

1167
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,020
but because we've attached all of this 
meaning to that,

1168
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,920
then it's something that we really want 
to see and everybody score the goal went

1169
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,360
in the Puck,
went in the net.

1170
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:23,860
Yes.
It becomes this giant thing if they just

1171
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,630
have no good answer for this.
When he said,

1172
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:26,630
well,
what's heaven like?

1173
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,980
Psychics will tell you it's a bliss and 
lever would.

1174
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,860
But what does that mean?
It sounds again,

1175
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:32,300
back to hitch.
It sounds boring.

1176
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,960
I have to stay at this party forever.
That sounds boring.

1177
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,440
Did you ever see the guy who took a 
photo of himself in heaven?

1178
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,700
No.
You ever saw that

1179
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:46,050
he used the Samsung Galaxy phone to take
a,

1180
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,933
to take a picture of himself in heaven?
Are there what clouds are white is 

1181
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,440
smiling.
It is one of the funniest fucking photos

1182
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:55,274
you're ever going to find on the 
Internet just because of the context of 

1183
00:51:56,841 --> 00:51:57,561
it and it's fun.
Yeah.

1184
00:51:57,561 --> 00:52:00,360
I believe he was an African gentleman 
who was a.

1185
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,160
either he's telling the truth or is 
hilariously full of shit.

1186
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,233
I mean,
imagine if he really did go to heaven 

1187
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:08,150
and took a picture and we're just 
mocking them.

1188
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,490
Really.
We should be going to him for advice.

1189
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,800
That's right.
So what is it really found it.

1190
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,780
You see the picture,
the mocking,

1191
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,570
the memes of making fun of them 
afterwards.

1192
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,810
The actual picture.
I'm trying to find the original.

1193
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,640
Just Google man takes.
I did.

1194
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,510
That's what everyone wants to make fun 
of.

1195
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,230
The edit is so overwhelmingly mocking.
It's so good.

1196
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,890
Oh,
that's got to be playing a large part.

1197
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,840
Got It.
I think this is.

1198
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,990
Everyone's saying this same this,
but no,

1199
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,880
it was all white.
It wasn't like that.

1200
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:41,953
It wasn't that.
It was just like that picture of him 

1201
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:46,574
holding his hand up like that,
but it was just the background wasn't 

1202
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,650
rainbows and shit like that.
You could find it,

1203
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:53,330
man.
I have faith in you.

1204
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:55,240
I found it the other day.
Um,

1205
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,460
it's,
you know,

1206
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:00,803
it's just hilarious that someone would 
be so confident to put that picture 

1207
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:06,464
online knowing full well that the world 
is going to see that picture and start 

1208
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:12,110
rubbing.
The Guy who sold his soul on Ebay.

1209
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,210
I forget,
I forget what he got for it,

1210
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:16,760
but a lot of religious people were 
offended by this.

1211
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,170
You can't tell your soul why not.
You sold your soul to your religion.

1212
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,620
Did he get a good price?
I don't know.

1213
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,350
I think it was a theater bucks or 
something like that,

1214
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,620
but he wanted to go to dinner with that.
Yeah,

1215
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,673
that's right.

1216
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,600
But my concern about all of this,
obsession with the afterlife,

1217
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,640
that's not it.
This is from his page.

1218
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,290
It says,
woke up this morning and saw this.

1219
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:39,000
Had to take a picture.
Oh,

1220
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,530
okay.
We'll start with devin.

1221
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,520
That's not the actual photo.
That photo of him and having his.

1222
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,260
What's hilarious is that picture with 
him that far left,

1223
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,220
far left.
That's it.

1224
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,840
That's it.
That's the photo.

1225
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,420
That is him.
That is the photo.

1226
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,600
Went to heaven and that's it.
That's the exact photo he took.

1227
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,950
I don't know who took the puddle.
He's like,

1228
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:56,784
Hey,
angel,

1229
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,780
do me a solid.
Yes,

1230
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,350
not a selfie.
So his one hand is down so he's not.

1231
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,540
He's not taking it with that hand.
The other hand is up,

1232
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,870
lets him in heaven.
Love it.

1233
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,660
The Internet is so good for mocking 
things though.

1234
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,523
It's so good.
It's one of the best things ever in 

1235
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:16,614
terms of like there's so many people 
that are paying attention and so many 

1236
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:22,950
people that are funny that aren't 
comedians per se.

1237
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,783
They just might work in an office 
somewhere and they've got a little bit 

1238
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:25,884
of free time and they'll make a 
hilarious meme about something and then 

1239
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,260
everybody runs with it and things just 
get mocked mercilessly.

1240
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,453
Remember the the video of the guy,
he was having an interview and his kids 

1241
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:35,894
started walking in behind him and he's 
trying to talk about foreign relations 

1242
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:41,520
in Poland or something and the little 
kid is back here and then somebody.

1243
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:45,300
The life rushes in and so anyway,
there's a bunch of funny spoof videos on

1244
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:46,134
that where it says some woman is sitting
there talking about nuclear strategy or 

1245
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:51,090
whatever,
and then the kid comes in,

1246
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:52,043
she's ironing the shirt and then she 
diffuses a bomb and then she cleans up 

1247
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,110
the socks or whatever.
It's really funny.

1248
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,130
Yeah,
there's we,

1249
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,043
we were always.
All of our information was distributed 

1250
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:07,380
to us through these very controlled 
networks,

1251
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:12,381
whether it's CBS or NBC or ABC and 
everything was very cut and dry and very

1252
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,720
professional in the way people talk.

1253
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,840
The way information was presented,
but now it's just,

1254
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,270
it's open and loose.
Like as soon as I find out about some,

1255
00:55:22,271 --> 00:55:24,990
something happened in the world,
I google it.

1256
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,850
I go,
what is it?

1257
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:26,641
What happened?
What happened?

1258
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:27,474
I Google it and then I'll go to twitter 
and then when I go to twitter it's all 

1259
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:33,750
pictures and memes and it's the dude 
with the question marks.

1260
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:35,130
You know that guys like,
you know,

1261
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,033
there's so many memes that people will 
throw up when anything crazy happens in 

1262
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:40,494
the world.
It becomes so interesting to hear the 

1263
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:47,550
news and hear commentary on the news 
from this just gigantic,

1264
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:48,384
massive humans and it's what's most 
funny or most interesting or most 

1265
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:55,350
succinct or poignant that rises to the 
top.

1266
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,210
Yep.
Yeah.

1267
00:55:57,211 --> 00:56:02,211
There's endless content to entertain a.
also just a high quality content.

1268
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:04,070
I mean,
I'm a content producer,

1269
00:56:04,071 --> 00:56:06,540
I write and so on and but I am a huge 
consumer.

1270
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:08,130
I go,
most of the people I follow on twitter,

1271
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:11,070
post articles,
most of them I want to read.

1272
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,910
So in the course of a couple of hours,
my little window popups,

1273
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,823
you know,
just spread across the top of the 

1274
00:56:15,961 --> 00:56:18,120
screen.
I want to read all of these articles and

1275
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:22,320
I plow through as many as I can.
They're pretty much like the Atlantic or

1276
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:24,160
vanity time,

1277
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,140
whatever.
They're pretty high quality,

1278
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,093
well written articles.
The problem is as a content producer 

1279
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:31,603
myself,
is that the half life of these articles 

1280
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:35,680
is so short.
You know,

1281
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,620
like when I post one of my scientific 
American columns,

1282
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,350
I put a lot of work into it and then,
you know,

1283
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:43,600
like a couple of hours later,
maybe days later gone.

1284
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:47,530
No one's talking about like,
well I put a lot of work into that,

1285
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:49,623
but it takes me out of the equation.
Like the New York Times did that huge 

1286
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,523
New York Times Sunday magazine article 
on trump's business going all the way 

1287
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:58,700
back to the seventies,
right?

1288
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,670
They,
they spent like a year working on this,

1289
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,504
like 10 journalists.
This would have been a pulitzer prize 

1290
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:06,880
winning piece.
This would have done in anybody else put

1291
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,820
trump.
Right.

1292
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,780
I mean they had his own business 
contracts and lawsuits and you know,

1293
00:57:11,781 --> 00:57:16,781
all the shady stuff going on and this 
got huge media attention for about a day

1294
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:20,500
and a half and by Sunday morning,
by Tuesday,

1295
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:21,334
no one's talking about this anymore.
It's like these guys spent a year 

1296
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:24,220
working on this.
I mean,

1297
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:25,054
what did it take to get that lawsuit 
paperwork from the Court House and they 

1298
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:32,020
had hundreds of things like that and 
it's gone like,

1299
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:32,550
whoa.

1300
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,383
Well and trump in particular,
there's so many scandals that I think 

1301
00:57:36,481 --> 00:57:38,520
we've all become numb.
Yeah,

1302
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,510
there is that too.
Yeah.

1303
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:43,140
There's so many that you just.
You get numb to it and it doesn't.

1304
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,670
It doesn't affect you.
You just go like,

1305
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,180
Huh,
he paid off at woman,

1306
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,340
whatever.
Yeah.

1307
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,330
Those are the tiny ones.
The big ones are the lawsuits,

1308
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:52,620
the businesses,
you know,

1309
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:56,040
the construction businesses where he 
didn't pay small companies.

1310
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:56,874
You didn't pay him like a tsunami.
Then these companies went under like 

1311
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,053
there's a lot of those.
There's a lot of the unethical business 

1312
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:03,540
practices.

1313
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,270
That's all in that article.
Again,

1314
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:09,390
anybody else would be done in by 
something like that.

1315
00:58:09,391 --> 00:58:11,940
Any politician except him.
It's just amazing.

1316
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,073
Well,
it's also what he represents to those 

1317
00:58:14,221 --> 00:58:15,054
people.
It doesn't necessarily have to be what 

1318
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:18,300
he really is.
It's what he represents.

1319
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,253
What he represents is like the American 
flag and eagles and so like they have 

1320
00:58:22,891 --> 00:58:27,060
this like really juvenile sense some 
folks do.

1321
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,810
Of what he is and what he represents 
this,

1322
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,550
despite all the evidence to the 
contrary,

1323
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,413
they have him in this category that he's
going to drain the swamp and these 

1324
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:40,530
liberals are just going to cry and he's 
going to make America better.

1325
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,070
Right,
and that's just,

1326
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,010
that's.
That's the side that they're on.

1327
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:47,640
They're on the make America better.
Do you think it's also people don't have

1328
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:51,330
the time to really look into this stuff.
Who could fact check these things?

1329
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:52,164
It's not just that.
It's like if you work eight hours a day 

1330
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:54,594
and you have children and hobbies and 
how much time are you really paying 

1331
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:58,930
attention to trump's ethics,
you really,

1332
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,250
really looking into it.
I really considering it before you vote,

1333
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:03,323
are you really taking into consideration
what kind of a person he is and what 

1334
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:09,150
ripple effect it would have with any of 
his policies take place?

1335
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,740
I think you're right.
People vote by their team.

1336
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:13,230
This is my team.
I'm sticking to it.

1337
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,440
Okay,
so he won the primary.

1338
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:15,100
All right.
That's.

1339
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,840
That's our guy.
We're sticking with them no matter what.

1340
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:18,940
I think there's a huge element of that.
For sure,

1341
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,083
yeah.
There's also people love to argue too 

1342
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:22,040
and as soon

1343
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,950
as they find someone as opposed to 
something that they believe in,

1344
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:26,930
they stick to their guns and they just 
hold strong.

1345
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,410
Despite all that mean,
it would take so much for people to turn

1346
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:31,244
on trump.
The real hardcore trump believers would 

1347
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:35,510
take so much for them to decide enough 
is enough.

1348
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,620
That'll be interesting to see if members
of his own party do something in 2020,

1349
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,454
probably not.
Doesn't it seem like with Fox that Fox 

1350
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:47,080
is slowly starting to shift their,
their coverage a little bit,

1351
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,760
criticizing him a little bit.
They're pushing back a little bit.

1352
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,920
Shepard Smith is pretty good on that.
He's always been that way.

1353
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:53,530
He,
yeah,

1354
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:56,060
he's always been great at that entity 
will probably be last to go.

1355
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,310
He's never going.
Never gone.

1356
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,020
He's never gone.
They have the same fucking lawyer.

1357
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,770
That's right.
The fact that that didn't say Canada.

1358
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:04,340
Right.

1359
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,650
You know that he had Michael Cohen was 
his lawyer like,

1360
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,200
oh,
Yep.

1361
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,153
Yeah.
The only thing we can have an immediate 

1362
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,020
is that there's lots of sources and you 
just have to just cross check as many as

1363
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:17,480
you can.
Don't take on any one channel.

1364
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:18,883
Well,
I wish there was a really truly 

1365
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:22,454
objective service,
like it would be wonderful if there was 

1366
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:29,480
people that were dedicated to know 
editorial slant whatsoever.

1367
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,583
Just 100 percent fact.
This is how we know the facts 

1368
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,270
regardless.
Left,

1369
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:37,910
right?
No ideological curve to it at all.

1370
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,000
Wouldn't that be fair?
That there's got to be a market to that?

1371
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:44,320
Of course they all say that that's what 
they do now.

1372
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,120
Politifact is pretty good.
They,

1373
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:50,370
they're the fact checking organization 
that they're not reporting news.

1374
01:00:50,371 --> 01:00:54,610
They're reporting on politics on the 
facts said by politicians,

1375
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,873
so that's useful and I think there's a 
market competition amongst those people 

1376
01:00:58,611 --> 01:00:59,444
to get more hits like we're fact 
checking more than the other guys are 

1377
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:02,504
fact checking.

1378
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:07,810
Although there is two different.
There was aim accuracy in media and then

1379
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:09,074
there was another one,
I forget the name and one was left 

1380
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,500
leaning and one was right leaning.
It's like,

1381
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:15,350
can I have one without a wing,
right wing or left wing?

1382
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:19,100
Yeah,
it seems like that.

1383
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:21,740
I mean,
I'm reading Jonathan hates book,

1384
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:26,450
the two books that I've been reading 
recently.

1385
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,730
One of them we discussed on the podcast 
we did on Monday,

1386
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:31,340
but the other one is the coddling of the
American mind.

1387
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,370
That's good book.
And I'm into that now and it's,

1388
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,750
it's fantastic.
And he goes,

1389
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,780
he covers this quite a bit.
Yeah.

1390
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,360
A,
you know,

1391
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:42,320
Jonathan is onto something good there 
with the Heterodox Academy,

1392
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,513
which I'm a member.
I'm a professor at Chapman University 

1393
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:49,850
and so I was the first member there and 
our university is pretty centrist.

1394
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,310
Uh,
we don't get a lot of these protests and

1395
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:54,770
microaggressions and safe space stuff.
It's,

1396
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,633
it's pretty quiet.
And Jonathan's point is that it's more 

1397
01:01:57,711 --> 01:01:58,544
of a sort of east coast,
west coast public university thing or 

1398
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,540
maybe Harvard,
that kind of thing.

1399
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,820
Middle of the country,
you don't see as much of that.

1400
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,440
Um,
but the,

1401
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:08,620
you know,
the polarization thing has gotten worse.

1402
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:12,620
You can see the polls since like 1990 to
2018 of,

1403
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,350
you know,
you ask people how,

1404
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,900
how evil are the Democrats or 
Republicans and you know,

1405
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,010
used to be tiny little differences

1406
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,700
and then they,
you know,

1407
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,060
they diverge like that now where the 
other side is not just wrong,

1408
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:24,894
but they're immoral.
They are people I do think talk radio 

1409
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:34,431
and television feeds into that or now 
social media and in the bubble there.

1410
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:36,900
So,
but on the other hand,

1411
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:37,734
the,
and the heterodox academy as 2000 

1412
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,180
members now,
professors that said,

1413
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:43,014
Yep,
I'm going to stand up against this 

1414
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:47,340
censorship on college campuses.
You,

1415
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:48,174
you were talking to Jonathan about 
people go and you had peed on and I've 

1416
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,434
known pete for many years before the 
hoax papers and I think they've had it 

1417
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:59,210
in for him for a long before the hoax 
paper.

1418
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,380
But let's explain that to people.
So this can be standalone.

1419
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,430
People goes in a James Lindsey and what 
is the Long Island pluck rose.

1420
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,800
And she wasn't on the podcast.
I didn't get to meet her,

1421
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:08,640
but they,
um,

1422
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,503
she's in England,
I believe they published a bunch of 

1423
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:16,740
preposterous papers,
like really ridiculous,

1424
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,990
like on a,
you know,

1425
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:20,310
a homeowner,
what is it?

1426
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,143
The dog park one dog rape culture and 
Park and the reach translation of a 

1427
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:30,780
chapter from mine comp,
replacing fem males with Jews,

1428
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,860
eliminate the males that kind of.
So they did one before.

1429
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:37,710
They actually,
Pete and James Lindsey did one two years

1430
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:38,544
ago on the conceptual penis.
It was called and that the penis is a 

1431
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:43,780
concept.
It's not a,

1432
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,030
it's not a real thing,
you know,

1433
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:47,430
it's just,
it's a hilarious paper.

1434
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,713
And the same month that came out,
it was published in a kind of a third 

1435
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:55,740
tier feminist studies journals.
So they get criticized like,

1436
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,310
eh,
that's not one of the big ones.

1437
01:03:57,311 --> 01:04:01,380
So you didn't really post anything but 
at the same week or that came out,

1438
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:06,330
there was another paper published on 
feminist glaciology and I thought,

1439
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,340
oh,
someone beat pete to the hoax.

1440
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,540
Oh my God,
this is totally.

1441
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,650
And I read it.
I thought this is what's hot or bulleted

1442
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,650
glaciology know study of glaciers.

1443
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,753
Oh God,
yeah.

1444
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,930
And that glaciers are very hard.
And,

1445
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,411
and,
and,

1446
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:19,500
uh,
racked and you know,

1447
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:22,290
it's all masculine and yeah.
Anyway,

1448
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,124
so I called the university that was 
affiliated with the lead author and I 

1449
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:28,160
said this is a hoax,
right?

1450
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:29,880
Come on,
just before I say anything,

1451
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:31,290
I don't want to be embarrassed.
This is a hoax,

1452
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:31,761
right?
No,

1453
01:04:31,761 --> 01:04:32,940
no.
This is real.

1454
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:36,510
It's like I can't tell the difference 
between the conceptual penis paper,

1455
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:37,344
which I know is a hoax because Pete 
wrote it and the feminist glaciology 

1456
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:41,520
paper.
That's the problem.

1457
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,473
Well,
let's explain what's happening to pete 

1458
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:47,460
now because pete was brought before a 
Portland State University.

1459
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:51,210
They,
there would be charged with,

1460
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,320
uh,
with uh,

1461
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:55,480
with faking data,
fraudulent data,

1462
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,573
fraudulent research,
faking data that he didn't go through 

1463
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:00,114
the Institutional Research Board which 
approves experiments that professors 

1464
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:05,880
want to run.
Like for example,

1465
01:05:05,881 --> 01:05:09,630
you could not do milgram's shock 
experiments where you hook people up and

1466
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,000
tell them that you're going to give 
electric shocks to somebody.

1467
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,133
They wouldn't approve that or,
or filled Zimbardo's fake jail who were 

1468
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,883
randomly assign students to be prisoners
and guards and they end up beating each 

1469
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:22,240
other up.
They would never approve that.

1470
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:25,990
Okay.
So since those sort of guerrilla theater

1471
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,350
experiments of the sixties,
the universities have tightened up,

1472
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:30,184
the kind of research are allowed to do 
even like the kinds of questions you 

1473
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:34,960
would ask in a survey.
They have to approve all of that.

1474
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:40,510
So of course Peter and James and Helen 
didn't do that because first of all,

1475
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,493
you know,
James was the primary director of this 

1476
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:44,740
thing.
He's not affiliated with the university.

1477
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:48,730
He doesn't have to answer to anybody.
Pete was affiliated with it,

1478
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:50,290
so they're getting them on that,
um,

1479
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,280
and that he didn't go through the IRB 
and get approval.

1480
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:56,080
Of course,
if you're going to tell people,

1481
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,093
if you're going to fake something,
you can't tell them ahead of time that 

1482
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,790
we're gonna fake,
of course,

1483
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,750
because it's going to get out.

1484
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,583
And then the Gig is up.
The analogy I made a the other day was 

1485
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,784
in 1971,
a stanford psychologist named David 

1486
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,970
Rosen,
who's a clinical psychologist,

1487
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:12,843
sent a bunch of his graduate students 
into mental hospitals all over the 

1488
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:16,804
country and said,
just tell him you're feeling kind of 

1489
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:23,770
blue and that you're kind of hear this 
inner voice and that,

1490
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:25,000
uh,
it's just,

1491
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:27,490
you just kind of don't feel right and 
you need some help.

1492
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,533
So they did.
They all get themselves checked in and 

1493
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:34,840
then from there on out they acted 
perfectly normal and then the goal was,

1494
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,550
let's see how long it takes you to get 
out.

1495
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,133
And so it was a study and how mental 
hospitals treat people who are 

1496
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:41,944
completely sane.
So the title of his famous paper is 

1497
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:48,700
called being sane in insane places.
So first of all,

1498
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,310
the Grad students report it's incredibly
boring.

1499
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,360
So one of them would sit there and write
essays and take notes.

1500
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:57,790
And,
and so in the psychiatrist evaluation of

1501
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:59,080
this patient,
patient is,

1502
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,150
you know,
patient exhibits,

1503
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,013
excessive writing behavior.
This is clearly an example of his 

1504
01:07:04,991 --> 01:07:09,991
erupting had bitten libidinal impulses 
from his childhood and Blah,

1505
01:07:10,101 --> 01:07:10,410
blah,
blah.

1506
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:12,690
Another one was a painter,
so she's doing paintings,

1507
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,560
but landscapes and so on.
Oh,

1508
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:15,394
patient.
You can see in the paintings the 

1509
01:07:16,391 --> 01:07:19,360
erupting emotions and they conflicts in 
her personality.

1510
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,850
They're just acting normal.
Right?

1511
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:23,043
So the point of this hoax was that 
there's something wrong with our mental 

1512
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:26,494
institutions that they can't tell the 
difference between a sane and insane 

1513
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,160
person.
What are they doing?

1514
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,120
So of course the,
the,

1515
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,013
the,
the industry got pretty upset about 

1516
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:37,540
being hoaxed.
So Rosanna and came back and said,

1517
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:38,374
okay,
in the next year I'm going to send in 

1518
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,560
some more.
Let's see if you can find him.

1519
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,800
And he didn't send anybody.
Oh Wow.

1520
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:45,641
So they're like,
okay,

1521
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:46,474
we think this guy's fake again.
They couldn't tell the difference in 

1522
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,700
their own patients and no one was even 
faking.

1523
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:52,534
So in a way,
this is kind of what Pete and James and 

1524
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:57,400
Helen did is like,
if they're sending these papers out,

1525
01:07:57,401 --> 01:08:01,090
if you can't tell,
then what are you doing in this field?

1526
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,280
Well,
people are,

1527
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,010
for whatever reason,
people are.

1528
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,270
Some people I should say are drawn to 
these nonsense ideas.

1529
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:14,500
And one of the papers,
the dog park paper got it,

1530
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:17,000
got lauded for its excellent 
scholarship,

1531
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:18,693
got praised.
It's one of the weirder ones that they 

1532
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:25,440
hoaxed I mean because it's so obviously 
preposterous when you're reading it,

1533
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:28,190
you're like,
I think it was the fat bodybuilding one.

1534
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:29,024
They get another one.
I think I won an award for the best 

1535
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:32,510
paper we've ever had.

1536
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,590
Oh
really?

1537
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:38,430
Peter and James and Helen,
they,

1538
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:42,990
they are like professional scholars in 
the grievance studies because it's.

1539
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,110
If you read those things,
it's hard to write like that.

1540
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,973
I mean it takes,
it took them a lot of practice to get 

1541
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:50,150
the jargon in the style then.
Well,

1542
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:50,984
what do you think is the.
What are the options for someone like 

1543
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:53,414
Pete?
Because if he does get fired from the 

1544
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:56,230
university,
what,

1545
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,980
what could he possibly do?
I mean,

1546
01:08:57,981 --> 01:08:59,840
what Jordan has done is pretty 
extraordinary.

1547
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:00,674
He's essentially left teaching at 
because of the controversies that he 

1548
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:06,380
went through,
he became famous.

1549
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,453
He became famous for doing podcasts and 
writing things and then his youtube 

1550
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:14,630
videos are,
they're so insightful and,

1551
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,870
and wonderful that people just got drawn
to him.

1552
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:22,220
And then they go to see him speak live.
They've made him into a monster,

1553
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:25,850
but bite censoring him by attacking him.

1554
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:29,660
They've essentially turned him into a 
global international star.

1555
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:30,913
That's right.
This is one of the best arguments 

1556
01:09:32,271 --> 01:09:34,850
against censorship is going to have the 
opposite effect.

1557
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:36,340
You wanted to.
If someone is a.

1558
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:38,020
The quality of Jordan.
Peter says,

1559
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,770
it's pretty rare.
It's pretty rare.

1560
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:40,923
I've talked to pete about this as well 
as Bret Weinstein because he had 

1561
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,920
suffered the same thing at evergreen and
he's out,

1562
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:51,020
at least he and his wife Heather got a 
payout so they have a little cushion.

1563
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:55,840
But this model,
like say I'm on Patrion or Dave Rubin,

1564
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,250
especially Jordan Peterson,
very rare.

1565
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,293
It's very rare to be able to make a 
living as a public intellectual on your 

1566
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:02,894
own.
Most public intellectuals that are not 

1567
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:07,280
in academia there with a think tank.
Uh,

1568
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:09,860
you know,
the Cato Institute or reason magazine or

1569
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,080
any of these,
there's a left wing right wing.

1570
01:10:12,081 --> 01:10:13,010
They're all over the board.

1571
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,323
Uh,
you know,

1572
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,253
it's possible they could get jobs there.
We actually have a paycheck and those 

1573
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,473
groups are usually funded by wealthy 
supporters that we like the cause and 

1574
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:28,700
here's a pile of money,
not through Patrion.

1575
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,573
Uh,
it's possible that pete say bread could 

1576
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:35,210
do this,
but it's a tough road to hoe.

1577
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:36,980
I mean,
Jordan is very rare.

1578
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:40,400
I've watched this through my whole life 
and you know,

1579
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,820
this idea of making $10,000 talk 
$50,000,

1580
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,330
$100,000 a talk,
almost nobody gets that kind of money.

1581
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,540
You know,
maybe Neil degrasse Tyson,

1582
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,230
Richard Dawkins,
maybe Carl Sagan back in the day,

1583
01:10:54,231 --> 01:10:56,300
whatever the equivalent of that would 
have been in the eighties.

1584
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,970
But that's pretty much it.
Uh,

1585
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:00,560
you know,
and there's thousands of scientists that

1586
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:01,490
would love to do that.
Like,

1587
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:02,324
yeah,
I want to go that.

1588
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,770
Well,
they're not entertaining.

1589
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,140
The thing about Jordan is he's very 
engaging,

1590
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:10,880
like he's in his words are,
it's not just their wise,

1591
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,250
it's not just,
he's a very articulate.

1592
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:18,000
There's something engaging about the 
style in which he presents these things.

1593
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:20,580
It's very captivating because very 
charismatic.

1594
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,950
I agree.
People discount that.

1595
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,053
Or I know a lot of scientists who were 
kind of jealous of Neil degrasse Tyson 

1596
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,190
or say Bill Nye.
It's like,

1597
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:30,024
oh,
I could do that.

1598
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,010
No,
I doubt that you can.

1599
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:34,440
I mean,
Neil and bill are really entertaining.

1600
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,870
They are funny.
They are engaging.

1601
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:39,690
You can't take your eyes off.
Then they're so much fun to watch.

1602
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,553
Well,
perfect example is people are not like 

1603
01:11:41,341 --> 01:11:42,780
that.
Sean Carroll's brilliant.

1604
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,200
He's really brilliant and I'm glad that 
he's doing a podcast now,

1605
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,290
but when you listen to him talk and you 
listen to neil talk,

1606
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:50,124
Neil just has this booming presence and 
this sense of drama and energy and 

1607
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,930
entertainment.
He knows how to be.

1608
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:58,900
He,
he,

1609
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,880
he knows how to deliver it in a way that
just catches you.

1610
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,713
It's fun to listen to.
And I did a public event in Australia 

1611
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:08,544
and in Melbourne or Sydney and I,
unfortunately I went before him and 

1612
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:16,650
maybe that's actually good a.
and I'm a pretty good public speaker.

1613
01:12:16,651 --> 01:12:17,940
I have a sense of,
you know,

1614
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,520
my value as a public speaker.
I'm pretty good.

1615
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:23,280
But uh,
and I never seen him speak and I,

1616
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,310
and I did my talk,
like my pretty much like my ted talk you

1617
01:12:26,311 --> 01:12:27,690
can watch online.
It's pretty entertaining.

1618
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:29,070
Okay.
So I get up and I'm done.

1619
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:29,904
I get a nice applause.
I'm feeling pretty good and then neil 

1620
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,340
gets up and he starts.
I'm like,

1621
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,353
Oh crap,
this guy is fucking good and you don't 

1622
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:37,100
want to follow that.
I know.

1623
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:39,810
I'm so glad I already went and got so 
much energy.

1624
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,410
Uh,
and,

1625
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:42,303
and yeah,
but he also has that sort of charisma 

1626
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,230
connection with the audience.

1627
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:49,860
A captures them and yeah,
I could tell afterwards,

1628
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:50,694
you know,
wrongs of people around him and you 

1629
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:52,643
know,
it's there and not very many people had 

1630
01:12:54,301 --> 01:12:56,310
that and I don't think it's something 
you can just learn.

1631
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:58,150
I think it's a temperament,
you know,

1632
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,153
I mean you can hone it and refine it,
but he can't just sort of naturally be 

1633
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,890
funny and engaging.
I think it's personality that comes out.

1634
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:07,620
I think you could certainly improve,
but I think you're right.

1635
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:12,621
I think whatever personality you have,
like he has that kind of engaging,

1636
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:13,734
fun personality and it's,
it translates very well to doing those 

1637
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:19,710
public speeches.
Since I was here a year ago,

1638
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:20,544
I saw Jordan's event at a in thousand 
oaks at the Kavli theater there in 2000 

1639
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,010
seats sold out standing room only.
And it was good.

1640
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,530
He was like different than Neil of 
course,

1641
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:34,530
but just as engaging wasn't political.

1642
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,830
A lot of people there I,
you know,

1643
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:39,030
recognized me and I could see,
you know,

1644
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,180
these aren't like right wing nuts,
these aren't young mailed,

1645
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,870
angry males.
This isn't like this at all.

1646
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:47,543
And his message was pretty 
straightforward and get your life in 

1647
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:51,090
order,
you know,

1648
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,010
this is the way life is.
It's hard.

1649
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:55,710
And he kind of went through his thing 
and it's like,

1650
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,720
all right,
that makes sense.

1651
01:13:57,721 --> 01:14:01,110
And people loved it.
Very almost no politics in it.

1652
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,560
Dave Rubin tells me he doesn't really 
get political on stage,

1653
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:07,260
so that's not the motive.
And uh,

1654
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:08,041
I think,
you know,

1655
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:10,020
life is hard enough for most people that
they,

1656
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,100
they like back to the self help thing.

1657
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,323
It's nice to be reminded,
here are a few simple things you could 

1658
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,860
do.
You get your life in order is like,

1659
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:18,181
yeah,
well,

1660
01:14:18,181 --> 01:14:19,014
yeah,
I kinda knew that I'm going to go back 

1661
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:23,340
out and do that again.
His principles are very effective to.

1662
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,130
So they're very straightforward as you 
said,

1663
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,220
but what the guy like people goes,
you know,

1664
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:28,360
to bring it back to that.
What,

1665
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,253
what could he do if he does get fired,
it's going to be very difficult for him 

1666
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:35,770
to get a job at another university.
He's obviously got roots in Portland.

1667
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:36,604
He lives there now.
It's the whole thing is he's pretty 

1668
01:14:39,761 --> 01:14:40,594
liberal.
It's not like he's a closeted 

1669
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:46,000
conservative and thereafter him,
he's definitely more liberal than me and

1670
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,750
I could tell even years ago that,
uh,

1671
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,590
they're gonna,
they're gonna go after him.

1672
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:51,424
I can tell mainly because he's so.
He puts truth and free speech ahead of 

1673
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,400
political positions.

1674
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:58,211
He'll,
he might say,

1675
01:14:58,211 --> 01:15:00,310
I'm a liberal and these are my political
positions,

1676
01:15:00,311 --> 01:15:03,460
but more important to me is the truth.
Yes.

1677
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:04,803
Okay.
Well that's not as Jonathan make point 

1678
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,953
points out in his book.
Universities are now at this divide 

1679
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:11,524
between are we here for social justice 
or are we here for truth and they're 

1680
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:17,440
having to make a decision and too many 
of them are going for it.

1681
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,303
We're here for social justice.
Well then just be honest about it 

1682
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:23,860
because that's not.
You can't bury it.

1683
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,150
Well,
not just that.

1684
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:28,420
I don't think that's an effective way to
pursue so social justice.

1685
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:29,254
If you're ignoring the truth,
you undermine your message because then 

1686
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,183
it's not like it's hidden somewhere.
It's not like people can't read into it 

1687
01:15:36,191 --> 01:15:37,024
and see exactly what you've said and how
you've supported certain causes and 

1688
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:43,180
denied the reality of others,
but the.

1689
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,010
The,
the Google memo thing.

1690
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:45,913
Yeah.
The Google memo thing was a gigantic 

1691
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:47,860
disaster.
Yeah,

1692
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,873
because ideologically people jumped on a
side and argued and and I heard the CEO 

1693
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:56,820
of Youtube talk about how damaging it 
was to women.

1694
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,000
I'm like,
what are you talking about?

1695
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:59,630
Like what are you saying?
Like what?

1696
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,890
What did he say?
He's just talking about preferences that

1697
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,400
are described by tests.
This is,

1698
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:06,243
this has all been peer reviewed,
studied papers on the differences 

1699
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:12,640
between the preferences of males versus 
females.

1700
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:13,474
It's not,
it's not like a value assessment at all 

1701
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:17,584
and in fact,
not only that he put into his paper a 

1702
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:21,694
page and a half of recommendations of 
how to get certain women interested in 

1703
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:26,104
tech and perhaps you could recruit 
certain way and make it more palatable 

1704
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:34,870
or exciting to them and that's not a 
sexist screened at all.

1705
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,381
No,
no,

1706
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:35,860
no.

1707
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,740
There's online.
There's a really good debate with Steve.

1708
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,120
Steven pinker in,
in a,

1709
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:44,110
in a feminist scholar at Harvard and 
Steve has all his slides up there and he

1710
01:16:44,111 --> 01:16:47,260
just goes all through all the different 
things that are in that Google memo.

1711
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,860
This is before the Google memo,
May,

1712
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:52,150
maybe James more gut,
some of that from pinker's lecture,

1713
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:52,984
but it's,
it's,

1714
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:53,823
it's pretty solid stuff.
There was nothing in inflammatory about 

1715
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:57,754
the debate.
This is kind of normal scientific 

1716
01:16:59,111 --> 01:16:59,771
debate,
you know,

1717
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:00,604
here's a study that shows this well,
but there's this other study and then 

1718
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:04,720
they go at it.
Okay.

1719
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:06,520
And to story,
we're not saying women are better,

1720
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,830
men are better.
That doesn't happen.

1721
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,290
Unfortunately.

1722
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:12,590
The here,
if I was [inaudible] boss,

1723
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:13,723
here's what I would do because a lot of 
us have written letters in support of 

1724
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:18,230
Pete and you can kind of see what's 
about to happen.

1725
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,250
Let's just drop this whole thing.
Let him keep his job,

1726
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,950
keep our mouths shut because this is 
going to backfire on us.

1727
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,660
Big Time lag did with evergreens.
Yeah.

1728
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,900
Or with the Google memo.
So that's what I would do.

1729
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,340
Backfire on the Google memo.
I mean we've realized that they've got a

1730
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:37,880
preposterous ideology over there.
Now we know that maybe their stock price

1731
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:40,760
hasn't gone down.
Actually it affected them very much and,

1732
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,580
and,
and many more people support it.

1733
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:44,414
Many more people who.
It's one of those things where you hear 

1734
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:50,270
one version of it and that version 
sticks,

1735
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,233
you know,
it's like,

1736
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:55,880
you know,
this is the version is he's a sexist,

1737
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:56,953
you know,
the sex is Google memo and then that's 

1738
01:17:58,491 --> 01:17:59,324
all I need.

1739
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:03,110
The Google memo is very sexist,
very anti female.

1740
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,480
And being.
There's many,

1741
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,314
many people who support the idea that 
something that was sexist was removed 

1742
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:10,934
from Google.
They've made it a safer environment for 

1743
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:13,214
women.
Right?

1744
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,950
Yep.
But did they idle,

1745
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,780
you know,
I don't know what this doesn't seem like

1746
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:18,614
they did.
It seems like they made it an 

1747
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:22,270
environment where you have to be careful
about facts.

1748
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,870
Right?
Because again,

1749
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:24,704
it's not a value assessment of women.
If women choose to go into the medical 

1750
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:31,580
fields,
more women are physicians,

1751
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:32,414
more women.
There's many fields that like 

1752
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:38,390
disproportionately attract women.
That's not a negative value assessment.

1753
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:40,430
That's just people are different,
you know,

1754
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:41,323
I don't,
I don't want to do with certain people 

1755
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:44,870
do because I'm different than them.
I don't.

1756
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:46,640
I'm not attracted to those fields.
Right.

1757
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:47,653
It's fascinating to find out why people 
are attracted and when you see that 

1758
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:51,800
there's actual.

1759
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:57,080
There's just actual statistics in terms 
of what fields men are more attracted to

1760
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:58,520
or what fields women are more attracted 
to.

1761
01:18:58,670 --> 01:18:59,503
Now on the other hand,
if there's a reason why women aren't 

1762
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:05,150
attracted those fields because they get 
harassed when they go into them,

1763
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,980
well that should be demonstrated and 
that's an APP,

1764
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,590
obviously a bad thing and that should be
addressed.

1765
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:10,820
Yeah,
absolutely.

1766
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,250
Totally.
That's not what he's talking about.

1767
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:17,570
And James Demore is like a very kind,
soft spoken.

1768
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,010
He's great.
He's a great guy.

1769
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:24,950
He's very introverted.
He's a kind guy and he's on the spectrum

1770
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:25,784
somewhere.
There's no way you'd look at James 

1771
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:28,400
Amaury got fares.
The patriarchy.

1772
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:31,670
Yeah.
He's a nice guy and they said to him,

1773
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:35,690
if you have any input on these things 
and feel like you can help,

1774
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,100
please contribute.
And he's like,

1775
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,330
okay.
So he's.

1776
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,430
That's what he is.
He's a,

1777
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,240
he's a fucking software engineer.

1778
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,340
He sat down and looked at all the data 
and compiled it and he's saying,

1779
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:47,174
well actually it seems like this is the 
reason why women are more attracted to 

1780
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:50,084
other jobs and this is the reason why 
men are more attracted to these fields 

1781
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:54,860
and they're like,
sexist lead.

1782
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:55,331
He's like,
no,

1783
01:19:55,331 --> 01:19:55,551
no,
no,

1784
01:19:55,551 --> 01:19:55,801
no,
no,

1785
01:19:55,801 --> 01:19:56,960
no.
These are the studies.

1786
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,033
This is what you're asking me to do,
that the concern that if the science 

1787
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:02,324
doesn't come out a certain way,
then people won't be treated equally is 

1788
01:20:05,151 --> 01:20:08,640
a bad idea because then you're going to 
force the science to be distorted

1789
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,160
if it doesn't match your political 
ideology,

1790
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:11,994
and that's so whether trans is natural 
or whatever percentages or how old you 

1791
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:19,540
have to be before you get trans surgery 
and the hormones or whatever that.

1792
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,300
That's a raging debate right now,
but under,

1793
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:23,303
under underlying that debate is like we 
have to make it come out in a way that 

1794
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,010
trans people are treated equally.
It's like,

1795
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,700
no,
no.

1796
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,750
They should be treated equally anyway,
regardless of what the science says,

1797
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,580
but,
um,

1798
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,360
that,
that's,

1799
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,260
that's a problem now.
Now the problem for people,

1800
01:20:39,261 --> 01:20:44,261
a peed and Brett like joining a think 
tank is almost all these think tanks are

1801
01:20:44,461 --> 01:20:45,294
politically affiliated left or right.
You have to bet and therefore you have 

1802
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:49,524
to kind of tow the political line.
This is our ideology in this thing tank 

1803
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:54,144
and you're going to write white papers 
and op eds and send them out with our 

1804
01:20:57,121 --> 01:20:59,130
kind of slant,
the problem with that as well,

1805
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,650
but what if I disagree with this and 
this and this here?

1806
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,050
Well then you can't work here.
Something like that.

1807
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,480
So that's the problem with those.
Is that

1808
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:09,490
the only option today when you see that,
I mean,

1809
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:13,600
I know he's not Jordan and you know,
there's very few people like Jordan,

1810
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:16,900
but Sam Harris is also able to do these 
species very compelling as well.

1811
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,440
He's doing a lot of public speeches and 
doing these big,

1812
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:21,303
big events.
There's more opportunity to do 

1813
01:21:24,191 --> 01:21:25,024
alternative things now than they have 
ever been before and I would hope that 

1814
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,630
that becomes available to look.
I hope Pete just keeps his job,

1815
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:35,020
but if he can't keep his job at Portland
state,

1816
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,130
I would hope that some other avenue,
some other,

1817
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,020
some other path as possible.
Yep.

1818
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:42,530
It might be.
You know,

1819
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,000
you never know,
but you know,

1820
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:46,130
you put a date on the calendar and you 
tell the world,

1821
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,560
did they come?
Do they pay 10 bucks a ticket,

1822
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:50,300
50 bucks a ticket,
$100 a ticket.

1823
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:55,850
Not many people can fill a 3000 seat 
auditorium or a 500 seat auditorium in

1824
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,413
do is do a lecture series on the 
Grievance Studies and have the three of 

1825
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:06,180
them onstage talk about how silly these 
things were.

1826
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,113
Yeah.
If they could put that together as a 

1827
01:22:07,961 --> 01:22:11,170
theatrical presentation,
it would really be funny because there's

1828
01:22:11,171 --> 01:22:14,040
some hot alaria subjects covered.
Oh,

1829
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,580
they have to do is just read with 
porcelain

1830
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,690
[inaudible] and we're in here and we 
were talking about these things.

1831
01:22:18,691 --> 01:22:21,000
We were crying laughing.
It was really,

1832
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:21,834
really funny stuff.
That's actually probably the best path 

1833
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:24,520
for him.
Yeah.

1834
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,980
Is to put together some sort of a public
show.

1835
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,890
They should do a book and then have a 
book to show.

1836
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:30,903
Yeah.
And then maybe even a TV documentary 

1837
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:33,611
about it.
Well,

1838
01:22:33,611 --> 01:22:36,070
if they have somebody making a document,
that's a good start.

1839
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:36,973
And when I was in College at Pepperdine,
g Gordon Liddy and Timothy leary did a 

1840
01:22:42,161 --> 01:22:43,870
stage show.
Wow.

1841
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,753
And they were.
And they were touring the country doing 

1842
01:22:46,511 --> 01:22:47,200
this.
Yeah.

1843
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:51,400
And it was at Ucla,
so I drove down and saw it and it was so

1844
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:52,570
entertaining.
I mean,

1845
01:22:52,571 --> 01:22:53,404
g dot Gordon Liddy,
he's the man there with his three piece 

1846
01:22:55,631 --> 01:22:56,464
suit and he's got his gun and Timothy 
leary comes out in his boat shoes and 

1847
01:23:00,191 --> 01:23:03,490
his flower shirt and,
but they had it kind of scripted,

1848
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,010
but it was well scripted in a way that

1849
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,843
seemed kind of spontaneous,
but it was really funny and educational 

1850
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:13,990
about how the government works and 
freedom versus security and rights.

1851
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:17,140
And uh,
I thought that was brilliant and I think

1852
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:17,750
they did,
I don't know,

1853
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,980
like a 50 city tour of that g Gordon 
Liddy was on fear factor.

1854
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,240
He was.
Oh,

1855
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:23,440
I didn't know that.
Interesting.

1856
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:25,240
Did he hold his hand above a flame?
No,

1857
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:26,074
he didn't.
But we did hang him by his ankles and 

1858
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:30,850
slam them into a pool like over and over
and over again.

1859
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:32,590
It was,
I forget what the stunt was,

1860
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:33,311
but I was like,
Jesus,

1861
01:23:33,311 --> 01:23:35,830
this guy's old to be doing this.
But,

1862
01:23:35,831 --> 01:23:36,730
uh,
he did,

1863
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:38,890
uh,
some physical challenges.

1864
01:23:38,891 --> 01:23:43,891
I remember thinking like this guy is 
more fit and more active than most young

1865
01:23:44,741 --> 01:23:45,574
people,
and he was deep into his sixties at the 

1866
01:23:46,481 --> 01:23:47,314
time when we had them on fear factor,
the only thing that screwed them up was 

1867
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:50,584
in the end,
the final stunt was a driving stunt and 

1868
01:23:53,321 --> 01:23:54,154
it was at night and unfortunately his 
eyes are not that good and he just 

1869
01:23:57,521 --> 01:23:58,354
couldn't see well without glasses and so
as he was driving the car slammed into 

1870
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:02,674
something or something.

1871
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,733
You know what it was?
What do you got them there now it's all 

1872
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,913
right,
but a chance to talk to him for a few 

1873
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,950
days hanging out with them.
Very interesting guy.

1874
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:14,410
You have a strong mind.
Yep,

1875
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,720
that's right.
He had a talk show back in the nineties.

1876
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:17,554
I was on when my first book came out.
White people believe weird things and I 

1877
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:23,140
talked about conspiracies there and so 
he asked me,

1878
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,310
well,
tell me about conspiracies.

1879
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:24,641
They.
Well,

1880
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:27,010
you tell me about conspiracy.
You know more than I do.

1881
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,810
He knows about real ones.
Real ones.

1882
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,644
Yeah.
That is my number one beef with 

1883
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:33,340
conspiracy theories,
is that when you,

1884
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,700
you know,
some of them that are so preposterous,

1885
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:39,220
like whether it's flatter,
if or what were the really dumb ones,

1886
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,054
there's a base on the opposite side of 
the moon and Nasa knows about all the 

1887
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,210
aliens are living in New Mexico,
the lizard people.

1888
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:50,250
The problem with those is they undermine
actual conspiracies when you,

1889
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:54,430
when you hear about preposterous things 
and they they get,

1890
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,370
they get categorized as conspiracy 
theories.

1891
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,930
Then when someone says,
well,

1892
01:24:58,931 --> 01:25:00,850
there's a conspiracy about this.
Well,

1893
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:01,684
it's already a tainted idea because the 
word conspiracy is connected to 

1894
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:05,850
nonsense,
right?

1895
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:08,830
Because there's so many nonsense 
conspiracy theories.

1896
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:10,510
It's hard to recognize,
oh,

1897
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:12,490
something like Enron that really did 
happen.

1898
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,950
Like there,
there is the northwoods papers,

1899
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:17,320
there's a bunch of like legitimate 
conspiracies.

1900
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:18,071
You're like,
wow,

1901
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,630
you know,
you find out about the Gulf of Tonkin.

1902
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:20,180
You're like,
well,

1903
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:21,590
they really did that.
Yup,

1904
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,520
that's right.
Yeah.

1905
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:26,800
I'm writing a paper now and white people
believe conspiracies and so I go through

1906
01:25:26,801 --> 01:25:28,600
the whole list of all the psychological 
things,

1907
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:33,040
but I am with the whole second half is 
because a lot of them are true and there

1908
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:35,800
are reasons we should be suspicious that
just think of,

1909
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,010
uh,
the wiki leaks or the Panama papers,

1910
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:41,043
the Panama papers.
Here's all these billionaires opening 

1911
01:25:42,521 --> 01:25:44,350
these shell corporations keeping their 
mind.

1912
01:25:44,351 --> 01:25:46,240
They're not paying tech.
That's a conspiracy,

1913
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:48,580
you know,
by definition to them are people meeting

1914
01:25:48,581 --> 01:25:52,510
in secret to conspire to benefit 
themselves that harms the public good or

1915
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:56,530
other people.
This happens a lot and the US government

1916
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:57,364
in corporations,
there's a reason we should be 

1917
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:01,450
suspicious.
There is.

1918
01:26:01,451 --> 01:26:04,000
But what is it about people want to look
for

1919
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,500
a conspiracy and everything,
even if it's,

1920
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,120
you know,
they want to see,

1921
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:09,643
they want to see contreras behind jets 
as evidence of the government spraying 

1922
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:16,730
things in the sky to control our minds.
Right?

1923
01:26:16,731 --> 01:26:21,050
So the sort of Baloney detection tools 
are not too finely tuned.

1924
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,550
Uh,
the problem is,

1925
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:25,640
is that we're a tendency is to look for 
some global,

1926
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:30,770
simple explanation for complex systems.
So while we all kind of recognize,

1927
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:31,604
yes,
we know corporations cheat and stock 

1928
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:37,790
traders trade with insight information,
but that's kind of small and mundane.

1929
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:42,791
It's not very interesting.
Global domination of the world know this

1930
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:43,581
is,
Ooh,

1931
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:44,430
who's doing that?
You know,

1932
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,700
so then it becomes like a Dan Brown 
novel.

1933
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,810
It's more compelling as a narrative 
story about how the world works.

1934
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:51,663
It's super simple.
There's these 12 guys in London called 

1935
01:26:53,061 --> 01:26:55,840
the Illuminati and they're calling the 
shots and they're,

1936
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:57,500
you know,
they're controlling Oldenburg,

1937
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,440
the builder Burgers,
the Rockefellers,

1938
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,283
the last child,
the Illuminati CFR new world order 

1939
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,600
towards Soros is doing it.

1940
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,690
He's a part of it.
Totally.

1941
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:11,240
It's what I hear.
He's number 13 in the Illuminati.

1942
01:27:11,241 --> 01:27:14,850
There's so many different competing 
theories to so,

1943
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:16,910
so,
so a couple of criteria.

1944
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:18,380
The more people that have to be 
involved,

1945
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:21,920
the less likely it is to be true.
It was Gordon Liddy that told me this,

1946
01:27:21,921 --> 01:27:22,560
that,
you know,

1947
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,600
it was,
it.

1948
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,493
Three people can keep a secret if two of
them are dead now people can't keep 

1949
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:29,930
their mouth shut.
And also he would know because he worked

1950
01:27:29,931 --> 01:27:32,000
in government.
Most people are pretty incompetent.

1951
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,133
So the idea that you can orchestrate a 
thousand people to and each of them is 

1952
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:36,374
going to go out and do this one thing at
9:00 Tuesday and it's all gonna come 

1953
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:43,010
together just perfect because impossible
and he should know.

1954
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:43,844
I mean they couldn't even break into the
Watergate hotel room to get these 

1955
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:48,290
papers.
What's also,

1956
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:50,330
who is getting into government the first
place?

1957
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,390
Are they the geniuses of the world,
the heads of their field?

1958
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:56,210
Or are they people that just decided to 
get into a job?

1959
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:57,620
You know,
and this is,

1960
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:00,560
this is a good percentage of the people 
that are involved in government.

1961
01:28:00,561 --> 01:28:01,394
If those people know as well,
these unexceptional folks that are just 

1962
01:28:04,001 --> 01:28:05,960
like uninspired.
And there were also,

1963
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:08,120
they're like,
they,

1964
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:09,203
that's the air quotes day that they 
really have the kind of wherewithal to 

1965
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:18,760
control the whole world mind control.
That's my favorite mind control psyops.

1966
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,030
I mean,
this idea that,

1967
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:20,960
um,
you know,

1968
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,150
operatives went into the World Trade 
Center buildings,

1969
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,073
both of them,
two of the most tightly controlled and 

1970
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:27,644
secure buildings in the world and under 
the pretense of working on the 

1971
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:33,950
elevators,
managed to get into a breakthrough,

1972
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:38,150
the drywall to get into the main beams,
to wrap them up in explosive devices.

1973
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:41,110
This thermite stuff,
and this would,

1974
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:43,170
you know,
we know how long it takes to demolish a,

1975
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,920
like a stadium or a big building,
you know that they work,

1976
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:49,550
they're there for weeks or months 
preparing all the explosive devices.

1977
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:52,700
Somehow they did this in the World Trade
Center building without anyone noticing.

1978
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,820
Not to mention all the people that 
worked on this,

1979
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:56,683
they never told their spouses are 
friends or buddies or what they were 

1980
01:28:59,811 --> 01:29:02,010
doing or they didn't mention it to 
anybody.

1981
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,843
They don't want to go on CNN or 60 
minutes ago I saw something and here's 

1982
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:07,590
what happened.
Nobody.

1983
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:08,663
Well,
anytime you have a gigantic catastrophe 

1984
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:13,350
like that,
just a gigantic,

1985
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:16,710
horrific event,
there's so many emotions.

1986
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:17,753
There's so much chaos.
There's so much going on that you're 

1987
01:29:20,251 --> 01:29:21,084
going to get a bunch of really wacky eye
witness accounts because people just 

1988
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,324
aren't good at remembering things when,
when they're under extreme duress and 

1989
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:31,560
mrs fact they hear things,
they remember explosions,

1990
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:32,543
they see things that aren't necessarily 
what was really in front of them and 

1991
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,193
that's just the human memory is one of 
the most flawed ways of gathering 

1992
01:29:41,881 --> 01:29:42,930
information,
right?

1993
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:45,510
It's terrible.
We have terrible memories,

1994
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:46,980
right?
And everything.

1995
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:47,993
Once something happens,
then you back up and look for all the 

1996
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:50,923
sort of pregnant moments leading up to 
it that otherwise would have been a 

1997
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:55,120
noticeable like,
uh,

1998
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,030
at the JFK assassination.

1999
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,890
There's a famous story about the 
umbrella man.

2000
01:29:59,060 --> 01:29:59,860
Yeah.
Okay.

2001
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:02,160
So there is,
it's a clear sunny day.

2002
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:05,610
Why does he have an umbrella?
And for decades there you go online,

2003
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:06,444
you can see these examples of how the 
umbrella could have been turned into a 

2004
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:12,050
rifle.
And then he shot like that and,

2005
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:13,401
and it.
Anyway,

2006
01:30:13,401 --> 01:30:15,990
somebody finally tracked this guy down 
decades later and he said,

2007
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:19,500
I was out there protesting Kennedy.
The umbrella was a protest.

2008
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,223
And that stems back to Neville 
Chamberlain coming back after meeting 

2009
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:27,690
with Hitler before Hitler annexed,
I think it was the sedate and land.

2010
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:29,740
And he came back and said,
you know,

2011
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,653
holding his umbrella here I had here,
Hitler sign this paper and promised he 

2012
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:34,074
wouldn't do anything more bad.
And so the umbrella became a symbol of 

2013
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,530
um,
you know,

2014
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:43,210
sort of caving into evil people or you 
know,

2015
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,090
uh,
what's the word for it?

2016
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:45,671
Uh,
you know,

2017
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:46,504
appeasement.
How convoluted do you think people are 

2018
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:49,590
going to get that?
And I dunno,

2019
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,483
he's out.
So this is what he said I had my 

2020
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:53,850
umbrella to because I didn't like what 
Kennedy was dealing with,

2021
01:30:53,851 --> 01:30:56,550
Castro and the Cubans.
Okay.

2022
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:57,384
So in other words,
the umbrella meant nothing in terms of 

2023
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:01,330
the assassination.
Right?

2024
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:03,840
And this is true.
So like nine slash 11.

2025
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:04,674
Oh,
there was this little puff of smoke or 

2026
01:31:06,031 --> 01:31:08,100
somebody found this passport over here,
this little thing.

2027
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,080
All those little things.
Really.

2028
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:11,550
It's just randomness.
Well,

2029
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:15,720
the other thing is the people that want 
to think that the windows blowing out or

2030
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:16,554
indicative of some sort of a controlled 
demolition or the building's caving in 

2031
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:21,883
it,
the floor pancaking it pushes the air 

2032
01:31:23,161 --> 01:31:24,070
out.
Yeah.

2033
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:25,293
Yeah.
Well,

2034
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,213
it's.
There's never been a controlled 

2035
01:31:26,971 --> 01:31:30,600
demolition that went from the top down 
either like the way they did it.

2036
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,590
They all go from the bottom up,
right?

2037
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,433
Yeah.
It's the one that looks crazy as a 

2038
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,970
building seven tower seven.
That one looks crazy.

2039
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,833
It does,
but it burned for like eight hours or 

2040
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:45,270
something and yeah,
that one's just slightly fuzzier,

2041
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:50,040
but explosive experts tell me that it's 
fully explicable by burning all day.

2042
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:53,130
Well also when you see the images of it 
collapsing,

2043
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:53,964
what you don't see is the interior 
structure had collapsed previously and 

2044
01:31:57,901 --> 01:31:58,734
there's video of that when you watched 
the interior cave in and that as this 

2045
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:05,260
fire was burning because apparently 
there was obviously,

2046
01:32:05,261 --> 01:32:08,470
I don't know what really what happened,
but there was diesel tanks apparently in

2047
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:10,960
the basement and the diesel fuel at 
burn,

2048
01:32:10,961 --> 01:32:13,840
incredibly hot in the whole inside of it
all.

2049
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:14,674
The structure had been completely 
weakened and then as it collapsed it 

2050
01:32:17,861 --> 01:32:22,450
just all gave out.
It just happened to be a shit design.

2051
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:26,080
If I was the guy who owned that 
building,

2052
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:26,914
I would sue everybody.
I mean he got his money back I guess 

2053
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:32,830
because there's some insurance money,
but that what a terrible design.

2054
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,233
There was some issue with the legal 
insurance payout to the owner of the 

2055
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:39,963
World Trade Center buildings.
Whether this was like one event or two 

2056
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:47,521
events are one building or two.
What was the difference was between like

2057
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:50,170
8 billion,
$16,000,000,000 payout or something like

2058
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:51,004
that.
How do they get people to get into that 

2059
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:55,000
new building?
I'd be like,

2060
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:56,110
fuck you.
I'm not.

2061
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,970
I'm not renting an office in this 
building,

2062
01:32:57,971 --> 01:32:59,800
this building.
They blew it up in [inaudible] 93.

2063
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:03,250
They blew it up again in 2001 get out of
here with this shit.

2064
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,830
I'm not taking chances of this new ass 
building.

2065
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:06,664
What is it?
The freedom tower or something like 

2066
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:09,610
that.
It's just a big old bullseye.

2067
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:10,510
Yup.

2068
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:11,500
Yeah.
I haven't been in it yet.

2069
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:13,900
I've been around it,
but it's not even that big.

2070
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,010
Well,
it's.

2071
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:16,840
I think it's just.
I think it's taller than the.

2072
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,830
It's not.
It's not as big as the original towers.

2073
01:33:20,831 --> 01:33:22,320
Right?
I think it is as tall it isn't.

2074
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,380
Yeah,
I think so.

2075
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:24,430
Yeah.
I thought it was shorter.

2076
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:26,620
It's definitely not as big as the one in
Dubai.

2077
01:33:26,621 --> 01:33:28,450
The Dubai ones,
like a half a mile,

2078
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:30,250
right?
Isn't something crazy like that.

2079
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:33,070
I don't know how tall is the tallest 
building?

2080
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,800
It is.
I just went to their,

2081
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,370
the one world trade center leasing page,
it says at 1,776 feet.

2082
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:40,204
One World Trade Center is the tallest l,
e e d gold certified building in the 

2083
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,210
Western Hemisphere.
That's not good enough.

2084
01:33:46,211 --> 01:33:48,120
Whatever America,
we need to believe,

2085
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:50,290
number one,
and we need to go straight to the moon.

2086
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,440
In the solar system.
Yeah.

2087
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,920
We need to take an elevator right to the
fucking moon.

2088
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:56,830
Right.
Outside of space.

2089
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,250
How is that possible?
Can they build a building that's so high

2090
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:02,820
that it goes into space one?
Yeah.

2091
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,290
I don't think so because structurally it
wouldn't hold,

2092
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,450
went up,
so can shape of a pyramid.

2093
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:11,050
Well,
it's like why are trees 100 feet tall?

2094
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:12,880
Because the material would just 
collapse.

2095
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:15,910
I don't think he could have it strong.
It'd have to be so fat.

2096
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:16,541
Oh,
that's right.

2097
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:18,520
Japan was going to build that space 
elevator.

2098
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,121
Oh,
look at it.

2099
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:19,954
You Got Jack with the popups.
Japan takes tiny first step towards 

2100
01:34:23,191 --> 01:34:24,024
space.
Elevator.

2101
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,420
Yeah.
You can fuck off.

2102
01:34:25,421 --> 01:34:26,254
I'm not getting nothing.
It would take a few years before I'm 

2103
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:31,720
willing to climate or that soccer.
But um,

2104
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,273
so the other problem with conspiracies 
just get back there for a moment is the 

2105
01:34:35,381 --> 01:34:37,300
problem of anomalies.
What do you do with anomalies?

2106
01:34:37,301 --> 01:34:38,470
This is true in all science.

2107
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:43,330
No theory explains every single thing 
that's out there that we want to study.

2108
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,583
There's always going to be some quirky 
thing that the main theory here that 

2109
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:49,930
explains all these things here.
It doesn't account for that.

2110
01:34:50,490 --> 01:34:51,610
Okay.
What did we do with that?

2111
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:52,743
Well,
my joke is you assign it to a Grad 

2112
01:34:53,591 --> 01:34:55,420
student.
They let them figure it out.

2113
01:34:56,050 --> 01:35:00,770
But what outsiders mistake is that,
well my theory explains this,

2114
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:01,604
a little anomaly,
so therefore it should replace this 

2115
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:06,860
theory and so people like Neil and Sean 
Carroll,

2116
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:10,340
Lawrence Krauss,
Michio Kaku has to web pages.

2117
01:35:10,341 --> 01:35:11,174
One is a link on his webpage.
If you have an alternative theory of 

2118
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:15,470
physics,
go to this page.

2119
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,633
So they go there and it has your theory 
has to explain all of these things over 

2120
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:24,881
here that are theory currently explains 
and your whatever your said anomaly is.

2121
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,920
And of course they can't.

2122
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:27,763
So it's not that scientists are 
dogmatically closed minded to the 

2123
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:32,054
anomalies.
It's that we can't explain everything 

2124
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,470
and you don't have to do anything with 
that.

2125
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,333
Just just leave it there.
Maybe eventually they'll pile up and 

2126
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:44,090
there'll be a new theory like with 
Einstein's relativity.

2127
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:47,450
Okay.
There was enough anomalies here like the

2128
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,313
orbit of mercury and a few other things.
And so we have to modify Newtonian 

2129
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:53,510
physics a little bit.
Okay.

2130
01:35:53,511 --> 01:35:55,880
That happens.
But for the most part.

2131
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:58,340
And so conspiracies are filled with 
these things.

2132
01:35:58,341 --> 01:36:01,820
Like the moment something big happens,
you go back and okay,

2133
01:36:01,821 --> 01:36:04,190
but there was this weird thing here.
How he explained that,

2134
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,950
I don't know,
we don't have to explain everything.

2135
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:08,653
Do you know that there's a growing 
movement that think that the space is 

2136
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:14,250
fake spaces fake?
No.

2137
01:36:14,251 --> 01:36:16,190
Is this different than the flat earth 
rule?

2138
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:19,250
Hashtag [inaudible] basis.
Fake Hashtag spaces.

2139
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,680
Fave is people that are so fucking 
stupid.

2140
01:36:21,681 --> 01:36:24,560
The flat earthers kicked him out.
Oh my God.

2141
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:27,030
For real flat earthers kicked out the 
space.

2142
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:31,730
Fake people spaces fake is like God.
They are the most skeptical.

2143
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:33,710
So what would be the upper atmosphere 
would be the edge.

2144
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:35,180
It's all bullshit.
It's all fake.

2145
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:38,030
It's the end and it's tied in some weird
way to religion,

2146
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:41,000
which is really interesting because even
the flat earth people,

2147
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:41,834
there's a tremendous amount of them that
are extremely religious and they talk 

2148
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:47,270
about the firmament and the Bible book,
the Bible,

2149
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:48,104
and that this is a.
This is what's really going on is that 

2150
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:54,290
they're trying to keep us from the 
knowledge that God has created.

2151
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:59,291
This place is a very special place and 
so by pretending that it's round,

2152
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,470
they somehow or another are controlling 
us.

2153
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:05,960
We're thinking that we're not 
exceptional and we're not lucky.

2154
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,113
Space is fake.
They're using a video from Ryan 

2155
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:11,830
Gosling's movie he just made about Neil 
Armstrong.

2156
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:13,900
First Man on the moon.
Just be like this.

2157
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:14,411
Look,
look.

2158
01:37:14,411 --> 01:37:16,420
Here's proof.
It's a fake everything.

2159
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:19,960
They are making a movie because 
literally the way they made the movie is

2160
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,660
that's evidence that it's fake.
That because he's wearing it.

2161
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:23,733
I don't know if maybe this person 
doesn't recognize that as being Ryan 

2162
01:37:25,751 --> 01:37:28,740
gosling right there.
Scott got NASA suit on.

2163
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:32,680
Maybe it's just a troll account.
This is how NASA fix everything.

2164
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:35,410
This is the video I was talking about 
guys.

2165
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:40,480
Now you know it's all a big act tab.
Click on spaces fake though.

2166
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,133
This is what I'm on.
I'm on the whole click on it because 

2167
01:37:43,721 --> 01:37:45,640
there's a bunch of other mom on that 
thread.

2168
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,990
There's a tremendous amount of people 
that literally believe that space is not

2169
01:37:49,991 --> 01:37:50,824
real.
Google a video of a buzz Aldrin and how 

2170
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,040
deals with the

2171
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,930
no Mooney's that we never went to the 
moon.

2172
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,090
There's a video buzz Aldrin punching a 
guy.

2173
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:03,030
That guy,
I had dinner with that guy.

2174
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,810
Did the guy who punched.
Yeah,

2175
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,960
I was a firm believer that we never went
to the moon.

2176
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:09,630
This is what happened.
I watched that.

2177
01:38:09,631 --> 01:38:13,530
A Fox documentary,
the moon conspiracy theory did we go and

2178
01:38:13,531 --> 01:38:14,610
I was like,
Holy Shit.

2179
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:16,800
Because it was on television and I was.
And this was

2180
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:21,270
96,
97.

2181
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:23,070
I remember I went to work and I told 
everybody,

2182
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:24,690
you got to see this documentary.
It crazy.

2183
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:26,580
We never went to the moon.
And uh,

2184
01:38:26,581 --> 01:38:30,380
I have watched that one and I watched 
this guys.

2185
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,630
What is his name?
Artsy fartsy liberal.

2186
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:34,973
So I had dinner with them.
He absolutely believes that we never 

2187
01:38:36,781 --> 01:38:38,730
went to the moon.
Not 100 percent believes it.

2188
01:38:38,731 --> 01:38:39,960
I don't know if he still believes it.

2189
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,030
I think he's like a cab driver or 
something.

2190
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:42,864
Now he got,
he was involved in the news or local 

2191
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,273
television or something like that 
backwards from then he released a 

2192
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,980
documentary called the funny,
a funny thing happened on the way to the

2193
01:38:52,981 --> 01:38:55,110
moon.
And in his documentary,

2194
01:38:55,111 --> 01:38:55,944
one of the things he did have his really
interesting footage of the lunar module 

2195
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:05,780
where it looks like they're faking a 
shot of them being really far out,

2196
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:09,720
but then when they remove this,
cover,

2197
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:12,000
the covers from all the windows that 
were inside the,

2198
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,310
the um,
the lunar,

2199
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,950
not the lunar module.
What is the one that the orbiter,

2200
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:18,683
it really looks like they're in low 
earth orbit and this is like the main 

2201
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:22,883
thing pointing to that,
like they couldn't get out of low earth 

2202
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:26,043
orbit.
Then there was also the fact that they 

2203
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:29,334
lost all of the telemetry data,
which was the binary ones and zeroes 

2204
01:39:34,801 --> 01:39:37,500
that show the position of the lunar 
module at every stage.

2205
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,620
There was a bunch of different things.
The fact that no one wanted,

2206
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:43,920
especially Neil Armstrong,
he became a recluse.

2207
01:39:43,921 --> 01:39:47,820
Never wanted to talk about it.
You go and watch the press conference,

2208
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:49,650
the press conference.
They look very shady,

2209
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,990
look like they're completely not like 
that.

2210
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,510
He talks to everybody.
He was a drunk for a long time though.

2211
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,493
He was a.
He was very depressed and had when he 

2212
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,310
became an alcoholic after the moon 
landing.

2213
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,360
And the idea is that in conspiracy 
circles from talking as them,

2214
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,510
the idea is that he got over it after 
awhile and needed to make a living.

2215
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:09,720
Now talks about it constantly.
But Neil Armstrong never did.

2216
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:13,440
The thing that's compelling is that 
there was,

2217
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:17,010
there were some,
there's some faking going on.

2218
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:21,210
If you look at Gemini was in Gemini 
Fifteen,

2219
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,700
Michael Collins,
there's an image of Michael Collins when

2220
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:26,800
they were testing some of the space,
uh,

2221
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,250
walking stuff and some of the,
uh,

2222
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,170
some of the things that they would do 
to,

2223
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,780
to walk outside of a spaceship.

2224
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:34,930
Um,
they,

2225
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:35,763
they had them all strapped up with 
cables and they're just experimented 

2226
01:40:38,131 --> 01:40:38,964
with these things.
They took that photograph and then 

2227
01:40:41,371 --> 01:40:45,240
blacked out the background,
probably some overzealous pr agent.

2228
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,330
And they were like in the pool right 
here.

2229
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:49,890
So what it is,
is like,

2230
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,740
so the,
the first one is clearly he's,

2231
01:40:52,741 --> 01:40:53,574
you know,
in a studio and they're working on 

2232
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:58,090
things and just trying to understand how
all this stuff works.

2233
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:59,103
And the second one,
they took the exact same photo and just 

2234
01:41:00,341 --> 01:41:04,100
reversed it and blacked out the 
background and they put.

2235
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:06,700
This just doesn't mean that they didn't 
go to the moon.

2236
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:07,713
That just means that someone got ahold 
of some photographs and faked it and 

2237
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:16,980
it's way more likely that there was more
of that going on then that people didn't

2238
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:18,760
actually go to the moon.
Right?

2239
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:21,243
Yeah.
Yeah.

2240
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:22,173
The thing about going to the moon that's
really interesting is if they can go 

2241
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,450
again and they do go again and they find
all that stuff there,

2242
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:32,440
you know,
then everybody has to just go,

2243
01:41:32,441 --> 01:41:34,090
oh yeah,
I guess we were all this stuff is.

2244
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:34,993
I mean there's,
there's instruments on there that we 

2245
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:39,730
still monitor that the Apollo astronauts
left there.

2246
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,590
Well then we monitor,
we monitor,

2247
01:41:41,591 --> 01:41:43,480
we shoot a laser up there and bounces 
off.

2248
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,201
Yeah.
But you know,

2249
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:46,360
a laser will also bounce off the surface
of the moon.

2250
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:47,563
Yeah.
But I don't think like they're not as 

2251
01:41:48,341 --> 01:41:49,150
precise.
Right,

2252
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,900
right.
Yeah.

2253
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:52,210
But the Russians did that too with the 
lunker hood.

2254
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,073
One and two.
I believe they left a solar roof or 

2255
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,633
laser reflectors up there as well with 
the unmanned Mr Japan has a video 

2256
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:01,930
footage as far as of like last week.
Yeah.

2257
01:42:01,931 --> 01:42:04,140
First out of the dark side of the.
So that's all fake too.

2258
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,900
They will spaces fake dude.
There's no space.

2259
01:42:07,901 --> 01:42:09,040
Of course.
The moon's not even.

2260
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:10,420
What is the moon?
If space is fake,

2261
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:13,380
how did they explain that?
The images.

2262
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:14,253
What's interesting is the images of the 
dark side of the moon look exactly like 

2263
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:17,763
even like the landing and the whole 
setup looks very similar to the Apollo 

2264
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:22,504
missions.

2265
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:23,433
So they would have to either be in 
cahoots or have worked together with 

2266
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:28,030
NASA.
Sound Studio?

2267
01:42:28,031 --> 01:42:30,430
Yeah.
To figure that he the old stuff.

2268
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,121
Yeah,
look at it.

2269
01:42:31,121 --> 01:42:32,710
I mean this is the footage.
I mean,

2270
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:33,544
God damn,
that looks eerily similar to what you 

2271
01:42:36,611 --> 01:42:39,940
saw when the Apollo astronauts were 
there.

2272
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:43,630
I think it is entirely possible that 
some of the,

2273
01:42:43,710 --> 01:42:44,543
um,
some of the practice film footage of 

2274
01:42:47,441 --> 01:42:48,340
them,
you know,

2275
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:49,263
on the surface or doing things turned 
out to be pushed out as actual footage 

2276
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,043
of moon landings.
I think there was no television back 

2277
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:01,270
then.
There was no internet,

2278
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,313
there was no vcrs,
there was no ability to review things 

2279
01:43:05,111 --> 01:43:05,944
and watched them over again.
They projected something on television 

2280
01:43:08,321 --> 01:43:09,154
one time and that was it.
So when they released pressed releases 

2281
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:14,434
and videos,
it's entirely possible that some of 

2282
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:19,000
those videos that got through were 
actually just tests.

2283
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:20,223
It's entirely possible that there was 
just like the Michael Collins photos 

2284
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:23,763
that there was some fuckery going on.
You're dealing with so many human 

2285
01:43:25,811 --> 01:43:27,010
beings,
you're dealing with.

2286
01:43:27,011 --> 01:43:27,844
So many people see an estimated 530 
million people watch Armstrong's 

2287
01:43:31,961 --> 01:43:33,970
televised image and heard his voice 
describe.

2288
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:35,330
Okay.
What does that.

2289
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:37,630
It was broadcasted live like six hours 
that day.

2290
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:38,470
Yes.
Yeah.

2291
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:42,310
It was actually broadcasted live on a 
projection screen.

2292
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,370
What they did was they didn't get a 
straight feed.

2293
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:49,720
They were filming the footage that was 
on a projection screen.

2294
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,980
That's how they did it and there's some 
wonky

2295
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,813
shit that looks like they fall down and 
then they get pulled back up by wires 

2296
01:43:55,881 --> 01:43:58,100
when they're on the surface of the moon,
but again,

2297
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:01,190
I think how much of that is.
How much,

2298
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,053
how much of that is actual footage of 
them being on the moon and how much of 

2299
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:06,290
that is just test footage?
I mean,

2300
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,180
I don't know.
I don't know.

2301
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,250
Um,
I'm not sure about that,

2302
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:12,210
but I think also,
uh,

2303
01:44:12,211 --> 01:44:14,450
I don't know Jack Shit about space 
travel.

2304
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,640
I don't know anything about 
astrophysics.

2305
01:44:16,641 --> 01:44:17,474
I don't know anything about like what it
takes to land on the moon and come back 

2306
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:22,124
and whether or not.
And most of the people that talk about 

2307
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:27,600
this don't know that mythbusters did a 
nice episode on did you know,

2308
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,453
did we fake going to the moon?
And they showed a bunch of little 

2309
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:31,220
things.
For example,

2310
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:32,593
on the moon with its gravity when you,
he goes something like that into the 

2311
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:36,740
dust,
you know,

2312
01:44:36,741 --> 01:44:37,574
the particles come up and they arch back
down in a certain way that it would be 

2313
01:44:39,861 --> 01:44:42,560
different than if you are on earth so 
that gravity is different.

2314
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,630
Causes the dust to settle a different 
way.

2315
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:48,320
There was a bunch of things like that 
that proves we were there.

2316
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,380
Well,
it certainly proved that what took place

2317
01:44:51,381 --> 01:44:53,500
took place in a vacuum.
Yet,

2318
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,810
not yet,
and a gravitational pull the same as the

2319
01:44:56,811 --> 01:44:58,190
moon.
The only,

2320
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,033
um,
you've probably seen the feather in the 

2321
01:44:59,721 --> 01:45:01,430
hammered drunk yet,
but you know,

2322
01:45:01,431 --> 01:45:02,720
you can do that here.
Well,

2323
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,510
a yes in a vacuum.
Yes,

2324
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:06,340
that's right.
Yeah.

2325
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:06,890
But,
uh,

2326
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:10,160
but even a feather in a hammer,
even if it's,

2327
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:12,200
it depends upon what kind of feather it 
is,

2328
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:13,603
but a feather and a hammer,
even if you just held them here and 

2329
01:45:16,131 --> 01:45:16,964
dropped him on the ground,
they probably would landed a very 

2330
01:45:18,321 --> 01:45:19,990
similar pace.
Favorite.

2331
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:22,910
There's a spoof video about that.
We never went to the moon,

2332
01:45:22,911 --> 01:45:23,744
but couple of British comedians that,
that Kubrick thing is that with the 

2333
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:29,090
Kubrick one,
no appeal.

2334
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:29,920
Uh,
what's their name?

2335
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,940
I forget key and Peele key and Peele.
Yeah.

2336
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:32,990
So the,
the,

2337
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:34,490
the three of them are talking and you 
know,

2338
01:45:34,491 --> 01:45:35,910
okay,
we're going to fake this whole thing.

2339
01:45:35,911 --> 01:45:36,930
And,
and,

2340
01:45:36,931 --> 01:45:38,390
uh,
and then the troubleshooters,

2341
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:39,350
she's like,
well,

2342
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:40,700
I'm now,
you know,

2343
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:43,130
people are going to ask,
well how did we go to the moon?

2344
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,750
And we're going to have to,
you know,

2345
01:45:44,751 --> 01:45:46,550
build a big rocket.
So we can say,

2346
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:48,500
well we went into that big rocket and 
they're like,

2347
01:45:48,501 --> 01:45:50,330
well how much would it cost to build 
that big rocket?

2348
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:51,770
Well,
it would be really expensive.

2349
01:45:51,771 --> 01:45:54,710
I mean we might as well just go to the 
moon and then they started talking about

2350
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:55,544
the expenses,
but we only have to feed three of them 

2351
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:57,434
if we go to the moon.
But if we shoot it as a shoot here in 

2352
01:45:59,301 --> 01:46:00,134
the studio,
we're gonna have to have catering for 

2353
01:46:01,131 --> 01:46:02,660
everybody to be super expensive.

2354
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,400
It kind of goes on like that.
It's very funny.

2355
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:07,190
That is funny.
But the conspiracy theorists would say,

2356
01:46:07,191 --> 01:46:10,780
well they couldn't send someone to the 
moon so they had to fake it.

2357
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:12,340
That's why they haven't been back.
Right.

2358
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,490
They went from 1969 to 1973.
Is that what it was?

2359
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:20,120
Six successful missions,
seven attempts.

2360
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,400
Apollo 13 being the one that didn't make
it.

2361
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,830
It's a,
it's a fun theory.

2362
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,920
And what happened with me is I got way 
better at spotting bullshit and learning

2363
01:46:30,591 --> 01:46:34,490
critical thinking skills and then paying
attention to all sides.

2364
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:35,700
And I mean the,
the,

2365
01:46:35,701 --> 01:46:36,534
the real issue with something like that 
is if someone could prove definitively 

2366
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:43,423
beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only
is it impossible that no one ever went 

2367
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:49,320
to the moon,
absolutely prove it.

2368
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:50,940
That would be giant.
Yep.

2369
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:53,010
I mean really would be.
I mean,

2370
01:46:53,011 --> 01:46:55,080
it would be a huge story,
but Ken,

2371
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:56,730
is it even possible to do that?

2372
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:57,803
You know,
the other analogy I use with the Wiki 

2373
01:47:00,471 --> 01:47:03,390
leaks is there of all those tens of 
thousand,

2374
01:47:03,391 --> 01:47:04,224
hundreds of thousands of memos and 
papers and letters and government 

2375
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:08,700
documents.
There's not one mention anywhere of nine

2376
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:10,260
slash 11 was an inside job,
you know,

2377
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,453
and we had to allocate these funds to go
to this construction company who was 

2378
01:47:14,431 --> 01:47:17,090
then seen working at the World Trade 
Center.

2379
01:47:17,091 --> 01:47:19,410
But nothing like that.
So that in this case,

2380
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:23,490
the absence of evidence is evidence of 
absence didn't happen.

2381
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:24,773
Not an inside job.
And the sign 11 one and something like 

2382
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,730
that would be true for the moon landing.
I mean,

2383
01:47:29,731 --> 01:47:30,564
all those people that worked on that,
not one of them saw anything and wanted 

2384
01:47:33,511 --> 01:47:34,344
to write a book on 60 minutes.
The idea would be that there was 

2385
01:47:37,141 --> 01:47:37,974
compartmentalized and that everyone,
like say if you're working on theo 

2386
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:42,450
rings,
you don't have access to the people that

2387
01:47:42,451 --> 01:47:43,620
are working on the thrusters.

2388
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:45,900
If you have access to this,
you don't have access to that.

2389
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,093
And that there was only a very small 
group of people that controlled 

2390
01:47:49,741 --> 01:47:51,480
everything.
Also 19,

2391
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:55,140
69 was a very different environment in 
terms of like what you get away with and

2392
01:47:55,141 --> 01:47:57,270
not get away with what you could say.
It's just,

2393
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:58,403
it was really fun.
It was really fun to believe that they 

2394
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:03,150
fake going into the bone and I spent an 
inordinate amount of time,

2395
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:04,650
uh,
looking at it,

2396
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:07,080
but I completely dropped it.
I dropped it after.

2397
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:07,914
I just,
I paid attention to what I actually 

2398
01:48:10,381 --> 01:48:11,700
know.
So,

2399
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:15,980
but now you can kind of empathize with 
those who do believe theories because.

2400
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,180
Oh yeah,
but you want to hear a dumber one?

2401
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:19,140
Yeah.
Here's a dumber one.

2402
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:21,510
For the longest time,
like months,

2403
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:26,490
I believed in a thing called rods.
Do you know the tiny little insects?

2404
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:30,330
Yes.
Well they would it this guy put out this

2405
01:48:30,331 --> 01:48:31,164
duck is documentary that there was these
things flying so fast we couldn't see 

2406
01:48:35,311 --> 01:48:38,930
them with the naked eye and that they 
were like jellyfish,

2407
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:43,940
like creatures that lived amongst us and
they had all this video footage of the.

2408
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:45,960
Especially these people that were 
jumping.

2409
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,313
There were sky diving into this enormous
cave in Mexico and has there been sky 

2410
01:48:51,771 --> 01:48:52,604
diving into this cave.
You see those things flying back and 

2411
01:48:54,151 --> 01:48:56,610
forth and I was hook,
line and sinker.

2412
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:57,930
I was like,
oh my God,

2413
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:58,764
these things are around us all the time.
I was going outside and looking up 

2414
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:01,794
trying to spot them like imagine this,
these beings that are flying so fast so 

2415
01:49:05,301 --> 01:49:06,630
we can't.
We can't see them.

2416
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:07,733
The only way you capture it was on 
camera and then a show called monster 

2417
01:49:10,561 --> 01:49:12,350
quest cracked the riddle,
right?

2418
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,553
They show that it's an a video artifact 
and then if you have really high speed 

2419
01:49:16,501 --> 01:49:18,180
camera,
you just see the insect,

2420
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,410
but if you have low speed standard 
definition video cameras,

2421
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:26,880
it creates this artifact as these things
pass by very close to the lens at a high

2422
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:27,714
rate of speed,
it elongates their video signal and it 

2423
01:49:30,271 --> 01:49:33,540
makes them look like,
like this jellyfish type thing,

2424
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,520
but it's really just a video artifact.
Yeah.

2425
01:49:36,521 --> 01:49:38,100
Again,
it's a good example of anomalies.

2426
01:49:38,101 --> 01:49:40,320
You know,
here's this weird video anomaly.

2427
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,600
What is it about?
Just say,

2428
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:43,591
I don't know.
Well,

2429
01:49:43,591 --> 01:49:47,250
if you don't know anything about video,
it's way easier.

2430
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,010
Say,
oh,

2431
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,400
that's the capture,
right?

2432
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,000
Yeah.
You know,

2433
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,370
take a camera,
put it outside.

2434
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:53,330
You will capture these things.
Amazing,

2435
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:54,750
right?
Yeah,

2436
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,733
that's right.
The other aspect of conspiracy theories 

2437
01:49:58,051 --> 01:50:01,500
is cognitive dissonance.
That is we want the size of the event to

2438
01:50:01,501 --> 01:50:05,370
be matched by a cause that's equally 
have that size.

2439
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:08,580
So the analogy I use is you know the 
Holocaust,

2440
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:12,360
the worst genocide and human history 
caused by the Nazis,

2441
01:50:12,361 --> 01:50:15,090
the worst bridge iem political regime 
and human history.

2442
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,850
There's a match there,
but if you say something like,

2443
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:18,510
uh,
you know,

2444
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:19,343
jfk,
the leader of the free world brought 

2445
01:50:20,851 --> 01:50:23,040
down by who?
He Harvey Oswald.

2446
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,210
Just some nobody,
you know,

2447
01:50:24,211 --> 01:50:25,044
there's this mismatch or nine slash 11 
is huge thing by 19 guys with box 

2448
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:29,340
cutters.
Do you think that.

2449
01:50:29,341 --> 01:50:30,980
Doesn't Harvey Oswald acted alone?
Yeah.

2450
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:32,633
What makes you think that?
All of the evidence and not none of the 

2451
01:50:34,891 --> 01:50:38,730
evidence against anybody else and all of
the evidence against particularly him,

2452
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:43,810
the general posner's book case closed.
And then the attorney.

2453
01:50:43,831 --> 01:50:45,150
What's his name?
That was the,

2454
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:45,993
uh,

2455
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:47,483
attorney

2456
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:49,390
he,
his name.

2457
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:54,330
He has a massive book where he lines up 
every single one of the arguments by the

2458
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:55,393
JFK conspiracy for example,
because just make a big deal about how 

2459
01:50:58,730 --> 01:51:01,760
Oswaldo got a job at the book depository
building,

2460
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:02,653
which just happened to be where the 
parade just happened to be where the 

2461
01:51:05,211 --> 01:51:07,580
parade route was going.
So you get to have a clear shot.

2462
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:08,833
So it was positive that track down when 
the White House determined even when 

2463
01:51:12,201 --> 01:51:13,034
Kennedy was going to Dallas,
let alone what the parade route would 

2464
01:51:14,871 --> 01:51:17,180
be.
An oswell already had the job there.

2465
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:20,840
That's just chance.
So he knew it advanced bro.

2466
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,480
He knew that you needed,
or do you think it's possible?

2467
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,070
Well,
that Oswald was in cahoots?

2468
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:27,480
No,
no,

2469
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:28,920
no.
Why do you think that?

2470
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:30,570
What about the magic bullet theory?

2471
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:33,910
Well,
that's been settled by the fact that the

2472
01:51:33,911 --> 01:51:34,744
way it showed in the videos is that the 
two seats are like this and at the 

2473
01:51:37,781 --> 01:51:39,070
bullet has to do this.
Well.

2474
01:51:39,071 --> 01:51:42,120
In fact the seats were like that and 
that connolly was.

2475
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,113
You're explaining this.
I'm in audio form just when you're 

2476
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:45,911
saying.
Oh yeah,

2477
01:51:45,911 --> 01:51:48,650
so it's like stadium seating.
One's elevated above the other.

2478
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:49,200
That's right.
Yeah.

2479
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,033
So the bullet actually,
when it passes through the neck through 

2480
01:51:52,771 --> 01:51:56,080
Kennedy's neck and then hits Connolly's 
shoulder it,

2481
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:57,460
it is already moving.

2482
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:59,700
We get to his wrist at fraction is 
roasted,

2483
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:01,120
right?
The.

2484
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,280
This has been tested and tested and 
tested.

2485
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:04,203
Well,
sort of.

2486
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:05,590
Here's,
here's my issue with it.

2487
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:07,470
There's a couple issues.
One on the,

2488
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:08,463
on the pro side,
the idea that bullets we'll take a 

2489
01:52:10,721 --> 01:52:12,740
straight path is ridiculous.
I've,

2490
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:13,643
I've,
I've talked to hunters that have shot 

2491
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:20,280
animals in the front and had a bullet 
come out the same side.

2492
01:52:20,321 --> 01:52:21,154
They shot it and it ricocheted off bones
and came out like the front of the 

2493
01:52:23,981 --> 01:52:24,814
animal,
like bullets take weird paths when they 

2494
01:52:26,981 --> 01:52:28,600
hit things in particular.
Uh,

2495
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:33,630
so to arrows they take as a person who's
well versed in firearms and shot animals

2496
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:38,590
and hunted this.
You don't.

2497
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:39,963
Sometimes the bullet goes straight 
through and sometimes it hits bones and 

2498
01:52:42,851 --> 01:52:44,860
wacky things happen.
Things deflect.

2499
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,560
But on the negative side they always 
distort.

2500
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,290
Bullets always distort,
particularly when they hit bone,

2501
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:55,700
but bothered me was that they found that
bullet in Connolly's Gurney.

2502
01:52:56,330 --> 01:52:57,163
When they brought him to the hospital,
they just conveniently found this 

2503
01:52:59,301 --> 01:53:00,050
bullet.
Aha,

2504
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:02,660
we have it.
This is the bullet that matches the same

2505
01:53:02,661 --> 01:53:06,170
rifle and but it wasn't pristine.
It was flattened.

2506
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,870
Barely.
If you look at that bullet,

2507
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:11,810
that bullet does nothing like a bullet 
that hit bone.

2508
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:14,060
When bullets hit bone,
they mushroom,

2509
01:53:14,061 --> 01:53:15,290
they balloon,
they bend,

2510
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:17,930
they distort wildly.
They don't come out looking like that.

2511
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,913
They come out looking like that when you
shoot them into water or when you shoot 

2512
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:21,974
them into like feathers,
they don't come out looking like that 

2513
01:53:24,651 --> 01:53:25,484
under normal circumstances when they 
shattered the bone of two different 

2514
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:29,990
people.
Well to you know that for sure.

2515
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:31,340
No,
I do not know that for sure.

2516
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,233
But um,
one thing I do know a lot about is I 

2517
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:38,750
know quite a bit about what bullets look
like when they hit things.

2518
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:39,583
I've looked into this pretty extensively
and I've talked to a lot of people in 

2519
01:53:42,111 --> 01:53:44,900
law enforcement,
military hunters,

2520
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:48,440
and none of them believed that that 
bullet hit bones,

2521
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:50,420
shattered.
Bones came out looking like that.

2522
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,433
Is it possible that that bullet was the 
only bullet ever in the history of the 

2523
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:55,450
world that did do that?
Yeah,

2524
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:57,280
it might be.
Okay.

2525
01:53:57,290 --> 01:54:00,560
So we're getting kind of caught up in 
the weeds of the anomalies.

2526
01:54:00,561 --> 01:54:01,670
What about this?
Just a bullet.

2527
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:03,463
Oswald himself had attempted to 
assassinate a general name Walker six 

2528
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:11,960
months before with his rifle and a 
handgun and he went over to the house.

2529
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:14,810
He took a shot through the guys when he 
saw him at the desk,

2530
01:54:14,811 --> 01:54:15,830
took a shot,
missed him.

2531
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,670
He told his wife about it.
I'm a revolutionary.

2532
01:54:19,671 --> 01:54:21,650
I'm trying to start stuff.
Don't get me wrong.

2533
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,420
I'm not saying that Oswald was innocent.

2534
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:24,830
I'm not.
I mean,

2535
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,520
I think it's very possible that Oswald 
did shoot at the president.

2536
01:54:28,521 --> 01:54:29,354
He might've even hit the president.
It's very possibly that some other 

2537
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:33,800
people were involved as well,
who,

2538
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:35,420
I don't know.
Say this is the problem,

2539
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:36,463
but wait a minute,
why is it a problem if you don't know 

2540
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,350
who they are?
Just because you don't know who they are

2541
01:54:39,351 --> 01:54:40,184
doesn't mean it didn't exist,
but why do we need to postulate extra 

2542
01:54:42,891 --> 01:54:43,724
people?
Because of all the gunshots that 

2543
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:45,524
happened in a short amount of time.
The fact that the reason why they came 

2544
01:54:47,661 --> 01:54:50,090
up with the theory of the magic bullet 
in the first place,

2545
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:54,140
because they had to account for a bullet
that hit a curb underneath the overpass.

2546
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,040
Do you know that?
Right?

2547
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:55,611
Yeah.
Okay.

2548
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:57,270
There's three.
There's okay.

2549
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:59,590
If you know why they came out with them.
I.

2550
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:00,380
Yeah,
I've been there.

2551
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:01,970
Do you know why they came up with,
but it's short.

2552
01:55:01,971 --> 01:55:02,840
I mean,
it's right there.

2553
01:55:02,841 --> 01:55:06,890
You could not miss the point was that,
that's sort of true.

2554
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:08,420
Yeah.
It's not a far shot.

2555
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:11,150
And he was a pretty good marksman.
A positive track down is.

2556
01:55:11,151 --> 01:55:11,984
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about the reason why they 

2557
01:55:13,311 --> 01:55:15,260
came up with the magic bullet theory in 
the first place.

2558
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,190
Do you know what?
Well,

2559
01:55:16,191 --> 01:55:17,610
I thought it was because,
uh,

2560
01:55:17,611 --> 01:55:19,850
of the alignment of the seats.
No,

2561
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:23,030
because they had to attribute three 
shots.

2562
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:25,770
They had to figure out in one of them 
they were,

2563
01:55:25,771 --> 01:55:26,601
they were thinking,
well,

2564
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:28,580
they all have these wounds.
Came from three bullets,

2565
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:29,653
but then they found a bullet that had 
hit the curb on the underside and got 

2566
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:34,280
checked into a hospital because he was 
hitting the ricochet.

2567
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:38,720
So there's a curb that they proved was 
hit with a bullet.

2568
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:39,583
There was a bullet hole in the granite 
or whatever the fuck the curbs made out 

2569
01:55:42,231 --> 01:55:43,830
of it.
Hit this guy.

2570
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,950
He went to the hospital.
So he was hit with a ricochet.

2571
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:51,330
So they knew that one bullet had not hit
the president,

2572
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:55,410
and so they had to attribute all of 
these wounds to one bullet.

2573
01:55:55,411 --> 01:55:57,780
Now they had one bullet that landed into
his neck,

2574
01:55:57,990 --> 01:55:58,823
another bullet that hit him in the head.
So how do these three bullets cause a 

2575
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:05,540
wound timely as well.
Then they came up with the map.

2576
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,620
There's,
there's the bullet look at that bullet,

2577
01:56:07,621 --> 01:56:10,110
but you have to look at this at the end.
It's flattened.

2578
01:56:10,111 --> 01:56:12,090
If you look at it from the end.
No,

2579
01:56:12,091 --> 01:56:12,924
it's not.
Look at this.

2580
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:13,973
Under no circumstances do I feel that 
this bullet could hit a risks and still 

2581
01:56:16,531 --> 01:56:19,230
not be deformed.
We proved that by experiments as a chief

2582
01:56:19,231 --> 01:56:20,064
consultant in wound ballistics for the 
US army who supervised tests for the 

2583
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:24,960
Warren Commission.
Here's the thing,

2584
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:26,093
I don't.

2585
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:31,190
I don't necessarily think that there was
some grand conspiracy,

2586
01:56:31,291 --> 01:56:35,520
but I do think it's entirely possible 
that someone took that posthumously,

2587
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:39,630
took that rifle and wanting to pin it on
Lee Harvey Oswald definitively.

2588
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:40,733
Look,
there's people that do things when they 

2589
01:56:41,341 --> 01:56:43,530
know someone's guilty and they plant 
evidence.

2590
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:46,810
Mark Furhman did that with Oj Simpson.
They found his glove and they,

2591
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:47,663
they planted evidence and there was one 
of the reasons why Oj got off because 

2592
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:54,270
there was some sort of conspiring to 
make it look like he was,

2593
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:55,230
you know,
it was the.

2594
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:56,083
The evidence was a clear path.
They could have just taken that rifle 

2595
01:56:58,741 --> 01:57:01,770
and look,
could've been that Oswald did it alone.

2596
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:03,770
It's possible,
but also could have been this.

2597
01:57:03,771 --> 01:57:05,340
Some other people were shooting at them 
too.

2598
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,473
It could have been that they had decided
to have oswald be a part of this and 

2599
01:57:09,331 --> 01:57:13,110
when Jack Ruby ran in and shot them,
that doesn't look a little suspicious at

2600
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:13,944
some guy with ties to the mob gets right
up to this guy who just shot the 

2601
01:57:16,771 --> 01:57:18,900
president and shoots him like why?

2602
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,450
That's never shot before.
Do it publicly.

2603
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:24,720
Posner talks about Ruby's character and 
who he was,

2604
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:28,710
major kennedy supporter,
a running with some bad dudes,

2605
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:32,700
some bread bad andres there in Texas and
he was a gun owner.

2606
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:35,550
A security wasn't anything like it is 
now.

2607
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,580
He really could just walk right in like 
he did.

2608
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:39,443
It's possible,
but it's also possible that that guy 

2609
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:44,350
owed something to the mob and this is 
what they told them to do.

2610
01:57:44,351 --> 01:57:46,050
Are you going to get rid of that guy?
No one's going to care.

2611
01:57:46,051 --> 01:57:47,010
They're going to be happy.
Fuck,

2612
01:57:47,011 --> 01:57:52,011
that guy just shot the president who 
seems so it seems like people want it to

2613
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:54,924
be one way or the other and they want,
they want this case closed and be that 

2614
01:57:59,401 --> 01:57:59,731
way.
I mean,

2615
01:57:59,731 --> 01:58:00,564
Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy
and that was evident pretty quickly 

2616
01:58:03,211 --> 01:58:05,250
afterwards and they rounded them up.

2617
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:06,390
Uh,
you know,

2618
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:07,223
World War One was launched by a 
conspiracy with the assassination of 

2619
01:58:09,481 --> 01:58:13,060
Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian group of,
called the black hand,

2620
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:13,913
the group of nationalists while we were 
talking about the Vietnam War to the 

2621
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:18,690
Gulf of Tonkin incident.
False flag.

2622
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:21,090
So these things do happen.
They're all false legs.

2623
01:58:21,091 --> 01:58:23,340
There are conspiracies to assassinate 
foreign leaders.

2624
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:24,850
Uh,
you know,

2625
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:25,651
hits,
wrote this book.

2626
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:28,770
I'm Kissinger as a war criminal,
uh,

2627
01:58:28,771 --> 01:58:29,221
that,
you know,

2628
01:58:29,221 --> 01:58:30,054
all the shenanigans.
We were doing it in South America with 

2629
01:58:32,011 --> 01:58:34,050
dictators.
There were back in this take Taylor,

2630
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:34,913
because he's the son of a bitch,
but he's our son of a bitch versus this 

2631
01:58:36,691 --> 01:58:41,691
guy and we're going to sas and a Castro.
All the stuff that came out that Johnson

2632
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,993
tried to cover up that came out in the 
Pentagon papers about Kennedy plotting 

2633
01:58:47,831 --> 01:58:52,150
to have Castro assassinated.
That's a kind of conspiracies that this.

2634
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,400
Absolutely this does happen.
The question is,

2635
01:58:54,401 --> 01:58:58,840
did it happen in that particular case or
this one or a year and the evidence,

2636
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:03,010
in my opinion,
after reading particularly Gerald Posner

2637
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:05,950
is booked a case closed.
It's funny.

2638
01:59:05,951 --> 01:59:08,690
Internet meme that went around last week
of a guy who dies,

2639
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:09,573
goes to heaven and God says you,
you've been such a good fellow your 

2640
01:59:12,131 --> 01:59:13,940
whole life.
I'll grant you one wish.

2641
01:59:13,941 --> 01:59:15,340
She can ask me anything.
He said,

2642
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:16,480
alright,
who killed Kennedy?

2643
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:17,923
And God said it was Lee Harvey Oswald,
acting alone using his own Kokona rifle 

2644
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,220
and the guy goes,
this goes higher up than I thought.

2645
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:28,820
That's funny,
man.

2646
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:32,700
Did you ever read David Lifton's novel 
or a book about it rather?

2647
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,640
Yeah.
Best evidence.

2648
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:35,360
Best evidence.

2649
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:36,193
So I didn't read the whole book when I 
was researching this back in the 

2650
01:59:39,531 --> 01:59:43,460
nineties when after the Oliver Stone 
film came out,

2651
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:45,320
because after that,
when that came out,

2652
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:45,891
I thought,
man,

2653
01:59:45,891 --> 01:59:48,020
if only half of this or 10 percent of 
this is true,

2654
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:51,620
it's definitely a conspiracy.
But then there are websites dedicated to

2655
01:59:51,621 --> 01:59:53,050
everything he got wrong there.

2656
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:54,273
Well,
he made people up like the General 

2657
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,310
Donald Sutherland character.
That guy doesn't even exist.

2658
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:02,660
He just used him as a theatrical tool,
very distorting film.

2659
02:00:02,661 --> 02:00:06,500
And that film is such a powerful medium.
It's hard to overcome that.

2660
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:07,760
Well,
that movie in particular,

2661
02:00:07,770 --> 02:00:09,800
you've got Kevin Costner,
who's the good guy.

2662
02:00:09,801 --> 02:00:12,120
Everybody loves it.
Yeah.

2663
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:15,650
I mean that is a Jack Lemmon,
Walter Matthau too.

2664
02:00:15,651 --> 02:00:16,484
Crazy movie.
And it really has you believing that 

2665
02:00:18,441 --> 02:00:21,740
there's some sort of a continuous into 
the lip back into the left people.

2666
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:23,750
Well,
here's the thing about that though.

2667
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:25,730
Well,
I've looked at that over and over again.

2668
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,833
Yes it is back into the left,
but the spray kind of comes out the 

2669
02:00:31,041 --> 02:00:31,850
front.
Yeah,

2670
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:32,620
it is.
Yeah.

2671
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,190
Yeah.
It kinda comes out the front.

2672
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:35,083
And one thing that does happen when 
people or things get shot is you have 

2673
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:43,850
nerves and nerves react and things.
Things do weird,

2674
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:48,230
weird results in your body when if you 
get hit by something,

2675
02:00:48,231 --> 02:00:51,890
it doesn't get his hands come up like 
that.

2676
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:53,330
Well,
he's grabbing his neck.

2677
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,430
Apparently.
That was the other thing was there was a

2678
02:00:55,431 --> 02:00:57,560
difference in the autopsy results from 
Bethesda,

2679
02:00:57,561 --> 02:00:59,180
Maryland versus in Dallas,
Texas,

2680
02:00:59,181 --> 02:01:00,014
Dallas,
Texas.

2681
02:01:00,590 --> 02:01:05,590
They attributed the throat,
wound to a frontal shot at something.

2682
02:01:06,081 --> 02:01:08,690
Hit him in the front.
And then the Bethesda,

2683
02:01:08,691 --> 02:01:11,240
Maryland,
they said that it was a trait wound.

2684
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:12,410
They,
uh,

2685
02:01:12,410 --> 02:01:14,640
they opened them up to clear his 
breathing pathway.

2686
02:01:14,641 --> 02:01:16,400
And then the conspiracy theorists will 
say,

2687
02:01:16,401 --> 02:01:17,234
why would you clear the breathing 
pathway of a guy who doesn't have a 

2688
02:01:18,741 --> 02:01:20,750
brain spraying was shot out of his head.

2689
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:25,310
I just don't like when people say they 
know one way or another,

2690
02:01:25,650 --> 02:01:27,800
we harvey Oswald acted alone.
Fuck.

2691
02:01:27,801 --> 02:01:29,650
Could you know,
there was a bunch of bull.

2692
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:30,553
There was also bullet fragments and 
Connolly's wrist that weren't missing 

2693
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:35,660
from the bullet itself.
The bullet itself,

2694
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:38,460
whether you think it's pristine or not,
it's still,

2695
02:01:38,461 --> 02:01:39,294
it's not missing a lot of fragments and 
there's fragments in Connolly's body 

2696
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,680
that they.
You could detect an x ray,

2697
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:47,740
there's x rays in his wrist and you 
could see the little pieces of the.

2698
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:49,500
I don't know what the explanation for 
that.

2699
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:51,950
The fact that,
I don't know.

2700
02:01:51,951 --> 02:01:53,450
I'm not the world's expert on this 
stuff.

2701
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:55,790
People want to clean it up.
That's what I don't like.

2702
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:56,653
They want to clean it up or they want to
muddy it up instead of like looking at 

2703
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:02,150
it a hundred percent objectively,
they want one thing or another.

2704
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:05,210
I think it's entirely possible that Lee 
Harvey Oswald,

2705
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:08,390
it's either to me they want to say,
this is the.

2706
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:11,360
These are the two narratives.
Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy.

2707
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:14,690
He had nothing to do with the government
set him up or he acted alone,

2708
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:17,390
but why?
Why couldn't he have been evolved in it?

2709
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:18,493
You know,
he obviously was involved in some shady 

2710
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:22,730
characters.
The guy spent a ton of time in Russia,

2711
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,270
came back over here very easily.
Even though the Cold War was going on.

2712
02:02:26,271 --> 02:02:27,104
There's a lot of weird stuff.
He might've very well been some sort of 

2713
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:30,374
a government informant or working in 
cahoots with the government if that's 

2714
02:02:33,891 --> 02:02:34,724
the case,
and he did shoot candidate or shoot at 

2715
02:02:36,861 --> 02:02:37,694
Kennedy,
who's to say that he wasn't with other 

2716
02:02:39,291 --> 02:02:40,124
people and they killed him because this 
guy was going to go to jail and he was 

2717
02:02:42,681 --> 02:02:44,810
going to start talking.
When they arrested him,

2718
02:02:44,811 --> 02:02:46,040
he said,
I'm a Patsy,

2719
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:48,200
patsy and then blam.

2720
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,060
He's dead up.
We got them and that's it.

2721
02:02:50,061 --> 02:02:50,894
Wrap it up tight.
It wasn't until the Zapruder film that 

2722
02:02:52,371 --> 02:02:55,580
people really started to question and I 
think that was.

2723
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:58,390
It might've been 10 years later.
Right.

2724
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,750
We've talked about,
you know,

2725
02:02:59,751 --> 02:03:02,210
the whole history of the Zapruder film,
how it was released.

2726
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:04,810
The Geraldo Rivera show,
right.

2727
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:05,990
Crazy,
right.

2728
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:06,913
Dick Gregory comedian brought the film 
footage to the Geraldo Rivera show and 

2729
02:03:12,111 --> 02:03:14,300
showed it on television for the First 
Time magazine,

2730
02:03:14,301 --> 02:03:17,510
but the rights to life magazine had the 
rights and didn't do anything with it.

2731
02:03:17,511 --> 02:03:18,344
They kept it for more than a decade.
Dick Gregory got ahold of the actual 

2732
02:03:22,191 --> 02:03:23,024
film footage and premiered it on the 
Geraldo Rivera shall I want to say it 

2733
02:03:27,471 --> 02:03:31,610
was like 1971 or 72 or something like 
that,

2734
02:03:31,611 --> 02:03:32,444
so it was way,
way after the assassination that the 

2735
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:35,960
American,
what was it?

2736
02:03:35,961 --> 02:03:38,150
Seventy five is 12 years old.
That's crazy.

2737
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:42,020
Seventy five,
so all those years later and then people

2738
02:03:42,021 --> 02:03:43,730
got a chance to see the footage and they
were like,

2739
02:03:43,731 --> 02:03:44,564
wow,
this is not how it was described to us 

2740
02:03:45,501 --> 02:03:47,300
at all and it made people skeptical.

2741
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:48,703
There's a good Nova show on ballistics 
in the head and testing the rifle and 

2742
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:55,040
could you shoot that many times and that
many seconds and so on,

2743
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:56,270
and it's pretty cool.
To me,

2744
02:03:56,271 --> 02:03:57,104
it's pretty convincing.
The problem with me is I know too much 

2745
02:03:59,481 --> 02:04:01,550
about what happens when bullets hit 
bones.

2746
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:03,740
I don't buy that.
That was the bullet I do.

2747
02:04:03,790 --> 02:04:04,623
Look,
I think they could've just dropped that 

2748
02:04:05,841 --> 02:04:06,674
bullet off.
It doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald 

2749
02:04:08,301 --> 02:04:10,570
didn't do it.
Thinking about that bullet though,

2750
02:04:10,571 --> 02:04:14,660
is that there might be some fuckery 
involved and the David Liftin book was.

2751
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:17,630
That was the book that got me into 
conspiracies.

2752
02:04:17,631 --> 02:04:19,510
That fucking book.
God dammit.

2753
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:20,503
If I could go back and not read it.
I bombed on stage because of that book 

2754
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:24,120
you did?
Yeah.

2755
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:24,953
Well it was my fault,
but I've read that book the day I was 

2756
02:04:28,671 --> 02:04:29,504
performing and I was freaking out 
because I was like 24 or something like 

2757
02:04:32,931 --> 02:04:33,291
that.
I was like,

2758
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:34,280
oh,
this is crazy.

2759
02:04:34,610 --> 02:04:37,500
They killed the president and I was so 
naive and

2760
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:42,630
I was like really bummed out when I went
onstage and then I realized like,

2761
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:43,220
oh,
you can't.

2762
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:44,053
Like I didn't know any better.
I've only been doing comedy for three 

2763
02:04:45,301 --> 02:04:46,134
years and you can't go on stage.
Bombed out if you've got to get your 

2764
02:04:48,301 --> 02:04:49,134
head together.
You can't just say the jokes and not 

2765
02:04:50,251 --> 02:04:54,330
have some emotional attachment to them,
but that book highlights what it was was

2766
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:58,320
lifted,
was a bookkeeper and an accountant,

2767
02:04:58,321 --> 02:04:59,154
I believe,
and he was hired to do something with 

2768
02:05:01,621 --> 02:05:06,510
the Warren Commission report and in it 
because he found some contradictions and

2769
02:05:06,511 --> 02:05:08,700
he went over the entire Warren 
Commission report,

2770
02:05:08,701 --> 02:05:11,250
which is an enormous,
enormous publication,

2771
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:12,473
and he found all of these problems,
all of these problems in the Warren 

2772
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,360
Commission report and all of these 
contradictions.

2773
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:23,070
And it was his determination after 
reading everything in writing his book,

2774
02:05:23,490 --> 02:05:26,340
he thought that the conclusion they 
made,

2775
02:05:26,341 --> 02:05:27,174
they made before the fact and that they 
wrote all this stuff to sort of Vr the 

2776
02:05:31,561 --> 02:05:32,394
backup,
their conclusion that it wasn't based 

2777
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:38,400
entirely on an objective version of the 
facts of the event itself.

2778
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:40,320
And his,
his take was,

2779
02:05:40,321 --> 02:05:42,690
there was a conspiracy.
Well,

2780
02:05:42,691 --> 02:05:45,260
it's launched a mini industry of books.
It,

2781
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:46,543
man,
think about all the money that's been 

2782
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,910
made off of the Kennedy assassination.
If you go down the rabbit hole with this

2783
02:05:50,911 --> 02:05:51,744
stuff,
do you ever see the Jesse Ventura 

2784
02:05:53,791 --> 02:05:55,430
version of it?
Uh,

2785
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:59,880
he believes that he
is the best.

2786
02:05:59,881 --> 02:06:02,370
It was on his computer spirits he show.
Yeah,

2787
02:06:02,371 --> 02:06:03,540
he's out there.
Oh yeah.

2788
02:06:03,541 --> 02:06:05,040
He believes it.
Yeah.

2789
02:06:05,041 --> 02:06:07,500
He was like,
no one could have made shocked.

2790
02:06:08,010 --> 02:06:09,300
They definitely could have made that 
shot.

2791
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:11,670
It's a rifle.
It's not that far.

2792
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:15,000
Just because someone gets lucky doesn't 
mean they can't get lucky.

2793
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:19,470
Like people get lucky all the time.
People flip a coin and it lands on heads

2794
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:20,600
a mile away.
I mean,

2795
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:22,410
you know,
you could throw a coin,

2796
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:23,363
you could,
you could throw a coin out of a 

2797
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:26,040
helicopter,
you know,

2798
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:31,290
you could say this is going to be heads 
when it lands and it can be heads.

2799
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:32,520
You can get lucky.
Right.

2800
02:06:32,521 --> 02:06:33,354
It really is possible.
Well this assassination of Franz 

2801
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:37,350
Ferdinand that triggered the first world
war.

2802
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:38,243
This.
Yes.

2803
02:06:38,450 --> 02:06:39,810
Okay.
They,

2804
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,170
they messed up.
I had like seven of them and they met in

2805
02:06:43,171 --> 02:06:45,780
secret and they got their weapons that 
morning and so on.

2806
02:06:45,781 --> 02:06:46,950
And a couple of them,
chicken,

2807
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:48,310
dad,
somebody else cut last.

2808
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:51,210
It's just like three of them there.
Somebody threw a hand grenade,

2809
02:06:51,211 --> 02:06:52,044
missed,
rolled into the car behind the friends 

2810
02:06:54,970 --> 02:06:58,260
for non and and they got hurt and went 
to the hospital and he's like,

2811
02:06:58,290 --> 02:07:00,330
oh fuck,
there's not giving my speech,

2812
02:07:00,331 --> 02:07:02,550
let's go to the hospital and visit,
see how he's doing.

2813
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:03,593
So they double back like half an hour 
later they doubled back and come back 

2814
02:07:06,541 --> 02:07:08,790
down the same route.
And the guy who had missed,

2815
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:10,440
he was just sitting there on the curb.
It's like,

2816
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:11,430
Oh fuck,
here they are.

2817
02:07:11,490 --> 02:07:12,570
Bam.
Yeah,

2818
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:14,130
pure luck.
Pure luck.

2819
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:14,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

2820
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:15,990
That doesn't happen.
Yeah.

2821
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:17,020
Yeah.
I mean that,

2822
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:19,710
that history turns more on that kind of 
thing.

2823
02:07:19,711 --> 02:07:23,720
Then on carefully orchestrated,
perfectly executed plot.

2824
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:25,230
Sure.
It certainly can.

2825
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:26,660
But you know,
the,

2826
02:07:26,661 --> 02:07:27,760
the idea that,
um,

2827
02:07:27,910 --> 02:07:28,320
uh,
I'm,

2828
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:30,090
I'm,
I've always found it offensive.

2829
02:07:30,091 --> 02:07:32,400
The idea that there's no way Oswald 
could have hit him.

2830
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:34,590
Like people say that like there's no 
way.

2831
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:36,070
There's no way you're out of your.
You never

2832
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:38,020
shot anything.
That's crazy.

2833
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,030
I can make that shot.
One hundred percent.

2834
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:41,360
Yep.
I will.

2835
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:42,213
Look,
if you have a rifle with a scope and a 

2836
02:07:44,081 --> 02:07:46,780
guy is a hundred yards away,
you tell them you can't shoot him.

2837
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:48,390
Right?
That's crazy time.

2838
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:50,670
That's crazy.
Talk or the rifle was out of La.

2839
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,543
That was the other thing.
They said the scope wasn't lined up 

2840
02:07:53,441 --> 02:07:55,030
correctly.
Here's the thing,

2841
02:07:55,031 --> 02:07:57,190
folks,
if you have a rifle,

2842
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:59,170
okay,
and this has happened to me before,

2843
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:01,930
and you drop the rifle,
the scope gets damaged,

2844
02:08:01,931 --> 02:08:04,420
it gets moved.
It's a very sensitive thing,

2845
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:08,950
like when you're talking about something
that goes faster than the speed of sound

2846
02:08:09,190 --> 02:08:10,150
of bullets,
boom,

2847
02:08:10,151 --> 02:08:12,700
firing out of a rifle,
you have that.

2848
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,593
That is going incredibly fast and to be 
able to get that radical exactly on 

2849
02:08:17,411 --> 02:08:20,410
where you think that bullet's going to 
hit requires a lot of adjustments.

2850
02:08:20,411 --> 02:08:23,020
When you go to the range,
they set up a lead sled.

2851
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:26,560
You put your rifle down on this sled so 
you're not holding the rifle,

2852
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:29,050
and by the way,
we oddball wasn't holding it either.

2853
02:08:29,051 --> 02:08:31,060
The idea was that he had it rested,
right?

2854
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:34,390
Which makes it much more steady and much
more easier to make an accurate shot.

2855
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:35,433
So you set up this rifle on the lead 
sled and it's usually 100 yards or 200 

2856
02:08:39,011 --> 02:08:39,550
yards,
whatever,

2857
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:43,270
however farther distances to the target,
you squeeze,

2858
02:08:43,271 --> 02:08:44,051
squeeze,
squeeze,

2859
02:08:44,051 --> 02:08:44,884
boom.
That trigger goes off and you see that 

2860
02:08:46,301 --> 02:08:49,300
the bullet is low and to the left by a 
couple of inches,

2861
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:52,510
you make an adjustment on the scope.
If you drop that rifle,

2862
02:08:52,511 --> 02:08:55,240
that scope gets knocked the adjustments 
out the window.

2863
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:56,403
So the idea that there's like a perfect 
chain of command between Lee Harvey 

2864
02:08:59,080 --> 02:08:59,913
Oswald,
pulling that trigger and that scope 

2865
02:09:00,611 --> 02:09:02,790
never got rattled at all.
No,

2866
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:03,633
but the conspiracy theorists want you to
think there's no way he could've made 

2867
02:09:06,881 --> 02:09:07,540
that shot.

2868
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:09,430
That scope wasn't even lined up.
Good.

2869
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:11,290
How the fuck do you know?
No.

2870
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,513
You don't know.
Like anybody who knows anything about 

2871
02:09:13,601 --> 02:09:15,460
rifles,
knows there's no way you could know,

2872
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:18,220
because if all you'd have to do is whack
it here,

2873
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:21,730
I'm going to bring you the rifle and 
just bump it with your elbow funny.

2874
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:22,713
Knock it into a wall when you're handing
it to someone and that scope's going to 

2875
02:09:24,851 --> 02:09:25,600
be off,
right?

2876
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,433
So you then you take it to a range.
We're going to prove definitively that 

2877
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:30,820
he could have never made this shot 
because this scope is off.

2878
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:33,130
Look,
it's six inches to the left.

2879
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:36,470
Wow.
Case closed right now.

2880
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:37,923
There's no way people know whether or 
not that scope was on when he was 

2881
02:09:41,711 --> 02:09:43,120
pulling that trigger.
There's no way.

2882
02:09:43,121 --> 02:09:45,280
You know,
when I went to Dealey Plaza,

2883
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:47,980
it's so big and our public imagination,
it's not.

2884
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:51,610
It's not like this is it.
It's tiny and so small.

2885
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:53,840
And then you go up to the museum and 
you're on the sixth floor,

2886
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,360
positive,
the book depository,

2887
02:09:55,361 --> 02:09:58,120
and you look down and they have an x,
the two xs in the street.

2888
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:00,790
And you think that's just right there.
Dude,

2889
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:03,160
I can shoot that with an arrow.
I bet you could.

2890
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:04,070
I can.
Yeah.

2891
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:04,953
I guarantee if you give me some time,
you give me some time if you put a 

2892
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:11,680
target right where that thing was right 
where that a lincoln was and,

2893
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:14,980
and you put me in that window,
I guarantee you I hit that target with a

2894
02:10:14,981 --> 02:10:16,030
bow,
right?

2895
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,250
Like the idea that you couldn't.
And I'm holding it.

2896
02:10:18,530 --> 02:10:19,363
No rest.
The idea that you couldn't do that with 

2897
02:10:21,291 --> 02:10:22,600
a,
with a rifle,

2898
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:24,010
right?
You turn it certainly could.

2899
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:26,170
Lee Harvey Oswald certainly could have 
done it.

2900
02:10:26,350 --> 02:10:28,780
He certainly couldn't have shot at 
Kennedy.

2901
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:29,703
He was a crazy fuck.
Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in a lot 

2902
02:10:32,021 --> 02:10:34,100
of shady shit.
It wasn't like he was just

2903
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,933
some dentists somewhere toward the 
second reading depositary he scored the 

2904
02:10:38,601 --> 02:10:40,380
second highest marksmanship.
There it is.

2905
02:10:40,381 --> 02:10:41,240
Right?
Right here to here.

2906
02:10:41,250 --> 02:10:41,740
Right.
Dude,

2907
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:44,120
that's so small.
That was such a short distance.

2908
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:45,553
Then the other question I had when 
you're coming up Houston street and 

2909
02:10:47,361 --> 02:10:48,194
going left,
I always wondered why he didn't shoot 

2910
02:10:50,421 --> 02:10:53,150
him there when the car's coming right at
him.

2911
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:54,873
What was the other window?
He was in the window on the left hand 

2912
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:57,530
side.
He was over there.

2913
02:10:57,770 --> 02:10:58,370
No,
no,

2914
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:58,830
no,
no.

2915
02:10:58,830 --> 02:11:00,740
It's over here.
Yeah,

2916
02:11:00,741 --> 02:11:01,574
it's right there.
That's where he shot them from that 

2917
02:11:02,601 --> 02:11:03,590
window there.
Yup.

2918
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:04,903
So I always wondered why he didn't shoot
him when the car was coming right at 

2919
02:11:06,891 --> 02:11:07,724
him.
Because that would have been a cleaner 

2920
02:11:08,061 --> 02:11:10,050
shot.
It seems to me head on you mean?

2921
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:10,910
Yeah.
Yeah,

2922
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:13,143
um,
maybe you want to shoot him in the back 

2923
02:11:13,791 --> 02:11:14,050
of the head.

2924
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:16,970
Does it have like a sniper?
It's maybe panic.

2925
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,270
It's that upper right?
Yeah,

2926
02:11:18,730 --> 02:11:19,580
at that one.
Yeah.

2927
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:21,381
Wow.
Yeah.

2928
02:11:21,381 --> 02:11:23,460
When we drove through it,
when the last time,

2929
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:25,370
not last time was in Dallas a couple 
times ago,

2930
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:26,900
but when we drove through it,
it's like,

2931
02:11:26,901 --> 02:11:27,830
it's eerie.
You're like,

2932
02:11:27,831 --> 02:11:29,100
wow,
this is.

2933
02:11:29,101 --> 02:11:31,460
It all happened right here.
I've been twice there and there's always

2934
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,630
a conspiracy people walking around there
looking for a tip.

2935
02:11:34,710 --> 02:11:36,280
I gave this guy 10 bucks and go,
all right,

2936
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:37,450
give me the whole story.
And Oh,

2937
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:39,500
he was very entertaining here.
Here's the Grassy Knoll,

2938
02:11:39,501 --> 02:11:42,030
the picket fence.
And he had another one about this man.

2939
02:11:42,050 --> 02:11:42,883
He took the manhole cover off because 
there was somebody down here in the 

2940
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:45,600
manhole.
Oh,

2941
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:46,790
lopped up.
Bam.

2942
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:47,624
Shot him,
went back down to the metal favorite DM 

2943
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:52,140
conspiracy is they believe that the 
driver turnaround shot.

2944
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:53,910
That's the best way.

2945
02:11:54,130 --> 02:11:55,520
Yeah.
Those are the spaces.

2946
02:11:55,521 --> 02:11:56,354
Fake people.
You're always going to get a bunch of 

2947
02:11:58,701 --> 02:12:02,360
really wacky conspiracies whenever 
anything happens in the news,

2948
02:12:02,361 --> 02:12:04,040
whatever it is,
you know,

2949
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:06,350
anything and everything,
particularly if it's big and famous.

2950
02:12:06,351 --> 02:12:07,184
Again,
back to this cognitive dissonance like 

2951
02:12:08,571 --> 02:12:10,400
Princess Di,
you know,

2952
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:12,290
cause of death,
drunk driving,

2953
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:13,250
speeding.
No seatbelt.

2954
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:14,583
You know,
tens of thousands of people died that 

2955
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,633
was drunk.
He was drunk yet the driver of her car 

2956
02:12:18,981 --> 02:12:20,290
was drunk.
I didn't know that.

2957
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:23,630
He was partially drunk.
He was tipsy drunk.

2958
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:25,041
Wow.
I didn't.

2959
02:12:25,041 --> 02:12:25,631
I didn't know.
Yeah,

2960
02:12:25,631 --> 02:12:27,020
that's right.
So drunk driving,

2961
02:12:27,021 --> 02:12:27,801
speeding.
And,

2962
02:12:27,801 --> 02:12:30,380
and she wasn't wearing a seatbelt.
Why wasn't she wearing a seatbelt?

2963
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:31,881
So,
I mean,

2964
02:12:31,881 --> 02:12:34,200
that's it,
but it doesn't feel like print.

2965
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:35,063
Someone like Princess Di should die the 
way tens of thousands of Americans die 

2966
02:12:37,801 --> 02:12:40,940
in automobiles every year.
It seems like there should be,

2967
02:12:40,941 --> 02:12:43,730
you know,
the [inaudible] and the royal family,

2968
02:12:43,731 --> 02:12:44,564
uh,
the Arabs and the Palestinians that 

2969
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:48,050
everybody was involved.

2970
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:49,453
Well,
here's an example of an absolute 

2971
02:12:50,481 --> 02:12:53,210
conspiracy that we know is,
was a conspiracy.

2972
02:12:53,370 --> 02:12:55,460
Jamal Sogi.
Yes.

2973
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,160
Right.
Yeah.

2974
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:58,280
A good example.
This kind of stuff does happen.

2975
02:12:58,310 --> 02:13:00,830
This is a real case.
That guy was murdered,

2976
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:05,780
he went to the Saudi embassy in Turkey.
They had him set up,

2977
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:09,800
they flew in 15 people,
including a guy who was a,

2978
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:15,150
he was a forensics expert and he was an 
expert in forensics,

2979
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:17,960
forensics evidence,
and they think that he was there to make

2980
02:13:17,961 --> 02:13:20,470
sure that there was nothing left behind.
They,

2981
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:24,410
this is the official story is they 
strangled him,

2982
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:27,230
caught him up,
and the,

2983
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:28,093
there's even recordings apparent that 
goes all the way to the listen to the 

2984
02:13:30,261 --> 02:13:31,680
top.
Saudi Arabia.

2985
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:33,233
What does this,
Jamie,

2986
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:36,390
that's the last video seeing him.
Oh,

2987
02:13:36,391 --> 02:13:39,840
the body double video of him walking in 
and then it's the last time you've seen.

2988
02:13:40,230 --> 02:13:41,330
Yeah,
he,

2989
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:42,183
he entered into there and there's 15 
different dudes that were waiting for 

2990
02:13:45,811 --> 02:13:46,260
them.

2991
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:48,480
They killed them,
chopped him up.

2992
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:49,343
And there's videos of those guys leaving
with suitcases and they say that the 

2993
02:13:52,711 --> 02:13:55,260
suitcases had his body in them chopped 
up.

2994
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:57,360
Yeah.
It's um,

2995
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:00,330
it's real,
but that's also,

2996
02:14:00,331 --> 02:14:01,830
you know,
Saudi Arabia,

2997
02:14:01,831 --> 02:14:05,520
they can get away with some pretty 
sketchy shit and it seems like nothing's

2998
02:14:05,521 --> 02:14:06,354
going to happen.
Right?

2999
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:08,100
Like people,
few people got fired.

3000
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:09,143
Well,
I have to say on this that I'm Michael 

3001
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:15,480
Moore's film on nine slash 11.
He made the point,

3002
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:16,314
I was the first I'd seen make the point 
that the Saudi Arabia family got out of 

3003
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:21,083
the United States on 9:12 when all 
flights were canceled and that Bush let 

3004
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:26,863
you know.
And now here we see that trump doesn't 

3005
02:14:29,281 --> 02:14:32,070
want to condemn the Saudis because 
they're our allies.

3006
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:33,733
So there's a bunch of shit in there.
It goes all the way back to nine slash 

3007
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:39,030
11.
And we know the Saudis support,

3008
02:14:39,031 --> 02:14:39,864
uh,
uh,

3009
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:43,290
bankrolled most of the 19 hijackers.

3010
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:46,830
Yeah.
So that's the kind of conspiracy that we

3011
02:14:46,831 --> 02:14:47,664
should be paying attention to.
Not that Bush was involved and made it 

3012
02:14:49,921 --> 02:14:50,754
happen in the secret.
This is the kind of shit that really 

3013
02:14:53,611 --> 02:14:54,960
happens in politics,
you know,

3014
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:55,794
people are our banking each other,
so we have to be nice to each other and 

3015
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:00,661
overlook it.
You know,

3016
02:15:00,661 --> 02:15:01,800
like when trump said,
you know,

3017
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:04,440
Putin,
Putin murders people,

3018
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:06,810
oh well everybody does it.
What

3019
02:15:08,790 --> 02:15:10,740
we do some terrible things to,
and,

3020
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,100
and,
and that's true.

3021
02:15:12,190 --> 02:15:14,240
And it's true.
And you know,

3022
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,470
I guess he's got a point,
but the.

3023
02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:19,590
Yeah,
it's just so there's so much money,

3024
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:21,510
so much money involved with Saudi 
Arabia.

3025
02:15:21,511 --> 02:15:24,380
In this article I was writing,
I cited a criminologist,

3026
02:15:24,381 --> 02:15:29,381
manual eisner in a study of 1500 
monarchs in 45 monarchies across Europe.

3027
02:15:31,381 --> 02:15:32,214
Between add 600 and 1800,
found that about 15 percent of them 227 

3028
02:15:37,501 --> 02:15:38,334
were assassinated chorus punting to 
homicide rate of about a thousand per 

3029
02:15:41,731 --> 02:15:44,400
100,000 ruler years,
10 times the background rate.

3030
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:45,833
So in other words,
assassinations in history are pretty 

3031
02:15:47,431 --> 02:15:48,264
common.
This is how power often changes hands 

3032
02:15:49,801 --> 02:15:53,040
before liberal democracies spread.
And after 19 seventies,

3033
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:57,090
this was not uncommon though,
so we shouldn't be surprised that people

3034
02:15:57,091 --> 02:16:01,110
believe this kind of stuff because you 
know there's some truth to that thing is

3035
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:05,010
unsettling to folks because what he was 
killed for,

3036
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:06,530
they think,
well there's.

3037
02:16:06,570 --> 02:16:08,430
There's two different versions of it,
right?

3038
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:09,323
There's this film.
He was killed for criticizing the Saudi 

3039
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:14,760
Arabian government,
but he was also.

3040
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:15,594
There was also that he was criticized 
because he was aware or he was killed 

3041
02:16:19,111 --> 02:16:19,944
rather because he was aware of some spy 
software that's being utilized and that 

3042
02:16:25,951 --> 02:16:26,784
if he wrote a story about this spy 
software being utilized by the Saudi 

3043
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:30,220
Arabian

3044
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:33,070
government,
that it would be a huge disaster.

3045
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:35,200
Mm hmm.
Could be.

3046
02:16:35,490 --> 02:16:36,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

3047
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:37,160
I mean there's more.
We,

3048
02:16:37,710 --> 02:16:39,580
I'm sure there's a lot we don't know.
So here's my,

3049
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:43,270
a concession to conspiracy theories.
When you get elected president,

3050
02:16:43,271 --> 02:16:44,530
they take you in the back room and they 
go,

3051
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:46,180
okay,
here's what's actually going on.

3052
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:47,260
Right?
Oh Shit.

3053
02:16:47,261 --> 02:16:48,094
I can't close Gitmo close.
Get bumped because no one will take 

3054
02:16:49,931 --> 02:16:50,890
those bed dudes.
Okay,

3055
02:16:50,891 --> 02:16:51,724
but,
but pull the troops out of Afghanistan 

3056
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:55,330
can't pull the troops out of Afghanistan
if we do that.

3057
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:57,190
Here's what happens.
Oh Shit.

3058
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:59,590
But we don't know this.
We know this.

3059
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,020
And I think that something like that 
does go on,

3060
02:17:02,021 --> 02:17:04,910
maybe not quite so secretly,
but just that you know,

3061
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:08,110
you and I don't need to know.
These things need to know basis.

3062
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:09,880
And,
and the president does.

3063
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:11,840
When their candidates,
they say,

3064
02:17:11,841 --> 02:17:13,420
oh,
whatever they say to get elected,

3065
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:14,920
and then they get in there and go,
oh,

3066
02:17:14,921 --> 02:17:15,754
okay,
I didn't realize that the Saudis are 

3067
02:17:16,961 --> 02:17:21,070
doing this and this and this and we need
them for these six reasons over here.

3068
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:22,353
Okay.
They did this bad thing and if we 

3069
02:17:23,111 --> 02:17:25,690
condemn them then they're not going to 
do these things over here,

3070
02:17:25,691 --> 02:17:29,800
so I better lay off the condemnation.
That kind of stuff I suspect does happen

3071
02:17:29,801 --> 02:17:30,970
a lot.
I think you're correct.

3072
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:34,930
I think I suspect the same thing.
Now what's fascinating to me about trump

3073
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:36,063
is that he doesn't seem to care at all 
about violating protocol or about 

3074
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:44,870
releasing information that he probably 
shouldn't be there.

3075
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:48,770
He's already accidentally released top 
secret information.

3076
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:54,190
I would just feel like if he knew for 
sure some,

3077
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:55,083
some stuff,
like he would be the last guy you would 

3078
02:17:57,311 --> 02:17:59,110
want to trust with that.
Right.

3079
02:18:00,190 --> 02:18:01,023
I know,
but you know this thing about him 

3080
02:18:02,111 --> 02:18:05,980
wanting to pull the troops out of Syria.
There's gotta be another story behind.

3081
02:18:05,981 --> 02:18:06,814
They're like,
you know,

3082
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:07,720
Putin maybe.
He said,

3083
02:18:07,721 --> 02:18:08,554
look,
we gotta take care of our business here 

3084
02:18:09,671 --> 02:18:10,504
in Syria.

3085
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:11,463
We're going to take care of Americans 
over here and you get your trump tower 

3086
02:18:15,161 --> 02:18:17,830
in red square when,
when I'm gone or whatever,

3087
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:18,664
you know,
there's some kind of.

3088
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,833
That kind of stuff is the sort of thing 
that will come out in a equivalent of a 

3089
02:18:22,571 --> 02:18:24,580
Wiki leaks in 20 years will go,
oh,

3090
02:18:24,581 --> 02:18:26,140
like the Gulf of Tonkin.
Oh,

3091
02:18:26,141 --> 02:18:27,280
okay.
That's what happened.

3092
02:18:27,281 --> 02:18:28,114
What do you think conspiracy theory that
says that trump has some video of trump 

3093
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:37,320
getting peed on or people
that was published in like some serious

3094
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:40,880
newspapers.
Yup.

3095
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,033
Yup.
There's so much of this stuff that I 

3096
02:18:43,481 --> 02:18:44,810
just can't keep track of it.
I mean,

3097
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:46,570
don't you think with him though too?
They'll,

3098
02:18:46,590 --> 02:18:49,900
they'll like,
read more than willing to put stuff like

3099
02:18:49,901 --> 02:18:51,460
that out there because they don't like 
them.

3100
02:18:51,461 --> 02:18:53,680
So they'll pull that trigger a little 
bit quicker maybe.

3101
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:55,240
Yep.
But you know,

3102
02:18:55,241 --> 02:18:58,470
during the Bush administration,
people hated George W dot Bush and hated

3103
02:18:58,500 --> 02:18:59,500
him as much as they hate trump.

3104
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:00,071
Uh,
no.

3105
02:19:00,071 --> 02:19:02,080
I think now they're going,
oh,

3106
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:03,830
we would love to have George W Bush 
back.

3107
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:06,310
I feel like they just thought he was 
incompetent.

3108
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:07,193
Although directly Putin does not deny 
possessing compromising material on 

3109
02:19:10,811 --> 02:19:12,960
trump.
Uh,

3110
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,650
but,
but what did he actually say?

3111
02:19:14,651 --> 02:19:15,730
Yeah.
I don't know.

3112
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:16,833
Yes,
this is about the pee tape says Matthew 

3113
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:22,360
Yglesias voc.
What is it from Volvo?

3114
02:19:22,361 --> 02:19:26,900
It's vox moving
doesn't mean a.

3115
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:29,030
He probably didn't understand what they 
were saying.

3116
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:30,180
Speaks Russian,
right?

3117
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:32,180
I Dunno.
Um,

3118
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:37,510
do you find it odd that the,
these conspiracies not only do,

3119
02:19:38,630 --> 02:19:42,860
it seems like it's a part of our,
our mind,

3120
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:44,023
the way our brains work,
our collective mindset is that we tend 

3121
02:19:47,781 --> 02:19:48,614
to be attracted to conspiracies and we 
tend to hope that those or true more 

3122
02:19:55,251 --> 02:19:58,010
than we hope a simple explanation 
exists.

3123
02:19:58,150 --> 02:19:59,080
Yeah.
Well,

3124
02:19:59,090 --> 02:19:59,923
it depends.
It depends on who your group is and do 

3125
02:20:03,261 --> 02:20:04,430
they have power or not.

3126
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:08,250
So we know from studies that people that
are out of power tend to consume,

3127
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:11,510
can concoct conspiracy theories about 
the,

3128
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:13,850
those in power.
And the moment they get empowered,

3129
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:15,860
they drop the conspiracy theories and 
the ones that are out.

3130
02:20:16,580 --> 02:20:17,413
Uh,
so you're going to get more conspiracy 

3131
02:20:18,681 --> 02:20:19,514
theories about Republicans when the 
Democrats are out of power from left 

3132
02:20:22,251 --> 02:20:23,084
leaning people and vice versa.
It blacks are more likely to think that 

3133
02:20:25,791 --> 02:20:28,980
the CIA planted crack cocaine in the 
inner cities and,

3134
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:30,290
and,
and those sorts of things.

3135
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:33,920
Conservatives are more likely to fear 
big government conspiracies.

3136
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:37,100
Liberals are more likely to fear big 
corporate conspiracies.

3137
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:39,230
It,
there may be elements of truth in all of

3138
02:20:39,231 --> 02:20:40,064
these things,
but the ones your latch onto have to do 

3139
02:20:43,161 --> 02:20:43,994
with how much power you perceive the 
other guy has that you don't have and 

3140
02:20:48,231 --> 02:20:50,390
therefore they must be doing something 
to get that,

3141
02:20:50,391 --> 02:20:51,320
that I can't do.

3142
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:52,153
I'm on the outside and so we tend to 
misperceive how much control and power 

3143
02:20:56,691 --> 02:20:59,030
people really have in positions of 
power.

3144
02:20:59,031 --> 02:21:01,310
Ceos,
politicians and so on.

3145
02:21:01,311 --> 02:21:06,311
Usually they don't have as much control 
and power as we think they do and people

3146
02:21:06,711 --> 02:21:07,550
that get in there,
they go,

3147
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:08,413
oh,
I can't,

3148
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:09,283
I can't.
I don't have this kind of controller 

3149
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:11,870
power.
I thought I would when I got here,

3150
02:21:11,871 --> 02:21:15,500
but obviously I don't do too many things
that have to do checks.

3151
02:21:15,501 --> 02:21:16,334
And balances that are in place,
so you can't do these things on your 

3152
02:21:19,041 --> 02:21:19,874
own.
You really need a group of people to 

3153
02:21:20,991 --> 02:21:21,824
conspire along with you.
So you mean to have these frank 

3154
02:21:23,781 --> 02:21:28,781
discussions with some sort of an 
understanding that you have to keep this

3155
02:21:30,081 --> 02:21:31,010
a secret,
right?

3156
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:32,950
Maura?
Yeah.

3157
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:33,983
In other words,
like 12 guys in London are going to 

3158
02:21:35,691 --> 02:21:36,800
control the world's economy.

3159
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:38,480
How are they going to do that?
I mean,

3160
02:21:38,481 --> 02:21:42,710
who do you call to start a war and cause
inflation or whatever.

3161
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:43,873
More likely.
It's like in the Cuban missile crisis 

3162
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:48,740
where you have jockeying back and forth,
back and forth,

3163
02:21:48,741 --> 02:21:49,940
back and forth.
Okay,

3164
02:21:49,941 --> 02:21:50,774
look,
we're going to give you the missiles in 

3165
02:21:52,131 --> 02:21:54,440
Turkey.
If you take the missiles out of Cuba.

3166
02:21:54,441 --> 02:21:59,240
And it just ends up being some boring 
little thing that dissolves the tension.

3167
02:21:59,241 --> 02:22:01,820
That could have been world war three.
It's like wow,

3168
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:02,683
just this little thing.
And so much of history turns on those 

3169
02:22:05,541 --> 02:22:06,110
little,
you know.

3170
02:22:06,110 --> 02:22:09,650
So in a way we got lucky there,
but not just luck.

3171
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:10,484
I mean,
Kennedy and Khrushchev both wanted to 

3172
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:14,570
untie the knot,
you know,

3173
02:22:14,610 --> 02:22:15,443
crew shift sent a memo to Kennedy saying
you have pulled on this rope and I have 

3174
02:22:19,011 --> 02:22:21,740
pulled on this rope and I don't know if 
either of us can untie it,

3175
02:22:21,741 --> 02:22:24,200
but here's an idea.
That's when he floated the,

3176
02:22:24,470 --> 02:22:25,860
you take the out of Turkey

3177
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:27,153
and,
and I was just watching this netflix 

3178
02:22:28,621 --> 02:22:29,454
documentary on this and there was a 
thing about Castro Santa memo to crew 

3179
02:22:33,051 --> 02:22:35,910
chef saying light them up,
you know,

3180
02:22:35,911 --> 02:22:38,430
comrade,
we are ready to die for the cause.

3181
02:22:38,431 --> 02:22:41,040
You can just nuke all of Cuba and nuke 
America.

3182
02:22:41,041 --> 02:22:42,270
I don't care.
We're ready to die.

3183
02:22:42,271 --> 02:22:45,150
And Khrushchev Khrushchev apparently was
like,

3184
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:46,770
holy fuck,
this guy's a madman.

3185
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:51,530
We're not going to do that.
And so that's true.

3186
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:53,390
He's ready to new Cuba.
Yeah.

3187
02:22:53,790 --> 02:22:56,010
Jesus,
where's that memo?

3188
02:22:56,930 --> 02:22:57,450
Uh,
they,

3189
02:22:57,450 --> 02:23:00,330
they talked about this in this duck.
The netflix.

3190
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:01,561
Yeah.
Anyway,

3191
02:23:01,561 --> 02:23:02,394
so this was during the times of 
operation northwoods when they were 

3192
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:08,500
gonna blow up a drone jetliner and blame
it on the Cubans arm,

3193
02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:11,280
Cuban friendlies to attack Montana Mo 
Bay.

3194
02:23:11,281 --> 02:23:14,280
And use it as a motivation to get us 
into war.

3195
02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:15,523
That Castro is a fascinating case 
because that guy kept that place 90 

3196
02:23:19,231 --> 02:23:20,670
miles away from Miami.

3197
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:24,090
He kept that place running on his own 
until he died.

3198
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:26,850
That was crazy.
Really.

3199
02:23:26,851 --> 02:23:28,830
It's crazy that he was able to pull that
off.

3200
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:30,750
Well,
he had a lot of support,

3201
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:34,740
economic support from Russia otherwise.
And that would not have succeeded,

3202
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:36,113
but still it's so nuts that he was so 
close and he was running a military 

3203
02:23:39,751 --> 02:23:42,150
dictatorship.
Essentially a boat ride away.

3204
02:23:42,220 --> 02:23:43,053
Yeah.
I was just in Moscow a few months ago 

3205
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:47,910
for a conference since I went to visit 
their world war two museum,

3206
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:49,650
what we would call a world war two 
museum,

3207
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:54,710
just massive building it and they call 
it the Great Patriotic War Museum.

3208
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:56,933
And the whole thing is kind of attribute
to Russia liberated Europe from the 

3209
02:24:02,050 --> 02:24:03,510
Nazis.
Yup.

3210
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:05,190
This is current.
Oh yeah,

3211
02:24:05,191 --> 02:24:07,560
yeah.
I mean this is from their perspective,

3212
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:11,070
they lost 27 million people.
You Americans,

3213
02:24:11,071 --> 02:24:12,870
you know,
500,000 nothing.

3214
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:14,830
Right.
And from their perspective.

3215
02:24:14,831 --> 02:24:19,110
And you go to Berlin right next to the 
victory museum.

3216
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:20,210
Look at that.
Yeah.

3217
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:22,200
It's called the victory museum.
Well,

3218
02:24:22,201 --> 02:24:24,810
there it is.
The Museum of the Great Patriotic War is

3219
02:24:24,811 --> 02:24:25,644
a history museum located in Muskoka yet.
And they have this room with these 

3220
02:24:29,881 --> 02:24:30,714
chains hanging down with little crystal 
balls at the end of them that represent 

3221
02:24:33,961 --> 02:24:35,820
the 27 million people.
And it's,

3222
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,100
it's,
it's very moving.

3223
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:39,240
Go back to that.
That right there is good.

3224
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:41,970
Look how beautiful that place.
It's quite stunning.

3225
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:45,270
And each of those rooms that you go 
into,

3226
02:24:45,271 --> 02:24:48,000
it's like a diagram of some battle that 
they fought.

3227
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:51,750
We,
I think it's good for us to know this,

3228
02:24:51,751 --> 02:24:54,540
to recognize from their perspective 
they,

3229
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:56,370
they,
they won the war,

3230
02:24:56,371 --> 02:24:57,204
not the British American and French.
We did a little bit from their 

3231
02:25:00,121 --> 02:25:00,954
perspective,
but the fact that they lost so many 

3232
02:25:03,451 --> 02:25:04,560
people,
27 million.

3233
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:07,860
What's going on with that picture?
I don't remember.

3234
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:12,090
Fucked up looking at the present.
That's a weird picture.

3235
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:13,173
Um,
I mean they have a point in terms of 

3236
02:25:15,181 --> 02:25:17,880
their contribution in terms of the loss 
of lives.

3237
02:25:17,970 --> 02:25:18,860
Yeah.
That's A.

3238
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,140
I mean every country has its 
perspectives in that regard,

3239
02:25:22,141 --> 02:25:24,250
which is why it's good to some history,
so you know

3240
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,950
what other people are thinking and what 
they went through.

3241
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:28,180
Well,
it's again though,

3242
02:25:28,181 --> 02:25:29,014
it's very similar to what we're talking 
about earlier in terms of the 

3243
02:25:31,691 --> 02:25:32,524
distribution of the news.
It would be very nice if there was one 

3244
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:39,580
absolute news source you can trust with 
no slant on it whatsoever.

3245
02:25:39,581 --> 02:25:42,070
When it comes to the distribution of 
history,

3246
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:43,263
it's of course always written in a way 
that favors the people that are writing 

3247
02:25:47,770 --> 02:25:48,430
it.
Yeah.

3248
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:52,540
I was just talking to Rachel Kleinfeld.
I have a podcast now,

3249
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:56,670
a few months.
That's six months now.

3250
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:58,690
It's science salon podcast.
Yeah.

3251
02:25:58,930 --> 02:26:03,250
Well it's sort of an extension of our 
old caltech lecture series,

3252
02:26:03,251 --> 02:26:04,084
but instead of lectures we're not doing 
dialogue you called so people can see 

3253
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,560
science salon,
science salon.

3254
02:26:08,561 --> 02:26:10,030
Yep.
So just skeptic.com.

3255
02:26:10,031 --> 02:26:10,864
It's okay.
So I'm interviewing are dialoguing with 

3256
02:26:13,090 --> 02:26:16,810
Rachel Kleinfeld.
She has a new book called a savage order

3257
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:18,143
and it's about failed states and what 
happens to them and why corruption 

3258
02:26:21,191 --> 02:26:22,150
spread so quickly.

3259
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:22,983
And then how to basically squelch that.
So like after the Soviet Union fell 

3260
02:26:26,471 --> 02:26:27,700
apart,
you know,

3261
02:26:27,701 --> 02:26:31,510
all these mobs basically took over and 
it's like the Russian mafia,

3262
02:26:31,710 --> 02:26:35,500
the Republic of Georgia fell apart 
fairly quickly and then,

3263
02:26:35,501 --> 02:26:36,334
you know,
so one of the reasons people apparently 

3264
02:26:37,691 --> 02:26:39,410
like Putin is he kind of came in and,
and,

3265
02:26:39,411 --> 02:26:41,750
and squelched all that.
And,

3266
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:42,673
and maybe one of his points of 
popularity is that at least we have one 

3267
02:26:46,361 --> 02:26:47,194
bad guy who's got kind of keeping an 
order instead of all these little 

3268
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:52,200
mafioso type gangs.
And uh,

3269
02:26:52,890 --> 02:26:55,390
and I said,
so if he actually held an election,

3270
02:26:55,391 --> 02:26:56,490
he might win.
It's like,

3271
02:26:56,530 --> 02:26:57,363
it's hard to say because we don't have a
good source of what the Russian people 

3272
02:26:59,921 --> 02:27:00,754
really like.
We have the Russian media saying the 

3273
02:27:02,921 --> 02:27:05,350
Russian people love Putin.
Okay.

3274
02:27:06,810 --> 02:27:10,570
Do we know that's an accurate survey?
Is Pretty astonishing.

3275
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:13,720
What kind of a control he has over the 
country though?

3276
02:27:14,530 --> 02:27:16,000
Yeah,
it's powerful.

3277
02:27:16,001 --> 02:27:16,834
I went to visit a lot.
I saw Lenin's tomb and the Mazda Liam 

3278
02:27:18,911 --> 02:27:21,190
there,
he's still still looking pretty waxy,

3279
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:22,083
uh,
to me.

3280
02:27:22,330 --> 02:27:22,901
Oh,
that's right.

3281
02:27:22,901 --> 02:27:25,680
You can actually see his body or what's 
the.

3282
02:27:25,810 --> 02:27:26,680
His body.
Yeah.

3283
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:27,573
Yeah.
What's left of it yet another netflix 

3284
02:27:29,651 --> 02:27:31,930
series.
I just binge watched Trotsky.

3285
02:27:31,931 --> 02:27:35,020
It's called Trotsky and this is a 
Russian made film.

3286
02:27:35,021 --> 02:27:39,700
It's a drama and um,
it's really good and it really shows.

3287
02:27:39,730 --> 02:27:40,563
It's interesting because he,
Trotsky was on the outs all the way 

3288
02:27:43,061 --> 02:27:43,894
until just recently because Stalin had 
him sas donated and then on had him 

3289
02:27:48,011 --> 02:27:48,844
literally airbrushed out of photographs 
because for awhile it was Lenin and 

3290
02:27:52,091 --> 02:27:52,924
Stalin.
Trotsky is the big three and then when 

3291
02:27:56,261 --> 02:27:58,120
Lenin had a stroke it was like,
okay,

3292
02:27:58,121 --> 02:27:58,954
so Stalin and Trotsky,
who's going to take over when the boss 

3293
02:28:01,931 --> 02:28:03,880
is gone?
And uh,

3294
02:28:03,881 --> 02:28:05,560
so they kind of showed how that 
happened.

3295
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:06,910
And again,
conspiracy.

3296
02:28:06,911 --> 02:28:07,744
It's all conspiracy.
No one knows what's really going on 

3297
02:28:09,791 --> 02:28:11,620
here.
You've been in this business,

3298
02:28:11,650 --> 02:28:15,580
this debunking conspiracy conspiracy's 
in the skeptic business for quite a long

3299
02:28:15,581 --> 02:28:16,414
time.
Do you feel like there is any 

3300
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:22,100
improvement in the critical thinking 
skills of people and their ability

3301
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:22,933
to recognize the fallacies and the flaws
in the way they're approaching these 

3302
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:30,140
things?
Hard to say.

3303
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:33,740
Confirmation bias there,
less of that now than before,

3304
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:38,210
like to think we're having an influence.
There is some studies that show,

3305
02:28:38,211 --> 02:28:39,044
you know,
fewer people believe in these pseudo 

3306
02:28:40,570 --> 02:28:43,340
sciences and quackery and paranormal,
but it's not.

3307
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:47,270
The declines are not that dramatic over 
say the last few decades.

3308
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:49,623
There are deprogramming bias,
deprogramming studies and programs in 

3309
02:28:54,830 --> 02:28:55,663
which you can teach people about the 
confirmation bias in the hindsight bias 

3310
02:28:57,861 --> 02:28:58,694
and so on.
The problem with those is they work 

3311
02:29:00,021 --> 02:29:03,260
really well to teach people how to spot 
the biases and other people.

3312
02:29:03,290 --> 02:29:05,310
They're really good at that.
But then you say,

3313
02:29:05,311 --> 02:29:05,990
well,
what about you?

3314
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:07,850
Oh know,
fortunately I'm above all that.

3315
02:29:09,410 --> 02:29:11,540
There's a blind spot that's called the 
blind spot bias.

3316
02:29:11,541 --> 02:29:13,820
You can't see your own bias,
but you can see it in other people.

3317
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:15,381
Um,
so the,

3318
02:29:15,381 --> 02:29:16,214
um,
the reason these studies are done is 

3319
02:29:16,971 --> 02:29:20,000
because we have a problem with climate 
change.

3320
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:21,193
We have climate deniers.
How do we get people who don't know 

3321
02:29:22,851 --> 02:29:26,210
anything about it to shift from?
I'm a skeptic too.

3322
02:29:26,211 --> 02:29:27,044
I'm a believer and it shows,
it turns out just piling on facts isn't 

3323
02:29:31,521 --> 02:29:32,354
going to do it.
No people's identity are trapped in 

3324
02:29:35,271 --> 02:29:36,104
their initial initial statements.
If they think that nine slash 11 was a 

3325
02:29:39,621 --> 02:29:40,454
conspiracy there,
their identity is somehow inexorably 

3326
02:29:44,420 --> 02:29:46,850
connected to this conspiracy being a 
fact,

3327
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:50,090
and then you argue it as if you're 
arguing your own value.

3328
02:29:50,430 --> 02:29:54,590
It's a really weird thing that happens 
when people start talking about ideas.

3329
02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:56,630
If the you,
you,

3330
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:57,473
you've very rarely find people that are 
disconnected from their ideas to the 

3331
02:30:01,041 --> 02:30:03,830
point where you could point out that 
something's incorrect and they go,

3332
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:05,030
oh,
thank you.

3333
02:30:05,031 --> 02:30:05,864
I didn't know that.

3334
02:30:06,170 --> 02:30:08,820
Like most people aren't really that 
confident now,

3335
02:30:08,990 --> 02:30:12,710
or are they just look at it the wrong.
It feels like a personal attack on them.

3336
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:13,490
Also as,
uh,

3337
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:14,323
if it's a belief or claim or theory or 
whatever affiliated with a political or 

3338
02:30:17,961 --> 02:30:18,794
moral or religious value,
the people autocorrect in their brains 

3339
02:30:23,331 --> 02:30:26,090
when they hear global warming,
they hear liberalism,

3340
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:28,010
communism,
capitalism,

3341
02:30:28,011 --> 02:30:29,960
control of the market,
big government.

3342
02:30:29,961 --> 02:30:33,440
And I'm against those things so that 
global warming things got to be faults.

3343
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:36,890
That is one of the weirder aspects of 
tribal thinking,

3344
02:30:36,891 --> 02:30:38,810
right?
Pink or makes the point that,

3345
02:30:38,811 --> 02:30:40,970
uh,
Al Gore's film an inconvenient truth was

3346
02:30:40,971 --> 02:30:41,804
a terrible thing for the environmental 
movement because at associated global 

3347
02:30:44,241 --> 02:30:48,770
climate change with liberalism,
the Democrats and all that,

3348
02:30:48,830 --> 02:30:49,461
it's like,
oh,

3349
02:30:49,461 --> 02:30:51,410
okay,
I see what's going on.

3350
02:30:51,411 --> 02:30:54,510
It's that Al Gore left liberal stuff.
That's right.

3351
02:30:55,130 --> 02:30:57,030
Yeah.
Well in,

3352
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:58,400
in,
in a sense he's right.

3353
02:30:58,460 --> 02:30:59,293
And then in another sense it was also 
the amount of profit that alcor made 

3354
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:04,800
both from that and from some other 
endeavors that he has.

3355
02:31:05,110 --> 02:31:07,310
They said that he's one of the first 
green billionaires.

3356
02:31:08,010 --> 02:31:09,380
So God,
Jesus,

3357
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:14,690
what's his carbon footprint is around a 
private jet everywhere.

3358
02:31:14,691 --> 02:31:16,350
He's talking about the world.
Yeah.

3359
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:18,020
It's like,
it's screwy.

3360
02:31:18,220 --> 02:31:19,930
Yeah.
But that's,

3361
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:20,640
you know,
there's,

3362
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,410
everything's messy.
People are messy,

3363
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:24,600
right?
So we're very tribal.

3364
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:25,913
We commit to political parties or 
religious beliefs and we stick by them 

3365
02:31:28,681 --> 02:31:30,930
pretty closely,
a pretty tightly.

3366
02:31:31,650 --> 02:31:34,080
And the facts get filtered through 
those.

3367
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:35,680
Understandably,
um,

3368
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,020
you know,
what to do about it,

3369
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:38,730
you know,
that's,

3370
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,340
that's under debate it.
Same thing with the atheist debating.

3371
02:31:41,341 --> 02:31:44,510
How do we get people to leave religion?
Well,

3372
02:31:44,850 --> 02:31:48,840
just there's 100 ways you know,
Leah Remini on her show on scientology.

3373
02:31:49,290 --> 02:31:51,120
Anyone watching that would think,
okay,

3374
02:31:51,121 --> 02:31:51,954
I'm not joining this church,
and so if you had a thousand of those 

3375
02:31:54,931 --> 02:31:58,290
for bad beliefs,
hopefully we see that shift.

3376
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:03,390
I would love it if there was some sort 
of a secular option of community driven,

3377
02:32:03,450 --> 02:32:04,283
ethics driven,
morality driven friendship driven thing 

3378
02:32:08,791 --> 02:32:11,550
where people could go and instead 
worship,

3379
02:32:11,610 --> 02:32:16,610
maybe just appreciate life and sort of 
confirm some of the best aspects of,

3380
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:20,063
of community and culture and who we are 
and do it in a place where it makes you 

3381
02:32:23,281 --> 02:32:25,440
really conscious of it.
So because I think there's,

3382
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:26,573
there's some,
some real benefit to people going to 

3383
02:32:28,801 --> 02:32:29,634
church and everyone in the community 
community dresses up nice and you sort 

3384
02:32:33,631 --> 02:32:34,470
of agreeing,
hey,

3385
02:32:34,471 --> 02:32:35,304
we're committed to being civil and to 
being kind and to worshiping and that 

3386
02:32:39,571 --> 02:32:42,890
this belief in a higher power.
If it it,

3387
02:32:42,910 --> 02:32:46,350
it,
it empowers people to think this way and

3388
02:32:46,351 --> 02:32:47,184
it gives people a motivation to be kind.
And it would be nice if there was a 

3389
02:32:51,031 --> 02:32:53,700
secular option like that.
That is decentralized.

3390
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:54,743
It's not run by one person who winds up 
banging everybody's wife and taken all 

3391
02:32:57,511 --> 02:32:59,560
the money because that's what happens.
Always happens.

3392
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:02,850
You can set your clock by these guys.
It's unbelievable.

3393
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:06,090
The humanist movement is something like 
that.

3394
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:07,013
What is this?
I'm not aware of secular humanist or 

3395
02:33:08,161 --> 02:33:08,994
just humanists.
There's groups all over the world have 

3396
02:33:10,891 --> 02:33:12,060
churches.
Well,

3397
02:33:12,061 --> 02:33:14,100
they have meeting places,
I would call them churches,

3398
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:15,360
uh,
more broadly.

3399
02:33:15,361 --> 02:33:19,740
The kind of universalist unitarian 
church is a church and it's a religion,

3400
02:33:19,741 --> 02:33:22,590
but they're pretty secular.
They're like secular Jews,

3401
02:33:22,591 --> 02:33:25,170
you know,
they believe in the culture and the,

3402
02:33:25,470 --> 02:33:26,303
and the ceremonies and the rituals.
I've been to a number of these humanist 

3403
02:33:29,191 --> 02:33:32,610
and universalist unitarian churches 
ceremonies.

3404
02:33:32,611 --> 02:33:35,220
They light candles.
They sing hymns to Newton.

3405
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,513
Uh,
they have testimonials about how I lost 

3406
02:33:37,951 --> 02:33:40,290
my religion.
And to me,

3407
02:33:40,291 --> 02:33:41,124
I didn't really like it that much 
because I was never crazy about church 

3408
02:33:43,351 --> 02:33:44,184
in the first place,
but a lot of people clearly get value 

3409
02:33:46,111 --> 02:33:50,850
out of this atheists and humanists that 
don't believe in God.

3410
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:56,480
The gathering together once a week and 
being with fellow likeminded people that

3411
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:01,590
has a lot of psychological value.
It connects people and that's one of the

3412
02:34:01,591 --> 02:34:03,750
great things about community centers in 
neighborhoods,

3413
02:34:03,751 --> 02:34:05,520
you know,
it just connects people and like,

3414
02:34:05,521 --> 02:34:06,690
hey,
we're all in this together.

3415
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:07,621
All right,
Bob,

3416
02:34:07,621 --> 02:34:10,230
see you tomorrow.
Bye Mary social capital.

3417
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:11,453
There's something,
there's something great about that with 

3418
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:14,153
Church that uh,
I mean I was having this conversation 

3419
02:34:16,261 --> 02:34:18,130
with bill burr about this recently.
We were talking

3420
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:20,530
about it and he's like,
I don't really want to go to church,

3421
02:34:20,531 --> 02:34:24,100
but I think there's some,
something to that to go into a place and

3422
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:28,310
putting your faith in all the people 
around you and the,

3423
02:34:28,311 --> 02:34:28,800
the,
the,

3424
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:33,240
the higher values and morals and ethics 
that you're all agreeing to,

3425
02:34:33,250 --> 02:34:34,020
right?
Yup.

3426
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:36,790
You know,
it's back to the self help thing is sort

3427
02:34:36,791 --> 02:34:39,490
of a reminder every week.
Be a good person.

3428
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:42,820
Don't forget to donate to charity.
Here's some local charities here.

3429
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:45,040
These are our causes.
Be Good,

3430
02:34:45,430 --> 02:34:48,040
be good,
be nice to your spouse and your children

3431
02:34:48,041 --> 02:34:48,874
is on.
And so people kind of leave a little 

3432
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:52,990
charged up for the week on Sunday,
back to Monday.

3433
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:55,840
And that's probably the main draw of 
those big Tony Robbins things too.

3434
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:58,780
There's a community of us together.
We're all trying to do better.

3435
02:34:59,050 --> 02:35:02,020
We're all trying to better ourselves and
optimize our lives.

3436
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:03,280
That's right.
There's nothing wrong with it.

3437
02:35:03,281 --> 02:35:04,690
Same thing.
Back to Jordan Peterson.

3438
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:05,640
That's the threat.
He's,

3439
02:35:05,650 --> 02:35:07,600
he's given a message.
People like to hear that.

3440
02:35:07,601 --> 02:35:08,920
Yeah.
And okay.

3441
02:35:08,921 --> 02:35:10,480
So what,
why is that bad?

3442
02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:11,640
It's not bad.
Yeah.

3443
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:14,230
Now of course people like Richard 
Dawkins will point out,

3444
02:35:14,231 --> 02:35:14,590
yeah,
but,

3445
02:35:14,590 --> 02:35:19,570
but can we decouple all the supernatural
nonsense from the social community?

3446
02:35:19,571 --> 02:35:20,404
Yes,
we can.

3447
02:35:20,890 --> 02:35:21,723
But don't you think that there's less,
there's less of an acceptance of the 

3448
02:35:24,281 --> 02:35:27,460
supernatural nonsense than there was 50 
years ago,

3449
02:35:27,461 --> 02:35:29,410
100 years ago.
And it seems to be a trend.

3450
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:31,300
Those members are getting bad.
Secularism.

3451
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:32,613
The number of the percentage of nones,
people tick the box for no religious 

3452
02:35:35,021 --> 02:35:36,270
affiliation,
uh,

3453
02:35:36,490 --> 02:35:39,730
that used to be in the single digits.
It's now 25 percent of all Americans.

3454
02:35:39,731 --> 02:35:42,910
Thirty three percent of millennials.
Those born after 1991.

3455
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:44,343
And it looks like probably with 
identities can be closer to 50 percent 

3456
02:35:46,631 --> 02:35:48,160
people born after 1995.

3457
02:35:49,100 --> 02:35:51,340
Now they're not necessarily atheists,
agnostics,

3458
02:35:51,341 --> 02:35:52,174
skeptics,
but they don't affiliate with any 

3459
02:35:53,561 --> 02:35:54,394
religion.
And that's good because in the sense 

3460
02:35:57,281 --> 02:35:58,120
that,
uh,

3461
02:35:58,580 --> 02:35:59,413
it's religious behavior that causes some
of these social problems that we are 

3462
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:05,500
encountering now with Islam.
For example.

3463
02:36:06,030 --> 02:36:06,820
Um,
you know,

3464
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:10,720
so if somebody privately believes in God
or whatever and they don't act on it,

3465
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:12,040
okay,
I guess I don't care.

3466
02:36:12,460 --> 02:36:13,293
And that's it.
It's the acting on your beliefs that 

3467
02:36:14,591 --> 02:36:15,780
causes the problem.
Well,

3468
02:36:15,781 --> 02:36:17,680
when you enforce those beliefs on other 
people,

3469
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:20,380
that's right.
So when it spills over into politics,

3470
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:22,360
education,
science education,

3471
02:36:22,361 --> 02:36:23,140
particular,
well,

3472
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:23,973
that's one of the real problems they're 
having in Europe when they're dealing 

3473
02:36:25,721 --> 02:36:26,554
with people that are coming over from 
other countries where they have a 

3474
02:36:28,481 --> 02:36:29,314
different set of values and they're 
seeing women in skirts and they're 

3475
02:36:30,971 --> 02:36:33,430
calling them whores,
bro.

3476
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:35,000
You're in England,
right?

3477
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:39,610
Different set of rules over here in 
California.

3478
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:42,850
You won't believe it.
And they think that God has,

3479
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,713
you know,
God has dictated these rules are in 

3480
02:36:45,541 --> 02:36:47,470
their eyes.
They're seeing some horrible sin.

3481
02:36:47,471 --> 02:36:50,800
They're seeing the decay of the moral 
fiber,

3482
02:36:50,830 --> 02:36:55,240
the moral fiber of their environment.
These are primitive beliefs having to do

3483
02:36:55,241 --> 02:36:59,050
with men wanting to control women's 
reproductive rights.

3484
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:03,510
There's evolutionary reasons for this.
You had Brett and heather on here.

3485
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:06,130
They get explained that beautifully,
um,

3486
02:37:06,270 --> 02:37:07,103
at.
But we have to overcome that just 

3487
02:37:08,111 --> 02:37:08,944
because it's an evolved tendency for men
to want to control women's reproduction 

3488
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:14,740
a doesn't mean we should do that.
The opposite.

3489
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:16,130
Yeah.
And,

3490
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:17,630
uh,
so I make the case,

3491
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:20,020
uh,
one of my scientific American columns on

3492
02:37:20,030 --> 02:37:21,510
abortion that,
you know,

3493
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:25,380
if our mutual goal between pro lifers 
and protracer is,

3494
02:37:25,381 --> 02:37:28,970
is to reduce the amount of abortions we,
we know the formula,

3495
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,730
educate women,
empower women versus control,

3496
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:33,950
birth control,
access to birth control,

3497
02:37:34,310 --> 02:37:34,850
and so on.

3498
02:37:34,850 --> 02:37:38,180
It just happens automatically.
The pregnancy rates go down,

3499
02:37:38,181 --> 02:37:40,010
therefore abortion rates are going to go
down.

3500
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:41,320
We know how this,
uh,

3501
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:44,630
do this,
but still people that pro lifers,

3502
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:46,970
you know,
to start a glom on to it,

3503
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,770
but it's a moral issue.
Okay?

3504
02:37:48,771 --> 02:37:49,604
Take the moral out of it.
I understand it's a human life or 

3505
02:37:51,381 --> 02:37:53,030
potential human,
the whatever you want to argue.

3506
02:37:53,031 --> 02:37:54,410
I get on the.
Take that out.

3507
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:55,693
Let's just work to the common goal of 
reducing the number of unwanted 

3508
02:37:58,341 --> 02:37:59,174
pregnancies.
My favorite one that still exists is 

3509
02:38:01,431 --> 02:38:02,264
abstinence.
The idea that they're trying to push 

3510
02:38:03,951 --> 02:38:06,290
this on these.
Essentially when you.

3511
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:09,830
Especially we're talking about really 
young people that are just getting horny

3512
02:38:09,831 --> 02:38:10,700
for the first time.

3513
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:12,750
Yeah,
I mean they're on drugs.

3514
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:13,733
Just say no,
why are you talking about you take the 

3515
02:38:16,741 --> 02:38:20,100
average 17,
18 year old kids and you try to get them

3516
02:38:20,101 --> 02:38:20,934
together and no one's in the room and 
they're aging raging with hormones and 

3517
02:38:25,921 --> 02:38:28,020
they're both supposed to keep their 
clothes on like,

3518
02:38:28,021 --> 02:38:28,854
look,
man,

3519
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:32,070
it's not going to happen.
It's just not going to happen.

3520
02:38:32,071 --> 02:38:32,904
You've got to let that go and this idea 
that you're going to tell them that God 

3521
02:38:35,521 --> 02:38:38,160
wants them to be abstinent like,
are you sure?

3522
02:38:38,670 --> 02:38:40,770
Why did he give us these goddamn 
hormones?

3523
02:38:41,160 --> 02:38:42,180
What's happening here?

3524
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:43,453
There studies on how effective 
abstinence only programs or chastity 

3525
02:38:46,341 --> 02:38:48,340
pledges and these sorts of things,
how effective.

3526
02:38:48,570 --> 02:38:49,403
Not only are they not effective,
they're worse because then people go 

3527
02:38:52,101 --> 02:38:55,700
into like a date or something,
unprepared band,

3528
02:38:55,701 --> 02:38:56,534
the hormones kick in and they start 
going at it and then they don't have 

3529
02:38:59,631 --> 02:39:01,340
protection.
Well,

3530
02:39:01,341 --> 02:39:02,930
there's also the thing where

3531
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:06,440
Catholic schools,
like when I was a kid,

3532
02:39:06,770 --> 02:39:10,400
we always knew and like this is what 
we're talking about in the eighties,

3533
02:39:10,730 --> 02:39:13,430
everyone knew the girls who went to all 
girls,

3534
02:39:13,431 --> 02:39:14,264
Catholic schools were freaks because 
they were never around boys because 

3535
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:20,540
they're all in just this school with 
girls with they end there.

3536
02:39:20,541 --> 02:39:22,130
Everything is suppression.
Suppress,

3537
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:23,120
suppress,
suppress.

3538
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:27,560
They just can't wait to get out there.
They find a boy and they go crazy.

3539
02:39:27,740 --> 02:39:29,480
Like everybody knew it.
I mean,

3540
02:39:29,481 --> 02:39:30,314
this is not something that I knew as a 
comedian or as a person who studies 

3541
02:39:33,081 --> 02:39:33,914
culture.
This is something I knew as a 14 year 

3542
02:39:35,481 --> 02:39:38,810
old.
Everyone knew that girls who went to all

3543
02:39:38,811 --> 02:39:41,540
school,
all girl Catholic schools were freaks,

3544
02:39:41,570 --> 02:39:42,403
right?
It's just as the opposite intended 

3545
02:39:44,091 --> 02:39:44,924
effect.

3546
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:45,843
There was a study,
a British study I found that found some 

3547
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:49,443
small part.
It was like one and a half percent or 

3548
02:39:50,261 --> 02:39:54,790
whatever of 10,000 women who said they 
got pregnant without having sex.

3549
02:39:55,140 --> 02:39:55,973
Oh,
that happened.

3550
02:39:56,130 --> 02:39:57,610
It happened.
How did that happen?

3551
02:39:57,611 --> 02:40:01,270
It doesn't happen.
So immaculate conception.

3552
02:40:01,271 --> 02:40:02,880
That's right.
It's hilarious.

3553
02:40:02,890 --> 02:40:04,960
Yeah.
Or they do everything but.

3554
02:40:05,350 --> 02:40:06,970
Or they had anal or whatever and say,
well,

3555
02:40:06,971 --> 02:40:08,160
we didn't actually have sex,
you know,

3556
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:09,011
like Clinton,
you know.

3557
02:40:09,011 --> 02:40:10,660
Well,
what do you mean by sex?

3558
02:40:10,661 --> 02:40:14,080
And have sexual as soon as he

3559
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:14,953
will.
I did not have sexual relations with 

3560
02:40:16,861 --> 02:40:19,980
that woman is landscape.
Sex is intercourse,

3561
02:40:20,010 --> 02:40:20,910
penis,
Vagina.

3562
02:40:20,911 --> 02:40:23,160
That's it.
Everything else is just hanging out.

3563
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:27,420
Right?
Well,

3564
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:29,100
it's the,
the,

3565
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:32,550
the need for belief systems is.
It's so.

3566
02:40:32,730 --> 02:40:33,580
I mean,
it,

3567
02:40:33,581 --> 02:40:34,414
it helps people to have belief systems.
If they're positive and they're 

3568
02:40:36,871 --> 02:40:38,860
objective and their well-reasoned in 
there,

3569
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:43,590
you know,
these are backed by facts and knowledge.

3570
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:44,513
It helps,
but the need for belief systems is so 

3571
02:40:47,401 --> 02:40:51,960
strong that will take a belief system 
that's wonky because.

3572
02:40:51,961 --> 02:40:53,850
Because we,
we have that desire.

3573
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,170
Yup.
Yeah.

3574
02:40:55,171 --> 02:40:56,004
The brain abhors a vacuum of belief is 
the way I put it in and something's 

3575
02:41:00,711 --> 02:41:01,544
going to be in there.
So let's try to put in those brains 

3576
02:41:03,481 --> 02:41:07,890
rational science based values,
and we had those,

3577
02:41:07,891 --> 02:41:09,180
I mean,
humanist values that,

3578
02:41:09,181 --> 02:41:11,060
you know,
the humanist movement is now about a,

3579
02:41:11,061 --> 02:41:15,630
sent almost a century old universal 
human rights.

3580
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,320
Uh,
the,

3581
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:19,950
the Universal Human Rights Declaration 
just celebrated its 50th anniversary.

3582
02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:22,080
You can get diverse.
People do agree.

3583
02:41:22,730 --> 02:41:23,563
Uh,
you don't have to have the correct 

3584
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:26,600
philosophical arguments to get there,
but you know,

3585
02:41:26,610 --> 02:41:28,890
just everybody should be treated equally
under the law.

3586
02:41:28,891 --> 02:41:30,570
Can we at least agree on that?
Yes.

3587
02:41:30,571 --> 02:41:31,800
Okay.
Uh,

3588
02:41:31,830 --> 02:41:32,663
I mean,
if you start off with pinker makes this 

3589
02:41:33,751 --> 02:41:36,930
point lightened manal.
If you start off with Jesus died for our

3590
02:41:36,931 --> 02:41:37,764
sins,
that's the most important value built 

3591
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:40,213
value to me.
You're not going to get agreement in a 

3592
02:41:41,491 --> 02:41:42,324
room full of,
you know,

3593
02:41:42,430 --> 02:41:43,263
UN diversity.
You got to start with something super 

3594
02:41:45,961 --> 02:41:49,560
basic and general.
Everybody's deserves equal rights.

3595
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:50,250
Okay?
Yep.

3596
02:41:50,250 --> 02:41:52,470
And then you start to build from there 
and we can do that.

3597
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:53,873
Do you find you've been in this for a 
long time and you've done some really 

3598
02:41:56,551 --> 02:41:57,730
valuable work?
It's been,

3599
02:41:57,740 --> 02:41:58,573
it's,
it's so nice that there's someone like 

3600
02:42:00,031 --> 02:42:04,860
you that really has dedicated their life
to really illuminating truth,

3601
02:42:04,890 --> 02:42:07,200
exposing all the flaws and people's 
thinking.

3602
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:10,710
Do you feel like the reception of this 
is you're,

3603
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:15,600
it's easier now or there's momentum 
behind this kind of thinking?

3604
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:17,460
I do,
yeah,

3605
02:42:17,550 --> 02:42:19,200
for sure.
It's more open Po,

3606
02:42:19,230 --> 02:42:21,450
po part of my.
I have a distorted view.

3607
02:42:21,451 --> 02:42:23,730
I'm from California.
I grew up in southern California.

3608
02:42:23,731 --> 02:42:24,564
We're pretty liberal society here,
so I'm empathetic to people that write 

3609
02:42:27,721 --> 02:42:30,870
me from Oklahoma or Arkansas and I'm in 
this little town.

3610
02:42:30,871 --> 02:42:31,704
Everybody.
The only question is which Christian 

3611
02:42:33,331 --> 02:42:37,850
church do you go to the Baptist or the 
presbytarian and you know,

3612
02:42:37,890 --> 02:42:38,723
everyone in his family,
everyone at work is a believer and he's 

3613
02:42:41,521 --> 02:42:42,650
an atheist.
A.

3614
02:42:42,690 --> 02:42:44,850
Okay.
So I haven't faced anything like that,

3615
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:46,440
you know,
and I'm a middle aged white guy,

3616
02:42:46,830 --> 02:42:47,663
you know,
I don't.

3617
02:42:47,730 --> 02:42:49,680
I do have white privileges.
I know.

3618
02:42:50,070 --> 02:42:51,590
Uh,
and so I,

3619
02:42:51,620 --> 02:42:52,453
I am sympathetic to others,
but I do think across the board things 

3620
02:42:55,651 --> 02:42:57,330
are more tolerant.
You know,

3621
02:42:57,331 --> 02:43:00,900
we know this from studies on interracial
marriage,

3622
02:43:00,901 --> 02:43:02,910
for example.
That's not even an issue anymore.

3623
02:43:02,911 --> 02:43:05,250
The gay rights thing has changed very 
rapidly.

3624
02:43:05,251 --> 02:43:06,810
I mean,
that was stunning.

3625
02:43:06,811 --> 02:43:09,570
How quickly social attitudes changed 
after the.

3626
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:11,980
Well,
we have to remember in 2:13,

3627
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:14,590
Hillary Clinton was still saying that 
she didn't believe in gay marriage.

3628
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:16,630
Is there any standout because it was a 
political position.

3629
02:43:16,631 --> 02:43:17,464
That's right now Obama in 2011,
although you never know when a 

3630
02:43:18,971 --> 02:43:21,730
politician says live of course.
Uh,

3631
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:22,690
but now,
uh,

3632
02:43:22,750 --> 02:43:23,710
so I predict,
you know,

3633
02:43:23,711 --> 02:43:24,544
like the gay marriage thing,
this no one will even be talking about 

3634
02:43:26,561 --> 02:43:27,394
it in another year or two.
It'll change so quickly and so across 

3635
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:32,440
the board,
the acceptance now of atheist,

3636
02:43:32,590 --> 02:43:33,860
humanist,
secularists,

3637
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:36,130
agnostics,
whatever is become much,

3638
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:39,350
much better in most places.
They're still set,

3639
02:43:39,380 --> 02:43:40,213
of course,
Islamic countries where not only would 

3640
02:43:42,671 --> 02:43:43,504
they burn me and you,
they'd burned Catholics because they 

3641
02:43:45,761 --> 02:43:48,010
picked the wrong religion.
So there's still that.

3642
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:48,873
But I wonder if there's some improvement
there in those countries because the 

3643
02:43:50,921 --> 02:43:51,754
Internet with younger people when 
they're being exposed to these new 

3644
02:43:53,501 --> 02:43:55,420
ideas,
maybe a,

3645
02:43:55,421 --> 02:43:56,970
I'm not sure on that data.

3646
02:43:57,050 --> 02:44:00,130
The last time I saw a big pole was on,
uh,

3647
02:44:00,190 --> 02:44:03,700
how supportive you would be of Sharia 
Law and these are pretty scary,

3648
02:44:03,701 --> 02:44:04,534
like a third to a half of Muslims living
in Muslim countries that they would 

3649
02:44:07,841 --> 02:44:10,570
support Sharia law.
And if you look at Tria laws,

3650
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:11,691
as you know,
it's,

3651
02:44:11,691 --> 02:44:12,524
it's pretty scary for very anti 
democratic liberal attitudes about 

3652
02:44:17,141 --> 02:44:20,470
rights and women and things like that.
So there,

3653
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:21,513
I think the prediction would be yes,
a millennials and igeneration when they 

3654
02:44:24,821 --> 02:44:28,420
get into power than maybe not just 
political power,

3655
02:44:28,421 --> 02:44:31,210
but like controlling talk shows,
radio shows,

3656
02:44:31,211 --> 02:44:32,200
tv shows,
scripts,

3657
02:44:32,201 --> 02:44:33,430
things like that.
Most,

3658
02:44:33,431 --> 02:44:34,264
I think most moral change happens in 
people's minds from inculcating it from 

3659
02:44:38,141 --> 02:44:41,590
culture pop culture of just how you talk
about other people.

3660
02:44:41,740 --> 02:44:44,530
I'm like,
if Dawkins makes this point that you can

3661
02:44:44,531 --> 02:44:47,410
tell pretty much down to the decade,
uh,

3662
02:44:47,620 --> 02:44:48,453
when a book was written by the way they 
talk about when like a novel talk about 

3663
02:44:51,791 --> 02:44:54,100
women or blacks or whatever going back,
say a century,

3664
02:44:54,101 --> 02:44:54,934
you can say,
well that was 19 thirties the way 

3665
02:44:56,051 --> 02:44:57,160
they're talking about Jews.

3666
02:44:58,510 --> 02:45:01,240
And that's the kind of thing that shifts
very slowly,

3667
02:45:01,270 --> 02:45:04,570
you hardly notice it,
but from people like you comedians,

3668
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:05,703
you tell certain jokes or you say 
certain things and it becomes more 

3669
02:45:07,661 --> 02:45:12,661
acceptable scripts for television shows 
and films and all of us kind of watch it

3670
02:45:13,721 --> 02:45:15,340
and absorb it and just think,
yeah,

3671
02:45:15,341 --> 02:45:16,174
you know,
we shouldn't be saying those kinds of 

3672
02:45:17,171 --> 02:45:19,210
things about women and Jews and blacks 
or whatever.

3673
02:45:19,570 --> 02:45:22,750
Stopped doing that and that consciously 
you just kind of soak it in.

3674
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:24,723
So I think you still need laws.
We have to sometimes change the law and 

3675
02:45:27,671 --> 02:45:28,271
just say,
okay,

3676
02:45:28,271 --> 02:45:31,360
it's now illegal to discriminate against
Jews or whatever.

3677
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:34,450
You can't do that now.
People may still want to do that.

3678
02:45:34,480 --> 02:45:36,250
How do we change their thinking?
Well,

3679
02:45:36,251 --> 02:45:40,300
if that's the bottom of thing that takes
the course of decades or maybe a century

3680
02:45:40,450 --> 02:45:41,283
and it takes generations sometimes 
because the new young kids have to see 

3681
02:45:43,631 --> 02:45:45,990
the flaws in the way their parents are 
thinking and,

3682
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:46,853
and,
and have access to this information and 

3683
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:50,890
form their own opinions on these things.

3684
02:45:50,890 --> 02:45:51,723
Hopefully bakes based on objective 
reasoning and reality and and all the 

3685
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:56,793
awesome stuff that's available now.
My stepdad was in the Pacific war and 

3686
02:46:01,361 --> 02:46:03,240
the way he talked about Japanese,
you know,

3687
02:46:03,380 --> 02:46:07,840
when I was a kid and the 60th and then 
by the time I became an adult,

3688
02:46:07,841 --> 02:46:08,650
I'm like,
Dad,

3689
02:46:08,650 --> 02:46:10,310
you don't,
don't say the stuff.

3690
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:13,970
Don't say it out loud.
And think about 1947 to 1960.

3691
02:46:13,971 --> 02:46:16,130
That's a tiny period of time.
Right?

3692
02:46:16,250 --> 02:46:17,440
It's so sure.
Yeah.

3693
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:19,370
I mean that's really like,
you know,

3694
02:46:19,371 --> 02:46:21,260
when we're talking about the early two 
thousands,

3695
02:46:21,380 --> 02:46:23,540
right?
Imagine if World War Two happened during

3696
02:46:23,541 --> 02:46:25,620
the early two thousands.
Yeah.

3697
02:46:25,990 --> 02:46:26,631
Yeah.
It's hard.

3698
02:46:26,631 --> 02:46:30,290
It's hard to remember.
It's hard to put it into perspective.

3699
02:46:30,530 --> 02:46:32,330
I think pop culture,
the media,

3700
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:35,540
social media and so on is,
is going to accelerate moral progress.

3701
02:46:35,541 --> 02:46:36,374
It'll happen faster.
Like it happened faster for women than 

3702
02:46:38,481 --> 02:46:39,380
it did for blacks.

3703
02:46:39,380 --> 02:46:41,570
It happened faster for gays and it did 
for women,

3704
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:43,033
you know,
maybe whatever's next animal rights or 

3705
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:46,940
something like this will accelerate even
more.

3706
02:46:46,950 --> 02:46:47,783
Maybe trans rights or something about 
the push back against this idea that we 

3707
02:46:51,111 --> 02:46:54,290
are living in the safest time ever and 
that there is an absolute trend,

3708
02:46:54,291 --> 02:46:57,080
like pinker gets criticized about this 
where people say,

3709
02:46:57,081 --> 02:46:57,914
no,
the world is still not safe for these 

3710
02:46:59,181 --> 02:47:00,014
people,
for this,

3711
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:01,640
for this group,
for that group,

3712
02:47:01,641 --> 02:47:05,470
and for you saying that the world is,
it just shows your white privilege,

3713
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:10,070
white male perspective and I'm on board 
with,

3714
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:12,080
with Steve All across the board on these
things.

3715
02:47:12,081 --> 02:47:12,914
He's got the data.
It depends on the question you're 

3716
02:47:14,661 --> 02:47:15,500
asking.
You know,

3717
02:47:15,501 --> 02:47:17,150
it's like if you say,
yeah,

3718
02:47:17,151 --> 02:47:18,840
but my life is not better.
Okay,

3719
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:20,780
we're not talking about your life.
The question is,

3720
02:47:20,781 --> 02:47:22,370
is society getting better?

3721
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:24,590
Okay.
Of course there's ups and downs and this

3722
02:47:24,591 --> 02:47:27,050
group is doing better than that group 
and yes,

3723
02:47:27,051 --> 02:47:29,150
there's still some racial discrimination
and yes,

3724
02:47:29,151 --> 02:47:32,120
there's still clearly antisemites as 
we've seen recently,

3725
02:47:33,170 --> 02:47:36,320
but across the board,
if you take like the last 200 years,

3726
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:38,750
which direction are the trend lines 
going?

3727
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:40,220
They're all going in the right 
direction.

3728
02:47:41,150 --> 02:47:42,350
So again,
its scale.

3729
02:47:42,351 --> 02:47:44,420
The question is what's the scale we're 
talking about?

3730
02:47:44,480 --> 02:47:46,850
So it's,
it's a little unfair to pinker to say,

3731
02:47:46,851 --> 02:47:48,710
well,
you're blind to that thing over.

3732
02:47:48,750 --> 02:47:50,710
He's not talking about that one thing 
there.

3733
02:47:50,940 --> 02:47:52,670
He's talking about just across the 
board.

3734
02:47:53,090 --> 02:47:53,930
Yeah,
I agree.

3735
02:47:54,980 --> 02:47:56,840
Listen man,
thanks for everything.

3736
02:47:56,870 --> 02:47:59,630
Thanks for everything you do.
Thanks for all your articles saying that

3737
02:47:59,631 --> 02:48:02,990
books and thanks for coming on here.
And please let people know.

3738
02:48:03,050 --> 02:48:05,810
Your podcast once again is called 
skeptics,

3739
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:07,280
Alon Science,
science,

3740
02:48:07,850 --> 02:48:08,683
science along.
He just got a skeptic dicom and it's 

3741
02:48:09,891 --> 02:48:10,724
posted there and yeah,
so skeptic is still going and social 

3742
02:48:13,941 --> 02:48:17,420
media at Michael.
Shermer is my twitter feed.

3743
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:20,480
You have instagram as well?
I don't do that.

3744
02:48:20,570 --> 02:48:23,450
How dare you?
That's Michael Shermer one.

3745
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:25,930
Oh,
do you have an idea?

3746
02:48:26,030 --> 02:48:28,060
I'm going to start posting as of today.
Okay.

3747
02:48:28,061 --> 02:48:29,050
I will.
Oh yeah,

3748
02:48:29,070 --> 02:48:29,903
take a photo.
I always click on yours because you 

3749
02:48:31,521 --> 02:48:33,830
always have interesting photographs from
wherever you're at.

3750
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:35,460
And it's funny.
It is kind of fun.

3751
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:38,630
It's just take an extra minute or two.
Giant waste of time now.

3752
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:39,853
Don't get sucked down.
I'm already wasting so much time on 

3753
02:48:41,661 --> 02:48:42,800
twitter.
Well thank you Michael.

3754
02:48:42,801 --> 02:48:44,120
Appreciate it man.
Thanks for having me.
