00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:03,901
So if you start,

3
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,520
if you take a guitar string and
you split it into four equal parts,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,560
you put your finger over a one quarter
of the string and then you start just hug

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,750
plucking the string and hovering above
the string so you don't actually push it

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,620
to the fret board.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,100
Those notes occur naturally
as the harmonics and the
expansion of the vibrating

8
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,394
string.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,940
So that those notes were not
really chosen by Roy Orbison.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,140
Whoever wrote the song,

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,420
they were really chosen
by like a four gay series.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,400
Um,

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,670
and it feels like it's a riff,

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,980
but I discovered this when
I was in Indonesia as I
would start playing that and

15
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:41,880
people would react.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,510
I thought like,

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,343
why that song?

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,620
What about more complex creative and
sort of improvisational song like Voodoo

19
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,160
child from Hendrix?

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,990
So I don't know about Voodoo child and

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,190
I'm following along,

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,093
you know,

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,310
I mean,

24
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,740
well take taking out and it changes up.

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,540
So if you look at the first
couple of cords of red house,

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,540
there's like some seventh
or diminished chord.

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,960
Like he's Pegi Nana,

28
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,800
and then he moves it down a half step,

29
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,500
which has to do with this
tritone substitution and
the symmetry inside of the

30
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,490
seventh chord.

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,400
So if I recall correctly,

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,940
you have a chord like c e g B flat would
be a c seven chord and the e and the B

33
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:34,170
flat would form this
thing called a tri tone.

34
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,690
And now if you went in the blues,

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:37,530
you,

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,680
there are three elements
of the chord progression,

37
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,240
the dominant subdominant and the tonic.

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,880
If you go down a half step,

39
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,160
you effectively invert the
third and the flat seventh.

40
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:50,950
Uh,

41
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,040
so if you go one half step below that,

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,270
it's the flat seventh and the third
I think of the subdominant court.

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,280
So Hendricks is actually playing
with math in something as basic as,

44
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,700
do you think he's aware of it or do
you think he's doing it sort of just

45
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:06,660
instinctual?

46
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,140
Well,

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,771
first of all,

48
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,140
when you're visited by
an alien intelligence,

49
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:11,220
we went through cuddle fish and we,

50
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,540
now we've gotten the Jimi Hendrix.

51
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,140
So yeah,

52
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,973
that's like,

53
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,730
these are the,

54
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,680
these are the best
alien sightings we have.

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,350
It's very hard to speculate,

56
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:19,770
but I,

57
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,603
I,

58
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,410
I just look at everything I've been able
to understand about what he did and you

59
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:26,521
know,

60
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,160
you're dealing with the
supermind as well as an intuitive

61
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,760
mastery of the instrument.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Complete understanding of the chords
and progressions and just the ability to

63
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,360
improvise and to make it sound different.

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,170
Adding the Wah Wah pedal and all that
distortion and all this shit that he used

65
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:43,381
to do.

66
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:46,230
And the fact that he
imparts more into one note,

67
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,000
like I wouldn't even know how to notate.

68
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,880
I mean what does even the
instrument and play the guitar,

69
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,390
he played the guitar amplification,

70
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,470
you know,

71
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,900
signal processing system as a whole.

72
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,170
So,

73
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,040
you know,

74
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,520
there are these people who are just
in some multidimensional space.

75
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,870
Another one of my favorites is,

76
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,630
uh,

77
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,630
a guy named Roy Buchanan who some have
these guys who understand the harmonics

78
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,370
of gravitate to telecasters and um,

79
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,761
you know,

80
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:20,761
pull up song called Roy's blues and
watch him just go into the multiverse and

81
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:25,660
start playing with things that you
can't even imagine are possible.

82
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,230
So I do think that there is a very close
relationship between algorithms and

83
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,214
emotion.

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,300
Wait,

85
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,170
but wait,

86
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,550
Harvey,

87
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,910
he was the guy that would
give girls the shoulder rubs.

88
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,440
He would tell them to massage him.

89
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,311
Oh,

90
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,810
he massaged them.

91
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,250
They would massage him.

92
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,140
He would do according to these girls.

93
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:47,891
I don't know if it's true,

94
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,160
but he'd be the guy that would be,

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,113
I'll be right back.

96
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,580
And he comes back in a bathrobe.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,080
He's a bathrobe guy.

98
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,510
Here's the thing.

99
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,510
I don't mean to make light of anybody's
sexual assault or whatever it was or

100
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,510
harassment,

101
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,620
but other working on the roof.

102
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,040
Again,

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,790
wonderful.

104
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,100
But,

105
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,933
but what I,

106
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,950
but here's the thing.

107
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,120
How many women said yes,

108
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,280
that will be a fuck load.

109
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,390
Like that was his move.

110
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,000
What we're seeing is his missed pitches,

111
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,320
right?

112
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,560
He hit by a lot of fucking
triples and home runs,

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
knocked a lot of balls out of the park,

114
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,330
but occasionally he was
wiffen occasionally.

115
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,141
He was like,

116
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,640
I got this one in the bag boys.

117
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,390
And she's like,

118
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,500
fuck off you pig.

119
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,131
And he's like,

120
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:27,401
oh,

121
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:27,701
come on.

122
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,570
Just come back to my room.

123
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,761
No,

124
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:28,871
no,

125
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:29,081
no.

126
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,170
It's like shit down.

127
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,200
What happened Harvey?

128
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,480
Oh,

129
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,280
just wasn't connecting.

130
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,114
I wasn't connecting.

131
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,601
But listen,

132
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,071
I got all this,

133
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:39,800
those as a girl wants to be in the next
fucking this movie and Avatar 16 and

134
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,060
she's willing to do the
thing to get the part.

135
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,820
And that's kind of like that guys,

136
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,010
they can get the part and get
your money and get on with it.

137
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:53,011
How many girls read the story when it
broke and could still taste the asparagus,

138
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,620
caviar flavored come just the
cocaine and VOD color in his loads.

139
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,890
I bet he has like a Flemmi
like Moan when he comes.

140
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,980
He's a Kinda guy

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,560
spittle and the corners of his,

142
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,960
now let's try to hit on you.

143
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,560
He's got a little bit bubble are his lip.

144
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,893
He's nasty.

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,410
That's a gluttonous man control.

146
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,340
It's not attractive.

147
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,653
It's definitely not.

148
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,530
My favorite too is that
he would jerk off into,

149
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,201
did you hear this?

150
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,040
But he plants

151
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,400
his green.

152
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,380
He wants to exist off of his loads.

153
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,210
That's such a desperate thing.

154
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:43,680
Like on,

155
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,230
can we get it?

156
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,741
Can I have it?

157
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,070
No.

158
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,311
Okay,

159
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,180
stay here then let me,

160
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,431
you know,

161
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:49,630
like it's so maybe it was hoping
they would just dive in the grade

162
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,530
of a soldier,

163
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,130
but I also like,

164
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,973
I was thinking too,

165
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,560
I've,

166
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,400
I've seen so many dudes jerking
off in public like homeless guys.

167
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:01,850
Yeah.

168
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,260
I never got anything for it.

169
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,250
Is it,

170
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,083
you know,

171
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,350
good point.

172
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,183
Yeah.

173
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,180
It's so much better to do it in a class.

174
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,020
Oh,

175
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,853
it holds you accountable.

176
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,130
Yeah.

177
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,500
It holds you accountable and it's flooded.

178
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,430
There's no bullshit.

179
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,090
[inaudible] this is going to be unit
fucking to hold this pose for 30 seconds

180
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:20,870
period.

181
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,130
This is 30 seconds,

182
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,821
you know,

183
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:26,270
and you do it as much as you can
and your fucking feet are shaking.

184
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,980
And my favorite one,

185
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,290
my favorite one is this one.

186
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,720
Oh yeah.

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,050
You go down here and you have to sit here.

188
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,440
Yeah.

189
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
I love that fucking post.

190
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,070
That's what I love that one
because I was a catcher,

191
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,001
so it's like,

192
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,520
it goes right back to my strength
because I don't want to work.

193
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,140
I love that fucking post.

194
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,380
I go deep when,

195
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,280
when she goes out I go deep
and that and the plain one.

196
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:46,491
Where are you?

197
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:46,760
Come on.

198
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,480
Good one.

199
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,990
Tom and I,

200
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,850
Tom and I had been talking
about doing a calendar,

201
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,940
a Yoga [inaudible] Yoga
calendar of 12 months.

202
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,530
Me and Tom and different poses together,

203
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:55,650
all this shit up thing.

204
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,410
You would sell the shit out of that thing.

205
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,690
That's a great idea.

206
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,051
Jamie.

207
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,670
You would take different photography.

208
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,370
A couple of couples
poses down by the beach.

209
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,370
Yeah,

210
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,980
that's not what we're talking about Jamie.

211
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,570
We want to do a Bikram hot,

212
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,404
sweaty,

213
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:09,860
uh,

214
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,420
maybe both of us in speedos.

215
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh yeah.

216
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,411
And,

217
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:12,770
and,

218
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,210
and hold our favorite poses.

219
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,700
Where you to get those jeans shorts.

220
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,330
I'd wear those in a heartbeat.

221
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,510
The Shyness Eg.

222
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,730
The second we went in,

223
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,810
the first cost we went in,

224
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,831
Tom Goes,

225
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,220
uh,

226
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,140
he sees a guy in the speed own.

227
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,361
He goes,

228
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,380
how are you not wearing a speedo?

229
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,281
He's like,

230
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,210
this is your whole thing.

231
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,661
And I was like,

232
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,494
I don't know.

233
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,660
My favorite Tommy Bond story in Yoga
or instructor starts telling a story,

234
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,081
you know,

235
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:34,640
like in between poses.

236
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:38,660
He's telling a story and like the first
30 minutes of class about his son and

237
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:43,661
him in New York and his son walking and
his son being out of breath and whatnot,

238
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,070
and then continues on with the poses.

239
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,650
Last 30 minutes of class,

240
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,120
we are fucking panting.

241
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,860
We're on our stomachs.

242
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,030
Face to the left,

243
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,650
hands down by your side.

244
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,010
And I hear t in a silent
class or your Tom go,

245
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,323
hey man.

246
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,351
Hey,

247
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:00,951
what happened?

248
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,360
And he's just talking loud as shit.

249
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,660
Scared the fuck out of me because what
happened with you and your son in New

250
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,493
York?

251
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,121
The guy goes,

252
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:09,780
excuse me guys.

253
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,111
Tommy was,

254
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,040
you never put your story,

255
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:11,221
man.

256
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,960
I've been waiting for
this end of the story.

257
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,310
And you just kept dragging on and like,

258
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:17,670
and he keeps talking and I
am in shaking Mexico going,

259
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,930
shut the fuck up Tom.

260
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,100
Fucking yoga.

261
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:22,810
It does.

262
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,040
The guy finished and then the guy goes,

263
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:24,191
uh,

264
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:24,851
that was it.

265
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,684
And Tom Goes,

266
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,330
oh,

267
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,163
okay.

268
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,603
Oh

269
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,360
yeah.
