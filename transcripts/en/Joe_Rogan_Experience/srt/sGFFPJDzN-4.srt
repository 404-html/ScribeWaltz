1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,040
Keep it together. Keep it together
so hard to keep it together.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,680
We just got to keep it together.
It's so important to keep it together.

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:12,990
I know it's hard as fuck
to keep it together,

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,790
but key pay together.
Before we get started,

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,780
we've got some shows coming up.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,170
Brian Red Band and Tony Hinchcliffe
or making them wait Serrano.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,860
Be careful up there. He fucks cause
that's Canada or I design America.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,730
He's gotta be respectful.
Don't go up there.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,420
Thrown your fucking waste products
in the street. Be Kind, be gentle.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,790
Canadians are awesome.
You're gonna love Toronto.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,070
Toronto.
Very different than a Vancouver.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,300
Yeah, I think, uh, well
they're both awesome. You know,

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,150
cannabis,
like one of my favorite places to perform.

14
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,170
I'm doing a Winnipeg this weekend.
Wow, that's awesome. It's fucking,

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,590
they're strong. They're so fun.
They're, they're like, they're like,

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,010
just like regular, like American crowds,
like a really good American crowd.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,760
Jazz that up like 5%.
That's like a really good Canadian crowd.

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,220
They're like super enthusiastic.
They're awesome. Sweet.

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,260
And that place that you're
going to in Toronto,

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,910
they may or may not smoke marijuana while
the show was going on underground cafe

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,080
and you may or may not not be able to
see people in the audience because you're

22
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:13,790
performing in the fucking clouds.

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,560
I heard that.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,310
I think it was Esther or somebody went
there and they don't smoke weed and they

25
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,040
said that they got so stoned that they
was having a panic attack while just

26
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:21,900
doing comedy there.

27
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,170
Absolutely no doubt. 100% the,
there was no air left in that room.

28
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,750
You were only breathing we'd wow.
It was insane.

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,460
I had never been so high in my life.
There was no way or they,

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,340
there was nowhere else to go. I'd hit
the back of the high wall like, Oh,

31
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:40,990
here we are. It's like this is
the wall. This is the 300 foot or

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,160
I'm not going to, I'm not going to do
good. I, this is going to be scary for me.

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,830
I'm not going to be fine. Just don't
get too high before you go up there.

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,400
That's the thing. Just don't get too
high before you go up there. Wow.

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,490
Or do it get high like
really early in the day.

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,220
So you're comfortable around like five,
six o'clock.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,110
You better build up your tolerance.
Yeah.

38
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:02,490
Go over your notes or just stay
with the stone is set everywhere.

39
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:06,690
I'm just making words a great though.
Great. You're doing three days up there.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,380
July 11th to 12th and 13th.
It's a great spot.

41
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,370
The people that run it are super cool.
All that stuff about weed. I made that up.

42
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,140
It's not even going on down there. I
don't worry about it. Uh, but it's a,

43
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,660
you're going to love it.
And Tony Hinchcliffe we've taken with you.

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,160
It's fucking hilarious.
Really Funny Dude. He's a,

45
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,460
he's really coming up.
We started that new podcast with him,

46
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,850
the Hinch piff notes and man,
we've only done two episodes,

47
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:37,050
but I really see this becoming big.
It's like, if you know what it's like,

48
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,290
it's like American idol
for, uh, open makers. Yeah.

49
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,810
You're doing some weird shit with him.
Tell me what exactly what you're doing.

50
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:46,290
What we do is we have a show
and like whoever does they,

51
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,370
the comedy store has this sign up sheet
where like every Sunday or Monday you

52
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,350
sign up to try to do three minutes on
stage and there's tons of people that,

53
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,060
you know,
it's pay $20 parking.

54
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:01,180
They try to just get there three minutes
standup in and they don't get on.

55
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,930
So we take those people that like the
people that didn't make the standup and we

56
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,500
let them sign up on this list and then
they get to do one minute in front of me,

57
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,240
Tony and whoever the special
guests for the week is.

58
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,080
And then we pretty much either do
this thing called tag it or Faggot,

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,160
but spelled with a Ph. Uh, but we
changed it to valid. That's really rude.

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
No thought for your very first time

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,820
tagged with the p h a g thing.

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,080
That's like the whichever career
I think limit first of all guests.

63
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,280
You named that. Right.
Okay. And uh, second of all,

64
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:34,070
you didn't run it by any
gay friends first? No. No,

65
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:37,250
but we changed it this week to bag it.
Just because everyone got nervous.

66
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,900
It's unnecessary in this day and age.
Fag is unnecessary.

67
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,770
It's too bad cause it was cause it
was awesome. We got to let that go.

68
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,860
You know why we've got to let it go.
We got to let it go.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,420
Sort of in unity to our gay friends
cause we don't really give a fuck if

70
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:56,350
someone's gay. I mean we really
don't. So like if you're,

71
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,330
you're saying like something homophobic
just cause it's cute and fun to do.

72
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,510
If you really don't care if someone's gay,
it's like you,

73
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:05,000
you're doing yourself like
a little bit of the service.

74
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,040
You're getting lumped in with
something that you don't agree with.

75
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,670
It's absolutely a, a poop joke. You
know, I'd, it's like a cheesy dumb joke,

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,960
you know,
you would say in high school.

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,200
So we changed it to bag it but last night
and what we do is we pretty much sit

78
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,270
there and they do their joke and
then we either help them like,

79
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,670
like that's a good joke. Right?
You know, here's some tags for it.

80
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:23,700
We try to tag it up for him or we just
tell them to bag it and get to get the

81
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:26,940
fuck out of area. And we kind of like
almost do it in like a roast kind of way.

82
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,480
But like last night we were there
and this guy came up and he's like,

83
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,200
and he was dressed up as iron man and
he was just came up to us and goes,

84
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:38,130
I'm a huge dose squad fan and I wanted
to come here and show and hang out with

85
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:41,460
you guys.
So He's our nut now our new security guy.

86
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,540
Like I like getting the people off stage.

87
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,770
It's not a fucking outfit. Yeah. First
of all, he's like part Ironman Park.

88
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,520
Captain America. Yeah. Look,

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,840
it has a microphone thing in it that's
out into battle against anyone who would

90
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:56,840
threaten our way of life.
All mine.

91
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,510
God, it was so ridiculous having
him on board because he was,

92
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,810
he ended up being really funny too.
So like he would like, you know,

93
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,610
give him chime in on some of the comics,
but it's,

94
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,720
it's the first episode drops
this week, uh, on iTunes

95
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,110
can go to get death squad.tv
and you can find the, uh,

96
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,510
how to get tickets for
the Toronto Gig. Yeah. Uh,

97
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,330
we're also brought to you by hover. If
you go to hover.com, forward slash Rogan,

98
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:24,440
you will save 10% off your domain name.
Registrations.

99
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,850
Hover is a accompany the d domain name
registration company that's owned by the

100
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:33,230
same people that own ting. And uh,
they sort of take the same approach,

101
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,470
try not to repeat block,
try to provide a very good service,

102
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:39,440
tried to make it easy to use and hovers.
Super easy to use.

103
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:43,010
I've used it myself to register
websites and um, their,

104
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,860
their user interface is very intuitive.
It's super easy.

105
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm not that technical when it comes to
the Internet. I'm not like that. Like, um,

106
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,020
I'm not that proficient. I fuck up a lot
of feel like I'm always calling Brian.

107
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,600
It's like, what am I doing? What's wrong?
Like, what's wrong with my fucking phone?

108
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,130
What's wrong with it?
I, I don't, I don't know

109
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,600
that much. So if I can do it and
do it easily, it's not hard to do.

110
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,570
And they offer three
free things like free,

111
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,600
who is domain name privacy so that
if you have some disgusting website,

112
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,310
if you're some sick freak that
likes to beat off on feet,

113
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,970
there's nothing wrong with that man.
You know as long as it looks.

114
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:21,120
Some people like it. I bet. I bet they
do. Some people don't need to make a bed.

115
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,520
People like fat phones through their
noses and people like all kinds of crazy

116
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:29,510
shit. People like tattoo on their
face. People like crazy shit. Okay,

117
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,373
you can't hate,

118
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,360
but I don't think I should have
to know who owns that website.

119
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,540
And I don't think people should have
to know that you're a closet freak.

120
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,370
So you can have who is domain
name privacy for free with hover.

121
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,800
It's a cool company.
Go check it out.

122
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,830
hover.com forward slash Rogen and
save yourself some money because

123
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,540
that's my song. Boom son, go to hover.

124
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,480
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com and what a shock because the

125
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:02,420
fucking CEO of on and is here today.
Ladies and gentlemen,

126
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,650
International World Traveler,
psychedelic explorer, huge cock.

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,140
That's what I hear. Well, well
easy, easy. There is no need to,

128
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,390
huge is a rude word except when I do a
Bogo then it shrinks to the density of

129
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,960
Pluto and a small diamond,
but it's t pressing his dick hole.

130
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,460
How dare you.
I don't think that be effective.

131
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,740
Maybe it would imagine if you found
that was the best way to do it,

132
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,300
just pack it in there like a musket

133
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,290
tastes like watermelon.
If you could get it like,

134
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,460
because there's some drugs that people
do take Ainsley and they actually enjoy

135
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,520
it. Like there's a girl named
neuro soup and she did a,

136
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:46,700
a a piece on youtube where
she was talking about,

137
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,850
it's kind of like a billion hits
because she's talking about taking Dmt,

138
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:53,120
Anal Lee, that she took DMT
and she put it in her ass.

139
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,520
And she was one that
was in that vice story,

140
00:07:55,521 --> 00:08:00,050
that Hamilton Morris vice story where he
was talking about how her boyfriend was

141
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:03,620
his gigantic cocaine dealer,
an ecstasy dealer.

142
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,320
Wednesday, your Hamilton
Morris and version was
balling. That's his real voice,

143
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,370
man.
Don't hate.

144
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,090
But this chick that had this greatly
detailed vivid video about her putting,

145
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,760
um,

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,560
DMT in her ass and it was just fucking
super intense ride with the devil.

147
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,480
Yeah, I went to have watch somebody
go somebody into your bloodstream.

148
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,720
My parents talking to aliens that an
electronic music conference and I do not

149
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,120
endorse or recommend
this behavior whatsoever,

150
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:36,800
but I watched the girl who said she
couldn't get high from ecstasy anymore.

151
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,040
She takes one and she puts one in her
mouth and goes under her little Tutu and

152
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:47,180
puts one in her ass at the same time. And
it's like, I hope this works. Oh my God,

153
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:51,490
I hope this works. Did she at least break
it up before she wrote in her answer?

154
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:56,491
She crunched down with their butt and
try to slowly it into a fine powder,

155
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,850
dissolving it with the
natural juice and what? Yeah.

156
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,560
Why wouldn't you start
with your vagina first?

157
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:05,310
Cause it's definitely easier to get
juicy in there if you just found out that

158
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,090
you think you're an asshole and brain
best thing ever for cracking wallets like

159
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,550
you like this. No Way. My ass
has no strength. There's no,

160
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,910
but really you put a wall,

161
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,630
nothing in there and it just
destroys it and you're like, wow.

162
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,370
Have you ever tried to squeeze it on your
finger? No. No stick things in my ass,

163
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,290
but a doctor did.
Once I got,

164
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,830
I had a test once in a doctor looked up
my ass with his finger. I'm like, wow,

165
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,780
I've thought a colonic and that's
a little frightening. Yeah,

166
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,900
that seems like a bad idea,
right?

167
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,430
He had a stick a pump up up your stomach
and you're going to shoot water in

168
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:37,530
there and clean yourself out.
Including all the good stuff.

169
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,210
Like there's a whole civilization going
on inside your stomach. It's true.

170
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,030
And you're going to
blast water through your,

171
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,090
your shit hole and then they're gonna
examine your poop and you're going to

172
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:49,390
discuss what your diet is. Whoa, watch
it. Go through the tube, see salad.

173
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,310
But you said excavating.
It's like archeology, you
know, you see stratosphere,

174
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,850
like layers of the earth dude,
I different meals past years past,

175
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:01,160
you know you got the red layer, the
brown layer, the chain breaks off.

176
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,540
Just different parts that you see from
not just your last meal but many meals

177
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,850
before, how often you need to do it. But
that's what I saw going through the two.

178
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,310
Did you feel good after he did it?
The very first one I did.

179
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,050
I've done like a three or so.
The very first week.

180
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,270
It's a good excuse.
No,

181
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,230
the very first one I did
felt like a slight religious
experiences. Like amazing.

182
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,620
Like I walked out of there like feeling
light and like I was cleanse and then

183
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:36,540
the other ones were mostly
just uncomfortable and I
didn't really notice very

184
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:41,541
much reward leading me to believe that
colonics are good like once every five to

185
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:46,080
10 years or so just to kind of in case
there's some shit hiding out in some

186
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:50,610
nooks and crannies cause the digestive
tract as all these little spots and nooks

187
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:54,630
and crannies and little areas where waste
can collect and start actually really

188
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,080
rotting,
coming septic.

189
00:10:56,081 --> 00:11:00,270
So it's good to get that out of there
every once in a while. That's my theory.

190
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm just see bullshit on at Penn and
teller bullshit. What'd they say?

191
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,430
What'd they say? They pretty much just
went to all these doctors and like,

192
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,181
and you know,

193
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:09,390
had they got this guy on Craig's list
that was broken in the aid that you gave

194
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:14,370
him for like $300 to do it and
let them film it. Oh my God,

195
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,090
this poor guy. So then they went, all
the doctors and their doctors are like,

196
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,140
that's, it doesn't, nothing.

197
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,020
That seems silly.
There seemed to be not paying attention

198
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,020
and they let you watch it. Maybe that's
the next product we'll go with on it.

199
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,850
On a colonic. Colonics and
douchebags actual literal dude.

200
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
Apparently I'm a lot.

201
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:42,480
There's people that will take a Epsom
salts and they drink it in a glass,

202
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:46,320
like a couple tablespoons.
Does that go through you like rocket fuel?

203
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,680
That's what I've heard. I've heard
it's just really uncomfortable. Gassy,

204
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,800
uncomfortable, very diuretic.
Don't rely on that either.

205
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,120
But is it to have a benefit?
Is there something to clean
your shit hole out? Yeah,

206
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:59,490
I mean if you're doing a
cleanse right and you need to,

207
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,940
you need to open up the channels.

208
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,210
Have you talked to be doing a cleanse
is chances are you're a douchebag if

209
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,660
you're one of those fucking
guys and cleansing, cleansing.

210
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,550
I'm getting very feminine cleansing.
Yeah.

211
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,710
But if you are doing some kind of fast
or some kind of protocol where you are

212
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,490
trying to detoxify your body, it's good
to open up the channels of elimination.

213
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,510
One of the channels of elimination is
shit. Right? So it's good to actually,

214
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:25,180
cause you will get kind of constipated
because you're not feeding your body with

215
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,970
a bunch of food.
So it's good to actually push that out.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But usually better than Epsom salt
is going to be oxygenated magnesium.

217
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:38,200
There's a couple of brands like mango
seven, um, and that ozonated magnesium.

218
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,280
There's a couple of different types,

219
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:44,140
but it'll actually help really push
that through with a kind of a good,

220
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,030
does the absence salts contain
magnesium? It does, right?

221
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,660
Maybe that is the mechanism perhaps you
thought to, yeah, because different form,

222
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,840
one of the benefits of the tank is that
you absorb Epson salts or your skin.

223
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,840
So the fact that you don't have
a tank I'm going to, right.

224
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,630
We've got to get you on that shit.
That's correct. At this point.

225
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,550
That's preposterous. A
great, uh, magnesiums like
the thing that we all need,

226
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:11,080
what we, none of us really get
enough of. Yeah. Magnesium,

227
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,810
zinc and magnesium. Yeah. A little
lot of minerals. Actually. The,

228
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,500
remember that guy that was around dead
doctors don't lie. And he was, uh,

229
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,600
explaining like cheerleaded minerals and
he was saying that mineral deficiencies,

230
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:27,800
the reason for like all these issues in
farm animals that we fixed a long time

231
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:31,700
ago, cause we just give the mineral rich
diets and we add minerals to their food.

232
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,130
But we don't add, I'll add minerals to
people's food. He's like, do you know,

233
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,840
few people take mineral supplements?

234
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,000
And he was like talking about
all these different deficiencies,

235
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:42,230
calcium treating osteoporosis.
And it was pretty fucking crazy shit

236
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,900
convincing because there's not
as much mineral in the soil.

237
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:47,900
I mean they're replanting over
and over again in the same fields.

238
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,270
And that's where I, vegetables are
coming from constantly replanting.

239
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:53,210
So the minerals in the soil
are mostly from the fertilizer.

240
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,630
What they're actually putting in,
well,

241
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,390
they're not necessarily
putting in complete full
spectrum balanced minerals back

242
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:00,120
in the soil.
So the,

243
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,700
a lot of the food we eat don't have the
mineral content that we originally had

244
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:08,690
if you were farming in a
really sustainable way and
rotating around getting new

245
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:13,280
soil and things like that solution.
Now easiest one is the Himalayan salt,

246
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,570
84 trace minerals right there and
the salt. And that's, you know,

247
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:22,070
one of the reasons why salt was so prized
back in ancient times is that that's

248
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,500
the best source for your mineral.
The easiest source at least.

249
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:25,460
There's a lot of good sources,

250
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,450
but this is a really good reason to
forgetting Himalayan salt, right?

251
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:32,890
Because that's like it's salt that hasn't
reached any, there's been no pollution,

252
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:33,350
I'd say.

253
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah,
it's like a hundred million years old.

254
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,870
So all of the pollution that's in the
world now, everything that's in the air,

255
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:42,620
everything that's in the water and the
fish and all that shit that wasn't around

256
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:43,880
back a hundred million years ago.

257
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,910
Just Tara doctorals and some ancestors
roaming around on the ground.

258
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:53,060
So there was nothing to pollute the salt
at all. No oil spills, none of that.

259
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,630
So it's a very pristine deposit.
That's fine.

260
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,240
You put like a little in your water in
the morning. Yeah, I do it intermittently.

261
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,740
I actually like it at night and I was,
I had a pretty dramatic incident where I,

262
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,830
for like a week I started going through,
I was uh,

263
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,200
I was taking very demineralized water,

264
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,230
like highly filtered water just
cause it's a water filter that out.

265
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,120
So then I was starting to hear my pulse
in my ears when I would go to sleep and

266
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,950
I was having trouble
sleeping and they're like,

267
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,370
well it could be a mineral deficiency
for your adrenal glands. And I was like,

268
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,480
okay. He's like, yeah, they're like, take
a bunch of salt before you go to bed,

269
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:30,830
Himalayan salt before you go to bed.
I did that and made a dramatic difference.

270
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:31,970
So now for me,

271
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,980
I take more salt at night before I go
to bed and I sleep a lot better and I

272
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:40,490
don't get that. It wasn't
so much that I was, it just,

273
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:43,880
I could hear my pulse in my yeah,
years and I felt like a real deficiency.

274
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:47,720
What would cause that? Did they explain
the mechanism has a mineral deficiency.

275
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,670
The adrenal glands need,
you know,

276
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:52,100
need the minerals to
function at an optimal level.

277
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:56,270
Like most of the systems in our body.
So all kinds of systems need the minerals.

278
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:59,300
Minerals are kind of the
foundation of what makes us up,

279
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:02,300
makes everything run really well.
So were you drinking distilled water?

280
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,430
Is that what highly highly
distilled water Kangen water,

281
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,770
it's called Kangen water.
It's just happened to the filter.

282
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,680
Completely mineral devoid
water at my house, you know,

283
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,360
and I was eating good
vegetables and stuff,

284
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:17,000
but the vegetables don't have
all of those minerals. And I was,

285
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,520
I would occasionally
sprinkle salt on my food,

286
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,970
but I wasn't really paying attention
to my salt intake, you know?

287
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:27,650
And then I tried to regiment
it and actually supplementally
take it and it made

288
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:31,010
a huge impact for me. Wow. Yeah. Cause
you have to be careful with that.

289
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,680
I mean all these water systems,
I mean this is a fancy water system.

290
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:37,220
I'm not endorsing it by any means.
It's just good to take everything out.

291
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,570
But it takes too much out.

292
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,260
You have absolutely no minerals and
electrolytes in your water if you're using

293
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,090
one of these highly filtered system.

294
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:48,790
So adding a pinch of that salt back in
is going to be important because that's

295
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,280
your body runs on. That's interesting
too. But what about like, um, springwater?

296
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,550
Is that the best water to get a new body?

297
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,250
Like there's a difference between spring
water and like what is the difference

298
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,440
between a spring one and
like Disani and all those,

299
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,780
like those are filtered waters,
right? Right. So that's,

300
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:04,910
they're basically taking
water from anywhere.

301
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:08,360
It can be as dirty as can be and
they're just running it through adequate

302
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,690
filters to take the bad shit out of it.
And that's distilled,

303
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:12,680
that's filtered water.

304
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,490
Now springwater is actually
filtered either through the ground,

305
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:17,570
which is the best way to do it.

306
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:22,130
Like a volcanic system where the water
naturally filters to the lava that comes

307
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:22,700
out.

308
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,360
And that's going to collect all the
minerals through the earth that you really

309
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,400
need. And that's going to be
the best way to do it. Yeah.

310
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:32,300
My friend's place in Colorado has
a a, well yeah, and she gets it.

311
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,620
She gets it like right from the, well,
it's incredible. It's like spring water.

312
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,700
Totally.
So like you've free springwater,

313
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,990
so you probably need half the Himalayan
salt or a quarter or maybe you don't

314
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:44,060
need any,
I don't even know how rich that water is,

315
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:47,570
but you'll need way less than if you're
constantly drinking filtered distilled

316
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,190
water. Yeah. They pull water
right out of the fucking ground

317
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,040
up there, man. It's nuts. I mean that's
where they're getting their water.

318
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,330
They're getting free springwater,

319
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:58,290
just pulling it out of the ground just
like drank tragic. I get some water here.

320
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,510
Yeah. You know, try it. Should I
go into studio city? Dig it up.

321
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:04,620
Fuck at a hole in the ground and Fido,
not going to be good.

322
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,510
Suck it out with a straw.
You're dead.

323
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,200
Even some places out in the hill country
in Texas we have wells and you bring it

324
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,390
out. It smells like eggs, software.

325
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,250
So there's no way you're going to
stomach drinking that that's so nasty.

326
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,700
And Himalayan salt that you have
on on it.com is to prove too.

327
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:25,190
So it's what she proved. You proved.
What does that mean? Oh Shit, baby. Oh,

328
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,460
it's kosher. Is that what they
call it? Proved to me make that up.

329
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,360
I think a rabbi has to bless it.
Do it a little bit. Well, no,

330
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:37,361
I think and not punch parameters like
not like you can't like rub his balls on

331
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,930
it, you know, none of that.
Yeah, it definitely not.

332
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:43,280
He has to know that the process
has been observed. Yeah.

333
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,790
Do you have like real strict rules?

334
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,620
I think like what's slaughtering animals
especially. Yeah, very specific rules.

335
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,880
But what's kosher and what's not, but you
know it's not kosher bacon, so kosher.

336
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:58,650
Stupid. Okay. That's
ridiculous. Okay. If you don't,

337
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,500
if you don't like Bacon,
you can go fuck yourself for real.

338
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,400
I was thinking about that and I kind of
feel like the Jews are pretty cool with

339
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:07,290
masturbation.
I'm pretty cool with sex.

340
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,200
I feel like they had to pick
something that they get.

341
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,310
They get outlawed and say foot beading
and they were just, they got bacon.

342
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,680
We could live without that
shit. Well, jerk off all day.

343
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:19,350
We'll fuck whoever we want, but
bacon, we're going to outlaw that.

344
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:22,530
So people take our religion seriously
and dirty salt you think and how much

345
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:26,330
tricker gnosis pigs have pigs.
The thing about pigs is that there's,

346
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,550
they're omnivores and they,
they're oftentimes are scavengers,

347
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,460
so they'll eat like wormy food man.

348
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,030
And you can get all kinds of horrible
diseases if you don't cook their meat.

349
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,450
Yeah.

350
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,780
So I'm sure back when they did a shitty
job of cooking meat and they didn't know

351
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:43,110
what the fuck worms where they would
eat that stuff and get really sick and

352
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:47,600
possibly even die. Bacon back then was
like rod dog or go in Africa. Yeah.

353
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,760
I mean dangerous pigs would just
be one going at your own risk.

354
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,260
But it's tempting, you know,
because it's delicious. Yeah.

355
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,480
They didn't know what the fuck they were
doing and those pigs are wild to just

356
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,410
eat and fucking cadavers and shit
and yeah. But wild pigs are dirty.

357
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:09,060
Franks getting rid of evidence.
Yeah. Like that movie snatch. Right.

358
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:13,570
We talked about that. Uh, this
is not even a commercial anymore,

359
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,080
but then install goes Himalayan
salt. Yeah. Go get some, uh,

360
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,500
if you haven't been to
the fitness section on it,

361
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:24,660
we got pretty much anything you need
for a serious rigorous strength and

362
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:25,530
conditioning program.

363
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:28,800
We provide it all when you talk
about stuff for functional strength,

364
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,600
weight vests, battle ropes, kettlebells,
steel maces and steel clubs,

365
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,590
both of them,
which are,

366
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,830
they're excellent for developing like
all full body movement and the kind of

367
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:45,381
strength that you could really translate
into any athletic endeavor or murder.

368
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,810
While if you know,

369
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,800
I really slow shot the Steel Steel Mason,
the club and you're a really strong,

370
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,960
uh, we, we also have jump ropes
now, pull up bar, wall medicine,

371
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,660
full home gym and you know, and
really are functional stuff. Yeah.

372
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,180
And two of the best DVDs we eventually,
we'll make our own DVD.

373
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:11,110
We promise you this, we
promise you this. But for now,

374
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,650
the extreme Kettlebell,

375
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,700
a cardio DVD one and two by
the fabulous keep Keith Weber,

376
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,350
it's tough to keep those
fucking things in office, right?

377
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,350
We actually took over production.
So we've got us covered.

378
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:26,410
You can hammer us with us things
now we're not waiting for oh, Keith.

379
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:30,460
And they send them to us.
He finally worked it out,
right? Yeah, we worked it out.

380
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,620
Is it possible to get those DVDs about
was it was international incident every

381
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:40,150
time we had to try and get
them. Hope you're happy, Keith.
Keith, I hope he's happy.

382
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,130
He's happy. He deserves it. That
is a bad ass workout. Both of them,

383
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,240
they're ruthless. So if you, if you've
never done any kettle bells before,

384
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,780
really our urge you to start slow,
start slow.

385
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:57,781
And if you can hire a trainer to someone
who's Kettlebell certified to just go

386
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:02,560
over the movements with you, you can
work out at home, you can totally get,

387
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:05,050
I do kettle bell workouts
at home all the time,

388
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,210
but the first couple of
times you're doing it,

389
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,280
it would be really smart if you're paid.

390
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:14,020
Very close attention to technique and
very close attention to your form and make

391
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:17,300
sure you don't hurt yourself. We don't
want you hurting yourself. Generally.

392
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,340
We have a bunch of videos

393
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,500
from the a I KFF, which is one of our
really cool new partners. They're, uh,

394
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,240
one of the biggest sanctioning bodies
for Kettlebell sport here in the u s and

395
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,030
two of their top athletes are
on there on the side as well.

396
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:31,260
Given some instructional tips.

397
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,810
If you try to find that on Youtube
Penny stock or you can go to, um,

398
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,600
you should be able to navigate to
it from the kettle bells themselves,

399
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:43,260
not the DVD. But if you go to the youtube
page you can definitely check that out.

400
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,930
And um,
Ken Blackburn,

401
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,890
Mitch Blackburn Rather Than Sun Mitch
is like 165 pounds and set the American

402
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:51,800
record for the um,

403
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,480
the clean impress double clean and
press was 72 pounds. Yeah, each cattle,

404
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,390
he did it like 65 times in 10 minutes
without putting them down. Oh,

405
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,130
bolts on that. He's like
165 pounds, 19 year old kid.

406
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,580
You can see him on the honor roll.
Actually, if you look up Mitch blackboard,

407
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,620
that's somebody, it just shows you what
it is. I mean, and it's form these guys,

408
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,670
their form is impeccable. You have,
they're not wasting any energy at all.

409
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:19,290
It was cool to watch them.
Cool to learn from him.

410
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,330
You know what's really fascinating about
a lot of these guys just they don't

411
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:26,080
look like,
they're not like bodybuilder looking guys.

412
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,430
It's like they have this incredible
strength for the amount of mass that they

413
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:34,900
carry around. Like you were saying,
this guy is 160 pounds, 165 pounds.

414
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:39,100
Jesus Christ. That's a tiny little
fella. There's the guy, right?

415
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:44,101
The fact that the guy that weighs 160
fucking pounds can throw two 72 pound

416
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:45,830
kettle bells around like that.

417
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,790
He was ripping the 90s up and
snatch in the 90s saying whatever.

418
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,890
That's an insane, oh good. What
do you want me to do? Okay,

419
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,710
you've got some shock hair.
I don't know.

420
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:57,890
Like for the average
folk like you would have,

421
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,410
you would struggle with a 35 pounder.
Trust me,

422
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,640
it's hard the first time you do it, it's
real awkward. But what did develops,

423
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,270
I am a fucking huge proponent
of kettlebells. Kettlebells.
It would, it would,

424
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:11,240
it gives me is like real
functional strength,

425
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,200
functional strength that just
directly translates to Jujitsu.

426
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,940
I noticed a big difference in my
rolling when I got really heavy with

427
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,240
kettlebells. Yup. Because it
transferred my workouts from,

428
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,620
oh today I'm going to bench, uh, tomorrow
we're going to do squats and all that.

429
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,920
That gets you stronger.

430
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,190
But there was something different about
doing it all together when you were

431
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:31,820
doing like,

432
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,820
you know like alternating cleans and clean
press squats and he's crazy full body

433
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,900
exercises. It's like you didn't just
get stronger, you also got more fit.

434
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,940
You'll also got like more endurance.

435
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,480
You also got like
translatable explosive energy.

436
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,850
Some of those other main
lifts like bench and squat,

437
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,870
they're really good for getting
you bigger in particular, you know,

438
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,220
and stronger in certain finite ways.

439
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,500
But if you're talking about
general functional strength,

440
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,610
Kettle Bell is the clubs,
the battle ropes, yeses.

441
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,890
That's really going to get
you to get the job done

442
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,710
and it gives you a balanced strength.
And look, if you want to get crazy,

443
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,090
I mean like a lot of people, like there's
dudes that can squat 225 pounds easy.

444
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,090
Like,
I've met a lot of guys who can do that,

445
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,370
but how many guys could do that
with two 120 pound kettle bells,

446
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,470
right? You mean tell me.
You really can do that.

447
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:27,030
You can clean and squat 220 pound
catapults. You probably can't.

448
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,810
You know you're going to wobble
all over the place. You're,

449
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,850
you're dealing with this weird thing
that you have to kind of control them

450
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,050
balanced with. He got to learn how to
hold on to them correctly. You got a bill,

451
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,000
this weird kind of functional strength.

452
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:43,140
We are swinging these fucking cannon
balls around and touching them on your

453
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:47,190
forearm without snapping your
arm. Yeah, it's manly shit. Folks,

454
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,890
go to [inaudible] Dot Com o. N N. I t.

455
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,790
Use a codename Brogan and you will
save 10% off any and all supplements.

456
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,570
Did Somebody Fart? Seriously? I didn't
any natural dick pills coming soon.

457
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,493
That was bad.

458
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,790
My old business, you know,
the natural, the Dick Pills,

459
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,050
we have those rock hard weekends,

460
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:10,130
but we found out that the whole
game and a lot of those pills is,

461
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,460
you just sneak a little Viagra in it and
then you get popped and then you sneak

462
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:16,940
a little Cialis in it and then you get
popped and then your third version is

463
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,200
just pretty garbage. Right? I mean,

464
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:22,370
once you get used to the paradigm of
what those drugs can do, just forget it.

465
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,210
I mean, you can take all the herbs you
want and it's not going to really move the

466
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,490
needle, so to speak. But you know, I mean,

467
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,550
you can help support the systems
in general, like with t plus.

468
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,650
But as far as dick pills themselves,

469
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,390
forget it synthesizes a fucking joke
doesn't even exist. So there's no

470
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,370
like aunt boners or anything that you
could put in there that just natural

471
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,740
calling Ian boners is just by Agra Bro.

472
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,230
It's, yeah. And a lot of them,

473
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:50,010
one's in the gas station actually work
because they're putting like Chinese

474
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,080
viagara and then, yeah. So
it's like you'd think there,

475
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,100
they're a real piece of shit.

476
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:57,040
But you look at some terrible label on
the gas station. It's like, I don't know,

477
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:01,800
phaser laser hard five. And you're like,
what the hell is that? But if you take it,

478
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:06,060
it's like a little bit of
Chinese viagara ridiculous.

479
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:09,870
He's so ridiculous. Like why wouldn't
you take the real critical drug? Well,

480
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:10,920
you know what it is just like,

481
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,450
let's just hope this one works because
some are more powerful than others in

482
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,463
anthrax.

483
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,040
So you like lose all responsibility for
what happens based on the luck of the

484
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,000
draw. It's kind of like
a job, but there's,

485
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,590
I've found a couple of them that like
you really take and it's the most,

486
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:29,520
you're just boner, but oh, that's
hilarious. But it's last seven days. Well,

487
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,330
I'm, it's the Cialis one. Hey listen,
don't die. Please don't die. Uh,

488
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,450
on a.com o n n I t use code name Brogue
and save yourself 10% off any and all

489
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,560
supplements.
Brian

490
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,400
experience,

491
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,460
but hey, you never know
until you try, you know?

492
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,230
Yeah, exactly. This mother Fucker, when
this Dick Pills, you believe this guy,

493
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,710
I took two different brands last week.
Why not?

494
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,040
You would doctor and tell
him your dick is bro,

495
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,940
he will give you amazing drugs.
I'm not saying that it's broken,

496
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,550
but don't tell the doctorates broken.
Did they have a test though?

497
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:18,630
Like does he rubbing it and go like,

498
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,820
you're lying sucks your
cock for five minutes.

499
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:23,220
And if you can think of dead
puppies for five minutes,

500
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,560
then he'll give you the pills. They
can't say no can they? There's no,

501
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,380
there's no way for them to test the horse.
They can't.

502
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,990
They don't want to stimulate your
prostate with a large finger death grip.

503
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,990
And then if you get hard,
they,

504
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,690
they can't obviously. I mean, did you use,
they're going to take your word for it.

505
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:49,410
Why would you say that? You can't get
hard. If you could get hard. Well,

506
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:52,500
you wouldn't lie about
that. What'd Ya, they don't,

507
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,330
nobody breaks their Dick with that stuff.
Do they?

508
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,580
Can you possibly like
break it so that you like,

509
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,040
you can't get a boner without it.
You know how like some dudes,

510
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,730
they get addicted to
those sign the sprays.

511
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,760
The biggest problem is a
psychological addiction. You know,

512
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:09,570
like the back when we were selling the
rock hard that worked back at flashlight

513
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:12,540
because it had flaggers yeah. Alison and
or whatever it had it. And I don't know.

514
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,410
Um, but back when it worked, there was
people who would take it and they'd get,

515
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,090
you know, they start
off with a girl, right?

516
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,700
And they'd be hooking up with a
girl and they were like, oh my God,

517
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,090
you're a god among men.
And then they'd get that.

518
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,940
And then if they didn't have it,
you know,

519
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,250
they would start to panic and then
their brain would start to take action.

520
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,160
Is the brain gets activated
in the sexual act.

521
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,410
Isn't it crazy how different you can
get excited for one girl over another?

522
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,100
Like there are some girls and we all know

523
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,750
them in your life where when you're around
them, it's just like instant flagpole.

524
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,300
And then there's other
girls where it's just,

525
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,420
it just for whatever reason
they can look just as pretty,

526
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,780
they can be just as nice.
They can be just as attractive.

527
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,080
But this is some freak connection you
have with thinkers and people really do

528
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:06,610
think so. Yeah, I think so. I think
really what you're saying is kind of true.

529
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:11,611
Like the juice essence is you have
Zam Zam Isru how's you say that?

530
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,180
That French dip. How's you,
I never knew how to say that.

531
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,690
They don't to that the restaurant.

532
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,590
I know it on the other way where they've
had like guys sleep in the same shirt

533
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:24,820
for,
you know,

534
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,930
a few weeks or whatever and then they
have gross smell the shirts and they'll be

535
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,430
very attracted to one shirt and
completely repulsed by another shirt.

536
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:38,530
Just by smelling the actual pheromones
in it. I would lose that one for sure.

537
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,310
I fucking stink going down.

538
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,120
I eat too much meat. It's all coming
out of my pores and shit. I don't know.

539
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,500
I've smelled some of my clothes. My, uh,

540
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,330
g the worst is Jujitsu
because he take your, you,

541
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,420
you sweat so much and then you take your
shit off and you throw it in your gym

542
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:59,500
bag and then you throw your gym bag in
the trunk where it cooks cause it's 110

543
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:02,050
degrees in La. So you're driving
around with your gym bag,

544
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:06,400
cooking in the trunk and then you pop
that bitch open and unzip it and it's just

545
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:10,500
like ammonia and funk and,
and that's where it,

546
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,390
there's a lot of skin diseases that
people get from that stuff because they

547
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:15,940
don't wash those things
enough and you're essentially,

548
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,510
you're rolling around and
microbes and bacteria and shit.

549
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,380
And the worst part is not when it's fresh,
like fresh sweat is not that bad.

550
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,620
Same as fresh urine. You can drink
your own fresh urine all the time,

551
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,630
but you're leaving me.
I know,

552
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,140
but if you leave a cup of that
year and out for a day or so,

553
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,790
don't fucking drink that.
That's poison.

554
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,320
It's like a breeding ground for further
back to same with your gym clothes.

555
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,290
I would agree that it's sound
advice. Don't drink, drink.

556
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,560
I think I'm going to ship into a
meme. That's the next meal. You,

557
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,800
Uncle Aubrey says don't drink old pis

558
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,090
here it on it. We don't recommend
drinking your own when it's old.

559
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,480
So I'm thinking of trying to do an am
Anita Mascara experience and I'm thinking

560
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:05,950
I'm going to eat it and then drink
my piss and see what's up. Yeah,

561
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,920
that's what you're supposed to do. I
would say no. I said, well, I'll do it.

562
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,400
I'll do it once and then I got to try it.

563
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,930
I've tried everything else for real folks.
This isn't a shamanically tradition.

564
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:18,310
I know you're listening
to this and you're like,

565
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,940
there's no way these guys are serious.
No. The true shamonic tradition is,

566
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,390
it was explained to me, um, by uh,

567
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,920
this Guy Jack Herer and he
said that the idea is that you,

568
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,610
you eat the, the drug, the plant
mush. I'm an eater. Miscarriage.

569
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,740
It's a very different,
it's not psilocybin,

570
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,220
it's some other type of what
you're shooting for is Musk, Amal.

571
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,280
You should, the active compound
is Musk, Amal and what its Axon,

572
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:44,840
a very different mechanism action.

573
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,570
So the mechanism of action
of emoney to miscarry,

574
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,880
it actually acts as a Gaba agonist,

575
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,930
so it's going to give you more of the
neurotransmitter Gaba where it's still the

576
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,960
[inaudible] the mechanism of
action that there recently finding,

577
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:58,970
which I learned a lot about
at the maps conferences,

578
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,920
mechanism of action of Siliciden is it's
actually restricting blood flow to your

579
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,900
default mode network,
part of your brain,

580
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:10,220
which is your top down control mechanism
in your brain so that you're basically

581
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:15,050
your mental cerebral filter that allows
you to focus on the day to day mundane

582
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:18,440
tasks starts to go to sleep and that
happens to be the center that controls

583
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,910
depression and a bunch of other things,

584
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,640
which is why the clinical application is
proving so important and impressive and

585
00:33:24,641 --> 00:33:28,100
and all these people, but that's a
totally different mechanism of action.

586
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:29,600
Then the Amanita miscarried,

587
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,370
which is basically flooding your brain
with more Gabba from what I understand,

588
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,061
but the Musk,

589
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:39,080
Amal is a tricky beast and it doesn't
necessarily come out through your gut.

590
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,890
However, once it gets processed
through your kidneys and you piss it,

591
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,020
it can be passed up to five times.
They say through different people.

592
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,160
So like I could Piss,

593
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,910
oh, you could drink it, you
could piss give it to Brian.

594
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,990
He could pick it and then Brian could
give it to two other people and everybody

595
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:01,520
will be high as fuck. Wow. That's
what they say. How would they know?

596
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,330
How would they know? Why would they find
out? What are we doing with our lives?

597
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:07,370
Which sitting around drinking
each other's pice to get high.

598
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,710
What are you seeing in fairies?
Cock sucker watching Pluto.

599
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,650
He's supposed to be kind of like a
little bit drunk and a little bit like a

600
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,980
little bit high,
like a psychedelic.

601
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,930
I only had one experience and it didn't
work. You didn't drink your own piss.

602
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:28,380
You got to commit. You've gotta go
in. You can't just put the tip in.

603
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:31,590
You gotta go miles deep.
Huh? Is that how it works?

604
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,960
You're supposed to just eat it and then
drink your own piston and that's what

605
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:34,890
gets you high.
I mean

606
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,410
there's some ways that I think you
can heat it and like lightly bake it.

607
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:38,771
I don't know.

608
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:43,270
But I think the sure fire way if you
really want to commit is to eat it.

609
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,820
Then drink your piss and then you can,
you know,

610
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,090
but you feel so stupid. If it's
getting worse. That's true.

611
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:51,700
Sitting there with piss mouth,
not high.

612
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,730
I'm just thinking what kind of a losing
him. I should just become a republican.

613
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,530
Okay. I should just go the other way and
get single malt scotch and sneaking some

614
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:03,110
Cuban cigars and just become an
asshole or renting a movie while I'm,

615
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,340
but if it works it around eating mushrooms
and drinking piss the fuck am I doing

616
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:11,224
with my life.

617
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,840
You got a dirty garage like I was
going to get to that but I had to eat

618
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,300
mushrooms and drink my own piss first.
I'm a fucking real winter over here.

619
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,340
I'm going to film it for,

620
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,640
for all of the savages cause it
is perfectly legal in the US.

621
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,730
Seminated Mascara is not
a scheduled substance,

622
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:29,250
so the reward if it
works and it was awesome.

623
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,470
It was pretty cool because we
actually have something legal to do.

624
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,270
Yeah, and you're just going to encourage
people to do that. No, I don't. I'm not.

625
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,980
Look, please let me be
the pig here. I don't

626
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,050
know. It could be terrible,
but I'll let you know.

627
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,860
You have to give one estate if it's bad.
Also you have to have a [inaudible].

628
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,490
There's just like all with pissy mouth.

629
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,680
Self paid feeling the lowest of the low.
I've never met anyone,

630
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,940
but he's had a good one. Is it a good a
amnesia, miscarry or experience or not?

631
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,540
Not. Not that I can remember
anybody telling me about one.

632
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,770
They've always said like, oh,
it didn't work for me. Yeah,

633
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,720
I met somebody who had a weird
one and a not so good one

634
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,973
drink,
pee bro.

635
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:11,290
Weird and not so good, but there
is piss drinking. So come on,

636
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:15,460
join the party. That's a tradition around
it though, you know? I don't mean that.

637
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:18,550
We can all check each other's pissed by.
Come on over here.

638
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,930
He's got it all figured out.

639
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,370
You just got to get a fresh is in to
you and then you piss him. No, no, no.

640
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:28,450
See that's not how it's done. I forgot to
bring cups. We all thought how it works.

641
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:30,570
I just pissing your mouth and
is that what we do with you?

642
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,760
That's straight from the spout kind of
Potty we doing here the freshest way to

643
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:37,690
get this in his ass mouth.
We're going to work this out.

644
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:41,690
We're going to get high
as fuck disappeared.

645
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,420
It is exactly what
he's trying to trick us in.

646
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,640
You stumble upon this fucking party.
You open up the tent door.

647
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,240
What the fuck's Piss all over the
place. Bunch of guys. The Kochs names.

648
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,900
We just trying to get enlightenment
but imagine if it does work and you get

649
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:01,600
someone really high and they love it
and then you could trick them constantly

650
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,940
cause my piss.
You just get a drink

651
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,020
it yet here. That would pissed them off.
One. It tastes like total primary care.

652
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,750
Maybe some tea.
Plus did you pack it like a musket?

653
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,770
Why is Doctor Laser wearing lipstick?

654
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,040
We need to call doctor laser and ask him
how many of those books behind him he's

655
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,120
red cause it's driving us crazy.
Yeah.

656
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,710
I picture a doctor Lacey's get those old
school books and nobody really reads.

657
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,090
Yeah,
he's old and he's read them.

658
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,420
I don't know the best way to answer.
That's the best way it is.

659
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:44,730
The finished that say, I don't know.
I don't know. But he does have have

660
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,240
the brain surgery kit from
Napoleon's fuel doctor.

661
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,080
Pretty cool shots in his office.
Yeah.

662
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:56,170
They had a brain surgery big saw like it
looks more like woodworking equipment,

663
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,930
but like really finely crafted
made woodworking equipment,

664
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,300
things that like crack things,
things that saw things. Oh my God.

665
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:06,750
He debts and he actually uses it.

666
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,350
Basically he has his patients walked by
it and if they get queasy and they can't

667
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:13,450
handle it, he's like, no, you're
not the person for me. Cause he's a,

668
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,461
he's a tinkerer.

669
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:18,180
I mean he's going to go in there and
actually cut your head and do some work.

670
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,590
That's what his specialty is.

671
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,810
He's done like 3000 open skulls or
surgeries or something like that.

672
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,730
Oh yeah, he's in it. He's no
gee, he's cool. Holy Shit.

673
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,250
You imagine working at 3000 brains.
Yeah.

674
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,130
What an power that

675
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,490
must be to those guys like that they,

676
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,730
they can fix someone's brain.
You know, I kind of agree.

677
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,500
Kind of out your cancer and fix your brain
and then send you back to how it live.

678
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,060
A healthy life.
Yup.

679
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,630
And he did it. I met one of the guys
that he did that for. This guy, uh,

680
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,270
is one of his patients and it's
pretty remarkable. Went through there,

681
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,370
did the brain surgery and then from,

682
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,280
and that's actually how I met Dr
[inaudible]. He did the brain surgery.

683
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:03,950
Then he took a bunch of the ingredients.
We have an Alpha brain too,

684
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,310
and he recovered like way fast.
This is of course just one story,

685
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:12,311
but he recovered super fast and that turn
Dr Lasar onto the potential for these

686
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,110
herbs to work in conjunction with
what he was doing on the brain.

687
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,720
So that's how we kinda got got hooked up.

688
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,470
That's interesting. Did, did he ever
talk to um, a Roman [inaudible]?

689
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,900
No, he hasn't, but we talked
about that a little bit.

690
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:29,140
I think it's actually in
the long interview that we
have up there. But um, yeah,

691
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:32,620
the uh, the brain damage issue
is pretty, it's pretty serious.

692
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,180
I don't think he's ever been
hooked up with bill though.

693
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,500
Yeah. Well Roman Ascii, that's
why he created that neuro one.

694
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,820
That was the first nootropic that
I had heard of. We were on um, um,

695
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,850
no name and no name and Alice or Alison?
No named Sarah and Nunu Sarah.

696
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:50,760
No name rather on Alice
radio. Yeah. Anyway. Um,

697
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,610
and a no name African.
His real name.

698
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,380
I always called them no names. How weird
is that? It's top cool guy. Anyway,

699
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,490
he was training with Bill Roman house
key and Bill Romanowski got them to start

700
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:06,820
eating healthy and started giving him
this neuro one shit. Well this is this a,

701
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,200
it was like,

702
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,170
it's a nootropic but it's also got
like a little bit of caffeine in it.

703
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,920
It's pretty interesting stuff and he
developed it because of concussions. Yeah,

704
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,510
makes sense.
You've got to feed,

705
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:19,560
feed back the brain when it's been
deprived from getting swollen,

706
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,210
swollen and pushed up against your skull.
It was had a good program.

707
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,710
I was at a, a a neurological
research center today and uh,

708
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,350
one of the things that these people
were telling me why they were there,

709
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:33,180
I was there for this silly TV show.

710
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,250
But there's people that take their
kids there. Like if the kids are uh,

711
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,250
involved in football and then football
injuries and they're talking about it

712
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:42,390
like these kids don't like 15,

713
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:47,060
16 years old and they just have these
massive concussions and the father's like,

714
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,650
well when can you get back in there?
And the mother is like,

715
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,080
is he going to be okay?
Right.

716
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,290
The mothers are concerned that their
kid is getting really badly hurt and the

717
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:59,450
fathers are, they want him to get
back in there. It's weird. She's she,

718
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:03,270
she was describing it to me like you
know these situations that she's dealing

719
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:05,790
with with these fathers and
these kids and she's like,

720
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:09,630
it's really creepy cause these kids
don't know any better and they're just

721
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,940
running their dads and like want them
to get back in there like they get can

722
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:15,840
cost.
Like do you understand what that is?

723
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,020
Do you understand what getting
shut off is running on each other,

724
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:21,780
colliding hands.
Do you know whoa

725
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,260
man and the brain, there's so much
more we still have to learn about it.

726
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:27,640
Did you happen to see that thing
on 60 minutes? Where there,

727
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,070
there are people who are now able to
control prosthetic limbs with their

728
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:36,380
thoughts alone and did you see that?
So basically they hook up these,

729
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:37,970
they hook up these arms.
Now the first,

730
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,870
the first version prototype was they
hooked the arms up and they actually

731
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,970
hardwire it somehow into the nerves.

732
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,100
But it's still their
thoughts that can allow them,

733
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:50,240
like they can shake hands with people
just from like their brain telling this

734
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:54,260
completely prosthetic arm to
shake hands or like grab a ball.

735
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,980
They can tell if a ball is hard or a
telephone ball is soft just from feedback.

736
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:02,650
It's bilateral. So it's not only they're
squeezing but their fingers can give, uh,

737
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,230
signals to their brain and let him know
if what they're squeezing as hard or

738
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:08,090
soft.
So it goes both ways.

739
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,070
And then they figured out how to hook it
up wirelessly so that they can actually

740
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,680
control arms that are not even on them.

741
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,190
And they can make those arms
move just with their thoughts.

742
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:23,060
So [inaudible] was on 60 minutes, like
a week ago. I was fucking blown away.

743
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,620
So like an Avatar type
thing? Totally. Well not,

744
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,610
but the first steps,

745
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:32,900
like the big baby steps
towards doing it with Wifi.

746
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,080
Yeah. I mean I was, what
is that? You remember that?

747
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:40,120
It's the old experiments where they pretty
much did, let me see. Oh, those rush. Oh,

748
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,930
don't show me this. The dog
had won. That shit ain't cool.

749
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,520
I don't even know if that's
real. Is that real? It's real.

750
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,900
I don't want the Russians.
It was a cool segment on, uh,

751
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,930
on 60 minutes that it's literally like
probably two weeks ago. Wow, that's,

752
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,810
that's fucking freaky. Pretty. I the,

753
00:42:57,811 --> 00:43:00,140
the crazy part to me was
the fact that they could,

754
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,130
it was giving him signals back from
their fingers to their brain. That was,

755
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,860
that was what really blew my, I mean,
I guess the whole thing, did you know,

756
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:12,110
just the fact that you think of this brain
and thoughts is this kind of nebulous

757
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,110
thing, but it's actually, it is a signal.

758
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,700
There is some kind of electrical signal
that they can get a machine program,

759
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:24,530
a machine to receive and
respond based upon a thought,

760
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,950
a willful action to do something.
It can pick that up.

761
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:29,630
I don't know how the hell that happens

762
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,440
and imagine if they can do that now.

763
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:36,330
Imagine what a thousand years
from now it's holiday. Yeah.

764
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:41,970
Probably will be able to just lie in bed
and send our robot out to do everything

765
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:44,530
we needed to do. Drive the car, you know,

766
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:47,200
and we look through its eyes as it
drives the car. We looked through,

767
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:49,150
it says eyes as it goes
to the supermarket,

768
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:52,510
picks up groceries and we're just
sitting at home, beaten off, beaten off,

769
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:56,560
pretending with this person and the
robot wanders through the fucking town.

770
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,580
Does all your tasks come back home and
you never leave the house? Yeah. Yeah.

771
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,650
But imagine and then the
application for sports,

772
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:05,080
there's been a couple of movies like that,
but you could go full.

773
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,250
Let's say you created this kind of
android creature that you can control with

774
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:09,641
your mind.

775
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:14,641
You could go full gladiator style with
net and tried to sort and just have the

776
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:17,650
most brutal. Obviously it'd be expensive
because machines are expensive, whatever.

777
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,740
But that'd be sweet. That'd be crazy.
Bumper cars with a Ferrari. That's true.

778
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,260
But you want to just take your fucking
robot body torture people with it.

779
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,040
Yeah, no, don't do that.
But I bet you know what they

780
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,040
would do. You know like
people play the sims. Yeah,

781
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,710
I bet they would play like a
real live version of the sims.

782
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,220
Just let their human body go out there
and interact with all these other robot

783
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,070
bodies. You know, they
take their body, they uh,

784
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,330
they lie down and they look through the
body or look through the eyes of this

785
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:49,770
thing and then send it off.

786
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,520
Like it's a little game and you send your
robot out and the robot goes and fucks

787
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:57,270
other robots and parties and your robots
and animal and he drinks and drives.

788
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,860
Cause he doesn't even
live in the real world.

789
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:00,270
He lives in this fucking crazy robot.

790
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:02,520
Why don't we realize that's
what's already happening?

791
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:07,320
Where is the robot has
turned us in and do a robot?

792
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,630
I keep on thinking simulation
theory at the shit. Like,

793
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:12,270
like your inner voice is
actually you in the future.

794
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:16,260
Like talking to yourself or
something like that. Hit me. Right.

795
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,340
I think, I think everybody knows,
especially when you're impulsive, fuck.

796
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:23,870
Like I know you are and I
am and you've been to sun.

797
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,600
We all been a little bit
impulsive and there's always,

798
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:28,370
when you're about to do something
and there's a voice, it goes,

799
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:30,260
don't fucking do it,
dude.

800
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,710
You gotta listen to that voice always.

801
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,920
That voice is always right.
You know, there's like a

802
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,380
weird rush on the other side
too that tells you not to do it.

803
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,940
Like it's kind of feel good.
You know,

804
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:45,170
like when you're about to like if you're
about to yell at somebody and you know

805
00:45:45,171 --> 00:45:48,480
you shouldn't do that,
there's pretty much no reason everything.

806
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,610
Yeah,
you're right.

807
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:54,610
But when you get this kind of like energy
that comes up and it feels like it's

808
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:58,890
going to be good to release it.
Yup. What the fuck is that? Oh,

809
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,190
that's you protecting yourself.
Well, why does it feel good though?

810
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,640
It feels good because sometimes people
need to be shown that their cons,

811
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,110
an evolutionary response. The
only way people learn, um,

812
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,580
how to behave is by feedback.

813
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,660
The way they learn how to be harmonious
with their fellow brothers and sisters

814
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:18,230
of the world.

815
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,400
It's by feedback and when you're not good
at it and you get bad feedback all the

816
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:23,750
time and you don't adjust,

817
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,040
that's like a sign of mental
illness or stupidity or a,

818
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:33,041
a lack of education or lack of someone
explaining or your own personal critical

819
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:37,910
thinking involving the way the
world works. But for most people,

820
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:38,631
as you get older,

821
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:42,140
you get way better at communicating
because you've gone through this feedback

822
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:46,370
loop several times and he sorta stabilize
it and you know what people like and

823
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:50,030
what they don't like and you know how
to get things off on the right foot and

824
00:46:50,031 --> 00:46:53,960
how not to, and it's like sort
of easier to navigate. And

825
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,300
he, there is, as you know,

826
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:01,330
the key there is not to become completely
enslaved by the feelings and thoughts

827
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:06,380
and the kind of world around you and so
that you're constantly living to please

828
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,260
what the Toltecs would call
it, the dream, you know,

829
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,520
the cocreated world around you.
So yes, don't be a Dick, you know,

830
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:16,370
learn not to hurt people.
But then at the same time,

831
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:21,580
don't judge yourself according to all of
these opinions that are generally wrong

832
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:26,300
anyways. People don't necessarily always
want you to be your best, you know,

833
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:30,370
so you gotta find your inner path as well.
Adjust

834
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,380
to guiding principle.

835
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:35,260
It's a real problem for young people
when they're dealing with haters,

836
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:37,650
like the first haters in their life.
You know,

837
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,230
like it could be someone who's at work
with you or someone you go on to school

838
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:42,064
with or whatever,

839
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,340
but it might be like the first time you
like for someone like actively hates on

840
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:47,020
you and that should can affect you.

841
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,100
And I always say that it's like
snake venom and that like Kevin,

842
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,550
a little bit of Haider is like good
cause you know how to deal with it.

843
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,400
And then when, when you get a full
blast of it, you're like, bitch,

844
00:47:57,401 --> 00:48:00,760
I'm immune to that stupid
shit. And they're like, you've
been bitten a few times.

845
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:04,210
You understand it. Because people who
don't have never been hated on before,

846
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:06,940
like you see them get hated on,
they're like, oh my goodness.

847
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,470
Just that wave of negativity that can
erupt at any time on the Internet.

848
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,680
That absolutely. I mean, you
know, I felt that the first time,

849
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:17,650
obviously in sports or whatever,
you get these mild detractors,

850
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:19,630
but you can always kind of see him.

851
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,810
But then as soon as I stepped into
the public eye, a lot of support,

852
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:27,580
a lot of amazing people I've met and
then a contingency of people who hate me

853
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,460
just despise me. And I was
looking at him like, why?

854
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,150
What is the reason?
Like I couldn't properly deal with it.

855
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:41,780
I think I had to talk to many people I
could and just kind of started a house.

856
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,960
There's some people that are just
going to be negative no matter what.

857
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,190
But there's also,
it's fucked up thing,

858
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,000
but there's a truth in that. It's
good to get your ass kicked. Yeah.

859
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,010
And it's good to get your ass
kicked on by the Internet too.

860
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,140
It's good.
You know it,

861
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,800
it doesn't seem like it's good when it's
happening and it might be completely

862
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:06,640
off base,
but if it's right even a little bit,

863
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,940
they're doing you a service
because they're pointing
out holes and you're tying

864
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:13,360
up your game. Yeah. The pointing out
holes in your game and it might be,

865
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,890
it might be fair, but in nine might not
be fair to you got to deal with that too.

866
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:21,280
But that's part of the
game that's part of you.

867
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,350
And eventually,

868
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,740
hopefully we all hope for some form of
personal sovereignty where no matter what

869
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:32,140
anybody says about you or
how anybody describes you,

870
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,570
it's better way of putting it. You know
who you are. I know you're all right.

871
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,820
And like all they're doing is exposing
this need to detract from another person,

872
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:47,290
just need to diminish another person.
And she's a massive weakness. It is.

873
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,980
And you know, along and we've
all been guilty of, uh, for
sure. And along with that,

874
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:55,040
it's also learning to take the praise.
Not too seriously. Yes. You know,

875
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,060
you can't get your tires last humped up
and really buy into that whole thing and

876
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:05,730
that'll lead you down a stray weird
path of ego and feeding off that kind of

877
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,400
energy that's no good either,
either to tractors or too much praise.

878
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:11,110
Just appreciate it for what it is,

879
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:14,340
but really judge yourself by your
own criteria. Criteria, you know,

880
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:18,580
you know only you know
really if you did your best,

881
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:23,140
if you put out the maximum effort to
try and achieve the result, and I only,

882
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:25,930
you should be able to judge
yourself toe. Yeah. Well if you're,

883
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,270
if you're really objective and
that's what we should all strive for.

884
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:31,100
Writing like real objectivity.

885
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:35,240
If he could really just fucking really
look at what you're doing right or wrong

886
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,760
and what you're enjoying about your life,
what you're not,

887
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,230
kind of get that bitch back on track
sometimes it's hard to see yourself there,

888
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:43,100
has to see other people,

889
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:46,640
which is why a lot of the most fucked
up people with the most fucked up lives

890
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,830
always want to give you advice.
Yeah.

891
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,740
I could wants to give you more advice
than someone whose life is a mess.

892
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,030
You know what you gotta do,
man.

893
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:55,670
You've got to get together with your girl
and you've got to work this out. Okay.

894
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,070
I know you don't want to work this out,
but you've got to work and you're like,

895
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:02,120
you really given advice on relationships.
You crazy fuck head.

896
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,990
They say that most of the people who get
degrees in psychology are the ones who

897
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:09,710
are trying to work out their own
problems that most vehemently. I mean,

898
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:13,930
I don't know, that's just
hearsay, but that's, yeah. Yeah.

899
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,660
I would think of psychologists would
do the word of shit when they beat up.

900
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,870
You know what I mean? Things.
What is it? What is a sexual, uh,

901
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,060
like one of those people
that's like a sexual counselor.

902
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,200
What did they beat it off to? You
know, do they be constantly analyzing?

903
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:31,370
It can't be that much fun. Yeah. Right.
Like how do they really totally cut loose.

904
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,660
You're constantly thinking about
whether or not she did as good.

905
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,210
Up to objectivity is a real challenge.

906
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:40,580
And I think one of the tools
that both me and you have found,

907
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:45,260
I've been different ways to break through
that kind of mental patterning that

908
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:48,260
gets you in trouble.
So the tank is a great way to do it.

909
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,470
And there's different meditation
techniques that are great ways,

910
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:56,240
but sometimes for us to really fix gold
monkeys like myself and you and some

911
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:59,990
other people when we just need
something heavier to do it.

912
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,510
And I think that's when,
you know,

913
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,520
I've gone to Peru and done
the Iowasca or you can go,

914
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,780
so hopefully somewhere safe and do a
heavy psilocybin trip or find some way to

915
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:14,360
actually get that part of your
mind to really be objective,

916
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:18,230
to kind of cut out all the bullshit and
look at yourself with a true reflection.

917
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:23,270
Yeah. And I feel like there's certain
doors that get open when you have those

918
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:26,270
experiences and when those doors get open,

919
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,450
it's like the whole world
just takes a turn to the left.

920
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,180
Like it's just not the same world
anymore. Yeah. It's just not.

921
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,360
And that's scary for a lot of people.
Mad and it makes sense,

922
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,090
but you got to really
look at it objectively.

923
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,430
And one of the things
you got to look at is

924
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,770
do you really like the world
the way it is? I really scared.

925
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:48,980
And taking a left turn into crazyville
crazy film might not be that bad.

926
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,890
Trust me,
the regular world is crazy enough.

927
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,990
Take a little trip down the Leprechaun
lane and have a chat with the pixies and

928
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:59,300
the other dimensions.
It's not a bad idea.

929
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,580
You got to know what the fuck is
going on with your brain though.

930
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:05,330
That's the problem. I would never
tell anybody to do mushrooms or acid.

931
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,410
And even though I have, I would never
tell anybody to do any. Now today,

932
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,950
knowing what I know would
never tell anybody to do any
psychedelic cause I don't

933
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:16,550
know how the fuck their brain works.
And then, so having an in something,

934
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:19,640
I always kind of reiterate,
having a really good guide is important.

935
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,900
Someone who can not only ask you
questions but kind of look you in the eye,

936
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,100
analyze, um, what you should

937
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,070
or should not do. I mean,
even the shamans down in Peru,

938
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:31,770
part of the ceremony is
before you get the Iowasca,

939
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,220
they kind of get a sense of you,
even if you can't speak the language,

940
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:38,640
but they get a sense of being, you
can sense crazy. You know, like,

941
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:43,641
especially they're highly tuned to do
that and they look at you and how's it

942
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,370
going? Why some people get like
a really little tiny, you know,

943
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:50,790
third of a cup and then
they go on their way.

944
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,760
Because that's all that the Shamans,
no, that's all they can handle.

945
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:56,310
That's all they're in for. And
then other people, you know,

946
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:58,320
they'll fill that bitch
to the brim and bid.

947
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:02,920
I'll come back for more if you want it.
That thick,

948
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,170
thick,

949
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,910
Brown bittery fiery
Iowasca into your stomach.

950
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,170
And you know what, I've never understood
about the IOWASCA thing. I must say.

951
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,820
I'm going to have to do, I'll ask
it to learn this, the tobacco thing,

952
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,330
like what is it about the,

953
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,920
is blowing tobacco smoke that
activates some of the helices surgeons.

954
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,170
I think it has to do with your actually
your nicotinic receptors in your brain

955
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:29,430
there. So there's something, you know,
the DMT, the tryptamine like a stack,

956
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,090
like you're stacking,
that's these receptors.

957
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:36,060
And this is swimming a little
deeper than I probably can go,

958
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:40,140
but I think it has something, you know,
nicotine acts on certain mental receptors.

959
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:44,370
Um, I think it's your nicotinic receptors
and then tryptamine acts on certain

960
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:48,390
receptors and somehow there is a,
there is a synergy there.

961
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,410
I haven't necessarily experienced that,
but what I did experience,

962
00:54:52,411 --> 00:54:56,310
which was really weird,
I have no very good explanation for this,

963
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,770
but at the end of one particular ceremony,

964
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,590
he smoked the tobacco.

965
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,760
The chairman smoked the tobacco Rustica
which is different than the tobacco that

966
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:09,270
we smoke. It's a different
species of plant entirely.

967
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,190
So Tobacco Rustica they smoked a big hand
rolled cigarette from that and he like

968
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,360
blew the smoke all over my body. I didn't
feel anything at the moment. I was like,

969
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:21,570
okay well I'm going to smell like
this burnt plant. Cool. That's good.

970
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:25,710
But he really like took care and put
it on certain points and there's always

971
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:28,740
some kind of purgative
element to the IOWASCA.

972
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,460
But that night I was like
shitting and vomiting.

973
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,453
Like I had,

974
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,530
like there was some evil in my body
that was trying to escape like the most

975
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:44,580
violent purge I've ever had in my life.
It was,

976
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,810
and it went on for hours. I don't know
where stuff was coming out of my body.

977
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,850
Right. And I've, I've done,
I watched it many times,

978
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,720
so I know what the normal purchase this
was. They have outhouses or five times.

979
00:55:55,590 --> 00:56:00,420
Now the, you have a little toilet in
your, in your place. Sometimes toilet.

980
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,530
Uh, depends. Sometimes no.
Sometimes that's just a hole.

981
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,830
And sometimes you do have running
water depending on where you go,

982
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,190
but a lot of times they don't have toilet
lids because you're not supposed to

983
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:14,820
sit there and really enjoy, you're
supposed to just hover, blow it out,

984
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,960
and then wipe and put it in a basket.
That's kind of the general program,

985
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,360
but put it in a basket.
Yeah. Cause it can't,

986
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,110
they can't keep it in the toilet paper
around the system. Yeah. Oh. But anyway,

987
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:30,460
so there's some kind of cleansing
aspect to it. It doesn't make any sense.

988
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,150
The science, I don't know, I don't
understand, but I know that, you know,

989
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:39,320
they believe it's a cleansing ritual and
it's certainly had that effect on me.

990
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:43,110
Wow. It just blows it out.
And then that tobacco,

991
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:47,680
he kicked it in something, something
and he blew a lot of smoke, all of them.

992
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:51,370
And then the next day he sees me and
he starts laughing as I'm walking,

993
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,850
like walking by him, he just
starts laughing and getting,
he asked me, you know,

994
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:58,840
how was last night? And
he's, I had someone with me,
you can help me translate.

995
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:00,640
And I was like,
what the hell did you do to me?

996
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,690
And he's just laughing and laughing and
just pats me on the back and just keeps

997
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:07,910
on walking. Like he knew that's
exactly what he was going to do. Wow.

998
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,490
So he was doing that just to get you to
get rid of all the shit inside of you

999
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:13,324
and throw up,

1000
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:18,420
cleaned it all out and then dose up
the next night while dragging juice.

1001
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:19,091
Exactly.

1002
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:22,420
And the next night was the night that
I went out and did the ride on that

1003
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,490
smuggled. That makes sense. Wow.

1004
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:29,491
He cleans your system out with
some smoke stuff that they found

1005
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:34,730
DMT and the pineal gland of live
rats. Huge. Yeah. Huge. Yeah.

1006
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:38,300
This is Rick Strassman's
Cottonwood Research Foundation.

1007
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,400
He, um, he, uh, just, uh,

1008
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,160
I mean this is something that they
had speculated for the longest time.

1009
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,930
I thought it was a fact.

1010
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:52,370
I thought that they had known it was a
fact until a Voodoo chicken on my message

1011
00:57:52,371 --> 00:57:54,020
board was I think the first guy to,

1012
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,590
to clue me in to the fact that there's
only like anecdotal evidence and he was

1013
00:57:57,591 --> 00:58:01,170
like challenging Strassman on
the message board because, uh,

1014
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:05,120
we know that the human body produces it.
Then they, I guess they knew it produced,

1015
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:07,580
it was produced in the
liver and the lungs,

1016
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:12,710
but this is the first time they can prove
that at least in rodents it's in the

1017
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,110
pineal gland of alive.

1018
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:17,120
Right? Yeah. I think when you,
and when you're the way that,

1019
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,910
let's suppose it was the spirit mark,
right?

1020
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:24,530
Let's suppose that hypothesis is true
and it is some part of conducting the

1021
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:27,950
spirit from source into life
and then back out. You know,

1022
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:30,290
let's say that there is some
activation for that. Um,

1023
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:35,180
it makes sense that they wouldn't find
the active concentrations in the dead

1024
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:39,440
Peniel glands because presumably
it's purpose was done there.

1025
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:44,180
But to see it there in
live, in live, um, you know,

1026
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,120
and while it's living
I think is pretty cool,

1027
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,210
at least opens up that
theory as a possible.

1028
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,170
One of the interesting things
about taking the DMT was

1029
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,531
the,

1030
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:57,180
the shortness of the trip and that's
what the thing that people was coming on,

1031
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,920
that one of the signs that this isn't,

1032
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,970
this isn't a deadly drug, is how easy
your body can get rid of it. Yeah. Your,

1033
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,240
your body can get rid of it and bring
you back to baseline in 15 minutes.

1034
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:13,350
Like you're on this voyage to another
dimension and then 15 minutes later your

1035
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:14,300
body's like, okay, okay.

1036
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,110
Nothing to see here. We just get to clean
this up folks. Yeah. What'd you cook?

1037
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,230
And just come in there with a broom
and sweep up all the memories.

1038
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,280
What you just did.

1039
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,820
Um, it, it seems like your body
knows what to do with this shit.

1040
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,550
It obviously makes it, we know
it makes it, we know that,

1041
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:33,140
but now we know that literally the third
eye makes it and that's fucking crazy

1042
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,970
because that's,
that's literally,

1043
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,150
I hate when I say literally because I
shouldn't have said it that many times.

1044
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:43,010
That was my version of Ugh, that
was literally, I should have said,

1045
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,660
ah.
Anyway,

1046
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,100
they've proven that at least in rodents,

1047
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,760
this sacred of all sacred glands,

1048
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,600
this gland that the Egyptians
thought was the seat of the soul,

1049
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,070
this gland,

1050
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:03,071
that eastern mysticism had forever
connected with an eye of enlightenment,

1051
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,940
that that gland produces the most
potent psychedelic drug known to man.

1052
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,860
That's fucking bananas.
Pretty wild. It's nuts.

1053
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:15,800
So many cross cultures too that you know,
have,

1054
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,440
have some kind of belief in
that center of your, you know,

1055
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:22,170
in that center of your forehead where
your pineal gland is. It's pretty,

1056
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,410
it's pretty unique. And you know, the
shamans down there, the interesting thing,

1057
01:00:25,411 --> 01:00:25,621
you know,

1058
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:29,520
and I was reading Danieli Billy's book
about creating your own religion and the

1059
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:31,700
distinctions between
religion and you know,

1060
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:36,350
what both feel as like true spirituality.
And some of it is, you know,

1061
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,390
it's not people telling you
that it's, you know, feeling it,

1062
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:44,370
it's feeling that kind of activation
or feeling what that feels like.

1063
01:00:44,371 --> 01:00:49,140
And there's been times when I've been
taking Iowasca where my most intense

1064
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:54,141
experiences come with a really intense
buzzing energy that feels like not only

1065
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:57,390
that part of my head but starting there,

1066
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:02,340
the energy feels like it peels off my
whole scalp starting in my third eye,

1067
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,160
middle of my forehead region,
all the way to the back of my head,

1068
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,840
what they would call the Crown Chakra.

1069
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:10,320
And I don't know too much about chocolates
but I know that that's what I felt

1070
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:12,150
from right here to the back of my head.

1071
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:16,500
It was like somebody peeled it off and
it had an electric field and electric

1072
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:18,660
current over it.
And when you get that feeling,

1073
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,890
you know you're in for some fucking
cool shit that Redmond cool shit happen.

1074
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,790
Like that is the precursor to the
craziest experiences of your, of your

1075
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,840
spiritual oh yeah. Yeah. It's,

1076
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,630
it's,

1077
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:38,630
it's a language that you can only speak
with people who've had some form of

1078
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:39,820
experience,
something.

1079
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:43,090
Cause there's a lot of people out there
and there's nothing wrong with that.

1080
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,290
Nothing wrong with going through.

1081
01:01:44,291 --> 01:01:47,050
I don't think there's anything wrong with
going through your whole life as long

1082
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:48,760
as you're enjoying it.
Why?

1083
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,860
Why have a psychedelic
experience if you don't want to,

1084
01:01:50,861 --> 01:01:53,740
if you don't feel compelled, I feel like
if you feel compelled, give it a shot.

1085
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:58,360
But when you're having these conversations
and you're talking about your shock,

1086
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:02,510
we're blowing open and putting
yourself to dimensions and Phis,

1087
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:07,240
crazy flotillas or serpents flying
above your head. I hear you.

1088
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,840
And I'm like, yeah, wow,
okay, wow. Fucking hey.

1089
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:15,130
Like I know that really happened because
I've seen some crazy shit myself.

1090
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,790
Not that it really happened. Not
that it's really a snake, but,

1091
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:22,800
but my point that what people always
go, well you know, if it's not real,

1092
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,370
okay then you're doing something
really infant tile. Okay.

1093
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:30,030
You're taking something that's allowing
you to go into fantasy land for a little

1094
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:33,840
while maybe.
Or listen,

1095
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:38,870
what if I could prove that it takes you
to another dimension and the in that

1096
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:41,520
other dimension,

1097
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:46,521
you will see things that you could not
possibly have imagined and you will

1098
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:52,161
experience novelty and honesty and wisdom
in love in the purest forms possible,

1099
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:57,660
like their joy,

1100
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,770
like their waves hitting you where
you're standing on the beach.

1101
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:07,380
If I could tell you that it was definitely
taking you to another dimension,

1102
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,770
would you go then? I don't know.
Maybe not, but here's what I know.

1103
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:18,080
Here's what I know for sure.
If it took you to another dimension,

1104
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:22,530
you had that experience or if you
just had that experience in your head,

1105
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:27,660
you still have that experience and I
might as well have taken you to another

1106
01:03:27,661 --> 01:03:31,260
dimension. It might as well
because the same thing happened.

1107
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,740
You saw the same shit.
You felt the same things.

1108
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:39,360
You experienced the same things you saw
at all. It might not have been real,

1109
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,790
but it might've been real too.
It doesn't matter.

1110
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:46,470
You still experienced exactly the same
way as if it did take you to another

1111
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:50,160
planet and you did ride around the rings
of Saturday and your underwear. I mean,

1112
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:54,420
it really does take you to that place.
Yeah.

1113
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,860
So it might be real,

1114
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:58,110
it might take you to that place or it
might be all happening in your mind,

1115
01:03:58,111 --> 01:04:01,440
but either way you experienced
the exact same thing

1116
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,840
and it lasts. And the results there, you
know, that you get from it are actually,

1117
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,550
that was one of the cool things
about going to the maps conference,

1118
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:11,520
which is the Multidisciplinary
Association of Psychedelic Studies.

1119
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:15,510
They put on a conference in Oakland and
they had all of the top scientists from

1120
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:18,900
all these different fields of research
come and present their findings.

1121
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,620
So there's been over 80 patients,
clinically dose with Psilocybin.

1122
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:27,650
Most of them in palliative care easing
the anxiety of death towards the end of

1123
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:29,910
life.
Amazing dramatic stories.

1124
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:33,960
You have psychiatrists in there who'd
been working in this field for 40 years,

1125
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:38,910
seeing people and they, they're the ones
running these, uh, these programs. And,

1126
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,840
well, first of all, the funny part is
it's, it's a double blind trial, right?

1127
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,340
So it was on one case someone is getting
placebo which is doing nothing and

1128
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:50,040
another case they're getting
a heroic dose of Psilocybin.

1129
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,630
And the research is like,

1130
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:55,320
one of the problems with the study design
is we pretty much know because they're

1131
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:56,580
not supposed to know it's double blind.

1132
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:01,380
We pretty much know when someone's taken
a bunch of siliciden like it's not hard

1133
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:03,150
to tell when that's actually happened,

1134
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:07,650
but they're saying that what they're
accomplishing in three hours would take on

1135
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:11,820
them three years to do back in the
old paradigm and their reporting these

1136
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,830
findings and it's really encouraging.

1137
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:16,170
Obviously the Johns Hopkins
study was a great study.

1138
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:20,830
94% of people who took the psilocybin
said it was one of the top five most

1139
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:22,270
meaningful experience of their life.

1140
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,630
I mean really cool findings that are
leading to a potential legalization of

1141
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:33,850
psilocybin for clinical use and
shouldn't be just for clinical use.

1142
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,200
This is what's really fucked up.

1143
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,280
It's all these people that are having
all these thoughts and all these positive

1144
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:45,400
experiences like that,
that this is discounted by our government.

1145
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:50,920
Gish. It shows that were being run by
a bunch of infants like they should be

1146
01:05:50,921 --> 01:05:55,630
experiencing it too.
You should also do mushrooms as well.

1147
01:05:55,631 --> 01:05:59,770
Sir, are prerequisite, prerequisite
for political. This for sure.

1148
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,050
It's such a silly little thing. It gloat
grows and cow shit. It looks ridiculous.

1149
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:09,970
It sounds ridiculous. It
appears in fucking Mario
Brothers, Donkey Kong and shit,

1150
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:15,690
but it might be the thing that humanity
really could count on right now.

1151
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:21,360
It might be the thing if you could ensure
across the board experiences ensured

1152
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:24,970
them worldwide over a
week's period of time.

1153
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:29,410
You changed the world forever and that's
real. Yeah. You really would. One,

1154
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:34,470
one gigantic world trip where like 30%
of the population of the planet does

1155
01:06:35,001 --> 01:06:39,130
mushrooms. One day you want
to talk about a strange world.

1156
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:41,140
You would wake up to Monday morning.
Fuck yeah.

1157
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,520
I mean people would be
hugging people in the streets.

1158
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,580
This is a thought I've had recently.

1159
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:49,900
What if all of the churches instead of
just bickering about their own dogmas and

1160
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:52,420
all this stuff, I mean they're all
trying to get at the same spirit.

1161
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:56,320
What if they were all churches have
experience and across the war there was,

1162
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,040
you know,

1163
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:01,810
one basic church that you go to and that
church was a little bit of everything.

1164
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,660
In that church,
there was zen meditation in one area,

1165
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:06,460
there was float tanks in another area,

1166
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,660
there was lectures from people like
Graham Hancock coming through there.

1167
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:12,670
There was yoga in one spot.

1168
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:17,170
And then there is different ceremonial
areas where you could smoke pot and do,

1169
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,900
you know, do it dance out in uh, out in a
sweat lodge. Or You could take mushrooms,

1170
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:25,890
take mushrooms in a clinical, you
know, like a really relaxed, you know,

1171
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,160
encouraging setting.

1172
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:32,340
Or You could do an Iowasca ceremony with
the local Iowasca Maestro and all of

1173
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:34,210
that was available to you.
So you look,

1174
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:38,140
maybe you didn't go every week or every
Sunday, but when you needed to check in,

1175
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:41,830
there was your local church and you
could just kind of talk to some people,

1176
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:43,960
either listen,
maybe do some light yoga,

1177
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:48,280
or let's say you really needed to move
yourself and then go in and pop into an

1178
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:51,430
IOWASCA ceremony. Or let's say
you were feeling, you know,

1179
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:53,530
you got addicted to
something accidentally. Oh,

1180
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:58,300
well you could pop into the Boga treatment
ceremony that last through him Sunday

1181
01:07:58,301 --> 01:08:00,730
through Tuesday.
Real clinics like that.

1182
01:08:00,731 --> 01:08:02,950
There were run by people really
knew what they were doing.

1183
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,990
I could change the whole world,
the whole thing.

1184
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:07,720
The whole paradigm shifts at that
point, I think. And it's there.

1185
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:09,550
It's like a real thing.
That's what's crazy.

1186
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:12,190
It's not like something from
a doctor Seuss book, you know,

1187
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,650
that rhymes with you no more.
You know what I mean? Like, yeah,

1188
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:22,070
they took them off on top of the
org and traveled to a farm. I do.

1189
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:25,190
I am really encouraged by what,
um,

1190
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:28,100
what maps is doing because they're,

1191
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,850
they're playing by the rules and you
think that you get nowhere playing by the

1192
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:34,820
rules, but in some
encouraging results, both,

1193
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,970
both for Mbma for PTSD and
he's psilocybin studies,

1194
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,100
they're getting allowed to do the research
to complete these phase one trials

1195
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,660
and actually test them on human subjects
for the first time in a long time.

1196
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:52,160
And that's going to lead to bigger trials
in the phase two trials and the phase

1197
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,430
three and eventually there's going
to get drug approvals for these.

1198
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,010
Now why that is significant
is that that point,

1199
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:01,280
you have a massive amount of data.
You have side effects studied,

1200
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,660
you have clinical use study,

1201
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:06,470
and if you can prove that there is an
actual benefit to something, you know,

1202
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:09,620
it really weakens the
argument for criminalization.

1203
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:13,400
And then of course there's going
to be a lot of off label uses.

1204
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:16,280
Doctors who are like, look, this
is really helpful. You know,

1205
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:19,520
just kind of like what's happened
with medical marijuana a little bit.

1206
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,290
It's been medically legal,

1207
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,860
but pretty much that is the
gateway to legalization.

1208
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,890
But they're following the steps along the
path that could potentially allow this

1209
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:31,340
to be legal.

1210
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:35,210
There's that path and then there's the
religious freedom path and I think those

1211
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:39,950
are really the only two paths that are
going to lead to fruitful and effective

1212
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:43,280
policy change. Religious freedom
is a funny thing. It's just,

1213
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:48,340
I always feel like whenever someone
gets together in a big giant group and

1214
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:52,160
there's a few people running,
it shit goes bad. It's just,

1215
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:56,720
it seems very rare than anybody
can keep it together. You know?

1216
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,940
It all just turns a little.
I've been reading,

1217
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,350
I've been listening rather to a Dan
Carlin's hardcore history about Martin

1218
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:07,340
Luther and the the rise of the
Anabaptists in Munster, Germany,

1219
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,110
whenever some new dude comes along and
tries to change things and we're going to

1220
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,060
do it the right way, it's just how
God wanted it. It always goes bad.

1221
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:14,901
It always goes bad,

1222
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:17,300
but somebody gets in trouble and then
they start just because they realize they

1223
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,040
can fuck all the teenage girls

1224
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,530
and suddenly God tells him that that's
what they need to do. When this guy died,

1225
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:26,160
he had 16 wives.
Exactly.

1226
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,340
It's always the same and they just
chopped him apart with swords and shit and

1227
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,200
eventually got a hold of them.
You know what,

1228
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:36,230
the other thing I've been kind of
thinking about is too is you know,

1229
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:39,980
you assume that like some of these Iowasca
Schamens at bogus schamens different

1230
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:44,190
people. You would assume that by doing
those psychedelic drugs they would've

1231
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:45,440
straightened themselves out.

1232
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,320
They would have straightened
their morality out and
they'd be all good people.

1233
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:51,200
But that's certainly not
the case. You know, they,

1234
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:55,550
there are a lot of examples of these
people who are doing the medicine itself

1235
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,930
and are still completely
morally corrupt individuals.

1236
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,860
And I was just so weird. Yeah,
it is weird. But you know,

1237
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:06,150
I think ultimately the power of the mind,
you know,

1238
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,540
if you put your mind to it can supersede,
you know,

1239
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:11,480
at the potential of the medicine itself.

1240
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:16,470
So if you decide to it and just use
the feeling, it's almost like taking,

1241
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,770
you know, mushrooms
recreationally to watch a cartoon,

1242
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:24,890
you can kind of override the potential
spiritual value of it and just focus on

1243
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:29,760
laughter and seeing colors explode on a
screen in the same way that you can do

1244
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:33,960
it with morality where you can take
a bunch of Iowasca and then use that,

1245
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:39,260
override it still with your mind and
just use it to practice whatever kind of

1246
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:43,560
power mechanism you want. So you
gotta make sure you get, you know,

1247
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:47,130
just because they do a bunch of,
uh, well Huska or vogue or whatever,

1248
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,190
it doesn't mean they're good. You got
to find the people who are on that,

1249
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,840
that True Path,
the path of light.

1250
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:56,770
So you think what happens is
probably these people grow
up in this horrible area,

1251
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,540
you know,
third world country,

1252
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:03,280
really impoverished and they probably
find out about Iowasca as a way to make

1253
01:12:03,281 --> 01:12:07,120
money because there's an eye on WASC at
tourists trade aid. Even if they take it,

1254
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:11,010
maybe when you just reach a certain amount
of fucked up, there's no, no Poland.

1255
01:12:11,011 --> 01:12:13,450
You back to to civilization.
You know,

1256
01:12:13,451 --> 01:12:18,451
maybe the way the human body is programmed
to survive and horrible destitute

1257
01:12:18,731 --> 01:12:22,870
situations. Yeah, really, really
disgusting violent situations.

1258
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,110
The human body sort of designed to to,

1259
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:28,600
to be able to function
in those environments and
knows how to change and get

1260
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:32,740
wacky and crazy and it knows
how to deal with war. It adapts,

1261
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,340
adapts and that becomes the new reality
that becomes every day to day living now.

1262
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,640
And it just seems like when you go just
a certain distance down the cut whole,

1263
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,830
you know,
it's like there's no pulling you back.

1264
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,470
That's true. Or perhaps in, in other
cases I think it's happened, you know,

1265
01:12:48,471 --> 01:12:52,310
a lot of these traditions are taught
grandfather to grandson and I think the

1266
01:12:52,311 --> 01:12:55,160
grandchildren start off, you
know, on a pretty good path.

1267
01:12:55,161 --> 01:12:59,060
But then they get a taste of power.
Then they realize everybody in their area,

1268
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:02,900
if it's a tribe or if in their community
looks up to them and they have absolute

1269
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:05,660
power over these people,
and you put that amount,

1270
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:09,290
that mantle of power on people and
you'll see cracks develop. You know,

1271
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:11,630
you see it all over the place.
People who were once good,

1272
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,810
getting in power and
exposing these inner demons,

1273
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:19,070
these inner weaknesses that they have
and they choose instead of overcoming

1274
01:13:19,071 --> 01:13:20,600
those that choose to just go with it.

1275
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:25,930
I bet a lot of their downfall is chicks
from America with yoga pants come down

1276
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,500
there. And I'm just trying
to get spiritually clean.

1277
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:34,610
I'm just trying to open up my shockers
and just big juicy ass and yoga pants

1278
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:35,000
just,

1279
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,610
and she's in love with this dude because
he makes the magic brew and he knows

1280
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:41,480
how to call the dragon dump, dump, dump,
dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump.

1281
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:46,490
And she's in fucking seethrough yoga
pants. Do you know they just fix those.

1282
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:50,960
See through yoga pants? What took so
long? Think they should give them all out.

1283
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:52,220
That's the only fair thing to do.

1284
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:55,280
They should have shut the fuck
up is what they should have done.

1285
01:13:55,281 --> 01:13:57,410
You knew what you were doing.
You dirty freaks. Who? What?

1286
01:13:57,411 --> 01:13:59,820
Girl doesn't put those on and
get in front of a mirror. Yeah.

1287
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,690
Oh my God.
You can see everything.

1288
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,670
I can't wear these. Oh my
God. You can see everything.

1289
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,130
Should I wear these, if you would
you think wasn't I wore these.

1290
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,290
Oh my God. You can see it.
Can you see everything? Can
you, am I being picky? They,

1291
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,520
they talk themselves out of it.

1292
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:21,730
They know that their boxes just hanging
out there and a lot of these dirty

1293
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:26,731
freaks would go to yoga class with
nothing on just these yoga tights and

1294
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:31,440
literally you could read their
lips. You literally, there's,

1295
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:35,170
I said literally five times after I said,
I hate that I said it literally.

1296
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:39,760
You did fuck cunt cunt. Fuck yeah.

1297
01:14:39,761 --> 01:14:42,260
The only thing that this company
should do is just hand them out.

1298
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:46,430
They should just shut the fuck up.
They should just go radio silent selling,

1299
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,630
keep selling them and go
radio silent and they go,

1300
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:53,440
are these the these yoga pants
still see through? Just go, Huh,

1301
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,990
Huh, Huh, Huh. Yeah. It looks great
in, yeah, those are good for you.

1302
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:01,660
Go the dressing rooms over there if
you want to get changed or if they get

1303
01:15:01,661 --> 01:15:02,950
sweaty,
you can see through them.

1304
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:06,520
Just have a nice bright dressing room
so none of those freaks can try foul.

1305
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,580
Just let them steal it. I'm looking
at, look at your box in the mirror.

1306
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:12,070
That's wrong with that. That's a
little showing off a little block.

1307
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:15,260
How's that going to hurt anybody?
It'd be good for everybody. Yeah,

1308
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,020
that's what I'm saying.
Except schamens thing.

1309
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:22,540
They use those American Yoga freaks. They
used to a bunch of barefoot fishermen.

1310
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:25,690
Women. Yeah, it's true. I mean
too much. Too much to bear.

1311
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:30,940
It's milky white scan and a big juicy
booty and stretching out in the jungle

1312
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:33,900
floor. You just get yoga
pants. I find on roses,

1313
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,980
all the ones from Lulu lemon or
maybe invest in hyper color. I mean,

1314
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:40,630
I bet that's pretty cheap and it just is.

1315
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:44,920
And we put out Alpha tights
for guys to show their cocks.

1316
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:49,120
They'll still be the new, uh,
the new alpha thing. Alpha
tights. Everybody was like,

1317
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:51,010
why do I have to wear,
why do I have to wear underwear?

1318
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:53,440
I'm just gonna wear tights and dudes
who just wear tights everywhere,

1319
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,790
but they're see through tights.

1320
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:58,730
We could just really show your cock and
that becomes a new thing. Well look it,

1321
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,320
I would believe that would be the new
thing before it would ever believe that

1322
01:16:02,321 --> 01:16:06,070
there'd be dudes willing to pull their
pants down to their balls and then belt

1323
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:09,040
them in place there.
And you have your underwear hanging out.

1324
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:12,790
And if this would be like a super common
practice and then I'd be walking on the

1325
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:17,560
street and I'd see five 10 20 young men
with their fucking pants pulled down

1326
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:21,160
below the crack of their ass.
And I'm like, what are you doing?

1327
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,190
Do you know stupid?
This is so,

1328
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,680
I wouldn't believe that that
will be possible. And it
is. So I believe that the,

1329
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,250
the,
the cock tights,

1330
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,520
we'd be the shit was it from you that
we were talking about that that was part

1331
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:36,340
of prison culture.
And they don't have belts.

1332
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:37,680
You can't have belts cause
you can choke someone.

1333
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,570
Definitely you could kill yourself.
And so they would sag their pants.

1334
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:44,200
Easy access for their,
for their daddies to just bend them over.

1335
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:49,150
Well, the, the, the booty
master was that guy's name,

1336
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:53,020
the one got the booty bandit who
was in that aisle locked up show.

1337
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:56,170
You ever seen that show? No. You've never
seen that Brian. Please pull that up.

1338
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,520
Since we have this amazing Internet
connection now the booty booty bandit from

1339
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:04,750
locked up or they also call and the most
terrifying man on earth or something

1340
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:09,680
like that. But he was all talking
about dudes that are sagging, you know,

1341
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:09,980
and then he

1342
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,780
goes, to me, that's sexy. He's like that
sexy like you, you sang in front of me.

1343
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:19,330
Yeah. You find that this is a huh?

1344
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:22,920
This guys to fucking terrified it.
Kentucky state penitentiary.

1345
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:28,410
We met police jobs. The booty
warrior a long time. That's
what it costs him. Sorry.

1346
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:31,590
Different kinds of
homosexuality, right? Yeah,

1347
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,400
he does sexual dissolves,
right.

1348
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,720
Sean [inaudible] and a
warm place all along,

1349
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:45,120
get home or [inaudible] all they home
made a map warming [inaudible] and it say

1350
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:59,040
the most memorable story
that's police told us to look.

1351
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,810
That guy looks like the type of guy
that he would lock get his cell.

1352
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,910
Why don't they just fucked to death?

1353
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:07,900
Why don't they just sit in like returns
like flashlights are returns, you know,

1354
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,760
it was a good one.
Just send out a person.

1355
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:14,470
I did talk to the system and Moody.
They weren't, they weren't down with it.

1356
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:18,950
Um, more important. Boody was more
important than for a man, but,

1357
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:22,160
oh no, no. He had the first half. Correct.

1358
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:26,670
And the second half wrong.
It looked low. Booming.

1359
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,360
I ave to bullying.

1360
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,370
What's more important? Drank them. Wow.

1361
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:43,150
Oh my goodness. That's it. It's enough.
I've heard enough to boody warrior.

1362
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:47,680
I was listening to a,
I was listening to my buddy Donald shorts.

1363
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:51,070
He was out actually in Hayward.
They're chasing down rhino poachers,

1364
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:54,070
which was a pretty crazy experience
because they're going after these rhino

1365
01:18:54,071 --> 01:18:56,590
poachers that are killing these Ryan.
I was just cutting off the horn,

1366
01:18:56,591 --> 01:19:00,100
selling them to China to make Chinese
People's Dick's bigger supposedly,

1367
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:03,670
which is really all it is. It's all, it's
all, that's what they use it for. Yeah.

1368
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,760
That's the main thing they use it for
is they grind it up and put it in Dick

1369
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,390
Pills in China.

1370
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:11,740
And it's really the same thing that's in
your fingernails like it has. No, yeah,

1371
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:15,280
it has no actual properties that are
doing anything. But there's the big horn,

1372
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:18,690
big Dick. And I don't know if
it's, I apologize about my accent,

1373
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,590
but he didn't apologize. You would have
been fine problems. You didn't own it,

1374
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,223
but the uh,

1375
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:30,780
but whatever in that paradigm there as
one of the reasons for these riders going

1376
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:33,190
to kill it. So he goes out
there, it's crazy. They end up,

1377
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:36,580
they end up shooting this footage and
then as they're coming up on these

1378
01:19:36,581 --> 01:19:39,820
poachers, they get shot at.
Why, why? This is all on video.

1379
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,700
If you look up Donald Sholtz Rhino,
I don't know what you can find it,

1380
01:19:42,701 --> 01:19:46,630
but they get shot at by these poachers
and then you see him duck down like oh

1381
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:50,560
shit. And they're filming this and then
his people, his, his people pop up,

1382
01:19:50,561 --> 01:19:51,550
he's from South Africa,

1383
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,570
his people pop up with like eight ks
and just lay waste to where the poachers

1384
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,400
and the poachers have high powered rifles.
These guys have like assault rifles.

1385
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:04,240
Right. But they shot first Adam and
it's a shoot to kill policy apparently.

1386
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,970
But then they roll up on the poachers,
one of them is dead,

1387
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:10,220
one of them was wounded.
It's this crazy kind of scenario.

1388
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,710
But the poachers are in leagues
with the actual police in there.

1389
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:16,440
It's all there paying them off.
It's all part of the money system.

1390
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:18,030
So as they were leaving,

1391
01:20:18,031 --> 01:20:21,540
they get stopped by the police and
they're looking for footage of, you know,

1392
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:26,190
kind of what went down and they hid the
footage and I think some parachute bags

1393
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:29,520
or something like that. And
police are giving him hell
and they just go, you know,

1394
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,910
we're going to throw you in jail and
you're going to come out different.

1395
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,100
And what they meant by that was it,

1396
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:39,450
there's something called slow puncture
where they put you in a cell with another

1397
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:42,120
do with HIV,
and then he rapes you.

1398
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,330
And then they let you go after
he rapes you enough times.

1399
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,660
And then you go home and
you die of aids at home.

1400
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,890
And they call it slow puncture for people
that they can't actually press charges

1401
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:55,650
on. Whoa. But they want
to fuck you for life.

1402
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:57,990
And so there they were
threatening him with that,

1403
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,960
but they held the bluff
berm got the tapes out.

1404
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,350
And I've been trying to raise
awareness to, uh, to save the rhinos.

1405
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:08,750
But it's scary. It's scary.

1406
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:12,740
Slow puncture in an African prison sign.
Don't do it.

1407
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,860
Don't do it. How fucking terrifying. And
if you do, if you're about to get raped,

1408
01:21:17,861 --> 01:21:21,950
just fight for your goddamn
life. That's it. There's no,

1409
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,180
no point. We're going to war. Yeah, you're
going to war to the death. First Day.

1410
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:30,190
You probably gonna die. You may
die, most likely it's likely,

1411
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:34,630
but go out on your shield, son,
go out on your shield, son.

1412
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:40,370
Don't go to Africa. That's another one.
Imagine if Africa was the only place left.

1413
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:43,310
Imagine if there was some
crazy fucking catastrophe.

1414
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,390
Most of the world got wiped out except
the content Africa and we all hopped over

1415
01:21:47,391 --> 01:21:51,110
there and boats from all over the world
and battled it out for a chunk of the

1416
01:21:51,111 --> 01:21:55,970
Congo. Carve your stake in
Africa. The rest of the world,

1417
01:21:55,971 --> 01:21:58,970
just to waste just a giant wasteland,
a small,

1418
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,290
well Africa's Hmong population,

1419
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:05,360
you know all the people and influences
and all the bullshit, all the corruption.

1420
01:22:05,361 --> 01:22:06,194
That's fucked it up.

1421
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:09,560
There's a lot that's fuck through that
place and it's so fucked up in so many

1422
01:22:09,561 --> 01:22:13,490
ways. It's like, how do you bring
some Malia back? You know? Very true.

1423
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,950
How do you bring Liberia back?
How do you,

1424
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:20,250
how do you snap those back to
the standards of, you know,

1425
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:22,220
European cities like London?

1426
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,900
I Dunno.
I mean the corruption is so deep seated.

1427
01:22:24,901 --> 01:22:27,150
There's that problem and then there's the,
you know,

1428
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,340
kind of Middle East fundamentalists.

1429
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,130
Sure. It's, it's also like you,

1430
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:35,290
nobody has any desire to go and use
resources to help these poor people out.

1431
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:38,800
And these people who live in Liberia or
live in Somalia or live in any of their

1432
01:22:38,801 --> 01:22:40,300
really poor sections of Africa,

1433
01:22:40,301 --> 01:22:44,410
like they got a really shit roll
the dice location wise. They, they,

1434
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:49,580
they were born and incredibly impoverished
place and it's like there's gotta be

1435
01:22:50,381 --> 01:22:55,381
something that the rest of the world like
gotta like be honest about where these

1436
01:22:55,661 --> 01:22:57,970
people are. The rest of where
I was like, well, you know,

1437
01:22:57,971 --> 01:23:01,840
they can pull themselves up by their
bootstraps just like we did over here in

1438
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:05,800
Munich,
but now like the infrastructure of spots,

1439
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:09,780
it's like so much better to get
born in those spots. I mean,

1440
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,390
they're in the slums, you know,
you would see these shanty's,

1441
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:17,500
he's little shacks of basically sheet
metal and that's it. Sheet metal.

1442
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:20,520
And they kind of put it towards the
ground just to keep a little sun off of

1443
01:23:20,521 --> 01:23:24,460
their head and a little bit of shade in
the day. But they'd be on hills, right.

1444
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:26,340
And there's no septic system,
so they'd be on,

1445
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,340
so the people at the top of the hill

1446
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,030
just be going in the bathroom in their
huts and the sewage would just slide

1447
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:34,570
oh the rest of the places

1448
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,990
down and meet that. And you know,
disease was everywhere. You see.

1449
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,560
And it's a really intense,

1450
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:44,400
intense scenario and
generally a very good people.

1451
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:47,550
But one of the thing and very
cool people there that you meet,

1452
01:23:47,551 --> 01:23:48,610
but one of the problems is,

1453
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:53,250
is that there's so the best way
to get ahead in Africa right now,

1454
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:56,900
the way to get the most money is not
start a business, be an entrepreneur,

1455
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,290
create something. It's to get a grant. So
we have some of the, like the brightest,

1456
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:05,610
smartest Africans instead of
like trying to create businesses.

1457
01:24:05,611 --> 01:24:06,660
And of course some of them do.

1458
01:24:06,661 --> 01:24:10,530
But I noticed a lot of really the
smartest people I meet, we're coming,

1459
01:24:10,531 --> 01:24:14,700
trying to write grants and just trying
to get money instead of focusing on

1460
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,400
starting a business,
building something from the grass roots.

1461
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:21,990
So it's almost like some of the help that
we're providing is not really helping

1462
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,990
longterm. It's just their
gaming it, you know,

1463
01:24:24,991 --> 01:24:28,120
they're figuring out the game
and trying to get the money out.

1464
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,660
Well that is a fascinating aspect of
that Bot Africa is that, that's the,

1465
01:24:31,661 --> 01:24:36,070
the head, the Nigerians cameras. I mean
they're so famous. Nigerian scammers,

1466
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,770
like everybody has heard
about Nigerian scams.

1467
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:43,000
There's been so many of them and so
many of them were the dudes just get so

1468
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:46,870
duped. Like it's always like a guy
and they pretend that they're a girl.

1469
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:50,800
Then the gold out loud. Yeah. I
can't get the gold deer. So easy.

1470
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:54,340
It is to get gold anywhere.
Everybody will buy gold.

1471
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:58,720
So if anybody comes to you and says,
Hey, I just can't sell it as gold man,

1472
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,770
they're full of shit. And the other one
is they like to do the inheritance one.

1473
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,460
You even Harris, you have to
pay some legal fees, right?

1474
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,170
Just a few grand in legal fees
and the money's coming, bro.

1475
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,370
Fucking go to the craziest
thing you've ever seen.

1476
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:14,950
You never run out of money forever. Start
buying a house. I mean, you can use it.

1477
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,180
You don't even need a down payment.

1478
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:19,450
Just tell them about this and then
you'll just take money in the bank.

1479
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,470
Nigerian scammers,

1480
01:25:20,471 --> 01:25:24,940
I guess they just got like Super Desperado
a bunch of smart dudes and then just

1481
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:29,140
hopped in and started figuring out how
scam white people or they're not even

1482
01:25:29,141 --> 01:25:32,680
Nigerians and somebody else
just hopped on the fucking, oh,

1483
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:35,400
Nigerian scams are working,
let's do it. Right.

1484
01:25:35,401 --> 01:25:38,440
Like they didn't know shit about Nigeria.
They took it to the next level.

1485
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,090
They pretended to be Nigeria.
Right.

1486
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:45,190
But they're really like from
Sweden or some shit. Like go ahead.

1487
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,400
I was just going to say, speaking
of uh, Sweden or some shit,

1488
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:51,700
I was thinking of foreign countries where
this guy can go that leaked this, uh,

1489
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:56,260
the NSA documents who's a, he's
hiding, you know, this whole story.

1490
01:25:56,650 --> 01:26:00,340
They had more than other wiki
leaks. Kinda. Yeah, exactly.

1491
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,860
The one that showed us that the NSA

1492
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,820
has been following, uh,
every phone call on Verizon.

1493
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:12,080
So in collecting metadata about every,
every transaction you've had, every,

1494
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,730
every interaction that you've had,

1495
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:16,690
what do you think the ultimate end
game is for that? I guess it's,

1496
01:26:16,691 --> 01:26:19,370
if anybody you know is a problem,

1497
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,790
they can just go back to the records and
fuck you up. Right. Is that the idea?

1498
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:25,910
Cause they're not going to be able to
pour through that data and just pick on

1499
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:29,330
people because someone said, Oh yeah,
I'm going to smoke some weed or whatever.

1500
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:32,990
I mean I really don't think
that's the plan. I think
it's just they have it. Yeah.

1501
01:26:32,991 --> 01:26:35,890
Just in case they need to, I think,
yeah, that's the, I knock you down.

1502
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:38,020
It's not that they want
to invade your privacy,

1503
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:39,700
but that if you turn out to be a creep,

1504
01:26:39,701 --> 01:26:42,880
they want it to be really easy to
be able to pull out any data on you.

1505
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:45,310
The problem is that it's like,

1506
01:26:45,311 --> 01:26:49,990
so are welling in and you're giving
people this incredible power to peer into

1507
01:26:49,991 --> 01:26:54,510
People's privacy and you know, what do we
lose in return for that? Well we really,

1508
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:58,960
really, we lose all privacy because all
privacy when you're interacting with,

1509
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,170
unless you're talking in a, in
a closed room. And even then,

1510
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,570
like if you go into like foreign places,

1511
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:08,740
like literally like working on secret
shit, like you know embassies and stuff,

1512
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,200
they won't let you bring iPhones.
Do you know why?

1513
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:15,460
Because you can't take a battery out of
an iPhone. And Amber Lyon taught us that.

1514
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:17,830
Like she's gone in like when
she was working for CNN,

1515
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:20,920
she'd do these like big time interviews
and she would have to get an android

1516
01:27:20,921 --> 01:27:23,800
phone so they could take the battery
out cause they want, don't want anybody,

1517
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:27,310
otherwise I can have that thing working
remotely and they can spy on you.

1518
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,290
I mean all that technology is available.

1519
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:33,220
They could just set your phone off while
you're hanging it out in your office,

1520
01:27:33,221 --> 01:27:36,390
planning your dastardly attack
on Gotham city, you know,

1521
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,270
with your fucking superhero friends or
whatever and they can record it all.

1522
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,420
You know,
that would,

1523
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:47,600
that would be less scary if every law
in the u s was perfectly just right.

1524
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,610
You know,
there was only just laws.

1525
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:54,330
You're allowed to experiment with your
own consciousness, you know, whatever.

1526
01:27:54,331 --> 01:27:57,780
All of these other financial
system has to get cleaned up first.

1527
01:27:57,810 --> 01:28:00,930
But imagine that, I mean, all the shit
that we're worried about, what are,

1528
01:28:00,931 --> 01:28:03,330
what are we worried about?
We're worried about I smoking weed.

1529
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,460
I guess someone could fuck you up.
Maybe if you would have,

1530
01:28:05,461 --> 01:28:07,410
if you're being unfaithful
to your girlfriend,

1531
01:28:07,411 --> 01:28:10,200
but it shouldn't be doing that
shit anyways. But you know,

1532
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:12,360
that's something that it's still,
it's nobody's business.

1533
01:28:12,361 --> 01:28:16,380
But if at least the laws were just, then
it wouldn't be such a pain in the ass.

1534
01:28:16,381 --> 01:28:20,190
But because we have all these unjust laws
where we can be thrown in jail for an

1535
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:24,420
indefinite period of time, you know? Well,
those two kind of scary for everybody.

1536
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:25,640
Those two things you brought up to,

1537
01:28:25,641 --> 01:28:30,480
she'd have absolutely nothing to do with
the law in fidelity or marijuana or is

1538
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:34,070
it nothing to do with the law should
be all about protecting people,

1539
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,520
protecting people from violence,
protecting people from theft,

1540
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,120
protecting people from injustice and,

1541
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:45,170
and ensuring a harmonious
community and that,

1542
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:46,490
you know,
that's really what it should,

1543
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,150
all the laws where you'd be pumped to see
the cops, how sweet the cops are here.

1544
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:53,870
Awesome. They're going to keep
everything safe. You know,

1545
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:57,610
instead of me like I'm on
the or stop creeping. Well,
you know, I've been really,

1546
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,340
like I said it,

1547
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,390
listen to this Dan Carlin podcasts.

1548
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,960
I've listened to dozens of them over
the last couple of weeks and it's,

1549
01:29:04,961 --> 01:29:09,360
it's amazing how good we have it today
just compared to like the 15 hundreds

1550
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:13,350
like the way the people were living
just 500 plus years ago. It's just,

1551
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:16,440
it's total insanity.
Total insanity. We would,

1552
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:19,020
we have been hell if we're
forced to be back there.

1553
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,240
It was such a short period of time ago.

1554
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:25,730
It's like we without a doubt there's
a lot of room for improvement in this

1555
01:29:25,731 --> 01:29:27,000
society and its culture,

1556
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:32,360
but we're seeing an awareness right in
front of our eyes that I'm not even sure

1557
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:37,701
if we've totally understood the impact
of it yet because what you're seeing with

1558
01:29:38,011 --> 01:29:40,920
like this NSA leak thing and wiki leaks,

1559
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:46,070
you're seeing this forced
response in this grand global way.

1560
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:51,270
Like they have to respond to these things
in a global way like the whole UK is,

1561
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:55,530
they were writing articles about it in
newspapers are writing articles about it.

1562
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,010
Hong Kong. The fact that this guy was
on the run, the FBI's looking for them.

1563
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:04,130
This is a worldwide publicity disaster
for the NSA and it's been created by one

1564
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:11,280
person who took a stand and now they're
going after that person as if he's some

1565
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:14,790
sort of a terrorist. One
person that showed that, hey,

1566
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:18,810
you guys are kind of violating the
constitution. Like what's going on here?

1567
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:20,880
Do we have a constitution anymore?
Oh No,

1568
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:25,230
this NDA thing that you've fucks past
that sort of bypass the constitution.

1569
01:30:25,231 --> 01:30:29,910
So now all this illegal shit or that
used to be illegal, you made it legal.

1570
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:32,730
So you think you're doing an okay job.
Is that what's going on here?

1571
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:35,820
This is clearly bad.
Governing is clearly,

1572
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
and I think that transparency is being
exhibited in like this reaction to this

1573
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:43,770
NSA whistleblower thing where people,
you know,

1574
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:46,140
like the president's can
having to defend it now.

1575
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,530
And one of the things he was saying,
I was just talking about this to Dunkin,

1576
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,410
we were talking about how Obama was like,
you know,

1577
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:55,230
well this is something we should
definitely have a debate about. We can,

1578
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,750
I'm definitely open to talking
about this will really,

1579
01:30:57,751 --> 01:31:01,650
well why was it a secret then? Yeah.
Why did somebody have to leak this?

1580
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,800
Why didn't you discuss this with people
and explain the pros and cons of losing

1581
01:31:07,111 --> 01:31:12,090
this much secrecy of losing this
much privacy. That's ridiculous.

1582
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:15,360
That's [inaudible]. There's, there's
not that many threats to this world.

1583
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:18,960
I don't buy it. I think they're doing
a great job and shutting down threats.

1584
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:22,530
If you stop and look at how many threats
and they've turned into actual terror

1585
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:26,250
attacks besides the Boston one and
besides a couple of other ones,

1586
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,910
there's very few,
very few there.

1587
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:31,410
When you compare them to
actual days of the week,

1588
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:34,980
you compare them to actual human
interactions that take place throughout 50

1589
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:38,430
states and numerous cities all
throughout the day, all over the time.

1590
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:41,640
There's very few like those
shitheads from Boston.

1591
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,220
There's very few like you know,

1592
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:49,221
whether it's a a nine 11 that happened
in 2001 or cause they can squash most of

1593
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:54,360
them without reading every fucking email
you saying they shouldn't be able to

1594
01:31:54,361 --> 01:31:57,630
read everybody shit. That's
ridiculous. You know,

1595
01:31:57,631 --> 01:32:00,340
I think if you could
prove that you were just,

1596
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:03,460
and that you were looking out
for the best interest of man,

1597
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:08,790
maybe you should be able to go and like
look into this stuff without a warrant.

1598
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:14,350
But because it's been proven like the
IRS goes after conservative tea party

1599
01:32:14,351 --> 01:32:18,010
groups like mark much more than they
go after liberal people. They like,

1600
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:19,270
they just got busted for doing that.

1601
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:23,380
Like chasing down these tea party Fox and
making their life hell harassing them,

1602
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:28,300
like making their, their, their experience
with paying their, they're just taxes.

1603
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:29,170
Much more diff

1604
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:32,470
gold. Well the beauty is is
that the age of information,

1605
01:32:32,471 --> 01:32:37,420
the Internet is allowing all of these
people to band together and make a force

1606
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:39,310
on their own.
But it's back in the day.

1607
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:42,970
Imagine if you had to gather a large
group of people, you know, have,

1608
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:44,140
you couldn't do it.

1609
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:47,830
You have to put out an ad and then
you'd have to get that ad approved by

1610
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:49,900
whatever newspaper you were going to do.
I mean,

1611
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:54,670
or find a reputable news outlet that
you could go tell your story too.

1612
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:56,170
But now with the Internet,

1613
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,500
these things can spread and these things
can gather and people can communicate

1614
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:04,740
and that's a force that I don't think the
powers that be are fully comprehending

1615
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:06,250
and are ready to reckon with

1616
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:10,340
Dianne Feinstein was explaining that we
needed to do these things because uh,

1617
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,830
we need to stop terrorism. And
she was, when she was saying this,

1618
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:17,250
I was imagining that this
person gets to speak for me.

1619
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:20,010
I was imagining like the
ridiculousness of this,

1620
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:23,580
this person getting to speak for me,
this silly person who,

1621
01:33:23,581 --> 01:33:26,370
if there was a couple of us and she
started talking to me, be like, okay,

1622
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,420
stop talking. You're talking nonsense.
Like you're talking nonsense.

1623
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:33,330
If she was just around us right now and
she was explaining why that would be

1624
01:33:33,331 --> 01:33:36,690
important, she would look like a
buffoon within a couple of minutes time.

1625
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,230
She would be stammering.
It would be a disaster. It.

1626
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:44,310
There's no argument there and there's not
a single argument that you could point

1627
01:33:44,311 --> 01:33:48,690
to where a competent society that cares
about its citizens and he cares about

1628
01:33:48,691 --> 01:33:52,590
the quality of life,
which includes respect for your privacy,

1629
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:58,010
that that culture would allow these ass
fucks to just download every email you

1630
01:33:58,921 --> 01:34:02,130
send. Dunkin had a great way of
describing it today. He said,

1631
01:34:02,131 --> 01:34:05,790
could you imagine if the
government in the 1960 said, hey,

1632
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:07,650
everybody that sends a
letter through the mail,

1633
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:11,190
we're going to take it and xerox it
and then we're not going to read it,

1634
01:34:11,191 --> 01:34:13,830
but we're going to have it and then we're
going to send it back to you and we're

1635
01:34:13,831 --> 01:34:18,090
going to just keep all your letters in
a storage facility in Utah. If you like,

1636
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:22,200
get the fuck Outta here. You know how to
get to read my letters. Why do you need,

1637
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:26,730
you're just because when a person calls
themselves a cops or the CIA or the FBI,

1638
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:28,410
they put themselves into
some sort of a group.

1639
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:32,010
Now suddenly they believe they have
power that a regular person doesn't have

1640
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,990
because it was only two
people on the planet.

1641
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:37,200
You and Mister FBI guy
and Mr Fbi guys like,

1642
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:40,260
I believe you might be plotting terrorism.
So I'm going to read your emails,

1643
01:34:40,261 --> 01:34:44,310
your emails to who you fuck is this you
and me? No, you can't read my email.

1644
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:47,040
Get outta here. Go Fuck
Yourself. You're just a person.

1645
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:52,550
But when you're in a group and you're
the NSA or the CIA or the FBI or any

1646
01:34:52,711 --> 01:34:54,900
fucking other three letters,
you want to string together,

1647
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:59,690
all of a sudden you have the to go
and do really rude shit to people,

1648
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,320
you know, and that, that's the
problem with the big groups and

1649
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:08,210
rude by throwing them in jail. And it
definitely, I mean beyond, right? I mean,

1650
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:11,630
it's rude. It's hurting. Your
girlfriend reads your phone, text,

1651
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:14,210
even if you haven't done
anything wrong. You know, it's,

1652
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:18,350
it's rude when people dig into
people's fast. It's a, I mean I write,

1653
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:23,540
I write in journals and things like that
and one of like the most sacred things

1654
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:28,751
to me is that nobody picks
those motherfuckers up
because if somebody goes in

1655
01:35:28,911 --> 01:35:30,080
and reads that journal,

1656
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:33,320
that means that every time I'm
riding my innermost thoughts,

1657
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,960
there's going to be a little
sensor voice up there saying,

1658
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,910
oh well what if somebody reads this shit?

1659
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:40,940
I better not write this exactly how it is.

1660
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:44,150
As soon as that sensor voice comes on,
the whole,

1661
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:47,000
the whole practice of writing
in the journalist, fuck.

1662
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:50,150
That's why you shut up and write
in a journal after you beat off.

1663
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:54,410
That way you're at your most honest
really didn't know you're a piece of shit.

1664
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:56,563
Spell it out.

1665
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,310
Got Out of a situation
where somebody did that.

1666
01:35:59,311 --> 01:36:03,630
You know where somebody went in my phone
and screen shot it every single text I

1667
01:36:03,631 --> 01:36:07,890
have every single photo, every singe
thing and send it to themselves and that,

1668
01:36:07,891 --> 01:36:10,010
that now questions me
when I talked to anybody.

1669
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,470
Cause even if it's something legit,

1670
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:14,730
I don't even want to type it
down anymore because of that.

1671
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:17,520
I mean there's like that program
that's popular right now.

1672
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:21,720
Snapchat where you send a photo and
then it expires in three seconds of your

1673
01:36:21,721 --> 01:36:22,554
balls and stuff.

1674
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,290
People found out a way to hack that and
now so you can go in there and take all

1675
01:36:25,291 --> 01:36:27,930
those photos and all those videos
that are supposed to be gone forever.

1676
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,790
Very well. All you have
to do, there's so silly.

1677
01:36:29,791 --> 01:36:32,480
All you have to do is have two
phones, right? And you took a photo,

1678
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:36,280
a photo of the photo and that way you
don't even have to get a screenshot of the

1679
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:36,541
game.

1680
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:41,310
There was so many to week game that we
gave this sweet Dinah shots that you just

1681
01:36:41,311 --> 01:36:41,690
sense it.

1682
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:45,030
All these motherfuckers are playing
tic TAC toe and there's no girls with

1683
01:36:45,031 --> 01:36:49,230
workable vaginas that we're going
to send good pictures anyway.

1684
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:52,530
It's all the game's terrible.
It's a terrible game.

1685
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:54,620
But that is something
that is scary though.

1686
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:57,440
If you think about texting
is so popular nowadays,

1687
01:36:57,441 --> 01:37:00,020
you don't realize what you're
typing the people, right?

1688
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:03,740
Like you're typing secrets that only you
and that person supposed to know. Right.

1689
01:37:03,741 --> 01:37:06,880
You know,
and then like six months later the NSA,

1690
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:10,940
you lose your phone or you lose your
phone, you're like, oh look at this guy.

1691
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:15,460
What he's talking about. Oh look at this.
Oh you don't think a shit like that?

1692
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,100
You should make your journal.
You should,

1693
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:21,600
you should like write it in like a very
specific like do you have those, um,

1694
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:26,460
you know those a scholastic
white and black book covers,

1695
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:31,140
it's like that was weird pattern that
they had and it was a hard cover TV.

1696
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:34,050
Well you should only write in those,
right?

1697
01:37:34,051 --> 01:37:38,730
And write my journal and then make up
a dummy one with one of those ink bombs

1698
01:37:38,731 --> 01:37:42,750
like they have for bags that they give
away and during the bank robberies and

1699
01:37:42,751 --> 01:37:47,630
once you open somebody
ship whammy, right? Yeah,

1700
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:51,900
yeah.
Green with envy and rotten desire,

1701
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:56,160
but you fucking green fuck head all.
I like dirty

1702
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,660
green,
like a rotten stinking green or not.

1703
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:03,990
Don't write ridiculous shit paper
and leave it around your house.

1704
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:06,370
If I was staying over your house,
I'm probably fucking read it.

1705
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,840
If I want to use your bathroom
and I took a leak and it was like,

1706
01:38:09,841 --> 01:38:13,650
what is this motherfucker writing on
the shitter reading? And you're like,

1707
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,620
why are you still in there
man? Oh Dude, I'm constipated.

1708
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:19,830
And then you realize that your book is
in there and I'm reading your book most

1709
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:23,600
likely. Yeah, don't leave your back. Don't
leave your journal in the shitter. Yeah,

1710
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:24,810
but I ain't going to cut it.

1711
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:30,650
I only have books in the shitter if I'm
not taking my cal shakes because if I,

1712
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:34,650
if I'm on a regular Kale shake
program, the job done, I always,

1713
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:39,680
the way I describe it is like a tunnel
and then those zombies from world war Z

1714
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:44,880
or running down down the tunnel,

1715
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:48,030
just all stacking on top of each other.
That's what the Kale shake is.

1716
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:53,190
It just fills up your entire
pipe with a thick green,

1717
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,180
gooey substance.

1718
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:58,620
Cause I down about 30 ounces and then
those motherfuckers just push everything

1719
01:38:58,621 --> 01:39:03,420
out and it's a wild ride.
That's what, yeah man. You
know what dude? I told you we,

1720
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:07,740
I'm someone on the message board actually
found out how much of that shit is in

1721
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:10,740
Kale. Right. As opposed to other
things. Salary has more than Kale.

1722
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:14,430
The doctor said that while he was here.
I don't know,

1723
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,790
I feel good but the Dave Asprey,

1724
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:23,220
how dare you. But he said that on the
podcast but it's still has a lot in it.

1725
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:24,570
I don't think he said that.

1726
01:39:24,571 --> 01:39:28,950
I think he said salary had last actually
he was whoever the corrected them

1727
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:32,310
online. Apparently they corrected
them. What he said was incorrect.

1728
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:34,380
It's just a mistake whatever he said.

1729
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:39,060
But the way to combat that apparently
that's effective is calcium and adding

1730
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:43,290
calcium to your Kale shake. It's supposed
to offset the effects of any of that.

1731
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:45,540
Take your nightly TPC.
It's got it in there.

1732
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:49,410
But what I was going to say is people
discount how you know the feedback that

1733
01:39:49,411 --> 01:39:51,120
you're getting from your body yourself.

1734
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,390
You know like you feel good when
you have a Kale shake, right?

1735
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:57,960
Like you can feel it. Like if there
was something poisonous in that,

1736
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,530
I really trust that the body would
be like, Yo, you know, don't drink,

1737
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,500
don't drink this. He feels good
eggs, regular pussy. No it doesn't.

1738
01:40:04,501 --> 01:40:08,610
It's supposed to be really warm. But
you know, I mean people, it's the same.

1739
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:12,480
I mean you can apply that same if you're
really kind of pay attention to those

1740
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:16,380
signals coming back, you can
learn a lot from that. And
that's, you know, with this,

1741
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:16,580
you know,

1742
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:19,800
the earth grown nutrients thing that
Mike dolce is always preaching about.

1743
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,910
You can tell the difference and then you
get these weird kind of ideas. I mean,

1744
01:40:23,911 --> 01:40:26,550
I like a lot of the aspree
principles about high fat,

1745
01:40:26,551 --> 01:40:30,510
but if you take some of that stuff too
literally and start hammering like lots

1746
01:40:30,511 --> 01:40:34,800
of butter and you just don't feel
that great all the time, you know?

1747
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:38,400
But if you're following a more kind of
common sense and just listening to the

1748
01:40:38,401 --> 01:40:40,140
feedback from your body,
it,

1749
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,490
I tend to trust that more just kind
of feeling what feels good. Yeah.

1750
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:47,790
But it's also good to have some real
science and knowledge behind it to which

1751
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:52,580
act for sure. Asprey, he takes a lot
of heat but he knows a lot of shit.

1752
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,310
It's not a professional,

1753
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:58,330
so if he gets something wrong occasionally
you got to realize that guy also runs

1754
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:02,290
like an it company and people are always
like accusing him of trying to hawk his

1755
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:05,650
items, which he definitely is like
over bulletproofing everything.

1756
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:09,790
I asked him if he had a bulletproof wife
goes home to his bulletproof marriage

1757
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:13,930
and as bulletproof sex, he's just, you
know, he's just, he's starting a business.

1758
01:41:13,931 --> 01:41:15,910
He's got getting ideas,
great ideas,

1759
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:21,180
but the point is like that guy had free
shit up on his website for a long time.

1760
01:41:21,371 --> 01:41:26,170
There's still a ton of free information.
The Greeley in detail,

1761
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,680
excellent stuff that he's pulled down.
He has references,

1762
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:31,990
he tells you where he read it,
he tells you what it's about.

1763
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:34,510
He tells you what the benefits
of these certain things are.

1764
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:39,310
It's really good stuff. And
I know that his, like his,

1765
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,270
his thing, his truck, he's like,

1766
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:45,730
he's on a quest to try to figure out
the ultimate combination of foods and

1767
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:49,150
exercises and treatments for
it to rehabilitate injuries.

1768
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:53,560
And he's right about a lot of shit.
Like he me gave me a great tip on that.

1769
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:58,600
Prolozone therapy for back issues. This
fucking tremendous. It's tremendous.

1770
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:02,590
It's got a lot of real wacky idea.
It's bulletproof coffees. Genius Shit.

1771
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,360
That's a genius invention.

1772
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,150
It's another one of those things
where you can really feel it.

1773
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:07,841
Yeah.
Well the,

1774
01:42:07,841 --> 01:42:12,190
the combining it with fats so that it's
a slow release of caffeine. That's,

1775
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:16,060
that's what coffee always needed. That's
what coffee was missing all this time.

1776
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:20,410
Yeah. That fucking jolt that you get
when you down like a 20 ounce Starbucks.

1777
01:42:20,411 --> 01:42:23,110
It's black.
You get that weird shaky like,

1778
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:26,920
oh fuck this little druggy
feeling so much, man.

1779
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:30,100
Yeah, but put some butter in there,
put some coconut oil, some MCT.

1780
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:30,940
It changes the game.

1781
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:35,290
Yeah. But just slow that slow
release. That's wonderful.

1782
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:38,240
You know what else has really
changed the game for me?

1783
01:42:38,241 --> 01:42:42,680
And maybe I'll tell my whole hunting
story to hear if we want to get into it.

1784
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:43,940
But yeah, I've, uh, you know,

1785
01:42:43,941 --> 01:42:47,690
I went out on that hunt down
in south Texas and you know,

1786
01:42:47,691 --> 01:42:52,691
we got a lot of meat back from that hunt
and every single time I have that meat

1787
01:42:53,121 --> 01:42:56,120
as compared to some other meat,
I mean,

1788
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:59,930
the way that I feel it digest
the way that I feel it absorbing,

1789
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,190
it's completely different.
Yeah.

1790
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:06,530
Castiel is completely different than
even if you're buying some kind of grass

1791
01:43:06,531 --> 01:43:11,480
fed cow steak, this wild game that we
went out and procured ourselves. I mean,

1792
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:12,770
it's not only delicious.

1793
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:16,310
I mean everything we've had has been
pretty fucking good. Maybe one dud,

1794
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:18,860
but most of the stuff
we're making Fajitas,

1795
01:43:18,861 --> 01:43:23,861
we're making stew or making tacos or make
it steaks or making stir fries and all

1796
01:43:24,381 --> 01:43:27,500
of this making me hungry.
It's been amazing.

1797
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:30,170
But that was a really cool experience
and it may be something that we've,

1798
01:43:30,230 --> 01:43:33,710
I know we've talked about doing
something like that for on it, so,

1799
01:43:33,711 --> 01:43:37,910
so really how it could potentially work
and it's a challenging scenario. So,

1800
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:40,340
you know, hopefully we're working,
just know that we're working on it.

1801
01:43:40,341 --> 01:43:43,910
Guys potentially make this possible
because I think the health benefits are

1802
01:43:43,911 --> 01:43:48,140
there and the whole process is really
valuable because if you've gone your whole

1803
01:43:48,141 --> 01:43:49,910
life,
and I know you've made this pitch to,

1804
01:43:49,911 --> 01:43:53,600
but if you've gone your whole and all
you do is show up to the grocery store,

1805
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:58,780
pick some cellophane wrapped piece of
meat that all you identify as as a steak.

1806
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:01,130
You know,
you really don't get it.

1807
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,840
You really don't understand even what
you're doing. You don't. Yeah. You know,

1808
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:08,990
you don't fully get it until you've
been there inside the animal, you know,

1809
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:12,440
arms up to your arms,
covered in blood,

1810
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:16,700
actually cutting those pieces of
meat out of something you've killed,

1811
01:44:16,701 --> 01:44:19,510
that changes your reality,
you know,

1812
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,110
then you have a full appreciation
for what you're doing. So,

1813
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:27,110
so what we did out there in south
Texas is there's these ranches,

1814
01:44:27,111 --> 01:44:31,760
this one was 10,000 acres.
And so there is a confined space.

1815
01:44:31,761 --> 01:44:34,310
It has 10,000 acres,
but these animals are procreating.

1816
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:38,240
They just kind of loosely measuring
the herds because they're mostly wild.

1817
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:43,760
The problem with hunting most native
game is there's very select seasons in

1818
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:47,090
which you're allowed to hunt them.
So you have to really kind of stock up.

1819
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:48,320
If you're going to hunt Whitetail,

1820
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,330
you better be in October
and you better have books,

1821
01:44:51,331 --> 01:44:54,410
some shit in advance or go
somewhere that's very small seasons.

1822
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:57,710
So what these exotic ranches have done,
if it's non native game,

1823
01:44:57,711 --> 01:45:02,480
you're allowed to basically take animals
from the herd all throughout the year.

1824
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:06,110
So they've gotten species of animals
from different parts of the world and

1825
01:45:06,111 --> 01:45:10,370
they're just, you know, that
country's version of the
deer. So there's fallow deer,

1826
01:45:10,371 --> 01:45:13,790
which come from Europe.
There's some blackbuck which come,

1827
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:17,690
I think they're from Indonesia,
tiger food. There's some access deer,

1828
01:45:17,691 --> 01:45:21,350
which also come from around that area.
Blackbuck might be somewhere else, but,

1829
01:45:21,351 --> 01:45:24,500
and then there's oryx and addicts and
all these different kinds of antelope and

1830
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:27,280
deer that they get and
they're just living there,

1831
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,180
living it up out in south Texas,

1832
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:33,710
the plants down there have roughly 30%
protein and even though they're sparse,

1833
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,640
they have pretty good, adequate protein.
And when there is kind of a drought,

1834
01:45:37,641 --> 01:45:40,520
they do supplement it with
a little extra food as well.

1835
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:44,450
But they're pretty much just living off
the land and thriving and procreating.

1836
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:49,160
And so you're going down there and not
only is it like a cool safari where

1837
01:45:49,161 --> 01:45:50,930
you're seeing all these exotic creatures,

1838
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:55,850
you're actually able to go out and take
your rifle and hop out on some sticks or

1839
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:59,210
you know, track 'em down in
these kind of outdoor vehicles,

1840
01:45:59,211 --> 01:46:03,920
which are like these commando
style suburbans and go
hunting for an animal that

1841
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:07,070
you are going to take then and
butcher and have meat for. Man,

1842
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:10,760
I've been eating the same deer
for like three months now.

1843
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:15,800
So it's a really fucking cool experience
where you're out there in land and

1844
01:46:15,801 --> 01:46:20,600
these animals are, you know, ostensibly
as wild as, as other animals.

1845
01:46:20,601 --> 01:46:23,690
I mean they're not sensitized to
the truck. A few of the species are,

1846
01:46:23,691 --> 01:46:26,630
they get kind of used to the truck and
that would be a little weird to shoot.

1847
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:28,220
But these black box,
I mean,

1848
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:32,450
I was out there hunting for the entirety
of the day and I was really didn't

1849
01:46:32,451 --> 01:46:35,030
think I was going to get one. You
know, I was hoping to get one,

1850
01:46:35,031 --> 01:46:38,030
but I kind of said, you
know, all right, if,

1851
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,820
if today's not the right day
to take an animal, so be it.

1852
01:46:40,821 --> 01:46:45,821
So rock cruising around in every animal
that came within about 250 yards was

1853
01:46:46,131 --> 01:46:48,950
just scattering.
And I knew the ballistics on my,

1854
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:53,940
I wasn't going to comfortably
take a shot that was over about,

1855
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:55,830
you know,
one 50 to one 80,

1856
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:59,100
just because at that point my
particular ballistics on the bullet,

1857
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:01,560
the bullet was going to drop
about four to six inches.

1858
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:04,500
And I didn't really have to
gauge that to gauge that.

1859
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:07,860
But one of those goggles that you look
through and it gives you the number. No,

1860
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,990
I didn't have that. So
it was all by, you know,

1861
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:11,610
we had a guide there and he'd be like,
yeah,

1862
01:47:11,611 --> 01:47:16,290
that's about one in
one 91 90 get her done.

1863
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:19,890
So, um, so anyway, so we finally,
it's a very end of the day.

1864
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:22,350
I didn't think I was going
to get anything and uh,

1865
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:27,650
we see this blackbuck doe at the very
top of hill about 260 yards away and

1866
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:30,510
instead of scattering I was like,
oh great,

1867
01:47:30,511 --> 01:47:33,780
she's just gonna run away like everything
else does instead of scattering away.

1868
01:47:33,781 --> 01:47:36,930
It ran like right towards
the truck for 80 yards.

1869
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,000
So it was like at 160,

1870
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:41,880
and this is like right when the
sun was kind of starting set.

1871
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:46,140
Definitely the last chance I had.
So I made like a quick makeshift brace,

1872
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:48,630
sod in the cross hairs,

1873
01:47:48,631 --> 01:47:52,980
tried to steady my heartbeat pounding
and try to keep the cross hairs from

1874
01:47:52,981 --> 01:47:54,330
dancing all over the thing,

1875
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:59,420
seeing sky seeing ground and then focus
in and take a deep breath and then it

1876
01:47:59,491 --> 01:48:03,950
just kind of turn just the right way
and I pulled the trigger, you know,

1877
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,800
big blast and then it was just
full adrenaline from there.

1878
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:09,270
I saw it rear up in the air,

1879
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:14,430
fell to the ground and I remember running
up to it because I knew that if it was

1880
01:48:14,431 --> 01:48:17,820
in pain they say to kind of
wait and see if it gets up.

1881
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:19,140
I wasn't really down with that.

1882
01:48:19,141 --> 01:48:22,830
I wanted to make sure that if it was
there that I could, you know, ease.

1883
01:48:22,831 --> 01:48:24,720
It's suffering as quickly as possible.

1884
01:48:24,721 --> 01:48:27,210
So I just dropped the
gun and went up there.

1885
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:29,700
I knew I hit it pretty
good and sprinted up.

1886
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:33,870
Why'd you jump the gun and just,
it was heavy and clumsy. I,

1887
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:37,980
well I had a knife on my one night
I had a knife in my, on my side.

1888
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:41,100
So you're going to do it in lifestyle.
You weren't going to use the gun? No.

1889
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:44,400
Well cause the gun can spoil meat.
Right? If you miss with a gun,

1890
01:48:44,401 --> 01:48:47,550
you could hit a shoulder which is going
to be 10 pounds of meat. You could,

1891
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:50,750
you know, miss and clips and
back. You could, you know,

1892
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:53,580
really the cleanest way to
do it to preserve the meat,

1893
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:56,130
which is why you're doing it
so you can kill less animals.

1894
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:58,830
Is with the knife to be honest.

1895
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:00,660
Do you were excited about
killing it with a knife?

1896
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,870
There's something telling you
right now that's creeping me out.

1897
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:09,030
I'm thinking of you going to stray
caveman fighting an ear or you saw him.

1898
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:11,041
Well,
I'll tell you,

1899
01:49:11,041 --> 01:49:13,890
I'll tell you all of the emotions that
went through really at that point.

1900
01:49:13,891 --> 01:49:18,420
So just leave out Horny, right? That
didn't, that didn't cross the path. So,

1901
01:49:18,421 --> 01:49:21,500
you know, I mean, so we ran
a ran up there and you know,

1902
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:24,240
obviously your heart's pounding
and it's a really weird experience.

1903
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:27,300
And I go up and I see it
and it was still alive,

1904
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:29,730
but it was probably bleeding out.
It was definitely bleeding out.

1905
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:32,970
I caught a piece of the heart,
a lot of lung and uh,

1906
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,970
it was definitely bleeding out, but I
wanted to make sure that it didn't suffer.

1907
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:37,980
But at the point that I got up there,

1908
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:43,050
the feeling wasn't any feeling of like,
you know,

1909
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:47,530
it was nothing but just pure gratitude
and appreciation for this animal.

1910
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:51,910
And I put my hand on his neck and
pulled the knife out and just, you know,

1911
01:49:51,911 --> 01:49:56,080
actually a very special knack to me is
one that my uncle gave to me before he

1912
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:59,020
passed away. And, and I, you know,

1913
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:04,590
put my hand on its neck and quiet and
myself and then put it into the heart and

1914
01:50:04,661 --> 01:50:08,770
I could feel the heart
reverberating through the blade
of the knife into my hand.

1915
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,420
Whoa.

1916
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:13,210
And I pulled it out and just kept my
hands on and one hand on his chest and one

1917
01:50:13,211 --> 01:50:16,630
hand on his neck and could
kind of sense the life,

1918
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:21,940
leave the body and you know, I said
a little prayer kind of avatar style,

1919
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:27,070
um, wrote one out beforehand, you know,
basically the ideas. Um, you know,

1920
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,450
as your spirit goes back to the source
to nourish new life, may your flesh,

1921
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:34,540
you know, nourish our bodies in this
life. You know, thank you system.

1922
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:36,820
That's very avatar.
Like he's very avatar.

1923
01:50:36,821 --> 01:50:39,970
Like if you set it next to me and
I would never let me live it down,

1924
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:44,460
I'd be saying thank you. Oh sister,
it's true. Why we're eating.

1925
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:49,390
It would be laughing, silly bitch and
our guide would, would do the same thing.

1926
01:50:49,391 --> 01:50:53,200
Most of the people that know that
they would say the same thing as you.

1927
01:50:53,201 --> 01:50:56,380
I mean this is for me what I
needed and thought you were saying.

1928
01:50:56,381 --> 01:51:00,900
They would say the same time. Nobody
would say what he said. He say me.

1929
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:02,870
But for me that's what I needed to say.

1930
01:51:02,871 --> 01:51:04,750
Like that's the way I'm
giving you a hard time.

1931
01:51:04,751 --> 01:51:07,270
But the reality is that's a
beautiful way of approaching it.

1932
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:11,200
I mean it's just something easy to make
fun of. And I'm a hack right there.

1933
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:14,680
I couldn't let it go, but then
so are I. Look at its eyes,

1934
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:17,860
its face and its face was
covered in these spines.

1935
01:51:17,861 --> 01:51:21,910
And so I thought it hit a cactus and
they were like all up in its eyeball and

1936
01:51:21,911 --> 01:51:24,520
stuff like that. And then
the, I smelled the flick,

1937
01:51:24,521 --> 01:51:27,700
I hear the flick of a lighter
and a cigarette and it's
our, you know, country guy.

1938
01:51:27,701 --> 01:51:30,700
He got like a Budweiser and a cigarette.
I don't know. He's south Texas guy.

1939
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:33,550
He says, oh, porcupines
spines, you know, you,

1940
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:35,680
you won't see that one
time and a thousand.

1941
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:39,190
And so basically some porcupine had
whacked it in the face and the spines were

1942
01:51:39,191 --> 01:51:41,020
working their way through its eyeball.

1943
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:46,180
So it was like kind of a cool feeling
to know that at that point, you know,

1944
01:51:46,181 --> 01:51:49,990
I had taken an animal out of
its misery, so to speak, to,

1945
01:51:49,991 --> 01:51:52,420
which was not necessarily my idea.
You know,

1946
01:51:52,421 --> 01:51:53,980
I was going to take an
animal that presented it,

1947
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:56,980
but that happened to be the
one that presented itself.

1948
01:51:56,981 --> 01:52:01,240
But then the really weird thing happened,
I got really angry at the porcupine,

1949
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:02,890
like my love for the animal,

1950
01:52:02,891 --> 01:52:07,450
my appreciation for the animal was so
strong and I fucking hated that porcupine.

1951
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:11,960
Really? Like, I felt like that was an
enemy. Like if someone tapped your sister,

1952
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:15,370
yeah, no pork, you ban. All
it did is poking in the,
yeah, you fucking stabbed it.

1953
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:20,380
But that's what [inaudible] Detroit on
that fucking poor deer. And you're like,

1954
01:52:20,381 --> 01:52:25,300
Conti Patti Pie. That's what's ironic is
that, I mean, I'm the killer. I killed it.

1955
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:28,120
The porcupine was just doing its thing.
But I hated the porcupine.

1956
01:52:28,121 --> 01:52:32,760
Like it was something that like slapped
a friend of mine. That's so weird. Yeah.

1957
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:36,160
Well I guess you had an intense
experience with it. So then you know,

1958
01:52:36,161 --> 01:52:39,350
and then from there we went
there and skinned it. You know,

1959
01:52:39,351 --> 01:52:42,400
you have to avoid the stomach because
the stomach smells like old guacamole,

1960
01:52:42,410 --> 01:52:45,230
smells terrible. It's like, try not to
puncture that. I got a little nick in it,

1961
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:49,580
but I did pretty good job. And then you
clear all the guts out and then, you know,

1962
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:52,480
cut all the pieces away.
But then we went fully from there,

1963
01:52:52,490 --> 01:52:56,780
just skinning it and then butchering
it entirely. And it was cool to feel,

1964
01:52:56,781 --> 01:52:59,690
you know, the best part of the meat is
the tenderloin, you know, that's what,

1965
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:02,180
you know, these flaming,
known chateau beyond.

1966
01:53:02,181 --> 01:53:04,820
That's what all this tenderloin meat is.
It's really tender.

1967
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:06,590
But not until I was up in,

1968
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:10,280
they're actually cutting the tenderloin
out and feeling what it felt like.

1969
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:14,210
It feels more like organ meat than regular
meat. You know? Did I understand like,

1970
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,820
oh, this is different part
of the animal. You know,

1971
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:20,330
this part of the animal is up inside,
like the cavity stuff.

1972
01:53:20,331 --> 01:53:23,480
It's not on the exterior part, so
it works less. It's just different.

1973
01:53:23,481 --> 01:53:26,090
It feels different and that's
why it tastes so delicious.

1974
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:28,820
And then the other parts like
the haunches, the back strap,

1975
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,490
they have a kind of a
more sinewy grittier feel.

1976
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:35,360
What the backdrop is the up along the
spine. That is the Loin? Yeah, no,

1977
01:53:35,361 --> 01:53:39,170
the backstrap backstrap is right
along the spine, right on either side.

1978
01:53:39,171 --> 01:53:43,970
On the exterior. The tenderloin is
actually up inside the animal underneath,

1979
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:46,420
like you go inside the rib cage.
So it's covered.

1980
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:48,860
Actually it's another section of it.
No,

1981
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:53,890
it's completely different
section backstrap backstrap
is alongside of the spine

1982
01:53:54,111 --> 01:53:58,400
and then the tenderloin is up underneath
the animal part of the internal muscles

1983
01:53:58,401 --> 01:53:59,540
that move the legs as well.

1984
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:03,460
There's a really cool video
of a dude taking apart a pig.

1985
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:08,110
I have it on my Twitter. If you want
to see it. It's kind of fucked up.

1986
01:54:08,111 --> 01:54:13,060
Like I, it's on my Twitter from a while
ago. So I don't know, uh, what the,

1987
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:16,960
uh, what the name of the video
is. See if you can find it, Brian,

1988
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:21,910
cause I know you're not doing
anything else. You want to
show that on Ustream. Uh,

1989
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:26,920
I think you can dude taking apart the pig.
But my point is when you watch it,

1990
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:30,490
like you watched like the,
like they're oh well that there's bacon.

1991
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:34,930
Oh well there's the ham hocks.
Oh that is that. There's this,

1992
01:54:34,931 --> 01:54:38,140
there's the pork loin. There's the,
when you, when you're watching it,

1993
01:54:38,141 --> 01:54:42,520
like be dissected from an actual pig
broken down and he does it in like three

1994
01:54:42,521 --> 01:54:45,910
minutes. They're fast. Yeah. This guy
just hacks through this fucking thing.

1995
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:50,590
He uses a saw and some spots.
This isn't it. This is,

1996
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:53,950
this is taken apart.
But this has taken a part of cooked pig.

1997
01:54:54,310 --> 01:54:58,540
This guy's got a raw one that's, that's
the one you want. You want the raw pig.

1998
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:05,770
I think this is probably, Yup. Well this
isn't the one that I, but I had seen,

1999
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:10,570
but this is similar where they just
start slicing through and it becomes,

2000
01:55:10,571 --> 01:55:14,200
it goes from an animal to meet and
then it makes that weird transition.

2001
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:18,380
But when you kill yourself, it never
makes that transition. Even when it's me,

2002
01:55:18,381 --> 01:55:20,250
it's like there's a re you,

2003
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:24,430
when you put that steak on the grill and
your seasoning it and you're cooking it,

2004
01:55:24,431 --> 01:55:28,420
like this is a weird connection with that
animal. That's the fucking literally,

2005
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:31,420
absolutely. Most people
don't get that. You know,

2006
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:33,430
they don't ever have a chance to get that.

2007
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,700
Yeah. And it's a, it's definitely
something, something completely different.

2008
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:41,470
It changes your whole opinion
of the meat and you know,

2009
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,740
probably there's some,

2010
01:55:42,741 --> 01:55:46,710
there's some placebo effect
in there because of your
emotional state towards the

2011
01:55:46,711 --> 01:55:48,420
animal. But there's also, you know,

2012
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:51,540
really feels like there's something
tangible there too. You know, some,

2013
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:55,890
some deeper appreciation that
actually manifests and I don't know,

2014
01:55:55,891 --> 01:55:59,100
I mean your mind is so important in so
many bodily functions to think that your

2015
01:55:59,101 --> 01:56:02,550
mind couldn't affect your digestion
or absorption or things like that.

2016
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:05,160
I don't think that's unreasonable either.
But whatever it is,

2017
01:56:05,161 --> 01:56:07,650
whether it's tangible or
whether it's mental, you know,

2018
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:12,300
the connection and the way
that you approach and digest,

2019
01:56:12,301 --> 01:56:16,680
assimilate that meat, which was, you
know, energy from another animal.

2020
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:17,903
It's just different.

2021
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:20,180
Yeah.
And even if it's not,

2022
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:25,340
I mean it is healthy and if you think
it's different, it becomes different. Yup.

2023
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:27,650
If you have this even like you can't,

2024
01:56:27,651 --> 01:56:30,830
it's hard to dismiss the
emotional connection that
you have to it because that

2025
01:56:30,831 --> 01:56:32,720
emotional connection is very important.

2026
01:56:32,721 --> 01:56:36,310
It is emotional connections or
something that people poo poo. Oh,

2027
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,740
you're just emotionally attached to
that. Well maybe it's good. You know,

2028
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:42,170
maybe it's something that you
like, you know, keep that thing,

2029
01:56:42,171 --> 01:56:43,340
whatever the fuck we're talking about.

2030
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:45,770
Emotional connections
is not necessarily bad.

2031
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:48,050
And if you have an emotional
connection like that,

2032
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:52,010
it would make the meat feel better.
Make you feel better. Like, oh,

2033
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:56,750
about your sustenance. Every time
we cook this deer, we're pumped.

2034
01:56:57,170 --> 01:57:01,190
We're excited about it. Oh, this tastes
so good. And it really does taste good.

2035
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,930
But just the feeling of

2036
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:06,660
having gone out there and you
know, caught it, butchered it,

2037
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,760
put it in our freezer
and then cooked it up.

2038
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:13,080
It's like a connection to something that
you know our ancestors had been doing

2039
01:57:13,081 --> 01:57:13,920
for thousands of years.

2040
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:18,350
Yeah. Really it is. It's weird. Even when
you're doing it in a place with fences.

2041
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:23,390
Yeah. No, I mean it's, it's not like going
to Africa and taken out a wild zebra,

2042
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,950
which by the way apparently are delicious.
Apparently Zebra stays good.

2043
01:57:27,951 --> 01:57:32,390
I never had a horse before until I went
to Joe beef and Montreal and they served

2044
01:57:32,391 --> 01:57:35,660
as horse hallmark. God, it's God
damn delicious. A lot of coke.

2045
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:40,260
A lot of Mars hate you saying that man.
The hate. You're saying that and I,

2046
01:57:40,261 --> 01:57:43,490
I get it. I've seen people in their
horses that's like their dog, right?

2047
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:48,110
It's pony better. I want to, it's probably
like more tender, smaller. I don't know.

2048
01:57:48,111 --> 01:57:50,720
The Shetland ponies are the
top. Top, fast, right? Yeah.

2049
01:57:50,721 --> 01:57:55,620
Anything with like the crazy pompom
feet don't probably crazy ass

2050
01:57:57,170 --> 01:58:00,320
Budweiser. Horses. Yeah, those
are big fucking whores too, man.

2051
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:03,470
What did they Chippendale's? What
are they called? A clydesdale

2052
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:09,650
that was going to be big stallions. Too
Bad. Oh, you went with the gay boys.

2053
01:58:09,651 --> 01:58:12,350
So when you went with the Chinese
voice earlier in the gay voice,

2054
01:58:12,351 --> 01:58:16,040
now you sign of a bitch.
You son of a bitch. So the,

2055
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:20,300
what we would do if we were going to have
a an on it hunting thing is basically

2056
01:58:20,301 --> 01:58:23,120
just used that ranch and you know,

2057
01:58:23,121 --> 01:58:26,180
just work it through like they could
do it through us, through our website.

2058
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:30,320
We explain it, maybe map out your
experience, Whitney's experience,

2059
01:58:30,321 --> 01:58:33,470
and I'm going to go there as soon to my
experience. I want to shoot a buffalo.

2060
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:36,290
I got a bit and in people
like it's not very sporting.

2061
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:38,780
I just want to eat a buffalo and
I want to shoot. To me, I want it.

2062
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:41,860
I have a giant freezer and I'm going
to set it up to eat my own meat.

2063
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,660
I just think it's the smart way to do it.

2064
01:58:43,661 --> 01:58:47,560
I think it's the healthiest way to do
it and I think that wild game like that,

2065
01:58:47,561 --> 01:58:50,110
whether it's buffalo or
deer and especially venison,

2066
01:58:50,111 --> 01:58:54,070
I think is like the most delicious meat
on earth. Elk is absolutely delicious.

2067
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:57,160
It's really the smart thing to
do. If you can do it, if you can,

2068
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:01,540
if you have the time, if you have the
finances to go to a place and, and hunt.

2069
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:04,930
It's really the smartest way to
gather me. And yeah, it just,

2070
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:07,330
it's the way we really should all do it.
And if we did,

2071
01:59:07,331 --> 01:59:11,350
we would have a totally different sense
of like this connection between man and

2072
01:59:11,351 --> 01:59:12,820
nature. Absolutely. Yeah.

2073
01:59:12,821 --> 01:59:16,180
And you could combine it with a lot of
other cool stuff we could do, you know,

2074
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:17,830
Kettlebell training workouts,

2075
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:21,730
s club and the day get people
familiarized with that aspect, you know,

2076
01:59:21,731 --> 01:59:25,870
have some talks and discussions about
different things and the nights and make a

2077
01:59:25,871 --> 01:59:26,950
cool experience out of it.

2078
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:31,720
The problem is is that you can't really
get that many people with guns together

2079
01:59:31,721 --> 01:59:35,410
at the same time. And we got
a lot of awesome customers.
They want to go do that.

2080
01:59:35,411 --> 01:59:39,740
So it's like, you know, can we, can we do
these things at 10 at a time every day?

2081
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:44,500
I don't think so. You know Gail, ability
of the gun thing is really challenging,

2082
01:59:44,501 --> 01:59:47,130
but we're going to try and
get some face to face. Some,

2083
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:52,000
some kind of program is smart to do
with the gun thing is to let them do it.

2084
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,640
Let the branch do it.
We don't have,

2085
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:58,530
because you don't want to put people
with psychos like we're going to have a

2086
01:59:58,550 --> 02:00:01,120
four of you are going to go hunting
together and one guy was just shooting the

2087
02:00:01,121 --> 02:00:04,810
ground under his feet trying to
rocket jump. You know what I mean?

2088
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:11,380
You never know what the fuck
you're getting into when
you meet random strangers.

2089
02:00:11,381 --> 02:00:15,670
It just a we all, we all love Alpha
brain. I love Outbrain, Outbrain,

2090
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:19,510
let's play most dangerous
game rock, paper,

2091
02:00:19,511 --> 02:00:23,040
scissors to go who gets
killed? Like tag. Yeah,

2092
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:25,630
there's a lot of nuts out there as well,
I'm trying to say but,

2093
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:29,860
but having a place where you know you
have like a gathering of the Juggalos type

2094
02:00:29,861 --> 02:00:31,330
situation for audit fans.

2095
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:35,110
Everybody gets together and does battle
rubs till they throw up in the garbage.

2096
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:38,190
Fucking truth texts,

2097
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:42,880
amazingly chest bump and it sounds like
a natural progression for on it to start

2098
02:00:42,881 --> 02:00:47,560
hunting. Well not on start
hunting but on it have um,

2099
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:52,720
have, uh, an option where we, you know,
we connect you with one of those places.

2100
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:54,750
That would be,
it would be a cool project.

2101
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:58,720
Love to have like a Ted Nugent style
set up and it's definitely not,

2102
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:04,050
it's the same as going out until like
the woods of Alaska and going and getting

2103
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:05,881
a brown bear.

2104
02:01:05,881 --> 02:01:09,280
And I would call it is there and you
call it conscious meet acquisition. Yes.

2105
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:10,050
That's great.

2106
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:13,840
It's like you're acquiring your meat in
a conscious way and that's really it.

2107
02:01:13,841 --> 02:01:17,080
It happens to be at the, you know,
at the tip of a rifle. But yeah,

2108
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:21,610
that's really what you're about to laser
that laser tag hunting with animals.

2109
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,710
Well, it's a funny thing
man, to do that with photos.

2110
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:27,610
People love try to get the crosshair.
Yeah, they do that. They close up on them.

2111
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:32,530
It's really dangerous. And Mountain Lions
people tried to do that. Um, the um,

2112
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,560
fuck photo tag. What did laser
tag is where you wear like a vast,

2113
02:01:38,561 --> 02:01:40,230
right? Yeah. Well,
yeah. Well you could put

2114
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,540
like best on an animal,
like a cat,

2115
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:46,040
just have a laser tag tag cat ranch
and you just try to shoot him because

2116
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:46,874
they're fast.

2117
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:51,220
People don't have any problem with fishing
in a place where they stock the fish.

2118
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:52,690
Like nobody has a problem with that.

2119
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:56,230
You go to a lake and the fish are in the
lake, like are they stocked it recently?

2120
02:01:56,231 --> 02:01:57,400
It's great and catch big trout.

2121
02:01:57,730 --> 02:02:00,530
But if you go like to a fence
in place and hunting an animal,

2122
02:02:00,531 --> 02:02:01,364
you're a piece of shit.

2123
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:05,790
Yeah, yeah. I, you know, I guess the
Mammo thing, you know, fish don't seem,

2124
02:02:05,791 --> 02:02:09,060
they're so different from us. I had a
cool experience fishing though recently.

2125
02:02:09,061 --> 02:02:11,880
I've always gone rod and reel
fishing and that's really foreign.

2126
02:02:11,881 --> 02:02:15,720
You're just kind of waiting around.
Then all of a sudden, oh shit.

2127
02:02:15,721 --> 02:02:18,630
And he grabbed the rod and reel it in
and you hope you get something and then

2128
02:02:18,631 --> 02:02:21,390
someone you know whacks it
on the head and you know,

2129
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:24,600
maybe you pull the hook out if you're
brave and sometimes you're with somebody

2130
02:02:24,601 --> 02:02:27,120
who does it, whatever that whole
program is, it's, it's different.

2131
02:02:27,121 --> 02:02:29,340
But I went spearfishing recently,

2132
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:33,690
which was kind of like a little bit
of a different paradigm as well.

2133
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:36,510
That one feels a lot different.
It's like hunting,

2134
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:40,230
but for fish instead of fishing cause
you're out free diving with this,

2135
02:02:40,231 --> 02:02:42,180
the last big wooden,
you know,

2136
02:02:42,181 --> 02:02:47,181
archaic looking thing with these bungee
cords hooked to this little metal spear

2137
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:49,860
and you're just free diving
down, you know, eight,

2138
02:02:49,861 --> 02:02:54,410
10 feet and chasing after these fish and
trying to spear them. So what it does,

2139
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:58,080
is it a spear gun? Yeah. So basically
it's an old triggers field gun.

2140
02:02:58,110 --> 02:03:01,920
The trigger releases the Bungee cord.
So you wrap these bungee cords like this,

2141
02:03:01,921 --> 02:03:06,810
you pull them manually and they go
on this little rod right in this,

2142
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:11,550
the spear slides in a groove and the
bungee cords or behind the Rod. Right.

2143
02:03:11,551 --> 02:03:13,020
And then when you pull the trigger,

2144
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:15,690
it just releases the thing
that's holding the bungee cords,

2145
02:03:15,691 --> 02:03:17,700
like a rubber band gun kind of.

2146
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:21,750
And so it releases that
and that propels the, the,

2147
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,220
the spear forward through the groove
and the spear is attached to a cord,

2148
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:31,410
right? So the bungee cords, it's all full
manual energy. You pull the cords back,

2149
02:03:31,411 --> 02:03:34,170
wrap it around and then
release it in the bungees go.

2150
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,800
But it's really particularly challenging
because as soon as the spear hits the

2151
02:03:37,801 --> 02:03:40,290
water,
it starts to dive a little bit.

2152
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:44,390
It doesn't always go perfectly straight
because of resistance. It's not like air.

2153
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:47,880
So, um, you know,

2154
02:03:47,881 --> 02:03:51,900
good people who are good could
probably do it, you know, 12 feet,

2155
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:57,000
15 feet, maybe even, maybe even farther.
People who suck, like me initially,

2156
02:03:57,150 --> 02:04:01,860
like I had to get like right up on
these fish to get, I'm like six feet,

2157
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:06,600
eight feet. How many did you do miss
before you got one time fucking done?

2158
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:10,110
I was missing him constantly. And you're
swimming around in his hard current.

2159
02:04:10,410 --> 02:04:13,200
But the cool thing is is some of the
fish you can catch with the hook.

2160
02:04:13,201 --> 02:04:17,220
Like you can get snapper, which is really
delicious. But the guide on the boat,

2161
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:20,700
and I was down in Mexico during this
guide and the boat was telling me that

2162
02:04:20,701 --> 02:04:23,640
parrot fish tastes like lobster
and I should really get pair fish.

2163
02:04:23,850 --> 02:04:26,280
Well Parrot fish are these little,
they have this little tiny mouth.

2164
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:29,640
All they do is eat algae and you never
catch them with a hook because you can

2165
02:04:29,641 --> 02:04:32,370
never get a hook and they're little tiny
mouth cause you got nothing they want

2166
02:04:32,371 --> 02:04:35,310
to eat that's on a hook unless you
gotta really algae hook or whatever.

2167
02:04:35,311 --> 02:04:36,240
But it would never happen.

2168
02:04:36,690 --> 02:04:40,410
So with spear phishing you can actually
target these fish and so we got one

2169
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:43,600
actually Whitney got, I didn't get
it. I fucking kept missing them.

2170
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:47,670
She was way more gangster with
a spear gun on that. But anyway,

2171
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:50,820
so she got one of these therapists and
then we brought it back to the boat and I

2172
02:04:50,821 --> 02:04:52,620
was really curious to eat it.
We brought it in,

2173
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:56,850
the chef's cooked it right away and he
who is fucking delicious best line ever.

2174
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:58,470
One of the best fish I ever had.

2175
02:04:58,471 --> 02:05:03,471
It was like a cross between like a
nice flaky white fish and like lobster,

2176
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:07,140
like somewhere in the middle.
Wow. It had that kind of,

2177
02:05:07,141 --> 02:05:11,760
that richer kind of
crustacean taste and texture.

2178
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:15,000
I want to go there and kill one
just to eat. It was so good.

2179
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,160
We had that and I had
trigger fish Svi Che,

2180
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:19,500
which is another type of fish
that you would never catch.

2181
02:05:19,630 --> 02:05:22,680
So it opens up the possibilities
and these Fisher plentiful,

2182
02:05:22,681 --> 02:05:24,000
it's not like there's endangered,

2183
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:26,910
they're endangered species
and any sharks I didn't,

2184
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:30,810
but that's dangerous when you're spear
phishing because the sharks will,

2185
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,510
you know,
know that there's fee.

2186
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:36,810
Cause when you hit the fish
there's fish guts exploding Jesus.

2187
02:05:36,811 --> 02:05:39,810
So if there are sharks,
it's not an optimal situation.

2188
02:05:39,811 --> 02:05:44,220
So doing it like off South African coast,
bad idea.

2189
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:47,400
Some dude just carjack Jack
in France on this honeymoon.

2190
02:05:49,330 --> 02:05:52,620
Tiger Shark. And, uh, I do
not know what charcot was,

2191
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:56,880
but I do know that he was the third
guy in two years to get Jack there.

2192
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,100
Too many for my cows.

2193
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:01,030
You know what they should have?
They should have a restaurant.

2194
02:06:01,031 --> 02:06:04,630
They have these in Japan where it's just
like this humongous saltwater pool in

2195
02:06:04,631 --> 02:06:08,170
the middle where you guys talking about
where you fished and you catch your own

2196
02:06:08,171 --> 02:06:10,630
dinner and it seems like
more places would have that.

2197
02:06:10,631 --> 02:06:14,170
Like you just have pretty much a huge
aquarium and you kind of get the fun of

2198
02:06:14,171 --> 02:06:16,990
catching your own fish and
then eating it on top of it.

2199
02:06:16,991 --> 02:06:20,280
Back when I was thinking of
silly Las Vegas restaurant ideas,

2200
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:24,220
I thought of an idea where you had that
with like lobsters and crabs and all

2201
02:06:24,221 --> 02:06:27,430
kinds of stuff and that you
could tell them a mermaid,

2202
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:31,630
someone with a mermaid fin to go down
and you'd point to the one you want and

2203
02:06:31,631 --> 02:06:33,580
the mermaid or to, okay,
that's the one you want.

2204
02:06:33,581 --> 02:06:35,590
She'd dive down and swim
and grab it for you.

2205
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:38,620
And everybody could sit around the tank
and watch the mermaid swimming around

2206
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:41,710
there. There's a, there's anybody here
that idea once I take it, go ahead.

2207
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:44,500
I don't need any credit. I just want
to go, just give me a reservation.

2208
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:49,530
There's a bar in Sacramento called I
think the mermaid bar where it's just this

2209
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:51,700
huge long bar.

2210
02:06:51,701 --> 02:06:55,720
And on the top there's this humongous
a aquarium and that they just have hot

2211
02:06:55,721 --> 02:07:00,070
chicks in a mermaid outfit
just swimming back and forth.

2212
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:05,110
And it's so eerie to just see like this
mermaid shake just swimming and Bobby.

2213
02:07:05,111 --> 02:07:07,390
But what sucks is everyone's
just sits there and takes photos.

2214
02:07:07,391 --> 02:07:10,100
Like no one's even talking. They're just
taking photos of the mermaid. Right.

2215
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:12,870
And there's no real point to,
it feels gimmicky.

2216
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,550
Like if they were actually fetching,
fetching stuff, watching stuff,

2217
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:19,150
working for you, or maybe,
you know, they're trying to
catch it with a net. Like,

2218
02:07:19,151 --> 02:07:21,100
do you have fish in there,
like you're saying? Yeah.

2219
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:22,870
They also have this a restaurant.

2220
02:07:22,871 --> 02:07:25,350
I've been researching a lot
of things in Japan lately,

2221
02:07:25,390 --> 02:07:27,370
but they have this restaurant
called the no panties,

2222
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:29,840
a restaurant where they
have, they have this, no,

2223
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:33,700
you were going to say that they have this,
uh, this, this thing, uh, what's, uh,

2224
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:35,980
like a conveyor belt
going around the top of

2225
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,990
the restaurant and they
just have huge dishes.

2226
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:39,940
And so you just go there to
your waitress and you're like,

2227
02:07:39,941 --> 02:07:42,040
I would like that roast beef.
And then she sits,

2228
02:07:42,041 --> 02:07:44,880
stands up on this like thing that get it.
Why did you choose those beef?

2229
02:07:46,830 --> 02:07:51,110
And she's got no panic and she's got
no panties on and it's a party support

2230
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:53,740
restaurants like this in America.
I mean if you really like to grow,

2231
02:07:53,741 --> 02:07:55,900
you would be constantly
getting more dishes, more food.

2232
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:59,200
What do you think that Americans is to
savage and that people would just start

2233
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:02,250
grabbing her and they wouldn't be
able to just let her do that I guess.

2234
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:06,220
I mean if there's not many restaurants
like that in America anyway that are

2235
02:08:06,221 --> 02:08:08,920
crazy, like there's that restaurant
Dick's where everyone's, they just like,

2236
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:12,480
or an asshole to you the whole time.
I would not email.

2237
02:08:12,490 --> 02:08:14,680
I can think that most partners,

2238
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:18,820
most spouses and you know in
America just would not allow.

2239
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:22,030
It would not go there and
we're not allowed to husbands
or boyfriends or anybody.

2240
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:23,980
You could go there, period. Ever.

2241
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:27,670
It's not exactly felt like no dogs.

2242
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:31,930
Restaurants like have a Hooters where
they're just just no top. Well they do.

2243
02:08:31,931 --> 02:08:34,200
I mean that place in Florida that
we went to a strip club, right.

2244
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:38,170
They serve wings and there's no
tops. Yeah. It's already been done.

2245
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:41,800
Rachel's best food ever. Yeah. There's a,

2246
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:44,410
there's nothing wrong with looking at
a little box where you're having some

2247
02:08:44,411 --> 02:08:47,200
roast beef on that little
vagina and just like,

2248
02:08:47,201 --> 02:08:51,080
there's nothing wrong for the gals to
to go to Cox and get some chicken while

2249
02:08:51,081 --> 02:08:53,770
dudes are swinging dicks in front of
him. Hot Dogs. They really wanted,

2250
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:57,700
what's wrong with it? Nothing. It's
nothing wrong with it. Whatever they want.

2251
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:01,000
Let them do what they want. Right.
Isn't that, wouldn't that be better?

2252
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:04,720
And let us all decide what we actually
like set of confusion the shit out of

2253
02:09:04,721 --> 02:09:07,630
Catholic school girls by
telling him the caucus bad.

2254
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:12,190
Who's the biggest freaks ever? Right.
Catholic school there were oppressed.

2255
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:15,410
Did you ever have a Catholic
school girl experience? Yeah.

2256
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:18,850
One of my first girlfriends
in Catholic high school,

2257
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:23,020
all girls high school and every one,
every girl in that class was rabid,

2258
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:27,070
rabid. They got ahold of some cock.
As soon as they got out of school,

2259
02:09:27,071 --> 02:09:29,380
they would just start jerking dudes off.
They couldn't help themselves.

2260
02:09:29,381 --> 02:09:32,450
They were in a trance.
Anytime we repressed those naturally,

2261
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:35,260
it's not going to get everything
all. That's fascinating, isn't it?

2262
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:38,260
That girl was easily one of the,

2263
02:09:38,261 --> 02:09:41,440
like most sexually explosive
girls I had ever dated ever.

2264
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:45,730
Like it was like as soon as you would
start making out, she would go full,

2265
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:48,580
like say tannic possession.
It was insane.

2266
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:53,560
It was rich with so many other emotions
of sin and danger and all of these

2267
02:09:53,561 --> 02:09:57,090
things wrapped up with an already
exciting sexual experience. Yeah,

2268
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,360
it's just too much.
Yeah,

2269
02:09:58,410 --> 02:10:03,270
and we were both 17 fuck you're doing
when you're 17 you're just, you're,

2270
02:10:03,271 --> 02:10:07,350
you're like just a meat machine.
Just moving to the whim of hormones.

2271
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:12,610
Dick Pills. That's what happens to me.
It's not though. It's not the same.

2272
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:14,380
It's not the same.
You're forcing it and you're like,

2273
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:18,620
oh good papa glug, glug, glug, glug.

2274
02:10:21,070 --> 02:10:24,580
There's a big difference between that and
when you do remember those 17 year old

2275
02:10:24,581 --> 02:10:28,900
boners, those things were ridiculous. They
would hurt your dick would get so hard.

2276
02:10:28,901 --> 02:10:32,050
It would hurt my dick felt like I was
going to blow up this morning cause yeah,

2277
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:36,730
but you're on pills.
Some wacky fucking shit that you got it.

2278
02:10:36,731 --> 02:10:37,260
Account store.

2279
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:39,830
I had to do the thing where I had to
take a shit when I woke up this morning.

2280
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:44,300
So I had to like have a bucket that I
usually use to calm your dog and so I

2281
02:10:44,301 --> 02:10:45,320
could pee in a bucket.
What?

2282
02:10:45,321 --> 02:10:47,240
Cause I couldn't Tuck my dick
down while I was shitting.

2283
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:49,130
Well you got to learn how
to have better balance.

2284
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,930
You gotta look at it like
doing a downward dog.

2285
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,990
I just grab a hold of the
top of the lid of the,

2286
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:57,380
you know the top where the upper deck
is, right. And then just bend down.

2287
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:59,770
Push your dick down. Yeah,
but don't push your ball.

2288
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:03,770
Don't push your ball style so far back
that it gets in the way. Your Shit. Yeah.

2289
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:07,670
Cause that's going to slide right down.
You're going to have to do one at a time.

2290
02:11:07,810 --> 02:11:11,220
That's where you going.
I couldn't have to rock bottom before.

2291
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,970
I mean when you guys, Shit,
you can't really stop that p.

2292
02:11:13,971 --> 02:11:15,850
That's like a p that
you can't stop whining.

2293
02:11:15,851 --> 02:11:18,920
You're shitting because it will stop
the shit also. You know what I mean?

2294
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:23,240
And then if he tried to stop it
that deeply, but now I'm forced to.

2295
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:28,460
I don't think I've ever actually
shit with above. I just wait.

2296
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:32,690
Brian is constantly on site
all day,

2297
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:37,250
every day. Can't get rid of boners.
It's affecting the way shit.

2298
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:40,980
He's like holding it in because he knows
his boner lasts for six hours and other

2299
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,860
three hours I'll be able to shit.
Yeah.

2300
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:44,320
So one of,

2301
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:48,140
one of the stories I've been reading
after reading Danieli Billy's book,

2302
02:11:48,141 --> 02:11:51,500
I went back and reread some of
my, uh, biographies of Rasputin.

2303
02:11:51,990 --> 02:11:56,480
Oh yeah. You want to as Dick.
Yeah. Freak pastured has,

2304
02:11:56,481 --> 02:11:59,660
apparently he had a foot long Dick
with award. At the root of it.

2305
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:05,360
They killed the guy. Well,
apparently there's pull it up, Brian.

2306
02:12:05,361 --> 02:12:08,780
This is Prince Putin's
cock. Prince Paul was, uh,

2307
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:12,950
apparently tried to make
homosexual advances at respite
and it wasn't feeling it.

2308
02:12:12,990 --> 02:12:17,990
Rasputin was the old hard drinking
Siberia and peasant wizard and he liked

2309
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:18,591
women.

2310
02:12:18,591 --> 02:12:22,790
And that was part of the adaptations
he made to his religion is that he was,

2311
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:25,130
he always struggled with the fact that,
you know,

2312
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:29,010
you couldn't have sex and Christianity,
but he wanted to be, you know,

2313
02:12:29,210 --> 02:12:33,620
man of deep faith. Brian's right there
under Google images. Rasputin's cocked.

2314
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:37,680
They really do have it.
Holy Shit. So, so yeah,

2315
02:12:37,690 --> 02:12:41,510
you put it up. He would, he would go in.

2316
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:43,710
I struggle with it.
You're allowed to have that on Ustream.

2317
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:48,180
I talked to Brad today. It
looks like a potato. And

2318
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:53,460
look at that. That is Rasputin's deck.
But apparently he could, he could base.

2319
02:12:55,470 --> 02:12:56,860
So he made an exception in yeah.
And his

2320
02:12:56,860 --> 02:13:00,040
religion. He, uh, he saw some birds
singing in the print. This is his story.

2321
02:13:00,070 --> 02:13:03,370
The birds were singing and they were
moved by sexual desire to sing such a

2322
02:13:03,371 --> 02:13:04,204
beautiful song.

2323
02:13:04,450 --> 02:13:09,290
And if the God made the birds sing to
create such a song and bring that out of

2324
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:12,790
them, then man's sexual desire
must be for the same thing.

2325
02:13:12,791 --> 02:13:14,710
And then he had this
revelation in the forest,

2326
02:13:14,711 --> 02:13:18,520
probably eating m Anita miscarry mushrooms
and then apparently came across three

2327
02:13:18,521 --> 02:13:19,870
women,
three women bathing,

2328
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:24,160
and he made love to each of them in turn
and then prayed more clearly than he'd

2329
02:13:24,161 --> 02:13:28,240
prayed in months. And it was
solidified. Yeah. Really,
because your mind is totally,

2330
02:13:28,241 --> 02:13:32,430
Chris Dodd was a giant Dick. Fuck yeah.
After that point he was like, okay,

2331
02:13:32,431 --> 02:13:34,950
so God didn't strike me down and
I'm praying better than ever.

2332
02:13:34,951 --> 02:13:39,030
So he adapted that to is a kind of
philosophy, but apparently he had,

2333
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:42,480
it was kind of a, a bit of a
hypnotist, wizard, whatever.

2334
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,850
I don't know how far you
want to go with his powers,

2335
02:13:44,851 --> 02:13:49,170
but the reports were that
he could contract and dilate
his pupils that will like

2336
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:52,320
through mental control so
he could do like weird shit.

2337
02:13:52,321 --> 02:13:57,321
And he had a huge Dick and we just made
just cut a swath through all of Russia.

2338
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:01,110
Everybody was able to
dilate his pupils at will.

2339
02:14:01,170 --> 02:14:03,870
It probably means he was
on drugs. Probably. Yeah,

2340
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:06,750
most likely giant Dick Dude on drugs.

2341
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:11,220
And that's where they didn't cut it off
at that and it looks like they went in

2342
02:14:11,221 --> 02:14:14,880
and kind of dug some of the dick out,
what they had to do to kill him.

2343
02:14:14,881 --> 02:14:18,000
So apparently this guy used to pull
for the bulb item, a lot of Poland,

2344
02:14:18,210 --> 02:14:20,970
a lot of people didn't like him.
They hated him for it.

2345
02:14:20,971 --> 02:14:22,260
He was probably fucked everybody.

2346
02:14:22,261 --> 02:14:26,880
There was accusations that he was fucking
this Arrieta and cause he was healing

2347
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:29,810
Tsar Nicholas The sun. So
all these kind of, you know,

2348
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:33,180
people were jealous at one point,
one point he was having so much sex.

2349
02:14:33,181 --> 02:14:34,980
He loved drinking and dancing and fucking,

2350
02:14:34,981 --> 02:14:37,710
and he was in this bar and he's
all haggard and they're like,

2351
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:40,380
you're not Rasputin. And he's
like, like hell, I'm not.

2352
02:14:40,381 --> 02:14:43,110
And he pulled his pants down and waved
to dick around and it was like, oh,

2353
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:45,240
your ass beat and okay,
whatever. Damn. But anyways,

2354
02:14:45,241 --> 02:14:49,620
this one guy wanted to prince USIP of
apparently wanting to have sex with,

2355
02:14:49,621 --> 02:14:51,150
rescued,
rescued and wasn't down with it.

2356
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:55,230
And the tide of the tide kind of turned
against them and popular culture and he

2357
02:14:55,231 --> 02:14:57,150
told his family that he
was probably going to die.

2358
02:14:57,630 --> 02:15:00,540
So they go there and they start
feeding him cyanide cakes, right.

2359
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:05,010
And apparently fed him enough cyanide
cakes to kill many, many people.

2360
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:05,970
But that didn't work.

2361
02:15:05,970 --> 02:15:08,970
Rasputin got a little bit sick and then
he kept eating the cakes and he was like,

2362
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:13,440
play me some gypsy music. Used to pop and
started dancing. They're like, oh fuck,

2363
02:15:13,441 --> 02:15:16,860
this isn't working. So then
they, then they took out a gun,

2364
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,320
shot him in his back, Bam, Bam.

2365
02:15:19,321 --> 02:15:22,560
Shot him right in the torso and his back
and he apparently just roared like a

2366
02:15:22,561 --> 02:15:23,880
bear and stared at him.

2367
02:15:23,881 --> 02:15:27,780
So they all freaked out
and started kicking him and
stomping him and kicked his

2368
02:15:27,781 --> 02:15:32,520
head and kicked him so hard that his
eyeball fell out and just totally beat him

2369
02:15:32,521 --> 02:15:35,220
to a bloody pulp and then
wrapped them in a carpet,

2370
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:38,220
wrapped them in change and
threw him in a frozen river.

2371
02:15:38,610 --> 02:15:42,810
And then when they found the body washed
up, he didn't die of any of that shit.

2372
02:15:43,020 --> 02:15:46,950
He died of drowning because they had the
water that they saw in his lungs from

2373
02:15:46,951 --> 02:15:49,980
him gasping for air.
So whatever the fuck was,

2374
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:53,750
this guy was doing you as a
strong motherfucker like no,

2375
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:58,290
they were not really unhappy with
him. Dude. His Dick was 11 inches.

2376
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:03,720
That's big. And it's thick as most
men's risks. That's what it says.

2377
02:16:04,190 --> 02:16:06,990
The Russian women were all about it.
That is incredible.

2378
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:10,290
The dude was just super gangster.
What do you mean it doesn't look that big?

2379
02:16:10,291 --> 02:16:14,850
It's bigger than that chick's whole
entire head. It's soft, dude. Oh,

2380
02:16:14,851 --> 02:16:18,360
you son of a bitch.
I don't think you're allowed to do that.

2381
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:22,140
Brad from Ustream will frown
upon those kinds of Shenanigans.

2382
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:25,890
We don't want to get them in trouble.
Brian. I think I found the big foot.

2383
02:16:25,891 --> 02:16:28,890
Look in the jar.
Shut the fuck off to stop.

2384
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:37,390
I've been talking to too many
big foot people, man. This, this,

2385
02:16:37,391 --> 02:16:40,090
this show has been very fascinating.
I'm learning a lot.

2386
02:16:40,091 --> 02:16:41,140
I can't wait to talk about it,

2387
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:46,170
but I can't talk about it yet because
I'm learning a lot weren't crazy people.

2388
02:16:46,611 --> 02:16:49,930
Sun Sasquatch is to,
Oh,

2389
02:16:49,931 --> 02:16:53,470
I'm wearing a lot about everything.
It's all connected. It's all,

2390
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:58,270
it's all connected cycles. Psychic,
Sasquatch, the whole thing.

2391
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:02,590
Ufos. No, no shape my balls.

2392
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:05,530
Um, trim, Trim. The upper stack.

2393
02:17:05,630 --> 02:17:08,360
Do you put shaving cream on
or you just lightly glide the,

2394
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:13,310
I'm glad you asked Brian. I like to use
a double blade, razor and defense soap.

2395
02:17:13,311 --> 02:17:17,810
I lather up the old sacker Rooney,
get it nice and primed with soap.

2396
02:17:17,811 --> 02:17:20,330
And then just the razors of today,

2397
02:17:20,390 --> 02:17:23,000
you don't need to go five bucks.

2398
02:17:23,030 --> 02:17:25,010
I don't know how many blades are
on there cause I can't count.

2399
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:29,380
So I just get in there,
whatever it says. Never son.

2400
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:31,730
These razors are so good these days.

2401
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:33,770
You're not going to nick it unless
you're not paying attention.

2402
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:38,630
What about asshole? I let that go. He's
like, oh I let welcome to the jungle.

2403
02:17:38,631 --> 02:17:42,740
We got fun and Games. I don't know what's
going on back there. I leave it alone.

2404
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:45,500
I wash it whenever possible and ignore it.

2405
02:17:45,501 --> 02:17:50,030
I guess like a squirrel with a bullet
wasn't very happy with the balls forward.

2406
02:17:50,031 --> 02:17:52,610
Everything back outsider,
I dunno.

2407
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:56,090
I Dunno where it fits in the equation and
I want them to do their rake went over

2408
02:17:56,091 --> 02:18:00,920
it. My Shit usually looks
like like it's like a lot of,

2409
02:18:00,921 --> 02:18:05,921
there's a lot of green in
there like chunks of leafy
vegetables until I gorge on

2410
02:18:06,411 --> 02:18:09,170
meat and then it becomes a hard chunky.
Brian,

2411
02:18:09,171 --> 02:18:11,950
do you think that hairy vaginas
are can making a comeback? Yeah,

2412
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:15,050
they are,
but I mean there's two different kinds.

2413
02:18:15,051 --> 02:18:18,350
There's the ones that they've always had
the hairy vagina and then there's the

2414
02:18:18,351 --> 02:18:22,060
girls that recently like I'm taking care
of this and bring it back because I,

2415
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:25,820
there was one recently where it
was just like, no, this has not,

2416
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,710
this is like seventies vagina.

2417
02:18:27,711 --> 02:18:30,840
That hasn't been touched since the 70s
and I think that that's a little too much.

2418
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:33,290
Yeah, that's too much. That's
discussing. I don't, I, I, you know what,

2419
02:18:33,291 --> 02:18:34,670
I like it completely shaved.

2420
02:18:35,060 --> 02:18:37,790
Yeah. Nothing wrong with that
either. It's interesting though,

2421
02:18:37,791 --> 02:18:42,110
what a total victory porn has had over
the way women take care of their vaginas.

2422
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:46,820
Complete. Damon took Dave internalized
the whole philosophy. Yeah.

2423
02:18:46,850 --> 02:18:49,040
Well they had to keep up.
They had to compete.

2424
02:18:49,070 --> 02:18:53,690
Too many guys were like looking at these
perfectly shaved vaginas and with girls

2425
02:18:53,691 --> 02:18:55,250
licking them and you know,

2426
02:18:55,251 --> 02:18:57,380
beaten off to him and then the
women catch them and I'm like, Oh,

2427
02:18:57,381 --> 02:19:01,160
this mother fucker likes this shit.
I got to shave it all down.

2428
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:03,940
And like the little Hitler ones that
the girls do that almost like, hey,

2429
02:19:03,941 --> 02:19:07,900
you're putting an eyelash or an eyebrow
on your pussy. That's creepier to me.

2430
02:19:07,901 --> 02:19:08,980
Then having,
here's the

2431
02:19:09,390 --> 02:19:13,840
man, I never had a problem with
the big Bush. You know, when,

2432
02:19:13,841 --> 02:19:17,140
when girls started trimming it all down,
I was like, yeah, I guess that's better.

2433
02:19:17,290 --> 02:19:21,040
But do you remember like when you were
in high school and girls never shaved it?

2434
02:19:21,390 --> 02:19:25,320
It was always craziness down
there. It was chaos down there. Do.

2435
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:27,980
You didn't get upset. You know,
you didn't get bummed out.

2436
02:19:27,981 --> 02:19:30,320
You remember like we tell stories like
dude, all the way up to her assholes,

2437
02:19:30,370 --> 02:19:32,420
just can't remember where I
fucking a year over a back,

2438
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:35,300
and this is a girl that I dated who
had hair. She had hair everywhere.

2439
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:39,100
I mean it was crazy. She had like
her lower back was Harry, you know,

2440
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:41,210
she was hot as fuck though,
Dude. It didn't matter.

2441
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:44,540
She was just cannot deal with
that. Oh, you could have, trust me.

2442
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:48,190
You could've dealt with it.
I'm definitely down with the whole Harry,

2443
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:53,390
the whole thing down there. But then
the armpits still in the last, I can't,

2444
02:19:53,391 --> 02:19:56,120
I can't deal with that. Yeah,
I'm not even good with that.

2445
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:58,100
When I see a little light
fuzz on their cheek,

2446
02:19:58,190 --> 02:20:00,190
you know when the sunlight
hits it, right. Creeps.

2447
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:03,170
But the armpits and like even
the hairy legs, not so much,

2448
02:20:03,171 --> 02:20:04,550
but the armpits still fucked me up.

2449
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:09,320
I was friends with a gal who went
to an all girls college in um,

2450
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:14,050
in Boston. I forget which one, but
it's super, she was super left wing,

2451
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:17,480
like the most left wing person
ever dated like vegetarian,

2452
02:20:17,481 --> 02:20:20,420
like full on her friends and
shaved their legs at all.

2453
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:23,330
She didn't shave her legs either,
but she was blonde so you couldn't tell.

2454
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:27,710
But her friend looked like a hobbit.
It was the strangest thing ever.

2455
02:20:27,711 --> 02:20:32,270
I W W whenever house, her friend
was Greek and she had hobbit legs,

2456
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:37,540
her legs would just black with hair and
black feet and I'm complete and total

2457
02:20:37,911 --> 02:20:39,530
hypocrite to say there's
something wrong with that.

2458
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:44,180
Complete total hypocrites doesn't
really fit at all. Well, how could I,

2459
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:49,010
how dare I say anything?
It's true. There's wrong with
that. If that's her choice,

2460
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:53,120
but damn it was gross.
Didn't matter.

2461
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:57,710
I have no business thinking it's gross.
I'm fucking grocer for sure.

2462
02:20:57,950 --> 02:21:00,890
But it was gross. I had to get out
of there. It was freaking me out.

2463
02:21:00,891 --> 02:21:05,720
It's fucking hairy feet. It was
just so weird. They were so weird.

2464
02:21:05,721 --> 02:21:08,630
They were like, they were, they were
both. They both came from money,

2465
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:13,010
money and educated parents and they were
like just fucking fighting the power

2466
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:17,150
tooth and claw and I guess
I really appreciate that.
And then a lot of ways like,

2467
02:21:17,151 --> 02:21:17,391
you know,

2468
02:21:17,391 --> 02:21:21,800
if you have like really oppressive parents
are very strict parents and once you

2469
02:21:21,810 --> 02:21:23,540
very rigid in their focus,

2470
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:27,950
you want to break away from that and
like make it warm. Completely radical.

2471
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:31,930
Opposing opinions make a statement.
But when the armpit hair starts creeping,

2472
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:34,850
like I'm in a new beach that's
creeping over onto the tit, you know,

2473
02:21:34,890 --> 02:21:38,950
if you ever did he go here and
it says on the nipples. Yeah.

2474
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:42,650
Big hitters that they didn't do a
daily down the Nipples, right? Yup.

2475
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:47,830
[inaudible]
back to weird places there now Joe,

2476
02:21:48,150 --> 02:21:49,970
Esther head one really long
and it got caught in my,

2477
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:53,900
between my two front teeth and it
plucked and she screamed, Jesus son,

2478
02:21:54,530 --> 02:21:59,090
that's not true. Wow. He
just got called outside.

2479
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:02,600
You just got called the fuck out now.
And you need to tell the truth though.

2480
02:22:02,601 --> 02:22:04,850
Is it true or is it not true?
Yeah, it's true. Totally true.

2481
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:12,230
Brian. Sorry. Apologize. No
perfect person right there.

2482
02:22:14,070 --> 02:22:16,550
All right, let's get the fuck out
of here. It's late. It's 10 30.

2483
02:22:16,551 --> 02:22:20,300
I've been working all day talking to crazy
people and I can talk to a senator to

2484
02:22:20,301 --> 02:22:23,510
him about Ufo Ufos.
Can wait to tell you,

2485
02:22:23,511 --> 02:22:27,960
but you got an a half to a, if anybody
hasn't seen any of my latest videos,

2486
02:22:27,961 --> 02:22:30,780
I just did one on the psychedelic
experience. Pretty cool.

2487
02:22:30,781 --> 02:22:33,230
Please try and check it
out. Doing like these, uh,

2488
02:22:33,250 --> 02:22:37,410
Jason [inaudible] pills and they're
fucking good man. What was that?

2489
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:40,540
The one on the psychedelic experience
just called the psychedelic experience.

2490
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:44,790
vimeo.com/warrior poet us now
can check them out. It's fun.

2491
02:22:44,850 --> 02:22:48,060
That's a very good one. It's
very fun. I enjoy it very much.

2492
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:49,380
I liked that you do in that two man.

2493
02:22:49,550 --> 02:22:51,210
And it's really easy to
criticize those things.

2494
02:22:51,211 --> 02:22:54,290
It's really easy to mock
them and make fun of. And uh,

2495
02:22:54,330 --> 02:22:55,620
if you were in front
of me when you did it,

2496
02:22:55,621 --> 02:22:59,310
I probably would have mocked you a little
bit. But it's not that it's not good.

2497
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:01,590
It's trying to put some,
put some info out there.

2498
02:23:01,591 --> 02:23:05,340
You know the right vibes out there and
that's the problem with the right vibes

2499
02:23:05,341 --> 02:23:08,970
as they'd been co opted by silly
douche bag. So if you get in that mix,

2500
02:23:08,971 --> 02:23:11,850
that energy vibe, love mix, you can,

2501
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:14,730
you know immediately like what bitch,
what are you doing?

2502
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:15,660
What are you trying to do over there?

2503
02:23:15,661 --> 02:23:19,830
And you started to call you a and
you fuckhead you know it's like no,

2504
02:23:19,831 --> 02:23:22,440
you're trying to do the right thing,
but there's so many people that aren't,

2505
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:25,110
that are mixed up in the
same vein. I, that's why,

2506
02:23:25,450 --> 02:23:29,910
I mean I hear going to burning man's a
lot of fun. Good fucking luck with that.

2507
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:33,690
Good luck with that because this is at
least 10 dudes there that you do not ever

2508
02:23:33,691 --> 02:23:37,110
want to be stuck talking to and they're
there in a tent right next to you.

2509
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:38,850
Just at least 10 dudes,

2510
02:23:38,970 --> 02:23:42,750
10 dude that a 20 I would say
maybe let's be super generous.

2511
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:45,330
If Bernie man has 50,000 people,

2512
02:23:45,331 --> 02:23:48,780
I don't know how many people would ask
if it has 50,000 people and 10 of them

2513
02:23:48,781 --> 02:23:53,040
are just insufferable twats
why would you go right?

2514
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:57,360
Maybe because 10 of them are
unimpossible inspirations,

2515
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:59,820
but the people that go to Brian, man,
I know so many cool people that go,

2516
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:03,240
there's a lot of fuck crampy.
Hancock goes and so you'd go for though.

2517
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:08,160
You figure those guys balance out the
comments. If you could stay with them,

2518
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:11,520
stick close to the herd, don't
stress. It just sounds like a lot of,

2519
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:15,150
it's pretty intense. It's dust
everywhere. Just no sandwiches

2520
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,920
bartering forever. I can't
probably. Awesome. We've never gone.

2521
02:24:19,921 --> 02:24:22,590
How can we talk about coffee?
We're talking to you about
something we never did.

2522
02:24:22,591 --> 02:24:25,890
We got to go. Sorry. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry. Listen,

2523

there enjoying burning man.

2524

Why are you listening to
the fear factor guy? Okay.

2525
02:24:30,991 --> 02:24:34,650
Make up your own mind about shit.
I don't even believe what I say.

2526
02:24:34,651 --> 02:24:38,940
I'm just trying to fill three hours and
