1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,860
the neuroscience stuff is
like my bread and butter.

3
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:04,760
That's what I love.

4
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:06,700
And that is the holy grail of neurosis.

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,090
So when you hear like Depok show pro
type dudes talk about consciousness,

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,580
my eyes rolling like Deepak Chopra,

7
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:12,941
I just,

8
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:15,670
it's really hard for me to not
just discount everything he says.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,451
Really.

10
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:17,480
I reason it's,

11
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,861
I mean,

12
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,020
I know that there's truth there,

13
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:19,541
but he is,

14
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,530
he's a whoop peddler

15
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,143
Chopra,

16
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,930
um,

17
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,650
uh,

18
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,101
Eckhart.

19
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:27,934
Totally.

20
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,910
Terry Robbins,

21
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,690
is that his name?

22
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,400
Greg Fitzsimmons loves ECKART.

23
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:37,050
Toley he's probably the least
hook story of all of them,

24
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,884
but he's still,

25
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,101
well,

26
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,281
what,

27
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:42,030
what do you think is huckster worry
about providing motivation to people and

28
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,720
giving people sort of a
framework to work on as far as,

29
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,320
uh,

30
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
living in the now and
taking charge of their life,

31
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,210
especially if it's something that
someone like Eckhart Toley had personal

32
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,671
success.

33
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:55,980
We'll compare somebody like at cart.

34
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:57,510
Totally to robins.

35
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:57,950
Yeah.

36
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,030
Compare and Eckhart totally.

37
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,560
Or an Anthony Robbins to,

38
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,281
for example,

39
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,090
somebody like,

40
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,923
um,

41
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,410
um,

42
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,561
oh,

43
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:04,191
what's his name?

44
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,090
I was able to,

45
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:05,901
God,

46
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:06,734
no,

47
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,190
I was able to interview a,

48
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,540
this,

49
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,540
this really interesting guy who has a phd
in molecular genetics and then move to

50
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:16,010
the Himalayas to become a Buddhist monk.

51
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:16,790
Um,

52
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,940
his name is Matthew Ricard and he's,

53
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,030
he's a French Buddhist monk and he talks
about mindfulness meditation and he

54
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,240
talks about the neuroscience of the
things that the Tibetans are doing right

55
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,074
now,

56
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,300
but he's not trying to
make money off of it.

57
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,170
And I think that is a fundamental
kind of red flag for me.

58
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:38,330
I'm not saying just because
somebody is trying to make money,

59
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,130
they are selling snake oil.

60
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,540
Right.

61
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,510
But first of all,

62
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,470
what's the motivation that,

63
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,410
that that has to be the first red flag.

64
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,280
And then you go into,

65
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,860
what is it that they're
saying if they're talking,

66
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,100
if they're trying to use science and
they're trying to kind of go in and pick

67
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:57,410
and choose the science that
tells the story the right way,

68
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:01,460
and then they're making these really
broad a leaps from that science.

69
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,110
It makes me nervous.

70
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,861
So it's,

71
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,350
it's one thing if you've got like a
motivational speaker who's just like,

72
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,920
I know this about the world and
I'm not basing it on anything,

73
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,510
but if you like me to come follow me.

74
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:11,841
And it's like,

75
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,021
yeah,

76
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:12,621
that's fine.

77
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:12,891
I mean,

78
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:13,341
what is that?

79
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,450
That's like culty behavior,

80
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,284
but that's fine.

81
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,340
But when people pick and choose how they
want to use science and how they want

82
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:21,920
to bastardize science to meet their needs,

83
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:22,910
it makes me nervous.

84
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,460
I did a piece recently about
the power of positive thinking.

85
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,031
Um,

86
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:28,970
I've also done a piece about the
power of prayer and I went through the

87
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:33,290
literature and I tried to find examples
where positive thinking actually helped

88
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,040
people.

89
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,210
And there's just no good evidence that
thinking positively is going to actually

90
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,770
bring goodwill to your life.

91
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,090
Like the secret,

92
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,691
you know this like,

93
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:41,841
well,

94
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:43,070
if I just want it bad enough,

95
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,120
I'm going to make a bunch of money.

96
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,750
It's like,

97
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,321
no,

98
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,160
if you want it bad enough,

99
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:47,630
you're going to have
to fucking work for it.

100
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,560
And then it's gonna come to you.

101
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:52,250
And actually they find that the power of
positive thinking can actually be kind

102
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:57,251
of detrimental to cancer patients because
it causes a whole extra layer of guilt

103
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,500
to the process of dying.

104
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:02,980
You know,

105
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,620
you caused this to yourself
because you didn't,

106
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,420
you didn't think positively enough,

107
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,920
you didn't will yourself out of this.

108
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,850
And there's a whole culture around that
in America where we kind of blame the

109
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,550
victims and where we
call cancer survivors,

110
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,361
survivors,

111
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,700
and we call cancer victims victims,

112
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:18,971
you know,

113
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:19,804
and it's like,

114
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,390
and you're not doing so well.

115
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,970
Nobody says it directly to
somebody who was dying of cancer.

116
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,320
Well you didn't will yourself out of it,

117
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,560
but they feel that because they say it
indirectly to the people who are coming

118
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:29,950
out of it.

119
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,191
Oh,

120
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:33,700
it was all that nice prayer and all those
positive thoughts and all those Oprah

121
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:34,780
magazines you read.

122
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,111
You know,

123
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,944
and it's like,

124
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,791
I don't know.

125
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,560
I think that's a bad precedent to set.

126
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,940
It's also shitty science
because if you're,

127
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:42,181
you know,

128
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,790
you're only looking at the
group that was successful.

129
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,711
Well,

130
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:46,910
not all the people that died.

131
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,050
And that's the thing.

132
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,230
I tried to look at a lot of those
studies and I tried to compare,

133
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,801
you know,

134
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,980
and and I found enough stuff out there
that kind of shows that the power of

135
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,600
positive thinking is not a real thing.

136
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:57,380
Also,

137
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,580
prayer is not a real thing.

138
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,240
Disagree to the power of positive
thinking is not a real thing.

139
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,650
I think it's a good way to operate and
live your life in a happy manner will

140
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,650
probably lend you to
being more successful.

141
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:09,850
You'll have less hurdles.

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,890
It's like it's like talking about Karma,

143
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,370
you know like in some sense Karma is
totally real because if you're a fucking

144
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,320
nice person and you're just,

145
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:17,501
you,

146
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,970
you do goodwill all of the time,

147
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,830
sometimes shitty things
are going to happen to you,

148
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,080
but most people are going
to be nice to you too.

149
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,790
If you put bad Karma out there.

150
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,880
To me what that really means is if you're
just a fucking asshole all the time,

151
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,980
people are going to be
an asshole back to you.

152
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,401
Like,

153
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,151
that's obvious,

154
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,470
but I don't believe that Karma is some
sort of cosmic force that says you,

155
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,950
you store up goodwill with the universe
and then the universe pays you back.

156
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,270
Try Monday Joe Rogan podcast.

157
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,340
Well,

158
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,510
the last time you were here you coined

159
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,180
grace,

160
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,990
or you used a phrase that I have stolen
and abused over and over and over again.

161
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,273
I'll give you credit,

162
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,270
but it's Wu peddler.

163
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,110
Oh Yeah,

164
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,190
love that box show pro.

165
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,210
Yeah.

166
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,791
Yeah.

167
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,890
I definitely didn't coin that,

168
00:04:58,891 --> 00:04:59,940
but I love it too.

169
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:00,660
I use a lot.

170
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,710
Every time I see that dude,

171
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:06,550
I just think Wu peddler have a little
kind of Twitter thing with him.

172
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,140
I was calling him,

173
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,900
I asked if he whooped
pedaled much like I am a god.

174
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:13,910
And you were like [inaudible].

175
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:14,790
And he was like,

176
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,211
oh,

177
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,021
it was really funny.

178
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:16,900
I favorite at it,

179
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,240
but he was actually like,

180
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:18,520
he was,

181
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,980
he had a good sense of humor about it.

182
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,470
I don't think he takes
himself totally seriously.

183
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,043
Seriously.

184
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,973
I think he gets,

185
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,790
he gets ahead of himself and he
said some really ridiculous shit.

186
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,260
And then when people call them on it,

187
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:31,560
you know,

188
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,180
he just starts using the word quantum.

189
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Quantum consciousness is know I think
better him than a lot of other people in

190
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,320
his position better him.

191
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:50,760
Then you know that Kevin
Trudeau guy that's selling
you weight loss secrets that

192
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:52,190
they don't want you to know about.

193
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:52,650
You know what I mean?

194
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,020
It doesn't seem like depot
Deepak's trying to sell his books,

195
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,160
but outside of that I don't
really feel like he that much of,

196
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,641
you know,

197
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,570
like a Predator,

198
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:04,220
like he's not using this kind of pseudo
science and truth be told there is a

199
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,560
little bit of truth to some of
the things that he talks about,

200
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:06,761
but,

201
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,640
but he does kind of,

202
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,050
I think step way outside of the boundaries
of what's reasonable and healthy.

203
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,801
But you're right,

204
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:16,520
I don't think he's actually trying to
take advantage of people fundamentally.

205
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:20,710
I think that Deepak Chopra
thinks what he's talking about.

206
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
I mean he believes in what he's talking
about and I think that he actually

207
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,940
thinks that he's helping people
and maybe it's helping some people,

208
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,770
but he's also peddling a lot of woo.

209
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,823
I think,

210
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,980
I think he probably is helping a lot.

211
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,410
I think he's definitely
peddling a lot of woo.

212
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:37,190
And the one thing that I always get out
of him is that I don't think even he

213
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,480
knows what he's saying.

214
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I think there's a lot of times where
people will try to impress upon you that

215
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:46,430
what they're saying is important.

216
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,410
And one of the ways they do that is by
using these like really kind of like

217
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,610
vague terms.

218
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,230
That sound fantastic.

219
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,561
Yeah.

220
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,251
I mean that's really,

221
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,170
I think where that term
pseudoscience comes from.

222
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,370
It's not real science,

223
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:58,561
it's,

224
00:06:58,561 --> 00:06:58,821
it's,

225
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,260
it's fake science,

226
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,280
it's bad science.

227
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:04,310
But it sorta sounds like
science to an untrained ear.

228
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,190
And that's the dangerous thing is if you
throw around a lot of really big words

229
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:08,750
and you are really authoritative,

230
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,450
a lot of people kind of believe
what you're telling them.

231
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,343
What also do

232
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:13,901
that.

233
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,600
Some of it does have some truth to it.

234
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,820
And when you fuck around
and pretend that it all does

235
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,710
mush it altogether,

236
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,171
you,

237
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:21,381
you,

238
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:21,621
you,

239
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,480
you create this really cloudy atmosphere.

240
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:23,571
Well,

241
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:23,990
I'm under,

242
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,310
I'm not sure what the fuck you're saying.

243
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,330
And I'm not sure if it's true,

244
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,330
but it's really hard for like
an everyday person who goes,

245
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:29,571
okay,

246
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,520
well I've heard that before and you know,

247
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,140
my doctor told me that and you know,

248
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,160
that seems important.

249
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,830
And then they throw in all
these other things will,

250
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,350
I mean if you're an authority figure and
you're saying all these things that are

251
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:39,621
true,

252
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:40,540
I guess I should believe you.

253
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,570
And you say all these other things,

254
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,560
it's a really dangerous,

255
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,580
um,

256
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,413
you know,

257
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,260
that's it,

258
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,093
right?

259
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,610
It says,

260
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,210
I was an atheist Hashtag
until I discovered I was God.

261
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,141
And then I said,

262
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:52,471
son,

263
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,420
don't make me smack you woo pedal.

264
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:54,520
Yeah,

265
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,890
much.

266
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,940
And then he responded,

267
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,410
he responded something really funny.

268
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,400
I don't know if you can find it.

269
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:58,611
Yeah.

270
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,250
Like I roll God in drag.

271
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,440
That actually is very fun.

272
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,351
It's like,

273
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:06,471
oh,

274
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:07,340
that's pretty awesome.

275
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:07,791
Well,

276
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,121
you know,

277
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:13,121
he did a thing with his son where his
son of followed him around with a camera

278
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,230
and completely exposed
him and he went on tour,

279
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,410
like promoted this with his son and did
like interviews on like opie and Anthony

280
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,560
and all these different places.

281
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,480
But one of them was like his son,

282
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:29,780
like caught him sleeping when he
was supposed to be meditating.

283
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:31,580
I'm going to the temple to meditate.

284
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,081
I mean,

285
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:32,960
they go into the temple,

286
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:33,794
he's,

287
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,530
he's completely out cold line.

288
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:36,410
I his back and it's,

289
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:36,980
it's,

290
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,350
it's quite funny because his son sort of,

291
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,801
you know,

292
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:44,060
grew up with him and his sons and
fathers have notoriously contentious

293
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:44,894
relationships.

294
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,890
I'm always incredibly impressed when I
meet a daughter who gets along great with

295
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:53,420
her mom or a son who gets along great
with his dad because somewhere along the

296
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,830
line and those male,

297
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,350
male,

298
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,741
female,

299
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:58,890
female relationships that seems to
be this like changing of the guard or

300
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:01,500
something like that or this
need to be your own person.

301
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,250
And [inaudible] son has
that shit in buckets,

302
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,290
buckets full of that.

303
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,900
And it's cool that Deepak doesn't
really take himself too seriously.

304
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,521
He,

305
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:10,800
you know,

306
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,360
his son catches him asleep and he's like,

307
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:12,511
yeah,

308
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,344
but

309
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,573
I was not called,

310
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,620
I was traveling.

311
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,070
It was aware of,

312
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,310
I was,

313
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,000
my third eye was open
to the possibilities.

314
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,673
Yeah.

315
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,813
He did a,

316
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,270
uh,

317
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,270
an interview or a debate rather with
Richard Dawkins fairly recently on,

318
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,710
I think it was,

319
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,580
he was challenging Dawkins on the
concept of atheism and you know,

320
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,490
and Dawkins was just being
as cadre old country settled,

321
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,130
but it actually made it actually
made him Dawkins look bad.

322
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,600
And I mean that's the thing,

323
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:47,791
it's,

324
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,610
it's when you engage in those kinds of
conversations with people who can really

325
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,444
hold their own,

326
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,430
you've gotta be really
careful because Dawkins,

327
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:54,310
I think he's taking,

328
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,220
and I respect the man immensely.

329
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,950
His take is very much an educated,

330
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,161
you know,

331
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,210
I'm an evolutionist,

332
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,590
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

333
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,900
These are the reasons that
I don't believe in God,

334
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,120
but he's very hard lined about it.

335
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:09,900
And there is something about
being this kind of ivory tower,

336
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,320
British elite that just kind
of makes you seem like a dick.

337
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,550
Even like he's not a dick.

338
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,660
He's a really sweet man.

339
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,381
I've met him before.

340
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:16,830
He's,

341
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,950
he's soft spoken.

342
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,490
But the truth is you,

343
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,660
you put those two men in a room together,

344
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,150
Depok knows what he's doing.

345
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,480
He knows that like part of a debate
or part of the conversation is about

346
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,550
bringing out certain aspects
of somebody's character.

347
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:30,720
It's about likability.

348
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,760
And I think it's easy for people who
aren't already kind of hard lined atheist

349
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,220
and who aren't already big
dock and supporters to be like,

350
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,660
that guy seems mean.

351
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,741
Well,

352
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,820
I think he is mean.

353
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,760
I disagree with you.

354
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,390
I think he is a dick
and I think he is mean.

355
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,410
And I think um,

356
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,670
that's because he's had to deal with
idiots over and over and over again.

357
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:55,290
And he's an extremely intelligent man
and he's tired of it and it gets this

358
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,610
quivering and his lips,

359
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,080
when he talks to people,

360
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:58,300
you know,

361
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,651
no,

362
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:00,000
that is not what's going on.

363
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,620
He gets so furious about defending
science and defending the truth.

364
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,820
I don't think he's a
dick in an unjust way.

365
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,440
And he's a Dick for a reason.

366
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,270
He's a Dick because he's a normal guy.

367
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,080
I think he's also a dick because he's a
normal guy with a lot of knowledge that

368
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:19,230
doesn't have a lot of
release in his life probably.

369
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:19,831
And he's also,

370
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:23,160
I think he's also sheltered a little
bit because of his position because of,

371
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,521
you know,

372
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:26,460
when you work in academia and you're
kind of surrounded by likeminded people a

373
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:30,570
lot and only periodically do you go out
into the real world where there's a lot

374
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,060
of people who don't have the education
that you have and who have totally

375
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,010
different values and belief systems.

376
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,450
I'm sure it can be really,

377
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,600
really frustrating because
you're constantly having
to defend a position that's

378
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:43,170
the rational that like anybody else
who's come up through the ranks that you

379
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,004
came up,

380
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,251
uh,

381
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:44,491
you know,

382
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:48,270
97% of practicing scientists or
something like that don't believe in God.

383
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,800
And maybe it's not that high,

384
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,090
but 97% definitely,

385
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,420
you know,

386
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,010
know that global warming is true.

387
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
And maybe

388
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,440
it's something like 75% in
America don't believe in God,

389
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,690
but we're like a very religious country.

390
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,350
But when you kind of go through the
motions and you just come to these logical

391
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,750
conclusions because of all of the
different life choices you've made,

392
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:08,740
but then you interact with people who
are from such different backgrounds,

393
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,510
who have never studied evolution,

394
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:11,530
who have never studied,

395
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:11,981
you know,

396
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,210
global climate change or whatever.

397
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:18,040
It's like talking to a wall sometimes
because you almost can't have the same

398
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,580
kind of reasonable conversations because
when you're talking to somebody who's

399
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,270
not coming from a rational
evidence based place,

400
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,740
who's coming from kind of appeals to
emotion or who's coming from folklore or

401
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,670
whatever reason,

402
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,310
they have to defend their
kind of belief structure,

403
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,420
their faith position.

404
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,020
It's really frustrating because you don't
really have a lot of ammunition at a

405
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:38,854
certain point,

406
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,010
but especially when you're talking to
somebody like Deepak Chopra who has like

407
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,700
made a career kind of
being good at debating,

408
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:49,480
who knows exactly the way to twist your
words and to make it sound like what

409
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:50,890
he's speaking is the truth.

410
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,890
And then he's got this like
very benevolent kind of
kind and calm demeanor and

411
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:58,330
he's going to make
Dawkins look like a dick.

412
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,661
Oh,

413
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,050
see,

414
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,640
I didn't think that he did any,

415
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,451
any twisting them.

416
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,284
Any words at all?

417
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,950
Oh really?

418
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,250
No,

419
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,520
no.

420
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,031
I think,

421
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:04,420
you know,

422
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,370
he seemed like a woo peddler.

423
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:06,881
I mean,

424
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:07,930
to use your term,

425
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,171
he,

426
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,340
that's what he seemed like.

427
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,940
But Dawkins was just getting so
angry and it's that old saying,

428
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:13,270
you know,

429
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,560
never argue with an idiot,

430
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,630
cause people won't be
able to tell who's who.

431
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,440
That's not the same.

432
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,300
I don't know how it works for me.

433
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:19,901
I would never,

434
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:20,140
like,

435
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,550
I would never debate a creation.

436
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,180
It's like people say,

437
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,391
Oh,

438
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:22,871
you should blah,

439
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:22,991
blah,

440
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:23,171
blah.

441
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:24,250
And I think like Bill Nye,

442
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,120
I dunno if it's happened yet,

443
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,220
but they'll nice of us to debate Ken Ham.

444
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,300
That's insane.

445
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,680
I don't know why he's doing it.

446
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,190
I mean,

447
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,090
I have friends,

448
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:31,211
you know,

449
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm friends with Sean Carroll,

450
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:35,830
who's a physicist at Caltech and
writes these really great books about,

451
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,020
about time and about,

452
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,830
um,

453
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,490
uh,

454
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,270
quantum physics.

455
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,860
And he does periodically
debate creationists.

456
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:45,281
And I'm always like,

457
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,560
what are you doing that's,

458
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,890
that's like such a bad idea.

459
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:48,191
You know,

460
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:48,640
like,

461
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,000
because these people are skilled
just in the art of conversation.

462
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,350
They're skilled in the art of debate.

463
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,690
Even if what they're saying has no weight,

464
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,500
they know how to argue these positions
and try and trap you and get you on the

465
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:00,010
defensive.

466
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,400
They have all of these
different kind of uh,

467
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,140
uh,

468
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,973
skillsets,

469
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,350
but he always says,

470
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,210
it's not for me.

471
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,430
It's not to try and prove him wrong.

472
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,460
It's not to try and convince
him not to believe in God.

473
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:12,791
You know,

474
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,070
like this guy is it.

475
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,680
Ken Ham is like a hardcore
fundamentalist Christian.

476
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,390
We're never going to change his mind.

477
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,390
So they say the reason that we do
these debates is for the people who are

478
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,100
sitting there watching who may be like,

479
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,281
Ooh,

480
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,560
I don't know the difference between
evolution and intelligent design.

481
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,430
I've never thought about it.

482
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:32,170
I've never really looked at the evidence
that may be even a small percentage of

483
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,210
the people who decide to tune in.

484
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,920
We'll be given some sort of information
that they didn't have before that they

485
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,170
can be armed with to
make better decisions.

486
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,250
But I don't know.

487
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,480
To me it just seems like,

488
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,580
I mean I think it's a noble pursuit,

489
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,600
but at the same time,

490
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,320
I'm not sure how effective it
really is to debate a creationist.

491
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,980
I say I disagree with you.

492
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,850
I think it's,

493
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,190
I don't think you're going
to convince the creationist.

494
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,790
No,

495
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,390
not at all.

496
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,240
But I do think that there's,

497
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:01,250
there's value in someone who's good at it.

498
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:06,490
If someone has the ability to speak and
speak well and also they have to have a

499
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:07,820
certain amount of charisma.

500
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,130
And the issue,

501
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,780
the Dawkins issue is that he gets so
emotionally invested in this fucking

502
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:19,190
horseshit that Depok spewing that he
gets angry and furious instead of mocking

503
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:19,311
him.

504
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:21,440
Like there's a brilliant exchange with a,

505
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,510
there was a scientist,

506
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,171
there was a,

507
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:23,331
a,

508
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:25,940
a panel and Deepak was
on the panel and this,

509
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:26,271
this,

510
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:26,420
uh,

511
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,130
scientists stepped up and,

512
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,550
uh,

513
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,450
ask Depok a question and Eh,

514
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,090
Depok clearly didn't know what
the fuck he was talking about.

515
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:40,210
But the way the guy handled it was very
sweet and he was smiling while he did

516
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,900
explain that he was in the process of
writing a book with Stephen Hawkings and

517
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:47,570
then he was in the middle of
this and then that I don't,

518
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:47,901
he's like,

519
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,460
I understand those words you said,

520
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,091
but uh,

521
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm not sure if they mean anything.

522
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,180
The way he said it was,

523
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,290
it was adorable.

524
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:54,680
Like,

525
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,520
cause the guy didn't lose his cool and
it made Depok look like a fucking idiot.

526
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,011
Where's it at?

527
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:00,680
The same guy got up and said,

528
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,340
you know,

529
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,960
what is this quantum talk?

530
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,470
You're talking a bunch of fucking
bullshit and shut up and you don't know.

531
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,850
Then all of a sudden,

532
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:07,971
you know,

533
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:12,740
Deepak is this pudgy Indian
man that you're picking up
the screams of racism and

534
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,510
all this other fucking
hot buttons get pushed.

535
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,070
And I think the same thing can be
done skillfully with these creationist

536
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:19,491
fellows.

537
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,330
Like shy.

538
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,510
I think the idea behind creationism is
so preposterous that in the form that we

539
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,070
see it in the form of,

540
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,550
you know,

541
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,791
not,

542
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,190
not in the form of something
created the universe,

543
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,370
whether it's some sort of a universal
force that creates stars or the reason why

544
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,050
Adam's exists in the first place.

545
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,140
All these like fundamental questions
that scientists have as to why the

546
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:44,240
structure of the universe is what it is.

547
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,493
There's that,

548
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,700
but then there's this book that has been
translated from other books and then

549
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,890
they're sticking to
this fucking crazy book.

550
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,470
Just point out the other shit
in the book that's ridiculous.

551
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,480
Like the shit in the book about not being
on the word to deploy different types

552
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,340
types of cloth.

553
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,151
And they do that.

554
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,320
Usually they'll point
out the shit in the book.

555
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:00,951
That's ridiculous.

556
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,030
And they figure out,

557
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,390
you know,

558
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,380
and point out how,

559
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,520
if the book says this,

560
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:09,521
you truly believe this in this century
and science has unequivocally disproven

561
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,110
what it is that you believe.

562
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:12,321
You know,

563
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,220
it's one thing to talk about,

564
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,054
like you said,

565
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,900
uh,

566
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,141
you know,

567
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:18,680
these big questions like what came before
the Big Bang or you know what a lot

568
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:18,771
of,

569
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,070
I feel like I'm intelligent
design advocates confused,

570
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:22,791
for example,

571
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,910
evolution via natural
selection with a a biogenesis.

572
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:30,911
So they confuse the idea of
how a organisms have evolved
over time with how life

573
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:33,020
began in the first place,

574
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:35,420
which is a fundamentally
different scientific question,

575
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,111
different topic,

576
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,210
totally different field of inquiry.

577
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,051
And so,

578
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:39,470
you know,

579
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,690
a lot of times what they do is
they appeal to these two questions.

580
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,380
They say like,

581
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,531
well,

582
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,360
you don't know what existed
before the Big Bang,

583
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,910
therefore God done Mike Drop,

584
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,240
you know,

585
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,073
every time.

586
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,100
And instead of kind

587
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,210
of allowing that,

588
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,140
it's to say,

589
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:52,531
you know,

590
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:52,920
okay,

591
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,753
neither of us know why.

592
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,100
Why has God the,

593
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,993
the first,

594
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,173
you know,

595
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,650
answer that you jumped to,

596
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:02,040
let's look at all the other times when
you're saying that the answer is God and

597
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,460
we've disproven it over
and over and over and over.

598
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:09,690
And just because we don't have all of
the answers to every question right now

599
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:11,640
using the scientific
method doesn't mean that,

600
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,211
you know,

601
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:13,440
through through new tools,

602
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:17,190
through new lines of inquiry that we
might be able to answer those in the

603
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:17,940
future.

604
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,290
It doesn't mean that like,

605
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,280
just because we don't have,

606
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:23,730
that doesn't mean that there aren't
other philosophical answers to these

607
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:27,180
questions that don't rely on this
like very fundamentalist view.

608
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,460
I think personally that for example,

609
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,020
Bill Nye is going to be
able to hold his own.

610
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:32,400
He's a total bad ass.

611
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,320
He's not going to lose
his cool and Ken Ham,

612
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,210
if you've ever watched him in PE,

613
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,830
I mean he's a nut job.

614
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,440
Like he's a total pull up some videos,

615
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,770
he's a total nutter butter and he will
lose his cool and he's totally not

616
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,570
likable like nothing about this guy.

617
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:46,201
He's likable.

618
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:50,250
So I think that maybe that's why bill and
I was willing to do it cause I've seen

619
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:50,641
Bill Nye,

620
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:50,881
right?

621
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:55,740
Go on like Bill O'reilly a million times
and there's kind of a mutual respect

622
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:56,011
there.

623
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:56,141
He,

624
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:58,740
he deals with bill O'Reilly very well,

625
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,880
and I'm always impressed.

626
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,510
And just one,

627
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,060
one is the tide comes in.

628
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,233
Yeah.

629
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:04,850
Yeah.

630
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,820
You can't explain that.

631
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah,

632
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,833
he was with Steve.

633
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,140
Yeah.

634
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,640
Yeah.

635
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,473
And he's,

636
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,680
it was so fucking funny.

637
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,620
Such a face balm.
